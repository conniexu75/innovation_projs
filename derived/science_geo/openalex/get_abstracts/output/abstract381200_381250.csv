https://openalex.org/W2127902738,"The self-assembly of colloids is an alternative to top-down processing that enables the fabrication of nanostructures. We show that self-assembled clusters of metal-dielectric spheres are the basis for nanophotonic structures. By tailoring the number and position of spheres in close-packed clusters, plasmon modes exhibiting strong magnetic and Fano-like resonances emerge. The use of identical spheres simplifies cluster assembly and facilitates the fabrication of highly symmetric structures. Dielectric spacers are used to tailor the interparticle spacing in these clusters to be approximately 2 nanometers. These types of chemically synthesized nanoparticle clusters can be generalized to other two- and three-dimensional structures and can serve as building blocks for new metamaterials."

Distinct neural signatures for model-based and model-free reinforcement learning Neural correlate of state prediction error (SPE) in the IPS and lateral PFC Neural correlate of reward prediction error (RPE) in the ventral striatum Model-based learning via an SPE is also present in the absence of reward information One of the most critical divisions in early-20th century animal learning psychology was that between behaviorist notions such as Thorndike's (Thorndike, 1933Thorndike E.L. A Proof of the Law of Effect.Science. 1933; 77: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), that responses are triggered by stimuli through associations strengthened by reinforcement, and Tolman's proposal (Tolman, 1948Tolman E.C. Cognitive maps in rats and men.Psychol. Rev. 1948; 55: 189-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar), that they are instead planned using an internal representation of environmental contingencies in the form of a “cognitive map.” Although the original debate has relaxed into a compromise position, with evidence at least in rats that both mechanisms exist and adapt simultaneously (Dickinson and Balleine, 2002Dickinson A. Balleine B. The role of learning in motivation.in: Gallistel C. Stevens' Handbook of Experimental Psychology. Wiley, New York, NY2002Google Scholar), a full characterization of their different learning properties and the way that their outputs are integrated to achieve better control is as yet missing. Here, we adopt specific computational definitions that have been proposed to capture the two different structures of learning. We use them to seek evidence of the two strategies in signals measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans learning to solve a probabilistic Markov decision task. Theoretical work has considered the two strategies to be model-free and model-based, and has suggested how their outputs might be combined depending on their respective certainties (Daw et al., 2005Daw N.D. Niv Y. Dayan P. Uncertainty-based competition between prefrontal and dorsolateral striatal systems for behavioral control.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1704-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar, Doya et al., 2002Doya K. Samejima K. Katagiri K. Kawato M. Multiple model-based reinforcement learning.Neural Comput. 2002; 14: 1347-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In a model-based system, a cognitive map or model of the environment is acquired, which describes how different “states” (or situations) of the world are connected to each other. Action values for different paths through this environment can then be computed by a sort of mental simulation analogous to planning chess moves: searching forward along future states to evaluate the rewards available there. This is termed a “forward” or “tree-search” strategy. In contrast, a model-free learning system learns action values directly, by trial and error, without building an explicit model of the environment, and thus retains no explicit estimate of the probabilities that govern state transitions (Daw et al., 2005Daw N.D. Niv Y. Dayan P. Uncertainty-based competition between prefrontal and dorsolateral striatal systems for behavioral control.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1704-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). Because these approaches evaluate actions using different underlying representations, they produce different behaviors in experiments aimed at investigating their psychological counterparts. Most such experiments (Dickinson and Balleine, 2002Dickinson A. Balleine B. The role of learning in motivation.in: Gallistel C. Stevens' Handbook of Experimental Psychology. Wiley, New York, NY2002Google Scholar) study whether animals adapt immediately to changes in the environment. For instance, in classic “latent learning” studies (Tolman and Honzik, 1930Tolman E.C. Honzik C.H. Introduction and Removal of Reward, and Maze Performance in Rats.University of California Publications in Psychology. 1930; 4: 257-275Google Scholar), animals are pretrained on a maze, then rewards are introduced at a particular location to probe whether subjects can plan new routes there taking into account previously learned knowledge of the maze layout. The experiment discussed here, though nonspatial, follows this scheme. Learning in both model-based and model-free strategies is typically driven by prediction errors, albeit with different meaning and properties in each case. A prediction error is a difference between an actual and an expected outcome and this signal is commonly thought of as the engine of learning, as it is used to update expectations in order to make predictions more accurate. In the case of model-free learning, this error signal (called the reward prediction error, RPE) amounts to the difference between the actual and expected reward at a particular state. In the context of reinforcement learning (RL), this error signal is used to learn values for action choices that maximize expected future reward (Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R.S. Barto A.G. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar). An abundance of evidence from both single-unit recordings in monkeys (Bayer and Glimcher, 2005Bayer H.M.

Furthermore, BOLD signals in the ventral striatum (vStr) show response properties consistent with dopaminergic input (Delgado et al., 2000Delgado M.R. Nystrom L.E. Fissell C. Noll D.C. Fiez J.A.

Model-based action valuation requires predicting which state is currently expected, given previous states and/or choices. These expectations can be learned using a different prediction error, called the state prediction error (SPE), which measures the surprise in the new state given the current estimate of the state-action-state transition probabilities. The central questions for the current study are whether the human brain computes the SPE as well as the RPE, and, if so, what the different neural signatures of these two signals are. One indication that the brain may compute SPEs is that neural signals marking gross violations of expectations have long been reported, particularly using EEG (Courchesne et al., 1975Courchesne E.

Changes in brain activity patterns in aging: the novelty oddball.Psychophysiology. 1995; 32: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and EEG in combination with fMRI (Opitz et al., 1999Opitz B.

Novelty and target processing during an auditory novelty oddball: a simultaneous event-related potential and functional magnetic resonance imaging study.Neuroimage. 2008; 40: 869-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Unlike the prediction error signals associated with dopamine activity, which are largely reward-focused and associated with model-free RL (Holroyd and Coles, 2002Holroyd C.B. Coles M.G. The neural basis of human error processing: reinforcement learning, dopamine, and the error-related negativity.Psychol. Rev. 2002; 109: 679-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (2777) Google Scholar), these respond to incorrect predictions of affectively neutral stimuli. Here, we study quantitatively how state predictions are learned, and seek trial-by-trial neural signals that reflect the dynamics of this learning. We designed a probabilistic sequential Markov decision task involving choices in two successive internal states, followed by a rewarded outcome state (see Experimental Procedures). The task has the structure of a decision tree, in which each abstract decision state is represented by a fractal image (Figure 1A ). In each trial, the participants begin at the same starting state and choose between a left or right button press. Probabilistically, they reach one of two subsequent states, each of which presents another choice between a left or right action. Finally, they reach one of three probabilistic outcome states providing a reward of 0¢, 10¢, or 25¢. In order to dissociate SPEs and RPEs, volunteers were first exposed to just the state space in the absence of any rewards, much as in a latent learning design. This provides a pure assessment of an SPE. Further, to ensure adequate and equivalent experience, all choices in the first scanning session were instructed; subjects only had to register them with the respective button press (Figure 1B). The instructed choices in session 1 were created so as to reflect the underlying transition probabilities of the decision tree exactly, albeit in a randomized order. Next, during a break, the subjects were told the reward contingencies and rehearsed the reward mapping with a simple choice task (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures, available online). Finally, in the second scanning session, they were able to make choices on their own to gain rewards at the outcome states (Figure 1B). We hypothesized that participants would acquire knowledge about the transition probabilities during session 1, despite the absence of any rewarding outcomes. This state knowledge can therefore be only acquired through model-based learning, potentially updated via an SPE. Behaviorally, such knowledge is “latent” during the first session and its presence or absence can only be revealed subsequently when employed to guide choices toward reward. However, we sought neural evidence of state expectation formation during initial training. Specifically, we expected to see correlates of SPEs, perhaps in the lateral prefrontal cortex (latPFC), an area which has previously been suggested to be involved in model-based RL (Samejima and Doya, 2007Samejima K. Doya K. Multiple representations of belief states and action values in corticobasal ganglia loops.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2007; 1104: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that such signals would be distinct from neural RPEs, which are often reported in the vStr (Haruno and Kawato, 2006Haruno M. Kawato M.

Temporal difference models describe higher-order learning in humans.Nature. 2004; 429: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). We first assessed the participants' performance at the beginning of the free-choice session, as a simple test of whether they were able to make optimal choices by combining the knowledge they acquired about state transitions and reward contingencies. In terms of the two learning approaches described above, this would be possible with model-based, but not model-free, learning, because the latter focuses exclusively on predicting rewards without building a model of the environment and therefore learns nothing during session 1. If, in accordance with the model-based theory, the subjects were able to combine their knowledge of the state space with the reward information presented prior to session 2, their first choice in session 2 would be better than chance. Indeed, of all 18 subjects, 13 chose R (the optimal choice) and 5 chose L in state 1 in the very first trial of session 2 (p < 0.05, sign-test, one-tailed), indicating that their choice of behavior cannot be completely explained by traditional model-free reward learning theory. In order to assess the behavioral and neural manifestations of state and reward learning more precisely, we formalized the computational approaches described above as trial-by-trial mathematical models. Based on recent empirical support (Morris et al., 2006Morris G. Nevet A. Arkadir D. Vaadia E. Bergman H. Midbrain dopamine neurons encode decisions for future action.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), we used a variant of model-free RL, the so-called SARSA learner (state-action-reward-state-action) for implementing value learning via an RPE. By contrast, our model-based FORWARD learner learned a state transition model via an SPE (see Figure 2 and Experimental Procedures), and used this to evaluate actions. In the second session, the mean correlation of these prediction error signals from both models was −0.37 (±0.09 SD) across all subjects. (In the first session, the RPE is 0 throughout, due to the lack of rewards, and only the SPE is nonzero.) Finally, since previous theoretical proposals suggest that the brain implements both approaches (Daw et al., 2005Daw N.D. Niv Y. Dayan P. Uncertainty-based competition between prefrontal and dorsolateral striatal systems for behavioral control.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1704-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar, Doya, 1999Doya K.

Katagiri K. Kawato M. Multiple model-based reinforcement learning.Neural Comput. 2002; 14: 1347-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), we implemented a HYBRID learner that chooses actions by forming a weighted average of the action valuations from the SARSA and FORWARD learners. The relative weighting is expected to change over time; indeed, given suitable prior expectations, there are normative proposals for determining how (Daw et al., 2005Daw N.D. Niv Y. Dayan P. Uncertainty-based competition between prefrontal and dorsolateral striatal systems for behavioral control.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1704-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar) (see also Behrens et al., 2007Behrens T.E. Woolrich M.W. Walton M.E. Rushworth M.F. Learning the value of information in an uncertain world.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1214-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Given the singularity of the transition from nonrewarded to rewarded trials, we built three simple models for the change in weighting over time, finding that an exponential decay from FORWARD to SARSA (Camerer and Ho, 1998Camerer C. Ho T.H. Experience-Weighted Attraction Learning in Coordination Games: Probability Rules, Heterogeneity, and Time-Variation.J. Math. Psychol. 1998; 42: 305-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Figure 2) fitted best (see Table S1, available online). These models not only make different predictions about the first free-choice trial, as examined thus far, but also about how subjects adjust their choice preferences, trial by trial, in response to feedback thereafter. In order to test whether either model or their combination best accounted for these adjustments, we fitted the free parameters for each model across subjects by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the obtained choice data over the entire free-choice session. The fit parameters, the resulting model likelihoods, and Akaike's information criteria (AIC) are outlined in Table 1 (actual experiment). Thus fit, the HYBRID learner provided a significantly more accurate explanation of behavior than did SARSA or the FORWARD learner alone even after accounting for the different numbers of free parameters (likelihood ratio tests, HYBRID versus SARSA: χ2(2) = 21.32, p = 2.35 × 10−5; HYBRID versus FORWARD: χ2(2) = 224.94, p = 0). The expected values and estimated state transition probabilities from all models are visualized in Figure S2 (available online) for the optimal choice trajectory. Finally, we also computed the probability of correctly predicted choices by our HYBRID model and a pseudo-R2 measure for each participant (Daw et al., 2006Daw N.D. O'Doherty J.P. Dayan P. Seymour B. Dolan R.J. Cortical substrates for exploratory decisions in humans.Nature. 2006; 441: 876-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar) that indicating how much better our HYBRID learner performs compared to a null model of random choices for each subject (Table S2).Table 1Behavioral Model FitParameterActual ExperimentRandom Trial SequenceSARSA learning rate0.200.37 (0.19–0.65)FORWARD learning rate0.210.29 (0.21–0.44)Offset for exp. decay0.630.40 (0.20–0.64)Slope of exp. decay0.090.53 (0.20–0.93)Inverse softmax temperature4.913.75 (2.22–4.82)LikAICLikAICSARSA1217.942439.88FORWARD1319.752643.49HYBRID1202.282414.561256.562523.12Model parameters, negative model likelihoods (Lik), and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), for the actual experiment and for the permutation analysis with random trial sequences.

The latter lists the median parameter value from 1000 permutation samples and the interquartile range (25th–75th percentile). We conducted an additional analysis to demonstrate in great detail how behavioral choices are affected by model-based learning. Although the entirety of all predetermined trials in session 1 reflected the true transition probabilities exactly, the specific random sequence of these trials in each participant would create different learning trajectories. If participants' beliefs about the transition probabilities were updated by error-driven model-based learning (with a fixed learning rate, as assumed in FORWARD), this may have left a bias toward the most recently experienced transitions, resulting in particular beliefs at the end of the session. These particular beliefs could in turn lead to subject-specific choice trajectories as session 2 progressed, which would be reflected in the fit of the model to those choices. Conversely, if the subjects did not learn anything about the transition probabilities from their particular transitions using an SPE (with a fixed learning rate), then we would not expect any influence of their particular sequence of trials in session 1 on their choices in session 2. Thus, in the case of no model-based learning in session 1, any sequence of trials (including the actually experienced sequence) should lead to the same quality of model fit to the choices, whereas in the case of state learning with the FORWARD model, we would expect a better model fit under the actual trial sequence compared to any other random sequence. We tested this by refitting the model 1000 times using randomly permuted session 1 trial sequences and randomly permuted intermediate states (See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details), and compared the model fit for the session 2 choices against the fit based on the actual trial sequence. The results of this additional analysis are presented in Table 1 (random trial sequence) and confirm that our participants had indeed acquired knowledge about the particular sequence of state transitions during the first session: 99.6% of permutation samples provided a poorer explanation of choices than the original (p = 0.004). In conclusion, the behavioral results indicate (1) that the participants successfully acquired knowledge about the state transition probabilities in session 1 through a model-based FORWARD learner and (2) that the participants' behavior reflects both model-based and model-free learning processes. This invites a search for their neural manifestations in terms of SPEs and RPEs. We sought neural correlates of the prediction errors from both models. For this, we derived an RPE from the SARSA learner for session 2 and an SPE from the FORWARD learner for both sessions and included them as parametric modulators at the second decision state and the final outcome state in the single-subject analyses (see Experimental Procedures). The voxel-wise parameter estimate (beta) for these regressors indicates how strongly a particular brain area covaries with these model-derived prediction errors. These beta images were included in a repeated-measures ANOVA at the second level testing for the effect of each error signal across the group (see Experimental Procedures). In order to determine those brain areas that covaried with the SPE, we pooled across both sessions and found significant effects bilaterally in the posterior intraparietal sulcus (pIPS) reaching on the left side into the superior parietal lobule and on the right side into the angular gyrus, and in the lateral prefrontal cortex (latPFC) (dorsal bank of the posterior inferior frontal gyrus [pIFG], see circled areas in Figures 3A and 3B and Table 2). Other effects visible in Figure 3A (e.g., inferior temporal gyrus) did not meet our statistical threshold for whole-brain correction and are not further discussed. The graphs show the average percent signal change (PSC) in BOLD activation across subjects for both prediction error signals on trials in which that error signal was low, medium, or high (bins defined at 33rd, 66th, and 100th percentile, see Experimental Procedures for details). This reveals a linear increase in BOLD activation across trials with increasing SPEs, except for the left IPS, in which the increase in BOLD activation occurs only for trials with the highest SPE. In contrast, there is no such systematic relationship between BOLD activation and the RPE.Table 2Statistical ResultsContrastRegionHemiBAxyzZpAverage SPE in both sessionspost IPS/SPLL7−27−54455.290.004post IPS/angular gyrusR4039−54395.120.009latPFC (dorsal pIFG)L44−459335.62<0.001latPFC (dorsal pIFG)R444512304.730.049Reward prediction error in session 2ventral striatumL25−126−95.180.006SPE signals in session 1 (within sphere [10 mm radius] based on SPE signals in session 2)post IPSL7n.s.post IPS/angular gyrusR4036−66393.680.01∗latPFC (dorsal pIFG)L44−399334.490.001∗latPFC (dorsal pIFG)R44489363.200.039∗484515303.120.049∗Conjunction between SPE signals from both sessionslatPFC (dorsal pIFG)L44−399334.49<0.001∗∗latPFC (dorsal pIFG)R44489363.200.001∗∗post IPS/angular gyrusR4033−66393.75<0.001∗∗post IPS/angular gyrusR4039−54393.31<0.001∗∗SPE in both session > unsigned reward prediction error [abs(RPE)]Post IPS/angular gyrusR4036−66395.49<0.001All peaks are corrected for the entire brain volume at p < 0.05 unless stated otherwise.

Conversely, when we tested for a correlation between BOLD activation and the RPE, we found a significant effect in the vStr (Figure 3C), consistent with previous accounts (McClure et al., 2003McClure S.M.

The graph of the average PSC across subjects in this region shows the opposite pattern from that in the pIPS and latPFC: a linear increase in BOLD activity across trials with increasing RPE, but no such increase for the SPE. In a follow-up analysis, to investigate the consistency of SPE results between the sessions, we identified the peak voxels for the SPE signal in session 2 only, and then tested for a significant SPE representation in session 1 in a reduced spherical search volume (radius: 10 mm, p < 0.05, family-wise error [FWE] correction for search volume). This procedure ensures that the centers for the search volumes are selected in a way that is independent of the data in session 1.

Chase (p. 1388 , published online 27 May) presents results from a 7-year experiment in artificial ponds. β-diversity (the variation in species composition from site to site) in animal species was persistently higher at higher productivity among otherwise homogeneous environments in this controlled experimental venue. This pattern appeared to result from shifts in the relative importance of deterministic versus stochastic community assembly mechanisms along the productivity gradient. Thus, variation in the mechanism of community assembly might be an important process determining the relationship between biodiversity and productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2039390702,"Bacterial (Interferon)ce Intracellular bacterial pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes , are detected in the cytosol of host immune cells, where they induce a host response that is often dependent on microbial secretion systems. Woodward et al. (p. 1703 , published online 27 May) now show that L. monocytogenes produce and release cyclic diadenosine monophosphate into the host cytosol, which induces the production of host type I interferon. Because a number of intracellular pathogens contain the protein machinery to generate this nucleotide and also activate this same innate immune pathway, a common molecular mechanism may exist for host detection of cytosolic bacterial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2086338749,"The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates mitogen and nutrient signals to control cell proliferation and cell size. Hence, mTORC1 is implicated in a large number of human diseases--including diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and cancer--that are characterized by aberrant cell growth and proliferation. Although eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) are critical mediators of mTORC1 function, their precise contribution to mTORC1 signaling and the mechanisms by which they mediate mTORC1 function have remained unclear. We inhibited the mTORC1 pathway in cells lacking 4E-BPs and analyzed the effects on cell size, cell proliferation, and cell cycle progression. Although the 4E-BPs had no effect on cell size, they inhibited cell proliferation by selectively inhibiting the translation of messenger RNAs that encode proliferation-promoting proteins and proteins involved in cell cycle progression. Thus, control of cell size and cell cycle progression appear to be independent in mammalian cells, whereas in lower eukaryotes, 4E-BPs influence both cell growth and proliferation."

Many such peptides act by disrupting the bacterial membrane; however, Schneider et al. (p. 1168 ) now show that the fungal defensin, plecstasin, targets cell wall biosynthesis. Biochemical studies identified Lipid II as the cellular target of plecstasin and the residues involved in complex formation were identified using NMR spectroscopy and computational modeling. Initial studies identified two defensins from invertebrates that also target Lipid II. Plecstasin is active against some drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, and its action against a validated target makes it a promising lead for further drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2031156443,"Nucleosome disruption and replacement are crucial activities that maintain epigenomes, but these highly dynamic processes have been difficult to study. Here, we describe a direct method for measuring nucleosome turnover dynamics genome-wide. We found that nucleosome turnover is most rapid over active gene bodies, epigenetic regulatory elements, and replication origins in Drosophila cells. Nucleosomes turn over faster at sites for trithorax-group than polycomb-group protein binding, suggesting that nucleosome turnover differences underlie their opposing activities and challenging models for epigenetic inheritance that rely on stability of histone marks. Our results establish a general strategy for studying nucleosome dynamics and uncover nucleosome turnover differences across the genome that are likely to have functional importance for epigenome maintenance, gene regulation, and control of DNA replication."

https://openalex.org/W2026173372,"Taking the Rough with the Smooth Even with extensive annealing at high temperatures, most polycrystalline materials will not become a perfect single crystal, which would represent the thermodynamically preferred state. The stability of the polycrystalline state has been attributed to the presence of impurities that accumulate at the grain boundaries, but even very pure materials show grain growth stagnation. Using simulations, Holm and Foiles (p. 1138 ) show that grain boundaries can be classified as “rough” and “smooth.” Rough boundaries move continuously with well-defined activation energies, while the smooth boundaries have low mobility and move in a jerky, stepwise manner. With heating, a boundary can change from smooth to rough, but the transition temperature can vary by hundreds of degrees from one grain boundary to the next. These smooth, low-mobility boundaries thus pin the polycrystalline structure, even in the absence of impurities."
https://openalex.org/W2006510915,"The mechanism by which multispanning helix-bundle membrane proteins are inserted into their target membrane remains unclear. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, membrane proteins are inserted cotranslationally into the lipid bilayer. Positively charged residues flanking the transmembrane helices are important topological determinants, but it is not known whether they act strictly locally, affecting only the nearest transmembrane helices, or can act globally, affecting the topology of the entire protein. Here we found that the topology of an Escherichia coli inner membrane protein with four or five transmembrane helices could be controlled by a single positively charged residue placed in different locations throughout the protein, including the very C terminus. This observation points to an unanticipated plasticity in membrane protein insertion mechanisms."

We present evidence that an HGT event moved a nuclear monocot gene into the genome of the eudicot parasite witchweed (Striga hermonthica), which infects many grass species in Africa. Analysis of expressed sequence tags revealed that the genome of S. hermonthica contains a nuclear gene that is widely conserved among grass species but is not found in other eudicots. Phylogenetically, this gene clusters with sorghum genes, the monocot host of the parasitic weed, suggesting that nuclear genes can be captured by parasitic weeds in nature."

SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney cells (COS-1) and Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO)-KI cells were grown in Dulbecco′s modified Eagle′s medium (Sigma), 4 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen; Complete medium). Cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/60-mm dish and grown overnight until 95% confluence. Transient transfection of the cells was performed using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In some experiments, after 40 h of transfection, the cells were treated for 8 h with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (25 μm, Calbiochem). Co-transfection with pEGFP-C1 revealed a transfection efficiency of about 45%. For selection of stable transfected clones expressing pcDNA3/6myc or pcDNA3/6myc-HAS2, 24 h after transfection, CHO-KI cells were passaged in medium containing 600 μg of G418/ml, at 1:10 series dilutions. Hyaluronan synthesized de novo by untransfected COS-1 cells or COS-1 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3 vector alone (mock) as well as with tagged HAS2 or HAS3 constructs, was determined after different time periods by using a microtiter-based assay, as described previously (28Li L. Asteriou T. Bernert B. Heldin C.H. Heldin P. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similarly, the hyaluronan-synthesizing capacity of CHO-KI cells stably transfected with 6myc-HAS2, was also determined. This assay is based on the specific binding of hyaluronan to the G1 globular domain of aggrecan. Briefly, conditioned media obtained at different time points after the transfections were added to a 96-well microtiter plate (MaxiSorp Nunc-Immuno plates, Nalge Nunc International) precoated with G1 protein. As a standard, highly purified hyaluronan (0–100 ng/ml, Q-Med, Uppsala, Sweden) were used. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, samples were incubated for another hour with biotinylated G1 protein; its binding to hyaluronan was then determined by incubation for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:1600 diluted; RPN 1051, GE Healthcare), followed by washings and incubation for 15 min with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl-benzidine liquid substrate for ELISA (Supersensitive; T4444, Sigma). The reaction was stopped with H2SO4, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using an ELISA reader. The intervariation of this assay is less than 10%. Cell monolayers were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into sucrose buffer: 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.25 m sucrose, supplemented with protein inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml pefabloc, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT). Then samples were sonicated and subjected to centrifugation in a Beckman Ultra-Centrifuge TL-100 with a TLS-55 rotor at 43,000 rpm (150,000 × g) for 60 min at 4 °C, using Ultra-Clear centrifuge tubes (11 × 34 mm, Beckman). The high speed pellets (membrane fractions) were resuspended in 600 μl of TBS/Ca2+ buffer (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8), supplemented with 0.1% SDS and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 as well as the protease inhibitors described above, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. In some of the experiments, the TBS/Ca2+ buffer was in addition to protease inhibitors supplemented with 1% SDS or 1% digitonin. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the protein concentration in the supernatant was measured using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit (Pierce). Then, samples were divided to be processed for immunoprecipitation (250 μg of protein each) and immunoblotting (30 μg of protein each). For immunoblotting, aliquots from membrane fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gels and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C extra). All samples were reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Nonspecific binding sites on membranes were blocked for 3 h at room temperature with 3% nonfat dried milk in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20), followed by overnight incubation with anti-Flag, anti-Myc, or anti-HA monoclonal antibody at dilutions of 1:1000, 1:800, or 1:200 in1% bovine serum albumin/TBS-T, respectively. HASs were also detected with anti-HAS2 IgG (5 μg/ml; Ref. 28Li L. Asteriou T. Bernert B. Heldin C.H. Heldin P. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and anti-HAS3 IgG (1 μg/ml). For ubiquitination studies, the anti-ubiquitin P4D1 antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:200. After four washes, membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at a 1:10,000 dilution in blocking solution. The immunocomplexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions. For re-blotting, the membranes were stripped with stripping buffer (0.2 m NaOH, 0.5 m NaCl) for 10 min and reblotted with antibodies, as specified above. Silver staining was performed, as described before (32Schevchenko V.A. Akayeva E.A. Yeliseyeva I.M. Yelisova T.V. Yofa E.L. Nilova I.N. Syomov A.B. Burkart W. Mutat. Res. 1996; 361: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation, sample aliquots from membrane fractions solubilized in TBS/Ca2+ buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 or 1% digitonin were precleared by protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry in TBS/Ca2+ buffer; GE Healthcare) before 2 μg of anti-Flag, 1 μg of anti-Myc, or 1 μg of anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were added followed by 2 h incubation at 4 °C. Samples solubilized with TBS/Ca2+ buffer containing 1% SDS, were diluted 2-fold before pre-clearing. Then, 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose was added, and the mixtures were incubated for an additional 1 h, at 4 °C, followed by washing (3500 rpm for 3 min). After resuspension in loading buffer, samples were subjected to immunoblotting. Bands observed at molecular masses of 53–58 kDa (for the Flag-HAS2 transfectants), 65–74 kDa (for the 6myc-HAS2 transfectants) and molecular mass species of about 120 kDa were excised from silver-stained gels and treated for in-gel digestion, as described (33Hellman U. EXS. 2000; 88: 43-54PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the bands were destained and dried, then trypsin (sequence grade porcine, modified, Promega) was added, and the samples were digested overnight at 30 °C. The peptide mixtures were concentrated and desalted on a μZipTip C18 (Millipore) and applied directly to the sample target. The peptide mass fingerprints were obtained on an Ultraflex TOF/TOF MALDI mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) using α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid as matrix. The identities of the protein bands were obtained by scanning the sequence data base NCBInr using the search engine ProFound with the peptide mass lists. The potential presence of Ub in samples of slower migrating species with about 5–9 kDa higher molecular mass was analyzed using GPMAW (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark) by allowing the addition of tryptic peptides from the C-terminal part of Ub to a lysine residue, i.e. GG (114.05 Da) or LRGG (383.24 Da), to the mass of the predicted tryptic peptides of HAS2. Point mutants of Lys-190 in pcDNA3-Flag-HAS2 and pcDNA3–6myc-HAS2 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The following mutagenic primer and its complementary were designed to change Lys to Arg (R) at position 190 (K190R; primer is shown in the sense orientation with the altered codon in boldface, 5′-ATGCAAAAATGGGGTGGAAGGAGAGAAGTCATGTACACAGCC-3′). The site-directed mutagenesis was performed using two QuikChange (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pcDNA3 plasmid containing either the Flag-HAS2 or the 6myc-HAS2 transcripts were used as a template for the primer extension reactions with the pair of mutagenic primers. Mutant strand synthesis reaction was performed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and pfu DNA polymerase. PCR was performed for 18 cycles: 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 15 s, and 78 °C for 3 min. The amplification products were treated with DpnI to digest the parental methylated and hemimethylated DNA at 37 °C for 1 h. The digested reaction was transformed into DH5α competent cells, purified using the Nucleospin Plasmid (Macherey-Nagel), and colonies were screened for the desired mutations by sequencing isolated DNA using ABI Prism 310 genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The expression and activity of Flag-HAS2 and 6myc-HAS2 proteins were studied in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. Both constructs gave rise to active HAS molecules, as revealed by increased hyaluronan synthesis (Fig. 1A and subsequent figures). Total cell lysate as well as anti-Flag- or anti-Myc-immunoprecipitated material were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1, A and B). Initially, as a way to ensure efficient solubilization of Flag- and 6myc-HAS2 proteins from COS-1 membrane fraction, the ionic detergent SDS at a concentration of 1% was used. In addition to the 65-kDa 6myc-HAS2 species, bands of 74 kDa and about 130–170 kDa (Fig. 1A) were detected. Notably, the 74-kDa component (marked with an open arrowhead) was readily detected 24–48 h after transfection, coincident with increase in the amount of synthesized hyaluronan by 6myc-HAS2 transfectants. Similarly, in addition to the Flag-HAS2 band of a molecular mass of about 53 kDa other immunoreactive bands of 58 kDa and about 110 kDa were seen using anti-CGR antibodies against the Flag-HAS2 (Fig. 1B and Ref. 28Li L. Asteriou T. Bernert B. Heldin C.H. Heldin P. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained by extraction with TBS/Ca2+ buffer supplemented with 1% digitonin (supplemental Fig. S1) or supplemented with 0.1% SDS and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, which was used for all subsequent experiments (Fig. 1B). No differences in the pattern of immunoreactive bands were observed when the SDS-PAGE was performed under non-reducing compared with reducing conditions (data not shown). To identify the silver-stained proteins (Fig. 1B), analysis by mass spectrometry and peptide mass fingerprinting was performed. This analysis identified the 53-kDa band to be the mouse HAS2 isoform (Table 1, sequence coverage was 32%). In addition, material excised from the 110-kDa species of silver-stained gels indicated the presence of HAS2 (the sequence coverage was 18%), suggesting that HAS2 may form dimers (data not shown).TABLE 1Identification of mouse HAS2 by peptide mass fingerprint analysisMeasured massCalculated massError (Da)Residues Start ToMissed cutSequence806.446806.447−0.0016110FLCVLR926.430926.4280.0024214280SSFASCLR944.493944.4820.0103473530WLNQQTR1015.4951015.4790.0151921990EVMYTAFR1171.6001171.5800.0191911991REVMYTAFR1228.5951228.5690.0262602680YWMAFNIER1393.7121393.6900.0223363460CLTETPIEYLR1458.7361458.7140.0222482590YDSWISFLSSVR1523.7211523.7010.0203613710EWLYNAMWFHK1568.8151568.815−0.0001661790ESSQHVTQLVLSNK1996.9491996.956−0.007841000TVALCIAAYQEDPDYLR2068.0352068.050−0.0152282470VLEEDPMVGGVGGDVQILNK2125.0462125.050−0.004841011TVALCIAAYQEDPDYLRK2353.0172353.0100.0072692880ACQSYFGCVQCISGPLGMYR2369.0382369.0050.0332692880ACQSYFGCVQCISGPLGMoxYR2620.3142620.2710.0431561791GPGETEESHKESSQHVTQLVLSNK2674.2472674.1800.0672042270SVDYVQVCDSDTMLDPASSVEMVK Open table in a new tab To verify that HAS2 forms homodimers, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed. Immunoprecipitation by Flag antibodies of lysate from COS-1 cells transfected with Flag-HAS2 and 6myc-HAS2, followed by immunoblotting with Myc antibodies revealed a band at the expected size (Fig. 2A), suggesting the formation of dimers or oligomers. To investigate whether the HAS2 protein in addition to homo-oligomers, can form hetero-oligomers with another HAS isoform, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with 6myc-HAS2 and Flag-HAS3. After immunoprecipitation with Myc anti-serum, immunoblotting with anti-HAS3 antibodies revealed a band of a molecular mass of about 55 kDa, i.e. a similar size as that of the HAS3 band seen in total cell lysates (Fig. 2B). As a control, the filter was then stripped and blotted with a Myc antiserum, which revealed the monomeric 6myc-HAS2 band and the about 8 kDa higher immunoreactive band (marked with an open arrowhead). These data demonstrate that HAS2 and HAS3 isoforms interact and form heteromeric complexes. The functionality of the transfected 6myc-HAS2 and Flag-HAS3, as well as combinations thereof, was confirmed by the production of hyaluronan in the conditioned media (Fig. 2, A and B). Because monoubiquitination of proteins is characterized by about an 8-kDa mobility shift on SDS-PAGE, we hypothesized that the slower migrating components of apparent molecular masses of 5–8 kDa higher than the monomeric HAS2 isoforms (denoted with open arrowheads, FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2) could reflect monoubiquitination of Flag-HAS2 (58 kDa) and 6myc-HAS2 (74 kDa). As shown in Fig. 3A, MALDI-TOF analyses of the 65 and 74 kDa bands of the silver-stained species indicated that they were both derived from HAS2 (minimum sequence coverage of 30%). Furthermore, the peptide mass lists were scanned for the addition of GG or LRGG (the C-terminal tryptic peptides of ubiquitin) onto lysine residues in HAS2. A peptide of mass 1984.014 Da was found in the 74 kDa form, but not in the 65 kDa form, suggesting that the peptide 187-WGGK*REVMYTAFR-199, was ubiquitinated at Lys-190 (K190; indicated by an asterisk); the presence of the bulky Ub on Lys-190 may explain why trypsin did not cleave after Lys-190 or Arg-191 during the digestion of 6myc-HAS2. Monoubiquitination on Lys-190 could also be determined in another cell type, i.e. CHO cells stably transfected with 6myc-HAS2, that exhibits a hyaluronan-synthesizing capacity of about 0.3 μg of hyaluronan per 100 μg of protein (supplemental Fig. S2). To investigate further the ubiquitination of HAS2, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with 6myc- or Flag- HAS2 and HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub wt) (Fig. 3B). Smeary bands were detected by immunoblotting with HA antibodies from 6myc-HAS2 or Flag-HAS2 immunoprecipitates, indicating that HAS2 is post-translationally modified by polyubiquitin molecules, in addition to monoubiquitination (denoted with open arrowheads). We then investigated whether the polyubiquitin chains on the HAS2 protein were linked at Lys-48 and/or Lys-63 of ubiquitin, by comparing the incorporation into HAS2 of wt ubiquitin (HA-Ub wt), and K48R (HA-Ub K48R) or K63R (HA-Ub K63R) point mutants of Ub. Immunoprecipitation of transfected HAS2 followed by immunoblotting by the antibody P4D1 which recognizes both poly- and monoubiquitinated protein and an anti-HA antibody revealed strong smeary bands after transfection of wt HA-Ub, as well as K48R and K63R mutant ubiquitin (Fig. 4A). Altogether, these results suggest that HAS2 molecules are modified with polyubiquitin chains linked to both Lys-48 and Lys-63 residues. Because Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination is linked to protein turnover by targeting for degradation in proteasomes, we evaluated the physiological importance of polyubiquitination for the proteasomal degradation of HAS2. As shown in Fig. 4B, ectopic overexpression of Flag- and 6myc-HAS2 in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 increased slightly the pool of polyubiquitinated HAS2, as determined by the anti-ubiquitin antibody P4D1. Notably, blocking of proteasome-mediated degradation did not significantly affect the expression levels of Flag- and 6myc-HAS2 proteins, nor either their hyaluronan-synthesizing capacity (Fig. 4B), suggesting that only a minor pool of HAS2 were polyubiquitinated, possibly reflecting not properly folded molecules. To verify that HAS2 is monoubiquitinated on Lys-190, we created tagged HAS2 K190R point mutants. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with HA-Ub along with Flag- and 6myc-HAS2, as well as Flag- and 6myc-HAS2 K190R mutants. The cells were then lysed, followed by immunoprecipitation by Flag or Myc antibodies; samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with antibodies to Myc or Flag. A slower migrating species of tagged wt HAS2 were seen in the presence of HA-Ub wt (open arrowheads, Fig. 5A); however, such bands were less evident upon ectopic expression of the Flag- or 6myc-HAS2 K190R mutants. These findings verified that Lys-190 is a major, although not the only, ubiquitinated site. The size of the modified HAS2 molecule suggests that Lys-190 is monoubiquitinated, but we cannot exclude the possibility that it is also poly- and/or multiubiquitinated. Monoubiquitination has been demonstrated to regulate localization and activity of certain proteins by proteasome-independent cellular processes (34Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 35Leithe E. Rivedal E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50089-50096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To explore the physiological role of Lys-190 monoubiquitination of the HAS2 protein and its possible importance for HAS2 activity, we investigated the hyaluronan-synthesizing capacity of HAS2 K190R mutants in comparison to wt HAS2. Whereas overexpression of 6myc-HAS2 or Flag-HAS2 induced higher levels of hyaluronan production compared with mock transfectants, overexpression of the corresponding K190R HAS2 mutants did not induce any hyaluronan production (Fig. 5B), suggesting that monoubiquitination of HAS2 at Lys-190 is important for the enzymatic activity of HAS2. We then examined the role of Lys-190 monoubiquitination for the formation of oligomeric HAS2 structures. Immunoprecipitation with antibodies against Flag, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibodies, revealed heterodimers or oligomers between wt HAS2 and HAS2 K190R mutant molecules (Fig. 6A; thin arrows), as well as homomeric complexes of wt or K190R mutant HAS2 molecules (Fig. 6A). Thus, monoubiquitination is not necessary for dimerization of HAS2. Importantly, analysis of the hyaluronan content in the conditioned media of COS-1 cells co-transfected with equal amounts of HAS2 wt and K190R mutant constructs, revealed slightly lower levels of hyaluronan compared with conditioned medium of COS-1 cells transfected with wt HAS2 (Fig. 6B). To evaluate further the functional significance of monoubiquitination of HAS2 at the Lys-190 residue, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with wt HAS2 and increasing concentrations of the HAS2 K190R mutant (Fig. 7). COS-1 cells transfected with wt Flag or HA-tagged HAS2 synthesized hyaluronan whereas Flag-HAS2K190R mutants did not exhibit any detectable hyaluronan-synthesizing capacity. Expression of increasing amounts of the K190R mutant HAS2 molecule gradually decreased the synthesis of hyaluronan (Fig. 7). Because wt and K190R mutant HAS2 form dimers, these results suggest that the functional form of HAS2 is a dimer and that monoubiquitination of Lys-190 is crucial for the activity of HAS2 in the dimer. In addition, overexpression of wt HA-Ub did not significantly decrease the HAS2-induced hyaluronan production, suggesting that HAS2 ubiquitination at other sites than Lys-190 does not regulate HAS2 hyaluronan synthesizing activity and does not interfere with the structural organization of the oligomeric forms. We show in the present report that HAS2 forms dimers or oligomers, and that HAS2 activity is regulated by ubiquitination. HAS2 dimerization or oligomerization was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of differentially tagged HAS2 molecules. Interestingly, HAS2 oligomers could be detected in SDS-PAGE gels after extraction in TBS/Ca2+ buffer, supplemented with 0.1% SDS and 0.4% Nonidet P-40, or with the mild non-anionic detergent digitonin (supplemental Fig. S1), but also after extraction in TBS/Ca2+ buffer supplemented with 1% SDS (Fig. 1). Evidence for SDS-resistant HAS2 dimers in CHO cells stably transfected by HAS2 was also obtained (data not shown). Thus, the dimers are kept together by strong interactions. In a recent study it was demonstrated that HAS1 forms multimers through intermolecular disulfide bonds (36Ghosh A. Kuppusamy H. Pilarski L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18840-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the HAS2 dimers we observed were seen both in the presence and absence of reducing agents, making it unlikely that disulfide bonds are involved. The nature of the bonds that keep the SDS-resistant HAS2 dimers together remains to be elucidated. The observation of a dimeric structure of HAS2 is consistent with our earlier findings that the HAS activity may reside in a large protein complex (37Asplund T. Brinck J. Suzuki M. Briskin M.J. Heldin P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1380: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An indication that HAS2 dimerization may be of functional importance came from the other finding of our study, i.e. our demonstration that HAS2 is ubiquitinated. We identified one acceptor site for ubiquitination, i.e. Lys-190 (Table 1), in transiently transfected COS cells (Fig. 3A) and in stably transfected CHO cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Interestingly, mutation of this residue led to inactivation of the enzymatic activity of HAS2. Moreover, the K190R mutant HAS2 was shown to dimerize with wt HAS2, and suppressed the activity of wt HAS2 in such dimers. Our data suggest that monoubiquitination of Lys-190 of both HAS2 subunits are necessary for activity. Another conclusion from the observation that K190R mutant HAS2 can inhibit the activity of HAS2 is that a dimeric, or possibly oligomeric, structure of HAS2 is necessary for its function. The reason for the need for dimerization or oligomerization of HAS2 for its activity remains to be elucidated. It should be noted, however, that hyaluronan is secreted through the plasma membrane in conjunction with its synthesis and that HAS isoforms are rather small transmembrane proteins; possibly more than one HAS molecule is needed to form a pore through which hyaluronan is extruded. Notably, there are indications that phospholipids, such as cardiolipin, are required for Streptococcus pyogenes HAS activity (38Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 39Weigel P.H. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36777-36781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It is possible that the activity of mammalian HAS can also be affected by the lipids in the plasma membrane. Furthermore, it has been reported that an ABC transporter system is involved in the transport of hyaluronan to the extracellular space (40Prehm P. Schumacher U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 41Schulz T. Schumacher U. Prehm P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20999-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the activities of mammalian enzymes and the amounts of hyaluronan synthesized, are affected by the oligomeric state of HAS molecules, monoubiquitination, ABC transport systems, and phospholipid microenvironment. Another interesting question for future studies is to elucidate the exact role of ubiquitination for HAS2 function. It is possible that ubiquitination of Lys-190 is needed for the docking of the substrates required for hyaluronan synthesis, or for the actual catalysis. Noteworthy, Lys190 is located in the HAS2 glycosyltransferase-2 conserved domain. Significantly, amino acid sequence alignment between vertebrate HASs within the glycosyltransferase region, shows that Lys-190 is conserved among all other HAS isoforms, suggesting that it may have a key role for the function of HAS (42Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some ubiquitination remained in the K190R mutant, suggesting that there are also other sites of ubiquitination in HAS2, the function of which remains to be determined.

Sub-Saharan Africa is the region that is affected the most. In this region, women account for ∼60% of all HIV-1 infections (44Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic. UNAIDS, Geneva, Switzerland2008Google Scholar). Today’s prevention options (condoms, mutual monogamy, and sexually transmitted disease treatment) are not feasible for millions of people around the world, especially for women. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of other prevention methods so that women have opportunities to protect themselves. Microbicides are self-administering prophylactic agents, impeding transmission of HIV-1 or other sexually transmitted diseases. HIV-1 transmission can be defined by virus crossing the epithelial barrier and productively infecting a CD4+ target cell. The entry of HIV-1 into its target cell is mediated by the glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, which are present on the viral envelope. These glycoproteins bind first to the cellular receptor CD4 and then to a so-called HIV co-receptor, CCR5 and/or CXCR4. Both gp120 and gp41 are heavily glycosylated proteins (1Leonard C.K.

Recently, microvirin (MVN) was discovered as a novel lectin from the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806 and shows 33% identity at the amino acid level with CV-N (24Kehr J.C. Zilliges Y.

MVN has a molecular mass of 14.3 kDa and shows high specificity for high mannose structures containing terminal Manα(1–2)Manα moieties (24Kehr J.C. Zilliges Y. Springer A. Disney M.D. Ratner D.D.

CV-N (11 kDa) was a kind gift from Dr. C. A. Bewley (17Bewley C.A. Otero-Quintero S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3892-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Batches of the stock solutions of MVN and CV-N were tested for endotoxin content with the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay (Cambrex Bioscience, Verviers, Belgium), and at the highest concentrations tested, the stock solutions were found to contain less than 1 ng/ml endotoxin. The plant lectins GNA (50 kDa), HHA (50 kDa), and UDA (8.5 kDa) were kindly provided by Dr. E. Van Damme (University Ghent, Belgium). Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (128 kDa) was purchased from Sigma. Pradimicin S (PRM-S) (910 Da) was produced by the strain Actinomadura sp. TP-A0020 and isolated and purified from the culture supernatants as described previously (25Saitoh K. Tenmyo O. Yamamoto S.

The mAbs labeled with phycoerythrin or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) used were CD25, CD69, HLA-DR, and CD4 and were purchased from BD Biosciences (Erembodegem, Belgium). The rabbit anti-human IgG-FITC was purchased from DakoCytomation. The MT-4 T cell line was a kind gift of Dr. L. Montagnier (at that time at the Pasteur Institute (Paris, France)), and the Raji/DC-SIGN+ B cells were kindly provided by Dr. L. Burleigh (Pasteur Institute). Human T-lymphocytic C8166, HUT-78, and SupT1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cell lines were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWittaker Europe, Verviers, Belgium) and 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified CO2-controlled atmosphere. Buffy coat preparations from healthy donors were obtained from the Blood Transfusion Center (Leuven, Belgium). PBMCs were cultured in cell culture medium (RPMI 1640) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine or were activated with PHA (2 μg/ml) for 3 days and cultured in cell culture medium in the presence of 2 ng/ml interleukin (IL)-2 (Roche Applied Science). HIV-1 NL4.3 (X4), IIIB (X4), and BaL (R5) were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health). HIV-1 HE (R5/X4) was isolated from a Belgian AIDS patient in 1987 (27Pauwels R. Andries K. Desmyter J. Schols D. Kukla M.J. Breslin H.J. Raeymaeckers A. Van Gelder J. Woestenborghs R. Heykants J. Nature. 1990; 343: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Primary clinical isolates representing different HIV-1 clades and a HIV-2 isolate were all kindly provided by Dr. L. Lathey from BBI Biotech Research Laboratories, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD), and their coreceptor use (R5 of X4) was determined in our laboratory in the astroglioma U87.CD4 cell line transfected with either CCR5 (U87.CD4.CCR5) or CXCR4 (U87.CD4.CXCR4). The HIV-1 NL4.3 strain was made resistant to 2G12 mAb as described previously (28Huskens D. Van Laethem K. Vermeire K. Balzarini J. Schols D. Virology. 2007; 360: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). MT-4 cells were infected with the X4 HIV-1 strain NL4.3. Briefly, 5-fold dilutions of the compounds were added to 96-well flat-bottomed plates (International Medical, Brussels, Belgium). Then, to each well, 7.5 × 104 MT-4 cells were added, and the cells were infected with ∼100 tissue culture infective dose 50% (TCID50) of the viruses HIV-1 NL4.3, NL4.3 2G12-res, and NL4.3 MVN-res. Cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by the virus was checked microscopically at regular times. When strong CPE was observed in untreated HIV-infected cells (mostly after 4 or 5 days of culture), the cell viability was assessed spectrophotometrically via the in situ reduction of the tetrazolium dye MTS, using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI). The absorbance was then recorded at 490 nm with a 96-well plate reader and compared with four cell control wells (cells without virus and drugs) and four virus control wells (cells with virus but without drugs). The IC50 (the concentration that inhibited HIV-1-induced cell death by 50%) was calculated from each dose-response curve. The CC50 (50% cytotoxic concentration) of compounds was determined from the reduction of viability of uninfected MT-4 cells exposed to the compounds, as measured by the MTS method described above. PHA-stimulated blasts were seeded at 0.5 × 106 cells/well into a 48-well plate containing varying concentrations of compound in medium containing IL-2. The virus stocks were added at a final dose of ∼100 TCID50 of HIV-1, HIV-2, or SIV. Cell supernatant was collected at days 9–12, and HIV-1 core antigen (Ag) in the culture supernatant was analyzed by a p24 Ag ELISA kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For HIV-2 and SIV p27 Ag, detection the INNOTEST from Innogenetics (Temse, Belgium) was used. Persistently HIV-1(IIIB)-infected HUT-78 cells (HUT-78/IIIB) were generated by infection of HUT-78 cells with HIV-1 IIIB. The cells were subcultured every 3–4 days, and persistent virus infection was monitored in the culture supernatants using HIV-1 p24 Ag ELISA. For the co-cultivation assay, different concentrations of the test compound along with 1 × 105 SupT1 cells/50 μl were added to 96-well plates. Then a similar amount of HUT-78/IIIB cells (50 μl) was added. After 1 day, the IC50 values were determined microscopically based on the appearance of giant cells or syncytia in the co-cultures. High amounts of HIV-1 HE (100 μl; ∼3.2 × 106 pg p24/ml) were exposed to serial dilutions of the test compounds (200 μl) for 30 min. Then, MVN-exposed virus suspensions were mixed with Raji/DC-SIGN cell suspensions (200 μl; 5 × 105 cells) for 1 h at 37 °C, after which the cells were thoroughly washed with culture medium. The Raji/DC-SIGN cell cultures were then analyzed for HIV-1 p24 Ag content by a p24 Ag ELISA kit. Raji/DC-SIGN cells were exposed to HIV-1 HE for 1 h at 37 °C and thoroughly washed. Various concentrations of the test compound (100 μl) were added in a 96-well plate, along with 1 × 105 C8166 CD4+ T cells (50 μl). Then a similar amount of HIV-1-exposed Raji/DC-SIGN cells were added, and giant cell formation was evaluated microscopically 20–24 h later. HIV-1 NL4.3 was added to MT-4 cells (0.4 × 106 cells/ml) in 24-well plates in the presence of 40 ng/ml MVN. Every 5 days, the replicating virus was passaged in fresh uninfected cells in the presence of MVN at the same concentration as in the previous passage or at a 2-fold higher concentration when extensive CPE was obtained in the previous cell culture. After 41 passages (∼205 days of culture), virus was recovered that was able to replicate in the presence of 700 nm MVN (HIV-1 NL4.3-MVN-res). The induced CPE and p24 Ag production level of this virus was comparable with that of the wild-type NL4.3 virus (in the absence of MVN). Viral RNA was extracted from culture supernatants using the QIAamp Viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The genotyping of both the gp120 and gp41 genes was determined in this assay as described before (29Van Laethem K. Schrooten Y. Lemey P. Van Wijngaerden E. De Wit S. Van Ranst M. Vandamme A.M. J. Virol. Methods. 2005; 123: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MT-4 cells were infected with NL4.3 wild-type and NL4.3-MVN-res virus and analyzed when CPE started to occur (3–4 days after infection). Briefly, after washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum, cells were preincubated with or without MVN or CV-N at different concentrations for 30 min, washed, and then incubated with 2G12 mAb or b12 mAb for 30 min at 4 °C. Then the cells were washed and incubated with rabbit anti-human IgG-FITC for 30 min at 4 °C. As a control for aspecific background staining, cells were stained in parallel with rabbit anti-human IgG-FITC only. Then the cells were washed and fixed with 1% aqueous formaldehyde solution, and data were acquired with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with FLOWJO software (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA). For the calculations of the mAb binding, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each sample was expressed as a percentage of the MFI of control cells (after subtracting the MFI of the background staining). Finally, the IC50 values of the compounds were calculated. The expression of cellular activation markers was measured after a 3-day incubation of PBMCs with varying concentrations of MVN or CV-N at 37 °C. Briefly, after washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb in combination with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD25, anti-CD69, or anti-HLA-DR mAbs for 30 min at 4 °C. For aspecific background staining, cells were stained in parallel with Simultest Control IgG γ1/γ2a (BD Biosciences). Finally, the cells were washed, fixed with 1% formaldehyde solution, and analyzed with a FACSCalibur, and data were acquired with CellQuest software and analyzed with FLOWJO software. PBMCs were cultured in the presence of several concentrations of MVN and CV-N, and culture supernatant was collected after 72 h. The cytokine production profile was determined by the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad) and Bio-Plex Human Cytokine 27-plex assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 27-plex assay kit contains beads conjugated with mAbs specific for IL-1α, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, eotaxin, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), IP-10 (interferon-inducible protein-10), MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), MIP-1α (macrophage inflammatory protein-1α), MIP-1β, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). For each cytokine, nine standards ranging from 0.5 pg/ml to 32,000 pg/ml were constructed, and the minimum detectable dose was between 0.5 and 5 pg/ml. Standard curves and the concentrations of the cytokines within the samples were generated with Bio-Plex Manager 4.1 software. Freshly isolated PBMCs were cultured in the presence of MVN, CV-N, HHA, and PHA for 24 h. Then the cells were collected, washed in culture medium, suspended in RPMI medium with 2 ng/ml IL-2, and seeded in a 48-well flat bottom plate (5 × 105 cells in 450 μl), and 50 μl of the CCR5-tropic clade B HIV-1 BaL stock was added at ∼100 TCID50. The supernatant of each sample was collected after 7 days, and viral replication was measured by p24 Ag ELISA. Statistical analysis performed on the results included the calculation of the mean, S.E., and p values by use of Student's t test. The significance level was set as p = 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 5 statistical software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The anti-HIV activity of the new mannose-specific CBA MVN was compared with that of the other mannose-specific CBAs CV-N, HHA, and 2G12 mAb (Table 1). MVN was evaluated in PBMCs against a wide variety of HIV-1 clades and showed antiviral activity against all HIV-1 group M clades with IC50 values ranging between 2.1 and 167 nm. In fact, MVN was more active than CV-N against HIV-1 isolates A and B but was 10-fold less active against a clade C isolate. Apparently, MVN exerted no activity against HIV-1 group O, HIV-2 (Table 1), and SIVmac251 (data not shown). In addition, MVN proved to be equally active against laboratory-adapted strains irrespective of their co-receptor use as evidenced by the comparable IC50 values for X4 NL4.3 and R5 BaL (Table 1). In addition, MVN showed generally a better anti-HIV-1 activity profile than HHA. This is in sharp contrast with the data of the 2G12 mAb, which is active against a limited set of isolates (mainly clade A and B) (Table 1), as is also described by others (30West Jr., A.P. Galimidi R.P. Foglesong C.P. Gnanapragasam P.N. Huey-Tubman K.E. Klein J.S. Suzuki M.D. Tiangco N.E. Vielmetter J. Bjorkman P.J. J.

Open table in a new tab Next, the cytotoxicity of MVN was evaluated because this can be a major concern for practical use of the CBAs, since cytotoxicity was observed for CV-N (CC50 of 191 nm and 900 nm in MT-4 cells and PBMCs, respectively) (19Balzarini J. Van Laethem K. Peumans W.J. Van Damme E.J. Bolmstedt A. Gago F. Schols D. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 8411-8421Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Huskens D. Vermeire K. Vandemeulebroucke E. Balzarini J. Schols D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 2802-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, we could not observe any toxic effect of MVN in MT-4 cells (CC50 > 35 μm) and PBMCs (CC50 > 7 μm). In this set of experiments, the antiviral activity of MVN against a series of NL4.3 virus inputs starting at ∼100 TCID50 (normally used in our experiments) up to 5000 TCID50 was evaluated and compared with the activity of the 2G12 mAb. MVN remained active with slightly increasing IC50 values of 9.0, 29.5, 27.3, 42.6, and 41.5 nm for virus inputs of 100, 500, 1000, 2500, and 5000 TCID50, respectively. Also for HHA, slightly increasing IC50 values of 0.6, 2.3, 3.1, 3.0, and 8.7 nm for virus inputs of 100, 500, 1000, 2500, and 5000 TCID50, respectively, were observed. In contrast, for the 2G12 mAb, there was a strong dose-dependent loss of activity with IC50 values of 0.56, 2.4, and 3.5 μg/ml for virus inputs of 100, 500, and 1000 TCID50, and at 2500 and 5000 TCID50, 2G12 mAb was completely inactive (IC50 > 20 μg/ml). Because the CBAs are known to bind to gp120, we investigated whether MVN could prevent virus-cell contact and fusion. Therefore, the inhibitory activity against syncytium (giant cell) formation between persistently HIV-1-infected HUT-78 T cells and uninfected CD4+ SupT1 cells was determined for MVN. As shown in Fig. 1, MVN dose-dependently inhibited syncytium formation (124 nm ± 38 nm, n = 2). A possible HIV mucosal infection pathway is the transmission of DC-SIGN captured virus to CD4+ T cells. We investigated the potential of MVN to prevent capture of the HIV-1 strain HE (R5/X4) by DC-SIGN using Raji cells transfected with DC-SIGN (31Geijtenbeek T.B. Kwon D.S. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C. Middel J. Cornelissen I.L. Nottet H.S. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y.

Short exposure of these cells to HIV-1 results in a significant capture of virus to their cell membrane (32Balzarini J. Van Herrewege Y. Vermeire K. Vanham G. Schols D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Initially, HIV-1 was pre-exposed to MVN for 30 min before the virus was administered to the Raji/DC-SIGN cells. After 1 h, free virus and MVN were carefully removed"
https://openalex.org/W2058553583,"Background Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common, lethal disease of childhood. One of 3500 new-born males suffers from this universally-lethal disease. Other than the use of corticosteroids, little is available to affect the relentless progress of the disease, leading many families to use dietary supplements in hopes of reducing the progression or severity of muscle wasting. Arginine is commonly used as a dietary supplement and its use has been reported to have beneficial effects following short-term administration to mdx mice, a genetic model of DMD. However, the long-term effects of arginine supplementation are unknown. This lack of knowledge about the long-term effects of increased arginine metabolism is important because elevated arginine metabolism can increase tissue fibrosis, and increased fibrosis of skeletal muscles and the heart is an important and potentially life-threatening feature of DMD. Methodology We use both genetic and nutritional manipulations to test whether changes in arginase metabolism promote fibrosis and increase pathology in mdx mice. Our findings show that fibrotic lesions in mdx muscle are enriched with arginase-2-expressing macrophages and that muscle macrophages stimulated with cytokines that activate the M2 phenotype show elevated arginase activity and expression. We generated a line of arginase-2-null mutant mdx mice and found that the mutation reduced fibrosis in muscles of 18-month-old mdx mice, and reduced kyphosis that is attributable to muscle fibrosis. We also observed that dietary supplementation with arginine for 17-months increased mdx muscle fibrosis. In contrast, arginine-2 mutation did not reduce cardiac fibrosis or affect cardiac function assessed by echocardiography, although 17-months of dietary supplementation with arginine increased cardiac fibrosis. Long-term arginine treatments did not decrease matrix metalloproteinase-2 or -9 or increase the expression of utrophin, which have been reported as beneficial effects of short-term treatments. Conclusions/Significance Our findings demonstrate that arginine metabolism by arginase promotes fibrosis of muscle in muscular dystrophy and contributes to kyphosis. Our findings also show that long-term, dietary supplementation with arginine exacerbates fibrosis of dystrophic heart and muscles. Thus, commonly-practiced dietary supplementation with arginine by DMD patients has potential risk for increasing pathology when performed for long periods, despite reports of benefits acquired with short-term supplementation."
https://openalex.org/W2059473902,"Cyclic AMP synthesized by Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been shown to play a role in pathogenesis. However, the high levels of intracellular cAMP found in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacteria suggest that additional and important biological processes are regulated by cAMP in these organisms. We describe here the biochemical characterization of novel cAMP-binding proteins in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis (MSMEG_5458 and Rv0998, respectively) that contain a cyclic nucleotide binding domain fused to a domain that shows similarity to the GNAT family of acetyltransferases. We detect protein lysine acetylation in mycobacteria and identify a universal stress protein (USP) as a substrate of MSMEG_5458. Acetylation of a lysine residue in USP is regulated by cAMP, and using a strain deleted for MSMEG_5458, we show that USP is indeed an in vivo substrate for MSMEG_5458. The Rv0998 protein shows a strict cAMP-dependent acetylation of USP, despite a lower affinity for cAMP than MSMEG_5458. Thus, this report not only represents the first demonstration of protein lysine acetylation in mycobacteria but also describes a unique functional interplay between a cyclic nucleotide binding domain and a protein acetyltransferase.

IntroductionCyclic AMP is used as a signal for eliciting diverse cellular responses in both bacteria and higher eukaryotes. Nucleotide cyclases utilize ATP and GTP to make cAMP or cGMP, respectively, and of the six classes of nucleotide cyclases that have been described (1Barzu O. Danchin A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

The genomes of pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis that accounts for almost 2 million deaths annually worldwide, harbor a number of genes that encode putative Class III nucleotide cyclases (3Shenoy A.R.

Biol. 2007; 365: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Most recently, it has been reported that cAMP production by the Rv0386 adenylyl cyclase is critical for allowing M. tuberculosis to establish itself within the mammalian host and cause disease (7Agarwal N. Lamichhane G. Gupta R. Nolan S. Bishai W.R. Nature. 2009; 460: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the production, utilization, and degradation of cAMP by M. tuberculosis may provide avenues for the identification of novel targets for drug development (8Shenoy A.R. Visweswariah S.S. Trends Microbiol. 2006; 14: 543-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).The genomes of non-pathogenic mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium smegmatis, also encode multiple nucleotide cyclase genes, which could account for the high intracellular cAMP levels found in these bacteria (9Dass B.K. Sharma R. Shenoy A.R. Mattoo R. Visweswariah S.S. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3824-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). cAMP levels are modulated by various stress conditions in M. smegmatis (9Dass B.K. Sharma R. Shenoy A.R. Mattoo R. Visweswariah S.S. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3824-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that cAMP participates in signaling within the bacterial cell, mediating its action by downstream effectors. The effectors of cAMP in mammalian cells have been well characterized and include protein kinase A (PKA), 4The abbreviations used are: PKAprotein kinase A2-ME2-mercaptoethanolCREBcAMP response element-bindingCBPCREB-binding proteincNMPcyclic nucleotide monophosphateCRPcatabolite repressor proteinDTTdithiothreitolGSTglutathione S-transferaseMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time of flightUSPuniversal stress proteinBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol(Sp)-cAMPSadenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Sp isomer. exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC), and the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (10Berman H.M.

Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The cyclic nucleotide (cNMP) binding domain in these proteins is conserved evolutionarily, and the best characterized protein with a cAMP binding domain in bacteria is the catabolite repressor protein, or CRP, that serves as a transcription factor, either enhancing or repressing transcription of a variety of genes in a cAMP-dependent manner (12Körner H. Sofia H.J. Zumft W.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 559-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 13Gallagher D.T. Smith N. Kim S.K. Robinson H. Reddy P.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2010; 285: 7016-7027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Binding of cAMP allosterically regulates the activity of these effector proteins.Apart from CRP, no other downstream effector of cAMP in mycobacteria has been described. In this study we provide evidence for an entirely new signaling event mediated by cAMP and so far exclusive to mycobacteria. We show that the products of the Rv0998 gene and its ortholog in M. smegmatis, MSMEG_5458, are cNMP-binding proteins that share a significant similarity to the regulatory subunit of mammalian PKA. Remarkably, the cNMP domain in these proteins is fused to, and regulates the activity of, a GNAT-like protein acetyltransferase, which acetylates the epsilon amino group of a lysine residue in a Universal Stress Protein (USP, MSMEG_4207). This represents not only the first report of lysine acetylation in mycobacteria but also a novel effector function of cAMP in mycobacteria, which is perhaps reflective of the more complex cAMP/PKA/CREB/CBP pathway seen in eukaryotes (15Wang L. Tang Y. Cole P.A. Marmorstein R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe importance of cAMP in regulating biological processes has been conserved throughout evolution. What remains unique are downstream effectors coupled to cAMP. We now have identified a novel mechanism utilized by mycobacteria to potentially modify protein acetylation in a cAMP-responsive way.Our study represents the first biochemical characterization of proteins containing a fusion of a GNAT-like domain with a cNMP domain, and provides a novel downstream effector function of cyclic nucleotides in mycobacteria. Such a fusion was not identified in an earlier analysis of the evolution of cNMP binding modules in both eukaryotes, and prokaryotic genome sequences obtained from Global Ocean Sampling (34Kannan N. Wu J. Anand G.S. Yooseph S. Neuwald A.F. Venter J.C. Taylor S.S. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R264Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), perhaps indicating that this domain fusion may be unique to mycobacteria.In a phylogenetic analysis, MSMEG_5458 clusters with bacterial and fungal proteins, and based on a classification of the phosphate binding cassette, has residues that group it with fungal and alveolate regulatory subunits (35Canaves J.M. Taylor S.S. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The presence of a Ser/Thr residue at position 14 in the phosphate binding cassette (Ser-99 in Rv0998 and Thr-96 in MSMEG_5458) explains the observation that MSMEG_5458 binds to and is also regulated by cGMP (36Weber I.T. Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6122-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Whether cGMP has a physiological role in mycobacteria is uncertain, because the nucleotide cyclases encoded in mycobacterial genomes are predicted to be adenylyl cyclases, although some purified enzymes show low guanylyl cyclase activity (3Shenoy A.R. Visweswariah S.S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3344-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The affinity of cAMP for MSMEG_5458 is in the range reported for the isolated A and B domains in the regulatory subunit of PKA (26Dostmann W.R. Taylor S.S. Genieser H.G. Jastorff B. Døskeland S.O. Ogreid D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10484-10491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the high (∼100 μm to 1 mm) concentrations of intracellular cAMP in M. smegmatis (9Dass B.K. Sharma R. Shenoy A.R. Mattoo R. Visweswariah S.S. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3824-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it is possible that MSMEG_5458 would almost always be completely saturated with cAMP. During evolution, this may have resulted in the production of a protein that shows only a 3-fold increase in substrate acetylation in the presence of cAMP. However, the very low acetyltransferase activity of Rv0998 in the absence of cAMP, and a dramatic increase in the presence, of cAMP, suggests that Rv0998 can be more tuned to the intracellular levels of cAMP and can modulate the levels of protein acetylation in the cell more precisely. It is conceivable that the actual rate of acetylation in vivo could be markedly different to that seen in vitro and could also be distinct for the two species.A number of proteins containing acetyltransferase domains are found encoded in mycobacteria (37Vagena E. Fakis G. Boukouvala S. Curr. Drug Metab. 2008; 9: 628-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and some have been characterized. For example, arylamine N-acetyltransferases, which catalyze the transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the free amino group of arylamines and hydrazines, can acetylate the antitubercular drug isoniazid, thus possibly preventing activation of the prodrug in the mycobacterial cell (28Sim E. Sandy J. Evangelopoulos D. Fullam E. Bhakta S. Westwood I. Krylova A. Lack N. Noble M. Curr. Drug Metab. 2008; 9: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Rv0802c exhibits the GNAT fold, and co-crystallization with succinyl-CoA suggested its preferential use as a substrate (38Vetting M.W. Errey J.C. Blanchard J.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 978-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have observed that MSMEG_5458 could utilize butyryl-CoA as the substrate for acetylation of USP while the activity with succinyl-CoA was much lower. Some GNAT-like enzymes can acetylate proteins (usually histones are used as model substrates) as well as low molecular aminoglycosides (39Vetting M.W. Magnet S. Nieves E. Roderick S.L. Blanchard J.S. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 565-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that MSMEG_5458 and Rv0998 could have non-proteinaceous substrates in mycobacteria, although both these proteins were inactive against aminoglycoside antibiotics in our assays. It may also be worth testing if newly described mycobacterial aminoglycoside acetyltransferases such as eis could acetylate proteins in addition to kanamycin (40Zaunbrecher M.A. Sikes Jr., R.D. Metchock B. Shinnick T.M. Posey J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20004-20009Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), especially because a number of proteins appear to be acetylated in a MSMEG_5458-independent manner in M. smegmatis.It is intriguing that the Glu-234 → Ala mutation in MSMEG_5458 reduced basal activity of the enzyme, but in the presence of cAMP, significant acetylation of USP was observed (Fig. 5C). In a recent study on the structure of the protein acetyltransferase from Sulfolobus, it was speculated that the process of inserting the lysine residue in a hydrophobic, substrate-binding pocket seen in protein acetyltransferase could significantly alter the pKa of the lysine residue, thereby allowing acetylation to proceed (41Brent M.M. Iwata A. Carten J. Zhao K. Marmorstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 19412-19419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Perhaps a similar mechanism is seen in MSMEG_5458 whereby cAMP binding could alter the hydrophobicity of the substrate binding site, thereby reducing the pKa of the lysine sufficiently to allow the acetylation reaction to occur, without the requirement of the Glu-234 residue to serve as a base (42Mehler E.L. Fuxreiter M. Simon I. Garcia-Moreno E.B. Proteins. 2002; 48: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).The tight association of USP with MSMEG_5458 is surprising, because enzyme-substrate complexes are rarely identified by pulldown assay approaches in the absence of an inhibitor. Perhaps this is indicative of USP being a good substrate for MSMEG_5458, with a high affinity for the enzyme (supplemental Fig. S4). Indeed, USP may be in a stable complex with MSMEG_5458 in cells under steady-state conditions. As a corollary, tight binding of USP would preclude the binding of other substrates to MSMEG_5458, and thus USP may act as a regulator of protein acetylation brought about by MSMEG_5458.In bacteria as well as eukaryotes, a number of enzymes involved in central metabolic pathways have recently been shown to be acetylated (43Wang Q. Zhang Y. Yang C. Xiong H. Lin Y. Yao J. Li H. Xie L. Zhao W. Yao Y. Ning Z.B. Zeng R. Xiong Y. Guan K.L. Zhao S. Zhao G.P. Science. 2010; 327: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 44Zhao S. Xu W. Jiang W. Yu W. Lin Y. Zhang T. Yao J. Zhou L. Zeng Y. Li H. Li Y. Shi J. An W. Hancock S.M. He F. Qin L. Chin J. Yang P. Chen X. Lei Q. Xiong Y. Guan K.L. Science. 2010; 327: 1000-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar), suggesting a conserved means of regulation of intermediary metabolism. Protein acetylation in eukaryotes also regulates DNA-binding activity, protein-protein interaction, and protein stability via ubiquitination (45Yang X.J. Seto E. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, there are reports of acetylation of the response regulator CheY (46Yan J. Barak R. Liarzi O. Shainskaya A. Eisenbach M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 376: 1260-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and acetyl-CoA synthetase (47Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Science. 2002; 298: 2390-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Indeed, Sulfolobus, an entire machinery for protein acetylation and deacetylation, has been described involving a Sir2-like deacetylase, the acetyltransferase protein acetyltransferase, and its substrate Alba, which is an acetylation-regulated DNA-binding protein (48Marsh V.L. Peak-Chew S.Y. Bell S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21122-21128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 49Bell S.D. Botting C.H. Wardleworth B.N. Jackson S.P. White M.F. Science. 2002; 296: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). A global analysis of acetylated proteins in E. coli showed that a large number are metabolic enzymes, transcriptional/translational regulators, and stress response proteins (50Zhang J. Sprung R. Pei J. Tan X. Kim S. Zhu H. Liu C.F. Grishin N.V. Zhao Y. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2009; 8: 215-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Such a proteome-wide study has not been performed in mycobacteria. Recent reports on pupylation, as a modification that occurs on lysine residues in mycobacterial proteins and regulates their stability (51Pearce M.J. Mintseris J. Ferreyra J. Gygi S.P. Darwin K.H. Science. 2008; 322: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 52Festa R.A. McAllister F. Pearce M.J. Mintseris J. Burns K.E. Gygi S.P. Darwin K.H. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggest that a competition between acetylation and pupylation may occur on specific lysine residues in proteins as a means of regulating their stability within the cell. This of course would occur only if the sites of pupylation and acetylation overlap, and such studies would be of interest to pursue.MSMEG_5458 is not an essential gene, but orthologs are conserved in all mycobacteria, suggesting a unique requirement for this protein product, perhaps under environmental conditions that are not achieved in laboratory cultures of M. smegmatis. Acetyl-CoA and NAD (or the NAD:NADH ratio) are key indicators of cellular energy status, and the requirement of acetyl-CoA for acetyltransferases and NAD for sirtuin-like enzymes indicates that protein lysine acetylation serves as a link that connects cellular energy levels with protein acetylation/deacetylation activity (53Yu J. Auwerx J. Pharmacol. Res. 2010; 62: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In mycobacteria, a third player has a role to play, and that is cAMP. Intracellular cAMP levels if altered under certain conditions could modulate the effects brought about by the energy status of the cell and thereby regulate protein acetylation. The challenge ahead is to identify all acetylated proteins in mycobacteria and to determine how many of them are substrates for the Rv0998 family of proteins. Importantly, studies to elucidate the consequences of protein acetylation and deacetylation in the biology of these important bacteria are also required. IntroductionCyclic AMP is used as a signal for eliciting diverse cellular responses in both bacteria and higher eukaryotes. Nucleotide cyclases utilize ATP and GTP to make cAMP or cGMP, respectively, and of the six classes of nucleotide cyclases that have been described (1Barzu O. Danchin A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

The highly complex fibrillar fibronectin meshwork orchestrates the functions of other extracellular matrix proteins, promoting cell adhesion, migration, and intracellular signaling. Here, we demonstrate that CagL, a 26-kDa protein of the gastric pathogen and type I carcinogen Helicobacter pylori, mimics fibronectin in various cellular functions. Like fibronectin, CagL contains a RGD motif and is located on the surface of the bacterial type IV secretion pili as previously shown. CagL binds to the integrin receptor α5β1 and mediates the injection of virulence factors into host target cells. We show that purified CagL alone can directly trigger intracellular signaling pathways upon contact with mammalian cells and can complement the spreading defect of fibronectin−/− knock-out cells in vitro. During interaction with various human and mouse cell lines, CagL mimics fibronectin in triggering cell spreading, focal adhesion formation, and activation of several tyrosine kinases in an RGD-dependent manner. Among the activated factors are the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases focal adhesion kinase and Src but also the epidermal growth factor receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor family member Her3/ErbB3. Interestingly, fibronectin activates a similar range of tyrosine kinases but not Her3/ErbB3. These findings suggest that the bacterial protein CagL not only exhibits functional mimicry with fibronectin but is also capable of activating fibronectin-independent signaling events. We thus postulate that CagL may contribute directly to H. pylori pathogenesis by promoting aberrant signaling cross-talk within host cells.

The ECM is a meshwork of fibrillar and nonfibrillar components assembled into complex structures such as basement membranes. The latter provide a scaffold for cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. ECM regulates numerous cell functions by activating multiple signaling pathways at the adhesion sites. ECMs, composed of collagens, laminins, and other glycoproteins such as fibronectin (FN), serve as substrates for different adhesion molecules including the integrin family of transmembrane receptors. The assembly of ECM components into functional supramolecular modules is highly regulated (3.Humphries M.J. Travis M.A. Clark K. Mould A.P. Biochem. Soc.

FN matrix assembly alone is a dynamic cell-driven process in which the soluble FN molecules assemble into insoluble fibrillar polymeric ECM structures (8.Mao Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. Matrix Biol. 2005; 24: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar).FN and integrin receptors play crucial roles in a variety of morphogenetic processes, which are regulated by processes termed outside-in and inside-out signaling cascades (3.Humphries M.J.

Deregulation of integrin and FN functions associates with disease development including chronic inflammation, heart failure, cancer, and metastasis (7.Leiss M. Beckmann K. Girós A. Costell M.

The outside-in signaling triggered by ligation of integrin receptors with FN and other ECM components results in the reorganization of cytoskeletal and signaling molecules into complexes of more than 90 proteins (9.Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6764) Google Scholar, 10.Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). This occurs by synergistic processes dependent on integrin aggregation and occupancy, as well as tyrosine phosphorylation. Integrins also cooperate with growth factor receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to enhance signaling (14.Streuli C.H. Akhtar N. Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).FN consists of multiple domains (classified types I–III) that show binding specificities for specific cell membrane receptors, collagen, fibrin, and heparin. FN alone is sufficient to induce highly efficient spreading of many mammalian cell types including fibroblast and epithelial cells in vitro. An important functional unit of FN is its RGD tripeptide motif, which acts in synergy with a PHSRN sequence for binding to integrins. In particular, the RGD motif is crucial for mediating eukaryotic cell adhesion and spreading (3.Humphries M.J. Travis M.A. Clark K. Mould A.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7.Leiss M. Beckmann K. Girós A. Costell M. Fässler R. Curr. Opin.

Integrin-Ligand Interaction. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997Crossref Google Scholar). Remarkably, FN is no passive adhesive molecule but actively triggers signal transduction to the F-actin cytoskeleton and focal contact formation upon binding to integrins. Binding of FN to integrin α5β1 results in the recruitment of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src kinase and the subsequent activation of these kinases in the focal adhesion complexes (9.Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6764) Google Scholar, 10.Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar).Although ECM proteins are unique to the eukaryotic kingdom, many bacterial pathogens adhere to host ECM molecules or integrins to exploit the downstream signaling pathways for entering host cells or establishing persistent infection (17.Boyle E.C.

For example, the well characterized bacterial protein invasin (InvA) of Yersinia spp. has been shown to bind α5β1 and some other integrins in a manner similar to FN (21.Isberg R.R. Leong J.M. Cell. 1990; 60: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 22.Leong J.M. Fournier R.S. Isberg R.R.

Isberg R.R. Bjorkman P.J. Science. 1999; 286: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Immobilized membrane proteins of an InvA-overproducing Yersinia strain were observed to trigger spreading of HEp-2 cells. Although this effect of InvA was attributed to its ability to bind integrin β1, the molecular mechanisms involved have not been investigated in full detail (25.Isberg R.R. Leong J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that the gastric pathogen and type I carcinogen Helicobacter pylori (Hp) exploit integrin receptors for the injection of virulence factors into mammalian cells (26.Kwok T. Zabler D. Urman S. Rohde M. Hartig R. Wessler S. Misselwitz R. Berger J. Sewald N. König W. Backert S. Nature. 2007; 449: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). This is achieved by a type IV secretion system (T4SS) consisting of 11 VirB protein orthologs (encoded by virB1–11 genes) and the so-called coupling protein (VirD4, an NTPase). These proteins are encoded by a 40-kb gene cluster known as the cag (cytotoxin-associated gene) pathogenicity island, the cagPAI (27.Peek Jr., R.M. Blaser M.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar, 28.Backert S. Meyer T.F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 29.Amieva M.R. El-Omar E.M. Gastroenterology. 2008; 134: 306-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). We have shown that integrin α5β1 binds to a small 26-kDa protein designated CagL, which is encoded by the open reading frame HP0539 in the cagPAI (26.Kwok T. Zabler D. Urman S. Rohde M. Hartig R. Wessler S. Misselwitz R. Berger J. Sewald N. König W. Backert S. Nature. 2007; 449: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). CagL is predicted to be a functional VirB5 ortholog and structural component of the T4SS pilus (30.Backert S. Fronzes R. Waksman G. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 409-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), as seen with other VirB5 proteins such as that of Agrobacterium tumefaciens (31.Aly K.A. Baron C. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 3766-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). CagL has no significant sequence homology to any known eukaryotic protein. But like FN, CagL carries a RGD motif shown to be important for interaction with the α5β1 integrin (26.Kwok T. Zabler D. Urman S. Rohde M. Hartig R. Wessler S. Misselwitz R. Berger J. Sewald N. König W. Backert S. Nature. 2007; 449: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). However, it has been recently shown in yeast two-hybrid screens that other T4SS proteins such as CagY (VirB10), CagN, and the effector protein CagA can also bind β1 integrin in vitro (32.Jiménez-Soto L.F. Kutter S. Sewald X. Ertl C. Weiss E. Kapp U. Rohde M. Pirch T. Jung K. Retta S.F. Terradot L. Fischer W. Haas R. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000684Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), confirming that Hp targets this integrin member as a receptor for the T4SS. However, mutation of the RGD motif in CagL had no defect in T4SS functions such as the phosphorylation of injected CagA (32.Jiménez-Soto L.F. Kutter S. Sewald X. Ertl C. Weiss E. Kapp U. Rohde M. Pirch T. Jung K. Retta S.F. Terradot L. Fischer W. Haas R. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000684Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In contrast, another very recent study showed a clear role of CagL in activating ADAM17, a metalloprotease involved in catalyzing ectodomain shedding of receptor tyrosine kinase ligands (33.Saha A. Backert S. Hammond C.E. Gooz M. Smolka A.J. Gastroenterology. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In nonstimulated cells, ADAM17 is normally in complex with integrin α5β1 and inactive (34.Bax D.V. Messent A.J. Tart J. van Hoang M. Kott J. Maciewicz R.A. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22377-22386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). During acute Hp infection, however, it was shown that CagL dissociates ADAM17 from the integrin α5β1 and activates ADAM17 (33.Saha A. Backert S. Hammond C.E. Gooz M. Smolka A.J. Gastroenterology. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). This was confirmed by infection with a ΔcagL deletion mutant, which is entirely defective in the latter response, and by genetic complementation with the wild-type (wt) cagL gene or biochemical complementation by the addition of extracellular CagL restoring this function (33.Saha A. Backert S. Hammond C.E. Gooz M. Smolka A.J. Gastroenterology. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). These studies indicate that there is a controversy in the literature about the importance of CagL in T4SS functions and host cell signaling. Thus, the role of CagL needs to be investigated in more detail.Investigating the contribution of each of the various cagPAI proteins for signaling during infection is certainly very difficult to perform because mutation of single genes often lead to complete abolition of T4SS functions. For this purpose, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether purified CagL alone can trigger host cell signaling. We demonstrate that purified CagL mimics a number of cellular functions of FN in the induction of eukaryotic cell spreading and focal adhesion formation, involving the activation of Src, FAK, and EGFR tyrosine kinases. Despite this functional mimicry between CagL and FN, CagL also activates the EGF receptor family tyrosine kinase Her3/ErbB3 under conditions where Her3/ErbB3 is not activated by FN. Our findings support the hypothesis that CagL may promote aberrant signaling cross-talk in the host cells by mimicking FN in the induction of cell spreading and focal adhesion formation while activating FN-independent signaling pathways. CagL may be used as a novel tool for dissecting the regulatory networks that govern FN and integrin signaling.DISCUSSIONHuman FN and its RGD tripeptide motif play an important role in mediating eukaryotic cell-to-cell interactions and triggering signaling, which is important for cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and other processes (3.Humphries M.J. Travis M.A. Clark K. Mould A.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4.Larsen M. Artym V.V. Green J.A. Yamada K.M. Curr. Opin.

The importance of the RGD motif is underlined by the finding that mouse embryos with a mutation to an inactive RGE motif die at day 10 because of severe defects that resemble the phenotype of integrin α5β1-deficient mice (47.Takahashi S. Leiss M. Moser M. Ohashi T. Kitao T. Heckmann D. Pfeifer A. Kessler H. Takagi J. Erickson H.P. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Other studies indicated that FN is a target of microbial pathogens because a number of bacterial proteins have been found to bind FN for adhesion to or invasion of bacteria into host cells (17.Boyle E.C. Finlay B.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18.Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.

Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the present report, we show that the Hp CagL protein mimics FN in the induction of cell spreading, focal adhesion formation, and activation of Src, FAK, EGFR, and Her3/ErbB3 in vitro. CagL therefore represents a novel example of molecular mimicry between a eukaryotic ECM protein and a virulence factor of bacterial origin.We observed that immobilized CagLwt induced host cell spreading and focal adhesion formation that was phenotypically similar to that seen with immobilized FN. The induction of cell spreading by CagL was not as rapid as that induced by FN but became very efficient after 30–60 min of co-incubation. To exclude artifacts, we confirmed that host cells do not spread on immobilized BSA, GST, or polylysine. We also investigated whether CagL can induce cell spreading and focal adhesion formation of different human cell lines (AGS, MKN45, and HeLa) and mouse fibroblast cell lines, thus excluding cell type-specific effects of the observed phenomenon. Moreover, as another control, we could demonstrate that denatured CagLhdn was unable to induce cell spreading and focal adhesion formation, suggesting that proper folding of CagL is essential for the induction of these phenotypes. Finally, we showed that neither immobilized CagLRGA nor CagLRAD mutants were able to induce these responses. Taken together, these findings provide comprehensive evidence that Hp CagL not only interacts with the integrin member α5β1 (26.Kwok T. Zabler D. Urman S. Rohde M. Hartig R. Wessler S. Misselwitz R. Berger J. Sewald N. König W. Backert S. Nature. 2007; 449: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) but is also capable of inducing signaling leading to cell spreading and focal adhesion formation.In healthy tissues, maximal binding of FN to α5β1 integrin requires two internal domains, called FnIII-9 and FnIII-10 (Ref. 48.Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1A). Genetic studies indicated that residues in both domains are involved in contacting the integrin receptor, with aspartate residue 1495 in the RGD motif of FnIII-10 being the most significant contributor to binding energy (48.Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several other residues located on the same face of the molecule as the RGD sequence of FN also contribute to integrin binding, including those within the so-called synergy region in FnIII-9 (48.Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Spitzfaden C. Grant R.P. Mardon H.J. Campbell I.D. J. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CagLwt can bind to integrin α5β1 (dissociation constant Kd = 0.09) and with an affinity higher than that of CagLRGA mutant (Kd = 0.36) (26.Kwok T. Zabler D. Urman S. Rohde M. Hartig R. Wessler S. Misselwitz R. Berger J. Sewald N. König W. Backert S. Nature. 2007; 449: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) or FN (Kd = 0.8) (52.Van Nhieu G.T. Isberg R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24367-24375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, except for the RGD motif, there is no sequence similarity of CagL to FN, and the three-dimensional structure model of CagL is mainly formed by a three α-helix bundle with an protruding globular domain carrying the RGD motif (30.Backert S. Fronzes R. Waksman G. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 409-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the crystal structure of the FN host cell binding domain is composed predominantly of β-sheets (44.Dickinson C.D. Veerapandian B. Dai X.P. Hamlin R.C. Xuong N.H. Ruoslahti E. Ely K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1079-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and therefore appears to be quite different from the predicted structure of CagL. The fact that cyclic CagL-derived RGD peptides alone fail to induce cell spreading confirms that additional structural determinants in CagL are required for triggering cell spreading; identification of these structural determinants by means of site-directed mutagenesis is currently underway in our labs. Determination and subsequent comparison of the three-dimensional structure of CagL with that of FN might provide novel insights into the structural basis underlying the induction of cell spreading or focal adhesion formation by external stimuli.CagL also exhibits neither sequence nor structural homology to the well known bacterial protein invasin (InvA, Yersinia spp.), which binds α5β1 and some other integrins in a manner similar to FN but does not contain an RGD motif (21.Isberg R.R.

Isberg R.R. Bjorkman P.J. Science. 1999; 286: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that invasin and FN recognize similar residues on the integrin receptor, given that the solved crystal structures of their respective integrin-binding regions have very different surface contours (24.Hamburger Z.A. Brown M.S. Isberg R.R. Bjorkman P.J. Science. 1999; 286: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 52.Van Nhieu G.T. Isberg R.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Three important factors have been proposed to enhance invasin-mediated uptake: (i) high affinity binding of integrin receptors by the so-called D4-D5 superdomain (54.Tran Van Nhieu G. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1887-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), (ii) the ability of invasin monomers to undergo homotypic interactions (23.Dersch P. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and (iii) an increase in the concentration of integrin receptors available to bind invasin (23.Dersch P. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 54.Tran Van Nhieu G. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1887-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Mutations that lower the affinity of InvA for integrin receptors, deletion of a region of invasin necessary for homotypic interaction, and depletion of integrins from the host cell all severely depress bacterial uptake, causing extracellular adhesion of the bacteria. Most of the bacteria-host interaction studies used InvA-coupled latex beads or invA mutant bacteria (55.Isberg R.R. Tran Van Nhieu G. Trends. Microbiol. 1994; 2: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the ability of Petri dish-immobilized purified InvA to induce cell spreading or focal adhesion formation of host cells was only marginally investigated. For example, HEp-2 cells incubated on immobilized membrane proteins of an InvA-overproducing Yersinia strain showed signs of spreading (25.Isberg R.R. Leong J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In a similar study, incubation of immobilized purified InvA with T-lymphocytes led to the rapid apoptotic death of these cells (56.Arencibia I. Frankel G. Sundqvist K.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Despite these investigations, the specificity and mechanism by which the Yersinia protein InvA mediates cell spreading in an integrin-dependent manner remain enigmatic.The most striking difference between Yersinia invasin and FN binding is the significantly higher affinity of invasin-receptor binding. This activity is critical both for the protein to promote uptake and as a central virulence determinant for the microorganism. Low affinity integrin ligands, coated on either particles or bacteria, allow efficient adhesion to mammalian cells but have a greatly reduced capacity to promote uptake relative to that seen with invasin (54.Tran Van Nhieu G. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1887-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Given the observation that bacteria expressing active InvA blocked binding of CagL to integrin α5β1 (26.Kwok T. Zabler D. Urman S. Rohde M. Hartig R. Wessler S. Misselwitz R. Berger J. Sewald N. König W. Backert S. Nature. 2007; 449: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), the affinity of InvA to integrin α5β1 is clearly higher (Kd = 0.005) (49.Spitzfaden C. Grant R.P. Mardon H.J. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) than that of CagL or FN. This might explain why CagL does not act as an invasin. Hp is essentially an extracellular pathogen with only ∼2–5% of bacteria occasionally observed intracellularly during infections in vitro (57.Kwok T. Backert S. Schwarz H. Berger J. Meyer T.F. Infect Immun. 2002; 70: 2108-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and in vivo (58.Dubois A. Borén T. Cell. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1108-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, the majority of Hp bacteria remains extracellular and triggers intracellular host cell signaling from the outside (27.Peek Jr., R.M. Blaser M.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar, 28.Backert S. Meyer T.F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 29.Amieva M.R.

Because macrophages contribute to vascular perturbation and tissue injury in hypoxic settings, we tested the hypothesis that RAGE regulates early growth response-1 (Egr-1) expression in hypoxia-exposed macrophages. Molecular analysis, including silencing of RAGE, or blockade of RAGE with sRAGE (the extracellular ligand-binding domain of RAGE), anti-RAGE IgG, or anti-AGE IgG in THP-1 cells, and genetic deletion of RAGE in peritoneal macrophages, revealed that hypoxia-induced up-regulation of Egr-1 is mediated by RAGE signaling. In addition, the observation of increased cellular release of RAGE ligand AGEs in hypoxic THP-1 cells suggests that recruitment of RAGE in hypoxia is stimulated by rapid production of RAGE ligands in this setting. Finally, we show that mDia-1, previously shown to interact with the RAGE cytoplasmic domain, is essential for hypoxia-stimulated regulation of Egr-1, at least in part through protein kinase C betaII, ERK1/2, and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase signaling triggered by RAGE ligands. Our findings highlight a novel mechanism by which an extracellular signal initiated by RAGE ligand AGEs regulates Egr-1 in a manner requiring mDia-1."

The distribution of identified sites of O-mannosylation suggests a limited role for local primary sequence in dictating sites of attachment. Defects in protein glycosylation related to human disease were first reported in the 1980s, and since then, about 40 various types of congenital disorders of glycosylation have been reported (1Jaeken J. Hennet T. Freeze H.H. Matthijs G. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 2008; 31: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The term congenital disorders of glycosylation was first used to describe alterations of the N-glycosylation pathway and was later expanded to include the O-glycosylation pathways (1Jaeken J.

The importance and complexity of O-linked glycosylation have only recently begun to be appreciated (1Jaeken J. Hennet T. Freeze H.H. Matthijs G. J. Inherited Metab.

Biochem. 2004; 73: 491-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In particular, mutations in genes encoding (putative) glycosyltransferases, which catalyze the addition and extension of O-linked mannose-initiated glycans, have garnered increased attention in the last decade given that they are causative for several forms of congenital muscular dystrophy (5Barresi R. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 6Martin P.T. Curr. Mol. Med. 2007; 7: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The most common forms of O-glycosylation on secretory proteins are the mucin-like O-GalNAc structures that are initiated by polypeptide N-α-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment and/or early cis-Golgi (7Ten Hagen K.G. Fritz T.A. Tabak L.A. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 1R-16RCrossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Additionally, other O-linked structures are initiated with alternative monosaccharides, such as O-mannose, O-glucose, O-fucose, O-xylose, and O-GlcNAc on Ser/Thr residues and the O-galactose modification of hydroxylysine residues in collagen domains (4Haltiwanger R.S. Lowe J.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 491-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The diversity of O-mannosylated proteins in mammals, although quite abundant in some tissues (∼30% of O-glycans released from mouse brains (8Chai W. Yuen C.T. Kogelberg H. Carruthers R.A. Margolis R.U. Feizi T. Lawson A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)), has not been well characterized.

Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). The binding to extracellular components such as laminin is dependent upon the addition of O-linked oligosaccharides. Numerous studies have shown that proper post-translational processing of α-DG through the addition of O-mannose structures is crucial for proper muscle and brain development (5Barresi R. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 6Martin P.T. Curr. Mol. Med. 2007; 7: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Endo T. Manya H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 347: 43-56PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular interest, several distinct forms of congenital muscular dystrophy have been linked to defects in glycosyltransferases involved in the O-mannosylation of α-DG (5Barresi R. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 6Martin P.T. Curr. Mol. Med. 2007; 7: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Endo T. Manya H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 347: 43-56PubMed Google Scholar). Defects in glycosyltransferases involved in O-mannose attachment and extension, including POMT1/2 and POMGnT1, as well as the putative glycosyltransferase LARGE, are present in various forms of congenital muscular dystrophy including Walker-Warburg syndrome and Muscle-Eye-Brain disease (5Barresi R. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 6Martin P.T. Curr. Mol. Med. 2007; 7: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Endo T. Manya H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 347: 43-56PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ablation of these gene products in mouse model systems recapitulates much of the pathophysiology of the corresponding human diseases (5Barresi R. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 6Martin P.T. Curr. Mol. Med. 2007; 7: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Endo T. Manya H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 347: 43-56PubMed Google Scholar). Given the importance of O-mannosylation to the function of α-DG, we undertook glycomics and glycoproteomic site mapping of α-DG isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. Because α-DG contains both O-Man- and O-GalNAc-initiated structures, the use of tagging strategies following β-elimination (such as BEMAD (11Wells L. Vosseller K. Cole R.N. Cronshaw J.M. Matunis M.J. Hart G.W. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar)) cannot distinguish glycan type at individual sites. Therefore, we developed and employed methodology for the direct assignment of glycopeptides when coupled with glycomic analysis. O-Glycan analysis was performed on released permethylated glycans using MSn tandem mass spectrometry to define the structural diversity of O-Man- and O-GalNAc-initiated glycans present on the purified α-DG. We then performed direct analysis of the peptides/glycopeptides of α-DG, following tryptic digestion with and without glycosidase treatment, via tandem mass spectrometry. Taking advantage of the ability of an ion trap instrument to perform pseudo-neutral loss-triggered MS3 analysis, we were able to assign specific O-glycan structures to peptides and in many cases to the exact sites of addition on α-DG. This study, which is the first to map endogenously added O-mannose sites from purified functional α-DG, facilitates our understanding of O-mannosylation in general. With respect to α-DG, the study highlights the interplay between the O-Man and O-GalNAc classes of O-glycosylation, which will further the development of future studies designed to unravel structure/function relationships for this important glycoprotein as it relates to the pathophysiology of congenital muscular dystrophy. α-DG was extracted and purified exactly as described previously (12Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed on a 4–20% Tris-HCl precast gel purchased from Bio-Rad. Silver staining was conducted using an adapted protocol from Shevchenko et al. (13Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed on semi-dry transferred polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the VIA4 and IIH6 monoclonal antibodies followed by ECL detection as described previously (12Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The enzyme-treated α-DG sample was prepared by combining 1.5 μg of α-DG in 15 μl of water, 4 μl of 5× incubation buffer (Prozyme), and 1.5 μl of 100 mm dithiothreitol and 6 μl of enzyme mixture (GlycoProTM deglycosylation kit (Prozyme) combined with the prO-LINK extender kit (Prozyme) containing the following enzymes: peptide:N-glycosidase, sialidase A (Arthrobacter ureafaciens), O-glycosidase, β(1–4)-galactosidase, chondroitinase, and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The mock-digested α-DG was prepared similarly but lacked enzyme. Both the mock-digested and glycosidase-treated fractions of α-DG were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Murine laminin-1 was not stable at acidic pH values for coupling to the CM5 chips using the standard amine coupling chemistry. In preparation for binding to the streptavidin chip (SA), laminin-1 was first treated with 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride as described previously by Colognato et al. (14Colognato H. Winkelmann D.A. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 100 mm solution of the serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride containing laminin-1 was incubated overnight on ice. Free 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride was removed using a Microcon-10 (Amicon) microconcentrator. 4-(2-Aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride-treated laminin-1 was then biotinylated at a molar ratio of 40:1 with NHSLC-biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The reaction product was dialyzed free of unreacted NHSLC-biotin and the reaction product confirmed by 4′-hydroxyazobenzene-2-carboxylic acid assay (data not shown). Approximately 609 resonance units of biotinylated laminin-1 was bound on the SA chip during a 70-μl injection (5 μl/min) of 100 μg/ml biotinylated laminin-1 in phosphate-buffered saline. Samples of glycosidase-treated and -untreated α-DG were tested at a flow rate of 10 μl/min over the immobilized laminin-1 for 1 min, followed by a 2-min delayed wash to allow the dissociation phase to be recorded. Binding analysis of α-DG to laminin-1 was performed using a Biacore 3000 (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Binding causes a change in the surface plasmon resonance, which was detected optically and measured in resonance units. Sensograms were collected as the difference in binding to the laminin-1 versus a blank reference channel. The sensor chip surface was regenerated using 20 μl of glycine HCl solution (pH 2.5) after each round of binding. The BIAevaluation software 3.0 (BIAcore) was used to analyze binding data. Purified α-DG, ∼22 μg, was transferred to a glass tube and stored at −80 °C prior to drying on a lyophilizer. To remove any residual detergent that might have been present from the purification process, the dried protein powder was resuspended in acetone and centrifuged. The acetone supernatant was decanted from the protein pellet, and the pellet and any remaining acetone were removed under a stream of nitrogen gas with mild warming (45 °C). The dried sample was resuspended in 440 μl of Milli-Q water, and a 200-μl aliquot was taken for release of O-linked glycans. The aliquot was re-lyophilized and subjected to reductive β-elimination (1 m NaBH4 in 50 mm NaOH, 18 h at 45 °C). The reaction was neutralized by adding 10% acetic acid dropwise while vortexing. The completely neutralized sample was desalted by loading onto a small column of AG50-X8 (1-ml bed volume). Released oligosaccharides were eluted from the column with 3 volumes of 5% of acetic acid, collected, and evaporated to dryness using a SpeedVac. Borate was removed as an azeotrope with methanol and acetic acid by resuspending the dried sample in 9:1 methanol/acetic acid and then drying under a nitrogen stream at 37 °C four times. To aid in analysis of O-linked glycan structures, the released oligosaccharide mixture was permethylated according to the method of Ciucanu and Kerek (15Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). Permethylated glycans were analyzed as described previously (16Aoki K. Porterfield M. Lee S.S. Dong B. Nguyen K. McGlamry K.H. Tiemeyer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30385-30400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, following permethylation, glycans were dissolved in 1 mm NaOH in 50% methanol. Using a nanoelectrospray source, the O-glycan mixture was directly infused into a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ, Thermo Fisher) at a flow rate of 0.4 μl/min. As described previously, total ion mapping was used to detect and quantify the prevalence of individual glycans (17Aoki K. Perlman M. Lim J.M. Cantu R. Wells L. Tiemeyer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9127-9142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The suggested nomenclature from The Consortium for Functional Glycomics was used for all representations of glycan structures in the figures and tables with the undefined hexose or HexNAc species displayed in gray. α-DG purified from rabbit skeletal muscle was digested using either sequence grade trypsin (Promega) alone or in combination with endoproteinases Lys-C (Sigma). The samples were diluted to 40 mm ammonium bicarbonate and reduced with 100 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 56 °C, carboxyamidomethylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide in the dark for 45 min, and then protease-digested overnight at 37 °C. In the case of Lys-C, the digest was carried out in 6 m urea, and the reduction temperature was held at 37 °C followed by dilution to 1 m urea with 40 mm ammonium bicarbonate and then overnight trypsin digest. After digestion, the reaction was quenched with 1% trifluoroacetic acid making the final concentration ∼0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting peptides were dried down using a SpeedVac and stored at −20 °C until ready to analyze. The application of BEMAD to tryptic peptides was as described previously (11Wells L. Vosseller K. Cole R.N. Cronshaw J.M. Matunis M.J. Hart G.W. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). α-DG glycopeptides were analyzed on a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ; ThermoFisher) using an MS3 data-dependent neutral loss method. The glycopeptides were resuspended in 0.5 μl of solvent B (0.1% formic acid, 80% acetonitrile) and 19.5 μl of solvent A (0.1% formic acid), filtered using a 0.2-μm spin filter at 12,000 rpm, and loaded on a 75 μm × 8.5-cm C18 reverse phase column/emitter (packed in-house, YMC GEL ODS-AQ120ÅS-5) using a nitrogen pressure bomb. Peptides were eluted over a 160-min linear gradient increasing from 5 to 100% solvent B over 90 min at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. Each full MS scan from 300 to 2000 m/z yielded five MS/MS scans of the top five most intense peaks with a dynamic exclusion of two for 30 s. Data-dependent MS3 scans were triggered if a neutral loss was observed equal to the singly or doubly charged mass of hexose, HexNAc, fucose, or Neu5Ac (sialic acid) within the top three peaks from the MS/MS scan. The acquired data were searched against a nonredundant rabbit data base (generated March 26, 2004) obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the TurboSequest algorithm (Bio-Works, Thermo Fisher). To aid in identification of glycopeptides, we allowed for a mass increase of 162.1, 203.1, and 365.2 daltons on both threonines and serines looking for the addition of Man, GalNAc, and Hex-HexNAc, respectively. Additionally, peptides that were subjected to BEMAD were searched looking for a mass increase of 136.2 daltons on both serines and threonines as described previously. Output files that failed to a yield a final score (Sf) and probability score (P) above 0.45 and 30, respectively, were not considered further. All remaining spectra were manually evaluated for the presence of glycopeptides and sites of modification and were further validated by TurboSequest searches against the rabbit α-DG FASTA sequence combined with the TurboSequest common contaminants data base. α-DG was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously and validated for purity via silver staining (Fig. 1a) and for functional glycosylation using the IIH6 and VIA41 antibodies (Fig. 1b) that have previously been demonstrated to bind functional and glycosylated α-DG, respectively (12Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Purity of the sample was also determined via trypsin digestion followed by LC-MS/MS. Based on the full-length sequence of α-DG, coverage at 1% false-discovery rate was only 13%. Decorin and calsequestrin were also identified in the sample but contributed less than 5% of the total spectral counts assigned to proteins and thus represent minor co-purifying/contaminating proteins. To increase coverage, α-DG was subjected to glycosidase treatment (with N-glycosidase, sialidase A (A. ureafaciens), O-glycosidase, β(1–4)galactosidase, and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase) that increased the mobility of the protein upon electrophoresis (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, mature α-DG is known to be processed by proteases that cleave off the N terminus (18Kanagawa M. Saito F. Kunz S. Yoshida-Moriguchi T. Barresi R. Kobayashi Y.M. Muschler J. Dumanski J.P. Michele D.E. Oldstone M.B. Campbell K.P. Cell. 2004; 117: 953-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and we were unable to detect any peptides corresponding to this region (Fig. 1c, attempts to determine the N terminus by automated Edman degradation sequencing were unsuccessful suggesting that the N terminus is blocked; data not shown). LC-MS/MS analysis following glycosidase and trypsin/endoproteinase-LysC treatment increased overall coverage to 65% (Fig. 1c) when one takes into account the proposed cleavage site for the mature protein by Kanagawa et al. (18Kanagawa M. Saito F. Kunz S. Yoshida-Moriguchi T. Barresi R. Kobayashi Y.M. Muschler J. Dumanski J.P. Michele D.E. Oldstone M.B. Campbell K.P. Cell. 2004; 117: 953-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and the glycopeptides we observed (supplemental Table 1). Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance experiments were used to confirm that the purified α-DG could bind to laminin in agreement with the method of purification (laminin affinity column) and antibody binding (Fig. 1d). As observed previously, using different methodologies (12Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), treatment of α-DG with sialidase and galactosidase did not have a detrimental effect on laminin binding. Thus, this characterization of the starting material made us confident in moving forward with further analysis of functionally active, glycosylated α-DG. O-Linked glycans were released from α-DG purified from rabbit skeletal muscle by β-elimination, permethylated, and analyzed by nanospray ionization-MS/MS. The generated full scans allowed for detection of released O-linked glycans (Fig. 2a), and structure of the O-glycans observed in the full MS was assigned based on MS/MS fragmentation. To detect glycans in an unbiased manner, the sample was subjected to total ion mapping as described previously (Fig. 2b) (17Aoki K. Perlman M. Lim J.M. Cantu R. Wells L. Tiemeyer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9127-9142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Total ion mapping generates MS/MS fragmentation profiles in small overlapping m/z ranges, allowing the detection of fragments that predict the presence of glycans across the full range of detected m/z values. Detected glycans were further confirmed by MSn fragmentation as needed to define the structure (data not shown). In Fig. 2, c and d, we present two such MS/MS profiles (from a total of over 700) to display the identification of an O-GalNAc- (disialylated T antigen) and an O-Man (the classical O-Man tetrasaccharide, Siaα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Man)-initiated structure. Table 1 includes a list of all of the glycan structures observed from rabbit skeletal muscle α-DG. Although there are more total O-GalNAc-initiated structures observed, O-Man-initiated structures represent ∼50% of the structures by prevalence.TABLE 1Quantification of O-glycans released from α-DG purified from rabbit skeletal muscle Open table in a new tab Having established the range of structures observed on α-DG, we set out to assign these structures to the polypeptide backbone. Purified α-DG was digested using sequence grade trypsin alone or in combination with the endoproteinase Lys-C to increase protein coverage and/or glycosidase treatment to improve digestion, yielding a mixture of peptides and glycopeptides. The resulting mixtures were then analyzed via LC-MS3 using a linear ion trap mass spectrometer. By taking advantage of the capabilities of the linear ion trap mass spectrometer, we were able to apply MS3 fragmentation to glycopeptides that generated neutral losses of glycans in MS/MS. To identify the glycopeptides, a full MS scan was acquired from 300 to 2000 m/z (Figs. 3a and 4a). From the acquired full scan, MS/MS fragmentation spectra were generated for the top five peaks (Figs. 3b and 4b). Upon fragmentation, if a predetermined neutral loss corresponding to a glycan was observed, a data-dependent MS3 scan was triggered on the neutral loss peptide that yielded further fragmentation data for the glycopeptide (Figs. 3, b and c, and 4, b and c, and supplemental figures).FIGURE 4Assignment of an O-Man α-DG glycopeptide. From the full scan acquired at 52.38 min (a), a peak at 895.8 m/z was selected for fragmentation. b, resulting MS/MS of 895.8 m/z yielded the neutral loss of terminal SA residue, which was then followed by MS3 fragmentation indicating the neutral loss of a Gal-GalNAc residue followed by a reducing end Man. The combined glycan structure was determined to belong to a peptide with 971.5 m/z. From examining the MS/MS spectra (data not shown) and the neutral loss-triggered MS3 spectra (c), the site of post-translational modification to the serine within the peptide LETASPPTR is assigned.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Through application of this pseudo-neutral loss-triggered MS3 method, we were able to observe, in many cases, sequential monosaccharide losses, defining the glycan structure from its distal end to its glycosidic attachment to Ser/Thr. The observed losses of glycan (hexose, HexNAc, and Neu5Ac) species were then fitted to the existing confirmed structures on α-DG that had been determined through reductive β-elimination, permethylation, and MSn analysis (Table 1). The modified peptide was able to be determined upon calculating the neutral loss of glycans and the generation of b and y ions in MS/MS and/or MS3. The peptide sequence was able to be determined by comparing a list of the generated peptide (M + H)+ values against a theoretical list of generated peptides for the α-DG protein sequence using the MS digest application from the Prospector website created by the University of California, San Francisco. We also used the BEMAD method to aid in mapping sites modified by O-linked glycans (11Wells L. Vosseller K. Cole R.N. Cronshaw J.M. Matunis M.J. Hart G.W. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Although this method proved to be beneficial by indicating the modified residue in a limited set of cases (supplemental Table 1), it is not capable of distinguishing between O-GalNAc- or O-mannose-initiated glycan structures. Thus, to make more confident assignments of the glycan structure responsible for modification at a particular Ser/Thr residue, we examined the b and y ions that were generated from MS/MS and MS3 fragmentation of the peptide backbone. By comparing the theoretical b and y ions of O-GalNAc- or O-Man-containing fragments with those that were observed in the two spectra, we were able to determine in many cases the exact residue modified. For example, Figs. 3c and 4c show glycopeptides from α-DG that were modified by the addition of an O-GalNAc-initiated glycan structure, disialylated T antigen, and an O-mannose-initiated glycan structure, Siaα2–3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1–2Man, at Ser-475 and Ser-485, respectively. Upon fragmentation, b and y ions still modified by hexose or HexNAc allow unequivocal assignment of the structures to specific residues. Similar strategies were applied for all O-Man- and O-GalNAc-initiated structures, and the results are summarized in Table 2 and supplemental Table 1.TABLE 2Summary of sites of modification and modifying residue(s) Open table in a new tab O-Linked glycans containing mannose were first isolated nearly 30 years ago from an enriched mixture of brain chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, with a core structure suggested to be Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ-1–2Man-Ser/Thr (19Finne J. Krusius T. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10295-10300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, sites of modification have not previously been mapped from native sources for the most well characterized O-mannosylated protein, α-DG. Given the importance of O-glycosylation for proper function of α-DG, we sought here to map defined glycan structures to sites of attachment on the polypeptide from endogenously glycosylated α-DG isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. α-DG was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously and shown to be highly enriched and functionally glycosylated (Fig. 1) (12Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To map glycan structures to specific sites, we first released and permethylated the glycans from the glycoprotein so that we could get detailed fragmentation defining the full set of glycans present on α-DG (Fig. 2). This allowed us to determine that there were at least 21 different O-linked glycans present on α-DG purified from rabbit skeletal muscle. Four of these structures were initiated by O-Man with the classical, previously described (20Smalheiser N.R. Haslam S.M. Sutton-Smith M. Morris H.R. Dell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23698-23703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), Siaα2–3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1–2Man tetrasaccharide structure being the most prevalent (Table 1). Only one branched O-Man structure was observed in rabbit skeletal muscle-derived α-DG at less than 0.1% prevalence (Table 1), consistent with the proposal that the brain-specific enzyme, GnT-Vb (GnT-IX), is responsible for O-Man branching (21Alvarez-Manilla G. Troupe K. Fleming M. Martinez-Uribe E. Pierce M. Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). With the glycans on α-DG defined, direct glycopeptide analysis following enzymatic digestion of the protein was performed via pseudo-neutral loss-triggered MS3 analysis (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). This procedure relies on the neutral loss of a glycan mass to trigger further fragmentation of the glycopeptide. Given the lability of the glycosidic linkage, most glycopeptides generate dominant neutral loss peaks associated with glycan fragmentation upon collision-induced dissociation (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Further fragmentation of the species that has undergone a neutral loss provides further glycan losses, as well as peptide b and y ions to assist in the assignment of the peptide and the site(s) of glycosylation. To facilitate improved digestion and better coverage for the resulting peptides, endoproteinase Lys-C under denaturing conditions followed by trypsin digestion was used. Furthermore, we found that partial deglycosylation greatly facilitated digestion and glycopeptide assignments. Although incomplete exoglycosidase treatment allowed discrimination between sites of O-Man and O-GalNAc initiation, it limited mapping of intact glycan structures at many sites (Table 2 and supplemental Table 1). In several cases, there was not sufficient fragmentation information (i.e. fragments containing glycans) to map the exact site of attachment, but we could assign the glycan to a particular peptide or subset of residues in the peptide (Table 2 and supplemental Table 1). Of note, stretches of Thr residues can be particularly problematic for mapping sites of GalNAc attachment because the molecular weight of two adjacent Thr residues is almost identical to the weight of a HexNAc. In total, we observed 91 glycopeptides in our analyses that allowed us to assign 16 specific O-glycosylated residues within α-DG (Fig. 1c and supplemental figures). In addition, another 16 sites of modification were restricted to a small subset of possible residues (Fig. 1c). As expected, for many of the sites of modification, we saw microheterogeneity; glycopeptides with different glycan structures on the identical residues were observed (supplemental Table 1). We also observed that two sites of glycosylation (Ser-475 and Thr-478) could accept O-Man- and O-GalNAc-initiated glycan structures. This suggests that O-mannosylation, at least on these sites, is substoichiometric because the enzymes for O-Man attachment are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and likely precede the O-GalNAc machinery that is localized to the cis-Golgi and/or endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (7Ten Hagen K.G. Fritz T.A. Tabak L.A. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 1R-16RCrossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 9Endo T. Manya H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 347: 43-56PubMed Google Scholar). In total, we observed 24 sites of glycosylation on rabbit skeletal muscle α-DG, including 9 sites of O-Mannosylation. Recently, an in vitro study by Manya et al. (22Manya H. Suzuki T. Akasaka-Manya K. Ishida H.K. Mizuno M. Suzuki Y. Inazu T. Dohmae N. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20200-20206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), using recombinant POMT1/2 enzymes and synthetic peptides derived from α-DG, concluded that mammalian O-mannosylation is dependent upon a consensus sequence (IXPT(P/X)TXPXXXXPTX(T/X)XX). When we compared the nine sites we identified as O-mannosylated with the proposed consensus site, six of our defined sites do not fit this model. However, in our studies, there are three other unresolved sites of O-Man within a single peptide, containing eight potential sites of modification, that are consistent with their model. The sites reported in the in vitro study, Thr-404, Thr-406, and Thr-414, potentially overlap with the three sites of O-Man modification localized between residues 404 and 424 on endogenously glycosylated α-DG. In 2008, Breloy et al. (23Breloy I. Schwientek T. Gries B. Razawi H. Macht M. Albers C. Hanisch F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18832-18840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), relying on data generated via overexpression of fragments of human α-DG in epithelial cells, argued that O-mannosylation was regulated in a much more complex manner than a simple local primary sequence. Alignment of our O-Man sites generated from endogenous rabbit skeletal muscle α-DG provided no obvious local consensus site for attachment (supplemental Table 2), and thus our findings are in agreement with Breloy et al. (23Breloy I. Schwientek T. Gries B. Razawi H. Macht M. Albers C. Hanisch F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18832-18840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that O-mannosylation of particular residues is not regulated solely by a local consensus sequence. Further work is needed to determine the mechanism by which residues for O-Man addition are selected and to elucidate the effect of O-Man modification on the further modification of the glycoprotein by O-GalNAc-initiated structures. Campbell and co-workers (24Yoshida-Moriguchi T. Yu L. Stalnaker S.H. Davis S. Kunz S. Madson M. Oldstone M.B. Schachter H. Wells L. Campbell K.P. Science. 2010; 327: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that O-mannosyl phosphorylation was present on α-DG and was required for laminin binding. Furthermore, that study placed phosphomannose at Thr-379 on a human α-DG construct isolated from cell lines with minimal LARGE activity. Of particular interest to this study, we were unable to observe the analogous rabbit peptide (residues 374–389) by our methods. Presumably, this is because of an unknown LARGE-dependent modification of the phosphorylated O-Man structure. Without knowledge of the complete chemical nature of the LARGE-dependent modification, peptides bearing this structure would be missed. For completeness, it should also be noted that Thr-381 and Thr-388 of this peptide were also observed to be O-Man modified in the human overexpression study (24Yoshida-Moriguchi T. Yu L. Stalnaker S.H. Davis S. Kunz S. Madson M. Oldstone M.B. Schachter H. Wells L. Campbell K.P. Science. 2010; 327: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and they are in a stretch of sequence similar, but not identical, to the proposed consensus sequence of Endo and co-workers (22Manya H. Suzuki T. Akasaka-Manya K. Ishida H.K. Mizuno M. Suzuki Y. Inazu T. Dohmae N. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20200-20206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, beyond this missed peptide that contains the phosphomannose-containing trisaccharide extended with an unknown LARGE-dependent modification (24Yoshida-Moriguchi T. Yu L. Stalnaker S.H. Davis S. Kunz S. Madson M. Oldstone M.B. Schachter H. Wells L. Campbell K.P. Science. 2010; 327: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), we did not detect four other predicted tryptic peptides of greater than four amino acids in length. Two of these peptides are contiguous and represent the extreme N terminus of the fully processed polypeptide. Given that the N terminus of the mature protein was apparently blocked based on results of automated Edman sequencing, it is not surprising that the extreme N-terminal peptide was not observed as the nature of the moiety blocking the N terminus is unknown. This leaves us with three peptides that we failed to detect, all of which contain Ser/Thr residues. Two of these peptides (residues 338–359 and 550–572) are quite large and contain six and five potential sites of glycosylation, respectively. Thus, it is likely that if multiple sites were utilized for glycosylation, these peptides would exceed the upper mass limit of the instrument (2000 m/z). The remaining unexplained absent peptide is residues 583–597. This peptide only contains one potential site of O-linked glycosylation (Ser-586). Given the modest size of this peptide, its lack of multiple sites of glycosylation, and the fact that both peptides flanking this sequence were assigned, failure to detect this peptide is difficult to explain unless, like peptide 374–389, this peptide also contains the LARGE-modified phosphomannose trisaccharide at Ser-586. Given that we chose to map sites on fully functional α-DG, it is not surprising that we were unable to map the phosphomannose-containing trisaccharide peptide(s) that we had previously assigned in a LARGE-deficient cell line (24Yoshida-Moriguchi T. Yu L. Stalnaker S.H. Davis S. Kunz S. Madson M. Oldstone M.B. Schachter H. Wells L. Campbell K.P. Science. 2010; 327: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). However, based on the absence of detection in this study, we speculate that other peptides, including 583–597 and possibly 338–359 and 550–572, may indeed be modified in a LARGE-dependent manner as well. In conclusion, we have developed and implemented a work flow that enabled us to assign defined O-glycan structures to specific residues on the polypeptide by utilizing both glycomics and glycopeptidomics. The resulting site map describing both O-Man and O-GalNAc initiated glycosylation on α-DG isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle provides a framework for elucidating structure/function relationships for this complex glycoprotein. It should also facilitate a greater understanding of the interplay between O-GalNAcylation and O-mannosylation, two glycosylation pathways that theoretically are competing for the same sites of modification. Given that O-mannosylation is defective in multiple forms of congenital muscular dystrophy, is required for α-DG function, and is likely found on other yet-to-be-identified mammalian proteins, the work presented here lays an essential groundwork for future functional studies. We thank Ariana Combs for purifying the α-DG used in this study and all of the Wells, Bergmann, and Tiemeyer laboratory members for helpful discussions. Note Added in Proof Recently, Nilsson et al.

The objective of this study was to assess the magnitude of under-nutrition and its correlation with malaria among under-five children in south-west Ethiopia. Methods This cross-sectional study was undertaken during March–February, 2009 as part of the baseline assessment of a cluster randomized trial around Gilgel Gibe Hydroelectric dam, south-west Ethiopia. A total of 2410 under-five children were included for anthropometric measurement and blood investigation for the diagnosis of malaria and anemia. The nutritional status of children was determined using the International Reference Population defined by the U.S National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Blood film was used to identify malaria parasite and haemoglobin concentration was determined by Hemo Cue analyzer (HemoCue Hb 301, Sweden). Results Significant proportion (40.4%) of under-five children were stunted (height-for-age<−2SD). The prevalence of under-weight was 34.2%. One third and one tenth of the children had anemia and malaria parasite respectively. Older children were more likely to have under-nutrition. There was no association between malaria and under-nutrition. Children who had malaria parasite were 1.5 times more likely to become anaemic compare to children who had no malaria parasite, [OR = 1.5, (95% CI: 1.1–2.0)]. Conclusion In this study, there is no association between malaria and under-nutrition. Children who have malaria are more likely to be anaemic. Malaria prevention and control program should consider nutrition interventions particularly anemia."

Almost all alginate lyases act endolytically on substrate, thereby yielding unsaturated oligouronic acids having 4-deoxy-l-erythro-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid at the nonreducing end. In contrast, Agrobacterium tumefaciens alginate lyase Atu3025, a member of polysaccharide lyase family 15, acts on alginate polysaccharides and oligosaccharides exolytically and releases unsaturated monosaccharides from the substrate terminal. The crystal structures of Atu3025 and its inactive mutant in complex with alginate trisaccharide (H531A/DeltaGGG) were determined at 2.10- and 2.99-A resolutions with final R-factors of 18.3 and 19.9%, respectively, by x-ray crystallography. The enzyme is comprised of an alpha/alpha-barrel + anti-parallel beta-sheet as a basic scaffold, and its structural fold has not been seen in alginate lyases analyzed thus far. The structural analysis of H531A/DeltaGGG and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis studies proposed the enzyme reaction mechanism, with His(311) and Tyr(365) as the catalytic base and acid, respectively. Two structural determinants, i.e. a short alpha-helix in the central alpha/alpha-barrel domain and a conformational change at the interface between the central and C-terminal domains, are essential for the exolytic mode of action. This is, to our knowledge, the first report on the structure of the family 15 enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2022962195,"Proteolytic priming is a common method of controlling the activation of membrane fusion mediated by viral glycoproteins. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein (SARS-CoV S) can be primed by a variety of host cell proteases, with proteolytic cleavage occurring both as the S1/S2 boundary and adjacent to a fusion peptide in the S2 domain. Here, we studied the priming of SARS-CoV S by elastase and show an important role for residue Thr(795) in the S2 domain. A series of alanine mutants were generated in the vicinity of the S2 cleavage site, with the goal of examining elastase-mediated cleavage within S2. Both proteolytic cleavage and fusion activation were modulated by altering the cleavage site position. We propose a novel mechanism whereby SARS-CoV fusion protein function can be controlled by spatial regulation of the proteolytic priming site, with important implications for viral pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2149087011,"Palmitoylation is emerging as an important and dynamic regulator of ion channel function; however, the specificity with which the large family of acyl palmitoyltransferases (zinc finger Asp-His-His-Cys type-containing acyl palmitoyltransferase (DHHCs)) control channel palmitoylation is poorly understood. We have previously demonstrated that the alternatively spliced stress-regulated exon (STREX) variant of the intracellular C-terminal domain of the large conductance calcium- and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channels is palmitoylated and targets the STREX domain to the plasma membrane. Using a combined imaging, biochemical, and functional approach coupled with loss-of-function (small interfering RNA knockdown of endogenous DHHCs) and gain-of-function (overexpression of recombinant DHHCs) assays, we demonstrate that multiple DHHCs control palmitoylation of the C terminus of STREX channels, the association of the STREX domain with the plasma membrane, and functional channel regulation. Cysteine residues 12 and 13 within the STREX insert were the only endogenously palmitoylated residues in the entire C terminus of the STREX channel. Palmitoylation of this dicysteine motif was controlled by DHHCs 3, 5, 7, 9, and 17, although DHHC17 showed the greatest specificity for this site upon overexpression of the cognate DHHC. DHHCs that palmitoylated the channel also co-assembled with the channel in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and knockdown of any of these DHHCs blocked regulation of the channel by protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation. Taken together our data reveal that a subset of DHHCs controls STREX palmitoylation and function and suggest that DHHC17 may preferentially target cysteine-rich domains. Finally, our approach may prove useful in elucidating the specificity of DHHC palmitoylation of intracellular domains of other ion channels and transmembrane proteins."

Following the initial rounds of translation, the RNA genome is used as the template for the synthesis of a complementary negative strand that, in turn, becomes the template for the synthesis of many positive strands. This asymmetric replication process generates genomic copies that are packaged to make new virions (1Mason P.W. Grubman M.J. Baxt B. Virus Res. 2003; 91: 9-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Picornavirus infection causes rearrangement of intracellular membranes into characteristic vesicles that provide platforms for assembly of the viral RNA replication complex, which largely comprises mature and precursor proteins derived from the P2 and P3 regions of the polyprotein (3Bienz K. Egger D. Troxler M. Pasamontes L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schlegel A. Giddings Jr., T.H. Ladinsky M.S. Kirkegaard K. J.

Targeting of replication complexes to vesicular membranes has a number of potential benefits, such as increasing the local concentration of the viral and cellular proteins co-opted for RNA synthesis or shielding the viral RNA from cellular sensors of infection (6Miller S. Krijnse-Locker J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Rearrangement of intracellular membranes during FMDV and PV infection is accompanied by the disruption of normal cellular protein trafficking and cell surface presentation of viral peptides or release of cytokines; both of these effects may dampen the antiviral response of the host (7Moffat K.

Several of the picornavirus proteins involved in RNA replication (2B, 2C, and 3A) have membrane binding properties, although their precise roles in replication have yet to be fully worked out. Although they are implicated in disturbing the structure and/or function of membranes in host cells, their effects show some variations between different picornaviruses (3Bienz K. Egger D. Troxler M. Pasamontes L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Doedens J.R. Giddings Jr., T.H. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9054-9064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cho M.W.

Virol. 2005; 79: 4382-4395Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For PV, transient expression of 2C or 2BC in mammalian cells induces vesicular clustering, similar to the membrane rearrangements observed during infection (11Cho M.W. Teterina N. Egger D. Bienz K. Ehrenfeld E. Virology. 1994; 202: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar); however, PV 2B, 2BC, or 3A (but not 2C) are each capable of disrupting protein trafficking and cell surface protein expression, with 3A being the most efficient blocker (9Doedens J.R. Giddings Jr., T.H. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9054-9064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Doedens J.R. Kirkegaard K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 894-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In contrast, the vesicles observed during FMDV infection do not cluster (5Monaghan P. Cook H. Jackson T. Ryan M. Wileman T. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 933-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Moffat K. Howell G. Knox C. Belsham G.J. Monaghan P. Ryan M.D. Wileman T. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4382-4395Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The particular FMDV proteins responsible for vesicularization have not been identified, although it has been shown that transient expression of 2B and 2C or of the 2BC precursor (but not 3A) is sufficient to impede trafficking of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi and their expression on the cell surface (7Moffat K. Knox C. Howell G. Clark S.J. Yang H. Belsham G.J. Ryan M. Wileman T. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 1129-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 12Moffat K. Howell G. Knox C. Belsham G.J. Monaghan P. Ryan M.D. Wileman T. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4382-4395Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). 2C is the largest and arguably the most complex of the membrane-binding components of the virus RNA replication complex. FMDV 2C, a 318-amino acid polypeptide, exemplifies the common architecture of picornavirus 2C proteins. It has a predicted amphipathic helix in its N terminus (residues 17–34) (14Teterina N.L. Gorbalenya A.E. Egger D. Bienz K. Rinaudo M.S. Ehrenfeld E. Virology. 2006; 344: 453-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), a feature that has been shown for other picornaviruses to confer the ability to bind to cell membranes (15Echeverri A. Banerjee R. Dasgupta A. Virus Res. 1998; 54: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Echeverri A.C. Dasgupta A.

Virus Res. 2009; 144: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and is thought to be required for both membrane rearrangement and formation of the viral replication complex (3Bienz K. Egger D. Troxler M. Pasamontes L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This predicted helix lies upstream of a well conserved ATPase domain (19Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) formed by residues 60–270. However, FMDV 2C is unusual in lacking a Cys-rich motif at its C terminus that, although conserved in several other 2C proteins, is of unknown function (20Pfister T. Jones K.W. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The ATPase domains of picornavirus 2C proteins contain Walker A and Walker B motifs characteristic of many enzymes that hydrolyze NTPs (19Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 21Mirzayan C. Wimmer E. Virology. 1992; 189: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Teterina N.L. Kean K.M. Gorbalenya A.E. Agol V.I. Girard M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). The detection of a third motif, Motif C, resulted in 2C being classified as an AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) protein subgrouped with superfamily 3 (SF3) helicases, such as the SV40 large T-antigen (LTag) and bovine papillomavirus E1 (E1) DNA helicases (19Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This designation implies that 2C may act as an RNA helicase, but, although the enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing nucleotides (23Pfister T. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6992-7001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24Rodríguez P.L. Carrasco L. J. Biol.

Krogerus C. Fabrichniy I. Hyypiä T. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and binds RNA (see below), no helicase activity has yet been reported for the 2C protein of any picornavirus. In the case of PV, the ATPase activity appears not to be necessary for the induction of membrane rearrangements by 2C (22Teterina N.L. Kean K.M. Gorbalenya A.E. Agol V.I. Girard M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); nevertheless, this activity is clearly important for virus infection because mutations of the Walker A or Walker B motifs that block ATP hydrolysis by PV 2C (23Pfister T. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6992-7001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) also prevent virus replication (21Mirzayan C. Wimmer E. Virology. 1992; 189: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Teterina N.L. Kean K.M. Gorbalenya A.E. Agol V.I. Girard M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The replication of several picornaviruses is also inhibited by low (2–3 mm) concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), an effect that is generally attributable to drug interactions with the 2C protein because mutations in 2C confer resistance on the virus (27Tolskaya E.A. Romanova L.I. Kolesnikova M.S. Gmyl A.P. Gorbalenya A.E. Agol V.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1310-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28Klein M. Hadaschik D. Zimmermann H. Eggers H.J. Nelsen-Salz B. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 29Belsham G.J. Normann P. J. Gen.

Airaksinen A. Domingo E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7131-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Such mutations include an M159L substitution in the Walker B motif of FMDV 2C (29Belsham G.J. Normann P. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and a N179A mutation within the ATPase active site of PV 2C (27Tolskaya E.A. Romanova L.I. Kolesnikova M.S. Gmyl A.P. Gorbalenya A.E. Agol V.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1310-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In vitro studies confirm that 2C is the target of GdnHCl for PV and suggest that the drug works by interfering with the ability of the protein to hydrolyze ATP. The ATPase activity of purified recombinant PV 2C containing the N179A mutation was 100-fold higher than the wild-type protein in the presence of 1 mm drug (23Pfister T. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6992-7001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, not all picornavirus 2C proteins are so sensitive to the drug; for example, 2C from echovirus-9 (EV9) was only very weakly inhibited by GdnHCl even at concentrations as high as 20 mm (28Klein M. Hadaschik D. Zimmermann H. Eggers H.J. Nelsen-Salz B. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consistent with the predicted helicase role of 2C, the protein also binds RNA. PV 2C was readily cross-linked to replicating viral RNA by exposure of infected cells to UV light (3Bienz K. Egger D. Troxler M. Pasamontes L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the specificity of RNA binding by 2C is still unclear. A significant problem in the investigation of the RNA binding, which also impacts the study of other 2C activities, is the generally poor solubility of the recombinant protein. His6-tagged 2C proteins from PV, HAV, and human rhinovirus, which had to be denatured and refolded during purification from inclusion bodies, were reported to bind a specific sequence in the 3′ negative strand viral RNA (32Banerjee R. Dasgupta A. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 2621-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Banerjee R. Echeverri A. Dasgupta A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9570-9578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, following purification under non-denaturing conditions, PV 2C fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP-2C) and His6-tagged versions of 2C from HAV and EV9 were all found to interact nonspecifically with RNA (17Kusov Y.Y. Probst C. Jecht M. Jost P.D. Gauss-Müller V. Arch. Virol. 1998; 143: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Rodríguez P.L. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8105-8110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Klein M. Eggers H.J. Nelsen-Salz B. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2481-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It is notable that in experiments done with His-tagged proteins from HAV and EV9, the 2C-RNA complexes formed aggregates that were unable to enter polyacrylamide gels during mobility shift assays (17Kusov Y.Y. Probst C. Jecht M. Jost P.D. Gauss-Müller V. Arch. Virol. 1998; 143: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Klein M. Eggers H.J. Nelsen-Salz B. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2481-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In common with other AAA+ proteins, SF3 helicases appear to oligomerize into hexamers to form a functional unit (35Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 36Erzberger J.P. Berger J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 93-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 37Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), although the ability of these proteins to assemble into heptamers in the absence of substrates has also been reported (38Costa A. Pape T. van Heel M. Brick P. Patwardhan A. Onesti S. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analysis of the LTag and E1 helicases, for example, revealed a ring structure formed from six subunits (39Enemark E.J. Joshua-Tor L. Nature. 2006; 442: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 40Li D. Zhao R. Lilyestrom W. Gai D. Zhang R. DeCaprio J.A. Fanning E. Jochimiak A. Szakonyi G. Chen X.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 41Hickman A.B. Dyda F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The ATPase active sites of these hexamers are formed at the interfaces between pairs of subunits. In the active sites, one subunit provides the Walker A and B motifs (42Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar) and Motif C (19Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) (sensor 1 in AAA+ nomenclature (35Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar)), whereas an adjacent subunit contributes an arginine residue (the “R finger”) that interacts with the triphosphate tail during catalysis. Consistent with this architecture, the ATPase activity of these proteins is dependent on oligomerization (36Erzberger J.P. Berger J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 93-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The structure of BPV E1 co-crystallized with ATP, and a short length of single-stranded DNA showed that the oligonucleotide was threaded through the pore formed at the center of the hexameric protein and makes differential contacts with each subunit that suggest a plausible helicase mechanism (39Enemark E.J. Joshua-Tor L. Nature. 2006; 442: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Is hexamerization also necessary to activate ATPase hydrolysis and other functions attributed to picornavirus 2C proteins? An interesting recent study showed that the MBP-2C fusion protein prepared from PV 2C formed homo-oligomers that were necessary for the ATPase activity of the protein (43Adams P. Kandiah E. Effantin G. Steven A.C. Ehrenfeld E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22012-22021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), consistent with some earlier work (27Tolskaya E.A. Romanova L.I. Kolesnikova M.S. Gmyl A.P. Gorbalenya A.E. Agol V.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1310-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 44Mirzayan C. Wimmer E.

Virol. 2006; 80: 5327-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, the study found that deletion of the N-terminal 38 residues of the 2C portion of the fusion protein, which removes the predicted amphipathic region involved in membrane binding, abrogated both the oligomerization and ATPase activity of this MBP-2C construct (43Adams P. Kandiah E. Effantin G. Steven A.C. Ehrenfeld E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22012-22021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Curiously, analysis by size exclusion chromatography and electron microscopy revealed that the MBP-2C protein formed oligomeric species that ranged from tetramers to octamers. It is currently not clear why this range of sizes is much broader than found with other AAA+ and related proteins, which are typically hexameric or heptameric (46Crampton D.J. Mukherjee S. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 47Lee S.Y. De La Torre A. Yan D. Kustu S. Nixon B.T. Wemmer D.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 48Toth E.A. Li Y. Sawaya M.R. Cheng Y. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1113-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To further the investigation of the assembly and enzymatic properties of picornavirus 2C proteins, we aimed to engineer recombinant FMDV 2C that could be produced as a soluble protein in Escherichia coli without the encumbrance of a large protein tag. We now show that overexpression of soluble FMDV 2C with an N-terminal His tag can be achieved by deleting the N terminus of the protein up to and including the predicted amphipathic helix. The FMDV 2C(34–318) construct has been used in in vitro studies that complement ongoing investigations of the effects of 2C in transfected mammalian cells (7Moffat K. Knox C. Howell G. Clark S.J. Yang H. Belsham G.J. Ryan M. Wileman T. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 1129-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 12Moffat K. Howell G. Knox C. Belsham G.J. Monaghan P. Ryan M.D. Wileman T. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4382-4395Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Following proteolytic removal of the His tag, the resulting protein can be concentrated to at least 20 mg/ml, and it exhibits specific ATPase activity and nonspecific RNA binding activity. In the absence of ligands, FMDV 2C(34–318) exhibits concentration-dependent oligomerization, the largest form of which is tetrameric. However, in the presence of ATP and RNA, a mutant of 2C(34–318) that can bind but not hydrolyze the nucleotide specifically assembles, even at low concentrations, into a hexameric ring structure, demonstrating that the N terminus of the protein is not required for oligomerization. ATPase assays performed with mixtures of active and inactive 2C subunits support the hypothesis that hexamerization is necessary for a coordinated mechanism of nucleotide hydrolysis. We propose that assembly into hexameric rings is a general requirement for the proper functioning of picornavirus 2C proteins. All PCR and mutagenesis primers used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. A pCR-XL-TOPO plasmid containing the type O1K FMDV 2C sequence (GenBankTM accession number X00871) (derived from a full-length infectious cDNA) was used as template for the generation of FMDV 2C constructs. cDNAs for 2C(1–318), 2C(38–318), 2C(52–318), and 2C(61–318) were amplified by PCR using primers designed to incorporate an upstream BamHI site and a downstream HindIII site to facilitate ligation into a modified pETM-11 plasmid (EMBL) to express the 2C product with a TEVpro cleavable N-terminal His6 tag (49Birtley J.R. Curry S. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2005; 61: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); because of an internal NcoI site in the FMDV 2C sequence, the NcoI site in pETM-11 was first changed to a BamHI site using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). The pET-h2C(38–318) construct was used as template in QuikChange reactions to generate pET-h2C(34–318), which, in turn, served as the template for introduction of point mutations by the same method. Cloning and expression of GST-FMDV 2C is described in the supplemental material. All expression plasmids were sequenced by MWG Eurofins Ltd. Proteins were produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Cells for expression of His6-tagged 2C constructs were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.7. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) was added, and cells were incubated with shaking for a further 4 h at 37 °C before being harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. Pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer, containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100; cells were lysed by sonication. His6-tagged protein was batch-purified on TALON (Clontech). The tag was removed with His6-tagged TEVpro before the protein was reverse purified over a second bed of TALON. The 2C protein was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex S200 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Except where stated otherwise, the soluble 2C proteins obtained were concentrated in the gel filtration buffer to 20 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C. ATP hydrolysis was measured with a colorimetric assay based on the malachite green dye method described previously (50Hohenwallner W. Wimmer E. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1973; 45: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 51Mahuren J.D. Coburn S.P. Slominski A. Wortsman J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ATPase assays were performed in 96-well plates in 100-μl reaction volumes containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2 in the presence of 2C (typically 1.25 μm) and ATP (or another NTP) at the concentrations indicated in the relevant figure legends. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 200 μl of the color reagent described by Mahuren et al. (51Mahuren J.D. Coburn S.P. Slominski A. Wortsman J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The production of phosphate was measured by the increase in absorbance at 590 nm read on a Sunrise 96 well microplate reader (Tecan). UV cross-linking of ATP to FMDV 2C was performed as described by Schumacher et al. (52Schumacher J. Zhang X. Jones S. Bordes P. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). FMDV 2C (20 μm) was incubated with 40 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Samples (10 μl), spotted onto glass slides, were irradiated for 20 min over ice at 254 nm using a 6-watt UVG-54 lamp (UVP Inc.) before analysis by SDS-PAGE.

https://openalex.org/W2145604196,"Mutations in a novel gene, UBIAD1, were recently found to cause the autosomal dominant eye disease Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD). SCD is characterized by an abnormal deposition of cholesterol and phospholipids in the cornea resulting in progressive corneal opacification and visual loss. We characterized lesions in the UBIAD1 gene in new SCD families and examined protein homology, localization, and structure.We characterized five novel mutations in the UBIAD1 gene in ten SCD families, including a first SCD family of Native American ethnicity. Examination of protein homology revealed that SCD altered amino acids which were highly conserved across species. Cell lines were established from patients including keratocytes obtained after corneal transplant surgery and lymphoblastoid cell lines from Epstein-Barr virus immortalized peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These were used to determine the subcellular localization of mutant and wild type protein, and to examine cholesterol metabolite ratios. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies specific for UBIAD1 protein in keratocytes revealed that both wild type and N102S protein were localized sub-cellularly to mitochondria. Analysis of cholesterol metabolites in patient cell line extracts showed no significant alteration in the presence of mutant protein indicating a potentially novel function of the UBIAD1 protein in cholesterol biochemistry. Molecular modeling was used to develop a model of human UBIAD1 protein in a membrane and revealed potentially critical roles for amino acids mutated in SCD. Potential primary and secondary substrate binding sites were identified and docking simulations indicated likely substrates including prenyl and phenolic molecules.Accumulating evidence from the SCD familial mutation spectrum, protein homology across species, and molecular modeling suggest that protein function is likely down-regulated by SCD mutations. Mitochondrial UBIAD1 protein appears to have a highly conserved function that, at least in humans, is involved in cholesterol metabolism in a novel manner."

Both these protection mechanisms involve activation of the xanthophyll cycle, in which the carotenoid violaxanthin is converted to zeaxanthin by violaxanthin de-epoxidase, using ascorbate as the source of reducing power. In this work, following determination of the three-dimensional structure of the violaxanthin de-epoxidase catalytic domain, we identified the putative binding sites for violaxanthin and ascorbate by in silico docking. Amino acid residues lying in close contact with the two substrates were analyzed for their involvement in the catalytic mechanism. Experimental results supported the proposed substrate-binding sites and point to two residues, Asp-177 and Tyr-198, which are suggested to participate in the catalytic mechanism, based on complete loss of activity in mutant proteins. The role of other residues and the mechanistic similarity to aspartic proteases and epoxide hydrolases are discussed."

In addition, we previously found a role for p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) in selective regulation of integrin alphavbeta5-mediated cell motility (Zhang, H., Li, Z., Viklund, E. K., and Strömblad, S. (2002) J. Cell Biol. 158, 1287-1297). This report focuses on the molecular mechanisms of this regulation. We here identified a unique PAK4-binding membrane-proximal integrin beta5-SERS-motif involved in controlling cell attachment and migration. We also mapped the integrin beta5-binding site within PAK4. We found that PAK4 binding to integrin beta5 was not sufficient to promote cell migration, but that PAK4 kinase activity was required for PAK4 promotion of cell motility. Importantly, PAK4 specifically phosphorylated the integrin beta5 subunit at Ser-759 and Ser-762 within the beta5-SERS-motif. Point mutation of these two serine residues abolished the PAK4-induced cell migration, indicating a functional role for these phosphorylations in migration. Our results may give important leads to the functional regulation of integrin alphavbeta5, with implications for vascular permeability, angiogenesis, and cancer dissemination."

In concerted action with a range of specific protein partners called response regulators (RRs), they conform two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs), present in all three major life divisions (1Plowman G.D.

Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (REVIEWS3013)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although TCSs represent the most abundant signaling system within bacteria, for unknown evolutionary reasons they are absent in higher eukaryotes, including mammals. The only mammalian HK relatives are the nucleus-encoded mitochondrial dehydrogenase kinases, which phosphorylate specific serine residues (3Machius M. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 11218-11223Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). histidine kinase response regulator two-component signal transduction system ATP-binding domain dithiothreitol multiple sequence alignment matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tobacco etch virus time-of-flight root mean squared deviation. Intracellular HK domains catalyze an ATP-dependent protein kinase activity, allowing the HK to autophosphorylate a specific histidine, in a signal-regulated fashion. Once phosphorylated, the cytoplasmic core catalyzes a subsequent phosphotransfer reaction, swapping the histidine-linked phosphate group onto a specific aspartate residue in the receiver domain of the cognate RR. Many HKs catalyze a further third type of reaction, whereby the unphosphorylated HK specifically promotes the dephosphorylation of its cognate phospho-RR through a protein-phosphatase mechanism. Those HKs that are able to catalyze autokinase and RR-phosphatase reactions have been shown to tightly balance these two functions as a key to proper signaling through the HK-controlled pathway (4Hsing W. Russo F.D. Bernd K.K. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A large array of TCSs is expressed at any given time in a cell. One of the most addressed issues in this regard is the interaction network among HKs and RRs, because most bacterial species express 20–30 HK-RR pairs or even more, and yet any given histidine kinase has only one or two cognate response regulators, implying minimal cross-talk among different pathways (5Laub M.T. Goulian M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 121-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 6Siryaporn A. Goulian M. Mol.

Cell. 2008; 133: 1043-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). These specificity issues deserve to be analyzed in greater detail, taking into account the significant global structural conservation among HKs. Atomic level differences cannot be underestimated as the basis of distinctive and specific regulatory and mechanistic determinants, affecting each one of the functional steps in HK-mediated reactions. Structural analyses reveal a modular architecture in HKs, with variations in domain organization that define HK classes I and II (8Dutta R. Qin L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In both groups, the three-dimensional architecture predicts extensive movement of the ATP-binding domain (ABD) to physically interact with the histidine-containing phosphotransfer domain, given that autophosphorylation appears to occur exclusively within the dimer. In class I HKs the phosphotransfer domain immediately precedes the ABD and mediates HK dimerization (hence called the dimerization and histidine phosphotransfer (DHp) domain), whereas in class II enzymes it is not involved in dimerization and several additional domains intervene between the phosphotransfer and ABD domains. Sequence-based classification of the different domains in HKs is also useful in structure/functional analyses. According to the DHp domains, HKs have been grouped into four Pfam families (9Finn R.D. Tate J. Mistry J. Coggill P.C. Sammut S.J. Hotz H.R. Ceric G. Forslund K. Eddy S.R. Sonnhammer E.L. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar): whereas ∼85% can be assigned to the HisKA group (PF00512), ∼10% of all known histidine kinases belong to the HisKA_3 family (PF007730). Concerning the ABDs, HKs have been clustered in 11 families (2Wolanin P.M. Thomason P.A. Stock J.B. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (REVIEWS3013)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), noting that three-dimensional structural information is still lacking for five of them. In terms of the autophosphorylation mechanism, some HKs like EnvZ and NtrB (10Cai S.J. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Ninfa E.G. Atkinson M.R. Kamberov E.S. Ninfa A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7024-7032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) autophosphorylate following a trans pathway, i.e. one monomer phosphorylating the histidine of the other. Instead, HK853 and PhoR have recently been shown to perform autokinase catalysis in cis (12Casino P. Rubio V. Marina A. Cell. 2009; 139: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation appears to proceed according to a mutually exclusive behavior, either cis- or trans-acting. Given the fact that the ATP-binding domains of HKs are flexible in the kinase competent state (13Albanesi D. Martín M. Trajtenberg F. Mansilla M.C. Haouz A. Alzari P.M. de Mendoza D. Buschiazzo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16185-16190Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the cis/trans exclusion is likely correlated to specific interdomain configurations at the interaction surface. As clearly demonstrated for the HK-RR interaction, interfaces seem to be crucial to determining specificity in HK signal transduction (7Skerker J.M. Perchuk B.S. Siryaporn A. Lubin E.A. Ashenberg O.

We wished to explore whether structural constraints play a role in defining specific orientations for interacting surfaces between the ABD and the DHp domains in HKs, eventually relevant during autophosphorylation catalysis. We focused on the protein DesK from Bacillus subtilis, a class I HK (14Bilwes A.M. Alex L.A. Crane B.R. Simon M.I. Cell. 1999; 96: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) displaying an N-terminal sensor domain (∼150 residues) with almost no extracellular region, other than the loops that connect the four or five transmembrane segments (15Albanesi D. Mansilla M.C. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The transmembrane region can sense temperature-modulated fluidity changes of lipid bilayers (13Albanesi D. Martín M. Trajtenberg F. Mansilla M.C. Haouz A. Alzari P.M. de Mendoza D. Buschiazzo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16185-16190Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), transmitting the signal toward the C-terminal cytoplasmic catalytic core (∼220 residues), hereafter called DesKC. The cold thermal stimulus is detected by DesK, which then interacts with its cognate RR, DesR, constituting a canonical TCS. In vitro, DesKC has been shown to catalyze three different reactions depending on the phosphorylation states of the partners: its own phosphorylation, phosphotransfer to DesR, and dephosphorylation of phospho-DesR (15Albanesi D. Mansilla M.C. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the switch from a kinase- to a phosphatase-biased activity in full-length DesK is temperature-regulated through the action of the trans-membrane segments (13Albanesi D. Martín M. Trajtenberg F. Mansilla M.C. Haouz A. Alzari P.M. de Mendoza D. Buschiazzo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16185-16190Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In vivo experiments have shown that DesK functions as a kinase at cold temperatures (15Albanesi D. Mansilla M.C. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Aguilar P.S. Hernandez-Arriaga A.M. Cybulski L.E. Erazo A.C. de Mendoza D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), autophosphorylating a conserved residue (His188) in the DHp domain. This phosphoryl group is then transferred to a receiver aspartate in DesR, a DNA-binding RR that then activates the transcription of des (encoding for the acyl lipid desaturase Δ5-Des). Unsaturated fatty acyls in phospholipids, the product of Δ5-Des activity, raise the membrane’s fluidity, triggering the switch of DesK from a kinase to a phosphatase state. As a consequence, the concentration of phospho-DesR falls off, leading to shutdown of des transcription (16Aguilar P.S. Hernandez-Arriaga A.M. Cybulski L.E. Erazo A.C. de Mendoza D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). DesK is a HisKA_3 HK that belongs to the HPK7 family, together with nitrate/nitrite-linked regulation TCS histidine kinases, namely NarQ and NarX (17Noriega C.E. Schmidt R. Gray M.J. Chen L.L. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3869-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), among many others. We now report the crystal structure of the ABD of DesK at 1.8 Å resolution, disclosing new information about HPK7 histidine kinases. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental structure of a histidine kinase in complex with its physiologic substrate (ATP). Structural analyses, complemented by an extensive in silico study of sequence conservation and phosphotransfer intermediate-state modeling, allow us to extend the current knowledge of HKs. In particular, we pinpoint key residues at the domain-domain interaction surface, enabling us to predict the geometry of the interdomain interface during autophosphorylation. Enzymatic characterization of wild-type DesKC, as well as of selected structure-based point mutants, confirm the functional role of conserved residues in helix α5, far from the catalytic center, strongly suggesting that domain-domain interfaces play a key role in catalysis regulation. Further supporting the structural hypotheses, we engineered cysteine mutants on the basis of the predicted interdomain orientation, allowing us to trap a covalent autophosphorylation intermediate state. The plasmids used for expression correspond to: the entire cytoplasmic region DesKC (residues 155–367), the point mutant DesKCH188V (as described in Ref. 15Albanesi D. Mansilla M.C. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and full-length DesR (see Ref. 18Cybulski L.E. del Solar G. Craig P.O. Espinosa M. de Mendoza D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39340-39347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The engineered Cys mutants (G192C/G334C, Q193C/G334C, and S196C/G334C), as well as DesKCE342A and DesKCE343A were generated using the QuikChange multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. DesKC and derived mutants were expressed as N-terminal His6 tag fusion proteins, including a TEV protease cleavage site for tag removal, in Escherichia coli strain M15/pREP4. Protein purification was performed with standard Ni2+-affinity chromatography using a HisTrap column (Amersham Biosciences), then dialyzed against an excess volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT at room temperature, in the presence of a 1/40 (w/w) ratio of His-tagged TEV protease (19van den Berg S. Löfdahl P.A. Härd T. Berglund H. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 121: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A second Ni2+ column was performed, flow-through was concentrated (Vivaspin®, Sartorius), and injected into a HiLoadTM 16/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm DTT. After size-exclusion chromatography, the proteins were concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml and stored in aliquots at −80 °C for further use in crystallization trials. His6-tagged DesR was overexpressed in the same E. coli strain and purified following a similar protocol as DesKC, with no proteolytic step. Serendipitous proteolysis of DesKCH188V resulted in the reproducible crystallization of the ATP-binding domain (DesKABD, spanning residues 243–367). Briefly, DesKCH188V was mixed with DesR (1:1 molar ratio) in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm BeF3. Vapor diffusion crystallization in hanging drops was performed by mixing 2 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml total protein) with 2 μl of reservoir solution (20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m NH4Cl). Multicrystals grew very slowly and were further used as microseeds in fresh drops with identical mother liquor, resulting in single crystals of DesKABD, which typically diffracted to ∼1.6–1.8 Å resolution. Single crystals were cryoprotected in mother liquor containing 25% glycerol and 1 m NaI for 60 s, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored until data collection. X-ray diffraction data (Table 1) were collected at the Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, at 108 K (Cryostream Series 700, Oxford Cryosystems) with CuKα radiation (1.5418 Å), using a microsource MicroMax007-HF rotating copper anode (Rigaku), Varimax-HF mirrors (Rigaku), and a Mar345 image plate detector (Mar Research). Highly redundant data sets were collected and processed using Mosflm/Scala (20Collaborative Computational Project Number 4. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by single anomalous diffraction using the signal from the iodide atoms. Experimental electron density maps allowed for chain tracing and subsequent phase-restrained model refinement with TLS according to standard procedures. Full details of structure solution and model refinement are given in the supplemental materials.TABLE 1Data collection, phasing and refinement statistics Open table in a new tab Atomic coordinates of the dimerization DHp domain of DesK (residues 176–242) were obtained from our previous report (13Albanesi D.

The ATP and Mg2+ were treated as a single residue; corresponding bonds and angles were defined to keep appropriate cation coordination geometry. The DesKCABD model was first subjected to a simulated annealing/molecular dynamics protocol (CNS 1.2 (22Brunger A.T. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2728-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar)) consisting of heating to 3000 K and a slow cooling to 300 K in 60 steps (3.5 fs). All atomic positions of DesKCABD were restrained, except for the ATP lid (residues 326–334) and the N-terminal residues (residues 243–246). We generated 20 different conformations of these two fragments using different initial velocities. The ATP lid loop ensemble was used to rule out effects associated to ATP lid flexibility, which has been extensively reported, even in the presence of ADP or non-hydrolysable ATP analogues (13Albanesi D. Martín M. Trajtenberg F. Mansilla M.C. Haouz A. Alzari P.M. de Mendoza D. Buschiazzo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16185-16190Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Bilwes A.M.

As for the four N-terminal residues in the ABD, allowed flexibility should take into account eventual effects of different initial dispositions on the final interdomain geometry. The used distance restraints (ambiguous interaction restraints (AIR)) were: 1) His188 Nɛ2 of DHp monomer A, linked to ATP Pγ in DesKABD and 2) Lys242 main-chain C of DHp monomer B, with DesKABD Gly243 N, restoring the intrachain peptidic bond. The alternative restraint His188 Nɛ2 of DHp monomer B linked to DesKABD ATP Pγ (modeling a cis-acting autophosphorylation configuration), was also subjected to computations, resulting in lower energy scores and not further analyzed. To test the robustness of the results, independent simulations were run with different initial settings, including alternative rotamers and protonation states for His188, as well as different AIR force constant values. Several reports point to Nɛ2 as the most reactive center engaged in histidine phosphorylation (25Lott J.S. Paget B. Johnston J.M. Delbaere L.T. Sigrell-Simon J.A. Banfield M.J. Baker E.N. J. Biol.

Given that no major differences were recorded comparing Nɛ2 with Nδ1, Nɛ2 was ultimately kept as the atom to define the phospho-His distance restraints in further analyses, although experimental evidence is not available to conclude which imidazole nitrogen is actually reactive during DesK autophosphorylation. A total of 3000 structures was generated during the rigid-body energy-minimization step. The best 300 structures were refined in the semi-flexible annealing step and then subjected to a final refinement with explicit solvent. For the remaining parameters, we used HADDOCK default settings, as well as for the scoring function used to sort structures after the rigid-body and semi-flexible steps. Four replicates were done for this docking protocol to assess whether and how the obtained structures constituted a robust result. The same protocol was used for other DHp states, from the structures of DesKCH188V (3EHH) and DesKC_wt-P (3GIG). Root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) values were computed through tailored (Tool command language) scripting within VMD (27Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38428) Google Scholar) upon superposition of the Cα atoms of the DHp domain onto the best-scored structure model. A full referenced description is included in the supplemental materials. Briefly, homologous sequences were retrieved from bacterial genomes stored at the IMG system (28Markowitz V.M. Kyrpides N.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 395: 35-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a standard BLASTp search. Unique sequences (406) were then aligned with the program Muscle. “HisKA_3” histidine kinases were retrieved from Pfam, and 762 unique proteins thereof were aligned with Muscle. The alignments displayed in Fig. 3 are a subset of the original multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of Pfam sequences, obtained by trimming the MSA into a non-redundant set of proteins with a cutoff of 88% pairwise identity. Some long proteins (>700 residues) were also manually removed from this set, and new MSAs were computed with Mafft (29Katoh K. Toh H. Brief Bioinform. 2008; 9: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2866) Google Scholar) for the reduced sets. For analyses concentrating in HPK7 “NarQ/DesK-like” proteins (supplemental Fig. S1), sequences sharing the Pfam DHp-ABD architecture (808) were retrieved and formatted into a BLASTp-searchable database. NarQ and DesK were then used as queries against this smaller in-house database. MSAs were mapped onto the molecular surfaces of DesKABD and the DHp domain (using the same DesK models as for the docking calculations). Oxidation and Cys-disulfide formation of the Cys-engineered mutants (DesKC G192C,G334C, Q193C,G334C, and S196C,G334C) were triggered by incubating 10 μm protein in contact with air. Other procedures were also assayed, seeking for more rapid and higher yield oxidations, although these resulted in more drastic side reactions. Briefly, 10–100 μm hydrogen peroxide, and preformed complexes ∼0.2 mm Cu(II)-(phenanthroline)3 or Cu(II)-(bathocuproine disulfonate)2, were incubated for different times with purified protein. In all cases, thiol oxidation was stopped by incubation with 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide and 1 mm EDTA. Aliquots were analyzed with SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, with or without previous reduction (100 mm DTT). Thiol air oxidation was the mildest and most specific (data not shown) and selected for detailed analyses. Protein samples from selected SDS-PAGE bands were subjected to tryptic digestion with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 35 °C, overnight. Peptides were extracted from gels with 60% acetonitrile in 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid. Eluates were concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and desalted using reversed-phase microcolumns (C18 OMIX pipette tips, Varian). Samples were then directly spotted onto the mass spectrometer sample plate with 2 ml of matrix solution (saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid). Mass spectra of positive ions were acquired in reflector mode with a MDS SCIEX 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF instrument (Applied Biosystems). Peptide analysis was performed using both Mascot Peptide Mass Fingerprint searching mode (Matrix Science) and GPMAW32 (version 4.02, Lighthouse Data, San Diego, CA). The following modifications were considered: disulfides, N-ethylmaleimide-blocked thiols, reduced thiols, and oxidized methionine. Autophosphorylation and ATPase activities, resulting in net ATP consumption, were measured with a coupled enzyme assay (30Lindsley J.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 95: 57-64PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the production of ADP was coupled to the oxidation of NADH by pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma). The coupling system was in large excess to avoid saturation, and the oxidation of NADH was measured at 340 nm in a Cary® UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian) at 24 °C. The reaction mixtures contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 145 mm KCH3CO2, 8 mm MgCl2, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 240 mm NADH, 5 units of pyruvate kinase, 23 units of lactate dehydrogenase, and different ATP concentrations, in 200 μl of final volume. In the absence of DesKC the NADH oxidation was stable and linear for several minutes. Before starting the reaction, we preincubated the coupled system with ATP to convert the small initial ADP contamination to ATP. To start the reaction, wild-type DesKC or selected DesKC point mutants were added at 22 μm final concentration. Fitting of raw kinetic data using Michaelis-Menten functions was performed with the program Origin v. 8 (Originlab). In the case of wt DesKC, we could obtain more precise initial rate values by first fitting the biphasic time course to an exponential plus a linear function model (Equation 1), where the A1 and A2 terms are the amplitudes of the exponential and linear phases, respectively; k2 is the constant rate of the linear phase (k2 < 0), whereas k1 is a substrate concentration-dependent rate coefficient used to calculate the initial velocity V0 for the exponential non-turnover phase in Equation 2. View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The parameter f is the stoichiometry factor relating the concentration of phosphorylatable histidine sites with respect to total enzyme concentration [E]. This approach takes advantage of the integral method for determining initial rates with higher precision (31Espenson J. Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms. 2nd Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co, New York1995: 15-45Google Scholar). For the evaluation of GTP as a potential substrate of DesKC, and given that the coupled enzyme pyruvate kinase is able to use GDP, we followed the same protocol described above, substituting ATP for GTP at identical concentrations. To test if GTP behaves as a competitive inhibitor, eventually indicating DesKC GTP-binding capacity, 5 mm GTP was added in competition assays that contained 0.5 mm ATP. Orthorhombic crystals of the C-terminal ATP-binding domain of DesK (DesKABD) were initially obtained by serendipitous proteolysis, during DesKC-DesR crystallization assays. Proteolysis was found to be reproducible and may well be linked to the enrichment of a particularly unstable form of DesKC under the conditions used for protein-protein complex formation. The structure was determined at 1.8-Å resolution, phased using single wavelength anomalous diffraction (Table 1), after quick-soaking the crystals with NaI. Direct methods were used to determine the iodide positions. Subsequent phase calculation and refinement resulted in high quality electron density maps (Fig. 1), which allowed for straightfo"

The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), its drug resistance and risk factors in Dhaka Central Jail, the largest prison in Bangladesh. Methods Cross sectional survey with, active screening of a total number of 11,001 inmates over a period of 2 years. Sputum samples from TB suspects were taken for acid- fast bacilli (AFB) microscopy, culture and drug susceptibility testing. Results Among 1,781 TB suspects 245 (13.8%) were positive for AFB on microscopy and/or culture. The prevalence rate of sputum- positive pulmonary TB was 2,227/100,000. Fifty three cases (21.6% of 245 cases) were AFB- negative on microscopy but were found positive on culture. Resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol was 11.4%, 0.8%, 22.4% and 6.5% respectively. No multidrug resistance was observed. The main risk factors of TB in prison were exposure to TB patients (adjusted odds ratio 3.16, 95% CI 2.36–4.21), previous imprisonment (1.86, 1.38–2.50), longer duration of stay in prison (17.5 months for TB cases; 1.004, 1.001–1.006) and low body mass index which is less than 18.5 kg/m2 (5.37, 4.02–7.16). Conclusions The study results revealed a very high prevalence of TB in the prison population in Dhaka Central Jail. Entry examinations and active symptom screening among inmates are important to control TB transmission inside the prison. Identifying undiagnosed smear-negative TB cases remains a challenge to combat this deadly disease in this difficult setting."
https://openalex.org/W1982835879,"Categorization is a basic mental process that helps individuals distinguish among groups of negative and positive objects, e.g., poisons and nutrients, or predators and prey. Monkey experiments have suggested that lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) participates in learning and processing visual categories. However, in humans category specific visual agnosia follows inferior temporal cortex but not LPFC damage. Here, we use a new behavioral approach to show that both normal monkeys and those with bilateral removal of LPFC learn and generalize perceptual categories of related visual stimuli rapidly without explicit instruction. These results strongly indicate that visual categorization occurs at some earlier stage of feed-forward processing, presumably in temporal cortex, without top-down information from LPFC."
https://openalex.org/W2138668032,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) acts via G-protein-coupled receptors on gonadotrophs to stimulate synthesis and secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. It is secreted in pulses, and its effects depend on pulse frequency, but decoding mechanisms are unknown. Here we have used an extracellular signal regulated kinase-green fluorescent protein (ERK2-GFP) reporter to monitor GnRH signaling. GnRH caused dose-dependent ERK2-GFP translocation to the nucleus, providing a live-cell readout for activation. Pulsatile GnRH caused dose- and frequency-dependent ERK2-GFP translocation. These responses were rapid and transient, showed only digital tracking, and did not desensitize under any condition tested (dose, frequency, and receptor number varied). We also tested for the effects of cycloheximide (to prevent induction of nuclear-inducible MAPK phosphatases) and used GFP fusions containing ERK mutations (D319N, which prevents docking domain-dependent binding to MAPK phosphatases, and K52R, which prevents catalytic activity). These manipulations had little or no effect on the translocation responses, arguing against a role for MAPK phosphatases or ERK-mediated feedback in shaping ERK activation during pulsatile stimulation. GnRH also caused dose- and frequency-dependent activation of the α-gonadotropin subunit-, luteinizing hormone β-, and follicle-stimulating hormone β- luciferase reporters, and the latter response was inhibited by ERK1/2 knockdown. Moreover, GnRH caused frequency-dependent activation of an Egr1-luciferase reporter, but the response was proportional to cumulative pulse duration. Our data suggest that frequency decoding is not due to negative feedback shaping ERK signaling in this model."
https://openalex.org/W1812170084,"Growth factor stimulation induces c-Jun-dependent survival of primary endothelial cells. However, the mechanism of c-Jun anti-apoptotic activity has not been identified. We here demonstrate that in response to growth factor treatment, primary human endothelial cells as well as mouse fibroblasts respond with an increased expression of c-Jun that forms a complex with ATF2. This complex activates the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-X(L). By site-directed mutagenesis experiments, we identified two AP-1-binding sites located within the proximal promoter of the Bcl-X gene. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that these AP-1 sites are required for the transcriptional activation of the promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that in response to growth factor treatment, the heterodimer c-Jun.ATF2 binds to these functional AP-1 sites. Silencing of either c-Jun or ATF2 demonstrated that both nuclear factors are required for the activation of the proximal Bcl-X promoter. Taken together, our experiments provide evidence that growth factor-independent signaling pathways converge in the formation of an active c-Jun.AFT2 dimer, which induces the expression of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-X(L) that mediates a pro-survival response."

Mycoplasma pulmonis is a naturally occurring respiratory pathogen in mice. In the current study, we used TLR-transfected HEK cells and TLR2(-/-) bone marrow-derived dendritic cells to demonstrate TLR2-mediated events are important in the initial host-mycoplasma interactions promoting cytokine responses. As we found alveolar macrophages expressed TLR1, TLR2 and TLR6 mRNAs, a role for TLR2 in innate immune clearance in lungs was examined. Three days post-infection, TLR2(-/-) mice had higher M. pulmonis numbers in lungs, but not in nasal passages. However, TLR2(-/-) mice had higher lung cytokine levels, indicating TLR2-independent mechanisms are also involved in host responses. Thus, TLR2 plays a critical role in the ability of innate immunity to determine M. pulmonis numbers in the lung, and it is likely that early after respiratory infection that TLR2 recognition of M. pulmonis triggers initial cytokine responses of host cells."

The three polypeptides are O-substituted by mycolic acids, long chain alpha-alkyl and beta-hydroxy fatty acids specifically produced by members of the Corynebacterineae suborder. To date these acids were described only as esterifying trehalose and arabinogalactan, and less frequently glycerol, important components of the highly impermeable outer barrier of Corynebacterineae. We show that the post-translational mycoloylation of PorA occurs at Ser-15 and is necessary for the pore-forming activity of C. glutamicum."

https://openalex.org/W2129763311,"The C-terminal 95 kDa fragment of some isoforms of vertebrate agrins is sufficient to induce clustering of acetylcholine receptors but despite two decades of intense agrin research very little is known about the function of the other isoforms and the function of the larger, N-terminal part of agrins that is common to all isoforms. Since the N-terminal part of agrins contains several follistatin-domains, a domain type that is frequently implicated in binding TGFβs, we have explored the interaction of the N-terminal part of rat agrin (Agrin-Nterm) with members of the TGFβ family using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and reporter assays. Here we show that agrin binds BMP2, BMP4 and TGFβ1 with relatively high affinity, the KD values of the interactions calculated from SPR experiments fall in the 10−8 M–10−7 M range. In reporter assays Agrin-Nterm inhibited the activities of BMP2 and BMP4, half maximal inhibition being achieved at ∼5×10−7 M. Paradoxically, in the case of TGFβ1 Agrin N-term caused a slight increase in activity in reporter assays. Our finding that agrin binds members of the TGFβ family may have important implications for the role of these growth factors in the regulation of synaptogenesis as well as for the role of agrin isoforms that are unable to induce clustering of acetylcholine receptors. We suggest that binding of these TGFβ family members to agrin may have a dual function: agrin may serve as a reservoir for these growth factors and may also inhibit their growth promoting activity. Based on analysis of the evolutionary history of agrin we suggest that agrin's growth factor binding function is more ancient than its involvement in acetylcholine receptor clustering."
https://openalex.org/W2027770431,"Basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins are one of the largest transcription factor families that regulate a wide range of cellular functions. Owing to the stability of their coiled coil structure leucine zipper (LZ) domains of bZIP factors are widely employed as dimerization motifs in protein engineering studies. In the course of one such study, the X-ray structure of the retro-version of the LZ moiety of yeast transcriptional activator GCN4 suggested that this retro-LZ may have ribonuclease activity. Here we show that not only the retro-LZ but also the authentic LZ of GCN4 has weak but distinct ribonuclease activity. The observed cleavage of RNA is unspecific, it is not suppressed by the ribonuclease A inhibitor RNasin and involves the breakage of 3',5'-phosphodiester bonds with formation of 2',3'-cyclic phosphates as the final products as demonstrated by HPLC/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Several mutants of the GCN4 leucine zipper are catalytically inactive, providing important negative controls and unequivocally associating the enzymatic activity with the peptide under study. The leucine zipper moiety of the human factor c-Jun as well as the entire c-Jun protein are also shown to catalyze degradation of RNA. The presented data, which was obtained in the test-tube experiments, adds GCN4 and c-Jun to the pool of proteins with multiple functions (also known as moonlighting proteins). If expressed in vivo, the endoribonuclease activity of these bZIP-containing factors may represent a direct coupling between transcription activation and controlled RNA turnover. As an additional result of this work, the retro-leucine zipper of GCN4 can be added to the list of functional retro-peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2146806766,"The mechanism of chain selection and trimerization of fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACITs) differs from that of fibrillar collagens that have special C-propeptides. We recently showed that the second carboxyl-terminal non-collagenous domain (NC2) of homotrimeric collagen XIX forms a stable trimer and substantially stabilizes a collagen triple helix attached to either end. We then hypothesized a general trimerizing role for the NC2 domain in other FACITs. Here we analyzed the NC2 domain of human heterotrimeric collagen IX, the only member of FACITs with all three chains encoded by distinct genes. Upon oxidative folding of equimolar amounts of the alpha1, alpha2, and alpha3 chains of NC2, a stable heterotrimer with a disulfide bridge between alpha1 and alpha3 chains is formed. Our experiments show that this heterotrimerization domain can stabilize a short triple helix attached at the carboxyl-terminal end and allows for the proper oxidation of the cystine knot of type III collagen after the short triple helix."
https://openalex.org/W1994893369,"Starfish oocytes arrest at metaphase of the first meiotic division (MI arrest) in the ovary and resume meiosis after spawning into seawater. MI arrest is maintained by lower intracellular pH (pH(i)) and release from arrest by cellular alkalization. To elucidate pH(i) regulation in oocytes, we cloned the starfish (Asterina pectinifera) Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 (ApNHE3) expressed in the plasma membrane of oocytes. The cytoplasmic domain of ApNHE3 contains p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90Rsk) phosphorylation sites, and injection of a constitutively active p90Rsk and the upstream regulator Mos to immature oocytes, stimulated an increase in pH(i). This increase was blocked by 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride, a NHE inhibitor, and SL0101, a specific Rsk inhibitor. The MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 blocked the Mos-induced, but not the p90Rsk-induced, pH(i) increase, suggesting that the Mos-MEK-MAPK-p90Rsk pathway promotes ApNHE3 activation. In a cell-free extract, the Mos-MEK-MAPK-p90Rsk pathway phosphorylates ApNHE3 at Ser-590, -606, and -673. When p90Rsk-dependent ApNHE3 phosphorylation was blocked by a dominant-negative C-terminal fragment, or neutralizing antibody, the p90Rsk-induced pH(i) increase was suppressed in immature oocytes. However, ApNHE3 is up-regulated via the upstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway before MAPK activation and the active state is maintained until spawning, suggesting that the p90Rsk-dependent ApNHE3 phosphorylation is unlikely to be the primary regulatory mechanism involved in MI arrest exit. After meiosis is completed, unfertilized eggs maintain their elevated pH(i) ( approximately 7.4) until the onset of apoptosis. We suggest that the p90Rsk/ApNHE3-dependent elevation of pH(i) increases fertilization success by delaying apoptosis initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2069926119,"Although closely related at the molecular level, the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of serotype 10F Streptococcus pneumoniae and coaggregation receptor polysaccharide (RPS) of Streptococcus oralis C104 have distinct ecological roles. CPS prevents phagocytosis of pathogenic S. pneumoniae, whereas RPS of commensal S. oralis functions as a receptor for lectin-like adhesins on other members of the dental plaque biofilm community. Results from high resolution NMR identified the recognition region of S. oralis RPS (i.e. Galfbeta1-6GalNAcbeta1-3Galalpha) in the hexasaccharide repeat of S. pneumoniae CPS10F. The failure of this polysaccharide to support fimbriae-mediated adhesion of Actinomyces naeslundii was explained by the position of Galf, which occurred as a branch in CPS10F rather than within the linear polysaccharide chain, as in RPS. Carbohydrate engineering of S. oralis RPS with wzy from S. pneumoniae attributed formation of the Galf branch in CPS10F to the linkage of adjacent repeating units through sub terminal GalNAc in Galfbeta1-6GalNAcbeta1-3Galalpha rather than through terminal Galf, as in RPS. A gene (wcrD) from serotype 10A S. pneumoniae was then used to engineer a linear surface polysaccharide in S. oralis that was identical to RPS except for the presence of a beta1-3 linkage between Galf and GalNAcbeta1-3Galalpha. This polysaccharide also failed to support adhesion of A. naeslundii, thereby establishing the essential role of beta1-6-linked Galf in recognition of adjacent GalNAcbeta1-3Galalpha in wild-type RPS. These findings, which illustrate a molecular approach for relating bacterial polysaccharide structure to function, provide insight into the possible evolution of S. oralis RPS from S. pneumoniae CPS."

EMDR was applied on autobiographic worries causing moderate distress. The EMDR session was complete in 5 out of the 7 cases; distress measured by SUDS (Subjective Units of Discomfort Scale) decreased to a near zero value. Smooth pursuit eye movements were recorded by an Eyelink II video system before and after EMDR. For the five complete sessions, pursuit eye movement improved after their EMDR session. Notably, the number of saccade intrusions—catch-up saccades (CUS)—decreased and, reciprocally, there was an increase in the smooth components of the pursuit. Such an increase in the smoothness of the pursuit presumably reflects an improvement in the use of visual attention needed to follow the target accurately. Perhaps EMDR reduces distress thereby activating a cholinergic effect known to improve ocular pursuit."

To decrypt the underlying mechanism, we used whole genome microarrays (Agilent 44K) to study epidermis gene expression in vivo in skin exposed to simulated solar radiation (SSR). We procured epidermis samples from healthy Caucasian patients, with phototypes II or III, and used two different SSR doses (2 and 4 J/cm2), the lower of which corresponded to the minimal erythemal dose. Analyses were carried out five hours after irradiation to identify early gene expression events in the photoprotective response. About 1.5% of genes from the human genome showed significant changes in gene expression. The annotations of these affected genes were assessed. They indicated a strengthening of the inflammation process and up-regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway and other pathways. Parallel to the p53 pathway, the p38 stress-responsive pathway was affected, supporting and mediating p53 function. We used an ex vivo assay with a specific inhibitor of p38 (SB203580) to investigate genes the expression of which was associated with active p38 kinase. We identified new direct p38 target genes and further characterized the role of p38. Our findings provide further insight into the physiological response to UV, including cell-cell interactions and cross-talk effects."

This leads to the activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. epidermal growth factor bovine serum albumin radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Recent studies have provided insight into the mechanism through which receptor dimerization leads to activation of the tyrosine kinase. Zhang et al. (12Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A.

Through mutational analysis, they demonstrated that the receiver kinase becomes activated as a result of asymmetric dimer formation. Subsequently, Thiel et al. (13Thiel K.W. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19238-19243Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) presented evidence that the intracellular juxtamembrane domain was involved in this allosteric activation of the EGF receptor kinase domain. The role of the juxtamembrane domain in dimer formation was clarified by Brewer et al. (14Red Brewer M. Choi S.H. Alvarado D. Moravcevic K. Pozzi A. Lemmon M.A. Carpenter G. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 641-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) who reported the crystal structure of an EGF receptor asymmetric kinase dimer that contained essentially all of the juxtamembrane domain. Their structure shows that the juxtamembrane domain of the receiver kinase forms a cradle or latch around the C-lobe of the activator kinase. Mutagenesis studies confirmed the importance of residues in the intracellular juxtamembrane domain for stabilization of the activating asymmetric kinase dimer. Jura et al. (15Jura N. Endres N.F.

By assaying several soluble, truncated forms of the intracellular kinase domain, they verified the importance of the juxtamembrane domain in kinase activation. Thus, it appears likely that tyrosine kinase activation in all ErbB family receptors occurs via formation of asymmetric dimers and involves interactions between the intracellular juxtamembrane domain of one monomer and residues in the C-lobe of the other kinase monomer. In their study, Jura et al. (15Jura N. Endres N.F. Engel K. Deindl S. Das R. Lamers M.H. Wemmer D.E. Zhang X. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2009; 137: 1293-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) also reported the crystal structure of a symmetric EGF receptor kinase dimer in which the kinase monomers are present in a head-to-head arrangement. They noted that the C-terminal residues in the symmetric dimer structure occupy the same position on the C-lobe of the kinase as residues in the juxtamembrane latch that stabilize the activating asymmetric dimer. Thus, for the activating asymmetric dimer to form, the AP-2 helix and the C-terminal tail must be displaced from their position in the symmetric dimer. We have recently used luciferase fragment complementation imaging in living cells to identify conformational changes in the EGF receptor that occur in response to ligand binding (8Yang K.S. Ilagan M.X. Piwnica-Worms D. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7474-7482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that full-length EGF receptors exist as inactive pre-dimers in which the C-terminal tails of the two receptor monomers are in close proximity. Ligand binding induces a conformational change that leads to separation of the C-terminal tails. Over time, this effect is reversed, and the receptors again adopt a conformation in which the C-terminal tails are close together. To investigate the structural basis of this conformational change, we made several mutations in the C-terminal tail of the EGF receptor, including the replacement of Asp-960 and Glu-961 with Ala. This mutation results in an EGF receptor kinase that is significantly more active than the wild-type receptor. Mutation of Ser-787, with which Asp-960 interacts, leads to a similar phenotype. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that Asp-960/Glu-961 represents a hinge or fulcrum for the movement of the C-terminal tail. Destabilization of this hinge by mutation of Asp-960/Glu-961 or Ser-787 facilitates displacement of the C-terminal tail by the juxtamembrane latch sequences, allowing easier conversion of the inactive symmetric dimer to the active asymmetric dimer. Murine EGF was purchased from Biomedical Technologies, Inc. and was dissolved in sterile water. U0126 (EMD Chemicals) was dissolved in DMSO. Doxycycline was from Clontech and was dissolved in sterile water. d-Luciferin (Biosynth) was dissolved in PBS and coelenterizine (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol. The MAP kinase and phosphospecific Thr-669 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology. The phosphospecific MAP kinase antibody was from Promega and the phosphotyrosine (PY20) antibody was from BD Biosciences. A mixture of EGF receptor antibodies from Cell Signaling and Santa Cruz Biotechnology was used to detect the EGF receptor. Pervanadate was generated by mixing equal concentrations of sodium orthovanadate and H2O2. The wild-type EGF receptor construct was subcloned from pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen) into pcDNA5/FRT (Invitrogen) using the NheI and HindIII restriction enzyme sites. The wild-type EGFR-NLuc/CLuc constructs were described previously (8Yang K.S. Ilagan M.X. Piwnica-Worms D. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7474-7482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)). Using the wild-type EGF receptor (pcDNA3.1(−)) as the template, QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to generate the D950A, D960A, E961A, D960A/E961A, and S787F mutants. Mutants were digested with the BstEII and HindIII restriction enzyme sites and were ligated into the wild-type EGF receptor construct (pcDNA5/FRT) cut with the same enzymes. All mutant constructs were sequenced in their entirety. The D950A/D960A/E961A triple mutant was generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis with the D960A/E961A-EGF receptor mutant (pcDNA3.1(−)) as the template. The D950A/D960A/E961A-EGF receptor pcDNA3.1(−) construct was subcloned into the wild-type pcDNA5/FRT construct using the BstEII and HindIII restriction sites and was sequenced. QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis was used to make the T669A-EGF receptor construct with the wild-type EGF receptor (pcDNA5/FRT) as the template. The mutant was digested with NheI and BstEII and was ligated into the wild-type EGF receptor pcDNA5/FRT plasmid cut with the same enzymes. The single point mutation was verified by sequencing. The T669A-CLuc construct was made using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis with the EGFR-CLuc (pcDNA6/V5-HisB) construct (8Yang K.S. Ilagan M.X. Piwnica-Worms D. Pike L.J. J. Biol.

The product was re-ligated into the same vector using the NheI and BsiWI restriction enzyme sites. T669A-NLuc was generated by restriction enzyme digest of the EGFR-NLuc pcDNA3.1TOPO construct with BstEII and KpnI, followed by ligation into the T669A-EGF receptor pcDNA5/FRT construct. The D960A/E961A-CLuc fusion construct was made by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis of EGFR-CLuc pcDNA6/V5-HisB (8Yang K.S. Ilagan M.X. Piwnica-Worms D. Pike L.J. J. Biol.

D960A/E961A-NLuc was made by digesting the D960A/E961A-CLuc construct with NheI and BsiWI, followed by ligation into the EGFR-NLuc pBI-Tet construct. The D960A/E961A-NLuc construct was then subcloned into the pcDNA5/FRT vector using the BstEII and EcoRV restriction enzyme sites. Flp-In CHO cells (Invitrogen) were co-transfected with pOG44 (Invitrogen) and the wild-type or mutant EGF receptors (pcDNA5/FRT) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable clones were isolated by selection in 600 μg/ml hygromycin (InvivoGen). Cells were maintained in F-12 containing 10% FetalPlex, 1000 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml hygromycin. CHO-K1 Tet-On cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FetalPlex, 1000 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml G418. The EGFR-NLuc/EGFR-CLuc, T669A-NLuc/T669A-CLuc, and D960A/E961A-NLuc/D960A/E961A-CLuc constructs were transiently transfected into CHO-K1 Tet-On cells 24 h prior to luciferase fragment complementation imaging using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells stably expressing EGFR-NLuc and EGFR-CLuc were maintained as previously described (8Yang K.S. Ilagan M.X. Piwnica-Worms D. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7474-7482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was determined by co-transfection of Renilla luciferase (pRLuc-N1, Packard Bioscience). CHO cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes. Cells were serum-starved in F-12 containing 1 mg/ml BSA for 2 h. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were then scraped into RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris pH 7.2, 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate, 1% Triton X-100, 17 mm deoxycholate, and 2.7 mm EDTA) containing 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein (BCA assay, Pierce) were loaded onto a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore). Western blots were blocked for 1 h in TBST/10% nonfat milk. The blots were incubated in primary antibody for 1 h (overnight at 4 °C for EGF receptor and phospho-Thr-669 antibodies), washed in TBST/0.1% BSA, incubated in secondary antibody for 45 min and washed three times in TBST/0.1% BSA. Western blots were detected using the Enhanced Chemiluminescent reagent from GE Healthcare. CHO cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes and serum-starved for 24 h in F-12 medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Monolayers were wounded with a sterile pipette tip, washed with Hanks balanced salt solution, photographed, and the media replaced with F-12 containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum without or with 1 nm EGF. Cultures were incubated for an additional 24 h, with photographs taken 12 h and 24 h post-EGF addition on a Zeiss LSM 510 ConfoCor 2 microscope. Cells were plated 48 h prior to use at 5 × 103 cells per well in growth media in a black wall 96-well plate. On the day of the assay, cells were serum-starved for 2 h and then incubated for 20 min in 175 μl of DMEM without phenol red, containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), and 0.6 mg/ml d-luciferin at 37 °C. To establish a baseline, cell radiance (photons/second/cm2/sr) was measured using a cooled CCD camera and imaging system at 37 °C (IVIS 50; Caliper) (30 s exposure; binning, 8; no filter; f-stop, 1; field of view, 12 cm). EGF was added in a volume of 25 μl in the same media (DMEM, 1 mg/ml BSA, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.6 mg/ml d-luciferin). Radiance was measured sequentially as described above. Transfection efficiency was assessed by monitoring Renilla luciferase expression. Media was replaced on cells with DMEM without phenol red containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 25 mm Hepes, (pH 7.2), and 400 nm coelenterazine. Radiance was immediately measured as described above except the filter was set to <510. Data were collected in quadruplicate for each condition. A flat-field correction was done to correct for differences in the baseline photon flux. Light production expressed as photon flux (photons/sec) was determined from regions-of-interest defined over wells using LIVINGIMAGE (Xenogen) and IGOR (Wavemetrics) software. Changes in photon flux were calculated by subtracting values observed in untreated cells from those of EGF-treated cells. Standard errors were determined using the formula for unpooled standard error. Our previous studies on ligand-induced conformational changes in the EGF receptor suggested that there was movement of both the kinase domain and the C-terminal tail (8Yang K.S. Ilagan M.X. Piwnica-Worms D. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7474-7482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In most EGF receptor kinase domain structures, ∼10–20 residues downstream of position 961 are missing from the structure (12Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J.

Kuriyan J. Nature. 2007; 450: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This suggests that this is a highly flexible region that might alter its position upon ligand binding. Residue 960 is an aspartic acid, and residue 961 is a glutamic acid. At least one acidic residue at either of these positions is conserved in all four ErbB family members (supplemental Table S1). To determine whether Asp-960 and/or Glu-961 were involved in EGF-induced conformational changes in the EGF receptor, the double point mutant, D960A/E961A-EGF receptor was constructed. The mutant was expressed in CHO cells, and its ability to undergo EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation was assessed. For comparison, cells expressing the T669A-EGF receptor were also analyzed. Thr-669 is phosphorylated by MAP kinase (21Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Wartmann M. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15266-15276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a modification that leads to desensitization of the receptor (22Li X. Huang Y. Jiang J. Frank S.J. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mutation of this residue blocks MAP kinase-dependent desensitization and enhances the activity of the kinase (22Li X. Huang Y. Jiang J. Frank S.J. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows the dose response to EGF in cells expressing similar levels of the wild type, T669A- and D960A/E961A-EGF receptors. EGF stimulated the phosphorylation of the receptor in all cell lines. As expected, autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor was substantially higher (∼4-fold) in cells expressing the T669A-EGF receptor, consistent with the hypothesis that it fails to undergo MAP kinase-dependent desensitization. Interestingly, the D960A/E961A-EGF receptor was also more highly phosphorylated (∼6-fold) than the wild type-EGF receptor. Immunoprecipitation of the EGF receptor confirmed that the bands phosphorylated in the cell lysates were indeed the EGF receptor (Fig. 1A, lower panel). To determine which residue contributed most to the observed phenotype, the D960A- and E961A-EGF receptor single point mutants were constructed and stably expressed in CHO cells. The effect of EGF on the activity of cells expressing wild type, D960A- or E961A-EGF receptors is shown in Fig. 1B. As before, treatment of cells expressing the wild-type EGF receptor led to tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor. Stimulation of cells expressing either the D960A-EGF receptor or the E961A-EGF receptor with EGF resulted in increased levels of receptor autophosphorylation as compared with the wild-type receptor. However, autophosphorylation was somewhat higher in the D960A-EGF receptor than in the E961A-EGF receptor. This suggests that while both residues are important, Asp-960 makes a larger contribution to the phenotype than does Glu-961. Because both residues appear to contribute to the phenotype, all further experiments were carried out with the D960A/E961A double point mutant. Cells expressing the wild-type-, T669A-, or D960A/E961A-EGF receptors were stimulated with 25 nm EGF for increasing lengths of time and then analyzed for the effect of the mutations on downstream signaling. As shown in Fig. 2, EGF stimulated MAP kinase activity to a similar extent in all three cell lines. Likewise, the EGF-stimulated activation of Akt was similar in all three lines. However, phosphorylation of Stat1 was markedly enhanced in cells expressing the T669A- and D960A/E961A-EGF receptors as compared with the wild-type receptor. The data in Fig. 3 show the effect of the EGF receptor mutations on the migration of cells into a scratch wound in a confluent monolayer of cells plated on fibronectin-coated dishes. Integrins are known to induce some of their biological effects by triggering the activation of the EGF receptor (23Marcoux N. Vuori K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6100-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Moro L. Dolce L. Cabodi S. Bergatto E. Boeri Erba E. Smeriglio M. Turco E. Retta S.F. Biuffrida M.G. Venturino M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Thus, an activated form of the EGF receptor would be expected to enhance cell migration both in the absence and presence of EGF. In the absence of EGF, cells expressing either wild-type or T669A-EGF receptors, showed relatively modest migration into the wound by 12 h, which was still incompletely filled by 24 h. By contrast, in cells expressing the D960A/E961A-EGF receptor, the scratch had significantly narrowed by 12 h and numerous cells had migrated into the center of the wound. By 24 h, the scratch was completely closed. Addition of EGF stimulated significant migration in all cell lines. However, cells expressing the D960A/E961A-EGF receptor showed a greater degree of wound closure after both 12 h and 24 h than did cells expressing either wild-type or T669A-EGF receptor. These data demonstrate that the D960A/E961A mutation results in a receptor with enhanced the ability to activate down stream signaling pathways and cellular level responses. We have previously used luciferase fragment complementation imaging to visualize conformational changes in the EGF receptor that occur in response to hormone binding (8Yang K.S. Ilagan M.X. Piwnica-Worms D. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7474-7482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this system, the N-terminal fragment of luciferase (NLuc) or the C-terminal fragment of luciferase (CLuc) are fused to the C terminus of the full-length EGF receptor. Complementation occurs when the fragments are in close proximity to each other and can reconstitute an active luciferase. Complementation declines when the fragments move apart from each other. The assay is done in intact cells under physiological conditions allowing real-time analysis of conformational changes in the EGF receptor. To compare the EGF-induced conformational changes in wild-type, T669A-, and D960A/E961A-EGF receptors, luciferase fragments were fused to the C termini of each receptor and the constructs stably expressed in CHO cells. Fig. 4, A and B show the results of a control experiment in which cells expressing the wild-type EGF receptor were stimulated with EGF. As previously reported (8Yang K.S. Ilagan M.X. Piwnica-Worms D. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7474-7482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a significant basal luciferase activity was observed, suggesting the presence of preformed dimers in unstimulated cells. Addition of EGF led to a rapid decrease in luciferase activity followed by a slow recovery back to baseline levels of light production. The results of luciferase fragment complementation imaging in the T669A-EGF receptor mutant are shown in Fig. 4, C and D. Like the wild-type receptor, the T669A-EGF receptor showed substantial basal luciferase activity. Similarly, addition of EGF induced a rapid decrease in luciferase activity (Fig. 4D). However, in contrast to what was seen with the wild-type EGF receptor, there was no recovery phase. Luciferase activity declined and did not regain its initial level. As shown in Fig. 4, E and F, the D960A/E961A-EGF receptor mutant exhibited the same pattern of luciferase fragment complementation as that seen in the T669A-EGF receptor. Specifically, EGF stimulated a rapid decline in luciferase activity, but there was no recovery back to baseline levels. These data suggest that the T669A- and D960A/E961A-EGF receptors share a common characteristic that leads to a similar pattern of ligand-induced changes in luciferase complementation that are different from those observed for the wild-type receptor. To further compare these two mutants, a time course of EGF-stimulated phosphorylation was performed. The data in Fig. 5A show that phosphorylation of the wild-type EGF receptor peaked ∼2 min after the addition of EGF and declined slightly thereafter. By contrast, maximal EGF-stimulated autophosphorylation of the T669A- and D960A/E961A-EGF receptors was ∼3-fold higher than that observed in the wild type receptor and was maintained at that high level over the 20 min time course (quantitated in Fig. 5B). Thus, in addition to similar behavior in the luciferase complementation assay, the two mutant receptors also share the characteristic of persistently elevated levels of receptor phosphorylation. The modest level of EGF receptor autophosphorylation in the wild-type receptor is due in part to the MAP kinase-dependent desensitization of the receptor (22Li X. Huang Y. Jiang J. Frank S.J. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Heisermann G.J. Wiley H.S. Walsh B.J. Ingraham H.A. Fiol C.J. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12820-12827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This reduces EGF-stimulated kinase activity and leads to lower net receptor phosphorylation due to dephosphorylation of the receptor by protein tyrosine phosphatases. Because the D960A/E961A-EGF receptor showed a phenotype similar to that of the T669A mutant, it was possible that the double point mutation might in some way inhibit the ability of MAP kinase to phosphorylate the EGF receptor on Thr-669 and desensitize its kinase activity. To assess this possibility, cells expressing wild-type, T669A-, or D960A/E961A-EGF receptors were treated without or with the MEK inhibitor, U0126, prior to stimulation by EGF to block the activation of MAP kinase. In the wild-type EGF receptor, stimulation with EGF resulted in receptor autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of the receptor on Thr-669 (Fig. 5C). Pretreatment with U0126 abolished phosphorylation of the receptor on Thr-669 and was associated with a 5-fold increase in EGF receptor autophosphorylation (quantitated in Fig. 5D). These data are consistent with the interpretation that phosphorylation of the EGF receptor by MAP kinase decreases activation of the EGF receptor kinase and indicate that this effect can be abolished by inhibiting MAP kinase activity. As expected, the T669A-EGF rec"
