https://openalex.org/W2071087800,"Herbivore attack is known to increase the emission of volatiles, which attract predators to herbivore-damaged plants in the laboratory and agricultural systems. We quantified volatile emissions from Nicotiana attenuata plants growing in natural populations during attack by three species of leaf-feeding herbivores and mimicked the release of five commonly emitted volatiles individually. Three compounds (cis-3-hexen-1-ol, linalool, and cis-alpha-bergamotene) increased egg predation rates by a generalist predator; linalool and the complete blend decreased lepidopteran oviposition rates. As a consequence, a plant could reduce the number of herbivores by more than 90% by releasing volatiles. These results confirm that indirect defenses can operate in nature."

This approach helps define a minimum feature set needed to separately control the sizes and shapes of nanocrystals. The resulting cobalt nanocrystals produce interesting two- and three-dimensional superstructures, including ribbons of nanorods."
https://openalex.org/W2039597975,"The molecular mechanism(s) that regulate apoptosis by caspase inhibition remain poorly understood. The main endogenous inhibitors are members of the IAP family and are exemplified by XIAP, which regulates the initiator caspase-9, and the executioner caspases-3 and -7. We report the crystal structure of the second BIR domain of XIAP (BIR2) in complex with caspase-3, at a resolution of 2.7 A, revealing the structural basis for inhibition. The inhibitor makes limited contacts through its BIR domain to the surface of the enzyme, and most contacts to caspase-3 originate from the N-terminal extension. This lies across the substrate binding cleft, but in reverse orientation compared to substrate binding. The mechanism of inhibition is due to a steric blockade prohibitive of substrate binding, and is distinct from the mechanism utilized by synthetic substrate analog inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2127883090,"The dissociation of a water molecule in liquid water is the fundamental event in acid-base chemistry, determining the pH of water. Because of the short time scales and microscopic length scales involved, the dynamics of this autoionization have not been directly probed by experiment. Here, the autoionization mechanism is revealed by sampling and analyzing ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories. We identify the rare fluctuations in solvation energies that destabilize an oxygen-hydrogen bond. Through the transfer of protons along a hydrogen bond ""wire,"" the nascent ions separate by three or more neighbors. If the hydrogen bond wire connecting the two ions is subsequently broken, a metastable charge-separated state is visited. The ions may then diffuse to large separations. If, however, the hydrogen bond wire remains unbroken, the ions recombine rapidly. Because of their concomitant large electric fields, the transient ionic species produced in this case may provide an experimentally detectable signal of the dynamics we report."
https://openalex.org/W2118128673,A novel family of candidate gustatory receptors (GRs) was recently identified in searches of the Drosophila genome. We have performed in situ hybridization and transgene experiments that reveal expression of these genes in both gustatory and olfactory neurons in adult flies and larvae. This gene family is likely to encode both odorant and taste receptors. We have visualized the projections of chemosensory neurons in the larval brain and observe that neurons expressing different GRs project to discrete loci in the antennal lobe and subesophageal ganglion. These data provide insight into the diversity of chemosensory recognition and an initial view of the representation of gustatory information in the fly brain.
https://openalex.org/W2111663819,"Chloroplasts relocate their positions in a cell in response to the intensity of incident light, moving to the side wall of the cell to avoid strong light, but gathering at the front face under weak light to maximize light interception. Here, Arabidopsis thaliana mutants defective in the avoidance response were isolated, and the mutated gene was identified as NPL1 (NPH-like 1), a homolog of NPH1 (nonphototropic hypocotyl 1), a blue light receptor used in phototropism. Hence, NPL1 is likely a blue light receptor regulating the avoidance response under strong light."
https://openalex.org/W2112228116,"A rotaxane is described in which a macrocycle moves reversibly between two hydrogen-bonding stations after a nanosecond laser pulse. Observation of transient changes in the optical absorption spectrum after photoexcitation allows direct quantitative monitoring of the submolecular translational process. The rate of shuttling was determined and the influence of the surrounding medium was studied: At room temperature in acetonitrile, the photoinduced movement of the macrocycle to the second station takes about 1 microsecond and, after charge recombination (about 100 microseconds), the macrocycle shuttles back to its original position. The process is reversible and cyclable and has properties characteristic of an energy-driven piston."
https://openalex.org/W2144841919,"The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins suppress cell death by inhibiting the catalytic activity of caspases. Here we present the crystal structure of caspase-7 in complex with a potent inhibitory fragment from XIAP at 2.45 A resolution. An 18-residue XIAP peptide binds the catalytic groove of caspase-7, making extensive contacts to the residues that are essential for its catalytic activity. Strikingly, despite a reversal of relative orientation, a subset of interactions between caspase-7 and XIAP closely resemble those between caspase-7 and its tetrapeptide inhibitor DEVD-CHO. Our biochemical and structural analyses reveal that the BIR domains are dispensable for the inhibition of caspase-3 and -7. This study provides a structural basis for the design of the next-generation caspase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2036868716,"We characterize a novel hemocyte-specific acute phase glycoprotein from the malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae. It shows substantial structural and functional similarities, including the highly conserved thioester motif, to both a central component of mammalian complement system, factor C3, and to a pan-protease inhibitor, alpha2-macroglobulin. Most importantly, this protein serves as a complement-like opsonin and promotes phagocytosis of some Gram-negative bacteria in a mosquito hemocyte-like cell line. Chemical inactivation by methylamine and depletion by double-stranded RNA knockout demonstrate that this function is dependent on the internal thioester bond. This evidence of a complement-like function in a protostome animal adds substantially to the accumulating evidence of a common ancestry of immune defenses in insects and vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2153111398,"Transcriptional induction by interferons requires the tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors. The N-terminal region is highly homologous among the STAT proteins and surrounds a completely conserved arginine residue. Here we demonstrate arginine methylation of STAT1 by the protein arginine methyl-transferase PRMT1 as a novel requirement for IFNalpha/beta-induced transcription. Methyl-thioadenosine, a methyl-transferase inhibitor that accumulates in many transformed cells, inhibits STAT1-mediated IFN responses. This inhibition arises from impaired STAT1-DNA binding due to an increased association of the STAT inhibitor PIAS1 with phosphorylated STAT1 dimers in the absence of arginine methylation. Thus, arginine methylation of STAT1 is an additional posttranslational modification regulating transcription factor function, and alteration of arginine methylation might be responsible for the lack of interferon responsiveness observed in many malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2093906292,"The threshold for hippocampal-dependent synaptic plasticity and memory storage is thought to be determined by the balance between protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mediated by the kinase PKA and the phosphatase calcineurin. To establish whether endogenous calcineurin acts as an inhibitory constraint in this balance, we examined the effect of genetically inhibiting calcineurin on plasticity and memory. Using the doxycycline-dependent rtTA system to express a calcineurin inhibitor reversibly in the mouse brain, we find that the transient reduction of calcineurin activity facilitates LTP in vitro and in vivo. This facilitation is PKA dependent and persists over several days in vivo. It is accompanied by enhanced learning and strengthened short- and long-term memory in several hippocampal-dependent spatial and nonspatial tasks. The LTP and memory improvements are reversed fully by suppression of transgene expression. These results demonstrate that endogenous calcineurin constrains LTP and memory."
https://openalex.org/W2064282853,"The relationship of the classical receptors and their transcriptional activity to nongenotropic effects of steroid hormones is unknown. We demonstrate herein a novel paradigm of sex steroid action on osteoblasts, osteocytes, embryonic fibroblasts, and HeLa cells involving activation of a Src/Shc/ERK signaling pathway and attenuating apoptosis. This action is mediated by the ligand binding domain and eliminated by nuclear targeting of the receptor protein; ERalpha, ERbeta, or AR can transmit it with similar efficiency irrespective of whether the ligand is an estrogen or an androgen. This antiapoptotic action can be dissociated from the transcriptional activity of the receptor with synthetic ligands, providing proof of principle for the development of function-specific-as opposed to tissue-selective-and gender-neutral pharmacotherapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2064596479,"We report on the direct measurement of the dynamics of water molecules in the solvation shell of an ion in aqueous solution. The hydrogen-bond dynamics of water molecules solvating a Cl − , Br − , or I − anion is slow compared with neat liquid water, indicating that the aqueous solvation shells of these ions are rigid. This rigidity can play an important role in the overall dynamics of chemical reactions in aqueous solution. The experiments were performed with femtosecond midinfrared nonlinear spectroscopy, because this technique allows the spectral response of the water molecules in the solvation shell to be distinguished clearly from that of the other water molecules in the solution."
https://openalex.org/W1993906107,"The role of NF-κB–inducing kinase (NIK) in cytokine signaling remains controversial. To identify the physiologic functions of NIK, we disrupted the NIK locus by gene targeting. Although NIK –/– mice displayed abnormalities in both lymphoid tissue development and antibody responses, NIK –/– cells manifested normal NF-κB DNA binding activity when treated with a variety of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and lymphotoxin-β (LTβ). However, NIK was selectively required for gene transcription induced through ligation of LTβ receptor but not TNF receptors. These results reveal that NIK regulates the transcriptional activity of NF-κB in a receptor-restricted manner."
https://openalex.org/W2078290278,"Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes, like those of most animals, arrest during meiotic prophase. Sperm promote the resumption of meiosis (maturation) and contraction of smooth muscle-like gonadal sheath cells, which are required for ovulation. We show that the major sperm cytoskeletal protein (MSP) is a bipartite signal for oocyte maturation and sheath contraction. MSP also functions in sperm locomotion, playing a role analogous to actin. Thus, during evolution, MSP has acquired extracellular signaling and intracellular cytoskeletal functions for reproduction. Proteins with MSP-like domains are found in plants, fungi, and other animals, suggesting that related signaling functions may exist in other phyla."
https://openalex.org/W2063587189,"The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) that activates human gp130. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral IL-6 and human gp130, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of gp130 and site III of viral IL-6, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human IL-6 (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact gp130, which enhances the complementarity of the viral IL-6-gp130 binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of gp130 is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic gp130 cytokine-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2127292022,"The Drosophila compound eye is specified by the concerted action of seven nuclear factors that include Eyeless/Pax6. These factors have been called ""master control"" proteins because loss-of-function mutants lack eyes and ectopic expression can direct ectopic eye development. However, inactivation of these genes does not cause the presumptive eye to change identity. Surprisingly, we find that several of these eye specification genes are not coexpressed in the same embryonic cells-or even in the presumptive eye. We demonstrate that the EGF Receptor and Notch signaling pathways have homeotic functions that are genetically upstream of the eye specification genes, and show that specification occurs much later than previously thought-not during embryonic development but in the second larval stage."

During intense fires over Indonesia (August to November 1997), ozone plumes, decoupled from the smoke below, extended as far as India. This ozone overlay a regional ozone increase triggered by atmospheric responses to the El Niño and Indian Ocean Dipole. Tropospheric ozone and smoke aerosol measurements from the Nimbus 7 TOMS instrument show El Niño signals but no tropospheric ozone trend in the 1980s. Offsets between smoke and ozone seasonal maxima point to multiple factors determining tropical tropospheric ozone variability."
https://openalex.org/W1995987769,"The mRNA polyadenylation factor CstF interacts with the BRCA1-associated protein BARD1, and this interaction represses the nuclear mRNA polyadenylation machinery in vitro. Given the suspected role of BRCA1/BARD1 in DNA repair, we tested whether inhibition of mRNA processing is linked to DNA damage. Strikingly, we found that 3' cleavage in extracts from cells treated with hydroxyurea or ultraviolet light was strongly, but transiently, inhibited. Although no changes were detected in CstF, BARD1, and BRCA1 protein levels, increased amounts of a CstF/BARD1/BRCA1 complex were detected. Supporting the physiological significance of these results, a previously identified tumor-associated germline mutation in BARD1 (Gln564His) reduced binding to CstF and abrogated inhibition of polyadenylation. Together these results indicate a link between mRNA 3' processing and DNA repair and tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2087669983,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) adenosine triphosphatases actively transport a wide variety of compounds across biological membranes. Here, the ABC protein Mdl1 was identified as an intracellular peptide transporter localized in the inner membrane of yeast mitochondria. Mdl1 was required for mitochondrial export of peptides with molecular masses of approximately 2100 to 600 daltons generated by proteolysis of inner-membrane proteins by the m-AAA protease in the mitochondrial matrix. Proteolysis by the i-AAA protease in the intermembrane space led to the release of similar-sized peptides independent of Mdl1. Thus, two pathways of peptide efflux from mitochondria exist that may allow communication between mitochondria and their cellular environment."
https://openalex.org/W2000882936,"The tropical ocean plays a major role in global climate. It is therefore crucial to establish the precise phase between tropical and high-latitude climate variability during past abrupt climate events in order to gain insight into the mechanisms of global climate change. Here we present alkenone sea surface temperature (SST) records from the tropical South China Sea that show an abrupt temperature increase of at least 1 degrees C at the end of the last glacial period. Within the recognized dating uncertainties, this SST increase is synchronous with the Bølling warming observed at 14.6 thousand years ago in the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 ice core."
https://openalex.org/W2046666752,"The number of cells in developing organs must be controlled spatially by extracellular signals. Our results show how cell number can be regulated by cell interactions controlling proliferation and survival in local neighborhoods in the case of the Drosophila compound eye. Intercellular signals act during the second mitotic wave, a cell cycle that generates a pool of uncommitted cells used for most ommatidial fates. We find that G1/S progression to start the cell cycle requires EGF receptor inactivity. EGF receptor activation is then required for progression from G2 to M phase of the same cells, and also prevents apoptosis. EGF receptor activation depends on short-range signals from five-cell preclusters of photoreceptor neurons not participating in the second mitotic wave. Through proliferation and survival control, such signals couple the total number of uncommitted cells being generated to the neural patterning of the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2119051032,"The organization of neuronal systems is often dependent on activity and competition between cells. In olfaction, the X-linked OCNC1 channel subunit is subject to random inactivation and is essential for odorant-evoked activity. Reporter-tagged OCNC1 mutant mice permit the visualization of OCNC1-deficient olfactory neurons and their projections. In heterozygous females, X inactivation creates a mosaic with two populations of genetically distinct neurons. OCNC1-deficient neurons are slowly and specifically depleted from the olfactory epithelium and display unusual patterns of projection to the olfactory bulb. Remarkably, this depletion is dependent on odorant exposure and is reversed by odorant deprivation. This suggests that odorants and the activity they evoke are critical for neuronal survival in a competitive environment and implicate evoked activity in the organization and maintenance of the olfactory system."

In reactions reconstituted with uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease and DNA ligase I, pol iota can use its dRP lyase and polymerase activities to repair G*U and A*U pairs in DNA. These data and three distinct catalytic properties of pol iota implicate it in specialized forms of base excision repair (BER)."
https://openalex.org/W2135603829,"The inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) represent the only endogenous caspase inhibitors and are characterized by the presence of baculoviral IAP repeats (BIRs). Here, we report the crystal structure of the complex between human caspase-7 and XIAP (BIR2 and the proceeding linker). The structure surprisingly reveals that the linker is the only contacting element for the caspase, while the BIR2 domain is invisible in the crystal. The linker interacts with and blocks the substrate groove of the caspase in a backward fashion, distinct from substrate recognition. Structural analyses suggest that the linker is the energetic and specificity determinant of the interaction. Further biochemical characterizations clearly establish that the linker harbors the major energetic determinant, while the BIR2 domain serves as a regulatory element for caspase binding and Smac neutralization."
https://openalex.org/W2067263369,"Little is known about how patterns of cell types are organized to form brain structures of appropriate size and shape. To study this process, we employed in vivo electroporation during midbrain development to create ectopic sources of Sonic Hedgehog, a signaling molecule previously shown to specify different neuronal cell types in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. We provide direct evidence that a Sonic Hedgehog source can control pattern at a distance in brain development and demonstrate that the size, shape, and orientation of the cell populations produced depend on the geometry of the morphogen source. Thus, a single regulatory molecule can coordinate tissue size and shape with cell-type identity in brain development."

Several components, including molecular chaperones and folding enzymes that mediate these processes, have been identified in the ER. Shortage or defects of these components as well as mutations in secretory proteins and environmental stress tend to result in failure and therefore misfolding of secretory proteins. The misfolded proteins are retained in the ER and are subjected to retrial for correct maturation with the aid of molecular chaperones and folding enzymes. However if this process is not successful, prolonged retention of the misfolded proteins in the ER eventually leads to their degradation (3Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev.

In yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, slow removal of α1,2-mannose from the middle branch of the protein-bound oligosaccharide, or formation of Man8GlcNAc2, has been shown to be critical for the degradation of misfolded carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), a vacuolar glycoprotein (10Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the reports that inhibition of α-mannosidase trimming stabilizes specific misfolded glycoproteins in the mammalian ER (11Su K. Stoller T. Rocco J. Zemsky J. Green R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14301-14309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations, it has been proposed that the trimming of the glycoprotein-bound oligosaccharide may well function as the biological timer for the onset of the glycoprotein degradation that prevents permanent residence of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER (2Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). This naturally suggests the presence of a Man8GlcNAc2-binding lectin involved in ERAD of misfolded glycoproteins, which remains to be identified (10Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).In the present study, we identified a new α-mannosidase-like protein, Mnl1p (mannosidase-like protein), in the yeast ER. Although it shows some homology with Mns1p, yeast α1,2-mannosidase, Mnl1p is unlikely to exhibit the α1,2-mannosidase activity, because it lacks cysteine residues that are essential for the α1,2-mannosidase activity (13Lipari F. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27615-27622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However deletion of theMNL1 gene resulted in retardation of the degradation of misfolded CPY, but not of the unglycosylated mutant form of the yeast α-mating pheromone (ΔGpαF). Possible roles of Mnl1p in ERAD and the ER retention of misfolded glycoproteins will be discussed.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have characterized the functions of Mnl1p, an α-mannosidase-like protein in the ER. Deletion of theMNL1 gene led to retardation of ERAD of CPY*, a misfolded glycoprotein, but not of ΔGpαF, a misfolded unglycosylated protein, suggesting that Mnl1p plays important roles in ERAD of misfolded proteins with N-linked oligosaccharides. Then what is the role of Mnl1p in ERAD? The lack of two cysteine residues strongly suggests that Mnl1p does not have the α-mannosidase activity. Mnl1p may be involved in the recognition of oligosaccharide structures, including Man8GlcNAc2, which is essential for ERAD substrates, of misfolded proteins. Indeed, a recently identified mammalian counterpart of Mnl1p does not have the mannosidase activity and probably functions as a lectin that specifically recognizes the oligosaccharide structure of Man8GlcNAc2 (34Hosokawa, N., Wada, I., Hasegawa, K., Yorihuzi, T., Tremblay, L. O., Herscovics, A., and Nagata, K. (2001) EMBO Rep., in press.Google Scholar).The fate of CPY* was followed in detail when its degradation was impaired by the deletion of the MNL1 gene. Whereas CPY* was partly retained as p1CPY*, the ER form to be degraded, a part of p1CPY* molecules were converted to the early-Golgi form, p1′CPY*, containing α1→6 mannose. This indicates that at least some p1CPY* was released from the ER to the Golgi complex. However, since α1→3 mannose was not attached to p1′CPY* even after the prolonged chase, CPY* most likely undergoes recycling through the early-Golgi cisternae into the ER. Deletion of DER1 encoding an ER protein involved in ERAD also leads to escape of some CPY* from the ER for the early-Golgi compartment (33Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Therefore ER-resident proteins that are involved in ERAD are also responsible for retaining their substrates in the ER probably by their affinity for misfolded proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 is the site of entry for proteins destined for the secretory pathway. The ER provides an optimized environment for correct maturation, including correct folding, oligomerization, N- and O-linked glycosylation, and disulfide bond formation of proteins imported into the ER (1Hammond C.

This is consistent with the reports that inhibition of α-mannosidase trimming stabilizes specific misfolded glycoproteins in the mammalian ER (11Su K. Stoller T. Rocco J. Zemsky J. Green R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14301-14309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations, it has been proposed that the trimming of the glycoprotein-bound oligosaccharide may well function as the biological timer for the onset of the glycoprotein degradation that prevents permanent residence of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER (2Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). This naturally suggests the presence of a Man8GlcNAc2-binding lectin involved in ERAD of misfolded glycoproteins, which remains to be identified (10Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified a new α-mannosidase-like protein, Mnl1p (mannosidase-like protein), in the yeast ER. Although it shows some homology with Mns1p, yeast α1,2-mannosidase, Mnl1p is unlikely to exhibit the α1,2-mannosidase activity, because it lacks cysteine residues that are essential for the α1,2-mannosidase activity (13Lipari F. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27615-27622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However deletion of theMNL1 gene resulted in retardation of the degradation of misfolded CPY, but not of the unglycosylated mutant form of the yeast α-mating pheromone (ΔGpαF). Possible roles of Mnl1p in ERAD and the ER retention of misfolded glycoproteins will be discussed. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have characterized the functions of Mnl1p, an α-mannosidase-like protein in the ER. Deletion of theMNL1 gene led to retardation of ERAD of CPY*, a misfolded glycoprotein, but not of ΔGpαF, a misfolded unglycosylated protein, suggesting that Mnl1p plays important roles in ERAD of misfolded proteins with N-linked oligosaccharides. Then what is the role of Mnl1p in ERAD? The lack of two cysteine residues strongly suggests that Mnl1p does not have the α-mannosidase activity. Mnl1p may be involved in the recognition of oligosaccharide structures, including Man8GlcNAc2, which is essential for ERAD substrates, of misfolded proteins. Indeed, a recently identified mammalian counterpart of Mnl1p does not have the mannosidase activity and probably functions as a lectin that specifically recognizes the oligosaccharide structure of Man8GlcNAc2 (34Hosokawa, N., Wada, I., Hasegawa, K., Yorihuzi, T., Tremblay, L. O., Herscovics, A., and Nagata, K. (2001) EMBO Rep., in press.Google Scholar).The fate of CPY* was followed in detail when its degradation was impaired by the deletion of the MNL1 gene. Whereas CPY* was partly retained as p1CPY*, the ER form to be degraded, a part of p1CPY* molecules were converted to the early-Golgi form, p1′CPY*, containing α1→6 mannose. This indicates that at least some p1CPY* was released from the ER to the Golgi complex. However, since α1→3 mannose was not attached to p1′CPY* even after the prolonged chase, CPY* most likely undergoes recycling through the early-Golgi cisternae into the ER. Deletion of DER1 encoding an ER protein involved in ERAD also leads to escape of some CPY* from the ER for the early-Golgi compartment (33Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Therefore ER-resident proteins that are involved in ERAD are also responsible for retaining their substrates in the ER probably by their affinity for misfolded proteins.

The NdeI toBamHI fragment encoding full-length BMK1(AEF) was fused in frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain of pGBKT7 (CLONTECH) to create BD/BMK1(AEF). A human epithelial carcinoma cDNA library was separately fused with the GAL4 activation domain (AD) of the vector pGAD-GH (CLONTECH). The yeast strain PJ69-2A was co-transformed with this library along with BD/BMK1(AEF), and transformed yeast were screened for their ability to grow on plates lacking histidine and adenine according to the supplier's protocols. A full-length cDNA encoding human SGK was obtained from The Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genome and Their Expression (IMAGE) Consortium (clone ID 42669) and was cloned, in frame with the GST sequence, into the mammalian expression vector pEBG (18Sanchez I.

Activated FLAG-BMK1 protein was purified from HEK 293T cell extracts using anti-FLAG (M2) antibody gel (Sigma) and eluted in kinase buffer containing flag peptide (1 mg/ml). Wild type and mutant GST-SGK proteins were similarly expressed in HEK 293T cells and affinity purified from cell extracts using glutathione-Sepharose beads. Purified GST-SGK proteins were dephosphorylated by incubation with 10 ng of protein phosphatase 2A (Calbiochem) in 50 μl of 20 mmTris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of 1 μm microcystin-LR (Calbiochem). The dephosphorylated GST-SGK protein was then mixed with eluted FLAG-BMK1 in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and 500 μm ATP. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the glutathione-Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation. Kinase assays were performed in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and [γ-32P]ATP (1000–2000 cpm/pmol) and 1 mmcrosstide (GRPRTSSFAEG) as substrate. After incubating for 30 min at 30 °C, the kinase reaction was spotted on Whatman phosphocellulose paper, precipitated with 75 mm phosphoric acid, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Wild type or S78A SGK proteins was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with protein phosphatase 2A (Calbiochem) and followed by the addition of microcystin-LR to 1 μm to inactivate protein phosphatase 2A. These SGK proteins were then incubated with activated GST-BMK1 and [γ-32P]ATP (2000 cpm/pmol) for 30 min at 30 °C as described in the previous section. The reactions were stopped after 30 min by the addition of SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) and 1% (v/v), respectively, followed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. These samples were then incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with 2% (v/v) 4-vinylpyridine, separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose to isolate 32P-labeled SGK proteins. Phosphopeptide and Phosphoamino acid analysis of these32P-SGK proteins was performed as described previously (8Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D.

After 15 h, the percentage of cells in S phase was measured in triplicate by adding 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) directly to the culture medium for 45 min. The cells were then harvested, stained with both propidium iodide and anti-bromodeoxyuridine fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the fraction of cells in S phase was determined by flow cytometry as described previously (10Kato Y.

BMK1, a recently identified mammalian MAP kinase, is activated by diverse stimuli, including hydrogen peroxide, hyperosmotic stress, and serum factors such as EGF (8Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V.

The growth factor-induced activation of BMK1 proceeds through a MAP kinase signaling cascade involving the upstream kinases MEKK3 and MEK5 (11Chao T.H. Hayashi M. Tapping R.I. Kato Y. Lee J.D. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). To identify downstream targets of BMK1 activity, a dominant negative form of BMK1, in which the catalytic TEY site has been mutated to AEF (8Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), was used as bait in a yeast two hybrid screen. A total of 2 × 107 transformants were screened from a human epithelial carcinoma cDNA library, and 83 positive clones were selected for sequence analysis based on their potential interaction with BMK1. Using the BLAST algorithm and the nucleotide data base at the National Library of Medicine, two clones were found to encode carboxyl-terminal portions of the molecule SGK (Fig.1 A). As shown, the growth of transformed yeast in media lacking histidine and adenine is completely dependent on the presence of sequences from both SGK and BMK1(AEF) in this GAL4 system. One of the clones encodes only the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids of SGK, indicating that this small portion of the kinase is sufficient for its interaction with BMK1. To verify that BMK1 and SGK interact, GST-tagged portions of SGK were expressed in HEK 293T cells along with FLAG-tagged BMK1(AEF). After transfection, cell lysates were prepared, and glutathione-Sepharose was used to affinity purify GST-tagged SGK proteins. BMK1 and SGK co-purified in this system, and this interaction was dependent upon the presence of amino acid residues 401–431 of SGK (Fig. 1 C). These results support the findings from the yeast two-hybrid screen and confirm that the COOH-terminal 30 amino acids of SGK are sufficient for its physical interaction with BMK1 in mammalian cells. To identify putative site(s) in SGK that are phosphorylated by BMK1, we individually mutated the five consensus MAP kinase phosphorylation sites (Ser/Thr followed by Pro) in SGK to alanine at positions Ser74, Ser78, Thr260, Ser369, and Ser401. All of the mutants, except SGK(S78A), were substrates for BMK1 in an in vitroprotein kinase assay, indicating that Ser78 is the site in SGK that is phosphorylated by BMK1 (Fig.2 A). In agreement with this, tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of wild type SGK protein treatedin vitro with BMK1 revealed one phosphorylated peptide that only contained phosphoserine upon subsequent phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, this radioactive tryptic peptide was not detected when the mutant SGK(S78A) was used as a BMK1 substrate. These data demonstrate that BMK1 phosphorylates serine 78 of SGK in vitro. We next examined the effect of BMK1-mediated phosphorylation on the kinase activity of SGK. Although the downstream cellular targets of SGK are currently unknown, a peptide substrate of RAC protein kinase, known as crosstide, has been shown to be a substrate for SGK (21Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). To assess the activity of the SGK mutants in response to activated BMK1, we used crosstide in a coupled in vitro protein kinase assay. The activity of all of the SGK mutants was up-regulated 5-fold by BMK1 with the exception of SGK(S78A) whose activity was unaffected (Fig. 2 D). These results show that SGK is activated by BMK1-induced phosphorylation at Ser78. As EGF has been shown to be a potent stimulus for BMK1 (10Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), we evaluated the cellular phosphorylation of SGK as a result of EGF stimulation. To this end, HeLa cells expressing GST-tagged SGK were labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate and treated with EGF. One EGF-inducible phosphopeptide was detected by tryptic peptide mapping (Fig.3 A). To confirm that the phosphorylation of SGK obtained in vivo and in vitro is identical, we mixed equal radiolabeled counts of SGK from these two sources followed by phosphopeptide mapping. The identical migration of the induced phosphopeptide in the mixture confirmed that SGK is phosphorylated at the same site both in vivo andin vitro. This EGF-induced phosphopeptide was absent when SGK(S78A) was expressed in this experiment, confirming that thein vivo phosphorylation site of SGK is indeed Ser78 (Fig. 3 A). In agreement with this, subsequent phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that the EGF-inducible phosphopeptide of wild type SGK obtained in vivo contained only phosphoserine (Fig. 3 B). The above findings prompted us to evaluate SGK kinase activity as a result of EGF-mediated cell stimulation. EGF induced the kinase activity of wild type SGK about 3-fold but had no effect on the activity of SGK(S78A) (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that phosphorylation of Ser78 is necessary for growth factor-induced activation of SGK. To confirm that the observed cellular activation of SGK is mediated by BMK1, we tested the effects of dominant negative forms of the MAP kinases BMK1 and p38, BMK1(AEF) and p38(APF), on EGF-induced SGK activation. BMK1(AEF), but not p38(APF), completely abrogated EGF-induced cellular activation of SGK (Fig.3 D). Together, these results confirm a critical role for BMK1 in EGF-induced cellular activation of SGK. We have shown previously that BMK1 activity is required for growth factor-mediated cell proliferation and progression into the S phase of the cell cycle (10Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that SGK, as a downstream substrate of BMK1, is involved in mediating this cellular function of BMK1. To test this, MCF10A cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing SGK(S78A), starved in growth factor-deficient medium for 48 h, stimulated with growth factors, and assayed for cell cycle progression 15 h later. The addition of growth factors to both mock and control virus-infected cells caused the fraction of cells in S phase to increase from about 7 to 40% (Fig.4A). In contrast, expression of SGK(S78A) prevented cells from entering S phase following the addition of growth factors. These results demonstrate that the BMK1-induced activation of SGK is required for mammalian cells to enter the S phase of the cell cycle in response to growth factors. Previous studies in our laboratory have established that BMK1 is required for growth factor-induced cell proliferation and cell cycle progression (10Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Herein, we identify SGK as a direct downstream substrate of BMK1 and show that upon EGF stimulation BMK1 activates SGK through phosphorylation of Ser78. Moreover, we demonstrate that Ser78 of SGK is required for growth factor-induced cell cycle progression, a finding that strongly suggests that BMK1-mediated regulation of SGK activity is critical for this cellular response. Interestingly, others have shown that SGK actively shuttles in synchrony with the cell cycle between the cytoplasm (in G1 phase) and the nucleus (in S and G2/M phase) of the cell (17Buse P. Tran S.H. Luther E. Phu P.T. Aponte G.W. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7253-7263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have found that upon activation, BMK1 actively accumulates in the nucleus of the cell (8Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that these kinases are co-localized during cell cycle progression through the physical association of BMK1 with the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids of SGK. Members of the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK) family have been shown to phosphorylate residues within the activation loop of the conserved catalytic domain of protein kinase B, ribosomal protein S6 kinase, and protein kinase Cζ (22Chou M.M.

Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Given that the catalytic domain of SGK is homologous to that of these PDK targets (12Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), SGK was suspected to be a target of PDK phosphorylation. Indeed, two recent studies have reported that the PDKs phosphorylate SGK at Thr256, which resides in the activation loop of the catalytic domain of this kinase (21Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 25Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). However, in these studies mutagenesis of Thr256 did not abrogate the total cellular phosphorylation of SGK, suggesting the existence of other phosphorylation sites within this kinase (25Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Herein, we show that SGK is a downstream target of the MAP kinase family member BMK1. In contrast to PDK, changing Thr256 to alanine does not alter the BMK1-induced activation of SGK (Fig. 2 D). Conversely, we have shown that changing Ser78 to alanine abrogates the phosphorylation of SGK by BMK1 (Fig. 2 D). We have found that the S78A mutation has no effect on PDK-mediated phosphorylation of SGK and have confirmed that the T256A mutation abrogates this event (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that PDK1 and BMK1 can independently regulate SGK activity through the phosphorylation of two entirely different sites. It is noteworthy that although Ser78 is located outside the catalytic domain of SGK, there are other examples of kinase activation as a result of phosphorylation outside the catalytic region (26Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidada H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 27Brushia R.J. Walsh D.A. Front Biosci. 1999; 4: D618-D641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, SGK appears to be a point of convergence for at least two different signaling pathways. Given the fact that SGK activity is induced by a wide variety of cellular stimuli, it is not surprising that this kinase is regulated by more than one upstream pathway. In this regard, the PDK- and BMK1-mediated activation of SGK need not be mutually exclusive and may in fact act together to coordinate the appropriate activation of SGK under certain physiologic conditions. Until natural cellular substrates for SGK are identified, the mechanism by which the BMK1-induced activation of SGK mediates cell cycle progression in response to growth factors will remain an important area of future investigation."

In vitro, N-CoR can interact with the Sin3 corepressor, which in turn binds to the histone deacetylase Rpd3 (HDAC1), predicting the existence of a corepressor complex containing N-CoR, Sin3, and histone deacetylase. However, previous biochemical studies of endogenous Sin3 complexes have failed to find an N-CoR association. Xenopus laevis eggs and oocytes contain all of the necessary components for transcriptional repression by unliganded TRs. In this study, we report the biochemical fractionation of three novel macromolecular complexes containing N-CoR, two of which possess histone deacetylase activity, fromXenopus egg extract. One complex contains Sin3, Rpd3, and RbAp48; the second complex contains a Sin3-independent histone deacetylase; and the third complex lacks histone deacetylase activity. This study describes the first biochemical isolation of endogenous N-CoR-containing HDAC complexes and illustrates that N-CoR associates with distinct histone deacetylases that are both dependent and independent of Sin3. Immunoprecipitation studies show that N-CoR binds to unliganded TR expressed in the frog oocyte, confirming that N-CoR complexes are involved in repression by unliganded TR.

This work suggested that N-CoR-mediated repression occurs through Sin3 recruitment of the Sin3-associated histone deacetylase Rpd3 (HDAC1), though an endogenous Sin3-containing N-CoR complex has never been described to date. However, recent work provides evidence that N-CoR can associate directly with HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC3, whereas SMRT can form a complex with HDAC5 and HDAC7, or with HDAC3 (8Wen Y.D. Perissi V.

These data suggest that multiple N-CoR-containing histone deacetylase complexes may exist to mediate transcriptional repression. We have previously demonstrated that the frog oocyte is capable of mediating both transcriptional activation by liganded TR and transcriptional repression by unliganded TR, indicating that the oocyte contains the necessary coactivator and corepressor complexes for TR (13Wong J.

To characterize the corepressor complexes present in eggs and oocytes, we biochemically fractionated Xenopus egg extract and purified three distinct complexes. Our data also suggest that one or more of the N-CoR complexes participate in the repression by unliganded TR. Eggs were collected from mature femaleXenopus laevis, and the high-speed egg extract was prepared exactly as described (16Wade, P. A., Jones, P. L., Vermaak, D., and Wolffe, A. P. (1998) Methods Enzymol.Google Scholar). All chromatography was carried out at 4 °C in Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Egg extract was initially fractionated using BioRex70 resin (Bio-Rad) in Buffer A. The flow-through fraction was fractionated over DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a step elution in Buffer A (to 350 mm NaCl). The DEAE (in 350 mmNaCl) step was further fractionated by linear salt gradient elution from Mono Q HR10/10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The peak N-CoR fractions were pooled and loaded directly onto a 110-ml Superose 6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column in Buffer A (in 150 mm NaCl) with 0.04% Triton X-100. The peak N-CoR fractions were fractionated by linear salt gradient elution from Mono S HR5/5. The DEAE flow-through pool was fractionated on SP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a step elution in Buffer A (to 350 mm NaCl). The SP (350 mm) pool was fractionated using a linear salt gradient elution from a Mono Q HR5/5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column followed by gel filtration through Superose 6 as above. The SP-Sepharose flow-through fraction was fractionated over Mono Q 10/10 followed by gel filtration as above. The peak N-CoR fractions were further fractionated over Mono Q 5/5 as above. Either fractionated egg extract (100 μl fraction) or injected oocytes (40 oocytes/sample) were used as the protein sources. Antisera were conjugated to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with dimethyl pimelimidate (DMP) exactly as described (17Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y1999: 321-325Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitations were carried out in Buffer A (100 mm NaCl + 0.05% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 60 min followed by a series of five washes in Buffer A (150 mm NaCl + 0.05% Nonidet P-40). Proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.3, or used in the histone deacetylase assay described below. All coimmunoprecipitations were repeated at least three times. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for Xenopus N-CoR were raised against a bacterially expressed N-terminal polypeptide (amino acids 34–272) derived fromXenopus N-CoR cDNA. 2L. M. Sachs, P. L.

HDAC5 antibody was a generous gift from S. Khochbin (19Lemercier C. Verdel A. Galloo B. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Khochbin S. J. Biol.

Histone deacetylase assays were performed as described (16Wade, P. A., Jones, P. L., Vermaak, D., and Wolffe, A. P. (1998) Methods Enzymol.Google Scholar). Chicken erythrocyte core histones enzymatically acetylated ([3H]acetyl-CoA) with recombinant yeast Hat1p were used as the substrate (20Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried using 25 μl of each fraction in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2 μg of acetylated histones (400-μl final volume). The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and terminated with 100 μl of stop solution (0.1 N HCl and 0.16 N acetic acid). Released acetate was extracted with ethyl acetate (800 μl), and 75% of the organic phase was counted by liquid scintillation. Experiments were repeated at least three times. Oocyte preparation and microinjections were carried out as described (18Fischle W. Emiliani S. Hendzel M.J. Nagase T. Nomura N. Voelter W. Verdin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11713-11720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 3 ng in vitro transcribed capped RNA (Ambion Inc.) encoding Xenopus TRβ and or RXRα. Injected oocytes were incubated for 16 h at 18 °C with or without thyroid hormone (50 nm T3) prior to homogenization in Buffer A (100 mm NaCl). We used X. laevis high speed egg extracts as the source for soluble endogenous proteins to biochemically purify endogenous complexes containing the N-CoR transcriptional corepressor. The extract was initially fractionated over BioRex70 resin, which bound over 90% of the Sin3 corepressor protein present in eggs (data not shown). Surprisingly, all of the detectable N-CoR was contained in the flow-through fraction (data not shown). Size fractionation (Sephacryl S-300) of the BioRex70 flow-through pool demonstrated that all of the N-CoR existed in large complexes (>669 kDa) with no detectable free N-CoR (270 kDa, Fig. 1 A). Further fractionation of the BioRex70 flow-through protein pool over DEAE-Sepharose separated the N-CoR into two distinct pools. Roughly 50% of the N-CoR bound to the DEAE (complex 1) and 50% remained in the flow-through fraction (Fig. 1 B). Fractionation of the DEAE flow-through pool over SP-Sepharose again separated the N-CoR into a bound pool (complex 2) and a flow-through pool (complex 3, Fig.1 B). Extensive purification of all three of the N-CoR protein pools was achieved through a series of ion exchange and gel filtration chromatographic steps as outlined in Fig. 1 D. Size fractionation of the purified complexes through Superose 6 showed that all three N-CoR complexes continued to migrate in the MDa range (data not shown), supporting the observation that the three N-CoR protein pools are in fact distinct macromolecular complexes and not dissociation products. A summary of a typical purification is presented in Table I.Table IProtein recovery data for the purification of N-CoR complexesComplex 1Complex 2Complex 3FractionTotal Protein 1-aProtein concentrations for the fractions were determined using the BioRad protein assay and bovine serum albumin as a standard.FractionTotal Protein 1-aProtein concentrations for the fractions were determined using the BioRad protein assay and bovine serum albumin as a standard.FractionTotal Protein 1-aProtein concentrations for the fractions were determined using the BioRad protein assay and bovine serum albumin as a standard.Egg Extract690 mgEgg Extract690 mgEgg Extract690 mgBioRex70408 mgBioRex70408 mgBioRex70408 mgDEAE82.6 mgDEAE95.7 mgDEAE95.7 mgMono Q5.38 mgSP12.75 mgSP62.4 mgSuperose 60.79 mgMono Q0.55 mgMono Q0.73 mgMono S∼25 μg 1-bProtein concentrations estimated from silver-stained gels compared to standards.Superose 6∼25 μg 1-bProtein concentrations estimated from silver-stained gels compared to standards.Superose 6∼20 μg 1-bProtein concentrations estimated from silver-stained gels compared to standards.Mono Q∼10 μg 1-bProtein concentrations estimated from silver-stained gels compared to standards.1-a Protein concentrations for the fractions were determined using the BioRad protein assay and bovine serum albumin as a standard.1-b Protein concentrations estimated from silver-stained gels compared to standards. Open table in a new tab The polypeptide profiles of the three N-CoR complexes were determined by silver-staining SDS-PAGE separations of the final step of fractionation. These results showed that each complex was largely pure and consisted of multiple distinct polypeptides (Fig.2). Complex 1 contains eight polypeptides, whereas complex 2 and complex 3 each contain four polypeptides. Because N-CoR can interact with Sin3, and Sin3 can interact with Rpd3, we assayed the presence of the Sin3 and Rpd3 proteins as well as histone deacetylase activity in the three N-CoR complexes. Western blot analyses of the final steps of the purifications identified complex 1 as containing Sin3 (p150) and Rpd3 (p58) whereas neither complex 2 nor complex 3 contained either Sin3 or Rpd3 (Fig. 2, B and C). Interestingly, histone deacetylase activity was found to precisely cofractionate with the N-CoR protein for both complexes 1 and 2 (Fig.3, A and B). These data indicate that complex 2 possesses a Sin3-independent histone deacetylase. Complex 3 contained no detectable histone deacetylase activity (Fig. 3 C). Because N-CoR complexes 1 and 2 each contained histone deacetylase activity, we tested for the presence of RbAp48, a protein that binds to the retinoblastoma A tumor suppressor and has been found in several histone deacetylase complexes (Refs.21Qian Y.W.

Thus, complex 1 contains the predicted N-CoR complex components, mainly N-CoR, Rpd3, Sin3, and RbAp48, whereas complexes 2 and 3 are novel and do not appear to share any subunits with complex 1.Figure 3N-CoR complex 1 and complex 2 contain histone deacetylase activity. Fractions, as shown in Fig. 2, were assayed for histone deacetylase activity. Activity precisely copurified with N-CoR protein for complex 1 (A), and complex 2 (B). Complex 3 (C) lacked any detectable HDAC activity. Fraction numbers correspond to those shown in Fig.2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the physical associations between N-CoR and the known components of the complexes, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 4). Immunoprecipitation reactions were carried out using antiserum against N-CoR, Sin3, or Rpd3 as the precipitating antibodies. Xenopus egg extract fractionated through the DEAE step, which separates complex 1 from complexes 2 and 3 (Fig. 1 B), was used as the protein source. The precipitation products were assayed by either Western blot analysis using the N-CoR antibody (Fig. 4 A) or by histone deacetylase assay (Fig. 4 B). Reactions using either the Sin3, N-CoR, or Rpd3 antibodies as the precipitating antibody all immunoprecipitated N-CoR protein when the DEAE-0.35 m step elution (containing complex 1; Fig. 4 A, top panel) was used as the protein source (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2–4). However, when the DEAE flow-through fraction (containing complexes 2 and 3; Fig. 4 A, lower panel) was used as the protein source, only the N-CoR antibody immunoprecipitated N-CoR protein, whereas the Sin3 and Rpd3 antibodies failed to immunoprecipitate any detectable N-CoR protein (Fig. 4 A, lanes 7–8). These data confirm the association of N-CoR with Sin3 and Rpd3 in complex 1 as well as the lack of association between N-CoR and Sin3 or Rpd3 in complexes 2 and 3. For both the DEAE elution and flow-through fractions, an irrelevant antibody (Irr) failed to immunoprecipitate N-CoR protein (Fig.4 A, lanes 5 and 10). In addition, antibodies against N-CoR specifically immunoprecipitated histone deacetylase activity from both protein pools (Fig. 4 B). These data support the existence of at least two independent multisubunit N-CoR/histone deacetylase complexes. In addition, these results show a physical association of N-CoR with Sin3, Rpd3, and HDAC activity in complex 1 (but not in complexes 2 or 3) and N-CoR with HDAC activity in complex 2. We have shown previously that unliganded TRβ represses target promoters in frog oocytes and that this repression can be reversed by blocking HDAC activity (15Wong J. Patterton D. Imhof A. Guschin D. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 520-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To investigate if any of the N-CoR complexes participate in this repression, we overexpressed TRβ and its heterodimer partner RXRα (9-cis retinoic acid receptor) by microinjecting in vitro transcribed mRNA into frog oocytes and analyzing associations with N-CoR. Immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies against TRβ (Fig.5 A) indicate that TRβ/RXRα heterodimers (lanes 2 and 3), as well as TRβ homodimers (lanes 4 and 5) interact with endogenous N-CoR in a thyroid hormone (T3)-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation experiments using precipitating antibodies against N-CoR (Fig.5 B) confirm a ligand-dependent interaction between N-CoR and TRβ (lanes 2–5). N-CoR was initially characterized as a corepressor for unliganded TRs; however, it has been shown to participate in transcriptional repression through other transcription factors (reviewed in Refs. 2Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 255-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar and26Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice lacking N-CoR have multiple developmental defects and show that N-CoR is required for the repressive effects of several classes of DNA-binding transcriptional repressors (27Jepsen K.

We have purified two N-CoR/histone deacetylase complexes from Xenopus eggs and one N-CoR complex of unknown biological activity. All three N-CoR complexes are very large in size (>MDa) and consist of multiple polypeptides. Two of the N-CoR complexes clearly have histone deacetylase activity (Fig. 3, A and B); however, the absence of Rpd3 (HDAC1) in N-CoR complex 2 suggested the presence of alternative histone deacetylases. Currently, seven histone deacetylases have been found in mammals that are separated into two different classes based on amino acid homology; class I contains Rpd3 (HDAC1), HDAC2, and HDAC3 whereas class II contains HDAC4–7 (9Kao H.Y.

Staszewski L.M. Yang W.M. Krones A. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7202-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 11Huang E.Y. Zhang J. Miska E.A.

These HDAC proteins are generally well conserved during evolution, making it feasible to use heterologous antibodies to check for the presence of various HDACs in the frog complexes despite the lack of sequence information on frog HDAC2–7. We obtained antibodies raised against mammalian HDAC3, 4, and 5 for Western blot analysis of the purified complexes. Only antibodies against HDAC3 and HDAC5 detected polypeptides of similar size as their mammalian homologs (Fig. 1 C). However, Western blot analysis of the purified complexes with the HDAC3 and HDAC5 antibodies indicated that neither HDAC3 nor HDAC5 was present in any of the complexes (data not shown). Thus, whereas complex 1 contains Rpd3 (HDAC1), complex 2 clearly does not contain Rpd3 (HDAC1, Fig. 2 B). However, we cannot rule out or identify any of the other HDACs with the available reagents. In addition to having distinct polypeptide compositions, visualization by silver staining (assuming equivalent staining sensitivities among all of the various polypeptides) revealed that the three N-CoR complexes do not appear to have a 1:1 stoichiometry among all of the associated polypeptides in relation to N-CoR (Fig. 2). In complex 1, six of the eight polypeptides appear to be in a 1:1 ratio with N-CoR, whereas Rpd3 (2:1) and RbAp48 (4:1) are clearly more abundant. The resulting mass of complex 1 is predicted to be slightly more than 1 MDa. The multiple copies of Rpd3 and RbAp48 in the complex may suggest their functions as the catalytic subunit and a histone-interacting subunit, respectively. The four subunits of complex 2 (N-CoR, p115, p60, and p52), appear to have a stoichiometry of 1:1:2:4 respectively. It is possible that the complex exists as a multimer in vivoas the mass of the complex is greater than 1 MDa when assayed by gel filtration chromatography even though the sum of the polypeptides is only 700 kDa. Complex 3 also consists of four polypeptides (N-CoR, p120, p65, and p29), with a stoichiometry of 2:3:1:1, respectively, predicting a mass of 1 MDa. The role of the multiple subunits may indicate that the complexes must interact with multiple targeting proteins or additional corepressor complexes in vivo. Clearly, further studies on the exact stoichiometry of these complexes and their biochemical and molecular properties are required to determine their biological functions and mechanisms. The ability of unliganded TRs to repress gene transcription in the frog oocyte in a histone deacetylase-dependent manner together with our isolation of two N-CoR-containing histone deacetylase complexes argues that one or more of these complexes participates in the repression process. This conclusion is supported by the interaction of overexpressed TRβ with N-CoR in the frog oocytes, where all of the N-CoR is present in large complexes. Whereas the functional differences among these complexes remain to be investigated, our findings provide an explanation for some inconsistent earlier observations. First, N-CoR was initially shown to interact with Rpd3 (HDAC1) through mSin3, but N-CoR/mSin3/Rpd3 complexes have eluded biochemical purificationin vivo. Second, N-CoR has been shown to be able to interact with both class I and class II histone deacetylases in vitroand form complexes with them in vivo (8Wen Y.D. Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. Yang W.M.

Our results here demonstrate that these possibilities coexist in vivo. The failure of other studies to detect the multiple complexes is likely because of the choice of the systems and the purification procedures, which we found to be crucial for the separation and isolation of the three complexes. It is also worth noting that our procedure allowed us to successfully purify the first complex that contains Sin3, Rpd3 (HDAC1), and RbAp48 together. Extensive studies including coimmunoprecipitations have demonstrated pairwise associations between mSin3A, Rpd3 (HDAC1), and RbAp48, suggesting that the three proteins may exist together in a complex. However, until our study here, such a complex had eluded purification. Our data here provide a potential mechanism whereby N-CoR complexes are differentially recruited by specific transcriptional regulators to repress target genes. An additional level of regulation may come from changes in the ratio among the various N-CoR complexes or from alterations in subunit concentrations. These findings provide an opportunity to investigate these possible mechanisms in the near future."

Ligand binding to nuclear receptors leads to dramatic structural transitions of the polypeptidic chain that alter several functions of the ligand-bound receptor. These functions are specified by structural domains, the organization of which is shared in this gene superfamily. Another general property of nuclear receptors is their capacity to engage protein/protein interactions, which serves essentially two purposes: (i) increasing the specificity and affinity for hormone response elements through homodimerization or heterodimerization with other nuclear receptors and (ii) modulating nuclear receptor transcriptional activity through ligand-modulated recruitment of nuclear coactivators and corepressors. Although the role of ligand in inducing conformational alterations of the receptor that either disrupt (nuclear corepressor) or stabilize (nuclear coactivator) protein/protein binding interfaces is abundantly documented (reviewed in Refs. 1Rachez C. Freedman L.P. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 246: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar and 2Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the biological relevance of ligand-induced nuclear receptor homodimerization and heterodimerization in the absence of DNA is more controversial. Retinoic acid receptors (RARs)1 and 9-cis-retinoic acid receptors (RXRs) have two dimerization interfaces, which are located in the DNA-binding domain and the ligand-binding domain (LBD) (3Rachez C. Sautiere P. Formstecher P. Lefebvre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17996-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These two domains are functionally autonomous, and isolated RAR and RXR DNA-binding domains bind as dimers specifically and cooperatively to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) similarly to wild-type (WT) receptors (4Zechel C. Shen X.Q. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1414-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We have shown that the RAR LBD contains a strong dimerization interface in helix 9 enabling RXR/RAR interaction in the absence of DNA (3Rachez C. Sautiere P. Formstecher P. Lefebvre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17996-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These observations and others also demonstrate that receptor dimerization and DNA binding are, at least in vitro, ligand-independent events. This consequently questions the role of ligand as a regulator of receptor dimerization, despite the presence of a strong dimerization interface in the LBD, which is likely to be altered, directly or indirectly, upon ligand binding. Ligand-dependent dimerization of some nuclear receptors has, however, been reported for various systems. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 favors the dissociation of vitamin D3receptor homodimers into monomers, rendering vitamin D3receptor molecules available for dimerization with RXR (5Cheskis B. Freedman L.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3309-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thyroid hormone has been shown to promote thyroid hormone receptor dimerization with RXR prior to DNA binding both in vivo and in vitro (6Collingwood T.N. Butler A. Tone Y. CliftonBligh R.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13060-13065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and 9-cis-retinoic acid was shown to induce RXR homodimerization, providing a molecular basis for the observed inhibition of vitamin D3 receptor- and thyroid hormone receptor-enhanced transcription by 9-cis-retinoic acid (5Cheskis B. Freedman L.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3309-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Collingwood T.N. Butler A. Tone Y. CliftonBligh R.J. Parker M.G. Chatterjee V.K.K. J. Biol.

Lefebvre P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5477-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, the importance of ligand structure in regulating receptor dimerization is poorly understood, and conclusions drawn from the study of synthetic ligands for sex steroid receptors such as antiestrogens (9Wang H.

Altmann M. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1914-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which are clinically important molecules, suggested that transcriptional inhibition stems either from a repressing activity of antagonist-bound monomer or from impaired dimerization (11Fawell S.E.

Since the role of ligand in receptor dimerization has not yet been studied for the RXR/RAR system, we decided to investigate the role of retinoids in the regulation of RXR·RAR dimerization in vivo and in vitro using a panel of natural and synthetic retinoids with distinct biological properties. Results obtained using quantitative GST pull-down experiments and a mammalian two-hybrid system demonstrated that RAR agonists stabilized hRXRα·hRARα heterodimers as a function of their affinity for monomeric hRARα, whereas antagonists were unable to promote heterodimer formation. This lack of activity may result, at least in part, from an impaired AF-2 (activationfunction-2) folding since a mutation designed to prevent the stabilization of the holo-hRARα structure similarly decreased the affinity of hRARα for hRXRα. hRXRα AF-2 did not display any significant contribution to dimerization, suggesting that the hRARα monomer has a predominant role in regulating the dimerization rate with RXR. atRA was obtained from Sigma (Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France).

The (GRARE)3-tk-Luc reporter gene is a pGL3-based vector (Promega) containing three repeats of a composite response element made up of a glucocorticoid response element half-site separated from a RARE half-site by a 5-bp spacer (AGAACAccgaaAGGTCA). This response element was cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter (−105 to +50). This reporter gene was activable only in the presence of overexpressed RARs and of a mutant hRXRα, RXGR: mutations introduced into hRXRα converted the P box sequence scEGckGff to ccGSckVff, hence conferring to hRXRα the ability to bind specifically glucocorticoid response elements. 2C.

The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmEDTA, 50 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.15 mmspermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 5 mm sodium butyrate, and protease mixture inhibitor (1:100 dilution; Sigma)). Cells were lysed by several strokes in a Dounce with an A-type pestle, and the homogenate was layered onto a 0.8 m sucrose cushion in buffer A. Nuclei (∼3–5 A260) were digested with 80–100 units of SmaI (Promega) in a final volume of 200 μl in SmaI digestion buffer. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of stop buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% SDS, 25 mm EDTA, and 5 mg/ml proteinase K (Promega)) and incubated for 8 h at 37 °C. DNA was purified, and 50–80 μg was digested with 25 units of PstI. Cleaved DNAs were analyzed on native 1% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Gels were transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and DNA was UV-cross-linked to the membrane. Hybridization was carried out with a 600-bp RARβ2 32P-labeled probe (Rediprime II, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was amplified from mouse genomic DNA using the following set of primers: 5′-ttggccaggaacaggagagc-3′ and 5′-tttaccattttccaggctcg-3′ (nucleotides 418–437 and 1031 to 1012, respectively, in the mouse retinoic acid receptor-β gene promoter region; GenBankTM/EBI accession number X56850.1). After hybridization, blots were washed, and radioactive material was detected using a Storm 860 Phosphoimager. Total RNA was prepared using RNAble reagent (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (50 μg) was then treated with 10 units of RNase-free DNase I (Genhunter, Nashville, TN) for 1 h at 37 °C to digest genomic DNA. The purified RNA was adjusted to 1 μg/μl and checked for integrity by agarose gel electrophoresis. Reverse transcription was performed using random primers (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. PCR primers were designed as follows: RARβ, 5′-aagtggtaggaagtgagctg-3′ and 5′-ctacattgagcagtatgccg-3; and actin, 5′-atcatgtttgagaccttcaa-3′ and 5′-catctcttgctcgaagtcca-3′. PCR conditions were 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C followed by an elongation step at 72 °C for 7 min (RARβ) and 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C followed by an elongation step at 72 °C for 7 min (actin). All incubations or assays were performed at least in triplicate. Measured values were used to calculate mean ± S.D. Calculations were carried out using Prism software (GraphPAD Inc., San Diego, CA) Interaction of hRARα with hRXRα was first characterized using a mammalian two-hybrid interaction assay. In this system, the acidic VP16 activation domain (AD) is fused to the N terminus of full-length hRARα, whereas the Gal4 DNA-binding domain is linked to the N-terminal end of the hRXRα LBD (Fig. 1 A). The activity of a reporter gene containing two Gal4 consensus DNA-binding sites (UAS-tk-Luc) was the biological readout used to monitor the interaction between these two receptors in HeLa cells. Transfection of VP16-hRARα did not promote a significant increase in reporter gene activity,2 but Gal4-hRXRα LBD alone turned out to be responsive to the RXR-specific ligand CD2425, which induced a 4–5-fold increased activity (Fig. 1 B). When WT hRARα was overexpressed together with Gal4-hRXRα LBD, a very modest increase (1.5-fold) in the level of luciferase activity was detected in cell extracts in response to retinoid treatment, suggesting that the hRARα AF-2 region is unable to activate this system. Since Gal4-hRXRα LBD, WT hRARα, and VP16-hRARα were expressed at similar levels in HeLa cells as judged by whole cell ligand binding assays (from 30,000 to 100,000 sites/cell),2 this clearly suggests that WT hRARα is unable per se to mediate a significant ligand-dependent activation of the system. Coexpression of Gal4-hRXRα LBD and VP16-hRARα led to a detectable ligand-independent activation of the reporter gene (3–5-fold), and addition of RAR-specific ligands strongly increased reporter gene activity (10–15-fold). However, the ligand-mediated activation of the two-hybrid system appeared to be restricted to RARα-binding agonists such as atRA and Am580. As expected, RARβ-selective (CD417) and RARγ-selective ligands (Fig.2)2 had no effect in our system, in agreement with their very poor affinity for hRARα. The RAR antagonist Ro 41-5253 did not activate this system, and Ro 41-5253 competitively inhibited atRA-induced activity.2 More surprisingly, the RXR-specific ligand, which was able to induce a 4–5-fold increase in reporter gene activity when RXR was expressed alone, was inactive when WT hRARα or VP16-hRARα was coexpressed with Gal4-hRXRα. The ligand-dependent activation paralleled the pattern of induction observed when using full-length hRARα, hRXRα, and a DR5 RARE-driven reporter gene ((GRARE)3-tk-Luc) (Fig.1 B). In the same assay, VP16-hRARα responded to ligands its wild-type counterpart, but promoted a much higher transcriptional activity of the (GRARE)3-tk-Luc reporter, as expected from the presence of the strong VP16 AD acidic activator. These observations thus revealed several features of the two-hybrid system. First, they suggest that RXR/RAR interaction occurs in the absence of ligand. In line with this observation, coexpression of RAR and RXR inactivated RXR responsiveness to ligand, suggesting that RAR interaction inhibits RXR function. Second, only RARα-specific agonists are able to increase significantly the activity of this system. Third, RAR-dependent activation is enhanced by the VP16 AD, consistent with the hypothesis of ligand-dependent dimerization. However, our data do not rule out at this stage that RAR agonist requirement merely reflects a synergism of RAR AF-2 with the VP16 AD and/or a repression exerted by unliganded hRARα on VP16 activation function. Unliganded, heterodimeric hRARα interacts with the corepressor SMRT, which dissociates upon agonist binding, and this interaction is stabilized in the presence of antagonists (19Apfel C. Bauer F. Crettaz M. Forni L. Kamber M. Kaufmann F. LeMotte P. Pirson W. Klaus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7129-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To test whether the agonist-induced activity of the two-hybrid system is due to corepressor release, we assayed the activity of a hRARα mutant containing a double mutation (A194G/H195G, hRARα AHT) in the nuclear corepressor box (20Horlein A.M. Naar A. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamel Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar), which considerably lessened hRARα interaction with SMRT (10–12-fold) (Fig. 2 A) without altering the ligand binding activity of the receptor. 3A. Mouchon and P. Lefebvre, unpublished observations. Interaction with SRC-1 was also diminished, yet clearly detectable. Such a mutation would thus predictably lead to an enhanced basal level of reporter gene activity and/or to a decreased ligand-induced activity. While showing a low constitutive activity, as already reported for an analogous mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor (6Collingwood T.N. Butler A. Tone Y. CliftonBligh R.J. Parker M.G. Chatterjee V.K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13060-13065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), hRARα AHT displayed a ligand-induced activity similar to that of WT hRARα, arguing against a possible role for corepressors and coactivators in VP16 activity control. In keeping with this, we observed that truncation of the RXR AF-2 AD region dominant negative (RXR), which strongly increases corepressor binding to RXR (21Schulman I.G. Juguilon H. Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3807-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar),2 did not affect the response of the system to atRA treatment (see Fig. 4). Another possibility is that the observed luciferase activity results from the synergistic contribution of the hRARα AF-2 AD and VP16 AD to the transcriptional activation of the reporter gene. Leucine 409 of hRARα is located in helix 12, and its mutation leads to transcriptional inactivation of hRARα while maintaining WT ligand binding activity (Fig. 3 C) (22Tate B.F. Allenby G. Perez J.R. Levin A.A. Grippo J.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1524-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).2 This amino acid becomes part of the hydrophobic groove formed upon agonist-induced AF-2 AD folding to which coactivators bind through their LXXLL motif. The L409A substitution abolished ligand-induced SRC-1 recruitment to hRARα, whereas receptor binding to SMRT was left unchanged (Fig.2 A). RARα L409A induced both basal and ligand-induced activities comparable to WT hRARα in the two-hybrid system (Fig.2 A), suggesting again that atRA-induced activity is indeed due to receptor heterodimerization and not to the concerted activation of the hRARα AF-2 AD and VP16 AD. The observed inactivity of the two-hybrid system in the presence of antagonists may stem from the inhibition of the VP16 moiety, as suggested for progesterone antagonists (10Leonhardt S.A. Altmann M. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1914-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we monitored the activity of WT hRARα and VP16-hRARα in a standard transactivation assay using a DR5-driven reporter gene (Fig.2 B). As expected, atRA promoted a very strong increase (8–15-fold induction) in reporter gene activity in the presence of overexpressed hRARα or VP16-hRARα, whereas a very modest increase (2-fold) was observed when cells were challenged by two antagonists, CD3105 and CD3106 (23Klein E.S. Pino M.E. Johnson A.T. Davies P.J. Nagpal S. Thacher S.M. Krasinski G. Chandraratna R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22692-22696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Competitive inhibition of atRA-induced transcription was observed when each antagonist was used together with atRA. The basal level of transcription was higher (8–10-fold increase) when VP16-hRARα was expressed in HeLa cells together with hRXRα, as expected from the strong transactivating potential of the VP16 AD. The basal level of transcription was again slightly increased (2-fold) in the presence of both antagonists and was not decreased, as it could be predicted if VP16 function was conditioned by RAR activity, demonstrating that VP16 AD transactivating potential is not altered upon antagonist binding to hRARα. The inhibition of RXR activity upon expression of WT hRARα or VP16-hRARα suggested an allosteric control of RXR function by RAR and implied that a fraction of RAR and RXR populations is involved in ligand-independent dimerization. We thus tested whether antagonist binding to hRARα affected RXR response to a specific ligand (Fig. 2 C). When Gal4-hRXRα was expressed alone, the system was responsive to RXR ligand, and this responsiveness was not affected by RAR ligands. Overexpression of hRARα conferred responsiveness to a RAR agonist (Am580), and the RXR-induced activity was repressed, as shown above. Cotreatment of cells with the RAR-specific agonist Am580 and the RXR-specific agonist CD2425 did not reveal any synergy between both receptors. Very interestingly, addition of the RAR antagonist CD3106 together with the RXR-specific agonist restored a RXR-induced response, similar to that observed in the presence of Gal4-hRXRα alone, suggesting that RXR is able, under these conditions, to function autonomously. These results thus support our view that RAR antagonists prevent RAR interaction with RXR in vivo. The results shown in Fig. 1 suggested several important conclusions. (i) Ligand binding is required to stabilize RXR·RAR dimers in vivo; (ii) antagonists, despite having a high affinity for RAR, do not induce detectable interactions between these two receptors; and (iii) dimerization is dependent solely on ligand occupancy of the hRARα ligand-binding pocket. We extended our observation to a panel of synthetic retinoids with distinct biological properties: isotype-selective RAR agonists, a partial agonist, antagonists, and dissociated (anti-AP-1) retinoids (Fig.3 A). Comparing the maximal induction of the GAL4reporter gene in the presence of these retinoids allowed us to distinguish two classes of molecules: active and inactive compounds. A closer examination showed that active compounds were referenced, based on transactivation assays, as RARα agonists (atRA, CD367, Am580, and Am80). Inactive compounds were either RARβ-selective (CD417) or RARγ-selective (CD666) retinoids or RAR antagonists (CD3106, CD2331, CD2905, and CD2856). The recently described anti-AP-1 retinoid CD2409 (24Vega-Diaz B. Lenoir M.C. Ladoux A. Frelin C. Démarchez M. Michel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 642-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was unable to promote RXR·RAR dimerization, and the partial agonist CD2665 had an intermediate ability to induce RXR·RAR heterodimerization in vivo. We then monitored the activity of the VP16-RARα L409A mutant in response to several retinoids in the same system (Fig. 3 B). This transcriptionally defective RARα mutant displayed a similar response profile to agonists and antagonists compared with WT RARα, establishing that RARα AF-2 does not contribute to the activity of the system. Agonist-induced luciferase activity was fully inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, by CD3106, suggesting that the observed inhibition results from direct competition for the ligand-binding pocket of RARα. Moreover, limited proteolytic assays carried out in parallel using WT RARα and RARα L409A (Fig.3 C) showed that both receptors underwent similar structural transitions upon ligand binding, establishing that the L409A mutation did not significantly alter RARα three-dimensional structure. Thus, our data and others show that the L409A mutation is compatible with antagonist binding and ligand-induced dimerization. Retinoids able to bind hRARα with high affinity can be classified according to their ability to induce hRXRα·hRARα dimerization: agonists and others, this latter category including, most notably, anti-retinoids. The two-hybrid system thus discriminates between agonists and potential antagonists on the basis of ligand ability to induce dimerization in vivo. Major structural transitions occur in the LBD of nuclear receptors upon ligand binding and lead to the repositioning of several α-helices. The AF-2 AD region (helix 12), which is fully exposed to solvent in the unliganded state (aporeceptor), establishes salt bridges with basic amino acids located in helices 3 and 4. This repositioning along the LBD creates a hydrophobic groove to which nuclear coactivators bind via LXXLL motifs (holoreceptor). RAR AF-2 AD repositioning may thus have a role in remodeling dimerization interfaces of RAR, and we tested this hypothesis using both in vitro and in vivo protein/protein interaction assays (Fig.4). The RARα holo-LBD three-dimensional structure designates Lys244 and Lys262 as establishing salt bridges with acidic residues located in the AF-2 AD region (Glu412and Glu415), and mutation of each lysine yields receptor mutants with impaired transactivating properties (17Mouchon A. Delmotte M.-H. Formstecher P. Lefebvre P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3073-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mutating both of these lysines yielded an inactive receptor (hRARα K244A/K262A) in the transactivation assay (Fig. 4 A). This RAR mutant was unable to interact with nuclear coactivators and corepressors in vitro.2 GST pull-down assays revealed that hRARα K244A/K262A was still able to interact with hRXRα in a ligand-dependent manner, with an estimatedKd of 40–60 nm when complexed to atRA. This double mutation induced a 4–5-fold decrease in the affinity of hRARα for RXR, which was also reflected in the mammalian two-hybrid system by only a 2-fold increase in the activity of the Gal4/VP16 system, in sharp contrast to WT hRARα, which promoted a 5–7-fold increase (Fig. 4 A). Thus, a 4-fold decreased activity in the two-hybrid system is correlated with a 4-fold decrease in the hRARα affinity for hRXRα in vitro. The RXR AF-2 AD motif has been proposed to regulate negatively nuclear coactivator access to RAR by direct interaction with the LBD hydrophobic groove (25Westin S. Kurokawa R."

Plcg1-null embryos were used to produce immortalized fibroblasts genetically deficient in PLC-γ1 (Null cells), and retroviral infection of those cells was used to derive PLC-γ1 re-expressing cells (Null+ cells). In terms of PDGF activation of PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1 and Erk2, Null and Null+ cells responded equivalently. However, the PDGF-dependent expression of all IEG mRNAs was diminished in cells lacking PLC-γ1. The expression of FIC, COX-2, KC,JE, and c-fos mRNAs were most strongly compromised, as the stimulation of these genes was reduced by more than 90% in cells lacking PLC-γ1. The combination of PMA and ionomycin, downstream analogs of PLC activation, did provoke expression of mRNAs for these IEGs in the Null cells.

https://openalex.org/W2015469420,"O ne of the strangest partnerships in nature is the pairing of the symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia with a remarkable range of insect hosts. Wolbachia live in the cytoplasm of insect cells and apparently do no harm. These endosymbionts do, however, have a startling effect on the reproduction of their insect hosts, which has led biologists to speculate that Wolbachia may contribute to reproductive isolation and the creation of new insect species (speciation). Bordenstein et al. ([1][1]) now provide evidence that this indeed may be the case.

When male insects infected with Wolbachia mate with uninfected females, no offspring are produced (because the cytoplasm of infected sperm is incompatible with the cytoplasm of uninfected eggs). Yet viable offspring result from all other mating combinations (uninfected males and infected females, infected males and infected females, and uninfected males and uninfected females). This arrangement ensures that Wolbachia (which are passed to offspring only through females) spread rapidly through the host species because uninfected females that mate with infected males cannot produce offspring. But is this partial reproductive isolation sufficient to drive the emergence of new insect species· Bordenstein and colleagues speculated that if a host insect population was infected with different Wolbachia strains that were incompatible (so that individuals infected with one strain could not produce offspring with individuals infected with the other), then this double reproductive barrier might be sufficient to drive speciation.

They set out to test their hypothesis in two closely related species of parasitic wasp, Nasonia giraulti (which inhabits eastern North America) and Nasonia longicornis (which inhabits western North America). In both species, individuals were infected with different Wolbachia strains and reproductive incompatibility was bidirectional: Matings between N. longicornis males and N. giraulti females, and between N. giraulti males and N. longicornis females produced few or no hybrid offspring. But when both species were treated with antibiotics to cure their Wolbachia infection, interspecies matings produced normal numbers of hybrid offspring. Working with uninfected wasps, the authors then tested several other reproductive barriers (unrelated to Wolbachia infection), such as reduced fertility and hybrid breakdown, that are known to precede the formation of two separate species. Interspecies matings did not reduce the number of eggs laid or the number of viable hybrid offspring produced, and sperm of one species was capable of fertilizing eggs of the other. There was also no evidence of hybrid breakdown because hybrid male offspring mating with female offspring of either species did not show abnormal courtship behavior or reduced fertility.

The authors conclude that microbial-induced reproductive isolation is already apparent between N. longicornis and N. giraulti , whereas genetically driven reproductive barriers have not yet been formed. Bordenstein et al. are careful not to endorse Wolbachia as the means of Nasonia speciation (geographical isolation is arguably a far more important factor in this case), but their work offers a tantalizing glimpse into how an apparently harmless endosymbiont could alter the course of evolution.
