https://openalex.org/W2003173546,"If the atmosphere is uniformly mixed, a mixing ratio of nitrogen to carbon dioxide of 5 percent is consistent with the observational data on the ultraviolet dayglow of Mars. If the magnitude of the eddy coefficient in the atmosphere is similar to that for the earth, this limit is reduced to less than 0.5 percent."

https://openalex.org/W2083725861,"From the Flory-Stockmayer theory and molecular weights of successive fractions of lignin obtained by extraction of spruce wood with a mixture of water, dioxane, and hydrochloric acid and by sulfonation, the average length of the primary chains was estimated to be 18 phenylpropane units. From data on the acid-catalyzed cleavage of model compounds in various solvents the degrees of cross-linking in four extraction processes were calculated. The average degree of cross-linking of intact lignin was found to be 0.277; that is, 5 out of every 18 phenylpropane units bear cross-linking benzyl ether groups. Of the five, three are also etherified at their phenolic ends (B groups), and two are not (X groups)."
https://openalex.org/W1976721687,"Sensitized ultraviolet irradiation of cyclohexenes and cycloheptenes in protic solvents causes reactions which seemingly proceed by way of carbocation intermediates. These intermediates, in turn, may arise from a photochemically produced trans cycloalkene which is so highly strained that protonation by even weak acids such as methanol may proceed readily. This picture is supported by product analysis, deuterium labeling experiments, and stereochemical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2042159662,"The thermal conductivity of a synthetic lunar rock in its melting range is about half that of a terrestrial basalt. The low conductivity and increased efficiency of insulating crusts on lunar lavas will enable flows to cover great distances without being quenched by high radiant heat losses from the surface. For a given rate of heat production, the thermal gradient of the moon would be significantly steeper than that of the earth."

https://openalex.org/W1970887647,"Bistatic-radar scattering from medium- to long-wavelength (80 to 200 meters) ocean waves has been observed with the use of loran A (1.85 megahertz) transmissions and a receiver located 280 kilometers away. The received echoes have been converted into a time-delay, Doppler-frequency map in which the effects of anisotropies in the ocean-wave spectra are clearly shown. The distribution of the echoes in delay-Doppler space is consistent with Bragg scattering from trains of dispersed ocean waves."
https://openalex.org/W1990451080,"Policies and pressures emanating from the 1972 Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act favor the installation of cooling towers, or closedcycle cooling systems, in power plants. An assessment of the relative risks of alternative cooling system designs indicates that, in general, adverse environmental effects associated with cooling towers are more certain, are of larger scale, and are more likely to be irreversible than impacts associated with once-through cooling systems and cooling reservoirs. Adverse environmental effects associated with once-through cooling and cooling reservoirs are largely amenable to mitigation in the context of resource management principles. These factors, together with the greater costs associated with cooling towers, indicate that wherever the feasibility is demonstrated and there is minimal risk to aquatic ecosystems, once-through cooling systems or cooling reservoirs should be preferred."
https://openalex.org/W2090559257,"In summary, the following points are made: 1) There are essentially two approaches to seeding for rain inducement, static and dynamic. 2) The dynamic approach is effective in inducing growth and increasing precipitation from individually seeded convective clouds under specifiable conditions. 3) The static approach to seeding for precipitation increases is apparently not relevant to the summer cumuli of Florida and Missouri. 4) Regional seeding climatologies, including studies of natural freezing processes in convective clouds, should be completed before commencement of a seeding operation. 5) The results of a seeding operation are frequently better understood by stratification of the data, especially with respect to weather conditions. Precipitation increases from seeding are usually found under fair weather regimes with isolated showers, whereas decreases are often noted under naturally rainy conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2005406113,"Growth of tumors induced on primary leaves of bean plants by Agrobacterium tumefaciens was increased by the addition of lysopine and octopine. A detectable response was observed when as little as 1 microgram of these compounds was added per leaf, and the mean volume of the tumors was increased two- to threefold when greater amounts were applied. The specificity of the response and the unique association of these compounds with the tumors suggest that endogenous lysopine and octopine contribute to the growth characteristics of these tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2086933377,"Crystalline rocks from Mare Tranquillitatis have yielded potassium-argon dates as old as 3.8 x 10(9) years. Crystalline rocks from Oceanus Procellarum give potassium-argon ages as old as 2.8 x 10(9) years. Evidently the maria are ancient features of the moon and were not formed contemporaneously, a conclusion that also has been verified by other methods. The potassium-argon ages of rocks from Oceanus Procellarum show much more loss of argon than the rocks from Mare Tranquillitatis, an indication that the rocks at Oceanus Procellarum have experienced more severe shock effects or longer cooling rates."
