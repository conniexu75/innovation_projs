https://openalex.org/W2151592156,"The dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) in bismuth antimony telluride (BiSbTe) bulk alloys has remained around 1 for more than 50 years. We show that a peak ZT of 1.4 at 100 degrees C can be achieved in a p-type nanocrystalline BiSbTe bulk alloy. These nanocrystalline bulk materials were made by hot pressing nanopowders that were ball-milled from crystalline ingots under inert conditions. Electrical transport measurements, coupled with microstructure studies and modeling, show that the ZT improvement is the result of low thermal conductivity caused by the increased phonon scattering by grain boundaries and defects. More importantly, ZT is about 1.2 at room temperature and 0.8 at 250 degrees C, which makes these materials useful for cooling and power generation. Cooling devices that use these materials have produced high-temperature differences of 86 degrees , 106 degrees , and 119 degrees C with hot-side temperatures set at 50 degrees, 100 degrees, and 150 degrees C, respectively. This discovery sets the stage for use of a new nanocomposite approach in developing high-performance low-cost bulk thermoelectric materials."
https://openalex.org/W1987696643,"The design of new enzymes for reactions not catalysed by naturally occurring biocatalysts is a challenge for protein engineering and is a critical test of our understanding of enzyme catalysis. Here we describe the computational design of eight enzymes that use two different catalytic motifs to catalyse the Kemp elimination—a model reaction for proton transfer from carbon—with measured rate enhancements of up to 105 and multiple turnovers. Mutational analysis confirms that catalysis depends on the computationally designed active sites, and a high-resolution crystal structure suggests that the designs have close to atomic accuracy. Application of in vitro evolution to enhance the computational designs produced a >200-fold increase in kcat/Km (kcat/Km of 2,600 M-1s-1 and kcat/kuncat of >106). These results demonstrate the power of combining computational protein design with directed evolution for creating new enzymes, and we anticipate the creation of a wide range of useful new catalysts in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2072230758,"A unique feature of the germ cell lineage is the generation of totipotency. A critical event in this context is DNA demethylation and the erasure of parental imprints in mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs) on embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) after they enter into the developing gonads. Little is yet known about the mechanism involved, except that it is apparently an active process. We have examined the associated changes in the chromatin to gain further insights into this reprogramming event. Here we show that the chromatin changes occur in two steps. The first changes in nascent PGCs at E8.5 establish a distinctive chromatin signature that is reminiscent of pluripotency. Next, when PGCs are residing in the gonads, major changes occur in nuclear architecture accompanied by an extensive erasure of several histone modifications and exchange of histone variants. Furthermore, the histone chaperones HIRA and NAP-1 (NAP111), which are implicated in histone exchange, accumulate in PGC nuclei undergoing reprogramming. We therefore suggest that the mechanism of histone replacement is critical for these chromatin rearrangements to occur. The marked chromatin changes are intimately linked with genome-wide DNA demethylation. On the basis of the timing of the observed events, we propose that if DNA demethylation entails a DNA repair-based mechanism, the evident histone replacement would represent a repair-induced response event rather than being a prerequisite."
https://openalex.org/W2113546393,"Many theories have been offered to explain the evolution of cooperation in humans. One proposal is that costly punishment can promote cooperation. Everyone benefits on average, the theory goes, despite the cost to those doing the punishing. But most of our interactions are repeated, and in such cases punishment can lead to retaliation. Using a variant of the 'Prisoner's Dilemma' game, Dreber et al. find that punishment increases the frequency of cooperation, but not the average payoff. Costly punishments confer no overall advantage to the group. And players who end up with the highest total payoff ('winners') tend not to use punishment, while those with the lowest payoff ('losers') punish most frequently. It seems that costly punishment may not have evolved to promote cooperation, but for some other purpose. An experimental economics approach finds that punishment increases the frequency of cooperation, but not the average payoff. Thus, the option of costly punishment does not confer an advantage to the group. Moreover, players who end up with the highest total payoff ('winners') do not use punishment, whereas players who end up with the lowest payoff ('losers') use punishment most frequently. A key aspect of human behaviour is cooperation1,2,3,4,5,6,7. We tend to help others even if costs are involved. We are more likely to help when the costs are small and the benefits for the other person significant. Cooperation leads to a tension between what is best for the individual and what is best for the group. A group does better if everyone cooperates, but each individual is tempted to defect. Recently there has been much interest in exploring the effect of costly punishment on human cooperation8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23. Costly punishment means paying a cost for another individual to incur a cost. It has been suggested that costly punishment promotes cooperation even in non-repeated games and without any possibility of reputation effects10. But most of our interactions are repeated and reputation is always at stake. Thus, if costly punishment is important in promoting cooperation, it must do so in a repeated setting. We have performed experiments in which, in each round of a repeated game, people choose between cooperation, defection and costly punishment. In control experiments, people could only cooperate or defect. Here we show that the option of costly punishment increases the amount of cooperation but not the average payoff of the group. Furthermore, there is a strong negative correlation between total payoff and use of costly punishment. Those people who gain the highest total payoff tend not to use costly punishment: winners don’t punish. This suggests that costly punishment behaviour is maladaptive in cooperation games and might have evolved for other reasons."

https://openalex.org/W2012598119,"Operons are clusters of unrelated genes with related functions that are a feature of prokaryotic genomes. Here, we report on an operon-like gene cluster in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana that is required for triterpene synthesis (the thalianol pathway). The clustered genes are coexpressed, as in bacterial operons. However, despite the resemblance to a bacterial operon, this gene cluster has been assembled from plant genes by gene duplication, neofunctionalization, and genome reorganization, rather than by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria. Furthermore, recent assembly of operon-like gene clusters for triterpene synthesis has occurred independently in divergent plant lineages ( Arabidopsis and oat). Thus, selection pressure may act during the formation of certain plant metabolic pathways to drive gene clustering."
https://openalex.org/W2783504562,"Yet another theory of liquid water structure raises questions about interdisciplinarity, drug design, astrobiology, molecular biology, geochemistry and more. Over a billion people around the world lack access to safe drinking water and over two billion have little or no sanitation. Do we have the resources — and the will — to provide the water to support a booming population? This issue of Nature (see introduction, p. 269 and Editorial, p. 253) tackles the science, economics and politics of the global water crisis. Climate scientists say that unreliable rains and drier summer soils will become more common: Quirin Schiermeier reports on water strategies for a drier world. The pressure is on farmers to get maximum crop yields with minimum water use. As Emma Marris reports, the collaboration between plant breeders, agronomists and geneticists to that end has been far from smooth. As the population of India grows, the demand for water keeps rising. Daemon Fairless investigates an ambitious plan to redistribute the country's water supplies by linking rivers in a vast canal network. Jamie Bartram says it is time to improve the global targets for access to water and sanitation to make them relevant to all. In most countries, crop irrigation accounts for most freshwater use — more than drinking water and domestic consumption — but water use in energy production is catching up fast. Mike Hightower and Suzanne Pierce describe the measures being developed to economize on water use in the energy sector. The need for research into water purification is pressing. In an extensive Review Article, Mark Shannon et al. highlight the developing technologies that — it is hoped — can provide our drinking water in the decades ahead. Water is (almost) everywhere, yet physicists still trade theory and counter theory to explain its structure: Phil Ball explains. And Books & Arts looks at a documentary on water security, and at art inspired by water's surprising patterns. Go to http://www.nature.com/news/specials/water/index.html for the on-line start-page."
https://openalex.org/W1996457750,"The transcription factor REST plays important roles in opposing neuronal differentiation and in some human tumours. β-TrCP is identified as an important regulator of REST degradation. The RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST, also known as NRSF) is a master repressor of neuronal gene expression and neuronal programmes in non-neuronal lineages1,2,3. Recently, REST was identified as a human tumour suppressor in epithelial tissues4, suggesting that its regulation may have important physiological and pathological consequences. However, the pathways controlling REST have yet to be elucidated. Here we show that REST is regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and use an RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify a Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein complex containing the F-box protein β-TRCP (SCFβ-TRCP) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for REST degradation. β-TRCP binds and ubiquitinates REST and controls its stability through a conserved phospho-degron. During neural differentiation, REST is degraded in a β-TRCP-dependent manner. β-TRCP is required for proper neural differentiation only in the presence of REST, indicating that β-TRCP facilitates this process through degradation of REST. Conversely, failure to degrade REST attenuates differentiation. Furthermore, we find that β-TRCP overexpression, which is common in human epithelial cancers, causes oncogenic transformation of human mammary epithelial cells and that this pathogenic function requires REST degradation. Thus, REST is a key target in β-TRCP-driven transformation and the β-TRCP–REST axis is a new regulatory pathway controlling neurogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2014622924,"To explore the basis of metastasis, we compared the human breast cancer lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB453, which have low invasive ability, with their sublines MCF7-I4 and MDA-MB453-I4 with high invasive ability for gene expression and signaling pathways. We previously showed that the I4 lines had dramatically elevated levels of Twist compared with their parental lines. In this study, we observed significantly increased STAT3 Tyr(705) phosphorylation, but not the STAT3 protein levels, in the I4 lines. Activation of STAT3 by interleukin-6 or expression of activated Src induced Twist expression at protein and mRNA levels. Inhibiting STAT3 by a small molecule inhibitor, JSI-124, STAT3 small hairpin RNAs, or dominant negative STAT3 resulted in significant reduction of Twist protein and mRNA expression. STAT3 directly bound to the second proximal STAT3-binding site on the human Twist promoter and activated its transcriptional activity. Inhibition of STAT3 reduced migration, invasion, and colony formation of the I4 cells. Ectopic expression of Twist significantly rescued those phenotypes. Ten normal and 46 tumor specimens of breast tissues were examined for activation of STAT3 and expression of Twist. There was a strong correlation between Tyr(705) p-STAT3 and Twist level in the late stage tumor tissues. Our results indicate that activated STAT3 transcriptionally induces Twist, which plays an important role in promoting migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth. Together with our previous observation that Twist transcriptionally induces AKT2 to mediate Twist-promoted oncogenic functions, we conclude that STAT3, Twist, and AKT2 form a functional signaling axis to regulate pivotal oncogenic properties of cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2015357656,"We have demonstrated previously that a wide array of stress signals induces O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) expression and increases O-GlcNAcylation of many intracellular proteins, a response that is critical for cell survival. Here, we describe a mechanism by which glucose deprivation induces OGT expression and activity in Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells. Glucose deprivation increases OGT mRNA and protein expression in an AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent manner, whereas OGT enzymatic activity is regulated in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. OGT is not phosphorylated by p38, but rather it interacts directly with p38 through its C terminus; this interaction increases with p38 activation during glucose deprivation. Surprisingly, the catalytic activity of OGT, as measured toward peptide substrates, is not altered by glucose deprivation. Instead, p38 regulates OGT activity within the cell by recruiting it to specific targets, including neurofilament H. Neurofilament H is O-GlcNAcylated during glucose deprivation in a p38-dependent manner. Interestingly, neurofilament H solubility is increased by glucose deprivation in an O-GlcNAc-dependent manner, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation of neurofilament H regulates its disassembly from filaments. Not only do these data help to reveal how OGT is regulated by stress, but these findings also describe a possible mechanism by which defective brain glucose metabolism, as found in aging and ischemia, may directly affect axonal structure."
https://openalex.org/W1979799592,"REST/NRSF (repressor-element-1-silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencing factor) negatively regulates the transcription of genes containing RE1 sites. REST is expressed in non-neuronal cells and stem/progenitor neuronal cells, in which it inhibits the expression of neuron-specific genes. Overexpression of REST is frequently found in human medulloblastomas and neuroblastomas, in which it is thought to maintain the stem character of tumour cells. Neural stem cells forced to express REST and c-Myc fail to differentiate and give rise to tumours in the mouse cerebellum. Expression of a splice variant of REST that lacks the carboxy terminus has been associated with neuronal tumours and small-cell lung carcinomas, and a frameshift mutant (REST-FS), which is also truncated at the C terminus, has oncogenic properties. Here we show, by using an unbiased screen, that REST is an interactor of the F-box protein beta-TrCP. REST is degraded by means of the ubiquitin ligase SCF(beta-TrCP) during the G2 phase of the cell cycle to allow transcriptional derepression of Mad2, an essential component of the spindle assembly checkpoint. The expression in cultured cells of a stable REST mutant, which is unable to bind beta-TrCP, inhibited Mad2 expression and resulted in a phenotype analogous to that observed in Mad2(+/-) cells. In particular, we observed defects that were consistent with faulty activation of the spindle checkpoint, such as shortened mitosis, premature sister-chromatid separation, chromosome bridges and mis-segregation in anaphase, tetraploidy, and faster mitotic slippage in the presence of a spindle inhibitor. An indistinguishable phenotype was observed by expressing the oncogenic REST-FS mutant, which does not bind beta-TrCP. Thus, SCF(beta-TrCP)-dependent degradation of REST during G2 permits the optimal activation of the spindle checkpoint, and consequently it is required for the fidelity of mitosis. The high levels of REST or its truncated variants found in certain human tumours may contribute to cellular transformation by promoting genomic instability."
https://openalex.org/W2000187136,"Autophagy is an evolutionally conserved process for the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic proteins and organelles. Recent observations indicate that autophagy is induced in response to cellular insults that result in the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the signaling mechanisms that activate autophagy under these conditions are not understood. Here, we report that ER stress-induced autophagy requires the activation of protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ), a member of the noveltype PKC family. Induction of ER stress by treatment with either thapsigargin or tunicamycin activated autophagy in immortalized hepatocytes as monitored by the conversion LC3-I to LC3-II, clustering of LC3 into dot-like cytoplasmic structures, and electron microscopic detection of autophagosomes. Pharmacological inhibition of PKCθ or small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of PKCθ prevented the autophagic response to ER stress. Treatment with ER stressors induced PKCθ phosphorylation within the activation loop and localization of phospho-PKCθ to LC3-containing dot structures in the cytoplasm. However, signaling through the known unfolded protein response sensors was not required for PKCθ activation. PKCθ activation and stress-induced autophagy were blocked by chelation of intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA-AM. PKCθ was not activated or required for autophagy in response to amino acid starvation. These observations indicate that Ca2+-dependent PKCθ activation is specifically required for autophagy in response to ER stress but not in response to amino acid starvation.

These observations indicate that Ca2+-dependent PKCθ activation is specifically required for autophagy in response to ER stress but not in response to amino acid starvation. Autophagy is a process by which intracellular material is recycled to supply the cell with nutrients and energy for survival under conditions of severe stress, such as amino acid starvation. Upon nutrient limitation, autophagy is induced through the proliferation of cell membranes that form the autophagosome for the engulfment of large intracellular protein complexes and subcellular organelles. The autophagosome docks and fuses with the lysosome to form the autolysosome that degrades its lumenal contents to recycle amino acids and fatty acids. This “self-eating” process is typically induced under conditions of nutrient starvation. However, autophagy also provides an essential role for the clearance of dead-ended protein aggregates that cannot be degraded by the concerted action of molecular chaperones and the proteasome, such as those that occur in Huntington disease and Parkinson disease, (1Mizushima N. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2007; 27: 19-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 2He C. Klionsky D.J. ACS Chem. Biol. 2006; 1: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 3Levine B. Kroemer G. Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5589) Google Scholar). Because there is a growing understanding of the significance of autophagy in fundamental pathological conditions ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration, there is enthusiasm for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for these conditions (4Rubinsztein D.C. Gestwicki J.E. Murphy L.O. Klionsky D.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). However, although the molecular mechanisms that signal autophagy have been extensively characterized in budding yeast, the process in higher eukaryotes is largely not understood. Autophagy is induced by a group of evolutionarily conserved autophagy gene-related proteins (ATG proteins) (5Mizushima N. Levine B. Cuervo A.M. Klionsky D.J. Nature. 2008; 451: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (5182) Google Scholar). The process is initiated when a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex and ATG proteins form an isolation membrane. A ubiquitin-like protein conjugation pathway expands the isolation membrane. LC3 (microtubule-binding protein light chain 3; mammalian homolog of Atg8) is synthesized as an inactive soluble form (LC3-I) that is converted into an active membranous form (LC3-II) by modification with phosphatidylethanolamine. This modification is mediated by the ubiquitin-like conjugation system comprised of the E1-like ATG7 protein and the E2-like ATG3 protein. Phosphatidylethanolamine-modified LC3-II binds to target membranes and, in collaboration with ATG5-ATG12-ATG16 complexes, induces membrane alterations required for autophagosome formation. The molecular pathways that regulate autophagy are most well understood in the context of nutrient limitation. Autophagy is inhibited by depletion of cellular energy and amino acid levels through the target of rapamycin protein kinase TOR (target of rapamycin) (6Codogno P. Meijer A.J.

Conditions that disturb homeostasis in the ER, such as Ca2+ depletion from the ER or inhibition of asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation, cause the accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER lumen and activate an adaptive signaling pathway termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). In higher eukaryotes, the ER-resident transmembrane proteins IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6 act as proximal sensors to signal the UPR (21Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4879) Google Scholar, 22Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2006; 6: 5-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Upon accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER, the protein kinase PERK phosphorylates the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) at Ser51 to attenuate mRNA translation and thereby reduce the amount of the client proteins translocated into the ER lumen. The PERK-eIF2α pathway also up-regulates amino acid biosynthesis and anti-oxidative stress response genes through promoting preferential translation of ATF4 mRNA. In parallel, cleavage of ATF6α and IRE1α-mediated splicing of X-box-binding protein 1 (Xbp1) mRNA generate two transcription factors that induce expression of genes encoding ER molecular chaperones and ER-associated protein degradation machinery. In this way, the UPR couples the ER protein folding capacity with the protein folding demand. However, chronic unresolved accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER elicits an apoptotic program through ATF4- and ATF6α-mediated transcriptional activation of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein transcription factor CHOP/GADD153 (23Ma Y.

Oncogene. 2007; 27: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), ER stress-induced autophagy may also be mediated through CaMKK-β-mediated activation of AMP-activated protein kinase to inhibit mTOR kinase (14Hoyer-Hansen M.

Consequently, further studies are required to elucidate the molecular signaling processes by which ER stress induces autophagy. The ER is the major intracellular Ca2+ storage organelle of the cell. Ca2+ released from the ER activates members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family (33Gutcher I. Webb P.R. Anderson N.G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 34Sousa M. Barros A. Tesarik J. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1996; 2: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PKC isoforms function in multiple cellular processes including cell growth and differentiation, cell cycle control, ion flux, protein secretion, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis (33Gutcher I. Webb P.R.

Biochem. 2006; 17: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), although to date there are no studies that demonstrate a requirement for PKC signaling in the autophagic response. In mammals, the PKC family comprises 11 isoforms that are classified into three subgroups based on their domain structures. The classical PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ) possess both C1 and C2 domains that bind lipid cofactors (diacylglycerol) and Ca2+, respectively. In contrast, the novel PKCs (nPKC: δ, ϵ, η, μ, and θ) lack a C2 domain, and the atypical PKCs (ζ, λ, and ι) lack both C1 and C2 domains (42Liu W.S. Heckman C.A. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In addition to their diverse structures, the different PKC isoforms display different mechanisms of activation and tissue-specific expression (42Liu W.S. Heckman C.A. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Herein, we report that PKCθ, a member of the nPKC family, is a novel factor that mediates Ca2+-dependent induction of autophagy in response to ER stress but not in response to amino acid starvation. Chemical Reagents and Antibodies—Polyclonal antibody against ATG8/LC3 was kindly provided by Dr. Ron R. Kopito (Stanford University). Polyclonal antibodies against PKCθ, phospho-PKCθ (Thr538), PKCδ, phospho-PKCδ (Thr505), PKCα, phospho-PKCα/βI (Ser644/647), and ERK1/2 were purchased from Cell Signaling Inc. (Danvers, MA). Polyclonal antibody against Calnexin was purchased from Stressgen Biotechnologies Inc. (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal antibody against CHOP was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibody against α-actin was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Thapsigargin (TG), tunicamycin (TM), bafilomycin A1, and 3-methyladenine (3MA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Rottlerin and Go6976 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Cell Culture and Stress Treatments—Immortalized hepatocytes were maintained in medium 199 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% certified heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The cells were treated with TG or TM to induce ER stress. For transient treatment with TG, the cells were cultured in M199 medium containing 1 μm TG for 3 or 10 min, and then the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and cultured for 6 h in fresh M199 medium in the absence of TG. Where indicated, Go6976, rottlerin, BAPTA-AM, or 3MA was added to cell cultures for 20 min prior to the addition of TG or TM, and these agents were present during the entire time course of the experiment. For amino acid deprivation, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and cultured in Earlŉs balanced salt solution in the absence or presence of amino acids (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 10 nm bafilomycin A1. Primary Hepatocyte Isolation and Immortalization—Primary murine hepatocytes were isolated and immortalized as previously described (43Valverde A.M. Burks D.J. Fabregat I. Fisher T.L. Carretero J. White M.F. Benito M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2239-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 44Berry M.N. Edwards A.M. Barritt G.J. Isolated Hepatocytes: Preparation, Properties and Applications. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc, New York1991: 59-81Google Scholar). Briefly, livers from embryonic day 19 embryos were harvested and mechanically dissociated with a scalpel in 0.25% trypsin (Mg2+- and Ca2+-free). Hepatocytes were further dissociated from the liver pieces by gentle shaking at 37 °C for 10 min. The liver mass was permitted to settle to replace the trypsin solution with 0.05 mg/ml Liberase Blendzyme 4 solution (Roche Applied Science). After shaking at 37 °C for 20 min, the cells were dispersed by gentle pipetting and centrifuged at 50 × g for 5 min. Hepatocytes were plated onto collagen-coated plates (BD Bioscience) in M199 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and containing penicillin and streptomycin. After overnight incubation, the cultures were rinsed extensively to remove hematopoietic cells and other nonadherent cells. The puromycin resistance retroviral vector pBabe encoding SV40 large T antigen (a gift from P. Jat, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, London, UK) was transfected into viral PLAT-E packaging cells (kindly provided by D. Fang, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO) at 70% confluency using FuGENE 6. Medium containing virus was harvested and stored at 0 °C. Hepatocytes at 40% confluency were then infected by incubation with polybrene (8 μg/ml)-supplemented virus at 32 °C for 8 h and then transferred to 37 °C for 72 h prior to selection with puromycin (1 μg/ml) for 1 week. Generation of siRNA Knockdown Stable Cell Lines—siRNA-mediated knockdown was performed with pRNAT6.1/Neo (GeneScript, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). siRNA expression plasmids were constructed according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. Briefly, 70 bases of siRNA primers were designed by siRNA Target Finder and siRNA Construct Builder (GeneScript, Inc.). The nucleotide sequences of the inserted siRNA were: PKCθ si1 (5′-GATCCCGTTTATCAATGCACTTCTTGTGTTGATATCCGCACAAGAAGTGCATTGATAAATTTTTTCCAAA), PKCθ si2 (5′-GATCCCGTTTATACCACAAAGATTGGCATTGATATCCGTGCCAATCTTTGTGGTATAAATTTTTTCCAAA), and GFP (5′-GATCCCGTAGTTGCCGTCGTCCTTGAAGTTGATATCCGCTTCAAGGACGACGGCAACTATTTTTTCCAAA). A pair of primers was annealed in 1× SSC solution (150 mm sodium chloride, 15 mm sodium citrate) and ligated into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pRNAT-6.1/Neo using the Rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche Applied Science). Purified plasmid DNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing and transfected into the immortalized hepatocytes using FuGENE 6.0 (Roche Applied Science). Immortalized clones were selected in medium containing 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) maintained in medium containing 200 μg/ml Geneticin and analyzed by immunoblotting. Cell Survival Assay—3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assays were performed using the Cell Titer 96 AQueous One solution reagent (Promega Inc., Madison, WI) as described by the supplier. Briefly, the cells were plated onto 96-well tissue culture plates (100 μl of medium/well) and propagated to ∼50% confluency. The cells were then treated with TG or TM with or without 10 mm 3MA, as described in the figure legends. Cell Titer reagent (10 μl) was added into each well and incubated for 2 h. A595 nm was measured using a VERSA-max microplate reader (Molecular Device, Sunnyvale, CA). Immunoblotting and Immunofluorescence Analysis—For immunoblotting analysis, the cells were harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5%DOC, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 50 mm NaF. The protein concentrations were measured using the Dc protein assay system (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The transferred membranes were incubated with blocking solution (5% bovine serum albumin, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20), treated with primary antibodies (diluted with blocking buffer, 1:250 for α-CHOP antibody, 1:5000 for α-actin and α-LC3 antibody, 1:1000 for all other antibodies), and treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Promega) as secondary antibodies for detection. Gel images were developed using BioMax MR film (Kodak, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and an M35A X-Omat processor (Kodak). For immunofluorescence analysis, the cells were cultured to ∼80% confluency using the LabTek-II Chamber Slide System (Nalge Nunc International Inc., Rochester, NY). After stress treatment, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Chamber slides were incubated with blocking solution (2% bovine serum albumin in PBS), treated with primary antibody (1:1000 dilution for all of antibodies except for 1:5000 dilution for α-LC3 antibody), and treated with Alexa Fluor (488 or 594) anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) as the secondary antibody. Microscopic observation was performed using an Olympus BX-51 research microscope (Olympus Imaging America, Center Valley, PA). Electron Microscopy—For transmission electron microscopy, cell monolayers were rinsed in serum-free medium and then fixed for 1 h at room temperature in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m Sorensenŉs buffer, pH 7.4. Following a buffer rinse, the cells were post-fixed for 15 min in 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer. The cells were then rinsed in double-distilled water, en bloc stained for 1 h with a saturated, aqueous solution of uranyl acetate, scraped from the culture dishes, and collected by centrifugation in Eppendorf tubes. For each subsequent step, the cells were resuspended in the next reagent and then centrifuged. The cells were dehydrated rapidly in a graded series of ethanol, infiltrated and embedded in Epon, and polymerized. Ultra-thin sections were collected onto copper grids and poststained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The sections were viewed on a Philips CM100 at 60 kV. The images were recorded digitally using a Hamamatsu ORCA-HR digital camera system with AMT software (Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp., Danvers, MA). Subcellular Fractionation—TG-treated immortalized hepatocytes were harvested by scraping in PBS and collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min. After the supernatant was removed, the cells were resuspended in three volumes of 1× hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mm EGTA, and 25 mm potassium chloride) and then incubated on ice for 20 min. The cell suspensions were centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min, and the pellets were resuspended in two volumes of 1× isotonic buffer (1× hypotonic buffer with 250 mm sucrose) and subjected to Dounce homogenization. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove the cell debris, and the supernatants were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min to obtain the post-mitochondrial supernatant fractions. The supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to isolate the supernatant cytosolic fractions. Then pellets were resuspended in isotonic buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain the microsomal pellet fractions. Equal percentages of the cytosolic fractions and microsomal fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. All of the procedures for the cells fractionation were performed on ice with Complete-mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 50 mm sodium fluoride. The Autophagic Response Is Induced by ER Stress—Recently, it was demonstrated that ER stress induces autophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cells (17Bernales S. McDonald K.L. Walter P.

In mammalian cells, autophagy is detected by phosphatidylethanolamine addition to LC3 and its relocalization to membranes (45Tanida I. Ueno T. Kominami E. Int J Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2503-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). LC3-I and LC3-II are distinguishable by SDS-PAGE because of increased mobility of LC3-II that occurs as a consequence of increased hydrophobicity caused by lipidation. In addition, the distribution of LC3 changes from a diffuse cytoplasmic localization to dot-like structures that represent the autophagosome. We measured LC3 modification and localization in immortalized hepatocytes in response to the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor TG. Treatment with 1 μm TG for 8 h caused conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and LC3 localization to dot structures in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, A-C). Treatment with 5 mm 3MA, an inhibitor of class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (encoded by a single gene, the mammalian homolog of VPS34) that prevents autophagosome formation, partially inhibited the TG-dependent production of LC3-II and LC3 localization to dot structures (Fig. 1, A-C). Ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy detected the presence of numerous double membrane-enclosed vesicles that contained membranous and cytoplasmic material in TG-treated cells (Fig. 1D, panels b-d). These structures are characteristic of autophagosomes. In addition, TG tr"
https://openalex.org/W2149555430,"Nuclear translocation of β-catenin is a hallmark of Wnt signaling and is associated with various cancers. In addition to the canonical Wnt pathway activated by Wnt ligands, growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) also induce β-catenin dissociation from the adherens junction complex, translocation into the nucleus, and activation of target genes such as c-myc. Here we report that EGF-induced β-catenin nuclear localization and activation of c-myc are dependent on the deacetylase HDAC6. We show that EGF induces HDAC6 translocation to the caveolae membrane and association with β-catenin. HDAC6 deacetylates β-catenin at lysine 49, a site frequently mutated in anaplastic thyroid cancer, and inhibits β-catenin phosphorylation at serine 45. HDAC6 inactivation blocks EGF-induced β-catenin nuclear localization and decreases c-Myc expression, leading to inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. These results suggest that EGF-induced nuclear localization of β-catenin is regulated by HDAC6-dependent deacetylation and provide a new mechanism by which HDAC inhibitors prevent tumor growth.

Pelicci P.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). However, the role of HDACs in tumorigenesis and the key targets for HDAC action are not yet fully understood, making it difficult to select patients who are most likely to respond to HDAC inhibitors. Historically, histones were perceived to be the most important substrates of HDACs, if not the sole substrate. Recent studies, however, have revealed that HDACs have many non-histone substrates involved in a much broader array of biological processes (2Cohen T. Yao T.P. Science's STKE. 2004; 2004: pe42PubMed Google Scholar). The best example is the cytoplasmic deacetylase HDAC6, which has been implicated in the regulation of microtubules, growth factor-induced chemotaxis, and misfolded protein stress response (3Bali P.

Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling plays a central role in both normal development and tumor formation. Aberrant activation of Wnt signaling has been associated with multiple types of cancer (9Bienz M. Clevers H. Cell. 2000; 103: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar, 10Clevers H. Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4518) Google Scholar). The key player in Wnt cascade is β-catenin, a cytoplasmic protein whose stability is regulated by the destruction complex, consisting of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli protein, Axin, casein kinase 1 (CK1), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). In unstimulated cells, β-catenin is associated with the destruction complex, allowing CK1 to phosphorylate β-catenin at Ser-45, a residue often mutated in cancers (11Amit S. Hatzubai A. Birman Y. Andersen J.S. Ben-Shushan E. Mann M. Ben-Neriah Y. Alkalay I. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1066-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 12Liu C. Li Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X. Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). Subsequently, GSK3 phosphorylates additional serine and threonine residues near the N terminus of β-catenin, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation. Activation of the Wnt signaling pathway inhibits the kinase activity of the destruction complex by an unknown mechanism. As a consequence, stabilized β-catenin accumulates and translocates to the nucleus, where it forms complexes with the TCF/LEF-1 transcription factors and activates target genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1 (13He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). In addition to its function in Wnt signaling, β-catenin also binds to E-cadherin and plays an essential role in cell-cell adherens junctions (14Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that EGF induces breakup of cell-cell junctions and increases the level of nuclear β-catenin, either by direct release of the junctional β-catenin from the membrane-bound pool or by activating E-cadherin endocytosis (15Lu Z. Ghosh S. Wang Z. Hunter T. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 499-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). EGF receptor overexpression has been reported in many human tumors and correlates with poor clinical prognosis. EGF-induced release of β-catenin from the adherens junction not only contributes to epithelial-mesenchymal transition but also provides an alternative mechanism for activating β-catenin signaling. This cross-talk between EGF and Wnt signaling could represent an important mechanism underlying the effect of EGF during tumor development. Here we report that EGF-induced β-catenin nuclear localization and c-myc expression are dependent on HDAC6. We found that EGF stimulates HDAC6-dependent deacetylation of β-catenin at Lys-49. This deacetylation leads to a reduction in β-catenin phosphorylation and promotes β-catenin nuclear accumulation. We showed that inactivation of HDAC6 inhibits β-catenin nuclear localization and c-myc induction. Our data suggest that HDAC6 is an important link between EGF and Wnt signaling. Cell Culture—HCT116, SW480, and 293Tcells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated in serum-free medium overnight prior EGF treatment (1 μm) or preincubated with trichostatin A (TSA) (400 nm) for 8 h. Reagents—EGF and TSA were from Cell Signaling Technology (CST). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin was purchased from Sigma. All antibodies used in this study, except for HDAC6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Ac-tubulin (Dr. Yao), were from CST. The acetylated β-catenin (Lys-49) was raised by immunizing rabbit with a synthetic peptide containing acetylated lysine 49. β-Catenin plasmids were provided by Dr. C. Neuveut (Institute of Pasteur). All siRNAs were from CST. Transfections of siRNA was performed using Mirus reagents. DNA plasmids were transformed with FuGENE 6 from Roche Applied Science. Cell Fractionation—Nuclear fractionation was performed as described (16Lo H.W. Hsu S.C. Ali-Seyed M. Gunduz M. Xia W. Wei Y. Bartholomeusz G. Shih J.Y. Hung M.C. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 575-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were treated as indicated, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and swelled in hypotonic buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotinin) for 30 min on ice. Following homogenization, the nuclei were pelleted at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min to remove cell debris and solubilized with SDS lysis buffer, and the resulting lysates were collected as cytosolic lysates. Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunostaining—Assays were carried out following the standard protocols of CST. In the colon cancer cell line HCT116, the protein level of c-Myc was significantly decreased when cells were treated with β-catenin siRNA (Fig. 1a), indicating that c-Myc expression is dependent on β-catenin. As expected, EGF treatment increased c-Myc protein level (Fig. 1b). The basal level of c-Myc under starvation conditions may reflect that HCT116 has a heterozygous serine 45 deletion mutation on β-catenin, which could lead to constitutive transcription of c-Myc (21Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3505) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this EGF-enhanced c-Myc expression was inhibited by treatment with the HDAC inhibitor TSA, although TSA had no effect on the protein level of β-catenin (Fig. 1b). Immunoprecipitation of β-catenin from these cell lysates revealed the accumulation of acetylated β-catenin after TSA treatment (Fig. 1b), suggesting a role of acetylation in β-catenin-dependent c-Myc expression. Similar results were obtained from another colon cancer cell line, SW480 (Fig. 1b, right panel). TSA inhibition of c-Myc expression prompted us to test whether TSA blocks EGF-induced β-catenin nuclear translocation. To this end, we examined the subcellular localization of β-catenin after TSA treatment. Immunostaining showed that β-catenin was primarily present at the cell surface in untreated cells (Fig. 1c). Consistent with previous work, β-catenin membrane staining was reduced after EGF treatment, whereas its nuclear staining was increased (Fig. 1c). However, when cells were treated with TSA, EGF-induced redistribution of β-catenin was inhibited. In addition, cellular fractionation showed that EGF treatment increased the level of nuclear β-catenin, and this increase was inhibited by TSA (Fig. 1d). In contrast, the level of cytosolic β-catenin was slightly decreased after EGF treatment, and it is restored by TSA (Fig. 1d). The effect of TSA suggests that HDACs might be involved in EGF-induced β-catenin nuclear accumulation. To test this, we first asked whether specific HDACs interact with β-catenin. In a time course study, β-catenin was immunoprecipitated from HCT116 cells after EGF treatment and immunoblotted with antibodies against HDACs. Among the HDACs tested (HDAC1–7), only HDAC6 was coimmunoprecipitated with β-catenin (data not shown), and importantly, this interaction was induced by EGF (Fig. 2a). The association between HDAC6 and β-catenin raises the possibility that β-catenin might be a substrate of HDAC6. To test this, we used siRNA to inhibit HDAC6 expression. As shown in Fig. 2b, β-catenin acetylation levels were significantly increased in HCT116 cells transfected with HDAC6 siRNA, indicating that HDAC6 can function as a β-catenin deacetylase in vivo. We next attempted to identify which lysine residues of β-catenin were deacetylated by HDAC6. Four lysines on β-catenin have been identified as acetylation sites (17Wolf D. Rodova M. Miska E.A.

In this study, we focused on lysine 49 for the following reasons. 1) Lys-49 of β-catenin is conserved from Drosophila to human (Fig. 2c). 2) Lys-49 is adjacent to the highly conserved regulatory serine and threonine residues in the N terminus. 3) Lysine to arginine transition at Lys-49 (K49R) is the most frequent mutation in thyroid carcinomas patients (20Garcia-Rostan G. Tallini G. Herrero A. D'Aquila T.G. Carcangiu M.L. Rimm D.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1811-1815PubMed Google Scholar). 4) K49R mutation enhances the ability of β-catenin to activate c-myc (17Wolf D. Rodova M. Miska E.A. Calvet J.P. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25562-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody specifically recognizing Lys-49 acetylated β-catenin was generated and tested for specificity. 293T cells were transfected with Myc-tagged wild-type and K49R β-catenin. Myc immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot with the acetylated-Lys-49-specific antibody. Fig. 2d shows that wild-type β-catenin, but not K49R mutant, was detected by the Ac-β-catenin (Lys-49) antibody, demonstrating the specificity of this antibody. We then used this antibody to determine whether acetylation of Lys-49 is regulated by HDAC6. Consistent with previous work (17Wolf D. Rodova M. Miska E.A. Calvet J.P. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25562-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), acetylation of β-catenin at Lys-49 was increased by transfecting cells with HA-CBP (Fig. 2e). The amount of Ac-β-catenin (Lys-49), however, was significantly reduced when cells were cotransfected with wild-type HDAC6 but not with a catalytically inactive HDAC6 mutant (Fig. 2e). We also examined the ability of endogenous HDAC6 to deacetylate β-catenin at Lys-49. As shown in Fig. 2f (left panel), Lys-49 was deacetylated after EGF treatment in HCT116 cells, and this EGF-induced Lys-49 deacetylation was blocked by HDAC6 siRNA. Consistently, EGF mediated Lys-49 deacetylation was also blocked by TSA treatment in SW480 cells (Fig. 2f, right panel). These results demonstrate that HDAC6 is an endogenous β-catenin deacetylase. CK1-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin at serine 45 is required for β-catenin degradation, and mutations at this site frequently occur in colon cancer (11Amit S. Hatzubai A. Birman Y.

Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3505) Google Scholar). Given the proximity of Lys-49 to Ser-45, we examined whether HDAC6 affects the phosphorylation of Ser-45. 293T cells were transfected with Myc-tagged wild-type β-catenin and FLAG-tagged HDAC6. Myc immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting with pS45 phospho-specific antibodies. Fig. 2g showed that overexpression of HDAC6 suppressed Ser-45 phosphorylation in vivo. Consistently, phosphorylation of Ser-45 is also blocked by the K49R mutation (Fig. 2d), suggesting that Lys-49 deacetylation by HDAC6 had an inhibitory effect on Ser-45 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we observed increased levels of c-Myc in serum-starved SW480 cells overexpressing HDAC6 (Fig. 2h). Together, these results show that deacetylation of Lys-49 by HDAC6 inhibits β-catenin phosphorylation at Ser-45, leading to β-catenin-dependent c-Myc induction. How does EGF regulate HDAC6-dependent β-catenin deacetylation? It has been shown that β-catenin is concentrated in caveolae membranes (22Galbiati F. Volonte D. Brown A.M. Weinstein D.E. Ben-Ze'ev A. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23368-23377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the possibility of a caveolae-dependent mechanism for EGF-induced HDAC6/β-catenin association. To this end, we examined the effect of EGF on HDAC6 interaction with caveolin-1, a major component of caveolae membranes. After EGF treatment, we immunoprecipitated caveolin-1 and immunoblotting with HDAC6 and β-catenin antibodies. Although association of β-catenin and caveolin-1 was not affected by EGF treatment, the level of coimmunoprecipitated HDAC6-caveolin-1 complex was significantly enhanced by 30 min of EGF treatment, and this complex dissociated 60 min after EGF stimulation (Fig. 3a). Interaction between HDAC6 and caveolin-1 was blocked by treatment with the cholesterol-sequestering reagent β-cyclodextrin, which is known to disrupt cholesterol-rich caveolae (Fig. 3b). Thus, we conclude that EGF regulates HDAC6 function by recruiting HDAC6 to caveolae membranes. To confirm that HDAC6 is required for EGF-induced β-catenin nuclear localization, HDAC6 siRNA was introduced into HCT116 cells, and the nuclear fraction was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3c, HDAC6 siRNA blocked EGF-induced deacetylation of Lys-49 and reduced the amount of nuclear β-catenin in EGF-treated cells. Subsequently, HDAC6 reduction resulted in decreased c-Myc expression (Fig. 3c) and an ∼50% decrease in cell number (Fig. 3d), demonstrating that HDAC6 is required for cell proliferation. The significant reduction of cell number does not appear to be due to apoptosis since we did not detect any caspase activation in HDAC6 siRNA-transfected cells (data not shown). In addition, both HDAC6 and β-catenin siRNAs exhibited similar effects on growth inhibition, and cotransfection of both siRNAs gave no additive effect (Fig. 3d), suggesting that both genes function in the same pathway. Recent studies suggest that protein deacetylation has diverse biological functions beyond histone modification (2Cohen T. Yao T.P. Science's STKE. 2004; 2004: pe42PubMed Google Scholar). Here we found that HDAC6 is involved in EGF-induced β-catenin nuclear localization; EGF stimulates HDAC6 translocation to the plasma membrane, where it deacetylates β-catenin at Lys-49, inhibits its phosphorylation at Ser-45, and promotes its nuclear accumulation. Our data identified HDAC6 as a link between EGF and Wnt signaling that has been implicated in tumor progression. Given that HDAC6 is not an essential gene in mouse, 3Y. Gao and T. P. Yao, personal communication. we suspect that HDAC6 might not play a dominant role in the canonical Wnt-β-catenin signaling during normal development. If true, our study would suggest that pharmacological inactivation of HDAC6 could offer therapeutic effects to tumors with deregulated EGF-β-catenin signaling.

E-cadherin, an important mediator of cell-cell adhesions, has been shown to be cleaved by γ-secretase. This cleavage releases a fragment of E-cadherin, E-cadherin C-terminal fragment 2 (E-cad/CTF2), into the cytosol. Here, we study the fate and function of this fragment. First, we show that coexpression of the cadherin-binding protein, p120 catenin (p120), enhances the nuclear translocation of E-cad/CTF2. By knocking down p120 with short interfering RNA, we also demonstrate that p120 is necessary for the nuclear localization of E-cad/CTF2. Furthermore, p120 enhances and is required for the specific binding of E-cad/CTF2 to DNA. Finally, we show that E-cad/CTF2 can regulate the p120-Kaiso-mediated signaling pathway in the nucleus.

In multicellular organisms, individual cells are often connected with each other via cell-cell adhesions to form three-dimensionally structured tissues or organs. Formation of tight and compact cell-cell adhesions suppresses free cell movement and provides cells with a positional cue for the establishment of cell polarity. In addition to the structural roles, it has been long known that cell-cell contacts play an important role in various signal transduction pathways (1Jamora C. Fuchs E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 2Fagotto F. Gumbiner B.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In other words, through cell-cell contacts, cells can exchange a variety of information with their neighbors to behave properly in their community. Cadherins are a family of transmembrane cell-cell adhesion proteins that can be subdivided into several groups including classical cadherins and protocadherins (3Yagi T. Takeichi M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1169-1180PubMed Google Scholar). Classical cadherins, of which E-cadherin is the best characterized, play a crucial role in mediating cell-cell contacts at adherens junctions. The extracellular domains of classical cadherins form homophilic ligations. The cytoplasmic domain of cadherin includes two cadherin homology (CH) 2The abbreviations used are: CH, cadherin homology; ADAM10, a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10; CBP, CREB-binding protein; E-cad/CTF, E-cadherin C-terminal fragment; HEK, human embryonic kidney; Hmat, human matrilysin; p120, p120-catenin; siRNA, short interfering RNA; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; TCF/LEF-1, T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor-1; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; NLS, nuclear localization signal. domains: CH2 domain (located at the membrane proximal region) and CH3 domain (located at the distal region). These domains are conserved between classical cadherins. The CH2 and CH3 domains of cadherins interact with p120-catenin (p120) and β-catenin, respectively (4McCrea P.D. Turck C.W. Gumbiner B. Science. 1991; 254: 1359-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 5Reynolds A.B. Daniel J. McCrea P.D. Wheelock M.J. Wu J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the CH2 domain of E-cadherin also interacts with Hakai (6Fujita Y. Krause G. Scheffner M. Zechner D. Leddy H.E. Behrens J.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3259-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cadherins, especially classical cadherins, have been shown to be involved in several signaling pathways regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (8Larue L. Antos C. Butz S.

However, the molecular mechanisms whereby cadherins regulate varied cellular processes are not fully understood. The cytoplasmic domain of cadherins does not possess any intrinsic enzymatic activity that could directly mediate signaling pathways in the cytosol. However, cadherin-binding proteins, especially β-catenin and p120, have been shown to localize in the nucleus and play a key role in signal transduction. The crucial role of β-catenin in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway has been well characterized (12Brembeck F.H. Rosario M. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 13Willert K. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1394-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). When cells are stimulated with Wnt, β-catenin is translocated into the nucleus where it binds a transcription factor, T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor-1 (TCF/LEF-1), and acts as a transcriptional activator (14Molenaar M. van de Wetering M.

Biol. 1999; 19: 3614-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The interaction with p120 prevents Kaiso from binding to DNA and thus suppresses the repressor activity of Kaiso (16Kelly K.F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2911-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The Kaiso-p120 complex was recently shown to regulate both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways (20Kim S.W. Park J.I. Spring C.M. Sater A.K. Ji H. Otchere A.A. Daniel J.M. McCrea P.D.

Although the functional roles of cadherin-binding proteins in the nucleus have been intensively studied, it is not clear whether the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin itself has a signaling role in the nucleus. Cadherin-based cell-cell contacts are dynamically regulated. Cadherin at cell-cell contacts can be down-regulated by transcriptional repression and endocytosis (6Fujita Y. Krause G. Scheffner M.

Moreover, cadherins are proteolytically cleaved by a number of proteases including extracellular metalloproteases, γ-secretase, and caspase (24Lochter A. Galosy S. Muschler J. Freedman N. Werb Z.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This is best characterized in Notch signaling where the γ-secretase-cleaved intracellular Notch fragment translocates to the nucleus and regulates gene transcription (29Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A.

Development. 2007; 134: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For all these transmembrane molecules, intracellular domain fragments resulting from γ-secretase cleavage are translocated to the nucleus and have signaling functions. In particular, γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of N-cadherin in neural crest cells, induced by bone morphogenic protein 4, leads to nuclear translocation of the released cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin (38Shoval I. Ludwig A. Kalcheim C. Development. 2007; 134: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of γ-protocadherins also localizes in the nucleus and activates the promoter of γ-protocadherin locus (37Hambsch B. Grinevich V. Seeburg P.H. Schwarz M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15888-15897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, no signaling function for the cleaved cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin has been described. In this study, we show that the intracellular domain of E-cadherin released by γ-secretase cleavage can localize in the nucleus and that this localization is specifically enhanced by p120. p120 also promotes the interaction of E-cadherin with DNA. We demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin in the nucleus modulates the p120-Kaiso-mediated signaling pathway. Finally, we present data suggesting a possible role of nuclear E-cadherin in the regulation of apoptosis.

A431 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and ambient air supplemented with 5% CO2. MDCK, MCF-7, COS-1, and L fibroblast cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. HEK293 cells were transfected as previously described (43Schaeper U. Gehring N.H. Fuchs K.P. Sachs M. Kempkes B. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). MDCK cells stably expressing E-cadherin-myc were produced and cultured as previously described (42Dupre-Crochet S. Figueroa A. Hogan C. Ferber E.C. Bialucha C.U. Adams J. Richardson E.C. Fujita Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3804-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To obtain L fibroblast cell lines stably expressing NLS-tagged E-cad/CTF2, cells were transfected with pcDNA4/TO/GFP-E-cad/CTF2-NLS, and stably transfected cells were selected in medium containing 400 μg ml–1 zeocin (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (40Hogan C. Serpente N. Cogram P. Hosking C.R. Bialucha C.U. Feller S.M. Braga V.M. Birchmeier W. Fujita Y. Mol. Cell.

To obtain epifluorescence images, we used a Zeiss Axipoplan2 microscope using a 40 × 1.3 oil immersion objective at room temperature (Zeiss). Images were captured using a C4742-95 digital camera (Hamamatsu) and Openlab software (Improvision). Confocal images were obtained with a Bio-Rad confocal mounted on a Nikon Optiphot 2 microscope using a 60 × 1.4 oil immersion objective at room temperature, or a Leica SPE confocal microscope with a 63 × 1.3 oil immersion objective at room temperature. Images were acquired using Laser Sharp software (Bio-Rad) or the Leica Application Suite, respectively. Merged images were split using Image J software (National Institutes of Health). Brightness and contrast were adjusted using Photoshop CS (Adobe). The ratio of nucleus/cytoplasm fluorescence intensity in confocal images were analyzed as described (18Hosking C.R. Ulloa F. Hogan C.

Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse Rhodamine Red-X, goat anti-rabbit Cy2, and goat anti-rat Cy2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). To visualize nuclei we used Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described (40Hogan C. Serpente N. Cogram P. Hosking C.R. Bialucha C.U. Feller S.M. Braga V.M. Birchmeier W. Fujita Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6690-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To obtain total cell lysates, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) containing 5 μg ml–1 leupeptin, 50 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 7.2 trypsin inhibitor units ml–1 of aprotinin, and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The suspended cells were directly boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. To ensure equal loading, the protein concentration of lysates was quantified using the DC Protein Assay reagent from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) and measured on a VERSAmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Densitometric analyses were performed with the Bio-Rad image acquisition system (Gel Doc 170) and Epson Expression 1680 Pro Scanner (Seiko Epson, Amsterdam, Netherlands), and Quantity One (Bio-Rad). The upsmear bands of E-cad/CTF2 shown in Fig. 4 were not observed in some experiments (e.g. supplemental Fig. S2B). It is highly likely that despite the addition of N-ethylmaleimide to inhibit de-ubiquitination, the de-modification of E-cad/CTF2 occurs very actively after lysing the cells, as the modified bands were frequently lost when the lysates were kept for a longer period. For DNA-cellulose binding assays, cell lysates (100 μg of protein) and/or purified GST or GST-E-cad/CTF2 protein (75 ng) were used in DNA-cellulose assays and competition assays as previously described (18Hosking C.R. Ulloa F. Hogan C. Ferber E.C. Figueroa A. Gevaert K. Birchmeier W. Briscoe J. Fujita Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1918-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Purified GST-E-cad/CTF2 and GST proteins were produced, and GST pull-down assays were performed as previously described (40Hogan C. Serpente N. Cogram P. Hosking C.R. Bialucha C.U. Feller S.M. Braga V.M. Birchmeier W. Fujita Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6690-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Nuclear Fractionation—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and trypsinized thoroughly until well separated. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 150 μl of 2× lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, and 2% Nonidet P-40) containing 5 μg ml–1 leupeptin, 50 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 7.2 trypsin inhibitor units ml–1 of aprotinin, and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Cells were then immediately triturated with a 25-gauge needle 12 times. After centrifugation at 110 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was removed and the pelleted nuclei were washed twice in 1× lysis buffer. The nuclear fractions were then boiled for 10 min with SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by Western blotting, or lysed in 1 ml of Triton X-100 lysis buffer followed by immunoprecipitation. Purity of nuclear fractions was confirmed by Western blotting with antibodies against several compartment-specific markers (supplemental Fig. S3A). RNA Interference—siRNA oligos for p120 (p120 siRNA1, CAGCAGAACUCCUCUUGGATT; p120 siRNA2, CAGCAGUCAUUCAUAUGAUTT) were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells using Hi-PerFect® reagent. 5 × 104 cells per well were plated in a 24-well dish. 1.5 μg of siRNA was used with 9 μl of Hi-PerFect reagent per well. As a negative control, we used the non-silencing control siRNA (AF 488) from Qiagen. 48 h after siRNA transfection, cells were further transfected with E-cad/CTF2. After a further 24 h, cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer or used for nuclear fractionation. Luciferase Reporter Assays—HEK293 and COS-1 cells were transfected with pGL3–4x KBS together with FLAG-p120, E-cad/CTF2, E-cad/CTF2-NLS-myc, or E-cad/CTF2(AAA)-NLS-myc. For reporter assays using the matrilysin promoter, HEK293 cells were transfected with pGL3-Basic-2.3kb HMat together with FLAG-p120, E-cad/CTF2-NLS-myc, or E-cad/CTF2(AAA)-NLS-myc. LacZ was used as a control for transfection efficiency in all experiments. Luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Turner Designs TD-20/20 luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using the β-galactosidase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) and the VERSAmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Statistical Analysis—Student's t tests assuming equal or unequal variance and a two-tailed distribution were performed for statistical analysis. Treatment with Staurosporine Induces γ-Secretase-mediated Cleavage of E-cadherin in Epithelial Cells—First, we examined the proteolytic cleavage of E-cadherin in several epithelial cell lines. As previously reported (25Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), treatment of the human epithelial cell line A431 with staurosporine lead to the production of cytoplasmic cleavage products, E-cadherin C-terminal fragment 2 (E-cad/CTF2) (33 kDa) and E-cadherin C-terminal fragment 3 (E-cad/CTF3) (29 kDa) (Fig. 1A). Staurosporine is a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C and other protein kinases, which strongly induces apoptosis. E-Cad/CTF2 was also observed in the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 and MDCK cells after treatment with staurosporine (Fig. 1A). A 38-kDa E-cadherin fragment known as E-cadherin C-terminal fragment 1 (E-cad/CTF1) was also present in all three cell lines (Fig. 1A). The identity of a number of other bands between 45 and 100 kDa, particularly in MDCK cells, is not known. The size and domain structure of E-cad/CTF1, E-cad/CTF2, and E-cad/CTF3 are shown in Fig. 1B. E-Cad/CTF1 is the cleavage product induced by extracellular metalloproteases that cleave close to the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane regions of E-cadherin (24Lochter A.

E-Cad/CTF3 results from cleavage by caspase-3 after induction of apoptosis (25Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z.

E-Cad/CTF2 is the result of γ-secretase cleavage, which occurs following removal of the extracellular region by metalloproteases (25Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The resulting E-cad/CTF2 fragment represents the entire intracellular domain of E-cadherin. As expected, we observed that treatment with γ-secretase inhibitor X specifically blocked staurosporine-induced production of E-cad/CTF2 in all three cell lines and lead to an accumulation of its precursor E-cad/CTF1 (Fig. 1A). p120 Enhances Nuclear Localization of E-cad/CTF2—To investigate a possible role for E-cad/CTF2 in signaling pathways, we studied whether it can localize in the nucleus, as has been observed for the γ-secretase cleavage products of N-cadherin and γ-protocadherins (35Uemura K.

When HA-E-cad/CTF2 alone is expressed in MDCK cells, it was mainly localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, we found that coexpression of p120 enhanced the nuclear localization of E-cad/CTF2 (Fig. 2A). To quantify this effect of p120, we measured the ratio of pixel intensity within defined regions of the nucleus and cytoplasm. The quantification results showed that coexpression of p120 significantly increased the amount of E-cad/CTF2 in the nucleus (p < 0.002) (Fig. 2A, right). A simi"

A primitive chordate (ascidian) Ciona intestinalis is an example of such an organism, but the molecular mechanism underlying its SI system is not known. Here, we show that the SI system is governed by two gene loci that act cooperatively. Each locus contains a tightly linked pair of polycystin 1-related receptor (s-Themis) and fibrinogen-like ligand (v-Themis) genes, the latter of which is located in the first intron of s-Themis but transcribed in the opposite direction. These genes may encode male- and female-side self-recognition molecules. The SI system of C. intestinalis has a similar framework to that of flowering plants but utilizing different molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2074827827,"Endocytosis of Trk (tropomyosin-related kinase) receptors is critical for neurotrophin signal transduction and biological functions. However, the mechanism governing endocytosis of TrkB (tropomyosin-related kinase B) and the specific contributions of TrkB endocytosis to downstream signaling are unknown. In this study, we report that blocking clathrin, dynamin, or AP2 in cultured neurons of the central nervous system inhibited brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced activation of Akt but not ERK. Treating neurons with the clathrin inhibitor monodansylcadaverine or a peptide that blocks dynamin function specifically abrogated Akt pathway activation in response to BDNF but did not affect the response of other downstream effectors or the up-regulation of immediate early genes neuropeptide Y and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein. Similar effects were found in neurons expressing small interfering RNA to silence AP2 or a dominant negative form of dynamin that inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In PC12 cells, ERK but not Akt activation required TrkA endocytosis following stimulation with nerve growth factor, whereas the opposite was true when TrkA-expressing neurons were stimulated with nerve growth factor in the central nervous system. Thus, the specific effects of internalized Trk receptors probably depend on the presence of cell type-specific modulators of neurotrophin signaling and not on differences inherent to Trk receptors themselves. Endocytosis-dependent activation of Akt in neurons was found to be critical for BDNF-supported survival and dendrite outgrowth. Together, these results demonstrate the functional requirement of clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis in generating the full intracellular response of neurons to BDNF in the central nervous system.

Neurotrophins initiate these cellular responses by binding to and activating specific tropomyosin-related kinases, known as Trk receptors. NGF is specific for TrkA, whereas BDNF and neurotrophin 4/5 are specific for TrkB. Neurotrophin 3 primarily activates TrkC but also activates other Trks with less efficiency. Neurotrophin binding to Trk induces Trk dimerization and autophosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain, creating docking sites for adaptor proteins that trigger activation of PI3K/Akt, MEK/ERK, and PLCγ signaling pathways (4Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar). Formation of the neurotrophin-Trk complex also initiates its endocytosis (5Ginty D.D. Segal R.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and endocytosis is required for some biological functions of neurotrophins (6Grimes M.L. Zhou J. Beattie E.C. Yuen E.C. Hall D.E. Valletta J.S. Topp K.S. LaVail J.H. Bunnett N.W. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7950-7964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has long been known that communication of neurotrophin signals from nerve terminals to neuronal cell bodies requires endocytosis and retrograde transport of neurotrophin-Trk complexes (7Zweifel L.S. Kuruvilla R. Ginty D.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Growing evidence suggests that internalization of neurotrophin-Trk complexes may also be a necessary step for activating some down-stream signaling pathways. For example, blocking TrkA endocytosis with pharmacological inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endocytosis or dominant-negative dynamin inhibits NGF-induced MEK/ERK phosphorylation in dorsal root ganglion neurons (8York R.D. Molliver D.C. Grewal S.S. Stenberg P.E. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8069-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), PC12 cells (9Zhang Y. Moheban D.B. Conway B.R. Bhattacharyya A. Segal R.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5671-5678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and sympathetic neurons (10MacInnis B.L. Campenot R.B. Science. 2002; 295: 1536-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Internalization of NGF-TrkA complexes is also required for NGF-induced differentiation (9Zhang Y. Moheban D.B. Conway B.R. Bhattacharyya A. Segal R.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5671-5678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulating cultured sympathetic neurons with NGF covalently cross-linked to beads that preclude ligand-receptor internalization promotes TrkA and Akt phosphorylation but not MEK/ERK phosphorylation that normally occurs in the presence of NGF (10MacInnis B.L. Campenot R.B. Science. 2002; 295: 1536-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These data suggest that endocytic trafficking of NGF-Trk complexes is necessary for the activation of some Trk downstream pathways but not others. It is currently unknown whether other neurotrophins-Trk complexes, such as BDNF-TrkB, depend on endocytosis for the activation of selective downstream signaling cascades. In the central nervous system, TrkB is widely expressed in cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons as well as cerebellar granule cells, whereas TrkA is restricted to small populations of neurons in other brain regions (11Barbacid M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1386-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar, 12Ip N.Y. Li Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Lindsay R.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3394-3405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endocytosis of BDNF-TrkB complexes has been reported. In cultured hippocampal neurons, exogenous BDNF promotes a rapid translocation of AP2 (adaptor protein 2) and clathrin to the plasma membrane (13Beattie E.C. Howe C.L. Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7325-7333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and both neuronal activity and Ca2+ influx facilitate TrkB endocytosis in the presence of BDNF (14Du J. Feng L. Zaitsev E. Je H.S. Liu X.W. Lu B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In cultured sensory neurons, BDNF induces rapid endocytosis and retrograde movement of TrkB in axons (15Heerssen H.M. Pazyra M.F. Segal R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 596-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that BDNF-induced TrkB endocytosis in cultured neurons of the central nervous system depends on clathrin, dynamin, and AP2, and blocking endocytosis prevents BDNF-induced activation of Akt but not ERK. Endocytosis inhibitors likewise block NGF-induced Akt activation in TrkA-expressing neurons of the central nervous system, whereas Erk activity is unaffected, the opposite effect as that observed in PC12 cells. Furthermore, we show that TrkB endocytosis is required for BDNF-induced neuronal protection and dendritic growth but not the up-regulation of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC). Together our results demonstrate that activation of Akt signaling down-stream of TrkB relies on ligand-receptor endocytosis for its initiation, and BDNF-TrkB endocytosis is a required step in the regulation of biological functions. Primary Cortical and Hippocampal Neuron Cultures—Cortical and hippocampal neurons were prepared from embryonic day 18 rat embryos and maintained for 10-12 days in vitro as described previously (16Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of hippocampal and cortical neurons were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well plates at 1.5 × 106 cells/well for biochemical experiments or on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips at 5,000 cells/coverslip for microscopic analysis. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Two hours prior to experimentation, cells were rinsed with serum-free media and then incubated in serum-free conditions. Monodansylcadaverine (MDC; 50 μm; Sigma) or dynamin proline-rich domain peptide (Dyn-pep; 50 μm; Princeton BioMolecules) was applied to the bath for 30 min prior to BDNF treatment (25 ng/ml; Sigma) to inhibit clathrin and dynamin, respectively. Cultures were treated with Trk inhibitor K252a (200 nm; Sigma), MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (10 μm; Sigma), or PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 (50 μm; Sigma) for 30 min prior to BDNF treatment. All pharmacological agents were dissolved in DMSO, and control cultures were stimulated with the same amount of DMSO solution. The Animal Experiment Committee of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences approved all experimental procedures. Primary Cerebellar Granule Neuron Cultures—Cerebellar granule cells were prepared from P6 rats as described previously (17Lindholm D. Dechant G. Heisenberg C.P. Thoenen H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Cerebella were dissected and then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 mm glucose, 10 mg/ml DNase, and 0.5 mg/ml papain. Cells were carefully dissociated by triturating through a plastic pipette, pelleted at 900 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was changed after 24 h to serum-free medium with or without BDNF (25 ng/ml) for the cell survival assay. Cerebellar granule cell lysate used for Western blotting was collected after 3-4 days in vitro. Biotinylation Assay—Following treatments, cultures were quickly rinsed in ice-cold PBS-Ca-Mg (PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2). Cell surface proteins were biotinylated for 60 min with sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin; 0.25 mg/ml; Pierce) diluted in PBS-Ca-Mg. Biotinylation was stopped by removing the biotin solution and washing cultures with 10 mm ice-cold glycine in PBS-Ca-Mg for 20 min. Cells were then lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and biotinylated proteins were precipitated with ImmunoPure Immobilized Streptavidin (25 μl; Pierce) by constant mixing overnight at 4 °C. Biotinylated protein precipitates were washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer and processed for Western blotting analysis. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—ELISAs were performed in 96-well plates. Following treatment, cultures were fixed and incubated with anti-TrkB (N-20; 1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 3 h at 37 °C. Cultures were then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1,000; Pierce). For end point assays, the level of surface TrkB was measured by a ready-to-use peroxidase substrate containing 2,3′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid; Sigma). Absorbance was read at 405 nm. Transfection of Primary Cultured Neurons—Hippocampal neurons grown on glass coverslips (Corning) for 7 days were transfected with the full-length TrkB-GFP, truncated TrkB-GFP constructs (kindly provided by Dr. Rosalind A Segal), wild-type dynamin, and dominant negative dynamin constructs (kindly provided by Dr. Bai Lu). Constructs were mixed with 250 mm CaCl2 and an equal volume of 2× Hepes-buffered saline (274 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.4 mm Na2HPO4, 15 mm d-glucose, and 42 mm Hepes, pH 7.06). The DNA-calcium complex was incubated for 20 min and added to cultures for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without glutamine. After transfection, hippocampal neurons were washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transferred to the original medium. We used the Amaxa Nucleofector device (Amaxa Biosystems) to transfect cerebellar granule neurons for the neuronal survival assay and to transfect primary hippocampal neurons for MAP2 staining. Transfection of primary neurons with GFP, Bcl2-GFP, HA-tagged wild type, and constitutively active Akt constructs (kindly provided by Dr. Alfonso Bellacosa (18Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar)) was carried out immediately after dissociation. Plasmids (5 μg of each) were introduced into dissociated neurons by electroporation using the Amaxa Nucleofector before plating onto 35-mm dishes according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfection efficiencies were determined in each experiment by GFP fluorescence, and only cultures with more than 75% of cells transfected were considered for analysis. We also examined transfection efficiency by Western blotting with anti-HA tag or anti-GFP antibodies. Single Cell Fluorescence Imaging—Forty-eight hours after calcium phosphate transfection of full-length or truncated TrkB-GFP constructs, hippocampal neurons were mounted onto a heated stage (37 °C) on the confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510) and incubated in 25 ng/ml BDNF for 5-30 min. GFP fluorescence was visualized under 488-nm wavelength light. Z-series stacks of confocal fluorescence images were acquired with consecutive optic slices (1-μm interval) and reconstructed with the LSM Image Browser. At least eight neurons were captured per condition in each experiment. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was assessed using Student's t test. AP2 RNAi Lentivirus Generation—AP2-targetting oligonucleotides were designed and generated from full-length rat AP2 by Shanghai GeneChem Co., Ltd. After testing knockdown efficiencies, stem-loop DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Shanghai GeneChem Co. Ltd. (sense, 5′-TAA GAA AGT CCA GCA TTC AAA TTT CAA GAG AAT TTG AAT GCT GGA CTT TCT TTT TTT TC-3′; antisense, 5′-TCG AGA AAA AAA AGA AAG TCC AGC ATT CAA ATT CTC TTG AAA TTT GAA TGC TGG ACT TTC TTA-3′) and cloned into the lentivirus-based RNAi vector PsicoR (Addgene). A nontargeting stem-loop DNA PsicoR vector was also generated for use as a negative control. Lentiviral particles were prepared as described previously (19Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). Neurons were infected with AP2-RNAi-lentivirus or negative control virus at 7 days in vitro and examined at 10 days in vitro. Western Blotting and Antibodies—Cultured neurons were lysed in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 μm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1% protease inhibitor mixture set I (Calbiochem) after treatments. Whole cell lysates or biotinylated fractions were mixed with sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-phospho-TrkA (Tyr490) (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-TrkB (H-181) (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-phospho-Akt1/2/3 (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-Akt1/2/3 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (1:2,000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (1:2,000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-PLCγ1 T783 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-PLCγ1(1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-CREB (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-CREB (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-GFP (1:1,000; Santa Cruz), mouse anti-HA tag (1:2000; Sigma), and mouse anti-actin (1:2000; Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:10,000; Pierce) were used. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Pierce). Densitometric analysis was conducted using ImageQuant 5.2 software (Amersham Biosciences), and statistical evaluations were assessed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Student's t test (p < 0.05 was considered significant). Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Reverse Transcription-PCRs—The TRIZOL reagent kit (Invitrogen) was used to isolate mRNA from cultured neurons. First-strand synthesis and PCR were performed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and tag polymerase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primer sets used were as follows: ARC, 5′-CCG CCG GCT CTG AAT CC-3′ and 5′-AAG TTG TTC TCC AGC TTG CCC-3′; NPY, 5′-TGT GGA CTG ACC CTC GCT CTA-3′ and 5′-ATT GGG TGG GAC AGG CAG AC-3′; AP2, 5′-CGG TGG GTT ACT GGT GGA-3′ and 5′-AAC TGC GTG GAG GTC TTG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′ and 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′. Cell Survival Assay—Cell death was detected by enzymatic labeling of DNA strand breaks using the ApopTag peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit (Chemicon) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, neurons were grown on coverslips for 24-well chambers. After treatment, medium was removed, and neurons were washed three times with PBS. Cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and washed three times in PBS. Neurons were permeabilized in ethanol/acetic acid (2:1), washed in PBS, and then incubated with TUNEL solution (TdT and digoxigenin-dUTP) in humidified atmosphere at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction was terminated by rinsing with PBS prior to incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (1:2000) for 60 min. To visualize the immunocomplexed peroxidase, substrate solution (75 μl) was added. The experiment was repeated three times in duplicate. TUNEL labeling was quantified by counting the number of positively stained neurons per 100 cells for each treatment group. Values are represented as the mean percentage of positively stained cells ± S.E. The survival of cerebellar granule neurons was also estimated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay (20Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46516) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical Staining and Fluorescence Microscopy—Hippocampal neurons grown on glass coverslips (Corning Glass) for 7 days were transfected with GFP, HA-tagged wild type dynamin, and dominant negative dynamin constructs by the calcium phosphate method. Forty-eight hours later, transfected neurons were stimulated with BDNF (25 ng/ml for 10 min), fixed, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-phospho-Akt1/2/3 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit anti-phospho-ERK (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology) and mouse anti-HA (1:1000; Sigma) in PBS containing 0.2% goat serum. Cultures were washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor 546- and 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) diluted in PBS containing 0.2% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Images were acquired under a Zeiss confocal microscope (magnification ×40; 488- and 546-nm laser). For the dendritic growth assay, transfection of hippocampal neurons was carried out immediately after dissociation using the Amaxa Nucleofector device. Anti-MAP2 (1:1000; Chemicon) and anti-HA (1:1000; Sigma) were used in the following immunocytochemical procedures. The number of the primary dendrites per neuron was counted from confocal images, and the total dendrite length was determined by tracing all dendritic processes in Neurolucida software. At least 25 neurons were quantified per condition in each experiment, and each experiment was repeated for at least three times. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was assessed using a paired Student's t test. BDNF Induces TrkB Endocytosis in a Clathrin- and Dynamin-dependent Manner—We began our investigation of BDNF-TrkB endocytosis by performing a surface biotinylation assay to measure surface expression of TrkB in cultured cortical neurons when exposed to BDNF. Cells were stimulated with 25 ng/ml BDNF for 0-60 min and then incubated with biotin for 60 min. Biotin-conjugated surface proteins were fractionated on an immobilized streptavidin column, and the amount of surface-TrkB was measured by blotting the biotin fraction with anti-TrkB and comparing it with total TrkB in whole cell lysate (Fig. 1A). Within 15 min of BDNF exposure, a reduction in surface-expressed TrkB was apparent, and the biotinylated fraction was reduced by about 39% (Fig. 1B, top). After 60 min of exposure, only 38% remained at the surface (Fig. 1B, top), but no change in total TrkB expression was observed (Fig. 1A). We further confirmed this finding by ELISA with an antibody specific for the extracellular domain of TrkB. Approximately 33% of cell surface TrkB was internalized by 15 min after BDNF application, and only 45% remained at the surface after 60 min (Fig. 1B, bottom). These results are reminiscent of NGF-induced TrkA endocytosis in PC12 cells (6Grimes M.L. Zhou J. Beattie E.C. Yuen E.C. Hall D.E. Valletta J.S. Topp K.S. LaVail J.H. Bunnett N.W. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7950-7964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suggest that TrkB receptors are endocytosed in response to exogenous BDNF stimulation. To visualize TrkB receptor relocalization, we expressed a GFP-tagged, full-length TrkB fusion protein in cultured hippocampal neurons and monitored the response to BDNF stimulation by time lapse imaging. TrkB-GFP was observed to undergo endocytosis within 5 min of exposure to 25 ng/ml BDNF (data not shown). Movement from the cell surface into intracellular compartments accelerated in the following minutes, and 10 min after application of BDNF, cell surface-localized GFP signals (within 2 μm of the plasma membrane) had decreased by 42%, whereas fluorescence had increased by 51% in the medulla (Fig. 1, C (a and c) and D (top)). In contrast, we did not observe GFP internalization into hippocampal neurons transfected with a GFP-tagged, truncated TrkB receptor lacking the cytoplasmic domain (T-TrkB) in response to BDNF exposure (Fig. 1, C (b and d) and D (bottom)), even after 30 min (data not shown). NGF-induced endocytosis of TrkA is both clathrin- and dynamin-dependent in PC12 cells, and BDNF can rapidly increase AP2 and clathrin translocalization to the plasma membrane (13Beattie E.C. Howe C.L. Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7325-7333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether inhibiting the assembly of the clathrin coat of endosomes with the putative inhibitor MDC (21Schutze S. Machleidt T. Adam D. Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Kruse M.L. Heinrich M. Wickel M. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10203-10212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) could block TrkB internalization. We found that bath application of 50 μm MDC to cortical neuron cultures for 30 min prior to BDNF stimulation completely blocked TrkB endocytosis (Fig. 1, E and F). Pretreatment with Dyn-pep (50 μm) (22Nong Y. Huang Y.Q. Ju W. Kalia L.V. Ahmadian G. Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 2003; 422: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) for 30 min also blocked BDNF-induced TrkB endocytosis (Fig. 1, E and F). BDNF-induced PI3K/Akt Activation Requires Clathrin-, Dynamin-, and AP2-mediated Endocytosis—We next examined whether endocytosis of TrkB is required for downstream signaling. Interestingly, pretreating primary cortical neuron cultures with MDC prevented a sustained BDNF-induced Akt activation (Fig. 2, A and B, top), as did Dyn-pep (Fig. S1), without significantly affecting the activation of TrkB, SHC, ERK, PLCγ, or cAMP-response element-binding protein (Fig. 2, A and B, bottom). Neither MDC nor Dyn-pep affected basal phosphorylation levels of any of these proteins (data not shown). In primary hippocampal neuron cultures and cerebellar granule cells, we similarly found that inhibition of endocytosis by bath application of either MDC or Dyn-pep selectively prevented BDNF-induced Akt activation, without affecting the activation of TrkB and ERK (Fig. 3, B and C) (data not shown). As expected, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a (23Kahle P. Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Hertel C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) completely blocked BDNF-induced activation of TrkB, Akt, and ERK.FIGURE 3BDNF-induced activation of Akt signaling requires clathrin, dynamin, and AP2. A, Western blot showing the expression of AP2 protein in cultured hippocampal neurons infected with nontarget control RNAi (NC-RNAi) and AP2-RNAi lentivirus. Actin was used as a loading control in this and other figures. Histograms represent the average level of AP2 mRNA in uninfected control neurons and neurons infected with nontarget control RNAi or AP2-RNAi 4-5 days prior to RNA harvesting and reverse transcription-PCR (n = 3/group; *, p < 0.05). Values were normalized to GAPDH mRNA, and percentages shown are relative to the level of AP2 mRNA in uninfected neurons. B (left), representative immunoblots of hippocampal neurons treated with K252a (200 nm), MDC (50 μm), Dyn-pep (50 μm), or control solution for 30 min prior to a 10-min stimulation with 25 ng/ml BDNF. Right, representative immunoblots of hippocampal neurons infected with NC-RNAi or AP2-RNAi prior to 10-min stimulation with 25 ng/ml BDNF.

However, staining intensity of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) was not increased in response to BDNF in cells transfected with a construct expressing HA-tagged, dominant negative dynamin (K44E-dynamin; Fig. S2, A and B), which is known to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis (24Je H.S. Zhou J. Yang F. Lu B. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11719-11729Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, staining of phosphorylated ERK (pERK) was not affected by K44E-dynamin expression (Fig. S2, A and B). Transfecting with wild-type dynamin did not alter the levels of pAkt or pERK after BDNF application (Fig. S2, A and B). To further confirm our results, we used a lentivirus-based RNAi delivery system to infect cultured hippocampal neurons with short interfering RNAs targeting clathrin AP2, a critical regulator of endocytosis. AP2 short interfering RNA markedly reduced the expression of AP2 protein and mRNA compared with nontarget control RNAi (Fig. 3A) and blocked BDNF-induced activation of Akt but not ERK (Fig. 3, B and D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that BDNF-induced PI3K/Akt activation in the central nervous system requires clathrin-dependent endocytosis of TrkB. Given the divergent effects of endocytosis on the activation of ERK and Akt pathway"
https://openalex.org/W2117546020,"FAT/CD36 is a membrane scavenger receptor that facilitates long chain fatty acid uptake by muscle. Acute increases in membrane CD36 and fatty acid uptake have been reported in response to insulin and contraction. In this study we have explored protein ubiquitination as one potential mechanism for the regulation of CD36 level. CD36 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or HEK 293 cells was found to be polyubiquitinated via a process involving both lysines 48 and 63 of ubiquitin. Using CHO cells expressing the insulin receptor (CHO/hIR) and CD36, it is shown that addition of insulin (100 nm, 10 and 30 min) significantly reduced CD36 ubiquitination. In contrast, ubiquitination was strongly enhanced by fatty acids (200 microm palmitate or oleate, 2 h). Similarly, endogenous CD36 in C2C12 myotubes was ubiquitinated, and this was enhanced by oleic acid treatment, which also reduced total CD36 protein in cell lysates. Insulin reduced CD36 ubiquitination, increased CD36 protein, and inhibited the opposite effects of fatty acids on both parameters. These changes were paralleled by changes in fatty acid uptake, which could be blocked by the CD36 inhibitor sulfosuccinimidyl oleate. Mutation of the two lysine residues in the carboxyl-terminal tail of CD36 markedly attenuated ubiquitination of the protein expressed in CHO cells and was associated with increased CD36 level and enhanced oleate uptake and incorporation into triglycerides. In conclusion, fatty acids and insulin induce opposite alterations in CD36 ubiquitination, modulating CD36 level and fatty acid uptake. Altered CD36 turnover may contribute to abnormal fatty acid uptake in the insulin-resistant muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2044145296,"Spontaneous, rhythmic subsarcolemmal local Ca2+ releases driven by cAMP-mediated, protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation are crucial for normal pacemaker function of sinoatrial nodal cells (SANC). Because local Ca2+ releases occur beneath the cell surface membrane, near to where adenylyl cyclases (ACs) reside, we hypothesized that the dual Ca2+ and cAMP/PKA regulatory components of automaticity are coupled via Ca2+ activation of AC activity within membrane microdomains. Here we show by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR that SANC express Ca2+-activated AC isoforms 1 and 8, in addition to AC type 2, 5, and 6 transcripts. Immunolabeling of cell fractions, isolated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, confirmed that ACs localize to membrane lipid microdomains. AC activity within these lipid microdomains is activated by Ca2+ over the entire physiological Ca2+ range. In intact SANC, the high basal AC activity produces a high level of cAMP that is further elevated by phosphodiesterase inhibition. cAMP and cAMP-mediated PKA-dependent activation of ion channels and Ca2+ cycling proteins drive sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ releases, which, in turn, activate ACs. This feed forward “fail safe” system, kept in check by a high basal phosphodiesterase activity, is central to the generation of normal rhythmic, spontaneous action potentials by pacemaker cells.

The high basal cAMP in SANC mediates robust basal protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of specific surface membrane ion channels and Ca2+ cycling proteins, which regulates the periodicity and amplitude of spontaneous, sarcoplasmic reticulum generated, local Ca2+ releases in the absence of cell Ca2+ overload (2Vinogradova T.M.

Thus, cAMP-mediated, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of surface membrane ion channels and SR Ca2+ cycling proteins control the SANC basal spontaneous rhythmic firing (2Vinogradova T.M. Lyashkov A.E. Zhu W. Ruknudin A.M. Sirenko S. Yang D. Deo S. Barlow M. Johnson S. Caffrey J.L. Zhou Y.Y. Xiao R.P. Cheng H. Stern M.D. Maltsev V.A. Lakatta E.G. Circ.

The failure of β1 or β2 adrenergic receptor (β-AR) inverse agonists to alter the spontaneous, basal SANC firing rate indicates that high levels of cAMP are not due to constitutively active β-ARs (2Vinogradova T.M. Lyashkov A.E. Zhu W. Ruknudin A.M. Sirenko S. Yang D. Deo S. Barlow M. Johnson S. Caffrey J.L. Zhou Y.Y. Xiao R.P. Cheng H. Stern M.D. Maltsev V.A. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Although a reduction in phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity could, in part, account for elevated cAMP levels in SANC, recent evidence suggests that basal PDE activity of SANC is not reduced, but rather, appears to be elevated (10Vinogradova T.M.

Riordon D.R. Tarasov K.V. Boheler K.R. Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York2006Google Scholar). As only full-length mRNA sequences for rabbit AC2, AC5 and soluble adenylate cyclase are available from GenBank™, primers were designed based on the most conserved motifs from human, rat, and mouse mRNA sequences for each AC. To find conserved motifs, mRNA sequences from human, rat, and mouse ACs were aligned using a program that allows local multiple alignment from Genomatix (“DiAlign”). Numerous primers were chosen and the most conserved motifs of each AC identified using the Primer3 software (13Tarasova Y.S. Riordon D.R. Tarasov K.V. Boheler K.R. Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York2006Google Scholar). Each primer pair was tested using human, rat, mouse, and rabbit heart samples. Nine unique primer sets, corresponding to an individual AC (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, soluble adenylate cyclase) (supplemental materials Table S1), yielded amplification products of appropriate sizes, except AC4, which was not analyzed further. To verify that the amplification products corresponded to appropriate ACs, fragments from rabbit intact sinoatrial node (SAN) tissue were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced on ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems) using SP6 and T7 promoter primers. Each sequence was analyzed using BLAST to verify its homology to the appropriate adenylate cyclase mRNA from human, rat, and mouse. q-RT-PCR analyses were performed on AC using pre-tested primer sets. Each group tested consisted of four samples corresponding to RNA isolated from brain, SANs (n = 3) and SANC (n = 3) of individual rabbits. For q-RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA, previously treated with DNase I (Ambion Inc.), was reversed transcribed with random hexonucleotides (PE applied Biosystems). q-RT-PCR were run with an ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detector System (PE Applied Biosystems) in the presence of SYBR Green using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture (12 μl) contained 1 μl of cDNA, 6 μl of Platinum SYBR Green qPCR Super Mix-UDG, 0.2 μl of ROX reference dye, 1 μl of 10 μmol of forward and 1 μl of 10 μmol of reverse primers, and 12 μl of DNase/RNase-free water (Invitrogen). Cycling conditions were: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min; 45 amplification cycles were at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Each assay was performed in quadruplicate, and three negative controls were run for every assay: no template (sample lacking cDNA), no reverse transcriptase, and no RNA in reverse transcriptase reaction. Standard curves from cDNA dilutions of target genes and 10-fold dilutions of endogenous references (18S rRNA (18S)) were performed. The threshold cycle (Ct) of each sample was transformed to the log of the dilutions and normalized. Normalized data are presented as (1/ΔCt), where ΔCt = (Ct - Ct18S) value (13Tarasova Y.S. Riordon D.R. Tarasov K.V. Boheler K.R. Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York2006Google Scholar). Sucrose Density Gradient Fractionation of SAN Tissue and Isolated SANC—Membrane microdomain extraction and subsequent equilibrium centrifugation were performed as previously described, with only slight modifications (14Ilangumaran S. Arni S. Chicheportiche Y. Briol A. Hoessli D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 mg of protein from isolated SANC was subjected to disruption in a homogenizer in 500 μl total volume of TKM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) + 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml of each aprotinin, antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, and trypsin inhibitor (Roche)), and extracted on ice for 30 min. The material was transferred to a SW41 centrifuge tube and mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in TKM (v/v). Extracts were then gently overlaid with 6 ml of 38% sucrose/TKM, followed by 4 ml of 5% sucrose/TKM for a total volume of 11 ml. Tubes were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C in a SW41 rotor (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Eleven 1-ml fractions were collected carefully from the top of the tube and used immediately for AC activity studies or stored at -20 °C until subsequent use. All protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). cAMP Assay—Suspensions of intact isolated cells from a given heart were divided into control and treatment groups, consisting of 0.1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine or 1 μm isoproterenol. Aliquots of cells were incubated with gentle shaking during 5 min at 34 °C. To buffer intracellular Ca2+, the same experiments were repeated with isolated cells pretreated with BAPTA-AM (25 μm) for 30 min at 34 °C. To determine cyclic AMP levels in the isolated ventricular myocytes and SANC submitted to the different treatments, ice-cold ethanol was added to the cell suspension to have a final suspension volume of 65% ethanol. After vigorous mixing, the extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min and 4 °C. The supernatants were collected; the remaining precipitates were washed again with ice-cold 65% ethanol and centrifuged as before. Collected supernatants were SpeedVac dried and stored at -20 °C or used immediately for cAMP measurements. cAMP was measured by radioimmunoassay (the cAMP [125I] Biotrak assay system from Amersham Biosciences (RPA 509)) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, prior to analysis, dried extracts and standard cAMP samples were dissolved in 0.5 ml of the standard “assay buffer.” The solutions were mixed with a reconstituted antiserum from a lyophilized rabbit anti-succinyl cAMP and incubated 1 h at 4 °C. The tracer, adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic phosphoric acid 2′-o-succinyl-3-[125I]iodotyrosine methyl ester, was added to every tube, and the tubes incubated for 3 more hours at 4 °C. The secondary antibody obtained from donkey anti-rabbit serum coated onto magnetizable polymer particles was added. The mixtures were left at room temperature for 10 min, centrifuged at 2,600 × g and 4 °C in a Sorvall RT 6000D for 15 min. Supernatants were discarded and the tubes were inverted on absorbent pads for 5 min. The pellets were counted in a γ counter. Adenylyl Cyclase Assay—To determine adenylyl cyclase catalytic activity of whole cells, cell suspension containing 20–50 μg of protein was precipitated and resuspended in 350 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340). This suspension was sonicated on ice 3 times for 30 s separated by 1 min; the sonicator setting was 3. Forty μl of this homogenate was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 350 μl of an ATP regenerating system comprised of: 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.8 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 70 units of CPK, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm isobutylmethylxanthine. A final [Ca2+] of 0.2 or 1 μm at pH 7.4 and 30 °C was achieved by adding to the assay buffer 0.7336 or 0.9332 mm CaCl2, respectively (15Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation the medium was extracted to determine the cAMP as described above. A similar procedure was employed to determine AC activity in sucrose gradient-separated cell and tissue fractions. In this case, samples were 20 μl and contained ∼0.8–9 μg of protein. Immunoblots of Fractionated SAN Tissue and SANC Extracts— Dot immunoassays were performed as described previously (14Ilangumaran S. Arni S. Chicheportiche Y. Briol A. Hoessli D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), with minor modifications as outlined below. Briefly, 100-μl portions of each fraction were serially diluted and added to wells of a Bio-Dot apparatus (Bio-Rad), and incubated on nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, 0.45 μm) for 1 h at room temperature. Gentle pressure was applied to the membrane and samples were gently suctioned, then the membrane was washed 2 times with TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), and allowed to air dry. These membranes were then removed from the apparatus and blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Membrane strips were incubated with primary antibodies in TBST, 0.5% milk powder overnight at 4 °C and washed three times for 10 min with TBST prior to incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) for 45 min. The strips were then washed three times for 15 min and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) assay (Amersham Biosciences) before exposure to Hyper-Film ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The following antibodies were used in dot immunoassays: AC1 and AC2 (rabbit, polyclonal), from FabGennix, Frisco, TX; AC8 (goat, polyclonal) and AC5/6 and AC-pan (rabbit, polyclonal), from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; and caveolin-3 (mouse, monoclonal), from Research Diagnostic, Concord, MA. GM1 was detected by non-denatured cholera toxin, B-subunit, from Calbiochem. Densitometry was performed as previously described for Western blotting. Briefly, for blots measured on the Typhoon 9410 (GE Healthcare), ImageQuant 5.0 (GE Healthcare) was used to circle dots and measure the intensity. For measures using film (Hyperfilm, ECL, GE Healthcare), spots were measured using the freeware ScionImage (Frederick, MD). Raw intensity values were used to calculate percentage of signal intensity. Patch Clamp Experiments on Single Isolated Rabbit SANC— A perforated patch clamp technique as described previously (16Vinogradova T.M. Zhou Y.Y. Bogdanov K.Y. Yang D. Kuschel M. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) with 50 μm β-escin (Sigma) added to the pipette solution was used to measure cell capacitance and record spontaneous APs with an Axopatch-2B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Briefly, 35–45 μl of isolated viable rabbit SANC stored at 4 °C in KB solution were placed into the experimental chamber (total volume of 300 μl) and perfused (1.5 ml/min at 35 °C) with regular Tyrode buffer (composition (in mm): NaCl, 140; KCl, 5.4; MgCl2, 1; HEPES, 5; CaCl2, 1.8; glucose, 5.5; pH 7.4). The most viable regular rhythmically beating cells were utilized in the experiments. Standard electrodes with the tip resistances ranging from 3 to 4.5 mΩ filled with the standard solution containing (in mm): potassium gluconate, 120; NaCl, 10; MgATP, 5; HEPES, 5; KCl, 20 (pH 7.2), were used to obtain gigaseal and record action potentials. A subset of cells was voltage clamped to measure the hyperpolarization-activated current, If, in the presence and absence of CsCl (2 mm). Pharmacological experiments employed the common AC inhibitor MDL-12,330A hydrochloride (Sigma) dissolved in water with final concentrations of 40 and 400 μm; or a specific cell permeable peptide inhibitor of the protein kinase A, PKI (Calbiochem) dissolved in water with the final concentration 15 μm; or the fast, cell-permeable Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (Molecular Probes) dissolved in the appropriate amount of DMSO with final concentrations of 5 and 25 μm; or continuous superfusion of the cell with 2 mm CsCl to block the If current in spontaneously beating SANC. AC mRNA Isoform Expression in SANC—AC isoforms differ in their regulation and Ca2+ sensitivity (17Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), with AC types 1 and 8 being specifically activated by Ca2+. q-RT-PCR was used to determine expression levels of AC isoform RNAs in SAN tissue as well as isolated SANC. Data were compared with brain tissue in which high levels of Ca2+-activated AC types have been reported (17Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). We observed that numerous AC isoform transcripts are expressed in SAN, in isolated SANC, and in the brain, and that relative transcript abundance for the various AC types differed widely among the three groups (supplemental materials Fig. S1). Fig. 1A shows representative q-RT-PCR amplifications of the AC1 isoform transcripts. Note the relatively high abundance of AC1 in brain (threshold cycle, Ct = 26) and less abundant, but definite, expression in SAN (Ct = 30) and SANC (Ct = 33). The average expression of all AC isoforms measured is illustrated in supplemental materials Fig. S1. The correct molecular weight for each transcript was observed yet each varied in abundance depending on tissue/cell type (Fig. 1, B and C). For example, AC type 5 is the dominant mRNA transcript in SAN tissue, exceeding the level in brain by 4-fold (Fig. 1C). The relative abundance of AC type 5 in isolated SANC is markedly less than that in SAN tissue (Fig. 1C). The relative abundance of AC types 1, 2, and 8 mRNA transcripts in SAN tissue is substantially lower than in brain (Fig. 1C), ranging from less than 1 to 8% of brain isoforms. (Note the difference in calibration of y axis in the left and right panels of Fig. 1C.) The relative mRNA abundance of types 1, 2, and 8 differ between intact SAN tissue and isolated SANC: in isolated SANC, the transcript abundance of AC type 1 is substantially less than that in SAN (by <10-fold), whereas AC type 8 transcript content is greater in SANC than in SAN. Localization of Different AC Isoforms in Membrane Lipid Domains—The volume fraction of the caveolae of SANC exceeds, by 2-fold, that in other cardiac cell types (18Masson-Pevet M. Bleeker W.K. Gros D. Circ. Res. 1979; 45: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Caveolae increase the surface area of rabbit SANC external sarcolemma by 100%, whereas in rabbit papillary muscle caveolae increase the surface membrane area by only 17–27% (18Masson-Pevet M. Bleeker W.K. Gros D. Circ. Res. 1979; 45: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Numerous signaling pathways reside within caveolae. Because of the plasma membrane localization of ACs, the AC activity likely varies locally among membrane microdomains. Because the amino acid sequence of catalytic domains of AC families is largely conserved, the broad range of individual regulation must be associated with the sequence diversity outside these domains (19Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), which may affect their binding to other molecules. Density gradient fractionation of SANC was performed and individual fractions were immunoblotted to determine relative distribution of caveolin, GM1, another lipid raft microdomain marker, and AC isoform immunolabeling. Fig. 2A illustrates a representative gel of 1/20 of a pooled sample of fractionated SANC isolated from five SANs. Independent fractions are labeled in each lane (fractions 1–11). Note that the buoyancy decreases as the fraction numbers increase, and that fractions 10 and 11 are the most soluble fractions. Fig. 2B, top panel, illustrates the raw signal intensity of dot immunoblots for caveolin-3 and ganglioside M1 (GM1), a lipid raft marker depicted as a representative experiment, and the lower panel illustrates the average immunolabeling of three combined fractions 1–3, 4–7, and 8–9 depicted as fractions I–III, respectively, in the top panel. Note, on average 60% of caveolin and GM1 immunolabeling are located in combined fraction II. Combined fractions I and III each contain a substantially reduced, but finite immunolabeling for the lipid raft markers. Fig. 2C represents AC PAN and specific AC immunolabeling in a representative experiment in isolated SANC (top) and averaged data (lower panel). Although the signal intensity of most AC markers is greatest in pooled fraction II, i.e. the fraction containing the most intensive caveolin and GM1 immunolabeling (Fig. 2, B and C, dashed line, lower panel), immunolabeling of AC-PAN and AC8 across the fractions appears broader than AC 1, 2, and 5/6 antibody labeling. In new experiments, SAN tissue, which provides a greater protein yield than isolated SANC, was fractionated and serially diluted to probe for caveolin, GM1, and AC isoforms. Supplemental materials Fig. S2 illustrates the serially diluted immunoblots for each antibody, and supplemental Table S2 lists the relative percent signal intensity for each sample dilution in each fraction for each antibody. Note the same relative distribution of immunolabeling across the fractions for such antibody, regardless of the dilution. Correlations between caveolin and AC immunolabeling across the fractions were high (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the ACs reside within lipid membrane microdomains of SANC. Differences in the slope of this relation between AC-PAN, AC8, and the other AC isoforms (Fig. 2D) reflect the broader immunostaining pattern of AC-PAN and AC8 (panel D). AC Activity and cAMP—In isolated SANC pooled from an additional 5 hearts, total AC activity and its Ca2+ dependence, in addition to immunolabeling for Ca2+-activated ACs in each fraction depicted in Fig. 2, B and C, was measured. Fig. 3A indicates a marked Ca2+ dependence of basal AC activity over the physiologic intracellular Ca2+ range (0.2–1 μm). Note that most of the Ca2+ activation of AC activity lies within combined fractions II and III. Note also that in the absence of Ca2+ AC activity drops to nearly undetectable levels. Fig. 3B illustrates the average relative distributions of Ca2+-activated AC activity and Ca2+-activated AC isoform immunolabeling. On average, 80% of AC activity was detected in fractions II and III with 20% in fraction I. The relative distribution of AC activity among the three fractions generally parallels that of Ca2+-activated AC isoform immunolabeling. The different profiles of AC1 and AC8 immunolabeling is noteworthy: AC type 1 immunolabeling tracks that of caveolin (Fig. 2C, dashed line) with 60% of it being localized within fraction II; AC type 8 immunolabeling has a broader distribution across the fractions with 40% being present in fraction II and 30% found in each of the other type of fractions, i.e. more similar to the distribution of Ca2+-activated AC activity. Fig. 3C provides direct evidence, in whole cell lysates of intact SANC, of Ca2+-stimulated AC activity in the absence of sucrose density cell fractioning. Following incubation of whole cell lysates in Ca2+-free buffer containing EGTA, AC activity was greatly increased by incubation in the presence of Ca2+ at concentrations that occur within the physiologic range in intact cells. In intact, isolated SANC, Ca2+ buffering, PDE inhibition, or β-AR stimulation markedly affect the cAMP level (Fig. 3D). PDE inhibition increases the basal cAMP level by 9-fold, exposing a high level of AC activity (Fig. 3D, left panel). This cAMP increase in the presence of PDE inhibition is reduced by 30% by chelation of intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA. Fig. 3D, left panel, shows that β-AR stimulation with isoproterenol (ISO) increases the cAMP level, but to a markedly lesser extent than PDE inhibition. Furthermore, the ISO-induced increase in cAMP is not reduced by Ca2+ buffering. The combination of ISO and PDE inhibition (Fig. 3D, right panel), however, increases cAMP to a level that substantially exceeds (by 7-fold) that induced by ISO alone (note difference in ordinate scale in left and right panels). This suggests that PDE activity, in addition to regulating the basal cAMP, also moderates the increasing cAMP level regulated by ACs that are activated by β-ARs. Still, unlike PDE inhibition alone, the combined ISO plus PDE-induced increase in cAMP is not reduced by intracellular Ca2+ buffering. Effects of Inhibition of Adenylyl Cyclase, PKA, or Ca2+ Buffering on Spontaneous AP Firing in Isolated SANC—Numerous interacting subcellular mechanisms link Ca2+ activation AC activity, cAMP, cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of ion channels, and Ca2+ itself to pacemaker cell function. Fig. 4A illustrates a schematic of the potential interplay between Ca2+, AC, cAMP-PKA signaling, SR Ca2+ cycling proteins, and ion sarcolemmal ion channels. We employed pharmacological measurements in an attempt to partially sort the functional implications of some of these interactions. The dependence of spontaneous AP generation on intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 4A) is clearly demonstrated by the ability of intracellular Ca2+ chelating by BAPTA-AM to abrogate spontaneous AP firing (Fig. 4B). This effect of Ca2+ buffering could occur via a reduced Ca2+ activation of AC (Fig. 3, C and D, left panel), leading to a local [cAM"
https://openalex.org/W2052553464,"In response to transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ) stimulation, fibroblasts modify their integrin repertoire and adhesive capabilities to certain extracellular matrix proteins. Although TGFβ has been shown to increase the expression of specific αv integrins, the mechanisms underlying this are unknown. In this study we demonstrate that TGFβ1 increased both β3 integrin subunit mRNA and protein levels as well as surface expression of αvβ3 in human lung fibroblasts. TGFβ1-induced αvβ3 expression was strongly adhesion-dependent and associated with increased focal adhesion kinase and c-Src kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of β3 integrin activation by the Arg-Gly-Asp tripeptide motif-specific disintegrin echistatin or αvβ3 blocking antibody prevented the increase in β3 but not β5 integrin expression. In addition, echistatin inhibited TGFβ1-induced p38 MAPK but not Smad3 activation. Furthermore, inhibition of the Src family kinases, but not focal adhesion kinase, completely abrogated TGFβ1-induced expression of αvβ3 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation but not β5 integrin expression and Smad3 activation. The TGFβ1-induced αvβ3 expression was blocked by pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of p38 MAPK- but not Smad2/3-, Sp1-, ERK-, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and NF-κB-dependent pathways. Our results demonstrate that TGFβ1 induces αvβ3 integrin expression via a β3 integrin-, c-Src-, and p38 MAPK-dependent pathway. These data identify a novel mechanism for TGFβ1 signaling in human lung fibroblasts by which they may contribute to normal and pathological wound healing.

These data identify a novel mechanism for TGFβ1 signaling in human lung fibroblasts by which they may contribute to normal and pathological wound healing. One of the key events in wound repair is the infiltration of fibroblasts from surrounding tissue to the extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; TGFβ1, transforming growth factor β1; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FRNK, FAK-related non-kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SFK, Src family kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; RGD, Arg-Gly-Asp tripeptide motif; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; siRNA, short interfering RNA; Ab, antibody; FN, fibronectin; WB, Western blot; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity. in which they proliferate and differentiate into myofibroblasts. Under normal conditions myofibroblasts play a crucial role in ECM deposition and subsequent wound contraction and then disappear as the fibrotic response diminishes and normal structure and function are achieved (1Hinz B.

However, their retention, uncontrolled proliferation, and excessive synthesis of ECM proteins represents a pathologic process that ultimately results in fibrosis (2Paine III, R. Ward P.A. Am. J.

Adhesion of cells to ECM is mediated by a family of transmembrane proteins known as integrins that are expressed on the cell surface as α/β heterodimers (7Hynes R.O.

Importantly, integrins not only support cell attachment but also act in concert with receptors for several growth factors, including TGFβ, to regulate survival, migration, proliferation, and differentiation of fibroblastic, epithelial, and endothelial cells (reviewed in Refs. 7Hynes R.O.

It was also reported that growth factors are able to activate integrins and that this activation provided an additional mechanism for a growth factor to induce a broad spectrum of cellular responses (15Trusolino L.

Recently we demonstrated that TGFβ1 not only synergistically interacts with αvβ3 integrins but also induces their gene transcription in human lung fibroblasts (4Scaffidi A.K. Petrovic N. Moodley Y.P. Fogel-Petrovic M. Kroeger K.M. Seeber R.M. Eidne K.A. Thompson P.J. Knight D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37726-37733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms involved in this process are still unknown. Therefore, this study was undertaken to delineate the signaling mechanisms that mediate αvβ3 up-regulation in response to TGFβ1 stimulation. The results of this study demonstrate that TGFβ1-dependent induction of β3 integrin expression does not involve Smad2/3 or Sp1 transcription factors, but it is mediated by selective and specific activation of the integrin itself and c-Src and p38 MAPK pathways. Plasmids and Pharmacological Inhibitors—The pcDNA3-Smad7 plasmid was provided by Dr. Steven Mutsaers (University of Western Australia), and the pcDNA3-p38-KM (kinase mutant) plasmid was provided by Dr. Kun Liang Guan (University of Michigan). The GFP-FRNK (FAK-related non-kinase)-expressing adenovirus (Adv-GFP-FRNK) and adenovirus expressing GFP alone (Adv-GFP) were kindly provided by Dr. Allen M. Samarel (the Cardiovascular Institute, Loyola University Medical Center). The pharmacological inhibitors SB203580, UO126, the Src inhibitor, PP2, and its inactive isomer PP3 were purchased from Calbiochem, and SB202190, wortmannin, the β3 selective disintegrin echistatin from Echis carinatus, Src inhibitor SU6656, Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin A from Streptomyces plicatus, and the NF-κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—Normal human diploid lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in F-12K Nutrient Mixture medium (F-12K) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and antibiotics before they reached 90% confluence. Prior to the experiments cells were washed extensively in PBS and quiesced in serum-free F-12K for 24 h. Flow Cytometry—HFL-1 cells were cultured to 90% confluence and stimulated with recombinant human TGFβ1 (Pepro-Tech, Rocky Hill, NJ) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Sigma) in serum-free conditions for the indicated time periods. For experiments examining signaling pathways, cells were pretreated with pharmacological inhibitors of specific signaling molecules for 40 min prior to the addition of TGFβ1. Adherent cells were collected after trypsin/EDTA immersion, and surface expression of integrins was allowed to recover for 30 min in PBS with 10% FBS at room temperature. This step also served to block nonspecific antibody binding. Cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice. Cell surface expression of αvβ3 integrin was analyzed using an anti-human αvβ3 integrin antibody (mouse IgG1, clone LM609, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and normal mouse IgG1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as an isotype control, followed by incubation with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2 (Cedarlane Laboratories, Ontario, Canada). Cell-associated fluorescence was acquired by a Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Ontario, Canada) and analyzed using Win-MDI 2.8 software. RNA Extraction and Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR— See on-line supplemental material for details. Transfection—HFL-1 were seeded at 1 × 105 cells per well in 6-well tissue culture plates for 24 h prior to transfection. The cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of mouse Smad7 DNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) for 24 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confirmation of function was determined by Western blot (WB) analysis of α-smooth muscle actin expression in TGFβ1-stimulated cells (see supplemental Fig. 1SA). Human Smad3-specific chimera-RNA interference (Smad3 siRNA) (Abnova Corp, Taipei City, Taiwan) and nonsilencing control siRNA (Qiagen, Ontario, Canada) were transfected into HFL-1 cells by using HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) as instructed by the manufacturer. Forty eight hours after transfection cells were washed with fresh culture medium and further stimulated with TGFβ1 for 24 h. siRNA transfection efficiency was determined by WB (supplemental Fig. 1SB). The mammalian expression plasmids, pcDNA3-p38-KM, pcDNA3 (empty vector control), and pcDNA3-GFP (transfection efficiency control) were transfected into lung fibroblasts using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The optimal ratio of FuGENE 6 (μl) to DNA (μg) was determined to be 6:1 for HFL-1 cells (supplemental Fig. 2SA). Expression of plasmids was monitored by WB for p38 MAPK expression and by fluorescence microscopy for GFP (data not shown). Following transfection, cells were incubated with 10% FBS in media for 24 h and then with 1% FBS for the next 24 h. Medium was changed, and cells were cultured for an additional 18 h in the presence or absence of TGFβ1. Replication-defective adenoviruses encoding GFP-FRNK fusion protein and GFP alone were amplified and purified using HEK-293 cells as described (18Heidkamp M.C. Bayer A.L. Kalina J.A. Eble D.M. Samarel A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1282-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments determined that a concentration of 50–100 particles of Adv-GFP-FRNK and Adv-GFP per cell strongly induced the expression of these proteins (supplemental Fig. 2SB) and infected virtually every fibroblast (∼90% of GFP positive cells by flow cytometry) after 48 h of exposure (data not shown). After infection with Adv-GFP-FRNK and Adv-GFP, cells were cultured in the presence of serum for 24 h, then serum-starved for additional 24 h, and stimulated with TGFβ1 for the indicated time periods. Western Blotting—After TGFβ1 stimulation, control or cell signaling inhibitor-pretreated cell monolayers were lysed in protein extraction buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). Equal concentrations of protein lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with a mixture of primary antibodies. p38 MAPK phosphorylation was determined using mouse mAb against human phosphorylated p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human p38 MAPK (both from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). FAK phosphorylation was determined using mouse mAb against human phosphorylated FAK (pY397) (BD Biosciences) and rabbit polyclonal Ab against C-terminal region of human FAK (pp125FAK, Sigma). c-Src and Smad3 phosphorylation was determined using rabbit mAb against phospho-Src (Tyr-416) (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal Ab against c-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit mAb against phospho-Smad3 (Ser423/425) (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA), respectively, and anti-β-tubulin mAb (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) to control equal protein loading. Expression of β3 integrin chain, β5 integrin chain, and fibronectin was detected with mouse mAb (BD Biosciences) or rabbit polyclonal Ab (Cell Signaling Technology) against human β3 integrin, polyclonal rabbit Ab against human β5 integrin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and cellular fibronectin (Chemicon), respectively. Detection was performed with IR700 and IR800 anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) and the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE) using the manufacturer's protocol. Density of the bands was analyzed with Odyssey software 1.1 (LI-COR Biotechnology) using two infrared channels independently. The results are expressed as a phosphorylated protein/nonphosphorylated protein density ratio or protein/β-tubulin density ratio. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons were performed using ANOVA with post hoc Fisher's protected least significant difference. Probability values were considered significant if they were less than 0.05. All tests were done using StatView 5.0 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). TGFβ1 Increases β3 Protein Expression and Enhances Cell Surface Expression of αvβ3 Integrin on Human Lung Fibroblasts—Recently we showed that TGFβ1 increased β3 steady-state mRNA expression (4Scaffidi A.K. Petrovic N. Moodley Y.P. Fogel-Petrovic M. Kroeger K.M. Seeber R.M. Eidne K.A. Thompson P.J. Knight D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37726-37733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Consistent with the increased β3 transcription, fibroblasts also increased β3 subunit and αvβ3 integrin expression on the cell surface after exposure to TGFβ1 at a concentration of 10 ng/ml and higher. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, β3 protein levels significantly increased after 24 h of exposure to TGFβ1 at a concentration of 10 ng/ml. As shown in Fig. 1B, surface expression of αvβ3 heterodimer was also significantly elevated after cell stimulation with TGFβ1 (60% increase in MFI and 2-fold increase in the percentage of αvβ3-positive cells). Increased integrin expression on the cell surface was observed for up to 48 h, although the magnitude of expression was not significantly different from that seen at 24 h (data not shown). In contrast, EGF treatment did not significantly modify β3 protein production or surface expression of αvβ3 after 24 h of exposure (Fig. 1, A and B). Moreover, when EGF was simultaneously added with TGFβ1, it abrogated both TGFβ1-induced β3 subunit and αvβ3 cell surface expression (Fig. 1, A and B). In parallel we examined the effect of TGFβ1 on another αv partner, the β5 integrin. We found that incubation of HFL-1 with TGFβ1 for 18 h induced robust expression of αvβ5 (supplemental Fig. 3S) by increasing β5 protein production (Fig. 1C) similar to the effects on αvβ3 expression. In addition, both removal of exogenously added TGFβ1 (washing) and neutralizing of endogenously produced TGFβ with a pan-TGFβ blocking antibody (clone 1D11), dramatically attenuated the effect of TGFβ1 on β3 and β5 integrin expression (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that the TGFβ1 effects on αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrin expression are: 1) associated with up-regulation of corresponding β integrin chain expression, and 2) highly specific and not mediated by a secondary mediator. TGFβ1-induced Expression of αvβ3 Integrin by Human Lung Fibroblasts Does Not Require Smad and Sp1—In our previous studies we have shown that both Smad2 and p38 MAPK were activated in human lung fibroblasts within 10 min of TGFβ1 stimulation, and peak activation was reached at 1 h (19Horowitz J.C. Lee D.Y. Waghray M. Keshamouni V.G. Thomas P.E. Zhang H. Cui Z. Thannickal V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1359-1367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In pilot experiments we found that both TGFβ1-induced Smad3 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation was still detectable after 18 h and correlated with the increased levels of β3 and β5 integrins (supplemental Fig. 4S and Fig. 1C). We used two approaches to evaluate the role of Smad signaling in regulating the effect of TGFβ1 on integrin expression. In the first set of experiments, a murine Smad7-expressing construct was used. Although mouse Smad7 is 95% homologous with the human cDNA, experiments investigating the effect of this construct on TGFβ1-induced α-smooth muscle actin expression were performed. TGFβ1-induced increase in α-smooth muscle actin expression in fibroblasts was completely abolished by Smad7 overexpression, confirming that the mouse protein is functional in human fibroblasts (supplemental Fig. 1SA). However, transfection of the Smad7 construct did not significantly influence the effect of TGFβ1 on αvβ3 expression (Fig. 2A). To further prove that TGFβ1 effect on β3 integrin expression is Smad-independent, fibroblasts were transfected with control or Smad3 siRNA, and the level of β3 and β5 integrin expression was determined by immunoblotting. The control experiments showed that total and Ser423/425-phosphorylated Smad3 protein was knocked down by 60% compared with control (supplemental Fig. 1SB). In keeping with the results from Smad7 overexpression, inhibition of Smad3 did not influence the expression of β3 integrin induced by TGFβ1. In contrast, Smad3 siRNA significantly attenuated β5 integrin expression induced by TGFβ1 (Fig. 2B). Cooperation between the Smad proteins and the transcription factor Sp1 may represent a general mechanism for conferring TGFβ1 inducibility of several genes, including integrins (13Lai C.F. Feng X.

Salesse C. Guerin S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39182-39192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether Sp1 was involved in the up-regulation of αvβ3 integrin induced by TGFβ1. As shown in Fig. 2C, the Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin had no effect on β3 subunit, but it efficiently prevented the increase in fibronectin expression induced by TGFβ1. Together these results indicate that the Smad/Sp1 pathway does not play a major role in TGFβ1-induced up-regulation of αvβ3 integrins on human lung fibroblasts. TGFβ1-induced β3 Expression Requires Cell Adhesion and Is Enhanced by Integrin Activation with ECM Proteins—Our previous studies have demonstrated that several TGFβ-mediated effects in human lung fibroblasts are adhesion- and integrin-dependent (3Scaffidi A.K. Moodley Y.P. Weichselbaum M. Thompson P.J. Knight D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3507-3516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Scaffidi A.K. Petrovic N. Moodley Y.P. Fogel-Petrovic M. Kroeger K.M.

In preliminary experiments we found that TGFβ1 was unable to increase αvβ3 integrin expression in cells in suspension but did so in cells adherent on a plastic surface (data not shown). Therefore, we determined whether integrin activation following adhesion to different ECM proteins influences the ability of TGFβ1 to induce αvβ3 expression. Fig. 3 demonstrates that cell adhesion to either fibronectin (FN) or collagen did not significantly modify basal β3 expression; however, FN strongly potentiated the effect of TGFβ1. These findings suggest that signals mediated by integrin activation following cell adhesion are necessary for TGFβ1 to elevate β3 integrin expression. TGFβ1-induced β3 Integrin Expression Is Dependent on αvβ3 Activation—To evaluate the role of integrin activation on enhanced αvβ3 expression, we treated adherent fibroblasts with the disintegrin echistatin, which has been shown to inhibit the activation of RGD-binding integrins in several cell types (17Sekimoto H. Eipper-Mains J. Pond-Tor S. Boney C.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1859-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Della Morte R. Squillacioti C. Garbi C. Derkinderen P.

McLane M.A. Niewiarowski S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1565-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Echistatin had no effect on cell attachment but dose-dependently impaired the ability of fibroblasts to spread and support monolayer integrity (supplemental Fig. 5S). As shown in Fig. 4A, exposure of cells to echistatin abrogated the effect of TGFβ1 on β3, but not on β5 integrin expression. To show that echistatin prevents activation of αvβ3 and downstream integrin-mediated signaling, we determined levels of Tyr397-FAK and Tyr416-Src phosphorylation following exposure to the disintegrin. Echistatin dramatically inhibited TGFβ1-induced c-Src kinase (Fig. 4B) and FAK phosphorylation (data not shown) in a concentration-dependent manner. To demonstrate that echistatin inhibits β3 integrin expression by blocking integrin, but not TGFβ1 signaling, FN expression in response to TGFβ1 exposure was determined. In contrast to β3, FN expression induced by TGFβ1 was enhanced in the presence of echistatin indicating that TGFβ1 up-regulates β3 integrin expression directly by activation of the integrin on the cell surface rather than indirectly through enhanced production of ECM proteins. Echistatin also had no effect on Smad3 activation per se (Fig. 4B), but it inhibited TGFβ1-induced p38 MAPK in parallel with β3 integrin expression (Fig. 4, A and B). Because echistatin may also influence other RGD integrins apart from αvβ3, we next aimed to confirm the identity of the integrin involved in TGFβ1-induced β3 expression. To do this, we incubated fibroblasts with 10 μg/ml monoclonal blocking antibodies to human αvβ3 integrin (clone LM609) and αvβ5 integrin (clone P5H9) 1 h before addition of TGFβ1. Similar to the effect seen with echistatin, LM609, but not P5H9 or control IgG, completely abrogated the effect of TGFβ1 on β3 integrin expression (Fig. 4C). These results provide further support for the concept that the effect of TGFβ1 on β3 subunit expression is dependent on the activation of αvβ3, but not αvβ5 integrin, on the cell surface and recruitment of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, including FAK and c-Src kinase. Adenovirally Mediated Overexpression of FRNK Inhibits TGFβ1-induced FAK Activation but Not αvβ3 Expression—Based on the observation that integrin activation and clustering results in activation of FAK, we determined the effect of TGFβ1 on FAK phosphorylation. Fig. 5A demonstrates that TGFβ1 induced time-dependent phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr397, its major autophosphorylation site. The enhanced Tyr397 phosphorylation of FAK was somewhat delayed, being first observed 3 h following TGFβ1 exposure and further increased at later time points (Fig. 5A, p < 0.05) coincidentally with the induction of β3 expression. To confirm whether FAK activation was involved in TGFβ1-induced αvβ3 expression, fibroblasts were infected by a replication-defective adenovirus encoding a GFP-FRNK fusion protein (Adv-GFP-FRNK) and exposed to TGFβ1. FRNK is the C-terminal noncatalytic domain of FAK and acts as a negative regulator of FAK autophosphorylation (23Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 24Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Ilic D. Klingbeil C.K. Schaefer E. Damsky C.H. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Western Blot for GFP-FRNK revealed abundant expression in Adv-GFP-FRNK-infected cells but not in control Adv-GFP-infected cells, and infection of fibroblasts with Adv-GFP-FRNK completely abrogated spontaneous and TGFβ1-induced Tyr397-FAK phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 2SB). However, TGFβ1 induced cell surface expression of αvβ3 in both Adv-GFP-FRNK- and Adv-GFP-infected cells (Fig. 5, B and C). These data suggest that inhibition of FAK autophosphorylation on Tyr397 does not influence TGFβ1-induced αvβ3 expression. Inhibition of c-Src Kinase Activity Blocks TGFβ1-induced αvβ3 Integrin Expression—To confirm the involvement of c-Src kinase in TGFβ1-induced αvβ3 integrin expression, we exposed cells to the Src kinase inhibitor, PP2, and measured αvβ3 expression following TGFβ1 stimulation. As shown in Fig. 6A, exposure of cells to PP2 completely abrogated the stimulatory effect of TGFβ1 on αvβ3 surface expression. Furthermore, incubation with PP2 suppressed the effects of TGFβ1 on β3 gene expression over a 6-h time period (Fig. 6B). It has been demonstrated that Src kinases regulate signaling-dependent adhesion as well as FAK-mediated signaling events by regulating FAK kinase activity. As expected, PP2, but not the inactive PP3, almost completely inhibited both Tyr416-Src and Tyr397-FAK phosphorylation induced by TGFβ1 (data not shown). TGFβ1-induced β3 protein increase was also strongly inhibited by PP2 but not PP3 (Fig. 6C). Recently, it has been demonstrated that PP2 can also inhibit TGFβ receptor I and II kinase activity (25Maeda M. Shintani Y. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also tested the more specific SFK inhibitor SU6656, which does not inhibit TGFβ receptor function. As shown in Fig. 6C, SU6656 inhibited TGFβ1-induced β3 protein in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, SU6656 inhibited TGFβ1-induced p38 MAPK activation but not Smad3 phosphorylation (Fig. 6D). These results further support a role for autocrine integrin signaling in TGFβ1-induced β3 expression and suggest that c-Src kinase and p38 MAPK activation, but not Smad3, is a"
https://openalex.org/W1979926928,"Extracellular adenosine has been implicated as an innate antiinflammatory metabolite, particularly during conditions of limited oxygen availability such as ischemia. Because extracellular adenosine generation is primarily produced via phosphohydrolysis from its precursor molecule adenosine-monophosphate (AMP) through the enzyme ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73), we examined the contribution of CD73-dependent adenosine production in modulation of intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Following transcriptional and translational profiling of intestinal tissue that revealed a prominent induction of murine CD73, we next determined the role of CD73 in protection against intestinal IR injury. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition or targeted gene deletion of CD73 significantly enhanced not only local intestinal injury, but also secondary organ injury, following IR as measured by intestinal and lung myeloperoxidase, aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, interleukin (IL) -1, IL-6, and histological injury. To confirm the role of CD73 in intestinal adenosine production, we measured adenosine tissue levels and found that they were increased with IR injury. In contrast, CD73-deficient (cd73(-/-)) mice had lower adenosine levels at baseline and no increase with IR injury. Finally, reconstitution of cd73(-/-) mice or treatment of wild-type mice with soluble 5'-nucleotidase was associated with significantly lower levels of injury. These data reveal a previously unrecognized role of CD73 in attenuating intestinal IR-mediated injury."
https://openalex.org/W1970811961,"Ectodomain shedding of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the two proteases α- and β-secretase is a key regulatory event in the generation of the Alzheimer disease amyloid β peptide (Aβ). β-Secretase catalyzes the first step in Aβ generation, whereas α-secretase cleaves within the Aβ domain, prevents Aβ generation, and generates a secreted form of APP with neuroprotective properties. At present, little is known about the cellular mechanisms that control APP α-secretase cleavage and Aβ generation. To explore the contributory pathways, we carried out an expression cloning screen. We identified a novel member of the sorting nexin (SNX) family of endosomal trafficking proteins, called SNX33, as a new activator of APP α-secretase cleavage. SNX33 is a homolog of SNX9 and was found to be a ubiquitously expressed phosphoprotein. Exogenous expression of SNX33 in cultured cells increased APP α-secretase cleavage 4-fold but surprisingly had little effect on β-secretase cleavage. This effect was similar to the expression of the dominant negative dynamin-1 mutant K44A. SNX33 bound the endocytic GTPase dynamin and reduced the rate of APP endocytosis in a dynamin-dependent manner. This led to an increase of APP at the plasma membrane, where α-secretase cleavage mostly occurs. In summary, our study identifies SNX33 as a new endocytic protein, which modulates APP endocytosis and APP α-secretase cleavage, and demonstrates that the rate of APP endocytosis is a major control factor for APP α-secretase cleavage.

Schenk D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 545-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Both α- and β-secretase cleave APP within its ectodomain close to its transmembrane domain (Fig. 1A). The β-secretase is the aspartyl protease BACE1 and cleaves APP at the N terminus of the Aβ peptide domain, thus catalyzing the first step in Aβ peptide generation (2Citron M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 92-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). After the initial cleavage of APP by BACE1, the remaining C-terminal APP fragment is cleaved by γ-secretase within its transmembrane domain at the C terminus of the Aβ domain, leading to the secretion of the Aβ peptide (3Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). In contrast to β-secretase, α-secretase cleaves within the Aβ sequence, and thereby precludes Aβ peptide generation. The α-secretase is a member of the ADAM family of proteases and may be ADAM10, ADAM17 (TACE), or ADAM9 (4Allinson T.M. Parkin E.T. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. J. Neurosci.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7707-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, shifting APP shedding away from β- toward α-secretase cleavage could be therapeutically beneficial for AD. In order to do so, it is essential to understand the cellular pathways that control to what extent APP shedding occurs by α- or β-secretase. However, to date little is known about such cellular pathways (9Huovila A.P. Turner A.J. Pelto-Huikko M. Karkkainen I. Ortiz R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). For example, activation of certain kinases, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase C, increases APP α-cleavage, but it remains unclear how these kinases finally mediate the increase in APP shedding. An additional mechanism controlling APP α- and β-secretase cleavage may be the intracellular localization and in particular the endocytic trafficking of APP, which occurs in a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent manner. The α-secretase cleaves mostly at the cell surface, whereas β-secretase cleavage takes place after endocytosis of wild-type APP into endosomes. In fact, APP lacking its cytoplasmic internalization motif accumulates at the plasma membrane and undergoes increased α-secretase but a strongly reduced β-secretase cleavage (10Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Oltersdorf T. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, expression of the dynamin K44A mutant, which interferes with dynamin-dependent endocytosis in a dominant-negative manner, inhibits APP internalization from the plasma membrane and alters APP shedding. However, conflicting results have been reported as to whether this mainly affects the α- or the β-secretase cleavage or both of them (12Carey R.M. Balcz B.A. Lopez-Coviella I. Slack B.E. BMC Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13Chyung J.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51035-51043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of Rab5, a key regulator of endocytosis, increases APP internalization from the plasma membrane and enhances APP cleavage by β-secretase, leading to increased Aβ levels (14Grbovic O.M. Mathews P.M. Jiang Y. Schmidt S.D. Dinakar R. Summers-Terio N.B. Ceresa B.P. Nixon R.A. Cataldo A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31261-31268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Interestingly, endosomal abnormalities, which are similar to Rab5-overexpressing cells and which are consistent with increased APP endocytosis and cleavage by β-secretase, are among the earliest neuropathological changes observed in AD brain (15Nixon R.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 2005; 26: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), indicating that altered APP endocytosis might contribute to AD pathology. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms controlling APP endocytosis and, thus, the availability of APP for α- and β-secretase are not yet well understood. Endocytosis in general is a highly coordinated process with a key role in cellular homeostasis (16Le Roy C. Wrana J.L. Nat. Rev. 2005; 6: 112-126Crossref Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 17Mayor S. Pagano R.E. Nat. Rev. 2007; 8: 603-612Crossref Scopus (1183) Google Scholar) and affects distinct properties of cell surface membrane proteins, such as their biological function, signaling, and degradation. A number of different proteins are involved in the orchestration of the endocytic process (17Mayor S. Pagano R.E. Nat. Rev. 2007; 8: 603-612Crossref Scopus (1183) Google Scholar, 18Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref Scopus (2730) Google Scholar). Among them are the large GTPase dynamin, which is involved in the scission of the endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane, and the small GTPase Rab5 that is required for the transport of the vesicles and their fusion with the endosomes. However, not all mechanisms controlling endocytosis are understood, and new proteins with a function in endocytic protein trafficking continue to be identified. One such example is sorting nexin 9 (SNX9), a member of the heterogenous family of SNXs (19Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 919-931Crossref Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 20Carlton J. Bujny M. Rutherford A. Cullen P. Traffic. 2005; 6: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). SNXs are cytosolic and membrane-associated proteins characterized by the presence of an SNX-type Phox homology (PX) domain, which is a subgroup of the phosphoinositide-binding PX domain superfamily (21Teasdale R.D. Loci D. Houghton F. Karlsson L. Gleeson P.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Additionally, SNXs contain a variable number of additional protein-protein and protein-lipid interaction domains (20Carlton J. Bujny M. Rutherford A. Cullen P. Traffic. 2005; 6: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). At present, few SNXs have been functionally studied, but they are generally assumed to be involved in endosomal trafficking. For example, SNX1 is part of the retromer complex and is involved in the retrieval of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor from sorting endosomes (20Carlton J. Bujny M. Rutherford A. Cullen P. Traffic. 2005; 6: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). SNX9 is involved in endocytosis and binds different endocytic proteins, among them dynamin (22Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46772-46781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 23Soulet F. Yarar D. Leonard M. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2058-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Whether SNXs contribute to APP endocytosis or processing has not yet been established. To explore systematically the cellular pathways controlling APP shedding, we employed sib selection expression cloning and identified proteins activating APP shedding by α- or β-secretase. With this approach, we identified a novel member of the SNX family, SNX33, as a new modulator of APP endocytosis and α-secretase cleavage. We find that SNX33 is a novel dynamin-binding protein that inhibits dynamin-dependent endocytosis. Expression of SNX33 reduces the rate of APP endocytosis and increases APP levels at the cell surface, where APP undergoes increased cleavage by α-secretase.

Neurodegener. Dis. 2006; 3: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Polyclonal HEK293 cells stably expressing pSuper plasmids were selected with 100 μg/ml hygromycin. Polyclonal COS cells stably expressing APP695 were selected in 3.0 μg/μl hygromycin. Transfections were done using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). One day after the transfection, medium was changed. After additional overnight incubation, cell lysates (in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) and media were collected and analyzed. Cells stably expressing pSuper vectors (SNX33 knockdown) were prepared in the same way. For the indicated experiments, phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, phosphatase inhibitor (1:100; Sigma)) were added to cell lysates. The expression cloning screen was carried out as described (31Schobel S. Neumann S. Seed B. Lichtenthaler S.F. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To detect secreted and cellular APP or other cellular proteins, protein concentration in the cell lysate was measured, and corresponding aliquots of lysate or medium were separated by SDS-PAGE. Measurement of alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, APP and transferrin uptake assays, and image acquisition were performed as described (31Schobel S. Neumann S. Seed B. Lichtenthaler S.F. Int. J.

Preparation of Brain Homogenate, Cytosol, and Membrane Fraction from HEK293 Cells—Mouse brain was homogenated in brain lysis buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EGTA, protease inhibitors), centrifuged at 7,000 rpm. Supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min (4 °C). Pellet was resuspended in brain lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g (30 min, 4 °C). Cytosol and membrane fractions of HEK293 cells were prepared as described (22Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46772-46781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) under slightly modified conditions. Briefly, HEK293 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes. After 72 h, cells were scraped using PBS plus 25 mm EDTA, washed once with PBS, centrifuged at 350 × g, and washed twice with KSHM buffer (100 mm KCH3COO, 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 85 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, phosphatase inhibitor (1:100; Sigma)). Cells were centrifuged at 850 × g, resuspended in KSHM buffer, quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and thawed in a 37 °C water bath twice (the volume of KSHM buffer used was equivalent to the volume of centrifuged cells). Cells were centrifuged; supernatant of opened cells was collected and subjected to ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C and 100,000 × g. Aliquots of the resulting supernatant (cytosol) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Pellet was resolved in lysis buffer, incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C and 13,000 rpm. This supernatant (membrane fraction) was stored at –20 °C. Before immunoprecipitation, cytosol and membrane fraction were ultracentrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min and 100,000 × g. Additionally, 1% Nonidet P-40 was added to the cytosolic fraction to reduce nonspecific binding in the immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations and Dephosphorylation—For SNX33/dynamin co-immunoprecipitation, phosphatase inhibitors (described above) were added to the cell lysates. Lysates were incubated with 5 μg of antibody (anti-HA (12CA5) or anti-dynamin-1 (Hudy1)) for 4 h (4°C) using protein-G Dynabeads (Dynal). After washing with STEN-NaCl (STEN buffer plus 0.35 m NaCl) and twice with STEN (0.05 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40), bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. For anti-HA immunoprecipitations (HA.11, for the dephosphorylation experiment) lysates were incubated with antibody (300:1) and treated or not with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 37 °C in the presence of protease inhibitors. For SNX33 immunoprecipitation, antibody 67 (polyclonal) was used at a 1:100 dilution or antibody 2A1 (monoclonal) was used at a 1:10 dilution with protein-A- and protein-G-Sepharose, respectively. Cell Surface Biotinylation—48 h after transfection, HEK293 cells (in poly-l -lysine-coated 24-well dishes) were washed on ice three times with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 30 min on ice with PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml EZ-link™-Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce). Cells were washed three times with ice-cold 20 mm glycine plus PBS. The last wash was left for 15 min on cells (on ice). After three additional washes with ice-cold PBS, cell lysates were prepared. To detect biotinylated APP, protein concentration in the cell lysate was measured, and corresponding aliquots of lysate were used for immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C using Streptavidin-Sepharose High Performance (Amersham Biosciences). Northern Blot Analysis—Multiple-tissue Northern blot analysis was performed according to the supplier's protocol (Clontech, BD Biosciences). Briefly, a [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences)-labeled SNX33 or actin probe (Random Primer DNA Labeling System; Invitrogen) was added to a human multiple-tissue Northern blot (BD Biosciences). Hybridization was performed overnight at 65 °C. Excess probe was removed by washing with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, followed by washing with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The blot was exposed to Super RX film (Fuji). Purification of GST Fusion Proteins and GST Pull-down—GST proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). GST-SNX33 was eluted using 8 m urea. For in vitro binding studies, HEK293 lysates were incubated with 30 μl of GST or GST-SH3 fusion protein coupled to GSH-Sepharose beads. Equal amounts of GST and GST-SH3 fusion protein were used (estimated by Coomassie Blue staining). Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h and washed five times with 1 ml of STEN buffer. Co-precipitated dynamin was detected using dynamin-1/2 antibody. Retroviral Transduction—For the transduction of HeLa cells and H4 neuroglioma cells, retroviral supernatants (replication-deficient Moloney murine leukemia virus) were generated as described (30Kuhn P.H. Marjaux E. Imhof A. De Strooper B. Haass C. Lichtenthaler S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11982-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), using peak12/MMP-GFP or peak12/MMP-SNX33-IRES-GFP. Trichloroacetic Acid Precipitation—One confluent 10-cm dish was lysed in 800 μl of solubilization buffer. 88 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid solution were added. After a 10-min incubation on ice, precipitate was pelleted in a microcentrifuge and washed twice with ice-cold acetone. Pellet was dried in heat block (50 °C), resuspended in 2.3× sample buffer containing 6 m urea, and heated for 10 min at 95 °C. Trichloroacetic acid precipitate was resolved on 10% acrylamide gels containing 2.8 m urea and subject to immunoblot analysis. Caenorhabditis elegans Strains—The following strains were used: N2 Bristol (wild type), CX51 dyn-1(ky51), BR3380 Ex[lst-4::gfp] line 1, BR3381 Ex[lst-4::gfp] line 2, ZH301 Ex[dyn-1a/b::gfp], BR4825 Ex[dyn-1a/b::gfp; lst-4::gfp]. lst-4::gfp Expression—A lst-4::gfp translational fusion was constructed by cloning a 2.4-kb upstream regulatory sequence and complete cDNA of lst-4 (Y37A1B.2c) into pPD95.75 (A. Fire; Carnegie Institute of Washington, Baltimore, MD). 20 ng/μl was injected into N2 together with rol-6 (pRF4; 80 ng/μl) as coinjection marker (33Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2454) Google Scholar). The injection yielded two independent transgenic lines (BR3380 and BR3381) that were used for further functional analysis. To generate BR4825 for rescue experiments, Ex[lst-4::gfp] (BR3380) was crossed into Ex[dyn-1a/b::gfp] (ZH301). Identification of SNX33 in an Expression Cloning Screen for Activators of APP Shedding—To identify new modulators of APP shedding by α- or β-secretase, an expression cloning screen was performed. To this aim, cDNAs of an unamplified human adult brain cDNA library were transfected into a reporter cell line, which allows rapid detection of APP shedding in a high throughput format. The reporter cell line consists of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, which stably express a fusion protein of AP and full-length APP (AP-APP) (Fig. 1A) (31Schobel S. Neumann S. Seed B. Lichtenthaler S.F. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Upon cleavage of APP by α- or β-secretase, the secreted fusion protein can be detected in the conditioned medium by measuring the AP activity (28Lichtenthaler S.F. Dominguez D.I. Westmeyer G.G. Reiss K. Haass C. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Seed B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48713-48719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 31Schobel S. Neumann S. Seed B. Lichtenthaler S.F. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To protect the cells against possible cell death induced by proapoptotic genes represented in the cDNA pools, the HEK293 cells were additionally transfected with a plasmid encoding the cDNAs of two antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-XL and CrmA. Three cDNAs were obtained, which increased AP-APP secretion at least 4-fold compared with control-transfected cells. They had a stronger effect on APP shedding than the well characterized α-secretase ADAM10, which was used as a positive control and increased shedding 2-fold (Fig. 1B). First, the known APP β-secretase BACE1 (34Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J.

Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar) was identified, which validates the screening approach, since it shows that cDNAs can be obtained that are physiologically relevant for APP shedding. Second, a partial cDNA of the endocytic GTPase dynamin-1 was identified, encoding a truncated dynamin-1 lacking the N-terminal 209 amino acids, including the GTPase domain (DynΔNT). This protein is expected to act as a dominant negative dynamin mutant (35Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). DynΔNT increased AP-APP shedding 5-fold and had an even stronger effect than the well characterized dynamin-1 K44A mutant (Fig. 1B), which was previously shown to inhibit APP endocytosis and increase APP shedding (12Carey R.M. Balcz B.A. Lopez-Coviella I. Slack B.E. BMC Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13Chyung J.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51035-51043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As a control, expression of wild-type dynamin, which does not inhibit endocytosis, did not affect APP shedding (Fig. 1B). A third cDNA encodes a protein, which is identical to an as yet uncharacterized protein annotated as SNX33 or SH3PX3 (36Seet L.F. Hong W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 878-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). SNX33 increased APP shedding 4-fold (Fig. 1B). It did not affect the shedding of the corresponding AP fusion protein of the cell adhesion protein l -selectin (Fig. 1C) but increased the shedding of TNFR2 (tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 2) by 2-fold. l -selectin and TNFR2 undergo an α-secretase-like shedding similar to APP (28Lichtenthaler S.F.

As a control, to show that the shedding of l -selectin and TNFR2 can be enhanced in this assay, we used the kinase MEKK2, which strongly activated the shedding of both proteins (Fig. 1C). The novel protein SNX33 comprises 574 amino acids"
https://openalex.org/W2002716147,"KLF8 (Krüppel-like factor 8) is a transcription factor downstream of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) important in the regulation of the cell cycle and also plays a critical role in oncogenic transformation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Here we report the mechanisms by which FAK regulates KLF8 expression in human ovarian epithelial and cancer cells. We show that the overexpression of both KLF8 and FAK in the human ovarian cancer cells as compared with the normal human ovarian surface epithelial cells is critical for cell growth. Using promoter luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrate that exogenous FAK strongly promotes the activity of the KLF8 promoter, and knockdown of FAK inhibits it. KLF8 promoter activity and mRNA levels are induced by expression of constitutively active (CA) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or CA-Akt but are repressed by dominant negative Akt or the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Disruption of an Sp1 binding site in the KLF8 promoter abolishes the FAK- or Sp1-mediated promoter activation. Sp1 knockdown prevents the KLF8 promoter from being activated by Sp1 or CA-Akt, and expression of CA-Akt enhances Sp1 expression in SKOV3ip1 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and oligonucleotide precipitation results show that Sp1 binds to the KLF8 promoter. Taken together, our data suggest that FAK induces KLF8 expression in human ovarian cancer cells by activating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, leading to the activation of KLF8 promoter by Sp1."
https://openalex.org/W2081946112,"Calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) occur in all classes of chondritic meteorites and contain refractory minerals predicted to be the first condensates from the solar nebula. Near-infrared spectra of CAIs have strong 2-micrometer absorptions, attributed to iron oxide-bearing aluminous spinel. Similar absorptions are present in the telescopic spectra of several asteroids; modeling indicates that these contain approximately 30 +/- 10% CAIs (two to three times that of any meteorite). Survival of these undifferentiated, large (50- to 100-kilometer diameter) CAI-rich bodies suggests that they may have formed before the injection of radiogenic 26Al into the solar system. They have also experienced only modest post-accretionary alteration. Thus, these asteroids have higher concentrations of CAI material, appear less altered, and are more ancient than any known sample in our meteorite collection, making them prime candidates for sample return."
https://openalex.org/W1971283175,"The critical tumor suppressor p53 is mutated or functionally inactivated in nearly all cancers. We have shown previously that the MDM2-MDMX complex functions as an integral unit in targeting p53 for degradation. Here we identify the small protein 14-3-3 as a binding partner of MDMX, which binds at the C terminus (Ser367) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Importantly, we demonstrate that the serine/threonine kinase Akt mediates phosphorylation of MDMX at Ser367. This phosphorylation leads to stabilization of MDMX and consequent stabilization of MDM2. Previous studies have shown that Akt phosphorylates and stabilizes MDM2. Our data suggest that stabilization of MDMX by Akt may be an alternative mechanism by which Akt up-regulates MDM2 protein levels and exerts its oncogenic effects on p53 in tumor cells.

Our data suggest that stabilization of MDMX by Akt may be an alternative mechanism by which Akt up-regulates MDM2 protein levels and exerts its oncogenic effects on p53 in tumor cells. The p53 tumor suppressor is a critical regulator of cell proliferation. In response to cellular stresses, p53 elicits a response that results in cell cycle arrest or cell death. The activation of p53 occurs in a robust manner, and its proper regulation is therefore critical to maintain normal cellular functions (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5798) Google Scholar). The MDM2 protein is one key regulator of p53 activity. The manner by which MDM2 inhibits p53 activity is 2-fold. First, MDM2 binds to the transactivation domain of p53, preventing transcription of downstream targets. Second, and perhaps more importantly, MDM2 functions as an E3 ligase to maintain low protein levels of p53 under non-stressed conditions and to return p53 to normal levels after a damage response is resolved (2Michael D. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). More recently, a close homologue of MDM2, MDMX, has been shown to be another critical regulator of p53 activity (3Finch R.A. Donoviel D.B. Potter D. Shi M. Fan A. Freed D.D. Wang C.Y. Zambrowicz B.P.

Of interest, MDM2 and MDMX have been found amplified in certain cancers that retain wild-type p53, indicating that these critical negative regulators of p53 contribute to its inactivation and thus promote cell proliferation (12Danovi D.

The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt promotes cell survival and proliferation. Akt is responsible for stimulating pro-survival signals through its kinase activity (15Downward J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 16Brazil D.P. Park J.

Pelletier J. Lowe S.W. Nature. 2004; 428: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). One example is the phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic Forkhead family of transcription factors. Following phosphorylation by Akt, a binding site is generated for the 14-3-3 protein, which in turn binds to and inactivates FOXO proteins by promoting their nuclear export (18Obsil T. Ghirlando R. Anderson D.E. Hickman A.B. Dyda F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15264-15272Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 19You H. Jang Y. You-Ten A.I. Okada H. Liepa J. Wakeham A. Zaugg K. Mak T.W. Proc.

Another example of the pro-survival function of Akt is its ability to phosphorylate the pro-apoptotic protein Bad. Phosphorylation of Bad leads to 14-3-3 binding and results in loss of its ability to induce mitochondrial membrane permeability, thus preventing initiation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (21Hermeking H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins are small acidic proteins that bind to phosphorylated serine/threonine residues as dimers. There are seven known isoforms of 14-3-3 in humans. They modify the function of their partner proteins by a multitude of mechanisms such as sequestration, alteration of protein-protein interactions, alteration of enzymatic activity, or by functioning as adaptor proteins (21Hermeking H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 22Dougherty M.K. Morrison D.K. J.

In several cases, protein phosphorylation by Akt generates a 14-3-3 binding site; both the Akt consensus sequence and the 14-3-3 binding sequence are similar (21Hermeking H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 22Dougherty M.K. Morrison D.K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 23Yaffe M.B.

Here we show that Akt is capable of phosphorylating MDMX on Ser367, generating a 14-3-3 binding site; this phosphorylation renders it more stable, thereby enhancing MDM2 stability. Moreover, this translates into p53 inactivation by preventing p53 transcriptional activity. Our work suggests that Akt is able to functionally inactivate p53 through its regulation of MDMX and thereby contributes to the oncogenic activity of Akt. Preparation of Plasmids and Proteins—pcDNA3-MDMX(S367A) and pcDNA3-MDMX(P369R) mutants were generated by two-step site-directed PCR mutagenesis utilizing the following primers: Ser367 to Ala, 5′-TGTCGA-AGAACCATTGCGGCTCCTGTCGTT and 3′-TCTAAC-GACAGGAGCCGCAATGGTTCTTCG; and Pro369 to Arg, 5′-ATTTCGGCTCGAGTCGTTAGA and 3′-TCTAACGAC-TCGAGCCGAAAT. Plasmids containing constitutively active, myristoylated, hemagglutinin-tagged Akt with and without the pleckstrin homology domain and dominant-negative, hemagglutinin-tagged Akt(K179M) and Akt(T308A,S473A) were kind gifts of Drs.

Chen D. Rosenblum J. Rubin R.M. Yuan Z.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Generation of Inducible Cell Lines—Full-length FLAG-MDMX, full-length FLAG-MDM2, FLAG-MDMX RFD, and FLAG-MDM2 RFD were cloned into pcDNA4 (Invitrogen). Plasmids were linearized and transfected into 293-TREx cells (Invitrogen). Cells were put under Zeocin (Invitrogen) selection, and positive clones that expressed the insert of interest under tetracycline were chosen. Immunoaffinity Purification and Mass Spectrometry—Cells were induced with tetracycline, and cells were harvested 24 h post-induction. Cell lysates were prepared in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer and incubated with preconjugated agarose beads with anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma). After boiling in Laemmli buffer, lysates were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Gel was fixed in methanol and stained with Coomassie Blue. Gel bands were excised, washed in acetonitrile, and sent for digestion and tandem mass spectrometry (NIEHS Harvard School of Public Health Proteomics Facility, Boston, MA). Cell Culture and Transfection—293T, 293-TREx, H1299, U2OS, OVCA420, LNCaP, and MCF7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in minimal essential medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, or RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For serum starvation, cells were maintained in serum-free minimal essential medium for 15–18 h and then stimulated with human recombinant IGF-1 (Sigma) at 10–50 ng/ml. For experiments with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, cells grown in serum-free medium were pretreated with 10 μm LY294002 (Sigma) for 30 min and then treated with IGF-1 as described above. Transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation or the Lipofectamine method (Invitrogen). Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Cells were transfected in 60-mm plates with 1–5 μg of DNA and harvested 24 h post-transfection. Cells were lysed as described previously (40Kawai H. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4939-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay. After addition of 5×Laemmli buffer, the samples were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were prepared in 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer and incubated with anti-FLAG M5 beads (Sigma) for an additional 2 h. Immune complexes and whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with the following antibodies as indicated: anti-MDMX (BL1258, Bethyl Laboratories), anti-MDMX pS367 (a kind gift of Dr. Jiandong Chen) or BL1563 where noted, anti-MDM2 (Ab-1, Oncogene), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-p53 (Ab-6, Oncogene), anti-Akt pS473 (Cell Signaling), anti-Akt (Cell Signaling), anti-pan-14-3-3β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p21 (187, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-β-actin (AC-15, Sigma). Proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In Vitro Kinase Assay—293T cells were transiently transfected with constitutively active or dominant-negative Akt. Another set of 293T cells was transiently transfected with FLAG-MDMX plasmids. MDMX immunoprecipitates were incubated with lysates expressing constitutively active or dominant-negative Akt in kinase assay buffer in the presence of 10 mm [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Samples were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography. 14-3-3 Is a Novel MDMX Binding Partner—To identify novel binding partners of MDMX, a proteomic screen was performed. An inducible cell line was utilized to express a full-length FLAG-tagged MDMX or MDM2 protein, as well as a FLAG-tagged mini-protein encoding the zinc RFDs of MDMX (amino acids 301–490) or MDM2 (amino acids 302–491). Tetracycline was used to induce the expression of these FLAG-tagged proteins in 293-TREx cells, and anti-FLAG antibody was used to purify the FLAG-tagged protein complexes. Immunoprecipitates were separated using SDS-PAGE, and unique bands were cut and sent for identification by mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 1A, a unique band associated with full-length MDMX and the zinc RING finger domain of MDMX but not with MDM2. Results from mass spectrometry analysis revealed that this band corresponded to the protein 14-3-3. The interaction between MDMX and 14-3-3 was verified in vitro using recombinant GST-MDMX fusion proteins (Fig. 1B). Upon careful analysis of the MDMX sequence, we identified a 14-3-3 mode 1 binding motif (RXXSXP) in residues 364–369 (Fig. 1C, underlined). Additionally, the presence of a 14-3-3 binding motif in the MDMX sequence was confirmed using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Scansite program (41Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). This sequence is specific to MDMX, as it is not found in the MDM2 sequence, further supporting our immunoprecipitation results (Fig. 1C, underlined). 14-3-3 proteins are small acidic proteins that typically interact with their ligands in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. To investigate whether 14-3-3 bound to MDMX in this manner, we subjected Ser367 to point-directed mutagenesis. Using site-directed PCR, we mutated the putative 14-3-3 binding site on MDMX from serine to alanine. As shown in Fig. 1D, the MDMX(S367A) point mutant was unable to bind 14-3-3 proteins. To rule out the possibility that alteration of the phosphorylation status of MDMX interferes with 14-3-3 binding, we mutated a conserved proline residue to an arginine, thereby eliminating the 14-3-3 binding motif. This MDMX(P369R) mutant was also unable to bind to 14-3-3, indicating that 14-3-3 is a bona fide binding partner of MDMX (Fig. 1D). We next performed a GST pulldown assay using GST-14-3-3β and GST-14-3-3ζ to demonstrate direct binding of the C-terminal MDMX RFD (Fig. 1E). Immunoprecipitation of Myc-14-3-3 showed binding of full-length MDMX to 14-3-3 (Fig. 1F). In total, we observed binding of MDMX to the four 14-3-3 isoforms (β, ϵ, γ (data not shown), and ζ) we had available, but not to 14-3-3σ, which has been shown to be a p53 target gene (data not shown) (21Hermeking H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Further evidence for specific 14-3-3 binding was shown using the 14-3-3 competitive inhibitor difopein. 14-3-3 binding to the MDMX RFD in the presence of difopein was not observed (Fig. 1G). Additionally, point mutations of MDMX or disruption of 14-3-3 binding did not interfere with binding to MDM2 (data not shown). MDMX Is a Substrate of the Akt Kinase—14-3-3 proteins normally bind phosphorylated targets. Therefore, we investigated which kinase was responsible for phosphorylation of MDMX at Ser367. The sequence surrounding Ser367 appears to fit the consensus site RXRXXS of the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt. Although the sequence is not a perfect match, we tested whether the Akt pathway was mediating phosphorylation of MDMX. An in vitro kinase assay showed that Akt phosphorylated wild-type MDMX, but not the S367A mutant of MDMX (Fig. 2A). The residual band observed in the MDMX(S367A) lane suggests that Ser367 is the primary site for Akt-mediated phosphorylation; however, there may be other, yet uncharacterized Akt sites on MDMX. To further assess whether Akt was mediating phosphorylation of Ser367, FLAG immunoprecipitation was carried out on 293T cells cotransfected with FLAG-MDMX and either constitutively active Akt (CA-Akt) or dominant-negative Akt (DN-Akt). Western blot analysis utilizing a phospho-Ser367-specific antibody indicated that MDMX is indeed phosphorylated at this site in an Akt-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, when CA-Akt was coexpressed with MDMX, we also observed stabilization of MDMX, whereas the protein level of the S367A phosphorylation-deficient mutant was largely unchanged (Fig. 2B). Recent studies have shown that Ser367 of MDMX is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage. To test whether phosphorylation of Ser367 is specific to the DNA damage response, we compared the phosphorylation status of MDMX in response to Adriamycin treatment in cells transfected with CA-Akt or DN-Akt. Phosphorylation of Ser367 was observed in the presence of CA-Akt or vector only, as well as Adriamycin, but not KD-Akt (Fig. 2C). These results suggest, quite interestingly, that Ser367 phosphorylation is not a response specific to DNA damage. Of note, Akt-mediated phosphorylation was even stronger than Adriamycin-induced phosphorylation, implicating Akt as a physiologically relevant kinase for MDMX. We next investigated the status of 14-3-3 binding with respect to Akt activity. Cotransfection of MDMX with CA-Akt led to 14-3-3 binding, whereas no binding was observed in the presence of DN-Akt (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that phosphorylation of Ser367 is required for 14-3-3 binding. Addition of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 elicited the same effect on MDMX/14-3-3 binding as did DN-Akt (Fig. 2D). To determine whether endogenous Akt is capable of stabilizing MDMX, we treated MCF7 cells with IGF-1 to activate the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway after serum starvation. As suggested by previous experiments, endogenous MDMX is stabilized by activation of the Akt pathway because MDMX protein levels increase in response to IGF-1 treatment after serum starvation; addition of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 appears to diminish MDMX levels (Fig. 3A). These observations correlate with the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, which has been shown to be a good indicator of Akt activity. Additionally, the stabilization of MDMX in response to IGF-1 treatment was dose-dependent (Fig. 3B). These experiments suggest that endogenous MDMX protein levels are regulated by the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Stabilization of MDMX Results in Stabilization of MDM2 and Down-regulation of p53 Activity—Constitutively active Akt has been shown to function in a manner that promotes cell survival and proliferation, in part by stabilizing MDM2 and thus down-regulating p53 activity (24Ashcroft M.

Our data support the hypothesis that Akt phosphorylates MDMX at Ser367, generates a 14-3-3 binding site, and leads to the binding of MDMX to 14-3-3, which results in its subsequent stabilization. Given the findings that MDMX is capable of stabilizing MDM2 and that the MDM2-MDMX heterocomplex is inherently more stable than the MDM2 homocomplex (10Kawai H. Lopez-Pajares V. Kim M.M. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.-M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6026-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 45Stad R. Ramos Y.F. Little N. Grivell S. Attema J. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 10901-10907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we asked whether the effect of Akt on MDM2 was mediated by MDMX. MDMX mutants were used to determine whether stabilization of MDM2 is dependent on MDMX in response to Akt activity. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt resulted in enhanced protein levels of wild-type MDMX, whereas overexpression of dominant-negative Akt did not (Fig. 4A). The levels of MDM2 are also increased in the presence of CA-Akt (Fig. 4A), as previous studies have shown. Interestingly, MDM2 levels appear to be unchanged in the presence of the MDMX(S367A) mutant (Fig. 4A). Moreover, coexpression with an MDMX RING mutant (C463A) that disrupts MDM2-MDMX binding failed to stabilize MDM2 levels, despite the fact that the RING mutant itself was stabilized by Akt. These data demonstrate that the stabilization of MDM2 by Akt is mediated by MDMX (Fig. 4A). To test whether the half-lives of MDM2 and MDMX are extended by Akt activity, we cotransfected 293T cells with MDM2, MDMX, and either constitutively active Akt or kinase-dead Akt. Cells were then treated with cycloheximide, and protein levels were tracked for the indicated time points (Fig. 4B). The half-lives of both MDM2 and MDMX were dramatically increased in the presence of Akt activity, supporting previous result. We next utilized a mammalian two-hybrid system to determine whether the presence of Akt increased the presence of an MDM2-MDMX complex. A luciferase reporter assay was used in which the reporter plasmid, pGal4-Luc, was coexpressed with a Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to MDM2, and the VP16-activation domain was fused to MDMX to determine MDM2-MDMX binding (Fig. 4B). We have reported previously that expression of the MDMX RFD is capable of disrupting MDM2-MDMX binding (10Kawai H. Lopez-Pajares V. Kim M.M. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.-M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6026-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); therefore, we used it as a negative control. In the presence of CA-Akt, we observed a 2-fold increase in signal compared with vector and KD-Akt, suggesting the ability of Akt to stabilize the MDM2-MDMX complex (Fig. 4B). To determine the effects of stabilization of MDMX on p53 activity, we utilized another reporter assay. This time we chose to assess the level of p53 transcriptional activity. A luciferase assay was performed by cotransfecting H1299 cells, which are p53-deficient, with the p53-specific pG13-Luc reporter plasmid, Myc-p53, and wild-type MDMX, along with CA-Akt or KD-Akt. As shown in Fig. 4C, luciferase activity is increased when p53 is introduced into these cells and decreased in the presence of MDMX. When CA-Akt is coexpressed with MDMX, there is a reduction of p53 activity, compared with CA-Akt alone; KD-Akt had no effect on the ability of MDMX to suppress p53 activity. These results suggest that MDMX contributes to p53 suppression under Akt activity. To further determine whether endogenous p53 and MDMX are affected by Akt, we utilized U2OS, LNCaP, and OVCA420 cells, the latter two of which have elevated Akt activity due to either phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deficiency (LNCaP) or Her-2 overexpression (OVCA420). We treated these cells with LY294002 to block Akt activity. In contrast with U2OS cells, in which Akt activity is relatively low, LNCaP and OVCA420 cells responded to the inhibitor with a significant decrease of Akt activity (Fig. 4D). LY294002 treatment also resulted in a decrease of MDMX steady-state levels, consistent with Akt-mediated stabilization of MDMX (Fig. 4D). Importantly, the effects of LY294002 correlated with increased p53 transcriptional activity (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that down-regulation of MDMX in response to suppression of Akt contributes to p53 activation. Together, our data show that one mechanism by which Akt elicits its oncogenic function is through the stabilization of MDMX, potentially through 14-3-3 binding. MDMX stability is then translated into the stabilization of MDM2 and inactivation of p53. A fundamental process in the development of cancer is the inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. In some cases, this is achieved by mutation of the TP53 gene, resulting in a mutant protein unable to carry out its function as a transcription factor, although some tumors retain wild-type p53 (47Chene P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). However, in those cases, p53 is functionally inactivated. One mechanism is through the up-regulation of the p53 negative regulator and E3 ligase MDM2. Amplifications of the MDM2 gene or stabilization of the MDM2 protein can result in the inactivation of p53 by increasing its degradation and inhibiting p53 transcriptional activity (25Feng J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3453-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the pro-survival serine/threonine protein kinase Akt phosphorylates MDM2, resulting in its stabilization and nuclear translocation. This eventually leads to a functional inactivation of p53 (24Ashcroft M. Ludwig R.L. Woods D.B. Copeland T.D. Weber H.O. MacRae E.J. Vousden K.H.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Although these results strongly suggest that MDM2 mediates Akt-dependent inactivation of p53, the exact mechanism by which it does this remains unclear. Some studies have shown that Akt results in MDM2 nuclear translocation, whereas others do not; however, all studies indicate that MDM2 is stabilized by Akt. MDM2 possesses E3 ligase activity toward itself, and some reports suggest that MDM2 is inherently unstable; however, its homologue and binding partner, MDMX, which lacks the E3 ligase activity, is involved in its stabilization (45Stad R. Ramos Y.F. Little N. Grivell S. Attema J. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28039-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). MDMX itself has been shown to be an essential negative regulator of p53 (4Parant J. Chavez-Reyes A. Little N.A. Yan W. Reinke V. Jochemsen A.G. Lozano G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 42Migliorini D. Denchi E.L. Danovi D. Jochemsen A. Capillo M. Gobbi A. Helin K. Pelicci P.G. Marine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5527-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that the MDM2-MDMX heterocomplex appears to be the predominant form in which both proteins exist in the cell and that disruption of this complex leads to MDM2 destabilization and p53 activation (10Kawai H. Lopez-Pajares V. Kim M.M. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.-M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6026-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In pursuit of MDMX binding partners, we identified the 14-3-3 proteins. With the exception of 14-3-3σ, a p53 downstream target, all other 14-3-3 isoforms tested bound to MDMX. Upon further investigation, we determined that the 14-3-3 binding site on MDMX is generated by Akt. It is the specific phosphorylation of Ser367 mediated by Akt that stabilizes MDMX. Furthermore, we have shown that stabilization of MDMX by Akt results in the subsequent stabilization of MDM2; this appears to be dependent on its binding to MDMX, as a RING mutant unable to bind to MDM2 was incapable of stabilizing MDM2 in the presence of Akt activity. Our data support that Akt-induced MDM2 stabilization is mediated at least in part through its effect on MDMX. Moreover, we have shown that the transcriptional activity of p53 is suppressed by Akt in an MDMX-dependent manner. We have also demonstrated that transcriptional activation of p53 correlates with decreased MDMX levels in response to a PI 3-kinase inhibitor that suppresses Akt activity. Recent studies have shown that MDMX is phosphorylated in response to DNA-damaging agents (43Meulmeester E. Maurice M.M. Boutell C. Teunisse A.F. Ovaa H. Abraham T.E. Dirks R.W. Jochemsen A.G. Mol.

The Chk1 and Chk2 kinases have also been shown to phosphorylate Ser367, leading to 14-3-3 binding (34Pereg Y. Lam S. Teunisse A. Biton S. Meulmeester E. Mittelman L. Buscemi G. Okamoto K. Taya Y.

In both cases, the outcome differed: in Chk1-mediated phosphorylation, MDMX was translocated to the cytoplasm; in Chk2-mediated phosphorylation, MDMX was degraded (34Pereg Y. Lam S. Teunisse A.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3411-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It is possible that the damage response is mediated through additional phosphorylation sites other than Ser367 and that, depending on the type of damage, certain sites will be modified, leading to different outcomes. We have observed the phosphorylation of Ser367 under both growth-promoting and DNA-damaging conditions, suggesting that phosphorylation of other sites may be required for MDMX degradation. Indeed, reports also show that Ser403 and Ser342 are phosphorylated in response to DNA damage; it is possible that these sites are more important in the damage response (34Pereg Y. Lam S. Teunisse A. Biton S. Meulmeester E. Mittelman L. Buscemi G. Okamoto K. Taya Y. Shiloh Y. Jochemsen A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6819-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), although more investigations will be necessary to address this issue. Furthermore, 14-3-3 proteins bind as dimers requiring two phosphorylation sites, and the function of 14-3-3 binding to MDMX is not yet clear. Although we have not observed an effect from 14-3-3 on altered or enhanced binding of MDMX to MDM2 (data not shown), we believe that Akt-mediated 14-3-3 binding leads to the stabilization of the MDM2-MDMX complex, most likely by preventing degradation of the complex. We also did not observe a change in translocation of MDMX when it was bound to 14-3-3 under growth-promoting conditions (data not shown). It is possible that under different cellular conditions, other 14-3-3 binding sites may be generated on MDMX, which may result in different outcomes. It is also possible that a 14-3-3 dimer binds MDMX and tethers it to another yet unknown protein under growth-promoting conditions. Our data fit with the general hypothesis that the Akt pathway is a pro-survival/pro-growth pathway. We have shown that Akt generates a 14-3-3 binding site on MDMX, which leads to its stabilization and consequent stabilization of MDM2. The MDM2-MDMX heterocomplex is therefore stabilized and more efficient at suppressing p53 activity. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2116260945,"Transglutaminase 2 (TGase2) is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme that catalyzes irreversible post-translational modification of protein, forming cross-linked protein aggregates. We previously reported that intracellular TGase2 is activated by oxidative stress. To elucidate the functional role of TGase2 activation in cells under the oxidatively stressed condition, we identified the mediator that activates TGase2. In this study, we showed that low levels of oxidative stress trigger the release of TGFbeta, which subsequently activates TGase2 through the nuclear translocation of Smad3. Analysis of substrate proteins reveals that TGase2-mediated protein modification results in a decrease of protein solubility and a collapse of intermediate filament network, which leads to aggregation of proteins. We confirm these results using lens tissues from TGase2-deficient mice. Among several antioxidants tried, only N-acetylcysteine effectively inhibits TGFbeta-mediated activation of TGase2. These results indicate that TGFbeta mediates oxidative stress-induced protein aggregation through activation of TGase2 and suggest that the formation of protein aggregation may not be a passive process of self-assembly of oxidatively damaged proteins but may be an active cellular response to oxidative stress. Therefore, TGFbeta-TGase2 pathway may have implications for both the pathogenesis of age-related degenerative diseases and the development of pharmaceutics."
https://openalex.org/W1985083242,"Phosphorylation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is essential for the induction of promoters which contain the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). IRF3 can be activated by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in response to the double-stranded RNA mimic poly(I-C) and by TLR4 in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here we have analyzed the effect of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone on this response. Dexamethasone inhibited the induction of the ISRE-dependent gene RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) in both U373-CD14 cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and also an ISRE luciferase construct, activated by either TLR3 or TLR4. It also inhibited increased phosphorylation of IRF3 in its N terminus in response to LPS and in its C terminus on Ser-396 in response to either poly(I-C) or LPS. Several dexamethasone-induced phosphatases were tested for possible involvement in these effects; MKP1 did not appear to be involved, although MKP2 and MKP5 both partially inhibited induction of the ISRE, pointing to their possible involvement in the effect of dexamethasone. Importantly, we found that dexamethasone could inhibit TBK1 kinase activity and TBK1 phosphorylation on Ser-172, both of which are required for IRF3 phosphorylation downstream of TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation. Our study, therefore, demonstrates that TBK1 is a target for dexamethasone, common to both TLR3 and TLR4 signaling."

Among various tested effectors, Pi was the preferred substrate. Although it competed with the uptake of Pi, glutamate was not transported by ANTR1 into E. coli. In relation to its function as a Pi transporter, several physiological roles for ANTR1 in the thylakoid membrane are proposed, such as export of Pi produced during nucleotide metabolism in the thylakoid lumen back to the chloroplast stroma and balance of the trans-thylakoid H+ electrochemical gradient storage.

Solute and metabolite transporters play essential roles in physiological processes, including nutrient uptake, cell homeostasis, signal transduction, growth, and stress responses in every living organism. In the plant chloroplast, the photosynthetic organelle, most transporters have been identified and biochemically characterized from the envelope membrane (1Rolland N. Ferro M. Seigneurin-Berny D.

Much less information is available for transport processes across the chloroplast thylakoid membrane, which is mostly studied as the site of light-driven photosynthetic reactions coupled to ATP synthesis.

A few Na+-coupled Pi transporters (NaPi) 6The abbreviations used are: ANTR, anion transporter; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β,D-galactopyranoside; NaPi, Na+ -dependent phosphate transporter; TMD, transmembrane domain; VGLUT, vesicular glutamate transporter. have in recent years been reported in green algae and vascular plants (7Reid R.J.

NaPi-II type plays the role of an intracellular Pi accumulation system, whereas NaPi-III type has the characteristics of a housekeeping system (9Werner A. Dehmelt L. Nalbant P. J. Exp.

Forster I.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: F643-F654Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). NaPi-I represents a group of proteins for which the endogenous substrate, ionic coupling, and physiological function are still under debate. Heterologous expression of the rabbit renal NaPi-1 and the human orthologue NPT1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes have implicated type I in Na+-dependent Pi transport as well as in a channel-like conductance of organic and inorganic anions (10Reimer R.J. Edwards R.H. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The first identified vesicular glutamate transporters, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2, were initially also characterized as NaPi-I type. Most recently, VGLUTs have been shown to transport glutamate as well as Pi by two independent mechanisms (12Juge N. Yoshida Y. Yatsushiro S. Omote H. Moriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39499-39506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In A. thaliana, there are six genes encoding anion transporters (ANTR1–6), sharing homology with the NaPi-I members. The ANTR1 and ANTR2 proteins have been localized to the chloroplast and the latter precisely assigned to the inner envelope using proteomics and immunodetection with a peptide-specific antibody (1Rolland N.

Moreover, no function of the ANTRs has yet been determined. In the present study, we show that the recombinantly expressed Arabidopsis ANTR1 facilitates Na+-dependent Pi transport into Escherichia coli. This bacterium contains two H+-coupled Pi uptake systems, namely the low affinity system Pit and the high affinity system Pst (14Rao N.N. Torriani A. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar). Membrane topology was analyzed using a package of programs at the ARAMEMNON Web site and another one at PRODIV-TMHMM (18Schwacke R. Schneider A. van der Graaff E. Fischer K. Catoni E. Desimone M.

Cloning and Heterologous Expression of His6-Xpress-ANTR1-FLAG Fusion Protein in E. coli—The Arabidopsis At2g29650 (ANTR1 gene) was PCR-amplified from the RAFL09-06-K07 cDNA clone (RIKEN BioResource Center, Ref. 16Seki M.

The PCR product was inserted between the PstI and HindIII sites in the pTrcHisC vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into E. coli TOP10F' cells. Such a fusion construct has recently been successfully employed to express another thylakoid transporter (6Thuswaldner S. Lagerstedt J.O. Rojas-Stütz M. Bouhidel K. Der C. Leborgne-Castel N.

The authenticity of the vector construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transformed (EANTR1) and control (carrying an empty plasmid) E. coli cells were precultivated overnight in Terrific Broth medium containing 70 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (TB-Pi), supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and re-inoculated to an A600 of 0.6 in fresh TB-Pi medium, supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 100 μm IPTG for induction. Cultures were grown aerobically at 200 rpm and 25 °C, and aliquots were harvested by centrifugation (8000 × g, 5 min) every 2 h during an 8-h induction period. Harvested cells were stored at –80 °C prior to electrophoretic analyses. Assay of Pi and Glutamate Uptake into E. coli Cells—Transformed and control cells were induced with IPTG for 4 h, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended to an A600 of 0.3 in TB medium (no added Pi), and starved for 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 25 mm Tris-succinate buffer, pH 6.5. Pi uptake was assayed by the addition of 1 μl of [32P]orthophosphate (50 mCi/mmol; 1 mCi = 37 MBq; GE Healthcare) to a final concentration of 100 μm in 20-μl aliquots, each containing 2 mg (wet weight) of cells in Tris-succinate buffer, pH 6.5, supplemented with 3% glucose, in the absence or presence of 25 mm NaCl. The suspension was incubated at 25 °C for the indicated time periods. Pi transport was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 25 mm Tris-succinate buffer, pH 6.5, and rapid filtration under vacuum as previously described (6Thuswaldner S. Lagerstedt J.O. Rojas-Stütz M. Bouhidel K. Der C. Leborgne-Castel N. Mishra A. Marty F. Schoefs B. Adamska I. Persson B.L. Spetea C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8848-8859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Following three washes with the same ice-cold buffer, the radioactivity retained on the filter was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Similar assays were carried out in 25 mm Tris-succinate buffer, pH 5.5 and 7.5. For determination of the transport affinity (Km) and maximal rate (Vmax), uptake of 32Pi was carried out using a range of concentrations of 0 to 500 μm. When the effect of Na+ concentration on Pi uptake was measured, the amount of Pi was kept constant (100 μm) and the amount of NaCl added to the reaction mixture was varied (0–50 mm). Choline chloride was used to replace NaCl in some experiments to verify the importance of Na+versus Cl–. Where indicated, the uptake experiments were carried out using 100 μm32Pi in competition with 2.5 mm nonlabeled effectors. For uptake inhibition experiments, E. coli cells were preincubated for 2 min with the Na+ ionophore monensin (100 μm) before the addition of 100 μm32Pi. For glutamate transport experiments, control and EANTR1 cells were first incubated for 30 min in 25 mm Tris-succinate buffer, pH 6.5, followed by washing with the same buffer. The uptake was assayed as described above for Pi but using 100 μm l-[3,4-3H]glutamate (500 mCi/mmol; 1 mCi = 37 MBq; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 25 mm Tris-succinate buffer, pH 6.5, supplemented with 3% glucose and 25 mm NaCl. The data throughout this study represent the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments with three replicates. Protein Analysis—Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 14% (w/v) acrylamide-SDS gels and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies directed toward epitopes within the protein or the fused tags. An ANTR1-specific antibody was produced in rabbit against a peptide corresponding to the 15 residues within the N terminus of the protein (73–88, CEGDKVSGNNDVVSDSP) and purified by affinity chromatography (Innovagen, Lund, Sweden). Another antibody was produced in rabbit against the peptide 427–443 (CSQGTDAFSQSGLYSN), common for ANTR1 and ANTR2. Where indicated, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal (Sigma) and anti-Xpress (Invitrogen) antibodies were also used. To verify the purity of the chloroplast fractions, antibodies against the envelope TIC110 protein (gift from Prof. J. Soll, Munich University) and the thylakoid LHCII protein (Agrisera, Umeå, Sweden) were employed. Structural Analyses of the Arabidopsis ANTR1 Protein—Analysis of the 512-amino acid sequence of the ANTR1 protein from Arabidopsis (UniProtKB O82390) revealed the presence of a putative chloroplast transit peptide (TargetP score 0.99) with a cleavage site between amino acids 59–60 (Fig. 1A). The theoretical molecular masses for the full-length and processed forms are 56.5 and 50.7 kDa, respectively. ANTR2 is the closest homologue among the ANTRs, showing 70% sequence identity (80% similarity) to ANTR1 (data extracted from ARAMEMNON). Although both proteins have been localized to the chloroplast (13Roth C. Menzel G. Petetot J.M. Rochat-Hacker S. Poirier Y. Planta. 2004; 218: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the transit peptide is the least conserved region between them, implying a distinct intra-chloroplast location and/or import pathway. ANTR1 orthologues are present in other sequenced plant species such as rice (86%) and Popullus (88%) (data extracted from ARAMEMNON). No sequence homology was found to other known Pi transport systems from plant chloroplasts or E. coli. ANTR1 protein shows 30 and 36% sequence identity (50 and 60% similarity) to rabbit NaPi-1 and rat VGLUT2, respectively, thus belonging to the anion:cation symporter family, part of the major facilitator superfamily (PROSITE PS50850). ANTR1 contains the characteristic 7-residue motif conserved in all anion:cation symporter members (Fig. 1A). The topology of NaPi-I has never been addressed experimentally. The NaPi-I proteins are predicted to contain 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs) (9Werner A. Dehmelt L. Nalbant P. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 3135-3142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Reimer R.J. Edwards R.H. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and an extended hydrophilic loop between TMD VI and TMD VII, as in the characteristic 6 + 6 configuration of many major facilitator superfamily members. Prediction of ANTR1 topology at ARAMEMNON (18Schwacke R. Schneider A. van der Graaff E. Fischer K. Catoni E. Desimone M. Frommer W.B. Flügge U.I. Kunze R. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of 8–12 putative TMDs and an “in” (i.e. stroma) orientation for both the N and C termini. The most controversial hydrophobic regions (score < 0.4) correspond to TMD IV, TMD IX, and TMD X (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, another set of topology programs at PRODIV-TMHMM (19Viklund H. Elofsson A. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1908-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) indicated the presence of 12 putative TMDs. The most plausible reason for the large variability between various tested software is the presence of a significant number of charged residues as well as prolines and glycines within the putative TMDs, as in the case of the thylakoid ATP/ADP carrier (6Thuswaldner S. Lagerstedt J.O. Rojas-Stütz M. Bouhidel K. Der C. Leborgne-Castel N. Mishra A. Marty F. Schoefs B. Adamska I. Persson B.L. Spetea C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8848-8859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A 12-TMD topology was resolved in the crystal structure of four different major facilitator superfamily proteins (21Lemieux M.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2007; 24: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Assuming that members of the same superfamily of transporters have a similar structure regardless of the type of substrate, we propose a 12-TMD model for ANTR1 in the thylakoid membrane in which both the termini and the long central loop (46 residues) connecting the two six-helix halves are exposed to the stromal side of the membrane (Fig. 1B). A 5-residue consensus sequence has been proposed for various Na+-dependent transport systems (22Deguchi Y. Yamato I. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21704-21708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is consistent with G342/A381X4LX3PR391 in rabbit NaPi-1 (23Werner A. Moore M.L. Mantei N. Biber J. Semenza G. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9608-9612Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and also present in rat VGLUT2 (Fig. 1C). This consensus sequence was found partially conserved in ANTR1, i.e. the leucine (non-polar) residue is changed for a glutamine (polar but uncharged) residue (Fig. 1C). Nevertheless, despite this non-conservative change the Na+ dependence of ANTR1 transport activity has been validated experimentally as described below. Expression and Localization of the ANTR1 Protein in Arabidopsis—Western blot analysis of total protein extracts from various Arabidopsis tissues was performed using an ANTR1-specific antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”). A single cross-reacting band with Mr of 45 was detected and corresponds to a protein mainly expressed in photosynthetic tissues (e.g. mature leaves and flower buds), less in senescent leaves, and absent in roots (Fig. 2A), in line with microarray expression data available at Genevestigator® data base (24Zimermann P. Hennig L. Gruissem W. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 407-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The predicted chloroplast location of ANTR1 was experimentally confirmed using transient expression of a green fluorescent protein fusion construct (13Roth C. Menzel G. Petetot J.M. Rochat-Hacker S. Poirier Y. Planta. 2004; 218: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but not precisely assigned to any of the chloroplast membrane compartments. In this study, chloroplasts isolated from Arabidopsis leaves as well as thylakoid and envelope membrane subfractions, purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (6Thuswaldner S. Lagerstedt J.O. Rojas-Stütz M. Bouhidel K. Der C. Leborgne-Castel N. Mishra A. Marty F. Schoefs B. Adamska I. Persson B.L. Spetea C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8848-8859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-ANTR1 antibody. The 45-kDa protein band was detected in chloroplasts, enriched in the thylakoid subfraction, but not found in the envelope (Fig. 2B, upper panel). No cross-reacting products were detected when the corresponding rabbit preimmune serum was used (Fig. 2, A and B, upper panel), supporting the specificity of the anti-ANTR1 antibody. The 45-kDa thylakoid protein is indicated as the ANTR1 protein. Control experiments using antibodies for envelope (TIC110) and thylakoid (LHCII) markers verified the high purity of the tested fractions (Fig. 2B, lower panel). When using another antibody raised against a common peptide for ANTR1 and ANTR2 (see “Experimental Procedures”), two distinct cross-reacting protein bands with similar Mr of ∼45 were detected in the chloroplast membrane subfractions. The upper band corresponds to the thylakoid protein, also detected with the ANTR1-specific antibody (Fig. 1C). The lower band was detected exclusively in the envelope and corresponds most likely to ANTR2, in line with previous observations (13Roth C. Menzel G. Petetot J.M. Rochat-Hacker S. Poirier Y. Planta. 2004; 218: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Expression and Functional Characterization of ANTR1 in E. coli Cells—Pi transporter mutants of yeast are widely used for functional analysis of plant Pi transporters. However, previous work (13Roth C. Menzel G. Petetot J.M. Rochat-Hacker S. Poirier Y. Planta. 2004; 218: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and our own attempts showed that, although expressed, the ANTR1 protein was inactive with respect to anion transport. Instead, the bacterial system has proven successful for functional characterization of another thylakoid transporter (6Thuswaldner S. Lagerstedt J.O. Rojas-Stütz M. Bouhidel K. Der C. Leborgne-Castel N. Mishra A. Marty F. Schoefs B. Adamska I. Persson B.L. Spetea C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8848-8859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as well as of a prokaryotic Na+-dependent Pi transporter (25Lebens M. Lundquist P. Söderlund L. Todorovic M. Carlin N.I. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4466-4474Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, here we have expressed the full-length ANTR1 protein and studied its functional properties in E. coli cells as a recombinant His6-Xpress-ANTR1-FLAG fusion construct (Fig. 3A). A cross-reacting band with Mr of 56 was detected using the anti-FLAG antibody in the IPTG-induced transformed (EANTR1), but not in control, cells (Fig. 3B). The 56-kDa protein band was readily detected after 2 h of induction, and its level remained constant for up to 6–8 h. It corresponds to a membrane protein, as revealed by subcellular fractionation (data not shown). The 56-kDa protein was also immunodetected by the anti-ANTR1 antibodies as well as by the Xpress peptide antibody (data not shown). The preserved N terminus harboring the Xpress tag (Fig. 3A) and the size of 56 kDa for the recombinant full-length protein indicate that the E. coli system is unable to process the transit peptide (see Fig. 1A). During 8 h of IPTG induction in TB-Pi medium, the EANTR1 cells grew considerably faster than the control cells (Fig. 3C), suggesting an advantage conferred by the activity of the heterologously expressed Arabidopsis protein. Arabidopsis ANTR1 renders the transformed strain able to take up the highest levels of Pi in the presence of NaCl, whereas a 2- to 3-fold reduction in the uptake activity was determined in the absence of NaCl (Fig. 4A). Pi uptake in control cells both in the absence and presence of NaCl yielded ∼20% of the maximal level of accumulated Pi in the EANTR1 cells. The uptake activity of EANTR1 cells in the absence of NaCl was only slightly higher than that of control cells under the same conditions, a phenomenon probably due to presence of trace amounts of NaCl in the cell suspension. The specificity for Na+versus Cl– was verified by the 10-fold reduction in transport activity when NaCl was replaced by choline hydrochloride in the assay reactions (Fig. 4B). Preincubation with a Na+ ionophore, monensin, reduced the Pi accumulation into the EANTR1 cells in the presence of NaCl to the level observed in control cells (data not shown), most likely due to its inability to inhibit the intrinsic H+-coupled Pi transport of E. coli (Ref. 15Harris R.M. Webb D.C. Howitt S.M. Cox G.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5008-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar and references therein). Taken together, these data indicate that, in contrast to the bacterial systems, ANTR1 can efficiently utilize the Na+ gradient created across cytoplasmic membrane for Pi uptake, in line with the presence in ANTR1 of the consensus sequence for Na+-dependent transport systems (Fig. 1C). The induced expression of the cloned ANTR1 gene by the addition of IPTG does not appear to repress the expression of other host-encoded Pi uptake mechanisms that result in the activity in the uptake of Pi in non-induced cells. In the non-induced EANTR1 cells the activity was low and Na+-independent (data not shown). After induction, the Na+-dependent component was dramatically increased and showed saturation behavior, suggesting an induction of ANTR1 activity in addition to that of bacterial-encoded Na+-independent Pi uptake systems. These observations suggest the advantage conferred by the ANTR1 (in the background of bacterial-derived activity) in taking up more Pi inaNa+-dependent transport mechanism (see Figs. 3C and 4A). In all the forthcoming experiments, the transport activity of ANTR1 was characterized by subtracting the values in EANTR1 cells by those for the control strain. Next, we investigated the sensitivity of ANTR1 transport activity to pH in the presence or absence of NaCl. The activity of ANTR1 in the absence of added NaCl was low, in the pH range 5.5 to 7.5, although 3-fold higher at pH 5.5 than at 6.5, and gradually increased with increasing pH only in the presence of NaCl (Fig. 4C). Thus, at pH 6.5 the activity was 15-fold higher than that observed at pH 5.5 and only 2-fold further increased at pH 7.5. A severe reduction was observed in the uptake at pH 8.5 (by 60%) as compared with 7.5, as also reported for the mammalian Na+-dependent Pit transporters (26Böttger P. Hede S.E. Grunnet M. Hoyer B. Klaerke D.A. Pedersen L. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C1377-C1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The activity in control cells was at its optimum at pH 5.5 and showed no stimulation by the addition of NaCl (data not shown). Increased Pi transport by ANTR1 and the stimulation by NaCl at higher pH may be explained as follows. At pH below 6.0 most Pi is present as H2PO –4 and the transport does not seem to require Na+ ions. The activity increases dramatically with pH when the HPO 2–4 species becomes dominant and requires the presence of Na+ ions. Among the alkali ions tested, maximum (15-fold) stimulation of Pi uptake by ANTR1 at pH 6.5 was achieved with Na+ followed by K+ (5-fold) (Fig. 4D). On the other hand, Li+ rather inhibited the uptake in E. coli, most likely due to indirect effects on bacterial metabolism. The ANTR1 contribution to the Pi accumulation in the EANTR1 strain showed a NaCl concentration dependence in the range of 0 to 5 mm, with a maximal (saturation) level at 15 to 25 mm (Fig. 5A). The level of Pi uptake in control cells was virtually not changed under these conditions, and at higher NaCl concentrations (50 mm) Pi uptake was inhibited in both strains (data not shown). The apparent Km and Vmax with respect to Na+ were 1.17 ± 0.36 mm and 99.15 ± 5.17 nmol mg–1 protein h–1, respectively. Next, we have studied the effect of Pi concentration on the 32P-labeled uptake in transformed and control cells under inducing conditions. The Pi concentration dependence showed a hyperbolic behavior (Fig. 5B) with an apparent Km of 78.7 ± 34 μm and a Vmax of 161 ± 28 nmol mg–1 protein h–1, values that define ANTR1 as a high affinity Pi transporter. To investigate whether ANTR1 specifically transports Pi and/or other anions, we measured the effect of various nonlabeled effectors on the Pi uptake in EANTR1 and control cells (Table 1).

CagA is thought to be necessary and sufficient to induce the motogenic response observed in response to CagA+ strains, as CagA interacts with proteins involved in adhesion and motility. We report that H. pylori strain 60190 stimulated AGS cell motility through a CagA- and TFSS-dependent mechanism, because strains 60190ΔcagA or 60190ΔcagE (TFSS-defective) did not increase motility. The JNK pathway is critical for H. pylori-dependent cell motility, as inhibition using SP600125 (JNK1/2/3 inhibitor) or a JNK2/3-specific inhibitor blocked motility. JNK mediates H. pylori-induced cell motility by activating paxillin, because JNK inhibition blocked paxillinTyr-118 phosphorylation, and paxillin expression knockdown completely abrogated bacteria-induced motility. Furthermore, JNK and paxillinTyr-118 were activated by 60190ΔcagA but not 60190ΔcagE, demonstrating CagA-independent signaling critical for cell motility. A β1 integrin-blocking antibody significantly inhibited JNK and paxillinTyr-118 phosphorylation and cell scattering, demonstrating that CagA-independent signaling required for cell motility occurs through β1. The requirement of both Src and focal adhesion kinase for signaling and motility further suggests the importance of integrin signaling in H. pylori-induced cell motility. Finally, we show that JNK activation occurs independent of known upstream kinases and signaling molecules, including Nod1, Cdc42, Rac1, MKK4, and MKK7, which demonstrates novel signaling leading to JNK activation.

Helicobacter pylori infects one-half of the world's population, establishing a chronic infection in the gastric mucosa that persists for the lifetime of the host (1Montecucco C. Rappuoli R. Nat. Rev.

Although most infections only manifest as superficial gastritis, many progress to mucosal necrosis, ulceration, and atrophic gastritis, a precursor lesion of gastric adenocarcinoma (3Peek Jr., R.M.

Additionally, H. pylori stimulates gastric cancer cell invasion through in vitro basement membranes, suggesting a role for H. pylori in cancer progression to metastasis (22Oliveira M.J. Costa A.C.

The mechanism of H. pylori-induced cell motility and invasion are unclear, although recent studies show that CagA associates with key regulators of cell adhesion, motility, and invasion, including c-Met, Grb2, SHP-2 phosphatase, and ZO-1 (11Higashi H.

Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) who showed that CagA transfection of AGS cells was sufficient to induce the motile phenotype. These data suggest that CagA stimulates all signaling necessary to induce cell motility, although this hypothesis is not universally accepted (22Oliveira M.J. Costa A.C. Costa A.M. Henriques L.

In this study, we identified JNK as a key mediator of H. pylori-stimulated cell motility, and we found that JNK was activated through a CagA-independent but still TFSS-dependent mechanism. We then evaluated the molecular mechanism of CagA-independent JNK activation, and we determined that CagA-independent activation of JNK occurs through β1 integrin and Src signaling. Furthermore, we identified paxillin as a downstream target of H. pylori-dependent JNK activation and that paxillin activity is required for H. pylori-stimulated gastric cancer cell motility. These data show for the first time a mechanism of CagA-independent signaling that promotes cell motility, and we conclude that a combination of CagA-dependent and CagA-independent cell signaling is required for H. pylori-induced gastric cancer cell motility. Cell Culture and Reagents—AGS gastric adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Ham's F-12 media (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gemini, West Sacramento, CA), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), and 0.0375% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were cultured to 75% confluency and split either 1:5 or 1:10 using 0.025% EDTA to gently detach cells from plastic. To prevent spontaneous cell scattering associated with increased passage number, fresh stocks were thawed out monthly. Pharmacological inhibitors LY294002, SP600125, JNK2/3 inhibitor (IX), and Bay11-7082 were obtained from EMD Biosciences (San Diego). Cycloheximide and PP2 were obtained from Sigma. The β1 blocking antibody AIIB2 was obtained from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). Prior to experiments, subtoxic concentrations of each inhibitor were selected, and Western blots to detect phosphorylated proteins were performed to confirm the functionality of the inhibitors at the concentrations used. For experiments, cells were pretreated with inhibitors for 30 min (LY294002, 50 μm; SP600125, 40 μm; cycloheximide, 10 μg/ml), 2 h (inhibitor IX, 625 nm), 2 h (PP2, 25 μm), or 3 h (Bay11-7082, 0.5 μg/ml) prior to the addition of bacteria. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—H. pylori strains 60190 (ATCC 49503, cag PAI+, vacA s1/m1) and Tx30a (ATCC 51932, cag PAI-, vacA s2/m2) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented with 5% adult defibrinated bovine blood (Gemini, West Sacramento, CA) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 overnight prior to use in experiments. H. pylori mutant strains with disrupted cagA (60190ΔcagA), cagE (60190ΔcagE), and vacA (60190ΔvacA) genes were a kind gift from Dr. Richard Peek (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). These strains were grown on the same plates as wild-type bacteria but under kanamycin selection (50 μg/ml). Bacteria were passaged daily, and fresh bacteria were thawed on a monthly basis. The H. pylori strain G27 was used in this study, and isogenic mutants, cagA and cagM, were constructed by natural transformation of a kanamycin cassette flanked by regions homologous to the disrupted genes (26Covacci A.

H. pylori G27 and mutant strains were routinely cultured on horse blood agar (blood base agar number 2, 8% (v/v) horse blood (Bio-Lab, Victoria, Australia)) supplemented with antibiotics (27Viala J. Chaput C. Boneca I.G. Cardona A. Girardin S.E. Moran A.P. Athman R. Memet S. Huerre M.R. Coyle A.J. DiStefano P.S. Sansonetti P.J. Labigne A. Bertin J. Philpott D.J. Ferrero R.L. Nat.

Bacteria were grown at 37 °C for 1–2 days under microaerobic conditions in an anaerobic jar containing a Campygen gas mix of 5% O2, 10% CO2, and 85% N2 (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK). Liquid broth cultures were incubated in 25-cm3 tissue culture flasks (Iwaki, Japan) in a final volume of 10 ml of brain heart infusion broth containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Thermo Electron, Melbourne, Australia) and with shaking at 125 rpm and 37 °C overnight, prior to use in experiments. H. pylori isogenic mutants with disrupted cagA (G27ΔcagA) and cagM (G27ΔcagM) were grown on the same plates as wild-type bacteria but under kanamycin selection (20 μg/ml). Infection of AGS Cells—At least 1 day prior to infection, AGS cells were seeded at a density of 2.5–6 × 104 cells/ml in antibiotic-free media. For each experiment, 1 day-old bacteria were suspended in warmed, CO2-charged antibiotic-free media, and bacterial density was measured by spectrophotometer at 600 nm. Bacteria were then added to cells at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 100. Bacterial contact with cells was synchronized by centrifugation at 600 × g for 4 min, after which cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 throughout each experiment. Control cells were prepared under identical conditions. Scatter Assays—Cells were cultured alone or with bacteria ± inhibitors for 18–20 h, and monolayers were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After three washes with PBS, F-actin was fluorescently labeled with Oregon Green 488 phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) suspended in BSP (bovine serum albumin, saponin, PBS). Fluorescent and phase images were acquired by wide field fluorescent microscopy. Western Blot Analysis—Lysates from bacteria alone or cells co-cultured with bacteria were collected in boiling protein loading buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.13 mm bromphenol blue, 1 m sucrose). Proteins were separated by 7.5–12% acrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pall, Pensacola, FL). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk or 0.1% gelatin in TBST (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) and incubated overnight with antibodies specific for tubulin (Neo-Markers, Fremont, CA), CagA (Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA), β-actin (Sigma), Rac1 (BD Biosciences), phospho-JNK, phospho-AKT, JNK, Cdc42, phospho-MKK4, MKK4, phospho-MKK7, MKK7, phospho-paxillinTyr-118, and paxillin (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and phospho-paxillinSer-178 (EMD Biosciences, San Diego) in 5% bovine serum albumin or 0.1% gelatin in TBST. Blots were followed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), and proteins were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Colloidal Gold Motility Assay—Assay was derived from colloidal gold phagokinetic assay as described previously (28Scott W.N. McCool K. Nelson J. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 343-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, 12-mm coverslips were immersed in a gelatin solution (Sigma, 300 bloom; 500 mg in 300 ml of water) and heated at 90 °C for 10 min. The gelatin was then removed, and the coverslips were dried at 70 °C for 45 min. After the coverslips cooled, they were aseptically transferred to 24-well plates. The colloidal gold suspension was prepared by mixing 11 ml of water, 6 ml of a 36.5 mm Na2CO3 solution, and 2 ml of a 14.5 mm AuHCl4 solution (Fisher). The mixture was gently swirled high over a Bunsen burner until the first sign of boiling, after which the flask was immediately removed from heat, and 2 ml of a 0.1% formaldehyde solution was quickly added. The hot solution was allowed to slightly cool on the bench top as the flask was swirled, during which time the solution turned moderately brown in color. After the gold solution changed color, 2 ml were added atop each coverslip in the 24-well plate, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 h to allow the gold particles to settle onto the coverslips. Coverslips were then gently washed and stored in PBS at 4 °C until use. For motility assays, 1 × 104 cells were seeded onto prepared coverslips and spun at 600 × g to maximize cell attachment to the substratum. 4J. L. Snider, personal observations. After 6–12 h of recovery time, bacteria were added as described above. In inhibition assays, the inhibitors were added 30 min prior to the addition of bacteria, except for SU11274, which was added overnight following a 6-h recovery period. After 18–22 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with BSP for 1 h at room temperature without agitation. Coverslips were rinsed three times with PBS and mounted onto slides with Slowfade Gold antifade reagent with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Phase and fluorescent images were taken of each field, and the area was cleared by single or small colonies of cells measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). The area was then divided by the number of nuclei in the corresponding fluorescent image to give the average area cleared per cell. Fifteen to 30 fields were visualized in this manner for an average of 100 cells per coverslip, and between one and three coverslips were used per experimental condition. Data for two to three separate experiments were compared and presented as the fold change over control or area cleared per cell. Standard deviation and error were included, and p values were calculated by either the paired two-sample t test for means (Microsoft Excel) or analysis of variance with Tukey's HSD test (GraphPad Prism). Short Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—Transfection protocol was modified from Chan et al. (29Chan A.Y. Coniglio S.J. Chuang Y.Y. Michaelson D. Knaus U.G. Philips M.R. Symons M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7821-7829Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.25 × 104 AGS cells were seeded into a 24-well plate, and the following day were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to product protocol using 1.5 μl of stock Cdc42 or luciferase siRNA (20 μm; a kind gift from Dr. Marc Symons, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY). After 2 days fresh medium was added, and cells were either infected with H. pylori for scatter assays or collected for Western blot analysis. Lentiviral Delivery of Short Hairpin (sh) RNA—Stable shRNA cell lines were generated using MISSION shRNA lentiviruses (Sigma) according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 × 104 AGS cells were seeded in 6-well dishes, and each well was left untreated or infected with one of the five lentiviral clones provided in each target transcript kit (m.o.i. of 0.5) plus Polybrene (8 μg/ml). The following day, virus was aspirated and replaced with fresh media, and the next day the cells were washed, and media containing puromycin (0.6 μg/ml) was added for selection of stable transfectants. After 3 days of daily washes, stable clones were screened for maximal target protein expression knockdown. The clones selected were as follows: Rac1 (MISSION shRNA TRCN0000004873), MKK4 (MISSION shRNA TRCN0000039916), MKK7 (MISSION shRNA TRCN0000000587), paxillin (MISSION shRNA TRCN-0000123138), and non-target control (MISSION shRNA SHC002V). Stable GFP shRNA cell lines were generated by infecting AGS cells with the lentiviral shRNA vector GFP-FSIPPW (a kind gift from Dr. Andrew Kung, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). Stable cells were cultured in puromycin-containing media. Adenovirus Infection—Transient expression of GFP-tagged FAK-related non-kinase (Ad-GFP-FRNK) or GFP (Ad-GFP) was facilitated through adenoviral delivery. Ad-GFP-FRNK and Ad-GFP viruses were a kind gift of Dr. Joan Taylor (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). AGS cells were incubated overnight with virus at an m.o.i. of 10. The following day, cells were then infected with H. pylori strains for either 1 h (Western blot analysis) or overnight. After overnight incubation, cells were fixed and stained for F-actin using Alexa Fluor 546 phalloidin (Molecular Probes). GFP and Texas Red images were captured, and merge images were generated using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Nod1KD Cell Analysis—AGS cells stably expressing siRNAs to either the caspase-activation recruitment domain of Nod1 or an irrelevant gene (EGFP) were generated by Dr. J. Viala (Institut Pasteur, Paris) (27Viala J. Chaput C. Boneca I.G. Cardona A. Girardin S.E. Moran A.P. Athman R. Memet S. Huerre M.R. Coyle A.J. DiStefano P.S. Sansonetti P.J. Labigne A. Bertin J. Philpott D.J. Ferrero R.L. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1166-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Briefly, AGS cells were transfected with plasmid constructs in which short hairpin RNA to the genes of interest had been cloned into psiRNA-hHIneo (InvivoGen, San Diego). To select for clones that had stably incorporated the respective plasmids into their genomic DNA, the cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). G418-resistant cells were isolated and expanded so as to generate stable knockdown clones for NOD1 or EGFP genes. The characterization of these clones will be described in detail elsewhere. 5R. L. Ferrero, unpublished data. Successful knockdown of Nod1 expression in these cells was published previously (30Kufer T.A. Kremmer E. Adam A.C. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J. Cell. Microbiol. 2007; 10: 477-486PubMed Google Scholar). Chemokine Analysis—IL-8 production by EGFP and Nod1KD cells induced by H. pylori co-culture was determined by collecting 24-h supernatants and using the OptEIA kit (BD Biosciences). H. pylori-dependent AGS Cell Scattering and Motility Require CagA and the TFSS—Epithelial cell lines co-cultured with Cag PAI+ H. pylori strains exhibit the hummingbird phenotype associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (14Churin Y.

To demonstrate that a similar phenotype occurred in response to exposure to H. pylori in our experimental system, AGS gastric cancer cells were co-cultured with H. pylori 60190 (Cag PAI+, vacuolating) or Tx30a (Cag PAI-, nonvacuolating) for 18 h, and cells were fixed and fluorescently labeled for F-actin. As shown in Fig. 1A, panel ii, AGS cells cultured with H. pylori 60190 exhibited the hummingbird phenotype indicative of motile cells, whereas cells cultured with H. pylori Tx30a (Fig. 1A, panel iii) showed no morphological changes compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1A, panel i). To determine the bacterial factors required for AGS cell scattering, isogenic mutants of H. pylori 60190 with gene disruptions in cagA (60190ΔcagA), cagE, encoding a gene product required for full TFSS functionality (60190ΔcagE) or vacA (60190ΔvacA) were used in co-culture assays. Western blot analysis was first performed on whole bacteria lysates to confirm that the mutant strains 60190ΔcagE and 60190ΔvacA, but not 60190ΔcagA, expressed CagA (Fig. 1B). AGS cells were then co-cultured with each of these strains, and the extent of cell scattering was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1A, panels iv and v, 60190ΔcagA and 60190ΔcagE, respectively, did not induce wild-type cell scattering, demonstrating that the delivery of CagA into host cells is necessary to induce the hummingbird phenotype. The mutant strain 60190ΔvacA caused a scattering phenotype similar to wild-type 60190 (Fig. 1A, panels vi and ii, respectively), demonstrating that the vacuolating cytotoxin of H. pylori plays no role in the induction of this morphological response. Previous studies have measured H. pylori-induced cell motility as the percent of cells per field that exhibit the hummingbird phenotype (21Higashi H. Nakaya A. Tsutsumi R. Yokoyama K. Fujii Y.

To quantitate the level of participation of bacterial and host proteins in cell motility, a modified colloidal gold phagokinetic assay was utilized to investigate the role of CagA, the TFSS itself (using the CagE mutant), and the vacuolating cytotoxin in cell motility. Briefly, cells and bacteria were seeded onto a colloidal gold substrate, and cell motility was measured as a function of the area that cells cleared as they moved during the assay. As shown in Fig. 1C, H. pylori 60190 stimulated a 2-fold increase in cell motility over untreated cells. Additionally, only the VacA mutant caused a comparable increase in motility over untreated cells, although no significant increase in motility was observed by Tx30a and the CagA or TFSS mutants. These data correlate with our scatter data from Fig. 1A and demonstrate that cell motility is a CagA- and TFSS-dependent but VacA-independent event.

Here we describe a series of high-resolution structures of the RNase PH ring from the Pyrococcus abyssi exosome, one of them containing three 10-mer RNA strands within the exosome catalytic chamber, and report additional nucleotide interactions involving positions N5 and N7.

In combination with RNA degradation assays performed with mutants of key amino acid residues, the structural data presented here provide support for a model of exosome-mediated RNA degradation that integrates the events involving catalytic cleavage, product elimination, and RNA translocation.

The archaeal exosome consists of two RNase PH subunits (Rrp41 and Rrp42) and two proteins containing the S1/KH (Rrp4) or S1/zinc ribbon (Csl4) RNA-binding domains (17Evguenieva-Hackenberg E.

Determination of the three-dimensional structure of the Sulfolobus solfataricus and Archaeoglobus fulgidus exosomes revealed a PNPase-like fold (20Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (222) Google Scholar), composed by alternating RNase PH subunits assembled into a hexameric ring capped by a trimer of RNA-binding proteins, which can be formed by either Rrp4 or Csl4 or possibly by a mixture of both (19Büttner K.

EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Such an architecture encloses the exoribonucleolytic active sites at the bottom of the RNase PH ring catalytic chamber and restricts the entry to only unstructured RNA through the S1 pore, formed by the RNA-binding subunits of the exosome cap placed at the top of the ring (19Büttner K.

Both Rrp41 and Rrp42 subunits possess the same RNase PH-fold and are involved in substrate binding, but the amino acid residues contributing to the interactions with the phosphate nucleophile at the 3′ end of the RNA are located exclusively within the Rrp41 subunit (21Lorentzen E. Walter P. Fribourg S. Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Klug G. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Compared with archaeal exosomes, the eukaryotic exosome displays a more diverse subunit composition: the PNPase-like core is composed of six different RNase PH subunits regarded as Rrp41-like (Rrp41, Rrp46, and Mtr3) or Rrp42-like (Rrp42, Rrp43, and Rrp45) according to sequence homology, and three putative RNA-binding proteins (Rrp4, Rrp40, and Csl4) (21Lorentzen E. Walter P. Fribourg S. Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Klug G. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Differently from its archaeal counterpart, the yeast exosome presents two additional hydrolytic exoribonucleases, Rrp44 (also known as Dis3) and Rrp6, which share similarities with the bacterial RNase II and RNase D, respectively (1Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 24Cheng Z. Deutscher M. Mol.

The structure of the human exosome PNPase-like core reported recently revealed an architecture very similar to the archaeal complex (26Liu Q. Greimann J. Lima C. Cell. 2006; 127: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Although phosphorolytic activity has been observed for some isolated subunits of the eukaryotic exosome (1Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 27Jiang T. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5295-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and for the human heterodimer Rrp41/Rrp45 (26Liu Q. Greimann J. Lima C. Cell. 2006; 127: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), recent studies have shown that only the hydrolytic exoribonucleases are active in the context of the eukaryotic complex (28Dziembowski A. Lorentzen E. Conti E. Séraphin B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 29Liu Q. Greimann J. Lima C. Cell. 2007; 131: 188-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although this loss of phosphorolytic activity may be related to a reduction in the selection pressure compensated by the presence of additional hydrolytic subunits (30Wahle E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the eukaryotic exosome PNPase-core may on the other hand have assumed a role as scaffold for interaction with the proteins assisting its various activities (28Dziembowski A. Lorentzen E. Conti E. Séraphin B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Independently of the evolutionary and functional reasons for the conservation of the eukaryotic exosome PNPase-like core, its lack of phosphate-dependent activity was not understood at the molecular level so far, especially taking into account that at least one eukaryotic Rrp41/Rrp42-like heterodimer (human Rrp41/Rrp45) possesses an intact archaeal-like phosphorolytic active site (21Lorentzen E. Walter P. Fribourg S. Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Klug G. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Despite the valuable information already available on the archaeal exosome, some key questions on the catalytic mechanism remain to be addressed, particularly regarding how the RNA is progressively processed, how the free nucleoside diphosphate is released, and concerning the relevance of the archaeal exosome quaternary organization. In this work, we report four x-ray structures of Pyrococcus abyssi Rrp41-Rrp42 complexes: two “native” structures at 2.14- and 2.40-Å resolution, which revealed nonspecific nucleotides bound to the RNA cleft; a 10-mer poly(A) RNA complex at 1.94-Å resolution and a CDP complex at 2.30-Å resolution. Together with RNA degradation assays, these structures give new insights into the archaeal exosome RNA processing mechanism. Furthermore, structural comparisons with the human exosome provided a possible explanation for the absence of phosphorolytic activity by the eukaryotic complex. P. abyssi Rrp41-Rrp42 Complex Production and Purification—Escherichia coli vectors pET29-Rrp4, pET29-Rrp41, and pAE-Rrp42 expressing the P. abyssi Rrp4 and the exosome RNase PH core proteins Rrp41 and Rrp42, respectively, were constructed in previous work. 4C. R. R. Ramos and C. C. Oliveira, unpublished data. Histidine-tagged Rrp41 was co-expressed with Rrp42 in E. coli and purified as described for homologues from P. horikoshi (18Ramos C.R.R. Oliveira C.L.P. Torriani I.L. Oliveira C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6751-6759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, after bacterial cell disruption by sonication, the lysate was heated at 80 °C for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The Rrp41-Rrp42 complex was purified by affinity chromatography, via binding of the histidine-tagged Rrp41 to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen), followed by Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion chromatography. Fractions from the size exclusion chromatography presenting a hydrodynamic radius compatible with the hexameric RNase PH ring, as determined by dynamic light scattering, were pooled, concentrated, and used in crystallization trials (supplemental Fig. S1). For assembly of the nine subunits complex, Rrp4 was expressed in E. coli BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL and purified by anion exchange chromatography (HiTrap Q, GE Healthcare) based on previously described protocols (18Ramos C.R.R. Oliveira C.L.P. Torriani I.L. Oliveira C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6751-6759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The purified RNase PH ring was then mixed with a 3-fold excess of Rrp4 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the mixture was fractionated on a Superdex 75 column to remove excess Rrp4 from the reconstituted Rrp4-exosome, which was eluted as a single peak. Crystallization and Data Collection—Single crystals of the Rrp41-Rrp42 complex were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C by mixing 2 μl of protein solution (14.2 mg ml-1 in 0.15 m phosphate-buffered saline) with 2 μl of reservoir solution. Plate-like crystals of ∼600 × 400 × 20 μm3 grew over 3 days, using 0.1 m BisTris, 3The abbreviation used is: BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. pH 6.0, 45% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and 0.1 m LiCl as the precipitant solution. Diffraction intensities were collected at 100 K using a MarCCD 165-mm detector at the D03B-MX1 beam line of the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS, Campinas, Brazil). Data sets were indexed and scaled using XDS (31Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). Complete data sets from two Rrp41-Rrp42 native crystals were collected to maximum resolutions of 2.14 and 2.30 Å, respectively. Crystals of the P. abyssi exosome RNase PH ring were also soaked into solutions composed of mother liquor containing 20 mm CDP or 14 mm RNA 10-mer poly(A) for 2 and 16 h, respectively. Complete data sets of these crystals were collected up to a resolution of 1.94 and 2.40 Å, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of the P. abyssi exosome RNase PH ring was solved by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP (32Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4098) Google Scholar) of the CCP4 suite (33Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Atomic coordinates of the A. fulgidus Rrp41-Rrp42 heterodimer (PDB entry 2BA0) were used as the search model. A. fulgidus Rrp41 and Rrp42 share sequence identities of 55.4 and 49.8% with P. abyssi Rrp41 and Rrp42, respectively. Molecular replacement solution was subjected to interactive rounds of manual rebuilding into the 2|Fo | - |Fc| and |Fo| - |Fc| electron density maps using COOT (34Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar) and refinement was carried out using simulated annealing, conjugate gradient minimization and temperature factor protocols available in CNS (35Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewisk J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Final rounds of refinement were performed with REFMAC (36Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) applying TLS group restrains (37Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) for each subunit within the asymmetric unit. During the refinement procedure, strong extra densities were observed in the Fourier electron difference map |Fo| - |Fc| in regions compatible with nucleotide binding sites. The identities and occupancy of the modeled ligands were determined based on the analysis of B-factors and the resulting electron density maps. The structures determined from crystals soaked into 10-mer poly(A) RNA and CDP were refined using the native P. abyssi structure as the starting model. After an initial cycle of rigid body refinement, the structures were subjected to restrained refinement performed with REFMAC, applying TLS group restrains, as described for the first structure. The ligand molecules (UDP/GMP and ADP in the native structures and CDP and 10-mer poly(A) RNA in the ligand soaked structures) were modeled into the electron density maps using COOT. For all structures, water molecules were automatically introduced by the program wARP (38Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Details of the refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. Mutagenesis and Activity Assays—Four point mutations (R137A, D180A, D186A, and D204A) and a double mutation (R89E/K91E) were introduced in Rrp41 and a point mutation (K45A) was introduced in Rrp42 using standard site-directed mutagenesis protocols. The reconstituted mutant exosome variants were purified following the same protocol established for the wild-type form. RNA degradation assays were performed at 60 °C in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaPO4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.8 units of RNasin, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), containing 10 nm 32P-5′-labeled 15-mer poly(rA) as substrate. Initially, different complex concentrations (10 nm to 1 μm) were incubated in the reaction mixture for 20 min to access complex activity. The time course assays presented in Figs. 2, b and c, and 5c were performed with complex concentrations of 100 nm. The reactions were resolved on 8% denaturing TBE-Urea polyacrylamide gels. Accession Codes—Protein data bank coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with accession codes 2PNZ, 2PO0, 2PO1, and 2PO2 for the P. abyssi exosome RNase PH ring bound to UDP/GMP, ADP, 10-mer poly(rA), and CDP, respectively. The subunits Rrp41 and Rrp42 of the P. abyssi exosome were co-expressed in E. coli and the purified complex was crystallized in the trigonal P321 space group. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the atomic coordinates of the A. fulgidus Rrp41-Rrp42 heterodimer as the search model (PDB code 2BA0). The first native structure was refined at 2.14-Å resolution to an Rfree of 25.5%, with good stereochemistry. The asymmetric unit contains one Rrp41-Rrp42 heterodimer and application of the crystallographic 3-fold axis reconstitutes the characteristic exosome RNase PH core, which is composed of a hexameric ring of alternating subunits (21Lorentzen E. Walter P. Fribourg S. Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Klug G. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). The overall structure of the P. abyssi exosome RNase PH ring is very similar to its archaeal counterparts from A. fulgidus and S. solfataricus (19Büttner K. Wenig K. Hopfner K.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 461-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Lorentzen E. Walter P. Fribourg S. Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Klug G. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Superposition of individual Rrp41 and Rrp42 subunits results in root mean square deviations ranging from 0.899 to 1.619 Å for the superimposed Cα atoms (supplemental Fig. S3 and supplemental Table S1). The high quality of the electron density maps allowed modeling of residues 9 to 244 from Rrp41 and residues 8 to 274 from Rrp42, without gaps in the polypeptide chains. During the refinement procedure, strong extra electron densities in the Fourier difference map |Fo| - |Fc| revealed the presence of nucleotides at the phosphorolytic active site and at an additional interaction site (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, structural comparison with the RNA-bound structure of S. solfataricus RNase PH ring (PDB code 2C38) revealed that the additional nucleotide binding site identified in the P. abyssi complex is adjacent to the fourth nucleotide within the exosome-specific RNA recognition cleft, which is formed at the interface of the Rrp41-Rrp42 subunits (23Lorentzen E. Conti E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Based on this finding, we assigned this additional nucleotide as N5, following the nomenclature introduced by Lorentzen and Conti (23Lorentzen E. Conti E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which defines N1 as the nucleotide of the RNA 3′ end that occupies the phosphorolytic active site. Given the unspecific nature of RNA recognition by the exosome, the electron densities observed at the N1 and N5 binding sites probably arose from a mixture of nucleotides copurified with the recombinant Rrp41-Rrp42 complex. In both cases the phosphate and ribose groups were clearly defined by the electron density maps, which allowed also modeling of an UDP and a GMP in the N1 and N5 sites, respectively. A second native P. abyssi RNase PH ring structure was solved and refined to a resolution of 2.30 Å and an Rfree of 24.2%. Similarly to the first structure, a strong electron density was observed close to the phosphorolytic active site during refinement, which allowed modeling of an ADP molecule (discussion in next sections). To obtain additional information on nucleoside diphosphate binding to the exosome phosphorolytic site, we also determined the structure from a crystal soaked into CDP. These crystals diffracted up to a resolution of 2.40 Å and the structure was refined to an Rfree of 25.8%. The electron density maps allowed us to unequivocally model a CDP molecule at the N1 binding site, mimicking an RNA phosphorolysis product (Fig. 1b). Finally, to better determine the RNA interactions with the exosome core and to confirm the presence of a N5 nucleotide binding site at the specific RNA recognition cleft, we solved the structure of the P. abyssi RNase PH ring in complex with a 10-mer poly(A) RNA. Binding of the 10-mer poly(A) RNA to the RNase PH ring was achieved by soaking native crystals with a 14 mm solution of the 10-mer poly(A). Because the crystals were grown in the absence of phosphate, phosphorolytic RNA cleavage was unlikely to happen. The 10-mer poly(A) RNA-soaked crystals diffracted to 1.94-Å resolution and the structure was refined to an Rfree of 23.6%. The RNA strand was found in the RNA recognition cleft, located at the interface of the Rrp41-Rrp42 heterodimer. Taking into account that the modeled nucleotides were refined with 100% occupancy and that, in the P. abyssi exosome crystals, the full structure is reconstituted by the crystallographic 3-fold axis, the RNA-bound structure indicates that the archaeal exosome RNase PH ring binds three RNA strands concomitantly. This result agrees with isothermal titration calorimetry analysis reported by Oddone and colleagues (39Oddone A. Lorentzen E. Basquin J. Gasch A. Rybin V. Conti E. Sattler M.

As in the case of the S. solfataricus RNase PH ring structure in complex with RNA (23Lorentzen E. Conti E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the contacts found in the RNA recognition cleft of the P. abyssi exosome ring described here are dominated by ionic interactions between the phosphate backbone of the four nucleotides of the RNA 3′ end and a ladder of arginine side chains from both Rrp41(1) and Rrp42(1) subunits (for clarity, the three heterodimers that form the quaternary structure of the archaeal exosome core are assigned as 1, 2, or 3 throughout the text and the residues and subunits belonging to them will be distinguished by these numbers in parentheses). However, the 10-mer poly(A) RNA-bound structure solved in this work showed a fifth nucleotide (N5) at the specific RNA recognition cleft, which had already been observed as a free nucleotide in the first native structure. Furthermore, the high resolution obtained for this complex revealed a more intricate network of RNA-exosome contacts, showing that subunits from the three heterodimers participate in RNA recognition (Fig. 2, a and b and supplemental Table S2). The phosphorolytic site of the P. abyssi exosome on the Rrp41(1) subunit is formed by two conserved arginines (Arg97 and Arg137) and by the catalytic residue Asp180, which interacts with the phosphate moiety of nucleotide N1. The ribose 3′ OH of N1 is hydrogen-bonded to the main chain of the conserved Ala134 and the inorganic phosphate binding site, comprised by the conserved residues Gly135, Thr136, and Arg137, is occupied by three water molecules (Fig. 2c). These water molecules are located in equivalent positions of the phosphate PB oxygen atoms modeled in the CDP-bound structure (Fig. 1b). The interaction proposed for the ribose 2′ OH of N1 with the carbonyl group of Ala134 of S. solfataricus Rrp41 (correspondent to P. abyssi Ala132) (23Lorentzen E. Conti E. Mol.

Instead, all the structures solved in this work showed a water-mediated interaction between the ribose 2′ OH of N1 and the conserved lysine Lys45 from the Rrp42(3) subunit, which is part of the neighbor heterodimer (Fig. 2c). On the other extreme of the exosome-specific RNA recognition cleft, the nucleotide N5 found in the P. abyssi RNase PH core structure breaks the pattern of base stacking interaction observed for the four innermost 3′ end nucleotides, pointing the RNA strand to the exosome central chamber and, most importan"

We investigated different roles for the two UbL domains in protein modification by ISG15 (ISGylation) and the impact of Influenza B virus NS1 protein (NS1B) on regulation of the pathway. The results show that, although the C-terminal domain is sufficient to link ISG15 to UBE1L and UbcH8, the N-terminal domain is dispensable in the activation and transthiolation steps but required for efficient E3-mediated transfer of ISG15 from UbcH8 to its substrates. NS1B specifically binds to the N-terminal domain of ISG15 but does not affect ISG15 linkage via a thioester bond to its activating and conjugating enzymes. However, it does inhibit the formation of cellular ISG15 conjugates upon interferon treatment. We propose that the N-terminal UbL domain of ISG15 mainly functions in the ligation step and NS1B inhibits ISGylation by competing with E3 ligases for binding to the N-terminal domain.

ISG15 protein belongs to the family of ubiquitin-like (UbL) modifiers whose members are capable of forming conjugates to cellular proteins (3Dao C.T. Zhang D.E. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 2701-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Similar to the ubiquitination pathway, the ISG15 modification or ISGylation process involves the concerted action of a set of enzymes: the activating (UBE1L), conjugating (UbcH8), and ligating enzymes (4Yuan W.

However, ISG15 is distinct from other members of the UbLs, such as SUMO and NEDD8 that contain one single UbL domain, in that it possesses two tandem UbL domains. Another two-UbL domain-containing protein, FAT10, can modify a very limited number of as-yet-unidentified proteins and has been associated with apoptosis (9Raasi S. Schmidtke G. Groettrup M. J. Biol.

In contrast, ISG15 in response to Type I IFN stimulation is potent in modifying a wide array of cellular proteins that have such diverse roles as RNA splicing, antiviral ability, cytoskeleton regulation, and signal transduction (7Wong J.J.

Recently, ISG15 has been shown to be a critical component in IFN-mediated inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 release (13Okumura A. Lu G. Pitha-Rowe I. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated to be a critical antiviral molecule against influenza, herpes, and Sindbis viruses (14Lenschow D.J. Giannakopoulos N.V. Gunn L.J. Johnston C. O'Guin A.K.

Given that ISG15 possesses the antiviral property, it is not surprising that the Influenza B virus has developed a strategy to block the ISG15 modification of cellular proteins through its nonstructural protein NS1 (NS1B) (4Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). To explore the respective roles of the two UbL domains of ISG15, we carried out a series of biochemical experiments to study their specific functions in ISGylation pathway as well as to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which NS1B inhibits ISG15 conjugation to cellular proteins. Generation of Expression Constructs and Protein Purification—The encoding sequences for UBE1L, NS1B-1-103, NS1B-1-90, NS1B-91-103, ISG15, and its two separate domains, ISG15N (residues 1-80) and ISG15C (82-157), were amplified via PCR and cloned in frame with GST into the pGEX-4T-3 expression vector using BamHI/XhoI cloning sites. The NS1B gene was synthesized via PCR by using the oligonucleotides. Those for NS1B and NS1B-1-145 were inserted into pET-22b+ expression vector using NdeI/XhoI cloning sites. UbcH8 was cloned into pET-32M expression vector. In addition, the FLAG sequences were inserted immediately upstream of ISG15 and ISG15C via PCR. The genes encoding for FLAG-ISG15, FLAG-ISG15N, and FLAG-ISG15C were also cloned into pET-32 M expression vector using BamHI/XhoI cloning sites. All of the proteins were purified from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells by affinity and gel filtration chromatographies. The ISG15 proteins have a mutation at Cys78 to Ser78 to avoid formation of nonspecific disulfides (16Narasimhan J. Wang M. Fu Z. Klein J.M. Haas A.L. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27356-27365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transfection, Western Blot, and Antibodies—The GB1 sequence was inserted at the N terminus of ISG15 and ISG15C and then subcloned into pCMV-Tag-3B expression vector. The gene coding for NS1B was cloned into pcDNA3-HA expression vector, whereas those genes encoding UBE1L and UbcH8 were inserted into pCMV-Tag-2B expression vector. Human HEK 293T and A549 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), penicillin, and streptomycin and grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HEK-293T cells were transfected with the above vectors by using standard calcium phosphate method. A549 cells were transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Four hours after transfection, the media were replaced with fresh media containing 1000 units/ml IFN-α 2a (Roche Applied Science), and the cells were cultured for another 48 h in the presence of IFN-α 2a (1000 units/ml). Forty-eight hours later, the cells were harvested and lysed in the lysis buffer. Western blotting was carried out by detection with anti-His (Invitrogen), anti-FLAG (Sigma), or anti-Myc (Cell Signaling) antibody when needed. The antibodies against endogenous ISG15 and actin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz). Analytical Gel Filtration Chromatography and GST Pull-down Assay—Protein samples were applied to an analytical Superose-12 HR column for chromatographic analysis. For characterizing the complex formation, NS1B-1-103 was mixed with full-length ISG15 or each of its two domains for 2 h before being loaded onto the above column. The elution volume of each fraction in the profile was obtained by recording the absorbance (A280) from the fast protein liquid chromatography facility. Purified GST or GST fusion proteins were incubated with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in an phosphate buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH7.3) for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with the incubation buffer and then incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with the proteins to be tested. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with the incubation buffer. The samples were made by adding loading buffer into the Eppendorf tube harboring the beads and then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie staining or Western blotting. NMR Spectroscopy—15N/13C-Labeled FLAG-ISG15 (∼1 mm) was dissolved in a buffer containing 20 mm phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.8. All of the heteronuclear spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Varian INOVA 600 spectrometer. Sequence-specific assignments for FLAG-ISG15 were performed by analyzing two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra and a set of three-dimensional spectra including HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, C(CO)NH, and H(CCO)NH. For NMR titration experiments, 15N-labeled FLAG-ISG15, FLAG-ISG15N, or FLAG-ISG15C at the molar concentration of 0.2 mm, was used to be titrated with NS1B and its fragments, and then the [1H,15N]HSQC spectra were acquired to monitor the peak intensity changes upon titration. In Vitro Conjugation Assay—ISG15 conjugation mixture (50μl) was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The reactions were stopped by the addition of loading buffer with or without dithiothreitol, and the reaction products were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting and visualized with ECL development reagent (Pierce). The C-terminal Domain of ISG15 Is Sufficient to Link to UBE1L and UbcH8 via Thiol Esterification—ISG15 comprises two UbL domains with the N-and C-terminal domains sharing 33 and 32% similarities with ubiquitin, respectively (Fig. 1A) (3Dao C.T. Zhang D.E. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 2701-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Narasimhan J. Wang M. Fu Z. Klein J.M. Haas A.L. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27356-27365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Similar to ubiquitin, full-length ISG15 can form thioester bond with the activating enzyme UBE1L and conjugating enzyme UbcH8 (5Zhao C. Beaudenon S.L. Kelley M.L. Waddell M.B. Yuan W. Schulman B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 17Kim K.I. Giannakopoulos N.V. Virgin H.W. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9592-9600Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain contains a classical conjugating motif LRLRGG (Fig. 1A). To understand the thiol esterification properties of the C-terminal domain of ISG15 (ISG15C), we examined the activity of ISG15C during the first two steps of ISGylation, activation and transthiolation. In vitro experiments were carried out at 25 °C with purified proteins GST-UBE1L, UbcH8, and FLAG-ISG15 or FLAG-ISG15C, and 10 min later the reaction products were detected by Western blotting (see “Experimental Procedures”). Like full-length ISG15, ISG15C can form intermediate adducts with UBE1L and UbcH8, respectively (Fig. 1B, lanes 6 and 8). These products are linked by thioester bonds, as indicated by their disappearance upon the addition of dithiothreitol in the loading buffer to stop the reactions (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 7). Furthermore, the amounts of the intermediate adducts of ISG15C with UBE1L and UbcH8 are apparently the same as those of UBE1L∼ISG15 and UbcH8∼ISG15, suggesting that ISG15C, similar to full-length ISG15, is capable of being activated and transthiolated by UBE1L and UbcH8 enzymes sequentially (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 8). Therefore, the C-terminal domain of ISG15 is sufficient to link via thioester bonds to the activating and conjugating enzymes, whereas the N-terminal UbL domain does not appear essential for activation and transthiolation in protein ISGylation. Both the N- and C-terminal Domains of ISG15 Are Required for Its Efficient Conjugation to Cellular Proteins—Because the N-terminal domain is dispensable in the formation of intermediate thioester adducts of ISG15 with UBE1L and UbcH8, we investigated whether it influences the ligation process, the third step of ISGylation. Because the expression of pCMV-Tag-3B-ISG15C is very low as compared with that of the ISG15 construct in HEK 293T cells, we generated two eukaryotic constructs pCMV-Tag-3B-GB1-ISG15 and pCMV-Tag-3B-GB1-ISG15C, which express similarly high level of GB1 fusion proteins Myc-GB1-ISG15 and Myc-GB1-ISG15C, respectively (18Bao W.J. Gao Y.G. Chang Y.G. Zhang T.Y. Lin X.J. Yan X.Z. Hu H.Y. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 47: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The two constructs were transfected into 293T cells with or without pCMV-Tag-2B-UBE1L and pCMV-Tag-2B-UbcH8 that express the activating enzyme UBE1L and the conjugating enzyme UbcH8, respectively. After 48 h, total cells were lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody. ISG15 is capable of being conjugated to a large number of cellular proteins with the assistance of endogenous E3 enzymes, as shown, a smear band dominantly around the molecular mass of 250 kDa (Fig. 1C). As a comparison, ISG15C can also be conjugated to cellular proteins, but the total level of ISG15C conjugates is much lower than that with the full-length ISG15, suggesting that deletion of the N-terminal domain has a great impact on ISG15 conjugation to cellular proteins. Therefore, we infer that both domains of ISG15 are required for efficient conjugation to cellular proteins, although the C-terminal domain of ISG15 possesses the conjugating motif LRLRGG that has been demonstrated to be essential for ubiquitination (19Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kerscher O. Felberbaum R. Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 21Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that although the C-terminal domain of ISG15 is sufficient for ISG15 linkage to UBE1L and UbcH8 via thiol esterification, both domains are required for modification of substrates by attaching ISG15 to the ϵ-amino groups of lysine residues. NS1B Inhibits ISG15 Conjugation to Cellular Proteins and Specifically Binds to the N-terminal UbL Domain of ISG15—To define the roles of these respective UbL domains of ISG15, we examined whether NS1B directly interacts with ISG15 protein and how NS1B inhibits the ISGylation level in cultured cells. We generated a eukaryotic expression construct pcDNA3-HA-NS1B, which produces an NS1B protein with an HA epitope at its N terminus, and then transfected it into A549 cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagents, followed by 48 h of treatment with IFN-α 2a. As shown in Fig. 2A, the cellular level of ISG15 conjugates, detected by anti-ISG15 antibody, is markedly reduced by expression of NS1B as compared with that in mock-treated cells. This result demonstrates that NS1B protein alone is capable of inhibiting the ISG15 conjugation to cellular target proteins. It was previously postulated that the direct interaction between NS1B and ISG15 blocks the activation of ISG15 by UBE1L and thus ISG15 cannot be recognized by its activating enzyme UBE1L (4Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Our above results prompt us to examine whether NS1B binds specifically to the C-terminal domain of ISG15. To this end, we carried out a GST pull down assay with GST fusion of either full-length ISG15 or each of its two domains. Unexpectedly, ISG15N can pull down NS1B as efficiently as the full-length ISG15, whereas ISG15C cannot (Fig. 2B, lanes 7-9). This observation is further verified by Western blotting with anti-His antibody for detecting NS1B, which contains a C-terminal His6 tag. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that NS1B specifically binds to the N-terminal domain of ISG15, suggesting that, besides the C-terminal domain, the N-terminal domain may play a role in promoting E3-mediated transfer of ISG15 to cellular targets in regulating ISG15 modification. We next corroborated that ISG15 binds with the N-terminal fragment (residues 1-103) of NS1B (supplemental Fig. S1). Then we applied NS1B-1-103 to examine its interaction with the two UbL domains of ISG15. The result shows that both full-length ISG15 and ISG15N can efficiently pull down similar amounts of NS1B-1-103, whereas ISG15C cannot (Fig. 2C, lanes 7-9). Compared with the strong bands for NS1B-1-103 pulled down by ISG15 and ISG15N, the very weak band for NS1B-1-103 by ISG15C pulldown is probably due to the nonspecific adsorption of the NS1B-1-103 protein by the beads. Furthermore, we carried out a gel filtration analysis of the interaction between NS1B-1-103 and either ISG15N or ISG15C. The elution peak for the mixture of NS1B-1-103 and ISG15N shifts toward the higher molecular mass end of the profile (Fig. 2D, left panel), as compared with those for ISG15N and NS1B-1-103 alone, indicating formation of the complex of NS1B-1-103 and ISG15N. In contrast, NS1B-1-103 and ISG15C do not co-elute, suggesting that they do not form a complex (Fig. 2D, right panel). These results demonstrate that NS1B specifically binds to the N-terminal domain of ISG15 through its integrated N-terminal part (residues 1-103), including the three-α-helix domain and the extended region (supplemental Fig. S1). NS1B-1-103 Binds Specifically to the N-terminal Domain of ISG15: NMR Evidence—To directly observe the interaction between NS1B-1-103 with ISG15N in the context of full-length ISG15, we carried out NMR experiments for 15N-labeled FLAG-ISG15 titrated with GB1-NS1B-1-103. The GB1 fusion protein was applied for the purpose of enhancing the solubility of NS1B-1-103 (22Chang Y.G. Song A.X. Gao Y.G. Shi Y.H. Lin X.J. Cao X.T. Lin D.H. Hu H.Y. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The sequence-specific assignment for 95% backbone resonances of the amino acid residues of ISG15 was achieved by analyzing a set of two-dimensional and three-dimensional NMR spectra (supplemental Fig. S2). It is worth noting that the FLAG tagging of ISG15 made it possible to acquire NMR data on ISG15 by dramatically enhancing its stability at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 3, with the increasing amount of GB1-NS1B-1-103 at a molar ratio 1:1 (Fig. 3B) and 2:1 (Fig. 3C)of NS1B-1-103 to ISG15, the intensities (as indicated by peak heights) of the 1H-15N cross peaks are gradually reduced, indicating the binding of NS1B-1-103 to ISG15. To analyze the peak intensity changes of ISG15 upon titration with GB1-NS1B-1-103, the peak intensity of each amide of free ISG15 is normalized as 1, and the ratios of peak intensities at each titration step to those with free ISG15 are plotted against the residue number of ISG15 (Fig. 3, A-C, left panels). These data show that the N-terminal domain of ISG15 exhibits a more intensive reduction in peak intensities than the C-terminal domain does. The mean peak intensities are 0.26 and 0.38 for ISG15N and ISG15C, respectively, at the 1:1 molar ratio of GB1-NS1B-1-103 and FLAG-ISG15, and the mean peak intensities are 0.09 and 0.25 at the 2:1 ratio. To verify the specific binding, we labeled these two UbL domains, FLAG-ISG15N and FLAG-ISG15C, and performed titration with GB1-NS1B-1-103. The spectra show that FLAG-ISG15N exhibits a reduction in peak intensities upon the addition of NS1B-1-103 (Fig. 3D), whereas FLAG-ISG15C exhibits no significant change in peak intensities (Fig. 3E), suggesting that NS1B specifically binds to the N-terminal domain of ISG15 but not to the C-terminal domain. The tumbling rate of the NS1B-ISG15 complex that is slower than free ISG15 may also contribute to the peak broadening. Taken together, we conclude that NS1B-1-103 specifically binds to the N-terminal UbL domain of ISG15 in the context of full-length ISG15. NS1B-1-103 Binds to the N-terminal Domain of ISG15 with a 1:1 Stoichiometry—To further understand the mechanism by which NS1B inhibits the conjugation of ISG15 to cellular proteins, it is necessary to clarify the form of the ISG15-NS1B complex in solution, because the crystal structure of NS1B-1-103 (Protein Data Bank code 1XEQ) shows a dimeric form (23Yin C.

We performed a gel filtration analysis to characterize NS1B-1-103 and its complex with full-length ISG15. Fig. 4A shows that the elution peaks of the mixture of NS1B-1-103 and ISG15 shift toward the higher molecular mass end of the profile, indicating formation of the complex between NS1B-1-103 (12 kDa) and ISG15 (17 kDa). The constituents of the NS1B-1-103 and ISG15 complex show two bands each for NS1B-1-103 and ISG15, in the SDS-PAGE gel (15%) with Coo-massie staining (Fig. 4B, lane 3). To indicate the relative molecular mass of NS1B-1-103 and its complex with ISG15, we chose cytochrome c (13 kDa), UCH-L1 (24 kDa), and GST (55 kDa, dimeric form) as protein markers. The elution volume for NS1B-1-103 is very similar to that for cytochrome c but far from that for UCH-L1, indicating that it exists in a monomeric form in solution (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the mixture of NS1B-1-103 and ISG15 elutes at a volume similar to that for UCH-L1, suggesting that they form a complex of 1:1 stoichiometry with apparent molecular mass of about 29 kDa (Fig. 4D). With a complex of NS1B-1-103 and ISG15 with a 2:1 or 2:2 manner, the apparent molecular masses would be 41 and 53 kDa, respectively, but in the elution profile (Fig. 4D), there exist no such peaks. Thus, we conclude that the complex of NS1B-1-103 and ISG15 is formed by a 1:1 stoichiometry. NS1B Does Not Inhibit Thiol Esterification of ISG15 toward UBE1L and UbcH8—Although NS1B specifically binds to the N-terminal domain of ISG15 and the N-terminal deletion of ISG15 has no effect on its linkage to UBE1L and UbcH8, it remains uncertain whether NS1B binding to the N-terminal domain affects the thiol esterification of the C-terminal domain toward UBE1L and UbcH8. We carried out in vitro competition assays with ISG15, ISG15C, and either UBE1L or UBE1L and UbcH8 in the presence or absence of NS1B-1-103, NS1B-1-145, and full-length NS1B. Increasing the amount of either NS1B or its two fragments has no significant effect on the amounts of the intermediate adducts between UBE1L and ISG15 (Fig. 5, A and C). The amounts of UBE1L∼ISG15C, of which the modifier ISG15C has been demonstrated not to interact with NS1B, is not affected by the addition of NS1B and its two fragments (Fig. 5C, lanes 5-8). Similarly, formation of UbcH8∼ISG15 adducts is not significantly influenced by NS1B and its two fragments, either (Fig. 5, B and D). Also, the amounts of UbcH8∼ISG15C adducts apparently remain the same in the presence or absence of NS1B (Fig. 5D, lanes 5-8). Thus far, it remains possible that the UbcH8∼ISG15 adducts may form at a higher rate in the absence of NS1B than in the presence of NS1B, but the reaction without NS1B can reach the same end point more rapidly than the reaction with NS1B. To exclude this possibility, we performed a time course analysis on the reaction of ISG15 and UbcH8. Fig. 5E shows that during the time course of 0-15 min, the amount of UbcH8∼ISG15 adducts steadily increases, indicating that the reaction has not yet reached its end point after a 10-min interval of the reaction. Thus, we conclude that although NS1B interacts with ISG15, it is not likely to inhibit thiol esterification of ISG15 toward UBE1L and UbcH8. We have demonstrated that both UbL domains of ISG15 are required for its efficient conjugation to cellular proteins (Fig. 1C), although the N-terminal domain may not participate in the first two steps of protein ISGylation, that is, ISG15 activation by the activating enzyme UBE1L and ISG15 linkage via a thioester bond to the conjugating enzyme UbcH8. It appears that the N-terminal part plays a regulatory role in enhancing E3-mediated transfer of ISG15 from UbcH8 to ISG15 substrates. In addition, by performing NMR titration and GST pulldown assay, we observed that there is no direct physical interaction between ISG15 and UbcH8 (supplemental Fig. S3B) or several of its substrates including Hsc70, cofilin, and destrin (data not shown). Thus, we presume that the regulatory role of the N-terminal UbL domain of ISG15 is somehow associated with ISG15 E3 ligases. The activities of the E3 ligases can be modulated in a variety of ways, such as phosphorylation, modification by ubiquitin-like proteins, binding of inhibitory proteins, and regulation by adaptor proteins that bring together E3s and E2s or substrates (24Gallagher E.

Therefore, the N-terminal domain of ISG15 represents a distinct way to regulate the conjugation of ISG15 to its substrates probably by enhancing the activities of E3 ligases through specifically interacting with the enzymes or the substrates. So far, only a limited number of ISG15 E3 ligases, including HERC5, HHARI, and Efp, have been identified (6Zou W. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3989-3994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 7Wong J.J. Pung Y.F. Sze N.S. Chin K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 4334-4338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Of note is that ISG15 has been shown to interact with HERC5, a HECT-type ISG15 E3 ligase that has been demonstrated by two research groups to be required for ISG15 conjugation to a broad spectrum of cellular targets (7Wong J.J. Pung Y.F. Sze N.S. Chin K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10735-10740Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar,8Dastur A. Beaudenon S. Kelley M. Krug R.M. Huibregtse J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4334-4338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Whether ISG15 interacts with Efp remains to be examined, and other ISG15 E3 ligases are to be identified in the future. Nevertheless, comparing the effect of the N-terminal deletion of ISG15 on the total level of cellular ISG15 conjugates with that caused by small interfering RNA knock-down of HERC5 suggests that it is possible that the N-terminal domain of ISG15 acts in conjunction with HERC5 to ensure the efficient modification of cellular proteins by ISG15. An in vitro reconstituted system is a prerequisite to determine whether HERC5 or other ISG15 E3s could act in such a way as to promote protein ISGylation. However, as noted by the two groups who identified HERC5 as an ISG15 ligase, the full-length HERC5 expression has not been successful in the bacterial system, although the HECT domain (residues 700-1024) of HERC5 has been expressed in E. coli and purified in our laboratory. 4Y.-G. Chang, X.-Z. Yan, Y.-Y. Xie, X.-C. Gao, A.-X. Song, D.-E. Zhang, and H.-Y. Hu, unpublished data. We have also demonstrated that NS1B alone inhibits in vivo ISG15 conjugation to cellular proteins (Fig. 2A). A set of assays including GST pulldown, gel filtration, and NMR titration have clearly demonstrated that NS1B binds specifically to the N-terminal UbL domain of ISG15 but not to the C-terminal domain and that both the three-α-helix domain and the extended region are required for NS1B binding to the N-terminal domain of ISG15. Yuan and Krug (4Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) proposed by in vitro GST pulldown with radioactive detection that NS1B blocks protein ISGylation by inhibiting the activation step through interacting with ISG15. Our observation indicates that NS1B does not influence the amount of ISG15 being attached to UBE1L and UbcH8 but does impede ligation of ISG15 to its substrates. This proposal is supported by several lines of evidence that (1Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the C-terminal part of ISG15 possesses a similar ability of thiol esterification in the first two steps of protein ISGylation as does the full-length ISG15 (Fig. 1B); (2Knight Jr., E. Fahey D. Cordova B. Hillman M. Kutny R. Reich N. Blomstrom D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4520-4522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) deletion of the N-terminal domain significantly reduces the ISG15 conjugates (Fig. 1C); and (3Dao C.T. Zhang D.E. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 2701-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) NS1B specifically binds to the N-terminal UbL domain of ISG15 but not to the C-terminal part (Figs. 2 and 3). Considering the finding that the C-terminal domain of ISG15 functions in the conjugation to substrates as ubiquitin does in ubiquitination, whereas the N-terminal domain may play a role in the ligation step, we herein propose a putative model for the mechanism of ISG15 conjugation to cellular proteins (Fig. 6). Suppose that an E3 ligase associates with UbcH8 via its adducted ISG15 to promote ligation of ISG15 to the cellular substrates, and NS1B targets the N-terminal domain of ISG15 by competing with the E3 ligase to impede the interaction between UbcH8∼ISG15 and the enzyme. Thus, NS1B inhibits ISGylation probably by blocking the E3-mediated transfer of ISG15 from UbcH8 to the substrates. Compared with the C-terminal conjugating domain of ISG15 that functions in covalently bonding with E1, E2, E3 (HECT-type), or substrates by its C-terminal LRLRGG motif, the N-terminal domain (regulatory domain) of ISG15 may play an important regulatory role of promoting the transfer ability of ISG15 E3 ligases in protein ISGylation.

One important step during cell migration is the formation of lamellipodia at the leading edge of migrating cells. Here we report that the second messenger cAMP inhibits the migration of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and mouse breast tumor cells. cAMP acts downstream of the small GTPase Rac and interferes with the formation of lamellipodia. Moreover, cAMP decreases the phosphorylation of the myosin light chain at the leading edge of cells and increases the phosphorylation of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. Together with our previous report of a positive role of another second messenger, cGMP, in lamellipodium formation, our data indicate that cAMP and cGMP play opposite roles in modulating lamellipodium formation.

Cell migration is a cellular event that is critical for various physiological processes and pathological responses such as embryonic development, angiogenesis, immune function and inflammation, axonal guidance and neural development, tissue repair, and tumor metastasis (1Ridley A.J.

Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar). Cell migration is a sequential and interrelated multistep process. It involves the formation of lamellipodia/membrane protrusions at the front edge, cycles of adhesion and detachment to the extracellular matrix, cell body contraction and translocation, and tail retraction. For efficient migration to occur, these activities need to be spatially and temporally coordinated through complex signaling events. A better understanding of the regulation of cell migration will lead to the development of novel therapeutics for human disease conditions such as tumor metastasis. Lamellipodium formation is an important step during cell migration (3Small J.V. Stradal T. Vignal E. Rottner K.

The lamellipodium is a specialized subcellular structure at the front of a migrating cell. It is mainly a cytoskeletal actin projection. The tips of lamellipodia localize and harness actin polymerization for cell migration. Lamellipodia display characteristic highly active behavior. They spread forwards quickly with sometimes retracting, ruffling, or bubbling (3Small J.V. Stradal T. Vignal E. Rottner K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 112-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Cells migrate in response to specific external signals. This orchestrated movement is subjected to modulation. cAMP is a ubiquitous cellular second messenger and could regulate a wide range of cellular processes, including cell migration (5Beavo J.A.

Although cAMP could modulate cell migration, the mechanism by which cAMP plays its role in regulating fibroblast and tumor cell migration is not clear. Here we use both mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) 2The abbreviations used are: MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; VASP, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; MLC, myosin light chain; MTOC, microtubule organizing center; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine. 2The abbreviations used are: MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; VASP, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; MLC, myosin light chain; MTOC, microtubule organizing center; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine. and mouse 4T1 breast tumor cells to study the modulation of cell migration by cAMP. We found that cAMP inhibits the migration of MEFs and 4T1 breast tumor cells by interfering with the formation of lamellipodia at the leading edge during cell migration.

MEF cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. 4T1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. PDGF-BB was from Sigma. LPA was from Cayman Chemical Co. Forskolin, 6-benzoyl-cAMP, and H-89 were from Calbiochem. In Vitro Wound-healing Cell Migration Assay—Cell migration assays were performed as described previously (13Shan D. Chen L. Njardarson J.T. Gaul C. Ma X. Danishefsky S.J. Huang X.-Y. Proc. Natl.

Cells were allowed to form a confluent monolayer in a 24-well plate coated with gelatin before wounding. The wound was made by scraping a conventional pipette tip across the monolayer. Cell migration was induced by adding medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 ng/ml PDGF (for MEF cells) or 10 μm LPA (for 4T1 cells). For MEF cells, it typically took 8–10 h for the wound to close. For 4T1 cells, it typically took 12–14 h for the wound to close. When the wound for the positive control closed, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet staining solution. Boyden Chamber Cell Migration Assay—MEF and 4T1 cells (5 × 104) suspended in starvation medium were added to the upper chamber of an insert (6.5-mm diameter, 8-μm pore size; BD Biosciences), and the insert was placed in a 24-well plate containing starvation medium with or without 10% fetal bovine serum abd 20 ng/ml PDGF (for MEF cells) or 10 μm LPA (for 4T1 cells). When used, inhibitors were added to both chambers. Migration assays were carried out for 4 h, and cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were stained with crystal violet staining solution, and cells on the upper side of the insert were removed with a cotton swab. Three randomly selected fields (×10 objective) were photographed, and the migrated cells were counted.

Cells cultured on gelatin-coated glass coverslips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. To block nonspecific binding, the cells were incubated with a solution of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min and then incubated with primary antibody at appropriate dilutions (1:100 for rabbit anti-phospho-Ser-19 MLC antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), 1:2000 for anti-tubulin antibody, and 1:1000 for anti-VASP antibody (Cell Signaling Technology)) for 1 h. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used to visualize F-actin. After incubation with primary antibody, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). The coverslips were then fixed on slides and imaged using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Microtubule Organizing Center (MTOC) Reorientation—MTOC reorientation was analyzed as described previously (20Guo D. Tan Y.C. Wang D. Madhusoodanan K.S. Zheng Y. Maack T. Zhang J.J. Huang X.-Y. Cell. 2007; 128: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) with modification. Cells were allowed to grow to confluence on a glass coverslip coated with gelatin. Serum was added immediately after wounding. MTOC reorientation was assessed 2 h after wounding by immunolabeling using anti-pericentrin antibody. Cells in which the MTOC was within the quadrant facing the wound were scored positive, and for each condition, at least 100 wound-edge cells were examined. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the means ± S.D. from three experiments and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test with significance defined as p < 0.05. Increase of cAMP Plays an Inhibitory Role in the Migration of Fibroblast and Breast Tumor Cells—During our investigation of the role of the second messenger cGMP in cell migration (20Guo D. Tan Y.C. Wang D. Madhusoodanan K.S. Zheng Y. Maack T. Zhang J.J. Huang X.-Y. Cell. 2007; 128: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we noticed that IBMX, a broad-spectrum phosphodiesterase inhibitor preventing the breakdown of cAMP and cGMP, inhibited serum-induced migration of MEF cells (Fig. 1A). Because we had shown that cGMP plays a positive role in serum-induced MEF cell migration (20Guo D. Tan Y.C. Wang D. Madhusoodanan K.S. Zheng Y. Maack T. Zhang J.J. Huang X.-Y. Cell. 2007; 128: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), here we investigated a possible inhibitory role of cAMP in MEF cell migration. We used two complementary approaches to study serum-induced MEF cell migration in the presence or absence of forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase leading to the increase of cellular cAMP (16Sun Y. Huang J. Xiang Y. Bastepe M. Juppner H. Kobilka B.K. Zhang J.J. Huang X.-Y. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the qualitative in vitro wound-healing assay, MEF cells were grown to confluence. A wound was made in the middle of the culture plate with a pipette tip. After ∼10 h in the presence of serum, whereas control MEF cells migrated and covered the “wound,” the addition of 50 μm forskolin significantly inhibited serum-induced MEF cell migration (Fig. 1B). These results were confirmed with the quantitative Boyden chamber assays with 4 h of forskolin treatment (Fig. 1C). Treatment of MEF cells with forskolin resulted in a dosage-dependent inhibition of cell migration with an IC50 of ∼30 μm (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, treatment of MEF cells with isoproterenol, which activates the endogenous Gs-coupled β-adrenergic receptor and results in the elevation of cellular cAMP, also inhibited PDGF-induced cell migration (Fig. 1E). This inhibitory effect was abolished in Gαs-/- cells. Forskolin was still able to inhibit PDGF-induced MEF cell migration in the absence of Gαs (Fig. 1E). These data demonstrate that an increase of cellular cAMP could inhibit serum-induced MEF cell migration. To investigate whether this inhibitory role of cAMP in cell migration is unique to MEF cells, we studied the effect of forskolin on the migration of highly invasive mouse 4T1 breast tumor cells. As shown by both the wound-healing assay (Fig. 2A) and the Boyden chamber assay (Fig. 2B), the addition of 50 μm forskolin inhibited serum-induced 4T1 cell migration. Similarly, treatment with IBMX decreased serum-induced 4T1 cell migration (Fig. 2A). These results show that cAMP has an inhibitory role in the migration of breast tumor cells in addition to MEF cells. Because serum contains various growth factors, we next studied whether cAMP inhibits cell migration induced by several growth factors known to have chemotactic function, including PDGF and LPA. PDGF efficiently induced the migration of MEF cells, and forskolin treatment inhibited PDGF-induced MEF cell migration (Fig. 1, B and C). Similarly, LPA increased the migration of the 4T1 breast tumor cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Forskolin treatment decreased LPA-induced 4T1 cell migration (Fig. 2, A and B). Although PDGF works on its receptor tyrosine kinase, LPA acts through its G protein-coupled receptor. Collectively, our data suggest that increases of cAMP play an inhibitory role in controlling MEF and 4T1 cell migration induced by various factors. cAMP Acts Downstream of the Small GTPase Rac—To explore the molecular mechanism by which cAMP inhibits serum-induced cell migration, we first investigated at which stage cAMP acts. The Rho family small GTPase Rac plays an essential role in serum-induced cell migration (14Shan D. Chen L. Wang D. Tan Y.C. Gu J.L. Huang X.-Y. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 707-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Yang S. Huang X.-Y. J. Biol.

Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar). Expression (through retroviral infection) of dominant-negative Rac (Rac1(T14N)) in MEF cells or in 4T1 breast tumor cells decreased serum-induced migration of MEF cells or 4T1 cells, respectively (Fig. 3, A–D). These results indicate that Rac is required for serum-induced MEF and 4T1 cell migration. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3, E–H, Rac is also sufficient to induce MEF and 4T1 cell migration, as expression of constitutively active Rac (Rac1(G12V)) in MEF cells or 4T1 cells induced the migration of these cells. To study whether cAMP acts upstream or downstream of Rac, we examined the effect of forskolin on the migration induced by constitutively active Rac. MEF cells were infected with retroviruses carrying constitutively active Rac1(G12V) or control retroviral vector. Cells were then treated with forskolin. As shown in Fig. 3 (E–H), forskolin decreased the migration of MEF cells or 4T1 cells induced by constitutively active Rac. These data are consistent with a model that cAMP plays its inhibitory role by acting downstream of (or on) Rac in the pathway of serum-induced cell migration. cAMP Inhibits Lamellipodium Formation—To further investigate the molecular mechanism of the cAMP action, we studied the effect of cAMP on cellular events during cell migration. Rac is known to mediate serum-induced lamellipodium formation and focal adhesion formation and turnover during cell migration (1Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3812) Google Scholar). We first examined the lamellipodium formation. Lamellipodia are membrane extensions at the front of migrating cells (3Small J.V. Stradal T. Vignal E. Rottner K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 112-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). This structure could be visualized by the staining of actin filaments at the leading edge. Two h after making the wound in the in vitro wound-healing assay, serum effectively induced the formation of lamellipodia with a distinct polarized actin cytoskeleton with strong membrane protrusions toward the leading edge (Fig. 4A). In contrast, forskolin treatment disrupted the polarized distribution of F-actin (Fig. 4A). Instead, forskolin-treated cells adopted an elongated morphology with a non-polarized F-actin meshwork. These data demonstrate that cAMP interferes with the lamellipodium formation. We also examined the effect of cAMP on focal adhesion turnover and on the microtubule dynamics. We found that forskolin treatment had no effect on microtubule dynamics (Fig. 4, B and C) and no effect on focal adhesion turnover (data not shown). The MTOC reorientation and the formation of microtubule protrusions in the leading edge contribute to directional cell migration (1Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3812) Google Scholar, 22Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Cell. 2001; 106: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 (B and C), in the presence of serum, the MTOC and the microtubule cytoskeleton reorganized to face the wound. Forskolin treatment did not affect the polarization of the MTOC or the protrusion of microtubules. These data suggest that cAMP inhibits cell migration by disrupting F-actin rather than microtubule dynamics within the leading edge of migrating cells. PKA and pMLC Contribute to cAMP Inhibitory Function— To gain a biochemical understanding of the inhibitory function of cAMP in MEF cell migration, we tested the participation of several signaling components in this regulatory pathway. The best characterized direct effector of cAMP is PKA. We first tested whether PKA contributes to the cAMP inhibitory function in MEF cell migration. We examined the MEF cell migration in the presence or absence of 6-benzoyl-cAMP, a selective cAMP analogue that directly activates PKA (5Beavo J.A. Brunton L.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, the addition of 6-benzoyl-cAMP inhibited the serum-induced migration of MEF cells, implying that activation of PKA is capable of inhibiting MEF cell migration. The involvement of PKA was further investigated using H-89, a specific PKA inhibitor. In MEF cells, the addition of H-89 stimulated serum-induced cell migration, consistent with the inhibitory role of PKA in controlling cell migration (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, H-89 reduced the inhibitory effect of forskolin on serum-induced MEF cell migration (Fig. 5B). Hence, the data from both the activation of PKA and the inhibition of PKA are consistent with a negative role of PKA in MEF cell migration. Of the reported physiological substrates for PKA, one is MLC kinase (23Nishikawa M. de Lanerolle P. Lincoln T.M. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8429-8436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKA can phosphorylate and decrease the activity of MLC kinase (23Nishikawa M. de Lanerolle P. Lincoln T.M. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8429-8436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Garcia J.G. Davis H.W. Patterson C.E. J. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1955-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). MLC kinase phosphorylates the regulatory light chain of myosin II and activates myosin II (26Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4527-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The essential role of myosin II in actin cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell migration has long been appreciated (27Spudich J.A. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Myosin II regulates the retrograde flow of F-actin in the lamella and plays an essential role in F-actin-driven cell migration (28Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1325-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated MLC (at Ser-19) appears to be strong in both the anterior and posterior regions of motile cells (15Yang S. Huang X.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27130-27137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 29Chew T.L. Wolf W.A. Gallagher P.J. Matsumura F. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Worthylake R.A. Lemoine S. Watson J.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of the myosin light chain is required for the anchorage of lamellipodia (3Small J.V. Stradal T. Vignal E. Rottner K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 112-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of cAMP/PKA activation on MLC phosphorylation in cell migration, we first examined whether forskolin could reduce the phosphorylation of MLC in MEF cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, forskolin treatment significantly reduced the level of phosphorylated MLC, whereas the amount of total MLC was not affected. Next, we examined the distribution of phosphorylated MLC in cells at the leading edge of a wound with an antibody recognizing phosphorylated MLC. As shown in Fig. 6B, in the absence of forskolin, strong staining of phosphorylated MLC was observed in the lamella of migrating cells (indicated by arrowheads). In contrast, activation of cAMP/PKA by forskolin disrupted the anterior staining of phosphorylated MLC. To further confirm that the cAMP effect is on the phosphorylation of MLC, we tested whether raising the phosphorylation of MLC (by inhibiting the MLC phosphatase) could attenuate the cAMP inhibitory effect. As shown in Fig. 6B, treatment of cells with low concentrations of calyculin A (0.5 nm), a specific inhibitor for MLC phosphatase (31Gupton S.L. Waterman-Storer C.M. Cell. 2006; 125: 1361-1374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), restored the accumulation of phosphorylated MLC at the leading edge of the cells (indicated by arrowheads). Moreover, calyculin treatment also attenuated the inhibitory effect of forskolin on serum-induced MEF cell migration as measured by the Boyden chamber assay (Fig. 6C) and the wound-healing assay (Fig. 6D). Taken together, our data indicate that forskolin decreases the phosphorylation of MLC at the leading edge and provide a possible biochemical mechanism for the inhibitory role of cAMP in cell migration. Another PKA substrate that is involved in lamellipodial dynamics is VASP (32Gomez T.M. Robles E. Neuron. 2004; 42: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 33Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VASP proteins could be targeted to the leading edge by activated Rac in migrating fibroblasts (34Reinhard M. Jarchau T. Walter U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 243-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). VASP phosphorylation by PKA diminishes VASP binding to F-actin and suppresses the actin-nucleating activity of VASP, leading to decreased actin polymerization (33Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the cAMP inhibitory effect on cell migration is accompanied by increased phosphorylation of VASP, we examined the phosphorylation state of VASP with or without forskolin treatment. Phosphorylation of VASP causes an electrophoretic mobility shift in SDS-PAGE (35Harbeck B. Huttelmaier S. Schluter K. Jockusch B.M. Illenberger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30817-30825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6E, forskolin treatment markedly increased the phosphorylation of VASP. Together with the effect of cAMP/PKA on the phosphorylation of MLC, cAMP/PKA could have multiple targets in their effects on cell migration and lamellipodium formation. Conclusion—In summary, cAMP inhibits the migration of MEFs and mouse 4T1 breast tumor cells. cAMP acts downstream of Rac. Furthermore, cAMP interferes with the formation of lamellipodia. cAMP decreases the phosphorylation of MLC and increases the phosphorylation of VASP. Myosin-based contractility is important for cell migration at the leading edge as well as at the trailing edge (15Yang S. Huang X.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27130-27137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 29Chew T.L. Wolf W.A. Gallagher P.J. Matsumura F. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Worthylake R.A. Lemoine S. Watson J.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In polarized migrating MEFs, there are two areas of phosphorylated MLC staining: leading edge staining and trailing tail staining (15Yang S. Huang X.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27130-27137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In growth factor-induced migration of MEFs, we have shown previously that Ca2+ influx, through calmodulin and MLC kinase, increases the phosphorylation of MLC at the training tail and contributes to the trailing tail contraction; Ca2+ influx has no effect on the phosphorylation of MLC at the leading edge (15Yang S. Huang X.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27130-27137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Here cAMP appears to decrease the phosphorylation of MLC at the front as well as the tail of migrating cells. Although we examined the effect of cAMP/PKA on the phosphorylation of MLC and VASP, we did not intend to state that phosphorylations of MLC and VASP are the only or major mechanisms by which cAMP inhibits lamellipodium formation. cAMP/PKA can regulate the activity of other proteins involved in actin cytoskeletons. For example, another means by which cAMP/PKA could modulate the actin cytoskeletal reorganization is through the AKAPs (Akinase anchoring proteins) such as WAVE-1 and AKAP-Lbc because these proteins are known to regulate actin polymerization or Rho activity (36Westphal R.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylation of integrin (such as α4) within the protrusion is critical for integrin-dependent cell migration (38Goldfinger L.E. Han J. Kiosses W.B. Howe A.K. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). With the reported positive and negative effects of cAMP/PKA on the migration of different cell types, it is likely that the spatial-temporal distribution and activation of cAMP/PKA are crucial (39Howe A.K. Baldor L.C. Hogan B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14320-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2013341229,"Caveolin-1 binds cholesterol and caveola formation involves caveolin-1 oligomerization and cholesterol association. The role of cholesterol in caveolae has so far been addressed by methods that compromise membrane integrity and abolish caveolar invaginations. To study the importance of sterol specificity for the structure and function of caveolae, we replaced cholesterol in mammalian cells with its immediate precursor desmosterol by inhibiting 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase. Desmosterol could substitute for cholesterol in maintaining cell growth, membrane integrity, and preserving caveolar invaginations. However, in desmosterol cells the affinity of caveolin-1 for sterol and the stability of caveolin oligomers were decreased. Moreover, caveolar invaginations became more heterogeneous in dimensions and in the number of caveolin-1 molecules per caveola. Despite the altered caveolar structure, caveolar ligand uptake was only moderately inhibited. We found that in desmosterol cells, Src kinase phosphorylated Cav1 at Tyr14 more avidly than in cholesterol cells. Taken the role of Cav1 Tyr14 phosphorylation in caveolar endocytosis, this may help to preserve caveolar uptake in desmosterol cells. We conclude that a sterol C24 double bond interferes with caveolin-sterol interaction and perturbs caveolar morphology but facilitates Cav1 Src phosphorylation and allows caveolar endocytosis. More generally, substitution of cholesterol by a structurally closely related sterol provides a method to selectively modify membrane protein-sterol affinity, structure and function of cholesterol-dependent domains without compromising membrane integrity.

Hanzal-Bayer M. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The role of cholesterol in caveolae has so far been addressed using treatments that sequester or remove cholesterol, thus compromising membrane integrity, causing the loss of invaginated caveolae and affecting many cellular processes (9Parton R.G. Simons K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 10Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 353: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, functions assigned to caveolae/caveolin based on cholesterol depletion must be assessed critically (9Parton R.G. Simons K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). In this work, we studied the importance of the sterol structure for caveolae by a method circumventing the side effects of cholesterol removal or sequestration. Cells were treated with a specific inhibitor of 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), the enzyme converting desmosterol to cholesterol. This resulted in the accumulation of desmosterol, which differs from cholesterol by an additional double bond between carbon atoms 24 and 25 in the sterol tail. We chose this strategy as data on DHCR24-deficient mice (11Lu X. Kambe F. Cao X. Yoshida T. Ohmori S. Murakami K. Kaji T. Ishii T. Zadworny D. Seo H.

Briefly, trypsinized HeLa cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline to a dilution of 2 million cells/ml. 100 μl of cell suspension was mixed with 300 μl of 1 μm TMA-DPH solution. Polarized fluorescence was measured and anisotropy calculated. Cell death was found to be <5% as determined by trypan blue exclusion after anisotropy measurements. Subcellular Membrane Fractionations—The sucrose density gradient fractionation was preformed according to Ref. 13Vainio S. Jansen M. Koivusalo M. Rog T. Karttunen M. Vattulainen I. Ikonen E. J. Biol.

For Triton-Optiprep™ fractionation, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min and incubated for 10 min on ice in 240 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% sucrose, and 1% Triton X-100, CLAP). The lysate was then mixed with 480 μl of 60% Optiprep™ (Nycomed-Pharma, Oslo, Norway) and overlaid with step gradients of 35, 30, 25, 20, and 0% Optiprep™ in lysis buffer. After centrifugation for 4 h at 40,000 × g at 4 °C with a SW60Ti rotor, fractions were collected and used for protein or lipid determinations. The detergent-resistant membranes (DRM) fractions of ts-v-S-MDCK cells were isolated as above except that Na3VO4 was present in all buffers and cells were homogenized by passing for 10 times through 18-gauge needle before mixing with 60% Optiprep™. Immunoisolation of Caveolar Membranes—Adipocytes were prepared from epididymal fat of male Wistar rats according to Ref. 28Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The fat pads were minced in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm d-glucose, 3% BSA, 20 mm NaHCO3, 118 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 1.2 mm MgSO4·2H2O, 1.25 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 mm HEPES. Adipose tissue fragments were digested in the same buffer in the presence of collagenase (1 mg/ml; c5138, Sigma) with gentle shaking for ∼1 h at 37 °C, and the cell suspension filtered through a 200-μm nylon mesh and washed three times in Krebs buffer. The cells were cultured for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% LPDS, 10 nm 20,25-DAC, [3H]desmosterol (1 nmol, 1.6 Ci/mmol), and [14C]cholesterol (20 nmol, 0.05 Ci/mmol), after which the cell-associated dissociations per minute (dpm) were similar for both labels. Caveolar membranes were immunoisolated essentially as described in Refs. 29Ortegren U. Karlsson M. Blazic N. Blomqvist M. Nystrom F.H. Gustavsson J. Fredman P. Stralfors P. Eur. J.

Briefly, cells resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA were broken by 10 strokes with a glass Teflon Dounce and the material centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 500 mm Na2CO3, pH 11, including CLAP, and sonicated three times for 20 s at full power using a MSE Soniprep 150 sonicator. The homogenate was transferred to a SW40 tube and adjusted to 45% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 90% sucrose in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA and CLAP. The sample was overlaid with 4 ml of 35 and 5% sucrose in the same buffer. After centrifugation (39,000 × g for 24 h at 4 °C with an SW40 rotor) the caveolae-enriched membrane fraction at the 5–35% sucrose interphase (fraction 3) was collected. This fraction was divided into two and incubated overnight with or without Cav1 Ab (clone 2234), followed by a 1-h incubation with Dynal beads (Dynal Biotech) linked to anti-mouse IgG and washes according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control pull-down without Cav1 antibodies contained ∼10% of [3H] and [14C] radioactivity compared with the specific pull-down and was subtracted. The pull-down contained on average 1.6% [14C]cholesterol and 0.9% [3H]desmosterol found in fraction 3. The relative amount of [3H]desmosterol compared with [14C]cholesterol in the same pull-down was determined. Intensity Analysis of Cav1-GFP Structures—Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) images were acquired using an Olympus IX-71 microscope with a PLAPON TIRFM ×60/1.45 objective and deconvolved using the blind-deconvolution wizard of Huygens® Essential. Cells were kept at 37 °C in CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen). Cav1-GFP containing structures were automatically detected by defining potential dot regions (31Otsu N. IEEE Trans. Systems Man Cybernetics. 1979; 9: 62-66Crossref Google Scholar) and then finding pixels with a higher intensity than their 8-pixel neighborhood. Each dot was assumed to approximate a three-dimensional normal distribution, with pixel intensity considered as the third dimension. Total dot intensity was defined by the volume under this multivariate normal distribution. If two or more dots overlapped, they were treated as a mixture distribution of multivariate normal distributions. Each dot had six parameters (location x, location y, covariance matrix with three parameters and volume) that were estimated by a genetic algorithm (32Tohka J. Krestyannikov E. Dinov I.D. MacKenize Graham A. Shattuck D.W. Ruotsalainen U. Toga A.W. IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging. 2007; 26: 696-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Dot intensities per cell were plotted in a histogram. Peaks in the intensity histogram were considered to represent different pools of caveolar structures (33Pelkmans L. Zerial M. Nature. 2005; 436: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The histograms were cropped, leaving only the first three peaks, and a mixture distribution of three univariate Gaussian distributions was fitted with the algorithm (32Tohka J. Krestyannikov E. Dinov I.D. MacKenize Graham A. Shattuck D.W. Ruotsalainen U. Toga A.W. IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging. 2007; 26: 696-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The distance between the first and the third peak in each histogram was normalized by multiplication to convert the data from different cells and experiments to the same scale. Quantification Cav1-GFP Mobility—Cav1-GFP mobility was analyzed using the same principle as in Ref. 34Tagawa A. Mezzacasa A. Hayer A. Longatti A. Pelkmans L. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar. HeLa Cav1-GFP cells were imaged by TIRFM using 67 × 67-nm sampling and an exposure time of 500 ms. Per condition at least 20 separate 1-min movies were acquired containing 4 frames per minute. Images were deconvolved as described above and Pearson correlation was calculated for succeeding frames (15-s interval). Endocytosis Assays—The internalization of BODIPY-lactosylceramide (LacCer, d-erythro isomer) was analyzed essentially as in Ref. 3Singh R.D. Puri V. Valiyaveettil J.T. Marks D.L. Bittman R. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3254-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar. Briefly, fibroblasts were incubated with 5 μm BODIPY-FL5-LacCer·BSA complex in Earle's minimal essential medium for 30 min at 0 °C and, after imaging for labeling efficiency, incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Uninternalized label was removed from the PM by washing the cells 6 × 10 min with 5% BSA in Earle's minimal essential medium at 0 °C. Images were acquired using an inverted Olympus IX-71 microscope equipped with a ×60 water objective (N.A. 1.2), 1 pixel = 232 × 232 nm. Fluorescence intensity per cellular area was determined after background subtraction using a rolling ball radius of 5 pixels (Image J). Samples with a similar labeling efficiency were used for quantification. To analyze Tfn or dextran uptake, HeLa cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml of AF568-Tfn (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by 5 min at 37 °C, or with 1 mg/ml of AF488-dextran (10,000 Mr; Molecular Probes) for 20 min at 37 °C, prior to acid-stripping as described (35Singh R.D. Holicky E.L. Cheng Z.J. Kim S.Y. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Bittman R. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Control samples treated similarly but without 37 °C internalization were included for both dextran and Tfn uptake assays. Imaging and fluorescence intensity analysis were performed as described for BODIPY-LacCer. For integrin cross-linking, HeLa Cav1-GFP cells were incubated with primary and secondary Abs as described (4Upla P. Marjomaki V. Kankaanpaa P. Ivaska J. Hyypia T. Van Der Goot F.G. Heino J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The colocalization between α2β1 integrin and Cav1-GFP was analyzed from single section confocal images (Leica TCS SP2; HCX PL APO CS ×60 1.4 oil objective). Images were processed by using a rolling ball background subtraction (radius 8 pixels) and a 2 × 2 median filter (Image J). After intensity thresholding, Pearson correlation was determined (Imaris Bitplane). Electron Microscopy—For ultrastructural analysis and quantification, cells grown on glass coverslips were glutaraldehyde-fixed, osmicated, en block stained with uranyl acetate, and epon embedded as described in Ref. 36Salonen A. Vasiljeva L. Merits A. Magden J. Jokitalo E. Kaariainen L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar. Pre-embedding immunolabeling of fixed and saponin-permeabilized cells using anti-Cav1 primary antibody (C13630, BD Transduction Laboratories) was as described in Ref. 36Salonen A. Vasiljeva L. Merits A. Magden J. Jokitalo E. Kaariainen L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar. Sections were cut parallel or vertical to the coverslip, post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined using a Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope (FEI Corp.) operating at 80 kV. Images for quantification were acquired with a ES500W CCD camera (Gatan Corp.). Statistical Analysis—Data are reported as mean ± S.E. or S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel “t Test: two-sample assuming unequal variances” (or “F-test two sample for variances” where indicated). Results were considered significant if p < 0.05. Exchange of Cholesterol for Desmosterol—Cholesterol was exchanged for desmosterol by cultivating cells in the presence of LPDS and 10 nm 20,25-diazacholesterol (20,25-DAC), an inhibitor of DHCR24 (37Weiss J.F. Cravioto H. Bennett K. de Weiss E. Ransohoff J. Arch. Neurol. 1976; 33: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This treatment did not result in significant accumulation of other cholesterol precursors as detected by Ag+-HPLC (Fig. 1A, and not shown). The cells attained a free sterol composition of ∼90% desmosterol and ∼10% cholesterol in 1 week (Fig. 1, A and B; HeLa cells) to 2 weeks (primary human fibroblasts, not shown). Here we refer to such cells as desmosterol cells and cells grown similarly but in the absence of the drug as cholesterol cells. Cells grown with 20,25-DAC and FBS did not accumulate desmosterol, indicating that such cells rely on exogenously supplied cholesterol (Fig. 1B). The sterol exchange did not result in any noticeable effects on cell growth or viability. Also, we found no significant changes in total sterol or phospholipid composition (Fig. 1C) and no gross alterations in the chain length or unsaturation of major phospholipid species (Fig. 1D). To analyze PM fluidity, we measured TMA-DPH fluorescence anisotropy in HeLa cells as in Ref. 27Kuhry J.G. Duportail G. Bronner C. Laustriat G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar. Desmosterol and cholesterol cells gave identical anisotropy values (0.32 ± 0.01 versus 0.32 ± 0.01, S.D., n = 3), suggesting that the overall PM fluidity was not altered. In comparison, inhibition of sterol biosynthesis (by 10 μm lovastatin, 100 μm mevalonate in LPDS for 3 days) resulted in increased membrane fluidity, as indicated by lower anisotropy (0.29 ± 0.01). Sterol distribution as detected by filipin staining and anti-Cav1 Ab staining patterns were similar between desmosterol and cholesterol cells (Fig. 2A), as was the distribution of GFP-tagged Cav1 (Cav1-GFP) in stably overexpressing HeLa cells (Figs. 4A and 7A). To biochemically assess sterol and Cav1 compartmentalization, membranes were resolved by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 2B). This confirmed a similar distribution of sterols and Cav1 in desmosterol and cholesterol cells. Moreover, the total amount of Cav1 remained similar (in HeLa cells, Fig. 2C, and in fibroblasts, not shown). Together, these results indicate that exchanging cholesterol for desmosterol did not impair cell viability, general membrane integrity, or composition of other major membrane lipids, nor the gross compartmentalization of sterols or Cav1.FIGURE 4Sterol exchange alters the Cav1 composition of caveolae. A, HeLa Cav1-GFP cells were imaged by TIRFM. Bar, 10 μm. B, the Cav1-GFP structures were automatically detected. Bar, 1.25 μm. C, intensities of the detected Cav1-GFP structures were plotted in a histogram (∼300 structures from a single cell) and a mixture distribution of three univariate Gaussian distributions was fitted. Exemplary histograms from one cholesterol and one desmosterol cell are shown. The width of the first Gaussian peak (double headed arrow) correlates to the number of Cav1-GFP molecules in individual caveolae. Black bars indicate the variance in the fluorescence intensities of the first Gaussian peaks (±S.E., n = 12 cells; *, p < 0.0001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7Sterol exchange results in reduced caveolar localization of cross-linked integrins but increased Cav1 Tyr14 phosphorylation.

Merged confocal images (colocalization; white) of Ab-clustered α2-integrins (anti-α2 Ab; red) in HeLa Cav1-GFP cells (Cav1; green) at 0 min (upper panel) and 15 min (lower panel) at 37 °C. Colocalization of α2β1 integrin with Cav1-GFP was analyzed by Pearson correlation from confocal sections (±S.E.; n > 20 images; *, p < 0.02). B, Cav1 Tyr14 phosphorylation after integrin cross-linking was determined by Western blotting from 20 μg of cellular protein, followed by quantification of signal intensity (±S.E.; n = 3; *, p = 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sterol C24 Double Bond Reduces Affinity for Caveolae—To analyze the association of cholesterol and desmosterol with caveolar membranes, primary rat adipocytes were labeled for 2 days with both [3H]desmosterol and [14C]cholesterol in the presence of 10 nm 20,25-DAC (to prevent the conversion of [3H]desmosterol). Cells were then disrupted by sonication and the caveolae-enriched membrane fraction isolated without detergents as described (Fig. 3A) (29Ortegren U. Karlsson M. Blazic N. Blomqvist M. Nystrom F.H.

We found that both [3H]desmosterol and [14C]cholesterol specifically precipitated with Cav1 (Fig. 3B).

https://openalex.org/W2080476179,"In recent years crystal structures of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a), stabilized in various conformations with nucleotide and phosphate analogs, have been obtained. However, structural analysis of mutant forms would also be valuable to address key mechanistic aspects. We have worked out a procedure for affinity purification of SERCA1a heterologously expressed in yeast cells, producing sufficient amounts for crystallization and biophysical studies. We present here the crystal structures of two mutant forms, D351A and P312A, to address the issue whether the profound functional changes seen for these mutants are caused by major structural changes. We find that the structure of P312A with ADP and AlF−4 bound (3.5-Å resolution) and D351A with AMPPCP or ATP bound (3.4- and 3.7-Å resolution, respectively) deviate only slightly from the complexes formed with that of wild-type ATPase. ATP affinity of the D351A mutant was very high, whereas the affinity for cytosolic Ca2+ was similar to that of the wild type. We conclude from an analysis of data that the extraordinary affinity of the D351A mutant for ATP is caused by the electrostatic effects of charge removal and not by a conformational change. P312A exhibits a profound slowing of the Ca2+-translocating Ca2E1P→E2P transition, which seems to be due to a stabilization of Ca2E1P rather than a destabilization of E2P. This can be accounted for by the strain that the Pro residue induces in the straight M4 helix of the wild type, which is removed upon the replacement of Pro312 with alanine in P312A.

SERCA belongs to the family of P-type ATPases characterized by the formation during the catalytic cycle of an energy-rich covalent aspartyl-phosphorylated intermediate. The cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is coupled with Ca2+/H+ exchange through conformational changes between the so-called “E1” and “E2” forms in phosphorylated and dephosphorylated states. Ca2+ binding from the cytoplasmic side in the E1 form is required for phosphorylation of the enzyme from ATP, whereas the dephosphorylation occurs subsequently to the luminal release of Ca2+ from E2P and leads to proton countertransport (Scheme 1). Key residues involved in the binding of Ca2+ and ATP (8Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 9Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H.

The membrane-embedded region to which these cytosolic domains are linked is organized in 10 transmembrane spans, M1-M10, which accommodate the Ca2+ binding sites, nested in internal loops or kinks of M4 and M6 (23Toyoshima C.

The formation of a compact Ca2+-occluding Ca2E1P state ensures coupling between phosphoryl transfer and vectorial Ca2+ transport (21Sørensen T.L. Møller J.V. Nissen P.

The phosphorylation/Ca2+ occlusion step is followed by a major conformational rearrangement involving both the cytosolic and the transmembrane regions, resulting in the Ca2E1P→E2P transition (cf. Scheme 1), in which the A domain rotates (24Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 25Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and the membrane domains separate, allowing release of Ca2+ toward the lumen (27Olesen C. Picard M. Winther A.M. Gyrup C. Morth J.P. Oxvig C. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Many structural details correlate well with the results of functional studies of mutants with changes to specific residues, thus providing a sound basis for the use of site-directed mutagenesis to obtain further insight into how the long range communications between the cytoplasmic and membranous parts of the protein are brought about. The analysis of the functional consequences of mutations has reached a level where it encompasses rapid kinetic quench-flow studies of the partial reaction steps (28Sørensen T.L. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and most recently also biophysical measurements of conformational transitions by fluorescence changes, made feasible by large scale expression in yeast (15Lenoir G.

Picard M. le Maire M. Champeil P. Falson P. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5261-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A number of mutations appear to accelerate or block partial reactions in the functional cycle and displace E1-E2 and/or E1P-E2P equilibria. However, in the absence of direct structural information the fundamental question arises whether the effect of a given mutation is caused by the displacement of the equilibrium between already existing conformations in the wild-type enzyme, or whether it is the result of induction of local or global structural changes not seen in the wild type. To deal with this question there is a need for an analysis of the structures of the mutant proteins. So far, the success in three-dimensional crystallization of Ca2+-ATPase, as well as other eukaryotic membrane proteins like cytochrome oxidase (30Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar), bovine rhodopsin (31Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar), and aquaporins (32Sui H. Han B.G. Lee J.K. Walian P. Jap B.K. Nature. 2001; 414: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), has to a large extent been dependent on their purification in relatively large amounts from natural sources, enabling optimization of the conditions for obtaining well diffracting protein crystals (33Sørensen T.L. Olesen C. Jensen A.M. Møller J.V. Nissen P. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 124: 704-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This fortunate situation does not exist for Ca2+-ATPase mutants or for the majority of membrane proteins from mammalian sources, which, however, can be prepared by recombinant expression systems. The first reports on successful crystal structure determination of eukaryotic membrane proteins, purified from an overexpression host (yeast), came in 2005 (SERCA1a (34Jidenko M. Nielsen R.C. Sørensen T.L. Møller J.V. le Maire M. Nissen P. Jaxel C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11687-11691Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the shaker K+ channel protein (35Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1811) Google Scholar)). With a new procedure for affinity purification of SERCA1a heterologously expressed in yeast cells (36Jidenko M. Lenoir G. Fuentes J.M. le Maire M. Jaxel C. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 48: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we were able to produce sufficient amounts, in the milligrams range, of SERCA1a for crystallization and biophysical studies (34Jidenko M. Nielsen R.C. Sørensen T.L. Møller J.V. le Maire M. Nissen P. Jaxel C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11687-11691Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Extending this technique to Ca2+-ATPase mutants would open the possibility of linking, in a more definitive way than before, the structural data obtained by x-ray diffraction with those arising from the functional analysis of Ca2+-ATPase mutants, to address key functional aspects of the Ca2+ transport mechanism. To explore these possibilities, we have focused on two mutants, D351A and P312A, which have been selected for crystallization due to their important functional characteristics as previously determined in the mammalian COS cell expression system (12Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 16Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. MacLennan D.H. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25227-25236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Both of these mutations prevent the ATPase from hydrolyzing ATP and transporting Ca2+. In mutant D351A the negatively charged side chain of the conserved aspartate, constituting the phosphorylation site in the P-domain, has been removed, resulting in an inability of the mutant enzyme to undergo phosphorylation (12Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that ATP and MgATP bind with much higher apparent affinity to D351A as compared with the wild-type enzyme (37McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. MacLennan D.H. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25227-25236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), leading to the hypothesis that in the wild type a significant electrostatic repulsion exists between the γ-phosphate of ATP and the negative charge of Asp351, which was considered to be overcome by highly favorable interactions of ATP with other residues. This hypothesis would also explain the observation of an enhanced nucleotide protection against proteolysis in the D351A mutant (38Ma H. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28938-28943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, an alternative possibility could be that the high affinity state is the result of a particular structure of the mutant, induced by the mutation per se, and as such irrelevant to the function of the wild-type enzyme. The other mutant, P312A, is characterized by an extremely slow transition from the ADP-sensitive Ca2E1P phosphoenzyme intermediate to the ADP-insensitive E2P state, the step that releases the Ca2+ ions toward the lumen (16Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pro312 is located at the border of the unwound part of transmembrane segment M4, next to the 308PEGL motif containing the Ca2+ binding residue Glu309, and the question here is also whether the block of Ca2E1P→E2P reflects an abnormal structure of the mutant or different kinetic properties of the Ca2E1P→E2P transition. In this communication we have addressed these questions by determining the crystal structure of the above mutants with bound nucleotide. The large scale expression in the yeast system of the D351A mutant has also been utilized to investigate by fluorescence measurements whether the change induced by the mutations has any consequences for the long range communication between the Ca2+ binding sites and the phosphorylation site. As will be shown this approach, in conjunction with data obtained by previously established methodology, has allowed us to obtain an improved understanding of the mechanistic roles of Asp351 and Pro312 in ATPase function. Chemicals—All chemical products were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless specified otherwise. Restriction and modification enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Ozyme, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France). High activity bovine thrombin was from Calbiochem (VWR International, Fontenay sous Bois, France), the streptavidin-Sepharose™ High Performance was purchased from GE Healthcare Biosciences AB (Orsay, France). All products for yeast and bacteria cultures were purchased from Difco (BD Biosciences, Le Pont de Claix, France). 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) was from Anatrace (Maumee, OH) and octaethylene glycol mono-n-dodecyl ether (C12E8) was purchased from Nikkol Chemical (Tokyo, Japan). Plasmid Constructions—SERCA1a mutants (SERCA1amut) in pMT2 vector (D351A) or p91023 (P312A) were the ones previously used for expression in COS cells (16Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. MacLennan D.H. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25227-25236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The yeast expression plasmid pYeDP60-SERCA1a-BAD was as previously described (36Jidenko M. Lenoir G. Fuentes J.M. le Maire M. Jaxel C. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 48: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Each plasmid was digested by EcoRI (cut on the plasmid upstream the cDNA of SERCA1a) and BssHII (internal site at +2038 in SERCA1a). Fragments were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The 2.1-kb EcoRI-BssHII fragment of SERCA1amut cDNA containing the mutation was subcloned in the opened EcoRI-BssHII pYeDP60-SERCA1a-BAD, replacing the corresponding WT SERCA1a cDNA. To keep the same environment between the EcoRI site and the ATG, which is important for expression in yeast, another step of subcloning was performed: pYeDP60-SERCA1a-BAD and new pYeDP60 plasmids containing SERCA1amut-BAD cDNA were digested by KpnI (internal site at +640 in SERCA1a and at +3304 in pYeDP60). After purification, the 2.76-kb KpnI fragment containing the mutation was ligated to KpnI-cleaved pYeDP60 (using an NEB Quick ligation kit, Ozyme, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France) to obtain the pYeDP60-SERCA1amut-BAD containing the D351A or P312A mutation. The constructions were checked by sequencing. These plasmids were transformed and amplified in Escherichia coli JM109. Plasmids DNA were purified using a QIAprep 8 Turbo Miniprep kit (Qiagen). Yeast Transformation—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain W303.1b/Gal4 (a, leu2, his3, trp1::TRP1-GAL10-GAL4, ura3, ade2-1, canr, cir+) was the same as previously described (39Lenoir G. Menguy T. Corre F. Montigny C. Pedersen P.A. Thines D. le Maire M. Falson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1560: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Transformation was performed according to the lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/PEG method (40Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Yeast Culture, Mutant Expression, and Preparation of Membrane Fractions—Growth conditions and criteria for expression of the mutants were the same as previously published for native SERCA1a expressed in yeast (36Jidenko M. Lenoir G. Fuentes J.M. le Maire M. Jaxel C. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 48: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were broken with glass beads. For membrane preparation by differential centrifugation (36Jidenko M. Lenoir G. Fuentes J.M. le Maire M. Jaxel C. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 48: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 39Lenoir G. Menguy T. Corre F. Montigny C. Pedersen P.A. Thines D. le Maire M. Falson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1560: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the P3 pellet, corresponding to the light membrane fraction (where the level of SERCA1a activity is highest), was finally suspended in Hepes-sucrose buffer (20 mm Hepes-Tris (pH 7.5), 0.3 m sucrose, 0.1 mm CaCl2) at a final volume corresponding to 0.5 ml/g of the initial yeast pellet). From 1 liter of culture, 40 g of yeast was obtained and from the P3 pellet, 250 mg of membrane proteins was obtained with a SERCA1a (wild type or mutants) content of ∼1% as estimated by Western blot analysis using an anti-SERCA1a antibody (39Lenoir G. Menguy T. Corre F. Montigny C. Pedersen P.A. Thines D. le Maire M. Falson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1560: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). SR-SERCA1a from rabbit muscle, used as a standard for protein estimation, was prepared as previously described (41Champeil P. Guillain F. Venien C. Gingold M.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Purification of the Mutants by Streptavidin-Agarose Chromatography—The light membrane fraction (“P3” fraction), suspended in the Hepes-sucrose buffer, was first solubilized by DDM (6 mg/ml) at a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7), 0.1 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After stirring for 2.5 h at room temperature, non-solubilized material was pelleted by centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. All subsequent steps (unless otherwise specified) were then performed in a cold room. The supernatant after the centrifugation step was mixed with streptavidin-Sepharose™ High Performance resin at a ratio of 40:1 (v/v), using typically 1 ml of resin per 0.4 mg of SERCA1a (corresponding to 40 ml of solubilized proteins with an average solubilization yield of 50%), and stirred gently overnight at 4 °C. The suspension was then loaded onto a number of 11 × 100 mm columns (BioSepra) and washed, first with a “high salt” buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7), 1 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.05% DDM, buffer:resin, 12:1 (v/v)), and then with a “low salt” KCl buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7), 50 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.05% DDM, buffer:resin, 12:1 (v/v)). All the resin in the columns was resuspended in the “low salt” KCl buffer (buffer:resin, 1:1 (v/v)) and introduced into a larger column (40 × 200 mm, BioSepra, MA) and thrombin was added (20 units of thrombin/ml of resin). The column was sealed and placed on a wheel, and the mixture was stirred gently at room temperature for 30 min, followed by a second addition of thrombin and stirring of the mixture for another 30 min. To inactivate thrombin, 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was then added, and the proteolytically cleaved SERCA1a proteins eluted from the column by three successive additions of the KCl buffer (buffer:resin, 1:1 (v/v)). The eluted fractions containing the Ca2+-ATPase (∼2 mg of protein with a Ca2+-ATPase content of ∼40%, as evidenced by gel electrophoresis) were pooled, and the glycerol concentration increased to 40% before freezing the samples in nitrogen and storage at -80 °C. HPLC Gel Filtration—For crystallization experiments, DDM was exchanged with C12E8 by size-exclusion chromatography, an additional step that also led to improvement of the purity of the Ca2+-ATPase preparation. For this, the pool of SERCA1a mutant proteins (typically 30 ml) was first concentrated on Centricon Ultracel-YM 30 (Amicon, Millipore, Bedford, MA) until the volume was smaller than 500 μl. The concentrate was applied at 0.5 ml/min to a silica gel-filtration column (0.78 cm × 30 cm TosoHaas TSK-gel G3000SWXL column, Sigma-Aldrich), mounted on a Gold HPLC System (Beckman Coulter, Roissy CDG, France), and equilibrated with 100 mm MOPS (pH 6.8), 80 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 15% sucrose, and 0.5 mg/ml C12E8. The eluted fractions containing the Ca2+-ATPase peak were pooled (∼1.5 ml) and concentrated on Centricon-30 to a final volume of ∼50 μl, resulting in a final protein concentration of 8-10 mg/ml and a concentration of C12E8 estimated to be ∼10-12 mg/ml on the basis of previous C12E8 binding data (42Møller J.V. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18659-18672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Crystallization—For crystallization, the concentrated, delipidated, and C12E8-solubilized Ca2+-ATPase was supplemented with phospholipids (DOPC), to reach a C12E8: DOPC ratio of 3:1 (w/w). This was done by adding the sample to a centrifuge tube that had been deposited with a thin layer of N2-dried DOPC, vortexing the tube, and storing it overnight at 4 °C. The next day the sample often exhibited a slight haziness, arising from non-solubilized lipids, in which case it was clarified by addition of a slight amount of C12E8 stock solution, until having a clear solution. In addition the sample was subjected to centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 20 min to remove aggregated (inactive) protein, arising during the preparation. Agents were then added to induce the formation of ATPase crystals in the presence of 10 mm Ca2+ together with either 1 mm ATP, AMP-PCP, or ADP together with 1 mm AlF−4 (as a structural analogue of phosphate). An initial 96 conditions of PEG/salt screening (33Sørensen T.L. Olesen C. Jensen A.M. Møller J.V. Nissen P. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 124: 704-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were performed using a liquid-handling Mosquito robot (TTP Labtech, Cambridge UK), which distributed 100- + 100-nl drops of protein and crystallization buffer for equilibration with 100 μl of well solution. After a few hours (up to 2 days) at 19 °C, crystals started to appear. The best crystals were obtained at 10% sucrose, 12% PEG 2000 monomethyl ether, 0.2 m NaOAc, and 3% tert-butanol or 6% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol for P312A; and 7% PEG 6000, 0.2 m Na2C3H2O4, and 6% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol for D351A. These conditions were subjected to further grid screen optimization with 1- + 1-μl hanging drops equilibrating against 450 μl of well solution at 19 °C. After 1 week suitable crystals were cryoprotected (2 μl of 40% PEG 4000 or 5 μl of 50% sucrose added to the drop) and picked up in nylon-fiber loops (Hampton Research, Riverside, CA) mounted on 18-mm metal pins. Crystals were flash-cooled and stored in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at the Swiss Light Source (for P312A mutant) or at the Berliner Elektronen Speicher Synchrotron (for the D351A mutant) beamlines. The crystals diffracted anisotropically, to 3.4 Å for the D351A crystals and to 3.5 Å for the P312A crystals. Crystallographic data were processed and scaled by using the XDS package (43Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). An unbiased difference Fourier map using experimental Fobs(SERCA1a P312A mutant) - Fobs(SERCA1a D351A mutant) difference coefficients was calculated to reveal the structural differences between"
https://openalex.org/W2118158887,"We have described the scaffolding protein FHL2 as a component of focal adhesion structures, to which it is recruited via binding to both alpha- or beta-integrin subunits. Using mesenchymal stem cells from wild-type and FHL2-knockout mice, we show here that inactivation of FHL2 leads to impaired assembly of extracellular matrix proteins on the cell surface and to impaired bundling of focal adhesions. Both altered properties can be restored by reexpression of recombinant FHL2 protein in FHL2-null cells. Molecular analysis of integrin-mediated signaling revealed a higher phosphorylation of FAK at tyrosine 925 in FHL2-knockout cells compared to their wild-type counterpart. Consequently, the activation of the mitogenic kinase ERK was more pronounced in knockout cells on cell adhesion. The growth factor-induced activation of ERK, however, was not altered. The perturbed organization of extracellular matrix on FHL2-null cells was improved when the increased activation of MAPK was inhibited. Our findings point to a role of FHL2 in bundling of focal adhesion structures, in integrin-mediated ERK activation, and subsequently in proper allocation of matrix proteins on the cell surface."

The high efficiency is due in part to DNA condensation and protection against degradation in the reconstituted chromatin, as well as its ability to interact with high affinity with the importin proteins of the cellular nuclear import machinery.

https://openalex.org/W2042966742,"In our search for compounds that up-regulate the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q (CoQ), we discovered that irradiation of CoQ with ultraviolet light results in the formation of a number of compounds that influence the synthesis of mevalonate pathway lipids by HepG2 cells. Among the compounds that potently stimulated CoQ synthesis while inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, derivatives of CoQ containing 1–4 epoxide moieties in their polyisoprenoid side chains were identified. Subsequently, chemical epoxidation of all-trans-polyprenols of different lengths revealed that the shorter farnesol and geranylgeraniol derivatives were without effect, whereas the longer derivatives of solanesol enhanced CoQ and markedly reduced cholesterol biosynthesis. In contrast, none of the modified trans-trans-poly-cis-polyprenols exerted noticeable effects. Tocotrienol epoxides were especially potent in our system; those with one epoxide moiety in the side-chain generally up-regulated CoQ biosynthesis by 200–300%, whereas those with two such moieties also decreased cholesterol synthesis by 50–90%. Prolonged treatment of HepG2 cells with tocotrienol epoxides for 26 days elevated their content of CoQ by 30%. In addition, the levels of mRNA encoding enzymes involved in CoQ biosynthesis were also elevated by the tocotrienol epoxides. The site of inhibition of cholesterol synthesis was shown to be oxidosqualene cyclase.

In addition to the roles it plays in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and as the only lipid-soluble antioxidant synthesized endogenously, CoQ also participates in extramitochondrial electron transport, functional modification of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins, regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and modulation of the levels of certain receptors on the surface of blood monocytes (1Ernster L.

Moreover, diseases such as cardiomyopathy, muscle degeneration, and cancer of the liver are associated with significantly lower tissue levels of CoQ (6Littarru G.P. Battino M. Folkers K. Cadenas E. Packer L. Handbook of Antioxidants. Marcel Dekker, New York1996: 203-239Google Scholar). In addition, genetic disorders characterized by impaired biosynthesis of CoQ involve serious metabolic disturbances that can be partially counteracted by dietary supplementation (7Rotig A. Appelkvist E.L. Geromel V. Chretien D. Kadhom N. Edery P. Lebideau M. Dallner G. Munnich A. Ernster L. Rustin P. Lancet. 2000; 356: 391-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 8Rustin P. Munnich A. Rotig A. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Under such conditions, elevating tissue levels of CoQ would be beneficial.The biosynthesis of cholesterol is influenced by a number of endogenous metabolites, including oxysterols, squalene oxide, farnesol, and its derivatives, geranylgeraniol, prenyl phosphates, and sterols, that activate meiosis (9Edwards P.A. Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). It appears highly probable that as yet unidentified metabolites also regulate CoQ biosynthesis. For instance, in connection with diseases in which oxidative stress is a contributing factor, such as Alzheimer and prion diseases, precarcinogenic conditions, and diabetes, biosynthesis of CoQ is up-regulated (10Turunen M. Olsson J. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1660: 171-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar).The relatively short half-life of CoQ in tissues, varying between 50 and 125 h, leads to the formation of significant amounts of metabolites, some of which may be regulators of the biosynthesis of this lipid (11Thelin A. Schedin S. Dallner G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 118-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Degradation products isolated from the urine and feces of rats and guinea pigs contain an intact and fully substituted ring together with a short, carboxylated side chain. These compounds are subject to glucuronidation or phosphorylation prior to excretion into the bile and urine, respectively (12Nakamura T. Ohno T. Hamamura K. Sato T. Biofactors. 1999; 9: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Bentinger M. Dallner G. Chojnacki T. Swiezewska E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, various breakdown products of CoQ may be produced in association with UV irradiation and lipid peroxidation. Thus, UV irradiation of skin rapidly reduces its content of CoQ, whereas such irradiation of crystals of this lipid yields a number of degradation products (14Morimoto H. Imada I. Goto G. Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1970; 735: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 15Podda M. Traber M.G. Weber C. Yan L.J. Packer L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In its reduced form, CoQ in submitochondrial particles and liposomes is protected from lipid peroxidation, but the oxidized form is subject to extensive breakdown to more polar, as yet unidentified compounds (16Forsmark-Andree P. Lee C.P. Dallner G. Ernster L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis is of considerable medical interest, and, at present, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, the statins, are employed almost exclusively for this purpose. One drawback of statin treatment is that it also interferes with CoQ synthesis and protein isoprenylation (17Liao J.K. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2005; 16: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 18Littarru G.P. Langsjoen P. Mitochondrion. 2007; 7: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, effective inhibition of cholesterol synthesis downstream from the branch point represented by farnesyl-PP synthase might prove to be highly beneficial.In the present investigation, compounds containing an epoxidated side chain, obtained by UV irradiation of CoQ, are shown to exert profound effects on the biosynthesis of CoQ and cholesterol. Furthermore, all-trans-polyisoprenes epoxidated chemically influence the biosynthesis of lipid products of the mevalonate pathway in tissue culture. By varying the number of epoxide moieties on the polyisoprene chain, differential effects on CoQ and cholesterol synthesis can be achieved.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—α-Unsaturated polyprenols were prepared from Sorbus suecica, as described previously (19Chojnacki T. Vogtman T. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1984; 31: 115-126PubMed Google Scholar). Dolichol-11 was prepared by saturation of the α-terminal isoprene residue of plant undecaprenol (20Mankowski T. Jankowski W. Chojnacki T. Franke P. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2125-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Dolichol-18 was isolated from human liver (21Ekstrom T.J. Chojnacki T. Dallner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10460-10468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (R,S)-5-[3H]Mevalonolactone was synthesized employing [3H]sodium borohydride (15 Ci/mmol; GE Healthcare) as described by Keller (22Keller R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12053-12059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Lanosterol was synthesized from [3H]mevalonate according to Downs et al. (23Downs S.M. Ruan B. Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Tocotrienols were purchased from Davos Life Sciences Pte. Ltd. (Singapore). All other chemicals were procured from Sigma.For purposes of epoxidation, the various lipids were dissolved in dichloromethane and then mixed with 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (77%) dissolved in dichloromethane to obtain a 1:2 molar ratio of lipid to 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (24Duitsman P.K. Barua A.B. Becker B. Olson J.A. Int. J. Vitam. Nutr. Res. 1999; 69: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Following incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the solvent was removed by evaporation under nitrogen, and the residue was redissolved in hexane/diethyl ether (4:1). Subsequently, the individual epoxides were separated by column chromatography on silica gel 60 (230–400 mesh) utilizing a gradient from hexane to an equal mixture of hexane and diethyl ether for elution. The individual fractions thus obtained were purified further on a RP-18 column (LiCroprep 40–63 μm; Merck) with methanol/acetone (3:1) as the eluent.Solanesyl-PP was prepared according to Popjak et al. (25Popjak G. Cornforth J.W. Cornforth R.H. Ryhage R. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 56-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polyprenols were acetylated by treatment with acetic acid anhydride/pyridine (1:1) at room temperature for 1 h, and the resulting products were isolated by silica chromatography. Phtalimidation of solanesol was performed according to Sen and Roach (26Sen S.E. Roach S.L. Synthesis. 1995; 1995: 756-758Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar).UV Irradiation and Separation of Products—To obtain compounds formed in response to UV irradiation, CoQ10 dissolved in ethanol/water (9:1) (0.4 mg/ml) was irradiated at 190–300 nm, 500 microwatts/cm2 for 30 min. Following evaporation of the solvents, the residue was dissolved in hexane and applied to a silica gel column, which was then eluted with a gradient starting from 100% hexane and finishing with hexane/diethyl ether (1:2).Cell Cultures—Human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells were cultured in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 1 g of glucose/100 ml, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). When 70% confluence was reached, the medium was changed, and the compounds to be investigated were added in 50–100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide to give a final concentration of 2 μm or, in the case of tocotrienols, 5 μm. Twenty-four hours later, 0.5 mCi of [3H]mevalonate (3.25 Ci/mmol) was added, and incubation continued for an additional 8 h. When the substrate was [3H]lanosterol (0.28 Ci/mmol), the amount added was 5 μCi. Finally, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and stored at -20 °C for later analysis.Extraction and Chromatography of Lipids—Lipids were extracted from cells with chloroform/methanol/water (1:1:0.3) at 37 °C for 1 h with magnetic stirring (27Ericsson J. Runquist M. Thelin A. Andersson M. Chojnacki T. Dallner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 832-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracts thus obtained were adjusted to achieve a final chloroform/methanol/water ratio of 3:2:1, and complete phase separation was then accomplished by centrifugation. The lower chloroform phase was removed and evaporated to dryness under a flow of nitrogen, and the residue was subsequently redissolved in chloroform. These solutions were placed onto a silica column (50 mg/1.5 ml; Extract-Clean; Alltech, Deerfield, IL) and thereafter eluted with 6 ml of chloroform. After evaporation of the solvents, the neutral lipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1).For analysis of cholesterol, cholesterol metabolites, squalene, and CoQ, the samples were subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using a Supelcosil LC-18 column (3 μm, 4.0 × 75 mm) equipped with an LC-18 Supelguard (Supelco) column (28Ericsson J. Thelin A. Chojnacki T. Dallner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19730-19735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For separation, a stepwise gradient involving methanol/water (9:1) in pump system A and methanol/2-propanol/hexane (2:1:1) in pump system B was employed at a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min. The gradient began at 15% solvent B, with increases to 47% after 8 min, 67% after 16 min, and 100% after 24 min. The lipids in the eluent were monitored at 210 and 275 nm with a UV detector, and labeling of radioactive products was measured with an on-line detector of radioactivity. Ergosterol and CoQ6 were used as internal standards.For the analysis of individual products following irradiation or chemical epoxidation of CoQ, this same HPLC procedure was utilized. However, HPLC analysis of tocotrienol epoxides was performed with a linear gradient starting from methanol/water at a ratio of 7:3 and ending with methanol/water at a ratio of 9:1. The flow rate was 1.1 ml/min, and the program time was 25 min.Following chemical epoxidation, the products were separated by silica gel column chromatography as described above. Subsequently, the individual fractions were analyzed on silica gel-60 plates (Merck) and HPTLC RP-18 plates (Merck), and the spots were visualized with iodine. In the case of CoQ, solanesol, squalene, vitamin K2, and polyprenols 7 and 11, the solvent system used for development was benzene/ethyl acetate (9:1) for the silica gel-60 plates and acetone/methanol (2:1) for HPTLC RP-18 plates. For farnesol and geranylgeraniol, the corresponding solvent systems were benzene/ethyl acetate (4:1) and acetone/methanol (1:1), whereas for dolichols, benzene/ethyl acetate (9:1) and 100% acetone were employed, respectively. Finally, benzene/ethyl acetate (6:1) and acetone/methanol/water (6:3:1) were utilized for the separation of tocotrienols.Mass Spectrometry and Determination of Protein—Negative ion ES spectra were recorded on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, as described earlier (13Bentinger M. Dallner G. Chojnacki T. Swiezewska E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Protein was determined with the bicinchoninic acid kit (Sigma).Real Time PCR—Quantitative real time PCR was employed to access levels of gene expression. For this purpose, total RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells using the Qiagen Mini RNeasy plus minikit, and 100 ng of this RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer oligonucleotides and Taq-Man reverse transcription reagents in a final volume of 20 μl. This cDNA was then mixed with SYBR Green PCR master mix and appropriate primers, and PCR analysis was performed with an ABI Prism 7300 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). The genes analyzed and the respective primers are shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Primers used for real time PCRGeneForward primera5′ to 3′Reverse primera5′ to 3′Coenzyme Q1TGGTCCACTGAAAGACATGCTCCACAACCTTGGTGTTCTGCoenzyme Q2CAACTAGCCTTGGGCTTGACATGGATCACAGGAACCCTTGFarnesyl-PP synthaseAGGTGGCTGGGTTCCCTACTCTGGTCTCCGTTCATTCTGASqualene synthaseCAGACCAGTCGCAGTTTCGCAAGGGAGATCGTTGGGAAGTCyclophilin BGGCACAGGAGGAAAGAGCATGCCCGTAGTGCTTCAGTTTGa 5′ to 3′ Open table in a new tab Statistical Analyses—The results obtained are expressed as means ± S.D., and the differences between two groups were evaluated for statistical significance by Student's t test. Differences between several groups were analyzed by analysis of variance, followed by Dunnett's test. p values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSEffects of UV Light on CoQ10—Irradiation of a solution of CoQ10 and subsequent evaporation of the solvent and separation by TLC chromatography revealed a large number of products that were more hydrophilic then the parent lipid as well as some more hydrophobic compounds. Consequently, in order to obtain fractions for more detailed analysis, the irradiated mixture was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel employing elution with a solvent mixture of increasing hydrophilicity. When aliquots of the fractions were added to cultures of HepG2 cells (a cell line derived from a human liver cancer that contains primarily CoQ with a decaprenyl side chain), six of the fractions obtained resulted in a reduced rate of incorporation of [3H]mevalonate into cholesterol (Fig. 1A). At the same time, CoQ synthesis was enhanced to various extents (Fig. 1B). As illustrated for fraction 28 (Fig. 1C), fractions collected from the silica gel column were found to contain heterogeneous and complex mixtures of compounds upon analysis by reversed-phase HPLC.Effects of Chemically Epoxidated CoQ and Solanesol—Certain peaks in the HPLC chromatograms exhibited elution times identical to derivatives of CoQ containing 1–4 epoxide moieties (prepared by treating CoQ10 with 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) and could be separated efficiently by column chromatography on silica gel, followed by chromatography on C18 HPTLC plates (Fig. 2A). Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed that the molecular masses of the compounds thus obtained were those of CoQ10 plus 16, 32, 48, and 64 daltons, respectively. Furthermore, although the side chain contained one or more epoxide moieties, spectroscopic investigation demonstrated that the quinone ring had not been modified. Previous studies have also concluded that various epoxidated derivatives are produced by UV irradiation of CoQ (14Morimoto H. Imada I. Goto G. Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1970; 735: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Chemical epoxidation of CoQ10 and solanesol and the effects of these epoxide derivatives on cholesterol and CoQ synthesis. A, CoQ10 was epoxidated with 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in dichloromethane, the products were separated by chromatography on silica gel, and the individual fractions thus collected were analyzed by chromatography on silica gel-60 plates using acetone/methanol (2:1) as the developing solvent system.

B, HepG2 cells were cultured in the presence of derivatives of CoQ containing 1–4 epoxide moieties or of solanesol with 1–4 epoxide moieties at a final concentration of 2 μm. After 24 h of treatment, the culture medium was supplemented with 0.5 mCi of [3H]mevalonate, and 8 h later, the cells were harvested by trypsinization, and their lipids were extracted and analyzed by HPLC using on-line detection of radioactivity.

Cholesterol synthesis by HepG2 cells was not influenced by the presence of derivatives of CoQ with one or two epoxide moieties in the culture medium but was potently reduced by derivatives containing three or four such moieties (Fig. 2B). In contrast, biosynthesis of CoQ was enhanced by all four types of derivatives. Since our analyses showed that only the polyisoprenoid side chain is modified in these derivatives, we also tested the effects of the corresponding epoxides of solanesol, the side chain of CoQ9. Solanesol containing 1–4 epoxide moieties elevated CoQ synthesis while practically eliminating cholesterol synthesis.Effects of Epoxidated Derivatives of Various Poly-cis- and All-trans-polyisoprenoids—Poly-cis-α-unsaturated polyprenols constitute the majority of isoprenoid lipids that occur naturally, particularly in plants, whereas in animal tissues, α-saturated dolichols are predominant. Two α-unsaturated polyprenols (7 and 11 isoprene units) and two α-saturated polyprenols (11 and 18 isoprene units) were epoxidated, and these derivatives were found to exert only minor effects on the biosynthesis of cholesterol and CoQ by HepG2 cells (Table 2). Epoxidated derivatives of the two short all-trans-lipids farnesol and geranylgeraniol (which were also acetylated in order to enhance their uptake into the cells) did not alter cholesterol or CoQ synthesis significantly. Epoxidated vitamin K2 inhibited cholesterol synthesis by 33% and elevated CoQ synthesis by 27%. Epoxidated squalene (possessing one or two epoxide moieties in the middle portion of the isoprenoid chain, in contrast to the natural substrate for cholesterol biosynthesis, 2,3-oxidosqualene) proved to be a potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis (70% reduction). Epoxidated derivatives of solanesol and its phosphorylated, acetylated, and phtalimidated forms produced virtually total inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and, at the same time, stimulated CoQ synthesis by ∼40%. All of the epoxidated isoprenoids were tested at a level of 2 μm, a concentration at which none of the parent nonepoxidated compounds exerted any influence on cholesterol or CoQ synthesis (not shown).TABLE 2Biosynthesis of cholesterol and CoQ by HepG2 cells in the presence of various polyisoprenoid epoxides Various polyprenols, their derivatives, vitamin K2, and squalene were epoxidated, and the resulting compounds were purified by chromatography on silica gel. The poly-cis compounds contained 1–4 epoxide moieties, farnesol and farnesyl acetate and squalene 1 and 2 epoxide moieties, geranylgeraniol and its acetate form and vitamin K2 1–3 epoxide moieties, and solanesol and its derivatives 1–4 epoxide moieties. These compounds were added to the medium of HepG2 cells at a final concentration of 2 μm, and 24 h later this medium was supplemented with [3H]mevalonate, followed by an additional 8 h of incubation, extraction of cellular lipids, and separation by HPLC with on-line detection of radioactivity in order to determine the extent of labeling of cholesterol and CoQ.

Four types of tocotrienols, with differing numbers and distributions of methyl groups on the chromanol ring, occur naturally. Employing the same procedure for epoxidation as described above, tocotrienols possessing one or two epoxide moieties were produced and subsequently isolated by chromatography.The rate of cholesterol biosynthesis by HepG2 cells was unaffected by the presence of the four nonderivatized tocotrienols themselves (Fig. 3A). Similarly, α-, β-, and γ-tocotrienols with one epoxide moiety were without effect on this rate. In sharp contrast, the δ-form with one epoxide moiety and all four tocotrienols with two epoxide moieties inhibited cholesterol synthesis potently, decreasing labeling by 56–93%.FIGURE 3Effects of tocotrienol epoxides on cholesterol and CoQ biosynthesis. α-, β-, γ-, and δ-tocotrienols were epoxidated, and the resulting compounds containing one or two epoxide moieties were then separated by column chromatography on silica gel. The parent and epoxidated products were incubated with HepG2 cells at a final concentration of 5 μm for 24 h, followed by supplementation with 0.5 mCi of [3H]mevalonate and incubation for an additional 8 h. At this point, lipids were extracted from the cells and analyzed by HPLC. A, radioactive labeling of cholesterol; B, labeling of CoQ10. The values presented are the means ± S.E.

To various and moderate extents, the parent compounds enhanced the rate of this process, whereas all of the derivatives containing one or two epoxide moieties stimulated CoQ biosynthesis 2.5–3.5-fold. Thus, certain of the tocotrienol epoxides selectively elevated CoQ synthesis, whereas others also reduced the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis by HepG2 cells.In order to investigate the toxicity of tocotrienol epoxides in our cultures, HepG2 cells were cultured in the presence of various tocotrienol epoxides at concentrations (60 μm) 12-fold higher than those routinely employed here. The morphology, growth, and lipid metabolism of the cells were not altered under these conditions, indicating a very low degree of toxicity.Effects of Prolonged Treatment—In the experiments described above, rates of biosynthesis were determined by monitoring incorporation of [3H]mevalonate. The potential physiological impact is, however, dependent on the changes in the actual amounts of CoQ. Therefore, HepG2 cells were cultured for 26 days in the presence of monoepoxy-γ-tocotrienol (which stimulates CoQ biosynthesis), during which period the cellular lipid composition was analyzed (Fig. 4). The cellular content of CoQ increased continuously, reaching a level after 26 days of treatment that was 30% higher than in untreated, control cultures. At the same time, the cellular content of cholesterol was not altered, as expected, since γ-tocotrienol with only one epoxide moiety does not influence the biosynthesis of this steroid by HepG2 cel"
https://openalex.org/W2084425537,"The proteins of the RAF family (A-RAF, B-RAF, and C-RAF) are serine/threonine kinases that play important roles in development, mature cell regulation, and cancer. Although it is widely held that their localization on membranes is an important aspect of their function, there are few data that address this aspect of their mode of action. Here, we report that each member of the RAF family exhibits a specific distribution at the level of cellular membranes and that C-RAF is the only isoform that directly targets mitochondria. We found that the RAF kinases exhibit intrinsic differences in terms of mitochondrial affinity and that C-RAF is the only isoform that binds this organelle efficiently. This affinity is conferred by the C-RAF amino-terminal domain and does not depend on the presence of RAS GTPases on the surface of mitochondria. Finally, we analyzed the consequences of C-RAF activation on mitochondria and observed that this event dramatically changes their morphology and their subcellular distribution. Our observations indicate that: (i) RAF kinases exhibit different localizations at the level of cellular membranes; (ii) C-RAF is the only isoform that directly binds mitochondria; and (iii) through its functional coupling with MEK, C-RAF regulates the shape and the cellular distribution of mitochondria.

A distinctive property of the RAF kinases is their ability to interact with cellular membranes. This localization imparts distinct properties to RAF kinases in terms of signaling; the small GTPases of the RAS family, which are membrane-anchored proteins, link RAF kinases to activated membrane receptors (5Plowman S.J. Hancock J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1746: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Compared with the cytosol, cellular membranes also contain a reduced content in phosphatases, thereby increasing the functional output of C-RAF activation when this kinase is located on membranes (6Harding A. Tian T. Westbury E. Frische E. Hancock J.F. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 869-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). RAF kinases interact not only with the plasma membrane; C-RAF is also present on the surface of mitochondria (7Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C.

Although the molecular mechanisms and the consequences of this localization are far from being uncovered, all reports to date mention that C-RAF exerts anti-apoptotic and pro-oncogenic effects at this level (9Alavi A. Hood J.D. Frausto R. Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Science. 2003; 301: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 10Jin S. Zhuo Y. Guo W. Field J. J. Biol.

The existence of target proteins for RAF kinases on the surface of mitochondria, such as the protein BAD, a “BH3-only” member of the Bcl2 family (7Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 13She Q.B. Solit D.B. Ye Q. O'Reilly K.E. Lobo J. Rosen N. Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 287-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), suggests that these kinases could control directly some important aspects of the physiology of these membrane organelles. Despite the potentially important consequences of RAF localization to cell membranes, many important questions remain to be addressed. First, do all RAF isoforms exhibit identical or distinct membrane tropism? Considering the interaction of RAF kinases with mitochondria, it remains unclear whether C-RAF is the only isoform that is present at this level. What are the structural determinants of RAF involved in mitochondrial interaction, and what type of molecules are recognized? How is the interaction of RAF kinases with mitochondria regulated? What are the consequences in terms of mitochondrial physiology? Here, we have used different experimental strategies to address these questions. Our findings reveal the specificity of RAF interaction with cellular membrane organelles and shed light on their mode of action at this level. Cell Culture and Reagents—The cell lines used in this study were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin), with the exception of HUVECs (PromoCell), which were grown in an endothelial basal growth medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), and 1 μg/ml heparin (Sigma). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) immortalized with the SV40 large T antigen (clones K2 (C-RAF−/-) and K9 (C-RAF+/+)) were obtained from C. Pritchard (University of Leicester, United Kingdom) (14Hüser M. Luckett J. Chiloeches A. Mercer K. Iwobi M. Giblett S. Sun X.M. Brown J. Marais R. Pritchard C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1940-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Mice of the FVB strain used in these studies were kept and anaesthetized according to protocols approved by the animal care and use committee at the University of Würzburg. The primers and strategy used for the construction of all RAF expression vectors, as well as the antibodies used in this study, are described in the online supplemental material. Rabbit reticulocyte lysates were synthesized and radiolabeled with [35S]Cys/Met (Redivue-Cys-Met Mix, GE Healthcare) using the TnT T7 quick-coupled transcription-translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Standard protocols were used for immunoblotting and enhanced chemiluminescence detection of the proteins (ECL kit from Pierce). Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence labeling was performed according to conventional protocols. For experiments presented in Figs. 1 and 4, cells were transfected with vectors encoding untagged versions of each RAF isoform according to standard procedures (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen). After overnight expression, we performed a prepermeabilization step; the cells were treated with digitonin (50 μg/ml) in a buffer containing 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, with protease inhibitors for 4 min on ice. The cells were subsequently fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. Pictures were acquired on a TCS SP2 confocal microscope (Leica) equipped with a 63× HCX PL APO, NA = 1.40 objective (Leica), under oil immersion. Following acquisition, the images were combined using Photoshop software (Adobe).FIGURE 4Role of mitochondrial surface proteins and of the small GTPases of the RAS family as interaction partners for C-RAF. A, mitochondrial surface proteins are required for C-RAF binding. Purified mitochondria were treated with trypsin. To monitor the selective removal of mitochondrial surface proteins by this protocol, mitochondria were analyzed by immunoblot for their content of proteins of the mitochondrial surface (Bcl-XL) or matrix (manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD)). Trypsinized mitochondria exhibit a drastically reduced ability to bind C-RAF (*, p < 0.01 compared with control (Ctrl)). B, EDTA treatment. Mitochondria were pretreated on ice with 20 mm EDTA and used later for a binding assay with C-RAF. ns, indicates no significant difference compared with control. C, mitochondrial interaction properties of the mutant C-RAF R89L. A mutant C-RAF R89L, which abolishes the interaction of C-RAF with RAS GTPases, was compared with C-RAF WT for its ability to bind mitochondria in vitro.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Videomicroscopy—HUVECs were electroporated with the mitochondrial fluorescent marker DsRed-mito (Clontech). Cells were filmed for 2 h under constant conditions of 5% CO2 and 37 °C and observed by UV-lamp using an Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with shutter-controlled illumination (Carl Zeiss) and a cooled digital charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific) using a ×40 lens. Images were processed using MetaMorph 2.0 image analysis software (Universal Imaging) and QuickTime pro 7 software (Apple Computers). Mitochondrial Purification—Mitochondria were purified from different sources according to a protocol detailed in the supplemental “Materials and Methods.” The analysis of different markers revealed that this preparation was devoid of plasma membrane (E-cadherin), nuclear (histone H3), and cytoskeletal markers (tubulin) but contained membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum (Grp98) and endosomes (Rab7) (supplemental Fig. 1A). The mitochondria retained their functionality (polarity and ability to import intrinsic preproteins) after isolation (data not shown). In Vitro Assay for Mitochondrial Binding and Import—For each mitochondrial binding reaction, we mixed 50 μg of mitochondrial proteins with 10 μl of reticulocyte lysate in a binding buffer consisting of 55 mm mannitol, 18 mm sucrose, 80 mm KOAc, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Unless stated otherwise, the samples were incubated for 15 min on ice. After a brief centrifugation, the mitochondrial pellets were rinsed, reisolated, and resuspended in sample buffer. Following separation on SDS-PAGE, radioactivity was detected with the autoradiography enhancer En3hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with ECL films (Amersham Biosciences). The results were quantified using NIH ImageJ software and presented as the percentage of input bound. To test their ability to import RAF kinases, mitochondria were incubated with RAF kinases in the same buffer with 5 mm succinate, 1 mm ATP, and 0.08 mm ADP. The import reactions were performed at 30 °C for 20 min. Following the reisolation of mitochondria, proteinase K was applied on ice for 10 min (10 μg/ml final concentration). Proteolysis was stopped with addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the samples were analyzed by autoradiography as described previously. Mitochondrial Treatments—For trypsinization, to remove proteins from the surface of mitochondria, preparations of this purified organelles were incubated with 20 μg/ml trypsin for 15 min on ice in storage buffer. Proteolysis was stopped with the addition of 500 μg/ml soybean tryptic inhibitor, and mitochondria were reisolated and used for binding assays. For EDTA treatment, mitochondria were pretreated for 5 min with 20 mm EDTA and later incubated with lysates, again in the presence of EDTA. Electron Microscopy—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 45 min with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (50 mm cacodylate, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2) at room temperature, fixed for 2 h at 4 °C with 2% OsO4 buffered with 50 mm cacodylate (pH 7.2), washed with H2O, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0.5% uranyl acetate. The cells were dehydrated, embedded in Epon 812, and ultrathin sectioned. The sections were analyzed with a Zeiss EM900 (Carl Zeiss). Anthrax Lethal Toxin (LT) Purification and Use on Cells—The two components of LT, protective antigen (PA) and lethal factor (LF), were produced and purified separately as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. The genes encoding LF and PA were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA of Bacillus anthracis strain Sterne (a gift from Patrice Boquet, Nice, France) and cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen) and pET22b (Novagen) expression plasmids. Both proteins were obtained in a His6-tagged form and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC, Chelating Fast Flow, Amersham Biosciences). PA was further purified on a mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences). Following their purification, the proteins were concentrated and dialyzed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH.7.4, 250 mm NaCl. PA and LF were simultaneously applied on cells at final concentrations of 3 and 1 μg/ml respectively, in normal culture medium. Statistics—Statistical significance was determined using a one-tailed paired Student's t test. RAF Kinases Exhibit Distinct Localizations on Cellular Membrane Organelles—Although the literature contains multiple fragmentary reports on the ability of RAF kinases to interact with cellular membranes, no comparison has yet been performed among all isoforms. To analyze simultaneously the membrane localization of all isoforms of RAF kinases, we devised a strategy intended to overcome the following technical obstacles: (i) RAF kinases exhibit non-overlapping tissue-specific expression patterns and are generally expressed at low endogenous levels; (ii) RAF kinases tend to heterodimerize under growth conditions (15Weber C.K. Slupsky J.R. Kalmes H.A. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3595-3598PubMed Google Scholar, 16Garnett M.J. Rana S. Paterson H. Barford D. Marais R. Mol.

Biol. 2006; 26: 2262-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), rendering the analysis of individual isoform behavior difficult; (iii) each RAF kinase is present predominantly as a cytoplasmic pool. To compare directly the membrane localization of each RAF isoform, we overexpressed them and applied conditions of serum starvation. Then, immediately before the coverslips were fixed and processed, we performed a mild permeabilization in order to eliminate the cytosolic pool of the kinases. Using this strategy in HeLa cells, we noticed that each RAF kinase exhibited distinct membrane targeting properties (Fig. 1). C-RAF almost completely colocalized with mitochondria (Fig. 1, A-C). Although we also detected a strong immunoreactivity for C-RAF in the nuclei of HeLa cells, this immunoreactivity was not attributable to the presence of the full length C-RAF but rather to a short form corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of this kinase (supplemental Fig. 1B). Only C-RAF was detected at the level of mitochondria; neither A-RAF (Fig. 1, D-F), B-RAF (Fig. 1, G-I), nor the kinase KSR (kinase suppressor of RAS, a kinase closely related to the RAFs) (data not shown) colocalized with this organelle. Although A-RAF fluorescence highlighted intracellular tubules and vesicles that we identified as endosomes, and KSR was present on the Golgi apparatus (data not shown), B-RAF did not associate with intracellular membranes of permeabilized cells. To obtain direct evidence that members of the RAF kinase family exhibit distinct subcellular localization, we coexpressed C-RAF and A-RAF and analyzed simultaneously the localization of both kinases using again our pre-permeabilization procedure (Fig. 1, J-L). We noticed a complete lack of overlap between A-RAF and C-RAF, thereby confirming at the single cell level that these kinases target different intracellular membranes. Immunoblots of purified mitochondria confirmed that, at endogenous expression levels, C-RAF is the only isoform present in significant amounts on the mitochondria of serum-starved cells (Fig. 2A). Collectively, these findings revealed the existence of distinct membrane localizations of the RAF kinases and the preferential localization of C-RAF to mitochondria. C-RAF Efficiently Binds to Purified Mitochondria in Vitro—To gain more insight into the interaction of RAF kinases with mitochondria, we decided to analyze this interaction in vitro. RAF kinases were produced and radiolabeled with [35S]Cys/Met by in vitro transcription/translation in reticulocyte lysates (as initially reported by Stancato et al. (18Stancato L.F. Chow Y.H. Hutchison K.A. Perdew G.H. Jove R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21711-21716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mixed with purified mitochondria obtained from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Autoradiographic analysis revealed that the RAF isoforms exhibit different abilities to associate with mitochondria (Fig. 2B). Although C-RAF associated with mitochondria in a fast and efficient fashion, the two other isoforms exhibited a significantly reduced binding (A-RAF) or behaved like the kinase MEK, which was included as a negative control in this assay (B-RAF) (Fig. 2B). The binding efficiency of C-RAF, measured as a percentage of the input bound at 15 min, was more than 2-fold higher than A-RAF and more than 5-fold higher than B-RAF (Fig. 2C). At this stage, a contamination of our mitochondrial preparations with endosomal membranes, detected with the markers Rab7 (supplemental Fig. 1A) and EEA1 (data not shown), constituted the most likely explanation for the residual binding observed with A-RAF using mitochondria from cultured cells. We extended our analysis to mitochondria obtained from a normal tissue, in this case from mouse liver (Fig. 2D). Again, we noticed a clear difference between C-RAF and the two other isoforms; C-RAF bound almost 5-fold more efficiently to mitochondria than B-RAF and A-RAF (Fig. 2D). We verified the specificity of our binding assay by replacing mitochondria with purified microsomal membranes (Fig. 2E) and detected no binding of C-RAF to microsomes, suggesting that the experiments presented indeed reflected C-RAF-specific interaction with mitochondria. Because the possibility that one of the RAF kinase isoforms (A-RAF) might be partially present inside mitochondria had been proposed by Yuryev et al. (19Yuryev A. Ono M. Goff S.A. Macaluso F. Wennogle L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4870-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we decided to test whether RAF kinases would be imported into this organelle. We tested this possibility by performing proteolytic treatments of mitochondria that had been incubated with RAF kinases (Fig. 2F). We had observed previously that RAF kinases produced in reticulocyte lysates are sensitive to proteinase K (data not shown). Although we observed that the iron-sulfur protein Rieske was processed and imported inside mitochondria in a membrane potential-dependent fashion (abrogated by valinomycin), none of the RAF kinases demonstrated resistance to externally added protease upon incubation with mitochondria (Fig. 2F). Therefore, RAF kinases were not imported inside mitochondria in vitro. At this point of the work, we concluded that C-RAF exhibits a specific capacity to bind to the surface of mitochondria. These results strongly confirmed our initial observation that RAF kinases have different tropisms for membrane organelles and encouraged us to use our acellular system further to learn more about C-RAF interaction with mitochondria. Mitochondrial Affinity Is an Intrinsic Property of C-RAF and the C-RAF Mitochondrial Binding Domain Localizes to Its Amino Terminus—Our observations that RAF kinases exhibit different affinities for mitochondria in acellular conditions suggested that the differences of subcellular distribution we had initially observed were intrinsic properties of the RAF kinases rather than the product of a cellular regulation that would have applied to one of the RAF isoforms. To examine the possibility that the activation of these kinases, for example obtained through the introduction of an oncogenic mutation, might interfere with their recruitment to mitochondria, we compared C-RAF and B-RAF wild type with their oncogenic versions, C-RAF DDED (mutated on residues 338, 341, 491, and 494) (20Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and B-RAF V600E. We found that these mutations did not alter the mitochondrial binding properties of either C-RAF or B-RAF (supplemental Fig. 2A). We also focused our attention on the role of Ser-338, a residue in which phosphorylation had previously been proposed to constitute a mitochondrial targeting signal (9Alavi A. Hood J.D. Frausto R. Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Science. 2003; 301: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 10Jin S. Zhuo Y. Guo W. Field J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24698-24705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A non-phosphorylatable mutant in which this residue was replaced with Ala was compared with C-RAF WT; we found that C-RAF S338A exhibits an affinity for mitochondria that is comparable to C-RAF WT (supplemental Fig. 2B). Reciprocally, phosphomimetic mutants with an Asp residue introduced on Ser at positions 338 and 339 did not increase the recruitment of C-RAF to mitochondria (data not shown). These findings indicated that the phosphorylation of Ser-338 is neither necessary nor sufficient for the mitochondrial targeting of C-RAF. We concluded that the conformational changes that accompany the activation of RAF kinases do not change their affinity for mitochondria. To address directly the possibility that C-RAF affinity for mitochondria might be an intrinsic property of this isoform, we decided to identify the sequence determinants that account for it. We constructed a set of vectors allowing the expression of different parts of C-RAF, as well as some chimeras between C-RAF and B-RAF (Fig. 3). Each protein was synthesized and radiolabeled in vitro in reticulocyte lysates and incubated with purified mitochondria as described above (Fig. 3). Interestingly, all chimeras in which the first 100 amino-terminal residues of B-RAF were substituted with corresponding residues from C-RAF showed an increased recruitment to mitochondria (Fig. 3). These results indicated that the amino-terminal regulatory region of RAF kinases determines their mitochondrial affinity, an interesting point considering that this region concentrates almost all sequence divergences between the isoforms of RAF. To determine directly which part of the C-RAF kinase binds mitochondria, two constructs covering the carboxyl terminus of C-RAF (residues 324-648) or its amino terminus (residues 1-323) were compared in this assay. This analysis revealed that the amino-terminal domain of C-RAF binds efficiently to mitochondria, in contrast to its carboxyl terminus (Fig. 3). We concluded that C-RAF amino terminus confers its mitochondrial interaction properties on the entire C-RAF kinase. Protein Binding Partner(s) Other Than RAS GTPases Support C-RAF Recruitment on Mitochondria—RAF kinases, and in particular C-RAF, can interact in vitro both with proteins and also with lipid mixtures (21Hekman M. Hamm H. Villar A.V. Bader B. Kuhlmann J. Nickel J. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24090-24102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To determine which of these molecules C-RAF would recognize, we treated purified mitochondria with trypsin (Fig. 4A). This procedure, which removed the proteins of the mitochondrial outer membrane (Bcl-XL) but left intact intrinsic mitochondrial proteins (the matrix protein Mn-SOD), almost completely abolished the recruitment of C-RAF (Fig. 4A). Therefore, we concluded that C-RAF interacts with proteins of the mitochondrial surface. Small GTPases of the RAS family constitute a prime candidate as binding partners for RAF kinases on the surface of mitochondria. To test their contribution to the recruitment of C-RAF, we used the following approaches: (i) we tested the effect of Mg2+ chelation by EDTA, a procedure that triggers the transition of small GTPases to an inactive, nucleotide-free form (Fig. 4B); and (ii) we compared the binding of C-RAF WT with the mutant R89L, a mutation that abrogates the binding of C-RAF to activated RAS (22Bondeva T. Balla A. Varnai P. Balla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2323-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C). Clearly, neither of these two procedures abrogated the binding of C-RAF to mitochondria (Fig. 4, B and C). We concluded that, under the conditions of our assay, protein binding partners other than RAS GTPases account for most of the binding of C-RAF to mitochondria. To confirm this observation in intact cells, we tested the intracellular distribution of the mutant R89L of C-RAF with the protocol that we had used for the experiments presented in Fig. 1. We found that C-RAF R89L exhibited the same mitochondrial localization as C-RAF WT (supplemental Fig. 3). We concluded that the mitochondrial recruitment of C-RAF is, at least in this cell system, independent of RAS GTPases. Active C-RAF Specifically Changes Mitochondrial Subcellular Distribution in a MEK-dependent Fashion—To analyze the consequences of C-RAF activation on mitochondria, we decided to use an inducible system, allowing a kinetic analysis of the consequences of C-RAF activation. We used a cell line stably expressing low levels of a fusion protein between an activated form of C-RAF (C-RAF-BXB) and the hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (23Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2576-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This oncogenic version of C-RAF, which consists of an internal deletion of its Ras-binding domain (between residues 65 and 304) still bound mitochondria with high affinity in vitro and in intact cells (data not shown). In this system, C-RAF activation was achieved through the application of the estrogen receptor agonist 4-hydroxytamoxifene (4-OHT, 1 μm). Using this system, we observed that C-RAF activation causes an intense remodeling of this organelle, characterized by a change from long, filamentous to short, spherical mitochondria clustered around the nucleus. The activation of C-RAF was sufficient to produce this mitochondrial remodeling, because it could be observed in serum-free conditions (Fig. 5, A-D). Transmission electron microscopy confirmed these observations (Fig. 5, E and F); although mitochondria from control cells were visible as longitudinal as well as cross-sections, we observed spherical elements only in cells in which C-RAF had been activated for 12 h. Despite this intense change in shape and distribution, the inner architecture of mitochondria remained normal (Fig. 5, E and F). Mitochondrial remodeling occurred progressively upon 4-OHT addition and was systematically noticed after 12 h of treatment"

Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5323-5329Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although mazG is highly conserved among bacteria, it appears not to be essential to the bacterial viability, because an Escherichia coli strain lacking mazG still survived under laboratory conditions (1Zhang J. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5323-5329Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It was proposed that MazG might have a “housecleaning” function by hydrolyzing noncanonical NTPs, such as 8-oxo-dGTP, dUTP, dITP, and 2-oxo-dATP, whose incorporation into the nascent DNA leads to the increased mutagenesis and DNA damage (2Moroz O.V.

Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 590-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Addiction systems are specified by the labile antitoxin (MazE in this case), which is rapidly degraded by a specific protease, and its cognate stable toxin (MazF) that, in the absence of antitoxin, acts on its target, causing immediate cell growth inhibition and, after a prolonged period, death (5Engelberg-Kulka H.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1084-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Comparison of the survival ability of wild-type E. coli and its ΔmazG mutant under amino acid starvation allows us to suggest that MazG has a function of delaying the “point of no return” (4Gross M. Marianovsky I. Glaser G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 590-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Amitai S. Yassin Y. Engelberg-Kulka H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8295-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (i.e. under nutritional stress, MazG can extend the period of cell survival until final switching on the mechanism of programmed cell death). Despite the substantial involvement of MazG in the stringent response, molecular background of MazG activity is still obscure. Nevertheless, the crystal structures of five its single-domain analogs were solved: Vibrio sp. iMazG (12Robinson A. Guilfoyle A.P. Harrop S.J. Boucher Y. Stokes H.W. Curmi P.N. Mabbutt B.C. Mol.

Studies on phylogenetic distribution of MazG domains suggest that the most abundant form of MazG, to which MazG of E. coli belongs, occurs as a protein with two sequence-related domains in tandem (12Robinson A.

Sequence homology searches showed that in all bacterial genomes currently defined, the gene encoding the subfamily of tandem domain MazG occurs in conjunction with the relA gene (e.g. in all five Vibrio genomes available, in Deinococcus radiodurans, and, of course, in E. coli (12Robinson A.

The biological role of such tandem domain MazG proteins appears to be to regulate cellular levels of ppGpp (4Gross M. Marianovsky I. Glaser G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 590-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Braeken K. Moris M. Daniels R. Vanderleyden J. Michiels J.

Here, we report the first crystal structure of tandem domain MazG from E. coli (EcMazG) at 2.0 Å resolution, which forms a dimer through the interaction of two repeated MazG-like domains. Two domains have similarly folded globular structures; however, NTPase activity was observed only at the C-terminal domain. Crystal structure of an ATP-bound form and its subsequent site-directed mutagenesis study revealed the key residues for the magnesium coordination, substrate stability, and enzyme catalysis. Starvation experiments suggest that MazG prevents cell death under conditions of nutrient starvation using the C-terminal NTPase activity. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of MazG from E. coli—The gene coding for full-length EcMazG (residues 1–263) was amplified from the chromosomal DNA of E. coli strain by PCR with the primers as shown in supplemental Table 1. The PCR product was then subcloned into pPROEX HTa (Invitrogen) with His6 at the N terminus and a recombinant TEV protease cleavage site. The resulting expression vector, pPROEX HTa: EcmazG, was transformed into E. coli B834 strain and was grown in an LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to A600 of 0.6. After induction with 1.0 mm IPTG 2The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; SeMet, selenomethionine; DTT, dithiothreitol; SH, serine hydroxamate; ND, N-terminal domain; CT, C-terminal domain. for a further 20 h at 22 °C, the culture was harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and disrupted by ultrasonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 1 h, and lysate was bound to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). After washing with buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole, the bound proteins were eluted with 300 mm imidazole in buffer A. The His6 tag was released from the EcMazG by incubating with recombinant TEV protease (Invitrogen). Further purification was done by applying the sequential chromatographic steps of HiTrap Q ion exchange and Superdex 200 size exclusion. The purified protein with three-residue cloning artifact (Gly-His-Met) at the N terminus was concentrated to 20 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and stored at -80 °C for crystallization trials. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified protein showed a single band of ∼30.0 kDa that corresponds to the calculated molecular weight of an EcMazG monomer. The SeMet-substituted protein was expressed in a minimal medium supplemented with SeMet and purified under the same conditions as the wild-type protein. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—The initial crystallizing conditions were obtained from Sparse Matrix Screening (15Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). Suitable crystals for diffraction appeared around 0.1 m trisodium citrate (pH 5.5), 0.2 m ammonium acetate, and 20% polyethylene glycol 4000 at 22 °C within 2 days and reached up to their maximal sizes in about 7 days with dimensions of ∼0.4 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm. For data collection, 30% (w/v) glycerol was added to the crystallizing precipitant as a cryoprotectant, and the crystals were immediately placed in a -173 °C nitrogen gas stream. X-ray diffraction data of native crystals were collected at a resolution of 2.0 Å at the 6C1 beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory using a QUANTUM 210 CCD detector (ADSC, San Diego, CA). For the ATP-bound EcMazG structure, crystals of EcMazG K257A mutant were obtained from the same crystallization conditions as for wild-type EcMazG, supplemented with 25 mm MgCl2, and soaked with ATP to a final concentration of 2.5 mm for 1 h. The data were then indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 suite (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The crystals belonged to the space group P212121, with the unit cell parameters a = 62.78, b = 67.42, c = 140.075 Å. With two EcMazG molecules in the asymmetric unit, the crystal volume per unit of protein mass was 2.53 Å3 Da-1, corresponding to a solvent content of 51% (17Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7917) Google Scholar). The SeMet-substituted protein crystals were obtained from the same crystallizing conditions as for the native protein crystal. The single wave-length anomalous dispersion data with the SeMet crystal were collected at the 6C1 beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory at a wavelength of 0.97953 Å. Fourteen selenium atoms of the expected 16 in the asymmetric unit were identified at 2.9 Å resolution using the program SOLVE (18Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). The electron density was improved by density modification using the program RESOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar), resulting in 52% of the cloned residues being automatically built. Further model building was performed manually using the program WinCoot (20Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

For the preparation of EcMazG deletion mutants, genes coding for N-terminal (residues from Met1 to Ala127) and C-terminal domains (residues from Ser138 to Leu263) of EcMazG were amplified from the pPROEX HTa: EcmazG by PCR. The PCR product was then subcloned into pPROEX HTa (Invitrogen) with His6 at the N terminus and a recombinant TEV protease cleavage site. Expression and purification of point and deletion mutants of EcMazG were performed with the same protocol as described above. NTPase Activity Assay—ATP and dTTP were used for representing substrates of purine-based ribonucleoside triphosphate and pyrimidine-based deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, respectively. The NTPase activity of wild-type and mutant EcMazG was assayed by detecting hydrolyzed nucleoside monophosphate by TLC. The assay was carried out in 20 μl of reaction buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT) containing ATP or dTTP to a final concentration of 1 mm. An appropriate protein to the final concentration of 20 μm was added in order to initiate the reaction and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of equal volume of stop buffer (2% SDS and 20 mm EDTA), and 2 μl of terminated reaction mixture was spotted on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate, which was then developed in 0.75 m KH2PO4, pH 3.3. For detection of hydrolyzed products, spots were visualized by UV shadowing. Cell Growth Rate Measurement and Nutrient Starvation Experiment—E. coli strain BL21 ΔmazG was obtained by insertion of the kan+ coding gene into the mazG using a suicide vector, pCVD422 (23Philippe N. Alcaraz J.P. Coursange E. Geiselmann J. Schneider D. Plasmid. 2004; 51: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and the strain was used for cell growth rate measurement. The strain was transformed with expression plasmids producing wild-type EcMazG and its mutants. Transformants were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB-Amp/Kan medium. Overnight culture was inoculated onto fresh medium, and 1 mm IPTG was added to induce protein expression at A600 = 0.2. Samples were collected at the appropriate time, and cell growth was monitored by measuring the A600. For viable cell counts, samples were collected at the appropriate time and washed with M9 medium. After serial dilutions, 100 μl of cultures was spotted on LB-Amp/Kan plates. Viable cell growth was then monitored by measuring colony-forming units. In order to test the effect of nutrient starvation on cell growth, E. coli strain BL21 ΔmazG transformed with an appropriate expression plasmid was grown on M9 minimal medium with supplements (0.2% glucose, all amino acids (20 μg/ml each), 0.05 mm thiamine, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2) to A600 = 0.2, and 1 mm IPTG was added. Thirty min after induction, serine hydroxamate (SH) was added to the final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and cells were grown for 5 h in nutrient starvation conditions. Optical density and viable cell count measurement was performed as described above. Primer Extension Experiments—E. coli MC4100 ΔmazEFG relA+ strain was transformed with pSK10Δ6-pef plasmid carrying lacZ gene under mazEFG promoter (24Marianovsky I. Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5975-5984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The transformants were grown in M9 minimal medium, supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 0.2% glucose, and a mixture of all amino acids at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.2. At this point, cell culture was divided into two flasks, and one of them was treated with 1 mg/ml SH. Samples for primer extension analysis were taken just prior to the division and 5, 10, and 20 min after it. RNA extraction was carried out using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Primer extension experiments were carried out with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) according to Gafny et al. (25Gafny R. Hyman H.C. Razin S. Glaser G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primer used for the pSK10Δ6-pef construct was “-40 M13 forward” (Amersham Biosciences) from the lacZ gene to the transcription start sites of the mazEFG promoter. The primer was end-labeled by polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc.) with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and purified on the Sephadex G-50 columns (Roche Applied Science). Reaction products were resolved on a 6% sequencing gel. A DNA sequencing reaction was performed with the same plasmid and primer and run on the gel parallel to the primer extension reaction. To quantify the RNA levels, the gels were analyzed, and the bands were quantified using the Fujix BAS100 PhosphorImager. Overall Fold of E. coli MazG—EcMazG is mostly composed of α-helices. A monomer contains 10 α-helices and can be subdivided into two domains, the N- and C-terminal domains. Each domain consists of five α-helices (α1–α5 for the N-terminal and α6–α10 for the C-terminal domain) with a linker (Ala124–Pro140) between them (Fig. 1A). Intertwining of two respective domains generates two new globular structures in the dimeric EcMazG structure, which will be referred to hereafter as ND and CD for the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively (Fig. 1B). Hydrophobic interactions between α2 and α3 helices or α7 and α8 helices mediate protein dimerization (supplemental Fig. 1). Two sets of two α-helices (α2 and α3 of the ND and α7 and α8 of the CD) form a four-helical bundle in both ND and CD. Both domains have heart-shaped “rigid core” regions, which are formed by four α-helices (α1–α4 and α6–α9 for the ND and CD, respectively). In ND, two α-helices of α1 and α4 are located perpendicular to the four-helical bundle and stabilized mostly by hydrophobic interactions through a series of nonpolar residues from α1, α3, and α4. The CD is similarly folded as that of the ND using its corresponding α-helices (Fig. 1B). The last helix α5 or α10 of the respective ND or CD is located in parallel with the four-helical bundle of each domain. Although the flexible α5 in the ND is traced only in one molecule, the α10 in the CD is tightly bound to the extended region of α9, which forms an “additional region” (Fig. 1B). CD of EcMazG Has an NTPase Activity—The crystal structure of EcMazG shows four potential active sites at an EcMazG dimer, two each from the ND and the CD, all of which contain the EEXX(E/D) motif: Glu38, Glu39, Glu42, Glu58, and Asp61 from the α2 and α3 in the ND domain, Glu171, Glu172, Glu175, Glu192, Glu193, and Asp196 from α7 and α8 in the CD domain (Fig. 1, B and C). In both domains, several conserved positively charged residues (Lys91, Arg95, and Lys119 in the ND and Lys222, Arg226, and Lys257 in the CD) are located close to the EEXX(E/D) motif. To find out the domain(s) that has an NTPase activity, we performed NTPase assays using the wild-type EcMazG and several point and deletion mutants. Among all eight canonical nucleotides (ATP, TTP, GTP, CTP, dTTP, dGTP, dCTP, and UTP), ATP and dTTP were used as representatives of purine-based ribonucleoside triphosphate and pyrimidine-based deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, respectively. Wild-type EcMazG showed a strong nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolysis activity against ATP and dTTP. Although the mutations on the ND (R95A/K118A) do not affect the nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolysis activity, those on the CD (R226A/K257A) caused loss of the activity against both ATP and dTTP (Fig. 2). The structure-based deletion mutants further confirmed these data; contrary to a C-terminal deletion mutant (Met1–Ala127) with no nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolysis activity, the N-terminal deletion mutant (Ser138–Leu263) showed the same amount of enzymatic activity as that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2). The Active Site of CD—The active site of the CD domain was revealed by the EcMazG-ATP complex structure and the subsequent mutation studies. To prevent the hydrolysis of the ATP molecule during crystallization, the K118A/K257A mutant of EcMazG was used for the complex structure with ATP. There was no structural difference between the apo- and the ATP-bound form of the enzyme. Only one ATP molecule was bound at one of the two C-terminal active sites with no ATP molecule at the other active site, in which the side chain of Met241 from the symmetry-related molecule occupies, and as expected, no ATP molecule was found at the N-terminal active sites. At the active site of the CD, one magnesium ion was coordinated by three acidic residues of Glu172, Glu193, and Asp196 from the two EEXX(E/D) motifs with two hydroxyl groups of α- and γ-phosphates as the remnant ligands. β-Phosphate interacts with the side chains of Lys222 and Arg226 and with two water molecules. The ribose ring is stabilized by forming a hydrogen bond between the 3′-hydroxyl group of the ring and the side chain of Arg226. The adenine base was located in a hydrophobic pocket constituted by a series of conserved aromatic residues, Phe157, Trp159, Phe199, Phe223, and Trp253 (Fig. 3, A–C). Based on the structural features of the active site and amino acid sequence conservation analysis (Figs. 1C and 3B), 14 point mutants were constructed, including R95A, K118A, K168A, E171A, E172A, E175A, K189A, E192A, E193A, D196A, K222A, R226A, W253A, and K257A, and their NTPase activity was checked. The ATP pyrophosphohydrolysis activity was detected for the mutants of R95A, K118A, K168A, E171A, E175A, K189A, and E192A but not for those of E172A, E193A, D196A, K222A, R226A, W253A, and K257A (Fig. 3D). In order to test the inhibitory effect of MazG overexpression on cell growth rate in E. coli, the activities of the mutants were further tested in vivo. Like wild-type EcMazG, the overexpression of the mutants of R95A, K118A, K168A, E171A, E175A, K189A, or E192A significantly retarded the E. coli growth. However, the strain transformed with the mutants of E172A, E193A, D196A, K222A, R226A, W253A, or K257A has grown normally (Fig. 3, E and F). The Physiological Effect of EcMazG Mutants at Nutritional Stress—In order to identify the domain that is responsible for MazG-dependent cellular response to nutrition starvation and to test how the abolishment of NTPase activity of the CD domain influences the function, amino acid starvation experiments were performed using various constructs of EcMazG. mazG-deleted E. coli strain BL21 was transformed with four expression plasmids: the wild-type EcMazG and three of its mutants: R95A/K118A (MazG-ND), R226A/K257A (MazG-CD), and R95A/K118A/R226A/K257A (MazG-ND/-CD), which represent EcMazG proteins lacking activity in the ND, the CD, and both the ND and CD, respectively. Serine hydroxamate (SH), a serine analog, at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was used for the induction of the stringent response (4Gross M. Marianovsky I. Glaser G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 590-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In accordance with the data described above (Fig. 3, E and F), whereas the growth of cells expressing the wild-type or MazG-ND mutant was arrested under normal conditions, cells expressing MazG-CD or MazG-ND/-CD mutants grow without growth arrest. However, the induction of amino acid starvation by SH addition reverses the patterns of cell growth; cells expressing wild-type or MazG-ND mutant revert to their normal growth, whereas cells expressing MazG-CD or MazG-ND/-CD mutants show growth arrest (Fig. 4A). The effect of SH induction on the cell growth was also measured by monitoring colony-forming units of the same set of constructs used above, which also showed the same tendency as the optical density cell measurements (Fig. 4, B and C). Unique Structural Features of the CD—The crystal structure of EcMazG reveals that the protein is composed of two similarly folded MazG-like domains in tandem. Point and deletion mutagenesis studies showed that only the CD domain exhibited an NTPase activity, which might be explained by the structural differences between the potential active sites in two domains. The well organized active sites of the CD are derived from the tightly formed “additional region,” in which α10 helix is stabilized on the extended region of the α9 through hydrophobic interactions among Val230, Ile233, Val234, Val252, and Val256 (Fig. 5, A and B). On the other hand, the lack of the corresponding region at the short α4 induces the last helix α5 flexible in ND (Fig. 5A). The extended region, seven amino acids, of the α9 helix serves as a rigid supporter for the α10 helix, and they together form an additional region, where the α10 helix provides key residues for substrate binding and enzyme catalysis, such as Trp263 and Lys257 (Figs. 3B and 5A). Moreover, among five conserved aromatic residues (Phe157, Trp159, Phe199, Phe223, and Trp253) involved in the formation of the nucleotide base binding pocket at the C-terminal active site, only two residues (Trp23 and Trp115) are conserved in the N-terminal active site, implying different nucleotide base binding pocket environments between the active sites of these two domains (Fig. 1C). The S. solfataricus MazG (Protein Data Bank code 1vmg) and C. violaceum MazG (Protein Data Bank code 2a7w) are short versions of the MazG-like proteins, which are composed of one MazG-like domain with 83 and 108 amino acid residues, respectively. They are composed of only four α-helices and well superimposed with the rigid core region of both ND and CD of EcMazG, resulting in no additional region (Fig. 5, A and C). It was suggested that this type of one-domain MazG proteins has a “housecleaning”"

Here we show that p75-Cux1, the shortest isoform of Cux1, transcribed from an alternative promoter within intron 20, is also deregulated in polycystic kidneys derived from Pkd1 mutant embryos. To determine the role of the p75-Cux1 isoform in cystogenesis, we generated transgenic mice expressing p75-CUX1 in the kidneys and other tissues. Strikingly, these animals developed polycystic kidneys at variable penetrance and severity, correlating with transgene expression levels. Histological and marker analysis of p75-CUX1-derived polycystic kidneys revealed renal cysts derived from the tubular nephron, supporting a model of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Transgenic p75-CUX1 kidneys additionally showed an up-regulation of the protooncogene c-myc and a down-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. Chromatin affinity purification experiments confirmed the direct interaction of Cux1 with the c-myc and p27 promoters. These molecular alterations were accompanied by an increase in cilia length and in the proliferative index of epithelial cells lining the cysts.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) 3The abbreviations used are: ADPKD, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; ChAP, chromatin affinity purification; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HA, hemagglutinin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. is characterized by the development of renal cysts progressively leading to renal failure.

Interestingly, the inhibition, reduction, or overexpression of Polycystin-1 all result in polycystic kidney formation in mice, underlying the need for a tight regulation of Pkd1 expression during normal kidney development (9Lu W.

There is high variability in the phenotypic outcome of polycystic kidney diseases, suggesting that other genes contribute to disease development. Some players involved in polycystic kidney disease have been discovered through the study of genetically modified animals. Renal cystic phenotypes were indeed observed in mice carrying gene mutations in APC (14Qian C.N. Knol J. Igarashi P. Lin F. Zylstra U. Teh B.T. Williams B.O. J. Biol.

CUX1 (cut homeobox, also referred to as CDP or Cutl1) belongs to a family of transcription factors involved in the cellular control of proliferation and differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 21Nepveu A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in Drosophila suggest that cut plays a role in determining cell-type specificity in several tissues, notably the Malpighian tubules (22Jack J. Dorsett D. Delotto Y. Liu S.

In the mouse, the majority of Cux1 mutant animals die during the perinatal period, whereas about 20% survive to adulthood. These surviving mice display a complex phenotype including growth retardation, delayed differentiation of lung epithelia, altered hair follicle morphogenesis, male infertility, and a deficit in B and T cells (32Ellis T.

The full-length protein, p200, binds rapidly but transiently to DNA and carries the CCAAT displacement activity (36Moon N.S. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31325-31334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 37Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, the p110 and p75 isoforms behave like classical transcription factors engaging in slow and stable interactions with DNA (37Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 38Goulet B. Watson P. Poirier M. Leduy L. Berube G. Meterissian S. Jolicoeur P. Nepveu A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6625-6633PubMed Google Scholar). The p110 isoform contains three DNA binding domains and results from the proteolytic cleavage of the full-length protein by cathepsin L (39Goulet B. Baruch A. Moon N.S. Poirier M. Sansregret L.L. Erickson A. Bogyo M. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), whereas the p75 isoform contains two DNA binding domains and is encoded by an mRNA that is initiated within intron 20 (38Goulet B. Watson P. Poirier M. Leduy L. Berube G. Meterissian S. Jolicoeur P. Nepveu A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6625-6633PubMed Google Scholar). The p75 and p110 isoforms have similar transcriptional properties (38Goulet B. Watson P. Poirier M. Leduy L. Berube G. Meterissian S. Jolicoeur P. Nepveu A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6625-6633PubMed Google Scholar). Cux1 overexpression is detected in polycystic kidneys of the congenital polycystic (cpk) (40Vanden Heuvel G.B. Bodmer R. McConnell K.R. Nagami G.T. Igarashi P. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and Pkd1 null mouse models (41Sharma M. Brantley J.G. Alcalay N.I. Zhou J. Heystek E. Maser R.L. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Kidney Int. 2005; 67: 432-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The precise activity of Cux1 in these models remains unclear as Cux1 overexpression is associated with increased proliferation in the Pkd1 model and increased apoptosis in the cpk model (41Sharma M. Brantley J.G. Alcalay N.I. Zhou J. Heystek E. Maser R.L. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Kidney Int. 2005; 67: 432-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, transgenic mice expressing the CUX1 p200 isoform under the control of the CMV enhancer/promoter displayed multiorgan (including renal) hyperplasia associated with glomerular abnormalities, interstitial fibrosis, and proteinuria (42Ledford A.W. Brantley J.G. Kemeny G. Foreman T.L. Quaggin S.E. Igarashi P. Oberhaus S.M. Rodova M. Calvet J.P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Dev.

A role for CUX1 in cell proliferation, specifically in the S phase of the cell cycle, has been inferred from a number of reports. The histone nuclear factor D (HiNF-D), which was later found to include CUX1 as its DNA binding partner, was shown to be up-regulated in S phase in normal cells (44van Wijnen A.J. Wright K.L.

Up-regulation of CUX1 DNA binding at the end of the G1 phase was found to result from at least two post-translational modifications: dephosphorylation of the Cut homeodomain by the Cdc25A phosphatase (49Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4680-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and proteolytic cleavage of p200-CUX1 (37Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 39Goulet B. Baruch A. Moon N.S. Poirier M. Sansregret L.L. Erickson A. Bogyo M. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence now points to a crucial role of the shorter CUX1 isoforms in hyperproliferation and tumorigenesis. Proteolytic processing of CUX1 was found to be enhanced in many cancer cell lines (50Goulet B. Sansregret L. Leduy L. Bogyo M. Weber E. Chauhan S.S. Nepveu A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2007; 5: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and constitutive expression of p110-CUX1 was shown to stimulate cell proliferation by accelerating S phase entry (51Sansregret L. Goulet B. Harada R. Wilson B. Leduy L. Bertoglio J. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2441-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Aberrant expression of p75-CUX1 mRNA or protein was observed in several breast cancer cell lines (38Goulet B. Watson P. Poirier M. Leduy L. Berube G. Meterissian S. Jolicoeur P. Nepveu A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6625-6633PubMed Google Scholar) and a significant association was established between higher p75-CUX1 expression and a diffuse infiltrative growth pattern in invasive tumors (38Goulet B. Watson P. Poirier M. Leduy L. Berube G. Meterissian S. Jolicoeur P. Nepveu A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6625-6633PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, MMTV::p75-CUX1 transgenic mice displayed increased susceptibility to a form of myeloproliferative leukemia (52Cadieux C. Fournier S. Peterson A.C. Bedard C. Bedell B.J. Nepveu A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9492-9501Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The close association of the p75-CUX1 isoform with hyperproliferation led us to hypothesize that it could also contribute to the development of polycystic kidneys. In support of this, we find the p75-Cux1 isoform overexpressed in Pkd1-/- polycystic kidneys. To directly assess the role of this isoform in kidney cyst formation, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing p75-CUX1 in the kidneys. We show that p75-CUX1 transgenic mice develop polycystic kidneys in a dose-dependent manner. This phenotype is associated with increased cell proliferation and correlates with up-regulation of c-myc and down-regulation of p27 expression. Transgenic and Knock-out Mice—The p75-CUX1 transgenic construct included the cmv immediate early enhancer and the chicken β-actin promoter, as present in the pTriEx 2.1 vector (Novagen), the coding sequences for amino acids 1062–1505 of the human CUX1 protein (GenBank accession number M74099) in-frame with an HA tag and followed by a rabbit β-globin polyadenylation signal. The final construct was excised from the vector and injected into FVB/N pronuclei. Two lines of p75-CUX1 transgenic mice were obtained: Tg157 and Tg166. Mouse colonies were maintained by breeding transgenic mice with wild-type FVB mice or as homozygous transgenics. Genotyping was performed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA prepared from mouse-tail biopsy using primers in the cmv promoter 5′-CGTGCTGGTTATTGTGCTGTCTCAT-3′, and CUX1 cDNA sequence 5′-TCCACATTGTTGGGGTCGTTC-3′. Pkd1-/- mice (53Wu G. Tian X. Nishimura S. Markowitz G.S. D'Agati V. Park J.H. Yao L. Li L. Geng L. Zhao H. Edelmann W. Somlo S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1845-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were genotyped using the following primers: 5′-CTAGCGTCTGGATCCAGCGGC-3′, 5′-GATCTCCTGTCATCTCACCTTGCT-3′ and 5′-GGGAGGAGGAGGAGCTGG-3′. All experiments involving animals were conducted in accordance with McGill University animal care guidelines. In Situ Hybridization—Kidneys were dissected and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, then immersed in 30% sucrose prior to embedding in tissue freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences). The intron 20-specific probe was prepared with the following primers: 5′-GCAAGAATGGCTGCTCAAACTATC-3′ and 5′-AACACAGTCCCAAGGTCTACGACG-3′, and the full-length CUX1-specific probe was prepared with the following primers: 5′-CAGCGCTTATTTGGGGAGACC-3′ and 5′-TGGAACCAGTTGATGACGGTG-3′. In situ was performed as previously described (54Henrique D. Adam J. Myat A. Chitnis A. Lewis J. Ish-Horowicz D. Nature. 1995; 375: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar) using digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis— RNA was extracted by homogenizing tissues in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA extracts were digested with DNase I (1 unit per reaction for 45 min), purified and reverse-transcribed with the Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The following primer pairs were used to perform Real-Time PCR using the Qiagen SYBR Green PCR kit: c-myc, 5′-CGGACACACAACGTCTTGGA-3′, 5′-CAACTGTTCTCGTCGTTTCC-3′, p27 5′-GACTCGCTTCTTCCATATCCCGGCAGT-3′, 5′-CCGCCCGAGGAGGAAGATGTCAAACGTG-3′, Pkd1 (5′-AGACACCGCTCAACTTCCATTG-3′, 5′-TTCTTCCTTCCGACCTGCTTTC-3′. Immunoblotting—Total protein extracts were prepared by homogenizing 100 mg of tissue in 200 μl of lysis buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, Protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche), sodium fluoride (10 mm), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), sodium vanadate (1 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), iodoacetamide (1 mm)) and mixing for 30 min at 4 °C. The extracts were centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatants collected. Protein concentration was calculated using the BCA protocol (Pierce). Western blot analyses with anti-HA (Covance; 1:4000), anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:4000), and anti-CUX1 1300 (1:1000) were done as previously described (37Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Histology, Immunohistochemistry, and TUNEL Stainings— Formalin-fixed organs were embedded in paraffin and cut in sections of 5 μm. Sections were rehydrated and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) according to standard procedures for histology analysis. Alternatively, sections were prepared for immunohistochemistry by antigen retrieval with 10 mm sodium citrate solution (pH 6) at 95 °C for 10 min. After blocking for 1 h in normal goat serum, slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: anti-HA (1:500; Covance), anti-CUX1 1300 (1:500), anti-calbindin (1:300; Chemicon), anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (1:500; Dako), and anti-acetylated α-tubulin (1:1000; Sigma) or with biotinylated lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin (1:500; Vector). Sections were then incubated either directly with a fluorescence-coupled secondary antibody, or with a biotin-linked secondary antibody followed by the ABC elite reagent (Vector). For immunohistochemistry, the DAB reagent (Vector) was used prior to counterstaining with hematoxylin and mounting. For immunofluorescence, staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (200 ng/ml) was performed prior to mounting. Acetylated α-tubulin staining was visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. TUNEL assay was performed using the ApopTag Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Chemicon), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Classification of Polycystic Kidneys—Polycystic kidneys were classified as mild or moderate to severe. H&E stainings of adult kidney sections were scored using the following system: a mild phenotype represents kidneys with 1 to 5 cysts per section typically covering less than 5% of the kidney surface, moderate cystic kidneys contain more than 5 cysts per section which typically cover up to 50% of the kidney surface, and severe cystic kidneys contain cysts covering more than 50% of the kidney surface. p75-CUX1 Expression in MDCK Cells—MDCK cells were maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% serum. Cells were infected with pRev empty vector or p75-CUX1HA-containing vector and selected with hygromycin (350 μg/ml) to generate stable cell lines. Retrovirus production was performed as described (51Sansregret L. Goulet B. Harada R. Wilson B. Leduy L. Bertoglio J. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2441-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Chromatin Affinity Purification (ChAP)—CUX1 amino acids 1062–1505 (corresponding to p75-CUX1) was fused to protein A and CBP tags (pREV/TRE, Clontech) and stably expressed in Hs578T breast cancer cells. The cells were synchronized by a single thymidine block for 18 h, cross-linked and lysed. Fifty percent of the cell extract was used to purify p75-CUX1-bound DNA by ChAP as described (55Harada R. Vadnais C. Sansregret L. Leduy L. Berube G. Robert F. Nepveu A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The remaining 50% was used to measure nonspecific binding by performing ChAP with Sepharose beads instead of IgG Sepharose at the first purification step. The following primers were used to amplify promoter regions: c-myc 5′-ATCCTCTCTCGCTAATCTCCGC-3′, 5′-TCCCTCCCTCCGTTCTTTTTC-3′, p27 5′-AATGTCCATGGCCTTAACTGT-3′, 5′-GAAGCCAAAGCGAACGTCTT-3′, Pkd1 5′-TCTCACCATCAACCTCCCATTG-3′, 5′-TATTTTTCACGCTCCGCCCC-3′, and G6PDH 5′-GGATGATCCCAAATTCATCG-3′, 5′-AGGTCAGTTCCTCCACCTTG-3′. Expression of Cux1 Isoform p75 Is Increased in the Kidneys of Pkd1 Null Mice—Overexpression of the full-length Cux1 in Pkd1-/- polycystic kidneys was reported previously (41Sharma M. Brantley J.G. Alcalay N.I. Zhou J. Heystek E. Maser R.L. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Kidney Int. 2005; 67: 432-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To determine whether p75, a more transcriptionally active isoform of Cux1 was also expressed in Pkd1-/- kidneys, a cRNA probe was designed to recognize the p75-Cux1-specific region within intron 20 (38Goulet B. Watson P. Poirier M. Leduy L. Berube G. Meterissian S. Jolicoeur P. Nepveu A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6625-6633PubMed Google Scholar). In situ hybridization stainings in Pkd1-/- and control kidneys revealed a significant up-regulation of p75-Cux1 mRNA expression in these polycystic kidneys (Fig. 1, A–C). This increase in p75 expression paralleled the transcriptional up-regulation of the full-length Cux1 (Fig. 1, D–F). It is thus plausible that the p75-Cux1 isoform plays a role in kidney cyst formation. Generation of p75-CUX1 Transgenic Mice—To directly address the role of p75-CUX1 in cystogenesis, transgenic mice specifically expressing this shorter isoform were generated. For this, the sequence coding for amino acids 1062–1505 of the human CUX1 protein (precisely corresponding to the p75 isoform) was fused to a HA tag and expressed under the cytomegalovirus promoter (Fig. 2A). Two transgenic lines were obtained that expressed the transgene. Western blot analysis against the p75-specific HA tag on whole kidney extracts revealed strong expression of p75-CUX1 in heterozygous transgenic line 166 (Tg166) (Fig. 2B, mice numbers 2, 6, 12, and 13), and a weaker expression in transgenic line 157 (Tg157) (Fig. 2B, mice numbers 3, 5, 10, and 11). The highest p75-CUX1 expression levels were obtained by breeding Tg166 to homozygosity (Fig. 2B, mice numbers 7, 14, and 15). An antibody detecting both the endogenous and transgenic Cux1 (anti-1300, identified in Fig. 2A) revealed a marked overexpression of p75-CUX1 in Tg166 in comparison to endogenous protein expression levels (Fig. 2B). In contrast, Tg157 expression showed a more modest overexpression (Fig. 2B). In addition to their expression in the kidney, analysis of protein expression in other organs showed high activity of Tg166 in the spleen, mammary gland, liver, heart, lungs, and brain, whereas Tg157 expressed the transgene in the heart and brain (data not shown). However, no gross phenotypic abnormalities were observed in these organs, suggesting a higher sensitivity of the kidney to p75-CUX1 expression. p75-CUX1 Transgenic Mice Develop Polycystic Kidneys with Long Latency—In contrast to the innocuous extrarenal expression sites, p75-CUX1 expression in the kidney led to cyst formation in both Tg157 and Tg166 heterozygous mice (Fig. 3, A–C and F–H). The severity of the disease was graded as mild, moderate, or severe based on the number and size of kidney cysts (see “Experimental Procedures” for grading system). The weaker expressing Tg157 line generated 22% of mice with moderate to severe polycystic kidneys at 18 months of age (n = 66) (Fig. 3, B and G). This represents a significant increase in cystogenesis from the 9% spontaneous cyst formation observed in control mice at this age (n = 67) (p value <0.05). The percentage of mice with moderate to severe cyst formation increased to 29% in the higher expressing heterozygous Tg166 (p value <0.01) (Fig. 3, C and H), consistently with a dose-dependent effect of the transgene (n = 56). To confirm the dosage effect of p75-CUX1, we characterized the kidneys of homozygous Tg166 mice. At 16 months of age, homozygous Tg166 mice showed very advanced polycystic kidneys, with both kidneys being enlarged, pale, and filled with cysts (Fig. 3, D and I). Such disease levels were never observed in heterozygous Tg166 or Tg157 mice. In addition, all homozygous Tg166 mice sacrificed at 12–13 months displayed kidney anomalies such as renal tubule degeneration, in marked contrast to wild-type controls. Some of these mice had initiated renal tubular hyperplasia with cystic dilation of the lumen (Fig. 3, E and J). Hence, the sustained overexpression of the p75-CUX1 isoform in the kidney leads to polycystic kidney disease in a dose-dependent manner. The Cyst-lining Cells Express the Transgene and Display Enhanced Proliferation—To better characterize the origin of p75-CUX1 cysts, we initially localized p75-CUX1 transgenic expression by anti-HA immunostaining on control and homozygous Tg166 kidneys. In Tg166 samples, HA was detected in most epithelial cells lining the developing cysts. Expression was additionally detected in glomeruli but was largely absent from the stroma (Fig. 4B). As expected, wild-type kidneys were negative for HA staining (Fig. 4A). Anti-CUX1 immunostaining was used to confirm the increased CUX1 expression in cystic epithelia compared with non-transgenic kidney samples. In agreement with HA immunostainings, CUX1 was detected at the highest level in the epithelial cells lining the forming cysts (Fig. 4, C and D). As renal cysts from ADPKD typically arise from both nephron and collecting duct epithelia, whereas the recessive form of the disease (ARPKD) mostly generates collecting duct-derived cysts, we sought to identify the epithelial origin of p75-CUX1 cysts. For this, homozygous Tg166 and control kidneys were stained with the proximal nephron marker lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin. Interestingly, a proportion of p75-CUX1 cysts were found positive for lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin, whereas others were negative (Fig. 4, E and F). These results are thus consistent with an ADPKD-type cystic disease. We then verified whethe"

However, high affinity GDNF binding and downstream signaling depend upon NCAM co-expression with the GDNF co-receptor GFRα1. GFRα1 promotes high affinity GDNF binding to NCAM and down-regulates NCAM-mediated homophilic cell adhesion, but the mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. NCAM and GFRα1 interact at the plasma membrane, but the molecular determinants involved have not been characterized nor is it clear whether their interaction is required for GFRα1 regulation of NCAM function. We have investigated the structure-function relationships underlying GFRα1 binding to NCAM in intact cells. The fourth Ig domain of NCAM was both necessary and sufficient for the interaction of NCAM with GFRα1. Moreover, although the N-terminal domain of GFRα1 had previously been shown to be dispensable for GDNF binding, we found that it was both necessary and sufficient for the efficient interaction of this receptor with NCAM. GFRα1 lacking its N-terminal domain was still able to potentiate GDNF binding to NCAM and assemble into a tripartite receptor complex but showed a reduced capacity to attenuate NCAM-mediated cell adhesion. On its own, the GFRα1 N-terminal domain was sufficient to decrease NCAM-mediated cell adhesion. These results indicate that direct receptor-receptor interactions are not required for high affinity GDNF binding to NCAM but play an important role in the regulation of NCAM-mediated cell adhesion by GFRα1.

Many growth factors exert their effects through binding and activation of multicomponent receptor complexes. Different receptor subunits often play distinct roles in the complex, such as ligand binding and transmembrane signaling. The extent to which direct interactions between individual components in these complexes are required for receptor function is unclear and has been the subject of some debate. For example, neurotrophin high affinity binding has been shown to require both the p75NTR and Trk receptor subunits (4Hempstead B. Martin-Zanca D. Kaplan D. Parada L. Chao M.

Structural and functional studies of GFRα molecules have distinguished N-terminal, central, and C-terminal domains of roughly 100, 200, and 100 residues, respectively, herein termed domains I, II, and III (3Scott R.P.

GFRα proteins cooperate with alternative transmembrane subunits for downstream signaling, such as the RET receptor tyrosine kinase (11Trupp M. Arenas E. Fainzilber M. Nilsson A.-S.

Cell. 2003; 113: 867-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Although RET has on its own no affinity for GDNF, chemical cross-linking studies have shown that it can make direct contact with this ligand in complex with the GFRα1 subunit (11Trupp M. Arenas E.

Unlike RET, NCAM can interact directly with GDNF (2Paratcha G. Ledda F. Ibáñez C.F. Cell. 2003; 113: 867-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of NCAM comprises five N-terminal Ig domains followed by two fibronectin-like domains, and recent work has delineated the sequences in NCAM involved in GDNF binding (1Sjöstrand D. Carlsson J. Paratcha G. Persson B. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12734-12740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The third NCAM Ig domain was found to be necessary and sufficient for GDNF binding, and a combination of molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies identified 4 amino acid residues in this domain that are required for the interaction of NCAM with GDNF. Interestingly, mutation of these residues abolished the ability of NCAM to bind GDNF but left intact its capacity to mediate cell adhesion, indicating that these two functions are genetically separable (1Sjöstrand D. Carlsson J. Paratcha G. Persson B. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12734-12740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although NCAM can interact with GDNF on its own, high affinity binding and downstream signaling require co-expression of the GFRα1 co-receptor (2Paratcha G. Ledda F. Ibáñez C.F. Cell. 2003; 113: 867-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In addition, co-expression of GFRα1 attenuates the ability of NCAM to mediate homophilic cell adhesion in a dose-dependent manner (2Paratcha G. Ledda F. Ibáñez C.F. Cell. 2003; 113: 867-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), a GFRα1 function that is independent of GDNF. NCAM and GFRα1 interact at the plasma membrane in the absence of GDNF, but the molecular determinants involved have not been characterized and the functional significance of NCAM/GFRα1 interaction is unclear. GFRα1 binding to NCAM could conceivably induce conformational changes in the latter that allow enhanced GDNF binding. Alternatively, GFRα1 may potentiate GDNF binding to NCAM by ligand concentration and presentation, without physical contact with NCAM, a model that has also been proposed to explain the role of p75NTR in neurotrophin high affinity binding (16Roux P.P. Barker P.A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 67: 203-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Finally, it is not clear whether direct NCAM/GFRα1 interactions are required for the ability of GFRα1 to inhibit NCAM-mediated cell adhesion. In this study, we have characterized the sequences in NCAM and GFRα1 that mediate their interaction, using a panel of deletion and single domain constructs. A GFRα1 molecule that was markedly impaired in its ability to interact with NCAM but that retained normal GDNF binding was generated. This allowed us to probe the role of NCAM/GFRα1 interactions in NCAM-mediated cell adhesion and high affinity GDNF binding. NCAM and GFRα1 Deletion Constructs—The NCAM deletion constructs have been described previously (1Sjöstrand D. Carlsson J. Paratcha G. Persson B. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12734-12740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Domain boundaries in GFRα1 were assigned based on the structure of domain II of GFRα3 (10Wang X. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Garcia K.C. Structure. 2006; 14: 1083-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The boundaries used were as follows (numbering excludes the 17-residue signal peptide): Domain I, Ser-1-Lys-133; domain II, Gly-134-Trp-337; domain III, Gln-338-Gly-407; glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchoring signal, Leu-408-Ser-451. The GFRα1-ΔI construct was made by PCR, using Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes), with a sense primer corresponding to the beginning of domain II and an antisense primer corresponding to the end of the full-length GFRα1 cDNA. The GFRα1-I and GFRα1-II constructs were made by fusing two PCR fragments. One fragment was made using primers corresponding to the beginning and end of the respective domain. The other fragment was made using a sense primer corresponding to the beginning of the sequence responsible for glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchoring the protein and an antisense primer corresponding to the end of the GFRα1 cDNA. The GFRα1-ΔIII construct was made similarly, with the same second fragment containing the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchoring site but this time with the first fragment made using the full-length sense primer and the domain II end antisense primer in order to exclude only domain III from the construct. The GFRα1-ΔII construct was made similarly as for the GFRα1-I construct, but with the second fragment made with a sense primer corresponding to the beginning of domain III, thus excluding only the second domain from the construct. The PCR fragments were digested with SfiI and NotI (New England Biolabs) and ligated into a SfiI/NotI-digested pSecTag 2A-Hygro vector (Invitrogen) modified with a Myc tag insertion between the secretion tag and the SfiI site. In the cases where two PCR fragments were ligated, the ligation site between the fragments was kept blunt in order to not introduce any extra amino acids between the fused domains. Selective Immunoprecipitation of Surface Molecules—In order to study only receptor molecules expressed at the cell surface, we performed selective immunoprecipitation of cell surface molecules in living cells. COS-7 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in 100-mm plates were transfected with 20 μg of the appropriate DNA constructs with 2 μg of polyethyleneimine/μg of DNA. Two days after transfection, cell monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-HA antibodies (clone 12CA5; Roche Applied Science) or anti-Myc antibodies (clone 71D10; Cell Signaling) in binding buffer (PBS, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml d-glucose, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm MgCl2) for 1 h at 4 °C. The plates were then washed six times with PBS and lysed with 0.75 ml of lysis buffer (PBS, 60 mm octyl-β-glucoside, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors), and cells were collected with a cell lifter. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C with shaking, lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, GammaBind protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the cleared lysates, and the samples were incubated for 1 h with shaking, centrifuged at 500 × g, and washed four times. In the case of PNGaseF (New England Biolabs) treatment, samples were incubated with PNGaseF (without any addition of buffers or additives) for 2 h at 37 °C, either before or after the protein G-Sepharose pulldown. The samples were run on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Autoradiographs were scanned in a STORM 840 Phosphorimager. The membranes were immunoblotted with anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies, developed with enhanced chemifluorescence (GE Healthcare), and scanned in a STORM 840. GDNF Binding and Chemical Cross-linking—COS-7 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in 100-mm plates were transfected with 20 μg of the appropriate DNA constructs with 2 μg of polyethyleneimine/μg of DNA. Two days after transfection, the plates were washed three times with PBS and incubated with I125-GDNF (labeled by the lactoperoxidase method) at a concentration of 20 ng/ml in binding buffer for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After cross-linking for 45 min with EDAC/NHS-S (Pierce), plates were quenched with 50 mm glycine and washed three times with PBS. Cell Adhesion Assay—Jurkat cells were transfected in 12-well plates with NCAM and GFRα constructs together with either green fluorescent protein or Ds-Red-encoding plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) in 2 ml of complete medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. On the following day, 100 μl each of green fluorescent protein- and Ds-Red-transfected cells were combined and mixed with 100 μl of serum-free medium in 48-well plates. After 48 h of incubation, green cells, red cells, and cell aggregates were quantified under green and red fluorescence illumination on a motorized Axiovert 200 microscope controlled by OpenLab software (Improvision). Cell adhesion was calculated as the percentage of green cells present in clusters that also contained red cells and normalized to the value obtained with full-length NCAM. Glycosylation of GFRα1—GFRα1 is a glycoprotein in mammalian cells, subjected to both N- and O-glycosylation. We first set out to determine whether these modifications play any role in the ability of GFRα1 to interact with NCAM. NCAM molecules HA-tagged at their N terminus were selectively immunoprecipitated from the surface of transfected cells as previously described (1Sjöstrand D. Carlsson J. Paratcha G. Persson B. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12734-12740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), fractionated by SDS/PAGE, and immunoblotted to detect co-immunoprecipitated GFRα1 molecules carrying an N-terminal Myc tag. Removal of N-glycosylations by digestion with PNGaseF, either prior to or after immunoprecipitation, did not diminish the ability of NCAM to pull down GFRα1 from the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). An increase in the interaction between the two molecules was detected after PNGaseF digestion (Fig. 1A), indicating a possible negative role of N-glycosylation. O-glycosylation is predicted to be clustered in a threonine-rich segment in the C-terminal domain III of GFRα1. We found that GFRα1-ΔIII, lacking all C-terminal O-glycosylations, interacted with NCAM equally well as the wild type molecule (Fig. 1B). We conclude from these data that neither N- nor O-glycosylation is required for GFRα1 binding to NCAM at the plasma membrane. GFRα1 Binding Determinants in NCAM—To determine sites in NCAM involved in its interaction with GFRα1, we took advantage of a large collection of NCAM deletion constructs previously generated at our laboratory (1Sjöstrand D. Carlsson J. Paratcha G. Persson B. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12734-12740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A schematic diagram of the domain structures of NCAM and GFRα1 is shown in Fig. 2, A and B, along with a depiction of the rationale used for the nomenclature of deletion constructs. The C-terminal deletion analysis shown in Fig. 2C indicates the relative importance of domains 4 (Δ4–7) and 2 (Δ2–7), whereas domains 6–7 (Δ6–7), 5 (Δ5–7), and 3 (Δ3–7) appeared to be dispensable for NCAM binding to GFRα1. The fact that deletion of domains 3 to 7 (Δ3–7) or 1 to 4 (Δ1–4) decreased the interaction with GFRα1 confirmed the importance of domain 4 (Fig. 2D). It would, however, appear that domain 2 can be deleted without affecting binding as long as domain 4 is still present in NCAM (as in Δ1–2 in Fig. 2D). The sufficiency of individual NCAM domains for GFRα1 binding was assessed using constructs carrying single domains as the sole extracellular region of the molecule. Domain 4 was found to bind GFRα1 very well on its own, whereas other domains bound only weakly or not at all (Fig. 2E). In a separate analysis, domain 4 was compared against domains 1, 2, and 1 + 2. Although again domain 4 showed the greatest binding, domain 2 displayed some weak binding that accounted for the interaction observed with 1 + 2 (Fig. 2F). We conclude from this analysis that the main NCAM determinant mediating its association with GFRα1 is located in its fourth Ig domain, with a detectable but less significant contribution from the second domain. NCAM Binding Determinants in GFRα1—Having ruled out the role of GFRα1 domain III in NCAM binding (see Fig. 1B), the necessity and sufficiency of the N-terminal (domain I) and central (domain II) regions of GFRα1 were tested using constructs that either lacked one of these domains (GFRα1-ΔI and GFRα1-ΔII, respectively) or consisted of each single domain on its own (GFRα1-I and GFRα1-II, respectively). The N-terminal domain I of GFRα1 interacted very efficiently with NCAM on its own at levels comparable with those of the full-length molecule, and its deletion markedly reduced the interaction (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the larger GDNF binding region (domain II) of GFRα1 bound weakly on its own to NCAM and could be deleted without affecting the interaction (Fig. 3A). These data indicate that the N-terminal domain of GFRα1 is sufficient on its own and necessary for an efficient interaction with NCAM and therefore contains the main NCAM binding determinant in GFRα1. On the other hand, domain II was not necessary for NCAM binding and although it displayed some binding capacity on its own, this was much weaker. Previous work has shown that domain I of GFRα1 is dispensable for GDNF binding (3Scott R.P. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1450-1458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and for ligand-induced cell adhesion, a novel cell-cell interaction mechanism mediated by GDNF-bound GFRα1 (17Ledda F. Paratcha G. Sandoval-Guzmán T. Ibáñez C.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). NCAM binding therefore represents the first identified function for this domain of the GFRα1 molecule. To test whether the single domains identified in NCAM and GFRα1 were sufficient to interact on their own, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies between GFRα1 domain I and the first four N-terminal Ig domains of NCAM. In agreement with our previous observations, GFRα1-I interacted most strongly with the fourth Ig domain of NCAM (Fig. 3B), indicating that these two domains comprise the main interaction interface between the two molecules. GDNF Binding Potentiation to NCAM and Receptor Complex Formation—The finding that GDNF and NCAM binding activities resided to a large degree in different domains of the GFRα1 molecule indicated that these two functions may be genetically separable and allowed us to test the functional relevance of the GFRα1/NCAM interaction for the ability of GFRα1 to regulate NCAM function. GFRα1 can potentiate GDNF binding to NCAM (2Paratcha G. Ledda F. Ibáñez C.F. Cell. 2003; 113: 867-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), and a tripartite 2:2:2 complex between the three proteins has been detected in intact cells by chemical cross-linking and immunoprecipitation experiments (1Sjöstrand D. Carlsson J. Paratcha G. Persson B. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12734-12740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which GFRα1 enhances GDNF binding to NCAM is unknown. Interaction between GFRα1 and NCAM could conceivably induce a change in conformation in NCAM that allows high affinity GDNF binding. If this were the case, the N-terminal domain I of GFRα1 should on its own also be able to potentiate GDNF binding to NCAM. Alternatively, GFRα1 may enhance GDNF binding by ligand concentration and presentation. Unlike the previous case, this mechanism only requires that GFRα1 is able to bind GDNF, and therefore GFRα1 lacking domain I should be able to enhance GDNF binding to NCAM to the same extent as the full-length receptor. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the abilities of full-length GFRα1, GFRα1-I, and GFRα1-ΔIto potentiate binding of 125I-GDNF to NCAM by chemical cross-linking and immunoprecipitation. As expected, co-expression of full-length GFRα1 significantly increased GDNF binding to NCAM (Fig. 4). However, the N-terminal domain of GFRα1 was on its own unable to potentiate GDNF binding to NCAM (Fig. 5). In contrast, GFRα1 lacking this domain was still able to enhance GDNF binding to NCAM at levels comparable with the full-length molecule (Fig. 4). These results indicate that a preformed complex between GFRα1 and NCAM is not required for high affinity GDNF binding to NCAM. In support of this idea, bands corresponding to the tripartite complexes of NCAM, GDNF, and either full-length GFRα1 or GFRα1-ΔI could be detected after chemical cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4), indicating that GFRα1-ΔI can still be incorporated into a tripartite complex despite being much less efficient at binding NCAM.FIGURE 5Regulation of NCAM-mediated cell adhesion by GFRα1.

Ledda F. Ibáñez C.F. Cell. 2003; 113: 867-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether direct GFRα1/NCAM interactions are required for this activity by comparing the abilities of full-length GFRα1, GFRα1-I, and GFRα1-ΔIto inhibit NCAM-mediated cell adhesion. As expected, full-length GFRα1 inhibited NCAM-mediated cell adhesion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). Importantly, GFRα1-I was as potent as the full-length molecule (Fig. 5), indicating that the N-terminal domain of GFRα1 is by itself sufficient to negatively regulate NCAM-mediated cell adhesion. In comparison, GFRα1-ΔI displayed a markedly reduced potency (Fig. 5). These results support the notion that direct contact between NCAM and GFRα1 molecules is required for regulation of NCAM-mediated cell adhesion and indicate that the N-terminal domain of GFRα1 plays an important role in the ability of GFRα1 to efficiently inhibit this activity. In this study, we have identified the molecular determinants in NCAM and GFRα1 that underlie their interaction at the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. We have shown that neither N- nor O-glycosylation of GFRα1 is required for its binding to GDNF or interaction with NCAM and found that N-glycosylation may in fact play a negative role in the interaction between the two receptor molecules. We have also demonstrated that the fourth Ig domain of NCAM comprises the main determinant mediating the association of this molecule with GFRα1, with a smaller contribution from the second domain. Our previous studies had shown that GDNF interacts with a set of 4 positively charged residues in the third Ig domain of NCAM and that this domain is both necessary and sufficient for NCAM binding to GDNF (1Sjöstrand D. Carlsson J. Paratcha G. Persson B. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12734-12740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because neither the second nor fourth Ig domains of NCAM appears to play any role in GDNF binding, together with the results from our present study these data indicate that different regions of the NCAM molecule mediate its interactions with GDNF and GFRα1. We have also found that the N-terminal domain of GFRα1 constitutes a crucial determinant for the efficient interaction between GFRα1 and NCAM. Because this domain is dispensable for GDNF binding to GFRα1 (3Scott R.P. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1450-1458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), this represents the first function that has been attributed to this region of the GFRα1 molecule. Using single-domain constructs, we could show that the fourth Ig domain of NCAM and the N-terminal domain of GFRα1 can efficiently interact in the absence of any other receptor sequences, suggesting that they represent the main binding interface between the two molecules. Earlier electron microscopy studies have indicated a heavily kinked conformation of the NCAM extracellular domain (18Becker J.W. Erickson H.P. Hoffman S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1088-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Hall A.K. Rutishauser U. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This would conceivably allow a relatively C-terminal region in this molecule, such as the fourth Ig domain, to interact with the N-terminal domain of GFRα1. Importantly, neither the three-dimensional structure nor the topology of the latter is currently known, and it is likely that the linker sequence connecting this domain to the ligand binding region will afford a great degree of flexibility between these two sections of the GFRα1 molecule. Despite its markedly reduced binding to NCAM, GFRα1-ΔI could still be incorporated into a tripartite complex containing GDNF, GFRα1, and NCAM. This suggests that prior complex formation between GFRα1 and NCAM, and hence allosteric changes in the latter, are not required for GDNF high affinity binding to NCAM. This notion is reminiscent of the role of GFRα1 in RET activation by GDNF, in which significant RET binding to either GDNF or GFRα1 can only be detected after formation of a GDNF/GFRα1 complex. It is, however, still unclear whether GDNF high affinity binding to NCAM requires prior GDNF binding to GFRα1 or whether a tripartite interaction can occur simultaneously without preassembly of a binary complex. Some studies have attributed a ligand concentration/presentation role to p75NTR in nerve growth factor signaling and the formation of nerve growth factor high affinity binding sites (20Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Although a comparable role for GFRα1 in GDNF/NCAM interactions cannot yet be formally ruled out, the fact that GFRα1-ΔI could still be assembled into a tripartite complex would appear to favor a stepwise receptor complex assembly mechanism similar to that proposed for RET. The ability of the N-terminal domain of GFRα1 to on its own inhibit NCAM-mediated cell adhesion supports the importance of direct molecular interactions in the regulation of NCAM function by GFRα1. The fact that this domain predominantly interacted with the fourth Ig domain of NCAM would also indicate an important role for the latter in NCAM-mediated cell adhesion. Different molecular models have been proposed to explain NCAM-mediated cell adhesion (21Atkins A.R. Gallin W.J. Owens G.C. Edelman G.M. Cunningham B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49633-49643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 22Johnson C.P. Fujimoto I. Perrin-Tricaud C. Rutishauser U. Leckband D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 41037-41046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), some of which exclude a direct role of the fourth NCAM Ig domain. In this regard, it should also be noted that the N-terminal domain of GFRα1 could conceivably be affecting NCAM-mediated cell adhesion by sterically interfering with trans-homophilic NCAM interactions mediated by other domains in the NCAM molecule. Because the N-terminal domain of GFRα1 was directly attached to the plasma membrane in our GFRα1-I construct, this may have attracted the fourth Ig domain of NCAM toward the membrane and thus induced a conformation in NCAM that is less favorable for cell adhesion. Intriguingly, the crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of GFRα3 has suggested that the N-terminal domain of this molecule may be in close proximity to the plasma membrane (10Wang X. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Garcia K.C. Structure. 2006; 14: 1083-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting a mechanism by which GFRα1 could potentially interfere with NCAM-mediated cell adhesion. In conclusion, we have identified the molecular determinants in NCAM and GFRα1 that underlie their interaction at the plasma membrane and gained mechanistic insights into how GFRα1 may affect different NCAM functions. Moreover, our results suggest that a detailed picture of the tripartite GDNF/GFRα1/NCAM complex could be attained by co-crystallization of GDNF, GFRα1, and the third and fourth Ig domains of NCAM."

https://openalex.org/W2083523626,"The small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex SNAP(c) is required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes and binds to a proximal sequence element in their promoters. SNAP(c) contains five types of subunits stably associated with each other. Here we show that one of these polypeptides, SNAP45, also known as PTF delta, localizes to centrosomes during parts of mitosis, as well as to the spindle midzone during anaphase and the mid-body during telophase. Consistent with localization to these mitotic structures, both down- and up-regulation of SNAP45 lead to a G(2)/M arrest with cells displaying abnormal mitotic structures. In contrast, down-regulation of SNAP190, another SNAP(c) subunit, leads to an accumulation of cells with a G(0)/G(1) DNA content. These results are consistent with the proposal that SNAP45 plays two roles in the cell, one as a subunit of the transcription factor SNAP(c) and another as a factor required for proper mitotic progression."
