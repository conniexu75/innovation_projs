https://openalex.org/W2158658436,"The incidence of tuberculosis has been increasing substantially on a worldwide basis over the past decade, but no tuberculosis-specific drugs have been discovered in 40 years. We identified a diarylquinoline, R207910, that potently inhibits both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro (minimum inhibitory concentration 0.06 mug/ml). In mice, R207910 exceeded the bactericidal activities of isoniazid and rifampin by at least 1 log unit. Substitution of drugs included in the World Health Organization's first-line tuberculosis treatment regimen (rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide) with R207910 accelerated bactericidal activity, leading to complete culture conversion after 2 months of treatment in some combinations. A single dose of R207910 inhibited mycobacterial growth for 1 week. Plasma levels associated with efficacy in mice were well tolerated in healthy human volunteers. Mutants selected in vitro suggest that the drug targets the proton pump of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase."

Our estimated gene count is 18,510, which exceeds the 13,379 genes reported for Drosophila melanogaster . Comparative analyses to fruitfly, mosquito, spider, and butterfly reveal both similarities and differences in gene content."
https://openalex.org/W1973541716,"To establish infection in the host, malaria parasites export remodeling and virulence proteins into the erythrocyte. These proteins can traverse a series of membranes, including the parasite membrane, the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, and the erythrocyte membrane. We show that a conserved pentameric sequence plays a central role in protein export into the host cell and predict the exported proteome in Plasmodium falciparum . We identified 400 putative erythrocyte-targeted proteins corresponding to ∼8% of all predicted genes, with 225 virulence proteins and a further 160 proteins likely to be involved in remodeling of the host erythrocyte. The conservation of this signal across Plasmodium species has implications for the development of new antimalarials."
https://openalex.org/W2097432311,"Malaria parasites secrete proteins across the vacuolar membrane into the erythrocyte, inducing modifications linked to disease and parasite survival. We identified an 11–amino acid signal required for the secretion of proteins from the Plasmodium falciparum vacuole to the human erythrocyte. Bioinformatics predicted a secretome of &gt;320 proteins and conservation of the signal across parasite species. Functional studies indicated the predictive value of the signal and its role in targeting virulence proteins to the erythrocyte and implicated its recognition by a receptor/transporter. Erythrocyte modification by the parasite may involve plasmodial heat shock proteins and be vastly more complex than hitherto realized."
https://openalex.org/W2046879630,"CD4+ T cells classically recognize antigens that are endocytosed and processed in lysosomes for presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. Here, endogenous Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) was found to gain access to this pathway by autophagy. On inhibition of lysosomal acidification, EBNA1, the dominant CD4+ T cell antigen of latent Epstein-Barr virus infection, slowly accumulated in cytosolic autophagosomes. In addition, inhibition of autophagy decreased recognition by EBNA1-specific CD4+ T cell clones. Thus, lysosomal processing after autophagy may contribute to MHC class II-restricted surveillance of long-lived endogenous antigens including nuclear proteins relevant to disease."
https://openalex.org/W1974793156,"We used a cellular system to elucidate the molecular determinants of the large immunophilin FK506-binding proteins (FKBP)51 and -52 for their action on the glucocorticoid receptor in mammalian cells. Increasing the levels of FKBP51 reduced the transcriptional activity of the receptor, as reported. Elevated levels of FKBP52 per se showed no effect but mitigated the inhibition of the receptor induced by FKBP51. We discovered that nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor was delayed by FKBP51. This correlates with the reduced interaction of FKBP51 with the motor protein dynein compared with FKBP52. From mutational analyses, we concluded that three features of the immunophilins are required for efficient receptor signaling in mammalian cells: hsp90 interaction, dynein association, and peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) enzyme activity. The relevance of dynein for receptor function was substantiated by several experiments: 1) coexpression of dynamitin, which disrupts the transport complex and reduces receptor activity; 2) coexpression of the PPIase domain fragment of FKBP52, which is known to disrupt interaction of the receptor to dynein and reduce glucocorticoid receptor function, in contrast to the corresponding fragment of FKBP51; and 3) swapping of the PPIase domains FKBP51 and FKBP52, which reverses the respective activity. We concluded from our results that the mechanisms of the regulatory system FKBP51/FKBP52 discovered in yeast also operate in mammals to modulate hormone binding of the receptor. In addition, differential regulation of dynein association and nuclear translocation contributes to the effects of the two immunophilins on the glucocorticoid receptor in mammals.

In addition, differential regulation of dynein association and nuclear translocation contributes to the effects of the two immunophilins on the glucocorticoid receptor in mammals. Corticosteroids regulate a variety of biological processes, including the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, cell proliferation, development, and reproduction (1Kimberly R.P. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1994; 6: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 2Beato M. Klug J. Hum. Reprod. Update. 2000; 6: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 3Schmid W. Cole T.J.

The mineralocorticoid receptor and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; FKBP, FK506-binding protein; PPIase, peptidylprolyl isomerase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RT, reverse transcription; TAT, tyrosine aminotransferase; MT, metallothionein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type; DEX, dexamethasone.1The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; FKBP, FK506-binding protein; PPIase, peptidylprolyl isomerase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RT, reverse transcription; TAT, tyrosine aminotransferase; MT, metallothionein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type; DEX, dexamethasone. are the two corticosteroid receptors that mediate the effects of corticosteroids. They belong to the family of ligand-dependent transcription factors (4Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P.

Biochem. 1999; 75: 110-122Crossref Google Scholar). In the classic paradigm, GR resides in the cytoplasm in the absence of ligand. Several molecular chaperones assemble the aporeceptor in a stepwise and ATP-dependent fashion to a conformational state capable of binding to hormone with high affinity (6Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). The mature GR complex consists of an hsp90 dimer, p23, possibly hsp70, and one of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing proteins, such as the immunophilin FK506-binding proteins (FKBP) 51 and 52 (7Tai P.K. Albers M.W. Chang H. Faber L.E. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1315-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Upon hormone binding, GR is translocated into the nucleus. It either activates transcription by binding to its cognate DNA elements or decreases transcription by interaction with other transcription factors (8Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 9Karin M. Cell. 1998; 93: 487-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Chaperones are not only required for proper folding of GR but may also be involved in the nuclear translocation of GR (10Pratt W.B. Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 11Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol.

Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) delays nuclear translocation of hormone-bound GR (14Czar M.J. Galigniana M.D. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7776-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Moreover, FKBP52 has been shown to interact not only with hsp90 and GR but also with the motor protein dynein (15Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36980-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), apparently via dynamitin (16Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. O'Hagen H.M. Ljungman M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22483-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These findings led to the formulation of the concept of a transportosome (10Pratt W.B. Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), i.e. a protein heterocomplex that guides GR along cytoskeletal tracts to the nucleus. Without transportosome activity, GR reaches the nucleus with slower kinetics (11Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This model is further supported by the observation that the inhibitory effect of geldanamycin on nuclear translocation depends on an intact cytoskeleton (11Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Hsp90 and FKBP52 have recently been shown to be involved in nuclear transport of p53 (16Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. O'Hagen H.M. Ljungman M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22483-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The important question has been raised as to whether the highly homologous FKBP51 also interacts with dynein (17Pratt W.B. Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. DeFranco D.B. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The suggested role of immunophilins in GR signal transduction also implies novel potential ways to explain occasional GR malfunction associated with many diseases (18Kino T. Chrousos G.P. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 169: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Holsboer F. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2000; 23: 477-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar, 20Zennaro M.C. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been known for several years that malfunction of GR due to low affinity binding to hormone can result from mutations of the GR receptor (21BrönnegårdStierna P. Marcus C. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1996; 8: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or from limited hsp90 function (22Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M.J. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 23Bohen S.P. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 11424-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that cochaperones of hsp90 have the ability to modulate the binding affinity of GR to hormone. For example, increased levels of FKBP51 have been reported to be the common cause of glucocorticoid resistance in three New World primates (25Scammell J.G. Denny W.B. Valentine D.L. Smith D.F. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2001; 124: 152-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanistic contribution of the large immunophilins for GR function remains to be elucidated, important insight into the functional role has been provided (26Davies T.H. Ning Y.M. Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4597-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 27Riggs D.L. Roberts P.J. Chirillo S.C. Cheung-Flynn J. Prapapanich V. Ratajczak T. Gaber R. Picard D. Smith D.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Overexpression of FKBP51 in COS cells reduces the binding affinity of GR and, therefore, decreases the transcriptional activity of GR after hormone exposure (28Denny W.B. Valentine D.L. Reynolds P.D. Smith D.F. Scammell J.G. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4107-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In yeast, overexpression of FKBP51 has no effect on GR, but FKBP52 enhances GR-dependent transcription (27Riggs D.L. Roberts P.J. Chirillo S.C. Cheung-Flynn J. Prapapanich V. Ratajczak T. Gaber R. Picard D. Smith D.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This enhancement is dependent on interaction with hsp90 and the peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity of FKBP52 (27Riggs D.L. Roberts P.J. Chirillo S.C. Cheung-Flynn J. Prapapanich V. Ratajczak T. Gaber R. Picard D. Smith D.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The observation that FKBP52 displayed a similar enhancement of GR in dynein-deficient yeast (27Riggs D.L. Roberts P.J. Chirillo S.C. Cheung-Flynn J. Prapapanich V. Ratajczak T. Gaber R. Picard D. Smith D.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) calls into question the relevance of the described interaction of FKBP52 and other TPR proteins with dynein for GR signaling. Alternatively, it is possible that yeast, which lacks steroid receptors and FKBPs, does not reflect all of the aspects of GR signaling that have developed in higher organisms to ensure optimal steroid signaling. In this study, we investigated the requirements and mechanisms of the differential regulation of GR activity by FKBP51 and FKBP52 in mammalian cells. We show that virtually all features of this regulatory system found in yeast (27Riggs D.L. Roberts P.J. Chirillo S.C. Cheung-Flynn J. Prapapanich V. Ratajczak T. Gaber R. Picard D. Smith D.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) are also functional in mammals, e.g. hsp90 binding of the immunophilins is essential, and the PPIase activity of FKBP52 is required for modulating GR hormone binding and, thus, transcriptional activity. Moreover, we discovered that in mammalian cells nuclear translocation of GR is also regulated by the immunophilins. We detected differential binding of FKBP52 and FKBP51 to dynein, which corresponds to their differential effect on nuclear translocation. Thus, in mammals, FKBP51 and FKBP52 differentially regulate GR on two levels: hormone binding (28Denny W.B. Valentine D.L. Reynolds P.D. Smith D.F. Scammell J.G. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4107-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and nuclear translocation. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Assays for Luciferase and β-Galactosidase—Cultivation and transfection of human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells (American Type Culture Collection catalog number HTB-10), HeLa cells, HEK, and H4-II-E-C3 cells were as described previously (29Schmidt U. Wochnik G.M. Rosenhagen M.C. Hartl F.U. Holsboer F. Rein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4926-4931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Abel A. Wochnik G. Rüegg J. Rouyer A. Holsboer F. Rein T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1352-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Two days before transfection, cells were seeded in medium containing charcoal-stripped serum. Unless indicated otherwise, the amounts of transfected plasmids/∼107 cells were 1.5 μg of steroid-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid MTVLuc, 3 μgof β-galactosidase expression vector pCMVβ-Gal (Stratagene) as control plasmid, various amounts of FKBP expression vector as indicated, and 0.75 μg of pRK7GR that expresses human GR from the CMV promoter of the vector pRK7 (31Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). In all transfections, the total amount of plasmid was equaled for each condition by supplementing “empty” expression vector. After electroporation, the cells were seeded again in medium containing charcoal-stripped serum complemented with either hormone or the respective solvent. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described by Schmidt et al. (29Schmidt U. Wochnik G.M. Rosenhagen M.C. Hartl F.U. Holsboer F. Rein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4926-4931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Luciferase data are presented as % stimulation (i.e. after correction of the data by galactosidase activities, fold stimulation was calculated by comparing cells without hormone to cells with hormone). The stimulation in the absence of cotransfected FKBPs was set to 100%. Tyrosine Aminotransferase (TAT) Assays and Reverse Transcription (RT)/PCR—For the measurement of native GR target genes in glucocorticoid-responsive cell lines, H4-II-E-C3 and HeLa cells were used. First, the cortisol responsivity of the TAT promoter in H4-II-E-C3 cells and of the metallothionein (MT) promoter in HeLa cells was determined. The stimulation of MT was ∼2-fold at 30 nm cortisol and the stimulation of TAT, ∼5-fold at 20 nm cortisol. To evaluate the effect of the immunophilins on the stimulation of these promoters, cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected the next day with 1 μg/well “empty” vector or the FKBP-expressing vectors using ExGen (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For TAT assays, H4-II-E-C3 cells were treated with 20 μg/ml puromycin and 20 nm cortisol or solvent the day after transfection for another 48 h. Given that the transfection efficiency was not 100%, treatment with puromycin was necessary to reduce the fraction of non-transfected cells (these cells do not express the puromycin resistance that is encoded in our expression vectors). The cells were harvested in 100 μl of lysis buffer and assays performed as described by Abel et al. (30Abel A. Wochnik G. Rüegg J. Rouyer A. Holsboer F. Rein T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1352-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For determination of the inducibility of MT by RT/PCR, HeLa cells were treated with 1 μg/ml puromycin and 30 nm cortisol or solvent the day after transfection for another 24 h. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol® as recommended by the manufacturer and RT/PCR performed as described by Rüegg et al. (32Rüegg J. Holsboer F. Turck C. Rein T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9371-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). MT data were normalized by the coamplified GAPDH (32Rüegg J. Holsboer F. Turck C. Rein T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9371-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and TAT activities were normalized to protein content (30Abel A. Wochnik G. Rüegg J. Rouyer A. Holsboer F. Rein T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1352-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The data were calculated as % stimulation (i.e. the stimulation in the absence of transfected immunophilin was set to 100%). Plasmids—The plasmids MTVLuc, green fluorescence protein (GFP)-GR, and pCMVβ-Gal have been described previously (33Wochnik G.M. Young J.C. Schmidt U. Holsboer F. Hartl F.U. Rein T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All immunophilins and dynamitin were cloned downstream of the CMV promoter of the vector pRK5MCS. To create FLAG-tagged versions of the immunophilins, the reverse primer contained the sequence for the tag. The following are plasmids encoding chimeric proteins: Ch1 is a FKBP52 containing the first 138 amino acids of FKBP51 and Ch2 is a FKBP51 containing the first 138 amino acids of FKBP52. The PPIase domain fragments expressing plasmids were constructed by amplifying the cDNA coding for the first 138 amino acids, respectively, and cloning into the pRK5MCS vector. Details of the cloning procedures are available on request. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—For immunoprecipitation of FKBPs, HEK cells were transfected with 10 μg of a plasmid expressing a FLAG-tagged form of the protein of interest. The cells were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na2MoO4,1mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture P2714 from Sigma). The extract was incubated for 1 h on ice, centrifuged for 4 min at 13,000 revolutions/min, and then the protein concentration was determined. Lysates were incubated with the anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel from Sigma (A2220) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were treated as recommended by the manufacturer. The next day, the beads were washed 3 times with 1× Tris-buffered saline, and samples were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer without any reducing agent. For immunoblot detection, either 10 μg of the total protein of the whole cell lysates used for luciferase assays or FLAG immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll, GmbH). Nonspecific binding to membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween buffer, and then the following specific primary antibodies were added: Hsp90 (H-114, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); dynein (clone 70.1, Sigma); FLAG tag (M2, Sigma); hemagglutinin tag (Roche Applied Science); FKBP51 and FKBP52 (StressGen Biotech); and GR (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Signals were visualized by appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of coimmunoprecipitated and immunoprecipitated proteins on the same blotting membrane, the membrane was treated with stripping buffer (Pierce), after detection of the coprecipitated protein and the precipitated protein was detected as described above. Fluorescence Detection—HeLa cells were seeded on glass plates covered with 0.1% gelatin in a 6-well plate (∼2 × 105 cells/well) in steroid-free medium without phenol red. After 1 day, they were transfected using ExGen (Fermentas) as recommended by the manufacturer. 0.25 μg of GFP receptor and 0.75 μg of FKBP plasmid were used for each well. The cells were stimulated 24 h after transfection and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After 20 min, the cells were washed 2 times with incubation buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline/Tween buffer, 5% fetal calf serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% Triton X-100) and then embedded in ProTaqs Mount Fluor (Biocyc GmbH & Co KG, Luckenwalde, Germany). For time-resolved analysis of nuclear translocation, we followed the protocol by Galigniana et al. (34Galigniana M.D. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14884-14889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The cells were analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (Axioplan 2 imaging, Zeiss, Jena, Germany). To score the cytoplasmic/nuclear distribution of the fluorescing receptors, >100 cells were evaluated by a non-involved investigator according to a method adapted from the literature (11Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). 0 was assigned to a cell with a balanced distribution, + 1 for a cell with enhanced nuclear (–1 with enhanced cytoplasmic) fluorescence, and + 2 for a cell with exclusively nuclear (–2 with exclusively cytoplasmic) fluorescence. FKBP51 and FKBP52 Act Differentially on GR in Mammalian Cells—To set up a mammalian model system to investigate the effect of FKBP51 and FKBP52 on GR, we used the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-MC, HEK cells, and HeLa cells in a GR-responsive reporter assay. In all of these cell lines, we observed a dose-dependent inhibition of GR-mediated transcription by FKBP51 as reported for COS cells (28Denny W.B. Valentine D.L. Reynolds P.D. Smith D.F. Scammell J.G. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4107-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), whereas FKBP52 had no effect (Fig. 1A). Overexpression of the carboxy terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein, another TPR domain protein, leads to degradation of GR through the proteasome machinery (35Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In yeast, overexpression of FKBP52 or FKBP51 increased the levels of GR. In our mammalian cells, overexpression of FKBP51 or FKBP52 did not change the level of GR (Fig. 1A). This excludes degradation of GR as an explanation for the inhibitory effect of FKBP51. We also observed that, in the presence of FKBP51, higher concentrations of cortisol were necessary to elicit a GR response (Fig. 1B). This reflects the change in Kd of GR hormone binding observed by others (28Denny W.B. Valentine D.L. Reynolds P.D. Smith D.F. Scammell J.G. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4107-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We noted that, at saturating levels of cortisol, FKBP51 still slightly but significantly decreased GR activity, indicating an additional level of action of FKBP51 on GR (i.e. additive to the Kd effect). GR activities were the same for the vector control and FKBP52 coexpression (not shown). It was important to test whether the same pattern of activity of FKBP51 and FKBP52 can be observed on an endogenous GR-regulated gene as in our transient reporter system. We used the glucocorticoid-responsive cell lines HeLa and H4-II-E-C3 to measure the influence of additional FKBP51 or FKBP52 on the established GR target genes MT (metallothionein) and TAT (tyrosine aminotransferase), respectively (36Karin M. Haslinger A. Heguy A. Dietlin T. Imbra R. Experientia Suppl. 1987; 52: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 37Nitsch D. Boshart M. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5479-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We observed that the FKBP51 abolished the enhancement of MT RNA after the addition of hormone, whereas FKBP52 had no significant effect (Fig. 1C and data not shown). Likewise, TAT activity was significantly reduced by FKBP51 but not by FKBP52 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the inhibitory action of FKBP51 is independent of the cell line used and, importantly, also independent of the promoter and its chromosomal context. Although FKBP52 enhanced GR signaling in yeast (27Riggs D.L. Roberts P.J. Chirillo S.C. Cheung-Flynn J. Prapapanich V. Ratajczak T. Gaber R. Picard D. Smith D.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), the environment provided for GR activity is obviously different in mammals and yeast. Both WT and FLAG-tagged proteins produced indistinguishable results (not shown). The Inhibitory Activity of FKBP51 Requires Interaction with Hsp90 and Is Competed by FKBP52—Hsp90 dependence has been demonstrated for the FKBP52-induced enhancement of GR in yeast (27Riggs D.L.

However, GR and FKBP51/52 evolved only in higher organisms, and the immunophilins also exhibit hsp90-independent features (15Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M.

To test the hsp90 dependence of the FKBP51-inhibitory effect on GR in our mammalian reporter system, we replaced the positively charged amino acids lysine 352 and arginine 356 with alanines in the hsp90-interacting TPR repeat motif, (see Fig. 6 for domain structure). The corresponding mutation in the TPR domain of protein phosphatase 5 has been shown to disrupt binding to hsp90 (40Russell L.C. Whitt S.R. Chen M.S. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20060-20063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The TPR-defective FKBP51 did not inhibit GR-dependent transcription (Fig. 2A). The protein was expressed at the same level as WT FKBP51 and coimmunoprecipitation confirmed that there is no interaction with hsp90 (Fig. 2A, lower panels). HEK and SK-N-MC cells yielded the same results. The requirement for hsp90 interaction was also confirmed by the inability of FKBP51 to inhibit a constitutively active GR that lacks the hsp90-interacting ligand binding domain (not shown).Fig. 2Inhibition of GR by FKBP51 requires interaction with hsp90 and is mitigated by FKBP52. A, SK-N-MC cells were transfected with the reporter plasmid MTVLuc, increasing amounts of a plasmid expressing FKBP51 with a double point mutation in the TPR domain (K352A/R356A), the β-galactosidase plasmid, and the GR plasmid (pRK7GR).

We observed oscillatory behavior of the superconducting transition temperature when the film thickness was increased by one atomic layer at a time. This oscillating behavior was shown to be a manifestation of the Fabry-Pérot interference modes of electron de Broglie waves (quantum well states) in the films, which modulate the electron density of states near the Fermi level and the electron-phonon coupling, which are the two factors that control superconductivity transitions. This result suggests the possibility of modifying superconductivity and other physical properties of a thin film by exploiting well-controlled and thickness-dependent quantum size effects."

The syndrome is caused by the loss of the RecQ helicase WRN, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. Here we report that cells lacking WRN exhibit deletion of telomeres from single sister chromatids. Only telomeres replicated by lagging strand synthesis were affected, and prevention of loss of individual telomeres was dependent on the helicase activity of WRN. Telomere loss could be counteracted by telomerase activity. We propose that WRN is necessary for efficient replication of G-rich telomeric DNA, preventing telomere dysfunction and consequent genomic instability."
https://openalex.org/W2119631764,"Addictive drugs have been hypothesized to access the same neurophysiological mechanisms as natural learning systems. These natural learning systems can be modeled through temporal-difference reinforcement learning (TDRL), which requires a reward-error signal that has been hypothesized to be carried by dopamine. TDRL learns to predict reward by driving that reward-error signal to zero. By adding a noncompensable drug-induced dopamine increase to a TDRL model, a computational model of addiction is constructed that over-selects actions leading to drug receipt. The model provides an explanation for important aspects of the addiction literature and provides a theoretic view-point with which to address other aspects."
https://openalex.org/W1965320478,"Plants are constantly exposed to attack by an array of diverse pathogens but lack a somatically adaptive immune system. In spite of this, natural plant populations do not often suffer destructive disease epidemics. Elucidating how allelic diversity within plant genes that function to detect pathogens (resistance genes) counteracts changing structures of pathogen genes required for host invasion (pathogenicity effectors) is critical to our understanding of the dynamics of natural plant populations. The RPP13 resistance gene is the most polymorphic gene analyzed to date in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we report the cloning of the avirulence gene, ATR13, that triggers RPP13-mediated resistance, and we show that it too exhibits extreme levels of amino acid polymorphism. Evidence of diversifying selection visible in both components suggests that the host and pathogen may be locked in a coevolutionary conflict at these loci, where attempts to evade host resistance by the pathogen are matched by the development of new detection capabilities by the host."

Oocytes from Gpr3 knockout mice resume meiosis within antral follicles, independently of an increase in luteinizing hormone, and this phenotype can be reversed by injection of Gpr3 RNA into the oocytes. Thus, the GPR3 receptor is a link in communication between the somatic cells and oocyte of the ovarian follicle and is crucial for the regulation of meiosis."

https://openalex.org/W2001505809,"The contribution of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling to the resistance exercise-induced stimulation of skeletal muscle protein synthesis was assessed by administering rapamycin to Sprague-Dawley rats 2 h prior to a bout of resistance exercise. Animals were sacrificed 16 h postexercise, and gastrocnemius protein synthesis, mTOR signaling, and biomarkers of translation initiation were assessed. Exercise stimulated the rate of protein synthesis; however, this effect was prevented by pretreatment with rapamycin. The stimulation of protein synthesis was mediated by an increase in translation initiation, since exercise caused an increase in polysome aggregation that was abrogated by rapamycin administration. Taken together, the data suggest that the effect of rapamycin was not mediated by reduced phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein 1 (BP1), because exercise did not cause a significant change in 4E-BP1(Thr-70) phosphorylation, 4E-BP1-eIF4E association, or eIF4F complex assembly concomitant with increased protein synthetic rates. Alternatively, there was a rapamycin-sensitive decrease in relative eIF2Bϵ(Ser-535) phosphorylation that was explained by a significant increase in the expression of eIF2Bϵ protein. The proportion of eIF2Bϵ mRNA in polysomes was increased following exercise, an effect that was prevented by rapamycin treatment, suggesting that the increase in eIF2Bϵ protein expression was mediated by an mTOR-dependent increase in translation of the mRNA encoding the protein. The increase in eIF2Bϵ mRNA translation and protein abundance occurred independent of similar changes in other eIF2B subunits. These data suggest a novel link between mTOR signaling and eIF2Bϵ mRNA translation that could contribute to the stimulation of protein synthesis following acute resistance exercise."
https://openalex.org/W1990583076,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of the neurotoxic peptide β-amyloid, which is produced by proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a large membrane-bound copper-binding protein that is essential in maintaining synaptic function and may play a role in synaptogenesis. β-Amyloid has been shown to contribute to the oxidative stress that accompanies AD. Later stages of AD are characterized by neuronal apoptosis. However, the biochemical function of APP and the mechanism of the toxicity of β-amyloid are still unclear. In this study, we show that both β-amyloid and APP can oxidize cholesterol to form 7β-hydroxycholesterol, a proapoptotic oxysterol that was neurotoxic at nanomolar concentrations. 7β-Hydroxycholesterol inhibited secretion of soluble APP from cultured rat hippocampal H19–7/IGF-IR neuronal cells and inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme α-secretase activity but had no effect on β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 activity. 7β-Hydroxycholesterol was also a potent inhibitor of α-protein kinase C, with a Ki of ∼0.2 nm.

Feeding cholesterol and copper to rabbits produces some of the pathological signs reminiscent of Alzheimer's disease, including amyloid-like plaques, and interferes with the ability of rabbits to perform difficult memory tasks (3Sparks D.L. Schreurs B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11065-11069Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The ϵ4 mutant in the gene for apolipoprotein E (apoE), an important cholesterol transport protein associated with low density lipoprotein (LDL), has been shown to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, and cholesterol-lowering drugs reduce the prevalence of AD. Cholesterol can also regulate the generation of the toxic β-amyloid peptide in affected brain regions and can inhibit β-amyloid clearance. Aberrations in cholesterol transport produced by redistribution of presenilin have been shown to increase cellular levels of β-amyloid (4Burns M. Gaynor K. Olm V. Mercken M. LaFrancois J. Wang L.

Much attention has also focused on β-amyloid, a neurotoxic peptide produced by proteolysis of APP. APP fragments can regulate cell excitability, synaptic transmission, and long term potentiation.

It was proposed that this reductant might deplete intracellular glutathione, paradoxically causing oxidative stress. Conversely, copper supplementation decreases β-amyloid formation in Chinese hamster ovary cells (22Borchardt T. Schmidt C. Camarkis J. Cappai R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-le-grand). 2000; 46: 785-795PubMed Google Scholar). Another characteristic of Alzheimer's disease is oxidative stress. β-Amyloid produces oxidative stress by three mechanisms: by the radical nature of β-amyloid at Met35, which can react with oxygen in a metal-independent fashion (23Hensley K. Carney J.M. Mattson M.P. Aksenova M. Harris M. Wu J.F. Floyd R.A. Butterfield D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, despite intensive research, the precise relationship between APP, copper, and cholesterol, the mechanism by which β-amyloid causes cell death and synaptic dysfunction, and the biochemical role of cholesterol and oxidative stress in AD are still unclear. To gain further insight as to how β-amyloid causes oxidative stress, we examined the interaction between APP and cholesterol and found that β-amyloid and APP possess oxidative activity toward cholesterol and produces 7-hydroxycholesterol, a toxic oxysterol.

Fresh synthetic human β-amyloid 1–42 (Sigma) was dissolved in 50% Me2SO and stored in a glass vial at -80° C until use. The concentration and purity of β-amyloid were monitored by HPLC. Enzymatic Oxidation of Cholesterol—[7-3H]Cholesterol (Amersham Biosciences) in toluene solution (2 μl) was evaporated and redissolved in 2 μl of ethanol in a 0.5-ml capped polypropylene centrifuge tube. Varying amounts of β-amyloid 1–42 or purified APP were added, and the volume was brought to 15 μl with deionized water. The final concentrations were: Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm; Triton X-100, 0.66%; CuCl2, 2 μm; EDTA, 0.1 μm; Me2SO, 0.3–3%. The centrifuge tubes were sealed and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and immediately stored at -20 °C until analysis. In some experiments, the reaction was carried out in a suspension of rat hippocampal neurons in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, in the absence of Me2SO, Triton, Tris, and Tween, and the volume was increased to 100 μl. In these experiments, the reaction products were extracted with CHCl3, evaporated under nitrogen, and redissolved in 15 μl of ethanol prior to HPLC analysis. Old solutions of cholesterol were found to contain unidentified contaminants that inhibited the reaction. Therefore, the cholesterol radioactive source vials were stored at -80 °C and used within 2 weeks of purchase. HPLC—Samples (10 μl) were injected onto a Macrosphere RP 300 Å 5-μm C18 reversed-phase HPLC column equilibrated with solvent A (H2O 63.93%, MeOH 36.0%, trifluoroacetic acid 0.07%) and eluted with a gradient of 100% solvent A to 100% ethanol in 0–40 min, followed by 100% ethanol for 40–60 min, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 210 nm and 0.3-min fractions (except as noted) were collected in glass scintillation vials. Two milliliters of Biofluor (Research Products International) was added, and the radioactivity was counted in a Beckman LS 3801 liquid scintillation counter. Thin-layer Chromatography—Samples were applied to a Silica G-25/UV 254 TLC plate (0.25-mm thickness), eluted with toluene/ethanol (2:1) or hexane/ethyl acetate (2:1), and sprayed with 1% potassium iodide or 2% H2SO4 followed by heating at 200 °C. For radioactive samples, 1- or 2-mm widths of silica gel were scraped into scintillation vials. Two milliliters of Biofluor was added, and the radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Preparation of ApoE-Sepharose 4B—Apolipoprotein E3 (100 μg, Calbiochem) was dialyzed for 72 h at 4 °C against 10 mm NaHCO3 (pH 8.0). Cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (0.25 g, Amersham Biosciences) was then suspended in 1 mm HCl, shaken gently at room temperature for 15 min to rehydrate it, then collected by centrifugation. The apoE was diluted to 5 ml in coupling buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3 plus 0.5 m NaCl), added to the rehydrated CNBr-Sepharose, and reacted at room temperature with gentle shaking for 4 h. Unreacted binding sites were then blocked by addition of Tris-HCl (pH 8) to 0.1 m, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 1 h. The Sepharose was then transferred to a small polypropylene column and washed three times with alternating solutions of 0.1 m Na acetate, pH 4, plus 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, plus 0.5 m NaCl. The column was then washed with 20 ml of 4 m NaCl and re-equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The washed Sepharose 4B was removed from the column and stored at 4 °C until use. Purification of APP—Two frozen rat brains or two frozen guinea pig brains were sonicated in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm benzamidine. The homogenate was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the cytosolic supernatant was saved. The pellet was resonicated in 10 ml of 10% Triton X-100 and re-centrifuged, and the supernatant containing the solubilized extract was saved. The cytosol and the solubilized extract were then added to separate tubes containing apoE-Sepharose and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The Sepharose was then collected by centrifugation and transferred to two separate columns at room temperature and washed extensively with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, followed by 20 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl. The APP was then eluted by sequentially applying 2.5 ml of 5 m NaCl plus 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 ml of 1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.5), and 2.5 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, plus 1 m NaCl. The eluates were collected directly into Centricon-30 ultrafiltration devices. The Centricon devices were then centrifuged at 5000 × g overnight. Centrifugation was repeated with two additions of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The fractions containing purified APP were identified by Western blotting, and the desalted protein was stored at -80 °C. Two-dimensional Western Blot—Samples of purified APP were applied to an Invitrogen immobilzed pH gradient, pH 3–10, polyacrylamide isoelectric focusing strip that had been rehydrated with isoelectric focusing sample buffer (8.5 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 0.4% CHAPS, 0.5% immobilized pH gradient buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and subjected to isoelectric focusing on an LKB flatbed Multiphor apparatus as described previously (27Nelson T.J. Backlund P.S. Alkon D.L. Hippocampus. 2004; 14: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The focusing strip was then equilibrated for 15 min with SDS equilibration buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1.2 m urea, 6% glycerol, 0.2% SDS, and 0.1% bromphenol blue), transferred to a Bis-Tris minigel (Invitrogen, Zoom Gel), and subjected to SDS electrophoresis, nitrocellulose blotting, and antibody staining using anti-APP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody as described previously (27Nelson T.J. Backlund P.S. Alkon D.L. Hippocampus. 2004; 14: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). H2O2 Measurement—Samples containing unlabeled cholesterol (170 μm), CuCl2, or Cu(II)-glycine chelate (16Atwood C.S. Scarpa R.C. Huang X. Moir R.D. Jones W.D. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J.

Hydrogen peroxide was then measured fluorometrically using horseradish peroxidase assays based on homovanillic acid (28Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To 10-μl samples, homovanillic acid, horseradish peroxidase, and Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, were added to final concentrations of 83 μm, 0.05 unit/μl, and 0.1 m, respectively. Samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, diluted to 3 ml, and fluorescence was measured using a Spex Fluorolog-2 spectrofluorometer using excitation and emission wavelengths of 321 and 421 nm, respectively. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry was carried out by M-Scan, Inc. (West Chester, PA) using a VG analytical ZAB 2-SE high field mass spectrometer. The source temperature was maintained at 200 °C, and the spectra were acquired with an electron voltage of 70 eV. The sample was transferred to a solids probe using dichloromethane, inserted into the instrument via the solids probe, and heated until an appropriate spectrum was obtained. Computer Gel Analysis—Image quantitation and molecular weight estimation were done using the Unix-based image analysis program tnimage (available at www.brneurosci.org/tnimage.html). Enzyme kinetic parameters were obtained by nonlinear fitting using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm. Cell Culture—Rat hippocampal H19–7/IGF-IR cells (ATCC) were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated plates and grown at 35 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum for several days until ∼50% coverage was obtained. The cells were then induced to differentiate into a neuronal phenotype by replacing the medium with 5 ml of N2 medium containing 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor and grown in T-25 flasks at 39 °C. Varying concentrations of the cholesterol metabolite were then added in 10 μl of ethanol. After 48 h the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, removed by gentle scraping, and collected by centrifugation at 500 rpm (30 × g) for 5 min. sAPP Measurement—Cell culture medium was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min and filtered through a Pasteur pipette containing a cotton plug to remove any detached or dead cells. A 1-ml aliquot of the filtrate was then precipitated by adding 0.1 ml of 100% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and centrifuging (15,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min). The pellet was redissolved in 100 μl of H2O by directing NH4 vapor into the test tube and mixed with SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were incubated with anti-β-amyloid antibody (Santa Cruz sc-5399) and developed with an alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium. The images were photographed using a Fujifilm LAS-1000 Plus charge-coupled device gel documentation system, and 16-bit images were quantitated by densitometry. TACE Assay—TACE (TNF-α-converting enzyme, ADAM-17) activity was measured using a fluorometric fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay (29Jin G. Huang X. Black R. Wolfson M. Rauch C. McGregor H. Ellestad G. Cowling R. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cultured cells or rat brain homogenate were incubated with 10 μm TACE substrate IV (Abz-LAQAVRSSSR-DPa, Calbiochem) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaCl, and 4% glycerol at room temperature for 40 min. The reaction was stopped by diluting to 3 ml, and the fluorescence was measured in a Spex Fluorolog-2 spectrofluorometer using excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 420 nm, respectively. BACE1—BACE1 activity was measured using a fluorometric fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay using a kit based on the BACE1 substrate 7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl[Asn670,Leu671]-Amyloid β/A4 protein precursor 770 fragment 667–676-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-Lys-Lys-Arg amide trifluoroacetate (Sigma). Samples were incubated with 100 μm substrate in a total volume of 100 μl for 2 h at 37 °C, and fluorescence was measured in a Spex Fluorolog-2 using excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 405 nm, respectively. Protein Kinase C Assay—Recombinant PKC (1.1, 2.4, 2.4, 2.0, 2.0, 0.9, 2.5, and 1.1 ng of α, βI, βII, γ, δ, ϵ, ζ, and η isoforms, respectively) was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of 10 μm histones, 4.89 mm CaCl2, 1.2 μg/μl phosphatidyl-l-serine, 0.18 μg/μl 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.8 mm EDTA, 4 mm EGTA, 4% glycerol, 8 μg/ml aprotinin, 8 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm benzamidine. 0.5 μCi of [32P]ATP was added, and [32P]phosphoprotein formation was measured by adsorption onto phosphocellulose as described previously (30Nelson T.J. Alkon D.L. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2350-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To determine whether β-amyloid possessed oxidative activity toward cholesterol, we incubated 50 nm fresh human amyloid β-protein fragment 1–42 with [1,3-3H]cholesterol in the presence of 2 μm CuCl2, 0.1 μm EDTA, and 0.66% Tween 20 or Triton X-100 for 2 h at 37 °C. The lipid fraction was extracted into chloroform, evaporated, dissolved in 15 μl of EtOH, and injected onto a C18 HPLC column. The cholesterol metabolites were separated and detected by monitoring absorbance at 210 nm. Fractions were collected every 0.2 min, mixed with scintillation counting fluid, and counted in a scintillation counter. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table I, incubation of radiolabeled cholesterol with β-amyloid in the presence of 2 μm divalent copper produced a new product (tR ≈ 48 min) that was absent in samples incubated with β-amyloid or Cu2+ alone. The retention time of this peak coincided with that of 5-cholesten-3,7-diol (7-hydroxycholesterol). The retention time of this peak did not coincide with any of a number of other neurosteroids or cholesterol metabolites tested. 2The following sterols were tested: 3β-hydroxy-5α-cholestane (dihydrocholesterol), 5-cholesten-3β,7α-diol (7α-hydroxycholesterol), 5-cholesten-3β,7β-diol (7β-hydroxycholesterol), 5α-cholestan-3β,6α-diol (6α-hydroxycholestanol), 5α-cholestan-3β,6β-diol (6β-hydroxycholestanol), cholestan-3β,5α-diol (5α-hydroxycholestanol), 5-cholesten-3β,4α-diol (4α-hydroxycholesterol), 5-cholesten-3β,4β-diol (4β-hydroxycholesterol), 5-cholesten-3β,20α-diol (20α-hydroxycholesterol), 5-cholesten-3β,22(R)-diol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, cholestan-5α,6α-epoxy-3β-ol (cholesteryl-5,6α-epoxide), cholestan-5β,6β-epoxy-3β-ol (cholesteryl-5,6β-epoxide), 4-cholesten-3-one, 5-cholesten-3-one, 5-androsten-3β-ol-17-one (dehydroisoandrosterone), pregnenolone, pregnenolone sulfate, 5α-pregnan-3-ol-20-one, corticosterone, deoxycorticosterone, progesterone, estrone, 4-androstene-3,17-dione, cholesterol-5α-hydroperoxide (26Kulig M.J.

The RF of the metabolite was identical to that of cholestan-3,6-diol and 5-cholesten-3,7-diol and different from the RF values of the other cholesterol derivatives tested. To further identify the cholesterol metabolite, we incubated 1 μm β-amyloid 1–42 with 1 mg of cholesterol, 0.66% Tween 20 or Triton X-100, 3 μm CuCl2, 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1 μm EDTA at 37 °C for 3 h, extracted the lipids into CHCl3, and purified the cholesterol metabolite by repeated injections onto a C18 reversed-phase HPLC column.

https://openalex.org/W2145303019,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) represent a highly specialized immune cell subset that produces large quantities of the anti-viral cytokines type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β) upon viral infection. PDC employ a member of the family of toll-like receptors, TLR9, to detect CpG motifs (unmethylated CG dinucleotides in certain base context) present in viral DNA. A certain group of CpG motif-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN), CpG-A, was the first synthetic stimulus available that induced large amounts of interferon-α (IFN-α) in PDC. However, the mechanism responsible for this activity remained elusive. CpG-A is characterized by a central palindrome and poly(G) at the 5′ and 3′ end. Here we demonstrate that CpG-A self-assembles to higher order tertiary structures via G-tetrad formation of their poly(G) motifs. Spontaneous G-tetrad formation of CpG-A required the palindrome sequence allowing structure formation in a physiological environment. Once formed, G-tetrad-linked structures were stable even under denaturing conditions. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the tertiary structures formed by CpG-A represent nucleic acid-based nanoparticles in the size range of viruses. Similarly sized preformed polystyrene nanoparticles loaded with a CpG ODN that is otherwise weak at inducing IFN-α (CpG-B) gained the potency of CpG-A to induce IFN-α. Higher ODN uptake in PDC was not responsible for the higher IFN-α-inducing activity of CpG-A or of CpG-B-coated nanoparticles as compared with CpG-B. Based on these results we propose a model in which the spatial configuration of CpG motifs as particle is responsible for the virus-like potency of CpG-A to induce IFN-α in PDC.

(anti-viral cytokines, IFN-α and IFN-β) in vivo may pave the way for improved therapies for viral infection such as chronic hepatitis or for malignancies. A particular immune cell subset, the so-called plasmacytoid dendritic cell (PDC), has been identified as the major type I interferon-producing cell upon viral infection (1Cella M. Jarrossay D.

Viruses for a long time have been the only stimuli to induce large amounts of IFN-α in PDC. Recently it became clear that certain members of the family of toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in the regulation of IFN-α synthesis in PDC. In general, TLRs (TLR1–TLR10) are specialized for the detection of conserved pathogen-associated molecules such as endotoxin (component of Gram-negative bacteria, detected by TLR4) leading to activation of the corresponding immune cell subset (3Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3898) Google Scholar). The only two TLRs expressed in PDC are TLR7 and TLR9 (4Hornung V. Rothenfusser S. Britsch S. Krug A.

Although DNA containing so-called CpG motifs (unmethylated CG dinucleotides with certain flanking bases, CpG-DNA) has been identified as a ligand for TLR9 early on (7Hartmann G. Weiner G.J. Krieg A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9305-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), CpG motif containing synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) only induce large amounts of IFN-α in PDC when they fulfill certain sequence requirements (palindrome, two poly(G) ends, phosphorothioate-modified linkages at the 5′ and 3′ ends) in addition to the CpG motif; this group of CpG ODN is termed CpG-A (8Krug A.

CpG-B are weak at inducing IFN-α but are more active than CpG-A to stimulate costimulatory molecules and proinflammatory cytokines and to promote survival and differentiation of PDC (5Krug A.

In studies with TLR9-deficient mice it has been demonstrated that both CpG-A and CpG-B depend on TLR9 (16Hemmi H. Kaisho T. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Sanjo H. Hoshino K. Horiuchi T. Tomizawa H. Takeda K.

Akira, personal communication.2S. Akira, personal communication. Because TLR9 is required for both CpG-A and CpG-B, it is intriguing that ligation of the same receptor, TLR9, can elicit distinct responses in PDC.ODNs with poly(G) motifs (at least four guanosines) are known to self-associate via Hoogsteen base pairing into quadruplex structures, so-called G-tetrads (17Williamson J.R.

Based on our results we propose a concept in which the palindrome sequence of CpG-A via duplex formation of two CpG-A molecules facilitates the generation of G-tetrads and in which the spatial configuration of CpG motifs as a nanoparticle is critical for the high IFN-α inducing activity characteristic for CpG-A.MATERIALS AND METHODSMedia and Reagents—RPMI cell culture medium (PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria) supplemented with 8% human serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), 1.5 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma, Munich, Germany) was used throughout the studies.

Higher order structure formation of ODN in PBS was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Non-denaturing gel electrophoresis: 20% polyacrylamide, 1× TBE; loading buffer: 20% sucrose, 1× TBE, 0.05% bromphenol blue (Sigma), 0.05% xylene cyanole (Sigma). The gel was run at a constant electric field of 8 V/cm; denaturing gel electrophoresis: 20% polyacrylamide, 1× TBE, 8 m urea; loading buffer: 80% formamide; 1× TBE; 0.05% bromphenol blue; 0,05% xylene cyanole. The gel was run at a constant electric field of 40 V/cm. For denaturing gel analysis an oligonucleotide sizing marker was labeled with [32P]ATP. For the analysis of structure formation in different buffers and temperatures, 5′-digoxigenin-labeled ODN were purchased from Metabion (Martinsried, Germany). Immunological detection of digoxigenin-labeled ODN was performed by using the anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase and the digoxigenin Wash and Block buffer set (both from Roche Applied Sciences) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Structure formation under the following buffers were analyzed (22Sen D. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar): buffer A, 143 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.25 (interstitial milieu); buffer B, 10 mm NaCl, 155 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.25 (intracellular milieu); buffer C, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.25 (15:1 buffer). These analyses were performed using 16% polyacrylamide gels under non-denaturing conditions with 10 mm and 0.5× TBE. These gels were run for 30 min at 100 V followed by 3 h at 200 V.Atomic Force Microscopy—ODN diluted in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PAA Laboratories) were deposited on pretreated mica (25 mm MgCl2 spin coating for 1 min), incubated for 5 min, washed with purified water, and dried under vacuum as described earlier (24Costa L.T.

All images were performed using a Topometrix Explorer (Darmstadt, Germany) operating in dynamic mode at ambient conditions using cantilevers NSC11 (Ultrasharp) with a spring constant 3 N/m and a resonance frequency of ∼ 45 kHz. The nominal tip radius was < 10.0 nm. Image analysis was performed using SPIP software (Lyngby, Denmark).Isolation of Cells and Cell Culture—Buffy coats from 18- to 65-year-old healthy donors tested to be negative for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus were provided by the blood bank of the University of Greifswald. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared from buffy coats by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation (Biochrom) as described (25Rothenfusser S. Hornung V. Ayyoub M. Britsch S.

PDC were isolated by magnetically activated cell sorting using the BDCA-4 dendritic cell isolation kit from Milteny Biotec (Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany). Briefly, PDC were labeled with anti-BDCA-4 antibody coupled to colloidal paramagnetic microbeads and passed through a magnetic separation column twice (LS and RS column, Milteny Biotec). The purity of isolated PDC (lineage-negative, MHC II-positive, and CD123-positive cells) was >90%. (Viability was >95% as determined by trypan blue exclusion). Isolated PDC (5 × 104 cells/well) or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (4 × 105 cells/well) were cultured in 96-well round-bottom plates in the presence of different stimuli as indicated. CpG ODN were used at a final concentration of 3 μg/ml. Supernatants were collected after different periods of time for cytokine analysis.Nanoparticle Preparation and Formation of Nanoparticle-ODN Conjugates—Polystyrene nanoparticles were prepared by batch polymerization under surfactant-free conditions as described by Fritz et al. (26Fritz H. Maier M. Bayer E. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1997; 195: 272-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cationic initiator AIBI was applied to induce positive surface charge. Additional steric stabilization was achieved by the addition of the nonionic surfactant poloxamer 338. The size of the nanospheres was determined by photon correlation spectroscopy using a photon correlation spectrometer Zetasizer 4 (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) and amounts to 180 nm. Adsorption of CpG ODN to polystyrene nanoparticles was performed as described by Fritz et al. (26Fritz H. Maier M. Bayer E. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1997; 195: 272-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Flow Cytometry—Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled ODN were purchased from Metabion (Martinsried, Germany). For the analysis of ODN uptake PDC were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled ODN or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled ODN adsorbed to polystyrene nanoparticles (final concentration of ODN, 3 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Surface binding of ODN was determined by incubation at 4 °C. After 1.5 h cells were washed twice and fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur with two lasers, excitation at 488 and 635 nm wavelength, BD Biosciences). Dead cells were excluded from the analysis by morphologic criteria. Data were analyzed using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences).Detection of Cytokines—The IFN-α module set from Bender MedSystems (detection range 8–500 pg/ml) and the human TNF-α enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (detection range, 8–500 pg/ml) from BD Pharmingen were used.Statistical Analysis—Data are shown as means ± S.E. Statistical significance of differences was determined by the paired two-tailed Student's t test. Differences were considered statistically significant for p < 0.05 (*, p < 0.05 and **, p < 0.01). Statistical analyses were performed using StatView 4.51 software (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Calabasas, CA).RESULTSInduction of IFN-α in Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells by CpG-A Requires G-tetrad Formation—CpG-A is characterized by its ability to induce large amounts of IFN-α in PDC. However, the molecular basis for this feature of CpG-A is not well understood. In addition to CpG motifs that are present in both CpG-A and CpG-B, the sequence of CpG-A contains a palindrome in the center and poly(G) motifs at the 5′ and the 3′ end. We found that all three sequence motifs of CpG-A were required for its activity. Replacement of the CG dinucleotides to GC (CpG-A GC) completely abolished IFN-α induction in PDC (Fig. 1A). The exchange of only two bases of the palindrome motif (CpG-A mis, contains no palindrome) strongly reduced the activity of CpG-A (Fig. 1A). Replacement of the poly(G) motifs at both ends by poly(C) (CpG-A poly(C)) lead to complete loss of activity compared with CpG-A (Fig. 1A).Poly(G) motifs within the sequence of CpG-A may contribute to the IFN-α-inducing activity by different mechanisms including enhanced uptake, immune recognition or G-tetrad formation. G-tetrad formation can be blocked by 7-deazaguanosine substitution in the poly(G) motifs (27Benimetskaya L. Berton M. Kolbanovsky A. Benimetsky S. Stein C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2648-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 7-Deazaguanosine substitution of one base in each of the poly(G) motifs of CpG-A (CpG-A deaza) abrogated the IFN-α inducing activity of CpG-A (Fig. 1B), indicating that G-tetrad formation is required for the immunological activity of CpG-A.Structural Analysis of CpG-A Reveals Spontaneous Multimerization of CpG-A—G-tetrads consist of at least four contiguous poly(G) motifs linked via Hoogsteen base pairing. Because one CpG-A molecule contains two poly(G) motifs, G-tetrad formation requires at least two CpG-A molecules. To analyze the extent of G-tetrad formation by CpG-A, 32P-labeled ODN were analyzed on a 20% polyacrylamide gel. Under non-denaturing conditions, a high proportion of CpG-A showed a diffuse mobility pattern extending to the gel pocket indicating the formation of large and variable tertiary structures (Fig. 2A, second lane from the left). Heating of CpG-A up to 96 °C for 20 min followed by rapid cooling to 4 °C completely abolished the formation of tertiary structures of CpG-A (Fig. 2A, left lane); this condition also confirmed the position of the monomeric CpG-A on the gel. No tertiary structures were found for CpG-B or when the poly(G) motifs of CpG-A were replaced by poly(C) (Fig. 2A, third and fourth lanes from the left). Tertiary structures were largely diminished when the palindrome of CpG-A was destroyed by the exchange of two bases (CpG-A mis, Fig. 2A, second lane from the right). Tertiary structures were hardly detectable with a control ODN containing two poly(G) motifs at both ends but no palindrome (Tet 1.5 (28Marsh T.C. Henderson E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10718-10724Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); Fig. 2A, right lane). These results indicated that CpG-A but not CpG-B has a high tendency to spontaneously form large tertiary structures and that this structure formation depends on the presence of poly(G) motifs and on the palindrome and can be broken down to the monomeric molecules by exposure to very high temperatures.Fig. 2Structural analysis of CpG-A by using gel electrophoresis.32P-Labeled ODN were analyzed on a 20% polyacrylamide gel. A, non-denaturing gel analysis of CpG-A, CpG-A poly(C), CpG-A mis, CpG-B, Tet 1.5. For the results shown by the first lane CpG-A was boiled at 96 °C for 20 min and stored on ice before gel analysis. The gel was run at a constant electric field of 8 V/cm. Palindromes are indicated by boxes; mismatched bases in the palindrome are underscored. B, denaturing gel analysis of CpG-A and CpG-B. The marker ranges from 8–32 bp. The gel was run at a constant electric field of 40 V/cm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Under non-denaturing conditions the mobility of DNA on the gel is not linear to the size of the ODN. Denaturing gels disrupt Watson-Crick base pairing, thereby allowing a better estimate of the ODN length. Although large proportions of CpG-A were found to be monomeric under denaturing conditions (20 mer, Fig. 2B, left lane, indicated by 1), tertiary structures formed by CpG-A were still visible (Fig. 2B, left lane, indicated by 4 and 8). A dimer of CpG-A is expected in the area indicated by 2 (Fig. 2B, left lane). However, the first bands of higher intensity appear in higher molecular weight areas 4 and 8 (Fig. 2B, left lane) suggesting that the first stable tertiary structure is a quadruplex (4Hornung V. Rothenfusser S. Britsch S. Krug A. Jahrsdorfer B. Giese T. Endres S. Hartmann G. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4531-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar) rather than a duplex of CpG-A. Even under denaturing conditions, large tertiary structures up to the gel pocket were detected.It has been reported that the optimal salt conditions for G-tetrad formation is a mixture of sodium and potassium, usually Na+:K+ in a 10:1 to 20:1 ratio (29Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1990; 344: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). We compared spontaneous formation of tertiary structures by CpG-A under different salt concentrations (Fig. 3). CpG-A was first heated up to 96 °C and then rapidly cooled on ice and incubated at 37 °C or 60 °C for 24 h in the presence of buffers A, B, or C. Similar formation of tertiary structures by CpG-A was seen at 37 °C in all conditions tested (Fig. 3). However, tertiary structure formation was strongly reduced when CpG-A was incubated at 60 °C. These results indicated that spontaneous multimerization of CpG-A occurs at physiological conditions (37 °C) under both high sodium low potassium concentrations (typical for interstitial fluid) and low sodium high potassium concentrations (typical for the intracellular milieu).Fig. 3Temperature-dependent formation of higher order structures by CpG-A. Digoxigenin-labeled CpG-A diluted in water was heated at 95 °C for 2 min and then immediately put on ice and mixed with four different buffers (1:1 with 2-fold concentrated buffers): A, 4 mmol K+, 143 mmol Na+; B, 155 mmol K+, 10 mmol Na+; C, 10 mmol K+, 150 mmol Na+. Samples were incubated for 24 h at 37° or 60 °C as indicated before they were analyzed on a non-denaturing 16% polyacrylamide gel at room temperature (30 min at 100 V followed by 3 h at 200 V).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Visualization of Spontaneous CpG-A Nanoparticle Formation by Atomic Force Microscopy—The presence of a large proportion of CpG-A in the very high molecular weight area and the gel pocket of the gel suggested that CpG-A may form nanometer-sized multimers. We used high resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) for imaging of structures formed by CpG-A. This technique allows an exact measurement of the size and the visualization of the shape of single nanometer-sized particles formed under different conditions.For AFM imaging, CpG-A or CpG-B (6 μg/ml) were diluted in PBS (139 mmol Na+/4.2 mmol K+, without Ca2+ and Mg2+) and deposited on mica (solid support) pretreated with 25 mm Mg2+Cl. AFM imaging was performed in the dynamic mode in air. We found that CpG-A forms heterogenous particles mainly composed of globular and linear structures. The maximum size of globular structures was ∼50 nm; the length of linear structures exceeded 100 nm (Fig. 4). The height of structures was between 3 nm (longitudinal structures) and 10 nm (globular structures). For CpG-B no higher order structures were detectable (data not shown).Fig. 4Analysis of spontaneous nanoparticle formation by CpG-A by using atomic force microscopy. CpG-A (6 μg/ml) was diluted in PBS (4.2 mmol K+, 139 mmol Na+ without Ca2+ and Mg2+) and deposited on mica (solid support) pretreated with 25 mm Mg2+Cl- dried under vacuum.

Consequently, preformed nanoparticles coated with monomeric CpG-B (unable to form higher order structures by itself) may show similar immunological activity as CpG-A. To test this hypothesis, CpG-A, CpG-B, and CpG-B GC were adsorbed to the positively charged surface of polystyrene nanoparticles. The adsorption of CpG-B to polystyrene nanoparticles (CpG-B PS) resulted in a more than 300-fold increase in IFN-α induction in PDC compared with CpG-B alone (CpG-B PS, 49,097 pg/ml versus CpG-B, 146 pg/ml) (Fig. 5). IFN-α induction by polystyrene-bound CpG-B was even higher than with CpG-A. The ability of CpG-A to induce IFN-α was diminished by binding to polystyrene nanoparticles. No induction of IFN-α was found with the corresponding GC control of CpG-B with (CpG-B GC PS) and without (CpG-B GC) polystyrene nanoparticles confirming that IFN-α induction in PDC is CG-dependent and that polystyrene nanoparticles have no intrinsic IFN-α inducing activity (Fig. 5A). In contrast to IFN-α production, both CpG-A and CpG-B were found equally potent to induce TNF-α in PDC. The increase of TNF-α in PDC with polystyrene nanoparticles was much lower (3-fold, Fig. 5C) as compared with the increase in IFN-α (300-fold, Fig. 5B), suggesting that the induction of TNF-α was less dependent on the presentation of CpG motifs on particles.Fig. 5CpG-B-coated polystyrene nanoparticles mimic the immunological activity of CpG-A. Positively charged polystyrene nanoparticles (PS) were loaded with (negatively charged) CpG-B (CpG-B + PS), CpG-B GC (CpG-B GC + PS), or CpG-A (CpG-A + PS) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (A) or PDC (B and C) were incubated with ODN-loaded on PS or with ODN alone (final concentration of ODN with and without PS was 3 μg/ml). After 48 h supernatants were collected and IFN-α (A and B) or TNF-α (C) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

https://openalex.org/W1990356394,"The mammalian formin, mDia1, is an actin nucleation factor. Experiments in cells and in vitro show that the N-terminal region potently inhibits nucleation by the formin homology 2 (FH2) domain-containing C terminus and that RhoA binding to the N terminus partially relieves this inhibition. Cellular experiments suggest that potent inhibition depends upon the presence of the diaphanous auto-regulatory domain (DAD) C-terminal to FH2. In this study, we examine in detail the N-terminal and C-terminal regions required for this inhibition and for RhoA relief. Limited proteolysis of an N-terminal construct from residues 1–548 identifies two stable truncations: 129–548 and 129–369. Analytical ultracentrifugation suggests that 1–548 and 129–548 are dimers, whereas 129–369 is monomeric. All three N-terminal constructs inhibit nucleation by the full C terminus. Although inhibition by 1–548 is partially relieved by RhoA, inhibition by 129–548 or 129–369 is RhoA-resistant. At the C terminus, DAD deletion does not affect nucleation but decreases inhibitory potency of 1–548 by 20,000-fold. Synthetic DAD peptide binds both 1–548 and 129–548 with similar affinity and partially relieves nucleation inhibition. C-terminal constructs are stable dimers. Our conclusions are as follows: 1) DAD is an affinity-enhancing motif for auto-inhibition; 2) an N-terminal domain spanning residues 129–369 (called DID for diaphanous inhibitory domain) is sufficient for auto-inhibition; 3) a dimerization region C-terminal to DID increases the inhibitory ability of DID; and 4) DID alone is not sufficient for RhoA relief of auto-inhibition, suggesting that sequences N-terminal to DID are important to RhoA binding. An additional finding is that FH2 domain-containing constructs of mDia1 and mDia2 lose >75% nucleation activity upon freeze-thaw. The mammalian formin, mDia1, is an actin nucleation factor.

Cellular experiments and two-hybrid interactions implicate a short sequence C-terminal to FH2, known as the diaphanous auto-regulatory domain (DAD), as a critical binding site for the N terminus in both mDia1 and the related protein, mDia2 (16Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Direct effects of DAD on auto-inhibition of actin nucleation in vitro have not been examined. Cellular studies suggest that binding of the Rho family GTPase, RhoA, to the N terminus of mDia1 can relieve auto-inhibition (17Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies on actin nucleation support these findings (9Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), with the caveat that RhoA does not relieve completely the auto-inhibitory effect of the N terminus of mDia1. This incomplete relief by RhoA might imply that a second, non-RhoA dependent, auto-inhibitory interaction between the N and C terminus might exist. In this study, we examine mDia1 auto-inhibition in more detail. Deletion experiments show that auto-inhibition can be uncoupled from RhoA relief, suggesting that mDia1's N-terminal binding sites for RhoA and for the mDia1 C terminus are not identical. In addition, deletion of DAD from the C terminus does not affect nucleation but decreases the inhibitory potency of the N terminus 20,000-fold, suggesting that DAD mediates a high affinity interaction important for potent auto-inhibition. A synthetic DAD peptide binds the N terminus and partially disrupts auto-inhibition, supporting the role of DAD. DNA Constructs—Constructs of mouse mDia1 (accession number U96963) were generated by reverse transcription-PCR and cloned into pGEX-KT, as described previously (9Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Deletion constructs were generated by PCR from longer constructs, using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The mouse mDia2 521–1171 construct in pGEX-KT was a kind gift from Dr. Arthur Alberts (Van Andel Research Institute). Protein Preparation and Purification—All proteins were expressed and purified through the thrombin cleavage step following the procedure described in detail in Refs. 9Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar and 10Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20076-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar. After elution of thrombin-cleaved protein from glutathione-Sepharose, further purification varied as follows. N-terminal constructs (1–548, 129–548, and 129–369) were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on a SourceS15 5/5 or 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and then concentrated on Q Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) and dialyzed into the following buffer: 2 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT. N-terminal constructs could be frozen in aliquots of <50 μl in liquid nitrogen and subsequently stored at -70 °C with no loss of inhibitory activity or detectable aggregation. C-terminal constructs (748–1255, 748–1203, 748–1175, and mDia2-(521–1171)) were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on a SourceQ15 5/5 or 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences), concentrated on SP Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences), and dialyzed into the following buffer: 2 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT. C-terminal constructs lost >75% of their nucleation activity when frozen. C-terminal constructs were stored at concentrations <10 μm at 4 °C for 2 weeks or with 1 volume of glycerol at -20 °C for two months with no loss of activity. Protein concentrations were determined by two methods: from absorbance at 280 nm (extinction coefficient calculated by protein sequence using us.expasy.org/cgi-bin/protparam) and by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE using known amounts of actin as standards. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified from acetone powder (18Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled with pyrenyl iodoacetamide (19Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Both unlabeled and labeled actin were gel-filtered on S200 (20MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Cell. 1980; 20: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), which was crucial to obtain reproducible polymerization kinetics. DAD Peptide Synthesis, Fluorescent Labeling, and Fluorescence Anisotropy—A peptide containing amino acids 1177–1200 of mouse mDia1 (DETGVMDSLLEALQSGAAFRRKRG) was synthesized by the W. M. Keck Small Peptide Synthesis Facility at Yale University, with the following modifications: N-terminal acetylation; N-terminal cysteine residue; C-terminal amidation. The crude peptide was dissolved in water to 14 mg/ml in 100 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0. Peptide was labeled with fluorescein-5′-maleimide (FITC-maleimide, Molecular Probes F150) by mixing 1.4 mg/ml peptide with 1 mm FITC-maleimide at 20 °C for 1 h. FITC-peptide was separated from unincorporated FITC-maleimide by Sephadex G-10 gel filtration (Amersham Biosciences) in 2 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl and then dialyzed for 48 h in two 4-liter changes of the same buffer, using SnakeSkin 3,500 molecular weight cut-off tubing (Pierce). Electrospray mass spectrometry (Dartmouth Proteomics Core Facility) of the purified peptide revealed a single peak at 3179 daltons, the expected mass of FITC-DAD, and no lower mass peak was observed (consistent with apparent complete labeling and unincorporated FITC-maleimide removal). FITC-DAD concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient supplied by Molecular Probes (83,000 m-1 cm-1 at 492 nm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0). Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were taken in an PC1 spectrofluorimeter (ISS Inc., Champaign IL), using 10 nm FITC-DAD in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT. Limited Proteolysis of mDia1 N Terminus—The 1–548 fragment (100 μm, 6 mg/ml) was digested with 300 nm chymotrypsin (Sigma C6423), trypsin (Sigma T8658), or proteinase K (Sigma P2308) in 10 mm Tris-Hcl (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT for up to 1 h at 4 °C (chymotrypsin or trypsin) or at 20 °C (proteinase K). Digestion was terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/diisopropyl fluorophosphate (Calbiochem) to 1 mm each (from 50 mm stock of each in ethanol) and incubation on ice for 15 min. Upon restoration of eyesight, residual inhibitor was inactivated by the addition of dithiothreitol (Calbiochem) to 10 mm from a 1 m stock in water (freshly made) and further incubation for 15 min on ice. The major proteolytic fragment from each digestion was isolated by fast protein liquid chromatography on a SourceQ15 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) and then dialyzed in the same buffer used for mDia1 1–548 storage (described above), frozen in <50-ml aliquots in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. Masses of proteolytic products were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization spectroscopy, and N-terminal sequences were determined by Edman degradation, both carried out in the Dartmouth Proteomics Core Facility. Protein Size Analysis Techniques—Gel filtration chromatography was conducted using a Superdex 200 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) calibrated with both high and low molecular weight standards. Elution volumes (in ml) of standards were: void, 8.8; included, 21.7; thyroglobulin, 9.2; ferritin, 10.3; catalase, 12.2; aldolase, 13.7; albumin, 14.1; ovalbumin, 15.4; chymotrypsinogen, 17.7; and RNase A, 18.1. Stokes radii were calculated following the manufacturer's instructions. Gel filtration was conducted in sizing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm DTT). Analytical ultracentrifugation was conducted using a Beckman Proteomelab XL-A and an AN-60 rotor. In all ultracentrifugation analysis, the proteins used were the peak fraction from the above gel filtration, and thus were used in the sizing buffer. For velocity analytical ultracentrifugation, protein was centrifuged at 35,000 rpm and 20 °C, and UV absorbance was monitored every 2 min by continuous scan at 0.003-cm steps. For most experiments, protein was detected at 220 nm, with a starting absorbance of 0.5 absorbance units. For N-terminal fragments, this absorbance was equivalent to 1.25, 1.45, and 2 μm for mDia1 1–548, 129–548, and 129–369, respectively. For mDia1 C-terminal fragments, this absorbance was equivalent to ∼1.4 μm in all cases (mDia1 748–1255, 748–1203, and 748–1175) and to 1.2 μm for mDia2 521–1171. For mDia1 129–548 at higher concentrations, absorbance at 280 nm was used, with a starting concentration of 0.5 absorbance units (32 μm). Protein partial specific volume, buffer density, and buffer viscosity were determined using Sednterp. 2Program by D. Hayes and T. Laue. Scans 1–200 were analyzed using Sedfit87. For equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation, multiple concentrations of protein, in sizing buffer, were centrifuged at 7000, 10,000, and 14,000 rpm for 20, 15, and 15 h, respectively. Three protein concentrations were used: the concentrations indicated above and two 2-fold serial dilutions of these concentrations. Scans at 220 or 280 nm and 0.001-cm steps were recorded every hour. Winmatch software 3Program by D. Yphantis. was used to confirm equilibrium, and Winreedit software 3Program by D. Yphantis. was used to trim the data. Winnonln software 3Program by D. Yphantis. was used to fit the data. First, individual concentrations at individual speeds were analyzed for speed- and concentration-dependent systematic variation. Next, data at multiple concentrations and speeds were fit to a single species model. If the systematic residual error pattern of this fit suggested non-ideality (21.McRorie, D. K., and Voelker, P. J. Self-associating Systems in the Analytical Ultracentrifuge, pp. 1-51, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CAGoogle Scholar), the data from all speeds and concentrations were fit to a dissociating dimerization model, using a fixed σ corresponding to the monomer mass (determined by Sednterp). 2Program by D. Hayes and T. Laue. Protein masses were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. Actin Polymerization by Fluorescence Spectroscopy—A detailed procedure is described in Ref. 22Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32531-32534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar. Unlabeled and pyrene-labeled actin were mixed in G buffer (2 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% NaN3) to produce an actin stock of the desired pyrene-labeled actin percentage (5% unless otherwise stated). This stock was converted to Mg2+ salt by a 2-min incubation at 23 °C in 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2 immediately prior to polymerization. Polymerization was induced by the addition of 10× KMEI (500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 100 mm imidazole, pH 7) to a concentration of 1×, with the remaining volume made up by G buffer. Added proteins were mixed together for 1 min prior to their rapid addition to actin to start the assay. Pyrene fluorescence (excitation 365 nm, emission 407 nm) was monitored in a PC1 spectrofluorimeter (ISS Inc.) or an LS50B spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The time between the mixing of final components and start of fluorimeter data collection was measured for each assay and ranged between 10 and 25 s. Calculating Filament Concentration—Slopes of pyrene fluorescence from polymerization time courses were determined at the 50% point of polymerization with Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Slopes were converted to filament concentration under the assumption of unrestricted ATP-actin monomer addition to barbed ends (shown in Ref. 10Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20076-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) with a rate constant (K+) of 11.6 μm-1 s-1 (23Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) according to the following equation: F = S′/(M0.5 × K+), where F is filament concentration in μm, S′ is the slope converted to μm/s, and M0.5 is μm monomer concentration at 50% polymerization. S′ is calculated by the equation S′ = (S × Mt)/(fmax - fmin), where S is raw slope in arbitrary units/s, Mt is μm concentration of total polymerizable monomer in μm, and fmax and fmin are fluorescence of fully polymerized and unpolymerized actin respectively, in arbitrary units. Physical Properties of mDia1 N-terminal Constructs—We have shown previously that an N-terminal fragment of mDia1 (residues 1–548, Fig. 1A) potently inhibits actin nucleation by FH2 domain-containing C-terminal constructs (9Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In this study, we further dissected the N terminus. First, we characterized two proteolytically derived deletions of 1–548: a chymotrypsin-generated fragment from residues 120–548 and a proteinase K-generated fragment from residues 129–369 (Fig. 1A). For proteinase K, digestion at 20 °C for up to 60 min resulted in no additional cleavage products (not shown). Given the promiscuous nature of proteinase K (24Morihara K. Tsuzuki H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1975; 39: 1489Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 25Broemme D. Peters K. Fink S. Fittkau S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 439Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), resistance to digestion under these conditions suggests that the region from 129 to 369 is very stably folded. For chymotrypsin, digestion at 4 °C for 1 h produced the 120–548 fragment, whereas digestion at 20 °C produced an additional product with similar SDS-PAGE mobility to that of the proteinase K-derived fragment (not shown). Trypsin digestion produced similar results to those with chymotrypsin (not shown). Upon determining the N- and C-terminal residues of these proteolytic fragments, we produced analogous bacterial expression constructs, with the only modification being that the chymotrypsin fragment-like construct started at residue 129 instead of 120. The bulk of our subsequent characterization was carried out using these bacterially expressed fragments. However, proteolytically generated proteins mimicked their bacterially expressed counterparts in all properties tested below. All protein preparations appeared homogenous by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). Before testing the effects of these N-terminal deletions on actin, we characterized their native molecular sizes. Similar to our previous study (9Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), 1–548 eluted with apparent Stokes radius of 65.7 Å by gel filtration chromatography, whereas 129–548 and 129–369 eluted at 58.1 and 28.4 Å, respectively (Fig. 2A). Assuming that each protein is spherical, these Stokes radii suggest molecular masses of 380, 241, and 40.3 kDa for 1–548, 129–548, and 129–369, respectively. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation of the peak gel filtration fractions, at concentrations between 1 and 2 μm, resulted in predominant sedimenting species of 4.6, 4.1, and 2.4 s for 1–548, 129–548, and 129–369, respectively (Fig. 2B, Table I). However, both 1–548 and 129–548 contained second sedimenting species at lower s values. Since the samples had been gel-filtered immediately prior to velocity centrifugation, the secondary peaks may suggest a reversible dissociation.Table ISize determination of protein constructs used in this studyConstructMass, calculatedMass, MALDIMass, solutionSedimentation coefficientFrictional coefficientSignals%1-54862.863.0100.3aEquilibrium centrifugation suggests monomer-dimer equilibrium.

All other constructs tested were from mDia1 Open table in a new tab Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation at multiple protein concentrations (between 0.3 and 2 μm) and multiple speeds suggested that 129–369 was monomeric. In contrast, 129–549 and 1–548 fit best to monomer-dimer equilibria, with apparent dissociation constants of 328 and 46 nm, respectively (Fig. 2C and Table I). For 1–548 and 129–548, the large discrepancy between molecular mass estimates from equilibrium ultracentrifugation and gel filtration, as well as the large frictional ratios calculated for velocity ultracentrifugation (Table I), suggest that these proteins are elongated rather than spherical. When equilibrium experiments were conducted at 20-fold higher concentrations (32 μm maximum concentration), 129–548 exhibited properties indistinguishable from those of a dimer (Table I and Fig. 2D). These results suggest that the region between residues 370 and 548 confer dimerization potential, with dimerization equilibrium constants in the range of 100 nm. Effects of N-terminal Deletions on Actin Nucleation—We characterized the effects of 1–548, 129–548, and 129–369 on actin polymerization kinetics using the pyrene-actin polymerization assay in the absence or presence of 2.5 nm mDia1 748–1203 (Fig. 1A). This construct contains the FH2 domain and DAD and is a potent nucleator (Fig. 3). None of the N-terminal constructs alone affected actin polymerization kinetics at concentrations up to 20 μm ((9Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and not shown). In contrast, all N-terminal constructs inhibited nucleation by 748–1203 (Fig. 3, A–C). The IC50 values for each construct were ∼2 nm for 1–548, 20 nm for 129–548, and 200 nm for 129–369 (Fig. 3D). When 748–1255 was used as the nucleation factor, results were indistinguishable from those using 748–1203 (not shown). We then tested the ability of RhoA to relieve inhibition by the N-terminal constructs. In contrast to 1–548, the inhibition of which is partially relieved by RhoA (9Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), the inhibitory activities of 129–548 and 129–369 are unaffected by high concentrations of RhoA (Fig. 4 and not shown). The result was identical with either GDP or GMP-PNP-bound RhoA. Importance of DAD to Auto-inhibition—From the data in Fig. 3, a construct containing the FH2 domain and DAD (748–1203) behaves similarly to a construct containing the entire C terminus (748–1255 (9Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar)) in that it is a potent nucleator and its nucleation ability is inhibited by N-terminal constructs. To determine the role of DAD in auto-inhibition, we expressed a shorter construct in which DAD was truncated (748–1175, Fig. 1A). This construct was equally potent to 748–1255 and 748–1203 in actin nucleation (Fig. 5A). We next compared the ability of 748–1175 to be inhibited by 1–548. Measurable inhibition required 1–548 concentrations >10 μm (Fig. 5B), but complete inhibition was never attained at the concentrations tested (Fig. 5C). The estimated IC50 of 1–548 for 748–1175 is 40 μm. To test directly an interaction between DAD and the N terminus, we synthesized a fluorescein-coupled 25-residue peptide containing the DAD sequence (FITC-DAD). By fluorescence anisotropy (26Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), FITC-DAD binds both 1–548 and 129–548 (Fig. 6A), with a Kdapp of 0.25 μm. The anisotropy change produced by 129–369 was too small to determine affinity with accuracy, but the presence of 129–369 consistently raised the anisotropy of FITC-DAD, suggesting that it bound as well. FITC-DAD was sufficient to disrupt the auto-inhibitory interaction between 748–1255 and 1–548 (Fig. 6B). Similar to RhoA relief of auto-inhibition, FITC-DAD was unable to cause full recovery of 748–1255 activity (Fig. 6C). Effect of Freezing on mDia1 Nucleation Activity—Several laboratories have published work in which nucleation by mDia1 FH2 domain-containing constructs is examined (7Moseley J.B. Sagot I. Manning A.L. Xu Y. Eck M.J. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 896-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 9Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr.

Cell. 2004; 119: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and the nucleation potency of mDia1 varies widely among these studies. Since this variability could influence mechanistic interpretations, we sought to determine factors that might cause these activity changes. We found that “flash” freezing resulted in the loss of >75% nucleation potency for mDia1 748–1203 and mDia2 521–1171 (containing FH1, FH2, DAD, and C-terminal sequences), as well as for mDia1 748–1255 and 748–1175 (Fig. 7 and not shown). Samples were frozen in 10-μl aliquots in thin-walled PCR tubes by plunging into liquid nitrogen, conditions in which the sample was frozen in <2 s. This loss of activity occurred regardless of the presence of 50% glycerol. In contrast, similar freezing of mDia1 N-terminal constructs did not affect their abilities to inhibit nucleation (not shown). In this study, we characterize the auto-inhibitory properties of mDia1 biochemically, with the following results. First, our work extends previous cellular findings of DAD function (16Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), suggesting that the role of DAD is to increase binding affinity to the N-terminal auto-inhibitory domains rather than to be part of the auto-inhibitory mechanism. Second, we identify a core inhibitory region, comprising residues 129–369, which we refer to as DID (diaphanous inhibitory domain). Third, we show that auto-inhibition can be uncoupled from RhoA relief of auto-inhibition since inhibition by the minimal DID or DID with a C-terminal extension is not relievable by RhoA. Fourth, we identify a region between DID and the FH1 domain that mediates dimerization. We identify DID by limited proteolysis using proteinase K. The exceptional resistance of residues 129–369 to proteinase K suggests that this region adopts a stable tertiary structure. In addition, the ability of this region to inhibit nucleation by the mDia1 C terminus suggests that it mediates the major auto-inhibitory interaction. We predict that this region contains the DAD-interacting region. Sequence alignments demonstrate that many formins, including members of the metazoan DAAM and FRL groups, as well as budding yeast Bni1p, contain regions similar to DID (15Higgs H.N. Peterson K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 16: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). All of these proteins also possess putative DADs. Thus, auto-inhibitory regulation through DID/DAD binding may be common to many formins. Notable exceptions are proteins in the delphilin, FMN, and INF metazoan groups (15Higgs H.N. Peterson K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 16: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), which we predict to be regulated by different mechanisms. In contrast, since neither this region nor the 129–548 construct appears to interact productively with RhoA, motifs important for RhoA binding must lie N-terminal to residue 129. Previous two-hybrid studies found that RhoA bound an mDia1 construct containing residues 63–260 (29Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Possibly, full affinity for RhoA requires residues both within DID and N-terminal to DID. Inclusion of residues from 369 to 548 causes N-terminal fragments to dimerize with affinity in the 100 nm range. Since a coiled-coil region is strongly predicted from 470 to 550 (15Higgs H.N. Peterson K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 16: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that this coiled-coil region mediates dimerization, raising at least two questions. First, does this region dimerize in a parallel or antiparallel orientation? Second, what is the multimeric state of full-length mDia1, which contains both this dimerization region and the dimeric FH2 domain? Answers to these questions will be necessary for a complete understanding of mDia1 regulation. Our experiments clearly show that DAD is required for high affinity auto-inhibition. Deletion of DAD from the C terminus raises the IC50 of the N-terminal 1–548 construct from 2 nm to 40 μm, or 20,000-fold. Synthetic DAD peptide binds DID-containing constructs and partially relieves inhibition. Mutations that disrupt DAD function in cells also disrupt DAD function in our biochemical assays. 4F. Li, H. N. Higgs, and A. Alberts, unpublished results. Since DAD is not required for nucleation, and inhibition of the DAD-less C terminus can be affected at high concentrations of N terminus, we hypothesize that the role of DAD is to supply a high affinity interaction that enables a second interaction between DID and the FH2 domain. This second interaction is inhibitory to nucleation. The fact that RhoA does not fully relieve auto-inhibition suggests that a second activator is required for full activation. This activator may disrupt the non-DAD-mediated interaction or further destabilize the DID/DAD interaction. The nucleation activity of mDia1 and mDia2 FH2 domain-containing constructs is strongly diminished by freezing. This fact might contribute to varying mDia1 nucleation potencies observed by different laboratories (7Moseley J.B. Sagot I. Manning A.L. Xu Y. Eck M.J. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Mol. Biol.

The sensitivity to freezing might imply that FH2 domain-containing constructs are sensitive to other storage conditions as well. We observe that mDia1 FH2 domain-containing constructs partially precipitate in a variety of buffer conditions when stored at high concentrations (>10 μm) at 4 °C for extended periods (>3 days). For these reasons, we store mDia1 <10 μm at 4 °C, in which case full activity is maintained for ∼2 weeks. For longer storage, the addition of glycerol to 50% v/v and storage at -20 °C maintains full activity for several months. This sensitivity to freezing might not be universal for FH2 domains since freezing FH2 domain-containing constructs of FRL1 (10Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol.

The terminal laminin-like globular (LG3) domain of endorepellin appears to possess most of the biological activity on endothelial cells. LG3 protein has been detected in the urine of patients with end-stage renal disease and in the amniotic fluid of pregnant women with premature rupture of fetal membranes. These findings suggest that proteolytic processing of endorepellin and the generation of LG3 might have biological significance. In this study, we have identified specific enzymes of the bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1)/Tolloid family of metalloproteases that cleave LG3 from recombinant endorepellin at the physiologically relevant site and that cleave LG3 from endogenous perlecan in cultured mouse and human cells. The BMP-1/Tolloid family of metalloproteases is thereby implicated in the processing of a major basement membrane proteoglycan and in the liberation of an anti-angiogenic factor. Using molecular modeling, site-directed mutagenesis and angiogenic assays, we further demonstrate that LG3 activity requires specific amino acids involved in Ca2+ coordination.

Perlecan is a proteoglycan widely expressed during early stages of development, in most vascularized tissues, and in the avascular cartilage (1Murdoch A.D. Liu B. Schwarting R. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V.

The unique modular structure of perlecan allows it to interact with other basement membrane components and various growth factors during vasculogenesis (1Murdoch A.D. Liu B. Schwarting R. Tuan R.S.

Genetic evidence of roles for perlecan in vasculogenesis derives from the complex phenotype of perlecan null mice, most of which perish at day 10.5 of embryogenesis due to increased blood vessel pressure (7Arikawa-Hirasawa E.

The perlecan protein core is a large, modular protein of ∼470 kDa composed of five structural domains (10Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). The 85-kDa C-terminal domain V, renamed endorepellin in light of its recently discovered angiostatic activity (11Mongiat M. Sweeney S. San Antonio J.D. Fu J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol.

The structure of endorepellin is organized in a pattern akin to the LG 1The abbreviations used are: LG, laminin-like globular; BMP-1, bone morphogenetic protein-1; mTLD, mammalian Tolloid; mTLL-1 and mTLL-2, mammalian Tolloid-like-1 and -2; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; Ad-ER, adenovirus-endorepellin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EBNA, Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen. domain repeats of agrin and laminin, i.e. a sequential series of LG domains, which, in the case of endorepellin, are interconnected by short epidermal growth factor-like repeats (12Hohenester E. Engel J. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Indeed, endorepellin displays binding affinities similar to those reported for agrin and various laminins (13Brown J.C. Sasaki T. Go ̈hring W. Yamada E. Timpl R. Eur. J.

These findings suggest that proteolytic processing of endorepellin and the generation of LG3 might have biological significance. In this study, we demonstrate that enzymes of the bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1)/Tolloid-like family of metalloproteases specifically liberate LG3 by cleaving endorepellin between Asn4196 and Asp4197, the same site at which cleavage produces LG3 in vivo. Moreover, such proteinases also directly liberate LG3 from endogenous perlecan in cultured mouse and human cells. Mutation of Asp4197 prevents processing of endorepellin, further confirming the specificity of this cleavage site. To better understand the molecular determinants of LG3 biological activity, we have generated a three-dimensional model and performed site-directed mutagenesis of key amino acid residues involved in Ca2+ coordination. Manipulation of this site reduced the ability to bind Ca2+ and abrogated LG3 activity on endothelial cells. Proteolytic Processing by BMP-1/Tolloid-like Proteinases—For in vitro cleavage assays, purified recombinant endorepellin/domain V (11Mongiat M. Sweeney S. San Antonio J.D. Fu J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol.

Cleavage assays involved overnight incubation of ∼0.6 pmol endorepellin with ∼0.3 pmol of protease at 37 °C (18Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L.

N-terminal sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation at the Harvard University Microchemistry Facility. Preparation of adenovirus-endorepellin (Ad-ER) and transduction experiments were performed as described previously (15Bix G. Fu J. Gonzalez E. Macro L. Barker A. Campbell S. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A.

Comparative Modeling of Endorepellin LG3 and Mutant Design— The LG3 domain was aligned to the sequence of the murine laminin α2LG5 domain (24Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank number 1dyk) using Biology Workbench and afterward improved manually by moving insertions and deletions with the aid of a multiple sequence alignment of LG modules performed by Timpl et al. (25Timpl R. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Andac Z. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The alignments took into account secondary structural elements of α2LG5 crystal structure (26Hohenester E. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), as well as the PROSITE entry for the laminin G domain (PS50025), which contains over 80 sequences of LG domains in multiple alignment format. The LG3-α2LG5 alignment was submitted to the SWISS-MODEL modeling server (27Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). The model structure was assessed for quality with ANOLEA (28Melo F. Feytmans E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and the Swiss-PDB Viewer (27Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). Placement and refinement of the calcium ion and subsequent mutations were performed using the Swiss-PDB Viewer. All structures were analyzed using the Swiss-PDB Viewer and Chimera (29Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (29000) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins and Mutant Species—We cloned either the full-length endorepellin or its terminal LG3 module (G4182-S4391) into the pCEP-Pu vector containing the BM-40 signal peptide sequence and a C-terminal His6 tag. This vector was used as a template to introduce Ile or Ala point mutations with the QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All the mutant constructs were sequenced and stably transfected into human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cells. Transfectants were selected in medium containing G418 (250 μg ml-1) and puromycin (500 ng ml-1) for at least 4 weeks. Isolation and purification of recombinant proteins were as described previously (11Mongiat M. Sweeney S. San Antonio J.D. Fu J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4238-4249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Protein purity was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining, and identity and size were verified by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using either anti-endorepellin or anti-His tag antibodies. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy and 45Ca2+Overlay Assays—CD spectra were recorded at 22 °C using a JASCO J-500C spectropolarimeter. The path length of the CD cells was 0.1 mm, and CD was expressed in terms of ellipticity [θ] in degree·cm2·dmol-1. Samples were dialyzed into PBS, and various concentrations (0.5–1 mg ml-1) were analyzed. At least four scans were performed for each spectrum. The ability of the recombinant LG3 and its mutants to coordinate Ca2+ was tested by 45Ca2+ overlay assay (30Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Different protein concentrations were slot-blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were washed in PBS at different pHs (7.4, 6.5, and 5.5). To remove any possible Ca2+ contaminants, the buffers were pre-eluted through a Chelex® (Bio-Rad) column. The membranes were incubated in the same buffer containing 1 mCi of 45Ca2+ (13 mCi mg-1 Ca, MP Biomedicals) for 1 h at 25 °C, washed with the same buffer for 5 min, and then washed again with 50% ethanol (v/v) for another 5 min. Following drying, the membranes were exposed to x-ray films for 18–24 h. Images were processed with Adobe PhotoShop 7.0 and analyzed using NIH Image 1.59 software. Effects of LG3 Mutations on Endothelial Cell Actin Cytoskeleton and Capillary Morphogenesis—HUVECs (passages 4–8) were cultured on collagen-coated chamber slides (Nalge Nunc) in complete medium (11Mongiat M. Sweeney S. San Antonio J.D. Fu J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4238-4249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). After serum starving, the cells were treated, in a blinded fashion, with 50 nm LG3, mutants D4258A, N4327A, the double mutant D4258A/N4327A, or PBS for 10 min. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min, and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (to visualize actin stress fibers) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Images were captured with an Olympus DP12 microscope and a SPOT CCD camera and processed with Adobe PhotoShop 7.0. Actin stress fibers were assessed from 100 randomly selected cells in a blinded fashion. For capillary morphogenesis, 4 × 104 HUVECs cells were plated in four-well chamber slides precoated with Matrigel and incubated with 50 nm recombinant proteins in M199 medium (1% serum) for 24 h at 37 °C. The wells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Images were captured as above and analyzed using NIH Image 1.59 software. Statistical analysis was performed with the Student's paired t test using the SigmaPlot 2001 software package. p value ≤0.01 was accepted as significant. BMP-1/Tolloid-like Metalloproteases Process Endorepellin— Purification of recombinant endorepellin (∼85 kDa) from 293-EBNA cells often showed a second band of ∼26 kDa when purified protein was separated on reducing acrylamide gels (11Mongiat M. Sweeney S. San Antonio J.D. Fu J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4238-4249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Because this product was formed during purification procedures, we speculated that it could be a natural cleavage product of endorepellin produced by endogenous proteases. Amino acid sequencing of the N terminus of the 26-kDa product showed that it resulted from cleavage immediately before the third LG domain of endorepellin, between Asn4196 and Asp4197. The sequence surrounding this putative natural cleavage site (SGGN↓DAPGQY) was searched against the MEROPS data base (merops.sanger.ac.uk) (31Rawlings N.D. Tolle D.P. Barrett A.J. Nuc. Acids Res. 2004; 32: D160-D164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for specific proteases that could cleave this bond. Only two proteases (out of >1800 known protease sequences in the MEROPS data base) were found with the required specificity; the two related metalloproteases, BMP-1 (Merops identifier M12.005) and mTLL-1 (Merops identifier M12.016). To determine whether BMP-1/Tolloid-like proteases were capable of cleaving the LG3 domain from precursors, BMP-1 was incubated with recombinant endorepellin. As mentioned above, recombinant endorepellin contained small quantities of the 26-kDa LG3 that, due to a C-terminal His tag (11Mongiat M. Sweeney S. San Antonio J.D. Fu J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4238-4249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 15Bix G. Fu J. Gonzalez E. Macro L. Barker A. Campbell S. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Kim J.K. Ho ̈o ̈k M. Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), co-purified with full-length endorepellin (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Although the purified endorepellin was stable when incubated alone at 37 °C for 18 h (Fig. 1A, lane 2), incubation with BMP-1 resulted in cleavage to produce an ∼60-kDa fragment, representing the N-terminal portion of the molecule (which includes LG1–LG2 and the four epidermal growth factor repeats) and additional quantities of free 26-kDa LG3 domain (Fig. 1A, lane 3). In agreement with these findings, we found that the 60-kDa fragment reacted with an anti-endorepellin antibody, but it was not recognized by an antibody directed against the C-terminal His tag, which should had been lost following cleavage (not shown). Moreover, N-terminal sequencing of the 26-kDa band cleaved by BMP-1 gave the single sequence 4197DAPGQYGAYFHD4208. This sequence is identical to that of free LG3 domain produced by transfected 293-EBNA cells and identical to the sequence of the free LG3 domain found in the urine of patients with end-stage renal disease (16Oda O. Shinzato T. Ohbayashi K. Takai I. Kunimatsu M. Maeda K. Yamanaka N. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1996; 255: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Each of the four mammalian BMP-1/Tolloid-like proteases was incubated with endorepellin to determine which might be capable of cleavage to produce free LG3. BMP-1 showed the highest levels of endorepellin-processing activity, with lesser levels shown by mTLL-1 and mTLD (Fig. 1B). The lowest levels of processing were observed for mTLL-2. In fact, reactions with mTLL-2 required exposures of blots longer than that shown in Fig. 1 for detection of the 60-kDa band (not shown). To determine whether BMP-1/Tolloid-like proteinases might be responsible for the proteolytic processing of perlecan in live cells, we examined conditioned medium of MEFs derived from either wild type or mutant embryos doubly null for the Bmp1 gene, which encodes alternatively spliced mRNAs for BMP-1 and mTLD, and the Tll1 gene, which encodes mTLL-1. A 26-kDa protein species was readily detectable with anti-endorepellin antibody in the medium of wild type MEFs (Fig. 1C), consistent with the probability that free LG3 is a natural cleavage product produced by endogenous proteinases. In contrast, the 26-kDa form was absent from the medium of Bmp1/Tll1 doubly null MEFs, providing genetic evidence that product(s) of one or both of these two genes are responsible for the proteolytic processing that produces free LG3 in vivo. There was an absence of detectable 85-kDa endorepellin in media conditioned by either wild type or doubly homozygous null MEFs (Fig. 1C). When WiDr colon carcinoma cells were transduced with Ad-ER, we detected both endorepellin and LG3 (Fig. 1D). We could also detect comparable levels of the 26-kDa LG3 in media conditioned by cells that were either untreated or transduced with an empty adenovirus (Fig. 1D). Media conditioned by HUVECs also contained LG3 (not shown). These combined data strongly suggest that LG3 is cleaved directly from perlecan and that endorepellin need not be a processing intermediate (at least in cultured cells). Importantly, none of the cell layers examined (total cell lysates) contained detectable levels of either endorepellin or LG3, indicating that the cleavage is extracellular and serves to release soluble LG3 from basement membranes or the cell surface. Mutation of Asp4197 Prevents Cleavage of Endorepellin by BMP-1—The sequence of the cleavage site (SGGN↓DAPGQY) is highly conserved between the human and mouse endorepellin, and it has been previously shown that Asp but not Asn is crucial for proteolytic processing of murine perlecan domain V/endorepellin (14Friedrich M.V.K. Go ̈hring W. Mo ̈rgelin M. Brancaccio A. David G. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To test this, we mutated Asp4197 into Ile (D4197I) and tested the recombinant protein for biological activity in HUVECs. Both the wild type and mutant species disrupted the actin cytoskeleton at equimolar amounts (200 nm for 10 min) (Fig. 2A), indicating that mutation of this residue did not significantly disrupt its activity. Next, we transiently transfected 293-EBNA cells with either wild type or D4197I mutant cDNAs. The 48-h conditioned media showed the presence of LG3 in the wild type, likely produced by endogenous BMP-1/Tolloid-like proteinases, but not in the mutant species (Fig. 2B). Consistent with these findings, recombinant BMP-1 was not capable of releasing LG3 from D4197I endorepellin under the same experimental conditions in which it was fully active with the wild type endorepellin (Fig. 2C). Thus, we conclude that Asp4197 is essential for BMP-1 processing of human endorepellin. Three-dimensional Molecular Model of Endorepellin LG3 Module and Mutational Analysis—LG3 domain was aligned with the murine laminin α2LG5 domain (extracted from Protein Data Bank number 1dyk) (24Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The alignment showed 24% identity (Fig. 3A), typical of homology among LG domains (25Timpl R. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Andac Z. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Although LG modules possess only modest sequence identity, they are predicted to be well conserved structurally and display certain conserved sequence elements, in particular a conserved pair of Cys residues and a core of hydrophobic residues that correspond to β-strands of α2LG5 (25Timpl R. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Andac Z. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of the tandem laminin α2LG4–LG5 domains (24Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrates the predicted conservation of structure. Indeed, laminin α2LG4 and LG5, despite possessing only 24% sequence identity (much like LG3-α2LG5 alignment), superimpose structurally with a Cα root mean square deviation of only 1.1 Å, using 139 of 181 Cαs for the superposition. This pattern of low overall sequence identity but conserved structure is evidenced in structural comparisons of other LG domain-containing proteins. For instance, Protein Data Bank number 1h30 and Protein Data Bank number 1kdm possess sequence identities similar to the LG3/1dyk alignment yet superimpose with each other with only 1.08 Å root mean square deviation over a combined total of 540 Cαs used for analysis. The predicted structural similarity among LG modules combined with sequence alignments and known crystal structures of prototypical LG domains (24Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hohenester E. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) allowed us to construct a comparative model of the endorepellin LG3 domain based on the α2LG5 structure. The comparative model (Fig. 3B) consists of a β-sandwich or jellyroll composed of 14 antiparallel β strands arranged in two sheets (24Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hohenester E. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Areas of predicted secondary structure in our LG3 model (Fig. 3A, arrows) are also areas of high identity/homology between the LG3 model and the α2LG5 template structure. Additionally, Cys residues of LG3 were found to fit into the overall fold favorably and are predicted to form a disulfide bond in the LG3. Functional conservation of Ca2+-coordinating residues in the D-E and J-K loops (Fig. 3A, red triangles) indicates that Ca2+ can coordinate in this region and is likely necessary for receptor interactions, much like in other LG modules (32Wizemann H. Garbe J.H. Friedrich M.V. Timpl R. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Electrostatic analysis of the model surface showed that LG3 is quite negatively charged (pI = 5.03, see below) (Fig. 3C). This provides a molecular explanation for the lack of LG3 affinity to heparin and for the lack of requirement for cell surface heparan sulfate for full biological activity (15Bix G. Fu J. Gonzalez E. Macro L. Barker A. Campbell S. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Kim J.K. Ho ̈o ̈k M. Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Moreover, electrostatic analysis indicated that the predicted Ca2+-coordinating region forms an acidic pocket on the surface, despite variations in nearby loop regions. Such variations include an extended LG3 D-E loop and the presence of Asn4327 which, like the Asp found in a corresponding position in the template structure, can still coordinate Ca2+. LG3 Mutants Maintain their Secondary Structure and Exhibit Lower Affinity for Ca2+—Based on evidence from our LG3 model, we designed mutations of the two residues, the side chains of which are predicted to coordinate calcium, D4258A, N4327A, and a D4258A/N4327A double mutant. Electrostatic potential surface analysis of the designed mutants showed a loss of negative charge in the predicted binding pocket in the D4258A and D4258A/N4327A mutants (Fig. 3, C and D). Although the N4327A mutation understandably does not greatly alter surface electrostatics, loss of the carbonyl oxygen from the Asn4327 side chain should interfere with Ca2+ coordination. The designed mutations are located at the bases of predicted loop regions, not within conserved areas of secondary structure. In fact, a mutational and structural analysis of laminin α2LG4–LG5 has previously indicated that homologous Ca2+-binding site mutations in the α2LG4–LG5 domains did not disrupt the secondary protein structure (as in our case, see below) but did abolish Ca2+ binding and significantly reduced binding to α-dystroglycan (32Wizemann H. Garbe J.H. Friedrich M.V. Timpl R. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). All recombinant mutants migrated as a doublet on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A), likely due to differential glycosylation as reported previously (14Friedrich M.V.K. Go ̈hring W. Mo ̈rgelin M. Brancaccio A. David G. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis (using tools obtainable at the Technical University of Denmark) revealed the presence of at least three and up to five potential sites of O-linkages in LG3 but no N-linkages. All fragments started with a single APLA sequence derived from the expression vector (24Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1432-1440Cro"

Physical models of a common swift wing in gliding posture with a 60° sweep of the sharp hand-wing leading edge were tested in a water tunnel. Interactions with the flow were measured quantitatively with digital particle image velocimetry at Reynolds numbers realistic for the gliding flight of a swift between 3750 and 37,500. The results show that gliding swifts can generate stable leading-edge vortices at small (5° to 10°) angles of attack.

Because sediment resuspension is a prelude to transport, supercell events are a necessary condition for major sediment transport.

Homologous recombination is known to be the dominant process in the divergence of many bacterial species. For Archaea, the only direct evidence bearing on the importance or natural occurrence of homologous recombination is anecdotal reports of mosaicism from comparative genomic studies. Genetic studies, however, reveal that recombination may play a significant role in generating diversity among members of at least one archaeal group, the haloarchaea. We used multi-locus sequence typing to demonstrate that haloarchaea exchange genetic information promiscuously, exhibiting a degree of linkage equilibrium approaching that of a sexual population."
https://openalex.org/W1964681919,"Regulated changes in the affinity of integrin adhesion receptors (“activation”) play an important role in numerous biological functions including hemostasis, the immune response, and cell migration. Physiological integrin activation is the result of conformational changes in the extracellular domain initiated by the binding of cytoplasmic proteins to integrin cytoplasmic domains. The conformational changes in the extracellular domain are likely caused by disruption of intersubunit interactions between the α and β transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains. Here, we reasoned that mutation of residues contributing to α/β interactions that stabilize the low affinity state should lead to integrin activation. Thus, we subjected the entire intracellular domain of the β3 integrin subunit to unbiased random mutagenesis and selected it for activated mutants. 25 unique activating mutations were identified in the TM and membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain. In contrast, no activating mutations were identified in the more distal cytoplasmic tail, suggesting that this region is dispensable for the maintenance of the inactive state. Among the 13 novel TM domain mutations that lead to integrin activation were several informative point mutations that, in combination with computational modeling, suggested the existence of a specific TM helix-helix packing interface that maintains the low affinity state. The interactions predicted by the model were used to identify additional activating mutations in both the α and β TM domains. Therefore, we propose that helical packing of the α and β TM domains forms a clasp that regulates integrin activation.

Integrin heterodimers are essential for the development and functioning of multicellular animals, because they mediate cell migration and cell adhesion and can influence gene expression and cell proliferation (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6951) Google Scholar). All of the integrin heterodimers are composed of single pass Type I transmembrane (TM) 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; TMD, transmembrane domain; LIBS, ligand-induced binding site. protein subunits α and β. A central feature of these receptors is their capacity for rapid changes in their adhesive function mediated by changes in their ligand binding affinity, operationally defined here as “activation.” The prototypical integrin, platelet αIIbβ3, is activated through interactions of the cytoplasmic integrin tails (∼20 and 47 residues for α and β tails, respectively) with intracellular proteins such as talin (2Campbell I.D. Ginsberg M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 429-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These interactions initiate a long-range conformational change in the large extracellular domains (>700 residues each), resulting in high affinity binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and fibronectin and consequently platelet aggregation and adherence to the vessel wall (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6951) Google Scholar). Initial mutational studies suggested that a salt bridge between αIIbArg995 and β3Asp723 helps maintain the integrin in the low affinity state by forming part of an interactive face between α and β subunit cytoplasmic domains (3Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Protein engineering studies from Springer laboratory have further advanced the idea that specific integrin α/β interactions maintain the low affinity conformation of the receptor. In particular, enforced association of either the C-terminal region of the extracellular domains (4Takagi J. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) or that of the cytoplasmic domains (5Lu C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14642-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) leads to expression of an inactive integrin. Furthermore, during physiological integrin activation, changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer between fluorophores joined to the αL and β2 cytoplasmic domains are consistent with cytoplasmic domain separation (6Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Finally, constraining the integrin α and β transmembrane domains with intersubunit disulfide bonds blocks integrin activation from inside the cell. However, this constraint does not prevent activation by divalent cations and antibodies that activate by binding to the extracellular domain (7Luo B.H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 776-786Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that default low affinity state of integrins is maintained by interactions between integrin α and β subunits and that physiological activation occurs when cytoplasmic domain ligands, such as talin, disrupt these interactions. Support for the idea that an Arg995-Asp723 salt bridge is an important constraint for the low affinity state comes from a NMR spectroscopy study (8Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Velyviene A. Hu B. Haas T. Plow E. Qin J. Cell. 2002; 110: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Specifically, in isolated αIIb and β3 cytoplasmic domain peptides, the salt bridge was identified as part of a helical interface between the membrane-proximal regions of α and β subunits. Furthermore, this interaction was disrupted by talin, supporting the notion that disruption of this salt bridge is involved in integrin activation (8Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Velyviene A. Hu B. Haas T. Plow E. Qin J. Cell. 2002; 110: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). However, other groups have failed to observe intersubunit interactions in the membrane-proximal region, suggesting that it is of relatively low affinity (9Ulmer T.S. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7498-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 10Li R. Babu C.R. Lear J.D. Wand A.J. Bennett J.S. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12462-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional intracellular regions of the receptor could contribute α/β interactions to “clasp” it into the low affinity state. Indeed, in vitro model systems identified heterodimeric interactions between integrin α and β TM domains (11Schneider D. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9840-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and such interactions have also been suggested by molecular modeling (12Gottschalk K.E. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Kessler H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1800-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Adair B.D. Yeager M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14059-14064Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and disulfide crosslinking approaches (7Luo B.H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 776-786Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Mutation of residues contributing to α/β interactions that stabilize the low affinity state should lead to integrin activation. Thus, we subjected the entire intracellular domain (cytoplasmic plus TM domain in Fig. 1) of the β3 integrin subunit to unbiased random mutagenesis and selected it for activated mutants. Through this analysis, we have confirmed the importance of the membrane-proximal domain in maintenance of the low affinity state. In contrast, no activating mutations were identified in the more distal cytoplasmic tail suggesting that this region is dispensable for the maintenance of the inactive state. This approach also identified 13 novel TM domain mutations that lead to integrin activation. Among these were several informative point mutations that suggested the existence of a TM helix-packing interface that maintains the low affinity state. Computational modeling indicates that these mutations disrupted intersubunit interactions either directly or indirectly by altering helical length/tilt angle. The interactions predicted in the model were used to create additional activating mutations in both the α and β TM domains. Therefore, we propose that α and β TM regions interact to form a clasp that constrains integrin activation. Cell Culture, Cell Lines, and Reagents—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids (Sigma), 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin sulfate/ml in a 37 °C tissue culture incubator. αIIbC5 cells from an αIIb integrin subunit-expressing CHO cell line were created by transfecting CHO cells with CDM8 vectors encoding the αIIb integrin subunit along with CD-neomycin plasmid. Stable colonies were selected with neomycin for 2 weeks. The pooled stable colonies were subsequently infected with an adenovirus encoding β3 integrin subunit and sorted for single cells expressing αIIbβ3 integrin. Each individual stable clone was then examined for the absence of β3 subunit to make sure that the adenovirus had not integrated into the genome. The clones that do not express β3 subunit were then transiently transfected with a plasmid that encodes β3 and tested for expression of αIIbβ3. The clones that revealed normal expression of αIIbβ3 after transient expression of β3 subunit were then used for further studies. The anti-αIIbβ3 antibodies D57, PAC1, and anti-LIBS6 as well as Ro43-5054, an αIIbβ3-specifc peptide-mimetic competitive inhibitor, have been described previously (14O'Toole T.E. Mandelman D.

Blood. 1992; 80: 2539-2547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The D57 antibody was biotinylated with biotin-N-hydroxy-succinimide (B-D57, Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Construction of Random Mutagenic cDNA Libraries of β3 Integrin Subunit—To facilitate construction of random mutagenic cDNA libraries of transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of β3 integrin subunit, a SphI restriction enzyme site was created via a silent mutation at nucleotide 1899 (C→ A) of β3 cDNA sequence using site-directed mutagenesis. The SphI site-containing full-length β3 cDNA was then subcloned into a hygromycin-resistant derivative of CDM8 expression vector (Invitrogen), CDHYG, to create a wide-type β3-expressing vector, CDHYG3A.SphI. Transiently transfection of this construct in a αIIb-expressing CHO cell line, αIIbC5, or co-transfection with wild-type αIIb cDNA in CHO cells resulted in a protein product with properties identical to those of wild-type αIIbβ3. Specifically, the mutant species was immunoprecipitated by D57 (data not shown), an antibody against the extracellular domains of αIIbβ3, and was found to be in the low affinity state because it failed to bind PAC1, a monoclonal antibody specific for the high affinity state of αIIbβ3. Furthermore, the SphI construct gained PAC1 binding ability with treatment of an αIIbβ3-activating antibody anti-LIBS6 but failed to bind PAC1 in the presence of Ro43-5054, an αIIbβ3-specifc peptide-mimetic competitive inhibitor (data not shown). Thus, this silent mutation does not interfere with the normal expression or function of β3 integrin subunit. The spiked megaprimer method was chosen to generate random mutagenic cDNA libraries of β3 cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (18Hermes J.D. Parekh S.M. Blacklow S.C. Koster H. Knowles J.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 84: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Specifically, the β3 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains were divided into four “windows” of 66 nucleotides, each with a nine-nucleotide overlap between windows (Fig. 1). Spiked oligonucleotide primers corresponding to each window (Fig. 1) were synthesized with a contamination level of 1.5% incorrect phosphoramidites, i.e. 0.5% of each of the three other bases. PCR was performed using the spiked primer (Fig. 2A, S.M.P.) for each window and a 3′-reverse primer that contains an XbaI restriction enzyme site (Fig. 2A, R.P.). For a second round of PCR reactions (Fig. 2A, PCR-II), the PCR-I product (megaprimer) was used as a reverse primer. PCR reaction was performed with the megaprimer and a forward primer that contains the SphI site (Fig. 2A, F.P.). Products from PCR-II were then subcloned into SphI-XbaI sites of CDHYG3A.SphI. The efficiency of random mutagenesis was assessed by cDNA sequencing of 10 randomly picked transformants from each window. cDNA sequencing indicated that ∼70% inserts in each window contained 1, 2, or 3 point mutations, which is in the reasonable range of efficiency for random mutagenesis. Theoretically, for a window of 66 nucleotides, 150,000 transformants should cover 99% of the possible one-base changes and ∼75% of the possible two-base changes. Therefore, a random mutagenic cDNA library containing ∼200,000 transformants for each window of transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of β3 subunit was constructed by large-scale preparation of transformants and used for subsequent transfection into αIIbC5 cells and identification of activating mutations in the β3 subunit. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutations in both the αIIb and β3 subunits were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and pCDM8 vectors containing the integrin subunits. Mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Flow Cytometry—Random mutagenic cDNA library corresponding to each window of β3 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains was transfected into αIIC5 cells by electroporation. Stable colonies were selected for 2 weeks in the presence of both hygromycin (750 μg/ml) and neomycin (750 μg/ml). Approximately 5 × 106 cells from pooled stable colonies from each window were then individually sorted on a FACStar Plus (BD Biosciences) using two-color flow cytometry. The biotinylated monoclonal antibody, B-D57, was used to detect the expression of αIIbβ3, whereas PAC1, an activation-specific monoclonal IgM antibody was used to assess the activation state of the αIIbβ3 integrin. For single cell sorting, the pooled stable colonies from each window (∼5 × 106 cells/each window) were resuspended by treatment with trypsin and double-stained as described previously (19O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R.N. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 20Hughes P.E.

Rare cells that exhibited both bright phycoerythrin staining (D57) and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining (PAC1) were individually sorted into 96-well plates. FACS analysis of isolated clonal cell lines was performed on a FACScan using both B-D57 and PAC1 antibodies as described previously (19O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R.N.

In some cases, treatment with anti-LIBS6 was used to estimate maximal PAC1 binding because anti-LIBS6 directly induces αIIbβ3 binding to PAC1 regardless of the status of cellular activation mechanism (15Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For retransfection analysis, αIIbC5 cells were transfected with plasmid CDHYG3A.SphI, encoding wild-type or mutant β3, using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection, the transfected cells were stained with B-D57 and PAC1 in the presence and absence of Ro43-5054 and FACS analysis was performed as described above. Cytometric analysis of the site-directed mutations was done by cotransfection of the pCDM8 plasmids containing the αIIb and β3 subunits with Plus reagent and Lipofectamine. 48 h after transfection, the transfected cells were stained with B-D57 and PAC1 in the presence and absence of Ro43-5054 and anti-LIBS6 and FACS analysis was performed as described above. Activation index was calculated by using the formula (F - F0)/(Fmax - F0), where F = PAC1 binding, F0 = PAC1 binding in the presence of Ro43-5054, and Fmax = PAC1 binding in the presence of anti-LIBS6. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR, Subcloning, and Sequencing of β3 Integrin Subunit—Total cellular RNA from each individual cell line was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) primer and the cDNA Cycle kit (Invitrogen), and PCR was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes SphI and XbaI to create a fragment of ∼550 bp. This SphI-XbaI fragment was then subcloned into the SphI-XbaI sites of CDHYG3A. SphI vector and sequenced using primers derived from CDHYG3A.SphI plasmid but outside of the SphI-XbaI region. To eliminate possible PCR errors, at least four clones were sequenced for each mutant cell line.

The TMD sequences of integrin αIIb and β3 subunits were built into uniform α-helices having the backbone torsion angles of φ = -65° and Ψ = -40°. Their TMD sequences of αIIb and β3 were aligned based on the glycosylmappingdata (22Armulik A. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Johansson S. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 329: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The αIIb and β3 TMD dimeric structures then were filtered to remove the structures incompatible with the bilayer constraints. We then clustered the remaining structures by Cα root mean square distances using NMR CLUSTER (25Kelley L.A. Gardner S.P. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1063-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), which resulted in two equally populated clusters: one with a crossing point near the N terminus and the other with a crossing point close to C terminus. Both models were evaluated for consistency with the experimental results (see below). Random Mutagenesis Identifies Novel Integrin Activating Mutations in the TM and Membrane-proximal Cytoplasmic Regions of β3—To generate the β3 random mutants, we used CDHYG3A.SphI as a template and spiked oligonucleotide primers corresponding to four overlapping windows that cover the entire β3 intracellular domain (Fig. 1). Using the protocol outlined (see “Experimental Procedure” and Fig. 2), a cDNA library containing ∼200,000 transformants for each window was constructed by large-scale preparation of transformants and used for subsequent transfection into an αIIb-expressing cell line (αIIbC5 cells) and identification of activating mutations in the β3 subunit. We developed a library of stable cell lines and selected activated αIIbβ3 integrin mutants by their binding to PAC1, an antibody specific for activated αIIbβ3 (Fig. 3A, R2) (15Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this approach, we isolated 91 and 192 cell lines bearing activated αIIbβ3 from windows I and II, respectively (Table I). In contrast, only five cell lines were isolated from either window III or window IV (Table I). Thus, mutations in the membrane-distal segments of the β3 cytoplasmic domain encoded by regions III and IV were less likely to activate αIIbβ3 integrin.Table IClonal cell lines with activated αIIβ3WindowCell lines isolatedActivation reconfirmedUnique mutations identifiedI288917II46819222III6550IV3000 Open table in a new tab The cell lines expressing activated integrin αIIbβ3 could have arisen as a consequence of mutations within the target window from adventitious mutations elsewhere in the integrin or from mutations in genes that indirectly control integrin activation. To identify mutations in the target window that activated αIIbβ3, we sequenced cDNA clones obtained from β3 reverse transcriptase-PCR amplicons spanning this region. To confirm that sequenced mutations were responsible for integrin activation, these amplicons were used to replace this region in wild-type β3. The resulting plasmids were transfected into αIIbC5 cells and tested for PAC1 binding in the presence and absence of Ro43-5054. When the transiently expressed mutant integrin was able to bind PAC1 and this PAC1 binding was inhibited by Ro43-5054, we concluded that the mutation was responsible for the activation of αIIbβ3. A total of 25 unique mutations in the transmembrane and membrane-proximal region of cytoplasmic domain of β3 subunit thus were identified, and there were multiple examples of the same mutations present in different clonal cell lines (Fig. 4). 13 of them were found N-terminal of Lys716 in the presumptive transmembrane domain, and 12 were in the membrane-proximal region of cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 5). No mutation was identified that only affected the region of the cytoplasmic domain C-terminal of Asp723 (Fig. 5). The absence of activating mutations C-terminal of Asp723 indicates that the C terminus of β3 is not involved in the maintenance of the low affinity state of the integrin. The presence of such mutations in the membraneproximal and transmembrane domains suggests that these sites are important in regulating integrin activation.Fig. 5Frequency of activating mutations in the β3 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains.

Consequently, we focused our attention on the numerous mutations in the transmembrane domain. Many of these mutations would be predicted to shorten the β-subunit TM helix (i.e. fewer residues embedded in the membrane) by deletion of one or more residues or by introduction of a charged residue (Table II). Indeed, the majority of the mutations (9 of 13) would be expected to disrupt or shorten the TM helix. Previous glycosylation-mapping studies (22Armulik A. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Johansson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37030-37034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Stefansson A. Armulik A. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Johansson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21200-21205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) indicated that activating mutations in the membrane-proximal domain can shorten the TM helix. The present results extend those findings by showing that such mutations throughout the TM helix activate the integrin.Table IIActivating β3 transmembrane mutationsMutations that directly shorten the TM helix (loop-out and truncation mutations)Δ(Val695Val696)Leu697 → Pro and Δ(Leu698-Ser699-Val700)Δ(Ser699-Val700)Leu709→His & Δ(Leu697-Leu698)Trp715 → StopMutations that are predicted to shorten the TM helix (apolar to charged mutations)Leu697 → ArgLeu712 → ArgLeu713 → HisTrp715 → ArgMutations that are not predicted to shorten the TM helixGly708 → SerAla711 → Thr & Thr720→AlaIle714 → ThrIle714 → Thr & Δ(Ile721) Open table in a new tab Mutagenesis of Predicted TM Packing Residues Activates αIIbβ3—A subset (4 of 13) of the membrane-embedded activating mutations had no obvious effect on TM helical length. This finding suggests that the TM segments help stabilize the inactive state through sequence-specific interactions. To investigate this possibility, we used a Monte Carlo simulation method (21Kim S. Chamberlain A.K. Bowie J.U. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) to produce a first approximation of the intersubunit packing of integrin TM domains. We caution that this method assumes idealized rigid α helices and disregards potential changes in membrane insertion. However, several reports indicate that this protocol does yield models that conform well to known structural and functional data (21Kim S. Chamberlain A.K. Bowie J.U. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Melnyk R.A. Kim S. Curran A.R. Engelman D.M. Bowie J.U. Deber C.M. J. Biol.

A. 2004; 101: 5988-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here, the resulting output predicted two alternative structures, one with the TM helices packing near the C termini (Fig. 6, Structure A) and another with the helices packing close to the N termini (Structure B). The random mutagenesis data focused our attention on Structure A, because all of the uncharged activating point mutations clustered in the C-terminal region of the β3 TM domain (G708S, A711T,T720A, and I714T) (Fig. 5). Indeed, each of these mutations affected a residue predicted to be a helical contact in Structure A (Fig. 6B). Three additional sitedirected mutants were employed to test the hypothesis that the interhelical interface predicted in Structure A functioned as a clasp to maintain the integrin in the low affinity state (vida infra). The β3(G708S) mutation was strongly activating. Previous studies (30Li R. Mitra N. Gratkowski H. Vilaire G. Litvinov R. Nagasami C. Weisel J.W. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. Science. 2003; 300: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) have shown that the introduction of an Asn at this position activated αIIbβ3 and suggested that it did so by forming hydrogen bonds that favor β3 homo-oligomerization. The Ser substitution could also, in principle, lead to enhanced β3-β3 interactions through such a mechanism. However, the weakly polar nature of the Ser side chain coupled with the observation that insertion of the bulky aliphatic Ile residue at this position (β3(G708I) mutation) was strongly activating suggests that a Gly residue is strictly required at this position for efficient α/β TM packing (Fig. 7, A–C). The packing motif in Structure A allowed us to identify an additional Van der Waals packing residue that helps stabilize the inactive state, because the apolar to apolar I704A mutation resulted in an activated integrin (Fig. 7, B and C). Also, the Structure A model predicted that αIIb TM residues would pack against the identified β3 residues. Accordingly, we substituted a bulky Ile residue for αIIb Thr981, the residue predicted to pack against β3 Gly708 (Fig. 6B). The observation that this mutant activated αIIbβ3 supports the packing of Thr981 against Gly708, an interaction that would be stabilized by both Van der Waals packing and a potential Cα/hydroxyl hydrogen bond. Overall, both random mutagenesis and site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 7C) support the hypothesis that the specific packing of the C-terminal portions of αIIb and β3 transmembrane helices against each other maintains the low affinity state of integrin αIIbβ3. Activation by mutagenically dissociating the integrin TM helices is consistent with reports that suggest that activation is associated with separation of the cytoplasmic domains (2Campbell I.D. Ginsberg M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 429-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). However, the unbiased random mutagenesis approach identified a preponderance of activating TM domain mutations predicted to shorten the β3 TM domain, indicating that TM helix shortening can also lead to integrin activation. In agreement with this mechanism, previous glycosylation mapping studies suggested that the membrane-proximal domains of the α and β subunits can reside with the membrane bilayers and that certain activating mutations in this region (22Armulik A. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Johansson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37030-37034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Stefansson A. Armulik A. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Johansson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21200-21205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) result in a shortened TM domain. How might shortening the TM domain lead to disruption of intracellular α/β interactions and consequent integrin activation? To avoid hydrophobic mismatch with the fixed width of the membrane bilayer, a shortened TM helix would change its membrane tilt angle and associated register with neighboring helices (31de Planque M.R. Killian J.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Because helix-helix packing is dependent on specific crossing angles and specific in-register side chain arrays, changes to TM helical length would break the proposed clasp. Previous observations showing that αIIb sequences with a shortened TM segment (7Luo B.H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 776-786Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar) lost the ability to induce a periodic disulfide cross-linking pattern of the αIIb and β3 transmembrane helices support this notion. In addition, the inactive state intersubunit interactions at membrane-proximal level could cooperate with the TM packing to help maintain the α/β association. Importantly, talin has been shown to bind to the membrane-proximal region (8Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Velyviene A. Hu B. Haas T. Plow E. Qin J. Cell. 2002; 110: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 32Patil S. Jedsadayanmata A. Wencel-Drake J.D. Wang W. Knezevic I. Lam S.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8307-8312Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), an event that appears to be important for αIIbβ3 activation (33Ulmer T.S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8307-8312Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This interaction could contribute to the physiological activation of integrins in two separate but related ways. First, one consequence of talin binding to this region would be to displace the membrane-proximal domain from the bilayer, thereby shortening the TM domain. As noted above, this process would probably lead to separation of the intracellular domains. Talin binding could also directly disrupt the cooperative membrane proximal/TM clasp by breaking the Arg995-Asp723 salt bridge (8Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Velyviene A. Hu B. Haas T. Plow E. Qin J. Cell. 2002; 110: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) and associated intersubunit interactions. Our findings also have implications for integrin-mediated biochemical signals that control cell shape, cell migration, proliferation, and survival. The capacity of integrins to deliver such signals depends on their occupancy with resultant conformational change in the integrin (34Diaz-Gonzalez F. Forsyth J. Steiner B. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) in combination with receptor clustering (35Guan J.-L. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O.

These conformational changes are associated with a dramatic change in the quaternary structure of the integrin, resulting in a switch from a “bent” conformation observed in the crystal structure (37Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; : 1064535Google Scholar) to an extended one (38Takagi J. Strokovich K. Springer T.A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14461-14474Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) that would disrupt the TM helical packing proposed here. This disruption could lead to the changes in the intracellular interactions of occupied integrins manifested by focal adhesion targeting and transdominant inhibition (34Diaz-Gonzalez F. Forsyth J. Steiner B. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 40LaFlamme S.E. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the work of Li et al. (10Li R. Babu C.R. Lear J.D. Wand A.J. Bennett J.S. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12462-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) shows that isolated integrin α and β TM peptides homo-oligomerize, a process that could contribute to integrin clustering. This finding suggests a sequential model in which α/β transmembrane separation might then be followed by homo-oligomerization to favor receptor clustering (10Li R. Babu C.R. Lear J.D. Wand A.J.

Science. 2003; 300: 755-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the mutational studies of Li et al. (30Li R. Mitra N. Gratkowski H. Vilaire G. Litvinov R. Nagasami C. Weisel J.W. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. Science. 2003; 300: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) identify β3 Gly708 as an important packing residue for β3 homo-oligomerization and suggest that homo-oligomerization may occur after TM separation. Our findings indicating that Gly708 also participates in an α/β interaction that regulates activation lends additional credence to this hypothesis and suggests that the TM helix packing interface proposed here is a nexus for bidirectional transmembrane signaling through integrins. Note Added in Proof—Recently, two other groups (41Li W. Metcalf D. Gorelik R. Li R. Mitra N. Nanda V. Law P.B. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. U. S.

Hence, double positive (DP) thymocytes expressing CD4 and CD8 coreceptors are usually viewed simply as progenitors of CD4+ and CD8+ alphabeta T cells. Instead we report that DP cells regulate the differentiation of early thymocyte progenitors and gammadelta cells, by a mechanism dependent on the transcription factor RORgt, and the lymphotoxin (LT) beta receptor (LTbetaR). This finding provokes a revised view of the thymus, in which lymphoid tissue induction-type processes coordinate the developmental and functional integration of the two T cell lineages."

Cell. 1998; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1472) Google Scholar, 22Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A.

Res. 2001; 480 –481: 243-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). NF-κB is activated by several endogenous inducers and at the same time regulates the expression of some of these inducers. For example, TNF-α is a potent inducer of NF-κB and also is regulated by NF-κB. TNF-α activates NF-κB by recruitment of NIK followed by IKK and thereby phosphorylates IκBα, which leads to the degradation of IκBα and subsequent release of NF-κB (22Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Aggarwal B.B. Natarajan K. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1996; 7: 93-124PubMed Google Scholar). Once NF-κB is activated, it drives the expression of several genes having NF-κB responsive elements within their promoters. These include proinflammatory genes like TNF-α, IL-1, IFNγ, Cox-2, and genes involved in tumorigenesis such as adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteases, and also chemokines like IL-8 (26Karashima T.

Chest. 2000; 117: 1482-1487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Several reports suggest the regulation of IL-8 production, which is one of the key mediators of inflammation by NF-κB (28Message S.D. Johnston S.L. J. Leukoc.

As discussed earlier, IL-8 is a potent chemokine involved in inflammation and cancer. We were interested to determine whether IL-8 can also regulate NF-κB, similar to TNF, IL-1, and IL-10 (26Karashima T. Sweeney P. Kamat A. Huang S. Kim S.J. Bar-Eli M. McConkey D.J. Dinney C.P. Clin.

TRAF6 is the only TRAF family member that participates in signal transduction of both the TNF receptor superfamily and the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R)/Toll-like receptor (TLR) superfamily through the recruitment of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) (32Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothek B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevdeq N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Duk K. Singh S. Pikeq J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Chemoattractants (FMLP, PAF, C3a, and C5a) bind their respective seven transmembrane-spanning G-protein-coupled receptors, and subsequently activate the transcription factor NF-κB (40Browning D.D.

Formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (FMLP)-mediated activation of NF-κB is caused by stimulation of RhoA, a small GTPase activity (43Chen L.Y. Zuraw B.L. Ye R.D. Pan Z.K. Rho A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7208-7212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However a recent report suggests that Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus G protein-coupled receptor is homologous to the IL-8R and activates AP-1 and CREB via the Erk1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways, whereas NF-κB activation is independent of PI3K/Akt (44Cannon M.L. Cesarman E. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study we clearly demonstrate that IL-8 acts as a potent activator of NF-κB. IL-8 also induces NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression and NF-κB-dependent genes such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and Cox-2. IL-8 also induces JNK and MAPK in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. IL-8-mediated induction of NF-κB was not influenced by DN-TRADD, -FADD, and -TRAF2 but was inhibited by DN-TRAF6, -NIK, and -IKK, indicating involvement of these in IL-8-mediated activation of NF-κB. From the results we obtained for IL-8 using the DN constructs, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) knock-out cells, or TRAF6-binding peptide (TRAF6-BP), which inhibits TRAF6-mediated cell signaling (45Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2004; 104: 4113-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) we demonstrate that IL-8 might function through recruitment of IRAK and TRAF6 followed by NIK, IKK, finally leading to the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα thereby activating NF-κB. IL-8 mediates its action partially through induction of the GTPase pathway, like FMLP and induces NF-κB. With already existing data on the importance of IL-8 in inflammation and angiogenesis, and our finding that IL-8 activates NF-κB, we can say that one of the mechanisms of IL-8-mediated inflammation is through activation of NF-κB. In this report we are providing the data on IL-8-mediated NF-κB activation, unlike other chemoattractants, through the IRAK-TRAF6 pathway, which might be helpful in understanding its involvement for metastasis and new vascularization. Further our results make IL-8 an important therapeutic target in diseases involving the aberrant regulation of either IL-8 or NF-κB. Materials—Glycine, dithiothreitol, leupeptin, FMLP, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, 4-methyl umbelliferyl phosphate, bovine serum albumin, and anti-tubulin antibody were obtained from Sigma. Penicillin, streptomycin, RPMI 1640 medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). IL-8 was obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). TNF was obtained from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Antibodies against IL-1R1, IL-1R2, IL-8, IL-8R, TLR4, p65, IKKα, IκBα, c-Rel, JNK, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, ERK, CRM1, and Cox-2 and double-stranded Oct1 gel shift oligonucleotide were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Cell-permeable TRAF6-binding peptide with Kaposi fibroblast growth factor leader sequence (AAVALLPAVLLALLAP-RKIPTEDEYTDRPSQPST; leader sequence in italics), and the mutant TRAF6-binding peptide (AAVALLPAVLLALLAP-RKIATADEATDRPSQPST; leader sequence in italics and mutated amino acids underlined) were chemically synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Recombinant C3 toxin was kindly provided by Prof. G. S. Chhatwal (German Center for Biotechnology, Braunschweig, Germany). The plasmid constructs for p65, NF-κB-SEAP, Cox-2-luciferase, and dominant-negative constructs for TRADD, FADD, TRAF2, TRAF6, NIK, IKK, and IκBα were kindly supplied by Prof. B. B. Aggarwal of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX. Cell Lines—The cell lines used in this study were as follows: U-937 (histiocytic lymphoma), HeLa (epithelial cells), THP1 (monocytic cells), H4 (glial cells), and RAW264.7 (mouse macrophages). These cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The IRAK knock-out HEK293 cells (lacks IRAK protein and mRNA) and IRAK-reconstituted cells (restoration of IRAK in IRAK knock-out cells, which restored their responsiveness to IL-1) (46Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 464-4652Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Xiaoxia Li, Dept. of Immunology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, OH. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and neutrophils were isolated from fresh blood by the Ficoll-Hipaque method (47Manna S.K. Samanta S. Samanta A.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5042-5052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). U-937, THP-1, and IRAK-reconstituted and knock-out HEK293 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium whereas others were in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). All cells were free from mycoplasma. NF-κB Activation Assay—To determine NF-κB activation, EMSA was conducted essentially as described (48Sreenivasan Y. Sarkar A. Manna S.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4356-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 μg of nuclear extract proteins were incubated with 32P end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotides from HIV-LTR, 5′-TTG TTA CAA GGG ACT TTC CGC TGG GGA CTT TCC AGG GAG GCG TGG-3′ (bold indicates NF-κB binding site) for 30 min at 37 °C, and the DNA-protein complex formed was separated from free oligonucleotide on 6.6% native polyacrylamide gels. The specificity of binding was examined by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides. Visualization and quantitation of radioactive bands were done as indicated above. NF-κB-dependent Reporter Gene Transcription Assay—The IL-8-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription was measured as described previously (49Manna S.K. Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Briefly, U-937 cells were transiently transfected with Qiagen SuperFect transfection reagent (Hilden, Germany) with 1 ml of medium containing dominant-negative plasmid DNAs for TRADD, FADD, TRAF2, TRAF6, NIK, IKK, or IκBα (1 μg each) along with 0.5 μg of NF-κB promoter DNA linked to the heat-stable secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) and green fluorescent peptide (GFP) constructs. The total amount of DNA was maintained at 3 μg by the addition of the control plasmid pCMVFLAG1 DNA. After 3 h, cells were washed, cultured for 12 h, and then treated with IL-8 or TNF for 24 h. Cell culture-conditioned medium was harvested, and 25 μl was analyzed for SEAP activity essentially as per the Clontech protocol (Palo Alto, CA). The average number (± S.D.) of relative fluorescent light units for each transfection was then determined and reported as fold activation with respect to control vector-transected cells. This reporter system was specific, because TNF-induced NF-κB SEAP activity was inhibited by overexpression of IκBα mutants lacking either Ser32 or Ser36 (49Manna S.K. Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). For transfection control, cells were co-transfected with β-galactosidase, and the activity was assayed from each transfection. For transfection efficiency, the GFP-positive cells were counted under a fluorescent microscope. Cox-2-dependent Reporter Gene Transcription—IL-8- and TNF-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression was carried out as described before (50Sarkar A. Sreenivasan Y. Ramesh G.T. Manna S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33768-33781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). U-937 cells were transiently co-transfected with SuperFect transfection reagent with 1 μg of Cox-2-luciferase plasmid and 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase. After 3 h, cells were washed and stimulated with different concentrations of either IL-8 or TNF for 24 h. The cell pellets were extracted with lysis buffer (part of the luciferase assay kit from Promega). Cell extracts were incubated with the firefly luciferin (substrate, Promega). Light emission was monitored with a luminometer, and values were calculated as fold activation over vector-transfected value. The activity of β-galactosidase was assayed from the same extracts. Immunocytochemistry—The effect of IL-8 on nuclear translocation of p65 was examined by the immunocytochemical method as described (50Sarkar A. Sreenivasan Y. Ramesh G.T. Manna S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33768-33781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, after treatment cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-human p65 antibody followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alex-Fluor. Cells were mounted with mounting medium with DAPI (to counterstain the nucleus) and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope. JNK Assay—JNK was assayed by a modified method as described earlier (49Manna S.K. Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells, stimulated with either different concentrations of IL-8 or different times with IL-8 (100 ng/ml) were extracted, and the cell extract (250 μg/treatment) was used to detect JNK activity using GST-Jun as substrate. MAPK Kinase Assay—U-937 cells, stimulated with either different concentrations of IL-8 or at different time periods with IL-8 (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C and phosphorylated MAPK, were assayed using phosphospecific anti-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (New England Biolabs) by Western blot (49Manna S.K. Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the mechanism of IL-8-mediated signal transduction. For most of the studies, U-937 cells were used, since these cells have been well characterized in our laboratory. The concentrations and duration of exposure of different inducers or chemicals employed for this study had no effect on cell viability. IL-8 Induces NF-κB Activation—To determine the effect of IL-8 on activation of NF-κB, U-937 cells (2 × 106/ml) were incubated with different concentrations of IL-8 for 2 h and nuclear extracts assayed to detect NF-κB by EMSA. IL-8-induced NF-κB activation was shown in a dose-dependent manner in U-937 cells (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that IL-8 induces NF-κB potently in U-937 cells. To determine whether the induced NF-κB band is due to IL-8-mediated cell activation, 100 ng of IL-8 was incubated with 1 μg of anti-IL-8 antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. U-937 cells were then incubated with this IL-8 and antibody mixture for 2 h at 37 °C. The nuclear extracts were prepared and assayed for NF-κB by EMSA. The results show in Fig. 1B that IL-8 induced NF-κB. Anti-IL-8 antibody alone or in combination with IL-8 did not induce NF-κB activation. This result suggests that IL-8-mediated NF-κB activation is specifically caused by IL-8-mediated signaling. To determine whether NF-κB activation is caused by IL-8, and not by endotoxin, IL-8 was incubated with anti-TLR antibody for 1 h, and then U-937 cells were stimulated with IL-8 and anti-TLR4 antibody mixture. Nuclear extracts were then assayed for NF-κB. The results in Fig. 1C show that anti-TLR antibody-preincubated IL-8 activated NF-κB similar to IL-8 alone, suggesting that IL-8-mediated NF-κB activation is not caused by endotoxin. To detect the composition and specificity of the induced band visualized by EMSA, nuclear extracts from IL-8-activated U-937 cells were incubated with Abs p50 (NF-κBI), p65 (Rel A), or in combination and 50-fold excess of cold or mutant NF-κB. Abs to either subunit of NF-κB shifted the band to a higher molecular size (Fig. 1D), thus suggesting that the IL-8-activated complex consisted of p50 and p65 subunits. Neither pre-immune serum nor irrelevant Abs such as anti-c-Rel or anti-cyclin D1 had any effect on the mobility of NF-κB. The complex completely disappeared in the presence of cold NF-κB indicating the specificity of NF-κB. Mutant NF-κB was unable to bind with the IL-8-induced protein complex, further suggesting its specificity. IL-8 Induces NF-κB-dependent Reporter Gene Expression—We have shown that IL-8 induces NF-κB activation in different cell types. To detect the role of IL-8 on NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression, U-937 cells were transiently transfected with NF-κB-containing plasmid linked to the SEAP gene GFP construct with or without IκBα-DN plasmids for 3 h followed by culture for 12 h. The GFP-positive U-937 cells were counted under a fluorescent microscope and 23 and 22% in SEAP + GFP- and SEAP + GFP + IκBα-DN-transfected pool of cells were found, respectively. Cells were stimulated with different concentrations of IL-8 or TNF (100 pm) for 24 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The SEAP activity was assayed in culture supernatant. Results are expressed as fold activity over the nontransfected control. The results in Fig. 1E show that IL-8 induced SEAP activity in a dose-dependent manner, and about 5-fold induction of SEAP activity was observed at 1000 ng/ml IL-8 or 100 pm TNF. IκBα-DN-transfected cells showed no induction of SEAP activity at any concentration of IL-8 or 100 pm TNF, suggesting IL-8 mediated induction of active NF-κB-dependent gene transcription. The SEAP-transfected cells were incubated with IL-8, TNF, or serum-activated LPS (SA-LPS) alone or in mixture with anti-TLR4 antibody (1 μg each for 1 h) for 24 h. Then SEAP activity was assayed from culture supernatant. The IL-8, TNF, or SA-LPS increased SEAP activities. The mixture of anti-TLR4 antibody with IL-8 or TNF, but not SA-LPS did not block induced SEAP activities (Fig. 1F1) indicating that IL-8- or TNF-induced NF-κB activation is not caused by endotoxin. When transfected cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml IL-8 for different times, the time-dependent activation of NF-κB-dependent SEAP activity was observed (Fig. 1F), further suggesting NF-κB-dependent SEAP induction by IL-8. The β-galactosidase activity from cell extracts showed almost similar reduction of absorbance (as per the Promega protocol) at 420 nm, suggesting the transfection control for each treatment. IL-8 Induces Phosphorylation and Degradation of IκBα—The translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus is preceded by the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteolytic degradation of IκBα (51Coliins A.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To determine whether the IL-8-mediated NF-κB activation was caused by an effect on IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent degradation, the cytoplasmic level of IκBα proteins was examined by Western blot. IκBα degradation started at 60 min of IL-8 (100 ng/ml) treatment in U-937 cells and was completed within 90 min. The band reappeared by 120 min indicating NF-κB-dependent IκBα resynthesis (Fig. 2A). To determine whether IL-8 induces IκBα phosphorylation, Western blot with antibodies against the serine-phosphorylated form of IκBα was performed. As shown in Fig. 2A, middle panel, phosphorylated IκBα band appeared at 15 and 30 min of IL-8 stimulation. At 60 and 90 min of IL-8 incubation, the IκBα bands were not visible, indicating its degradation. Upon reprobing the membrane with anti-tubulin antibody, we found that the band intensities in all lanes were uniform, indicating equal loading of extracted protein. IL-8 Induces IKK—As IL-8 induces IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent degradation, and these events occur through activation of an upstream kinase, IKK, we investigated whether IL-8 can induce IKK. U-937 cells were stimulated with IL-8 (100 ng/ml) for different times, and the IKK was assayed in vitro using GST-IκBα as substrate protein. As shown in Fig. 2B, the radiolabeled GST-IκBα bands were increased with increasing IL-8 incubation time until 45 min. At the later time, the band decreased dramatically. The results suggest that IL-8 indu"

Thus, the design of the Art v 1 polysaccharide differs from that of the well known type II arabinogalactans, and we suggest it be named type III arabinogalactan. The other type of glycosylation was formed by single (but adjacent) β-arabinofuranoses linked to hydroxyproline. In contrast to the arabinosylation of Ser-Hyp4 motifs in other hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins, such as extensins or solanaceous lectins, no oligo-arabinosides were found in Art v 1. Art v 1 and parts thereof produced by alkaline degradation, chemical deglycosylation, proteolytic degradation, and/or digestion with α-arabinofuranosidase were used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot experiments with rabbit serum and with the sera of patients. Although we could not observe antibody binding by the polysaccharide, the single hydroxyproline-linked β-arabinose residues appeared to react with the antibodies. Mono-β-arabinosylated hydroxyproline residues thus constitute a new, potentially cross-reactive, carbohydrate determinant in plant proteins.

It is a two-domain protein with a defensin-like, disulfide bond-rich domain and a proline-rich domain with much of the proline being hydroxylated.

The mature polypeptide of Art v 1 has a theoretical mass of 10.8 kDa. MALDI mass spectrometry revealed it to consist of a series of isoforms spaced by the mass of an arabinose residue, with one smaller set of peaks around 13 and a second set around 15 kDa (1Himly M. Jahn-Schmid B. Dedic A. Kelemen P. Wopfner N. Altmann F. van Ree R. Briza P. Richter K. Ebner C. Ferreira F. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Remarkably, natural and recombinant Art v 1 exhibited different IgE binding capacities, i.e. a subgroup of patients contained partly or mainly IgE binding only to the natural allergen (1Himly M. Jahn-Schmid B. Dedic A. Kelemen P. Wopfner N. Altmann F. van Ree R. Briza P. Richter K. Ebner C. Ferreira F. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Different in vivo allergenic potentials were shown by skin prick and nasal provocation tests (2Schmid-Grendelmeier P. Holzmann D. Himly M. Weichel M. Ferreira F. Tresch S. Ru ̈ckert B. Menz G.

Although various posttranslational modifications might be considered, we suspected the glycosylation state of the allergen to be the primary cause of these differences. O-Glycosylated plant proteins belong to the hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins with the two main members being arabinogalactan proteins (AGP(s)) and extensins (3Klis F.M. Montreuil J.

AGPs contain large arabinogalactan polysaccharides where the glycan part often is bigger than the protein (4Showalter A.M. Cell. Mol.

Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 277: 67-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate part of AGPs consists of a hydroxyproline-linked β1,3-d-galactan backbone having β1,6-d-galactan side chains or kinks, which in turn are substituted by arabinoses and other less abundant sugar residues (8Gane A.

The latter may occur as a single furanose residue linked to galactose or in very short chains with mainly α1,5 and maybe α1,3 linkages (2Schmid-Grendelmeier P. Holzmann D. Himly M. Weichel M.

Such arabins have been reported to consist of 1–5 arabinofuranose residues, which are joined by β1,2 and β1,3 linkages (13Ashford D. Desai N.N. Allen A.K. Neuberger A. O'Neill M.A. Selvendran R.R.

Contiguous Hyp residues form attachment sites for arabino-oligosaccharides, whereas non-contiguous, clustered Hyp residues bear arabinogalactan polysaccharides (5Tan L. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J.

Type II arabinogalactans are immunogenic, and antibodies against arabinogalactans have been employed to study the location and function of AGPs (4Showalter A.M. Cell. Mol.

Marcus S.E. Knox J.P. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 308: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Often structural elements other than arabinose are responsible for antibody binding by sera against natural AGPs (25Yates E.A. Valdor J.F. Haslam S.M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Mackie W. Knox J.P.

In the present study we report on the structure of the arabinogalactan polysaccharide and on the unexpected finding of a new type of O-glycosylation of the mugwort (A. vulgaris) pollen allergen Artv1as well as on the antibody binding abilities of these posttranslational modifications. Allergens, Antibodies, and Other Materials—Natural Art v 1 (nArt v 1) and recombinant Art v 1 (rArt v 1) were obtained as described recently (1Himly M. Jahn-Schmid B. Dedic A. Kelemen P. Wopfner N. Altmann F. van Ree R. Briza P. Richter K. Ebner C. Ferreira F. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For immunological characterization, sera of 13 mugwort pollen-allergic patients selected by typical case history, positive skin test, and radioallergosorbent test class >3.0 were used. All sera reacted specifically with nArt v 1 in immunoblots or ELISA. Serum from a non-allergic healthy subject was used for control. Rabbit antiserum was raised against nArt v 1, and a fraction specific for the posttranslational modifications of nArt v 1 was selected (rabbit anti-PTM) (1Himly M. Jahn-Schmid B. Dedic A. Kelemen P. Wopfner N. Altmann F. van Ree R. Briza P. Richter K. Ebner C. Ferreira F. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). β-Glucosyl-Yariv reagent and gum arabic were obtained from Biosupplies (Victoria, Australia). Sugar beet arabinan and Aspergillus niger α-l-arabinofuranosidase were obtained from Megazyme (Wicklow, Ireland). Potato, tomato, and Datura stramonium lectins were bought from Sigma. Degradations of nArt v 1—For alkaline degradation, nArt v 1 was incubated with 0.22 m Ba(OH)2 for 6 h at 100 °C (27Lamport D.T. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Glycopeptides were recovered by passage over Sephadex G50 fine in 25 mm ammonium acetate at pH 6.0, and fractions were analyzed for carbohydrate (28Altmann F. Schweiszer S. Weber C. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Mild acid degradation of glycopeptides was achieved by incubation with 0.2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 80 °C for 60 min. Enzymatic digestion of α-arabinosyl residues was performed in 50 mm ammonium acetate of pH 4.0 at 37 °C with A. niger α-arabinofuranosidase (0.3 units/nmol of substrate). β-Galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae (0.05 units/nmol) was subsequently added (29Zeleny R. Altmann F. Praznik W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Degraded glycopeptide was purified as above but with Sephadex G15. Larger glycopeptides from nArt v 1 were obtained by digestion with trypsin in the absence or presence of dithiothreitol (28Altmann F. Schweiszer S. Weber C. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Chemical deglycosylation was done with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid in the presence of anisole for 1 h at –20 °C (30Edge A.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Precipitation of nArt v 1 and gum arabic, as a control, was performed as described (31Qi W. Fong C. Lamport D.T.A. Plant Physiol. 1981; 96: 848-855Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Analytical Methods—Monosaccharides were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy of alditol acetates (32Altmann F. Kubelka V. Staudacher E. Uhl K. Ma ̈rz L. Insect. Biochem. 1991; 21: 467-472Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and by HPLC (33Altmann F. Lomonossoff G.P. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1111-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) after hydrolysis with 4 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 2 h. Hydroxyproline was determined by HPLC as its Fmoc (34Schuster R. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 431: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) or dansyl derivative (35Tapuhi Y. Schmidt D.E. Lindner W. Karger B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 115: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline and cis-4-hydroxy-l-proline (Sigma) were used as standards. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of Hyp-linked polysaccharide and of nArt v 1 was carried out using a Dynamo mass spectrometer (Thermo-BioAnalysis, Ltd.) in the delayed extraction mode (36Bencurova M. Hemmer W. Focke-Tejkl M. Wilson I.B.H. Altmann F. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The instrument was externally calibrated against partially hydrolyzed dextran, bee venom melittin, or porcine insulin. Dansylated Ara-Hyp was analyzed by reversed phase HPLC coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a Waters-Micromass Q-Tof Ultima Global instrument equipped with a 0.18 × 150-mm Bio-Basic18 column (Thermo Hypersil) and a 0.35 × 5-mm Opti-Pak™ C18 precolumn (Waters). A gradient from 5 to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid was formed in 40 min at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C in 3- or 1.7-mm tubes in D2Oin a 3-mm HCN probe at a Varian Unity Inova 800 instrument at 799.96 MHz for proton and 201.12 MHz for carbon, using acetone as reference for proton (2.225 ppm) and 1,4-dioxane for carbon (67.4 ppm). Varian standard programs tndqcosy, tnnoesy (mixing time of 100 ms), tntocsy (spinlock time 80 ms), gHSQC, gHSQCTOCSY (spinlock time 80 ms), gHSQCNOESY (mixing time 200 ms), and gHMBC were used with digital resolution in F2 dimension <2 Hz/pt (37Duus J.Ø. Gotfredsen C.H. Bock K. Chem. Rev. 2000; 100: 4589-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Processed spectra were assigned using the computer program PRONTO (38Kjaer M. Andersen K.V. Poulsen F.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 288-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Immunological Methods—Immunoblots with rabbit anti-PTM were performed with 0.1 μg of protein/lane as described (36Bencurova M. Hemmer W. Focke-Tejkl M. Wilson I.B.H. Altmann F. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). IgE blots were done as described previously (1Himly M. Jahn-Schmid B. Dedic A. Kelemen P. Wopfner N. Altmann F. van Ree R. Briza P. Richter K. Ebner C. Ferreira F. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In certain cases, binding to N-glycans was suppressed by the addition of bovine serum albumin-conjugated bromelain glycopeptide (10 μg/ml) to the diluted serum (39Wilson I.B.H. Harthill J.E. Mullin N. Ashford D. Altmann F. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). ELISA with the sera of the patients was performed as described previously (36Bencurova M. Hemmer W. Focke-Tejkl M. Wilson I.B.H. Altmann F. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Tris-buffered saline was used instead of phosphate-buffered saline, and 3% dry milk powder was used instead of bovine serum albumin. For coating, 0.6 ng of protein were applied to each well. Color development was performed between 2 and 16 h. ELISA with rabbit anti-PTM was performed in the same way but with a development time of 1 h. In the case of inhibition experiments, the sera were preincubated with the substance to be tested for 1 h at 37 °C. All ELISA measurements were done in triplicate. Periodate oxidation of nArt v 1 was performed with 10 mm sodium metaperiodate in 40 mm sodium acetate buffer of pH 4.2 at 4 °C. An incubation time of 7 h was found to be just sufficient to fully destroy the reactivity with rabbit anti-PTM. Overview on the Structural Analysis—nArt v 1 contained Gal and Ara in a ratio of 1:11.4. To remove the protein part, the arabinogalactan protein Art v 1 was subjected to alkaline hydrolysis, which leaves intact Hyp-linked oligosaccharides while it destroys sugars linked to serine or threonine (27Lamport D.T. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Gel filtration of the alkali digest of Art v 1 yielded three peaks (Fig. 1). The first one presumably consisted of incompletely digested material. The second, most intense, peak constituted a Hyp-linked arabinogalactan, which will be referred to as Hyp-polysaccharide (Hyp-PS). A smaller arabinose-containing peak in the inclusion volume of the column will be referred to as β-Ara-Hyp. Arabinogalactan proteins react with Yariv reagent (31Qi W. Fong C. Lamport D.T.A. Plant Physiol. 1981; 96: 848-855Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Indeed, nArt v 1 precipitated with β-glucosyl Yariv reagent as judged from dissolution and semi-quantitative SDS-PAGE of the pellet. Thus, Art v 1 can be called an AGP. although it will be shown to be an atypical one. Analysis of the Hyp-polysaccharide—The glycopeptide obtained from Art v 1 by alkaline hydrolysis contained arabinose and galactose in a molar ratio of 5.5:1 (1Himly M. Jahn-Schmid B. Dedic A. Kelemen P. Wopfner N. Altmann F. van Ree R. Briza P. Richter K. Ebner C. Ferreira F. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The Hyp-PS pool contained mainly 4-trans-Hyp accompanied by 4-cis-Hyp, an isomerization product of trans-4-Hyp (13Ashford D. Desai N.N. Allen A.K. Neuberger A. O'Neill M.A. Selvendran R.R. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The ratio of Hyp to Gal was 1:2.9, which fits well to the masses reported previously where the Hyp-glycan was shown to consist of a Hyp1Gal3Ara5–28 series (Fig. 2) (1Himly M. Jahn-Schmid B. Dedic A. Kelemen P. Wopfner N. Altmann F. van Ree R. Briza P. Richter K. Ebner C. Ferreira F. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Linkage analysis by permethylation indicated the Hyp-glycan to contain six major substitution types, terminal, 5-substituted, 2,5-, or 3,5-disubstituted and even 2,3,5-trisubstituted arabinofuranosyl residues, on one hand and 3,6-disubstituted galactopyranosyl-residues on the other (Fig. 3). The ring forms are deduced from spectra obtained for the C1-deuterated partially methylated alditol acetates of terminal arabinose and terminal galactose. These assumptions were later corroborated by enzymatic digestions and NMR. Permethylation analysis thus indicated considerable branching of the Hyp-glycan. Remethylation and control experiments did not point at undermethylation. An approximate quantitation of the substitutions can be deduced from Fig. 3 where, however, the amount of terminal Ara is certainly underestimated due the volatility of its derivative. Permethylation analysis of a Pronase glycopeptide of Art v 1 resulted in a considerably larger peak of terminal furanosidic arabinose. This difference later turned out not to be just a fluctuation in the yield of the derivative of terminal Ara but to result from Ara residues directly linked to Hyp (see below).Fig. 3Linkage analysis of the Hyp-linked polysaccharide from Art v 1. Total ion current of the gas chromatogram of the partially methylated alditol acetates from Hyp-glycan showing peaks for terminal (t-), 5-substituted, and disubstituted arabinofuranosidase as implied by the mass spectra. The arrows indicate the positions and nature of the two peaks in the chromatogram obtained with dearabinosylated Hyp-glycan (free galactan backbone).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Limited acid hydrolysis of the highly disperse polysaccharide (1Himly M. Jahn-Schmid B. Dedic A. Kelemen P. Wopfner N. Altmann F. van Ree R. Briza P. Richter K. Ebner C. Ferreira F. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) led to the disappearance of large glycans and to an accumulation of a peak of mass 640 Da which corresponds to trigalactosyl-Hyp (Fig. 2). Smaller peaks at 478 and 802 Da indicated the occurrence of additional di- and tetragalactosyl series. Similar results were obtained when Hyp-PS was incubated with α-l-arabinofuranosidase. These data imply the Art v 1 Hyp-PS consists of an inner galactosyl-core to which arabinan chains composed of mainly 3–5 α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues are attached. The galactan was sensitive to fungal β-d-galactosidase, which, notably, is essentially inactive toward β1,3-linked galactosides (29Zeleny R. Altmann F. Praznik W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The formation of free Hyp as found by HPLC after Fmoc derivatization indicated that the innermost galactose residues also had been of the β-configuration. NMR and linkage analyses (Fig. 3) indicated the d-galactoses to be β1,6 linked and not β1,3 as found in type II arabinogalactans. NMR Spectroscopy of Hyp-polysaccharide from nArt v 1— Extensive two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy of Hyp-PS was carried out at high field (800 MHz for 1H). State of the art two-dimensional approaches, such as HSQC-TOCSY and HSQC-NOESY, were used, and assignments were based on well established methods as reviewed by Duus et al. (37Duus J.Ø. Gotfredsen C.H. Bock K. Chem. Rev. 2000; 100: 4589-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Information from all the available two-dimensional data were combined with published spectral data. The assignments described were initially performed on the isolated complex mixture of Hyp-PS but subsequently confirmed for the intact glycoprotein. The data given in Table I are all for the Hyp-PS, but very similar chemical shifts were observed for the PS linked to the intact protein.Table IAssigned NMR chemical shift for residues in the oligosaccharidea The chemical shifts are given for the residue in bold.b, c The indicated chemical shifts might be interchanged.d The integral is the sum for all 5-subsituted residues.e, f, g Within each group the integral is the sum for these residues.

The structure of the backbone of the PS could clearly be assigned to be β-galactosidase-(1–6)-β-galactosidase-(1–6)-β-galactosidase-(1-O)-Hyp. The anomeric 1H signals at 4.65, 4.47, 4.52, and 4.45 ppm in an approximate ratio of 1:1:0.7:0.3, respectively, could be assigned to β-galactosidase from the chemical shifts, from the 1H–1H three bond coupling constants (J1,2 ≅ 7 Hz, J2,3 ≅ 10 Hz, J3,4 ≅ 3 Hz) and from NOE correlations between H1–H3 and H1–H5 (37Duus J.Ø.

The clear NOEs to H-γ of Hyp, 4.74 and 4.66 ppm, respectively, indicated the β-galactosidase with anomeric signals at 4.52 and 4.45 ppm was linked to two types of Hyp. The chemical shifts of the two types of Hyp could be fully assigned, but the configuration (cis or trans) could not be determined. Normally in peptide NMR (41Hill J.M. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J.

Several members were shown to function as Cl– and HCO3− transporters that likely play an important role in epithelial Cl– absorption and HCO3− secretion. However, the mechanism of most transporters is not well understood. SLC26A7 is a member of the SLC26 transporter family reported to be expressed in the basolateral membrane of the cortical collecting duct and parietal cells and functions as a coupled Cl−HCO3− exchanger. In the present work we examined the transport properties of SLC26A7 to determine its transport characteristics and electrogenicity. We found that when expressed in Xenopus oocytes or HEK293 cells SLC26A7 functions as a pHi-regulated Cl– channel with minimal OH−HCO3− permeability. Expression of SLC26A7 in oocytes or HEK293 cells generated a Cl– current with linear I/V and an instantaneous current that was voltage- and time-independent. Based on measurement of reversal potential the selectivity of SLC26A7 is (NO3−≫Cl−=Br−=I−>SO42−=Glu−, although I– partially inhibited the current. Incubating the cells with HCO3− or butyrate acidified the cytosol and increased the selectivity of SLC26A7 for Cl–. Measurement of membrane potential and pHi showed minimal OH– and HCO3− transport by SLC26A7 when the cells were incubated in Cl–-containing or Cl–-free media. The activity of SLC26A7 was inhibited by all inhibitors of anion transporters tested, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid, and glybenclamide.

These findings reveal that SLC26A7 functions as a unique Cl– channel that is regulated by intracellular H+. The SLC26 is a relatively new family of Cl– and HCO3− transporters that is coded by at least 10 genes, most of which have several splice variants (1Mount D.B. Romero M.F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Physiol. 2004; 286: F161-F169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SLC26A7 shows very restricted distribution, and so far it has been found only in gastric parietal cells (15Petrovic S. Ju X. Barone S. Seidler U. Alper S.L. Lohi H. Kere J. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G1093-G1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the intercalated cells of the outer medullary collecting duct (16Petrovic S. Barone S. Xu J. Conforti L. Ma L. Kujala M. Kere J. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F161-F169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike other members of the family that are expressed at the luminal membrane of epithelial cells (1Mount D.B. Romero M.F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 710-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), SLC26A7 was found at the basolateral membrane of both parietal cells and intercalated cells (15Petrovic S. Ju X. Barone S.

Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F161-F169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was reported that SLC26A7 functions as a coupled Cl−HCO3− exchanger (15Petrovic S. Ju X. Barone S. Seidler U. Alper S.L. Lohi H. Kere J. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G1093-G1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Petrovic S. Barone S. Xu J. Conforti L. Ma L. Kujala M. Kere J. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F161-F169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was thus suggested to play an important role in clearing HCO3− from the parietal cells during acid secretion (15Petrovic S. Ju X. Barone S. Seidler U. Alper S.L. Lohi H. Kere J. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G1093-G1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, SLC26A7 was reported to be markedly activated by cell shrinkage and thus to mediate HCO3− efflux into the hypertonic fluid of the collecting duct (16Petrovic S. Barone S. Xu J. Conforti L. Ma L. Kujala M. Kere J. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F161-F169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As part of our effort to understand the role of the SLC26 transporters in epithelial Cl– absorption and HCO3− secretion and to determine whether SLC26A7 is an electrogenic transporter, we characterized the transport properties of SLC26A7. Surprisingly, we were unable to show that SLC26A7 functions as a Cl−HCO3− exchanger or even that SLC26A7 transports much of HCO3−. In fact, of all the SLC26 transporters examined to date in our laboratory (SLC26A3, -4, -6, and -7), SLC26A7 is the least permeable to HCO3−. Rather, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes or HEK293 cells SLC26A7 behaves as a Cl– channel. The selectivity of SLC26A7 was NO3−≫Cl−=Br−. I– inhibited the current. Interestingly, SLC26A7 is regulated by pHi, where H+in does not increase the current but rather increases the selectivity of SLC26A7 for Cl–. Materials—2′,7′-Bis(2-carboxyethyl-5,6-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester was from Teff Laboratories, DIDS (4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid) was from Molecular Probes, diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DPC) was from Alexis Corp., and glybenclamide was from Sigma. All other chemicals and salts were from Sigma. The expressed sequence tag clone of mouse SLC26A7 was obtained from Invitrogen (IMAGE clone number 4020760), completely sequenced in the 5′ and 3′ directions, and subcloned into the MluI and NotI sites of the pCMV.Sport6 plasmid. The standard bath solution for HEK293 cells (solution A) contained (in mm) 145 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 10 glucose. Cl–-free media were prepared by replacing Cl– with gluconate. Solutions containing other halids or NO3− were prepared by isosmotic replacement of NaCl and KCl with the respective salts. High K+ solutions were prepared by replacing NaCl with KCl. Where indicated 40 mm Na+ butyrate replaced 40 mm NaCl. HCO3− solutions were prepared by replacing 25 mm NaCl or Na+-gluconate with 25 mmNa+-HCO3− and reducing HEPES to 5 mm. HCO3−-buffered solutions were gassed with 5% CO2 and 95% O2. The osmolarity of all solutions was adjusted to 310 mosm with the major salt. Cells—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. For functional studies HEK293 cells were co-transfected with SLC26A7 and a plasmid coding for green fluorescent protein. Green fluorescent protein fluorescence was used to identify the transfected cells. Transient transfection was by Lipofectamine. To prepare cRNA for experiments in Xenopus oocytes the plasmid pCMV.Sport6-SLC26A7 was linearized with NotI. The cRNA was transcribed using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Measurement of pHi and [Cl–]i in HEK293 Cells—The procedure for pHi measurement in HEK293 cells was identical to that described previously (17Lee M.G. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Strickland E. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14670-14677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were loaded with 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein by incubation with 5 μm 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester at room temperature for 20 min. Fluorescence was recorded at excitation wavelengths of 490/440 nm, and fluorescence ratios were calibrated using the nigericin-high K+ clamp as before. [Cl–]i was measured with MQAE as before (18Choi J.Y. Muallem D. Kiselyov K. Lee M.G. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nature. 2001; 410: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The cells were loaded by incubation with 5 mm MQAE for 1 h at room temperature. MQAE fluorescence was recorded at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm while the cells were perfused with solutions containing 150 mm Cl– or 150 mmNO3−. Electrophysiology—The whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique was used to measure the Cl– current in control and SLC26A7-transfected HEK293 cells as detailed before (19Zeng W. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32956-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The pipette solution contained (mm) 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 1 MgCl2, 2 EGTA, 5 ATP, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3 with Tris), and the bath solution was Na+-free solution A. The current was recorded using an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier and digitized at 2 kHz. The membrane conductance was probed by stepping the membrane potential from a holding potential of 0 mV to membrane potentials between –100 and +60 mV at 10-mV steps for 200 ms with 500-ms intervals between steps. Pipettes had resistance between 5 and 7 megohms when filled with an intracellular solution, and seal resistance was always more than 8 gigohms. Current recording and analysis were performed with the pClamp 6.0.3 software. For current recording in oocytes the oocytes were obtained by partial ovariectomy of anesthetized female Xenopus laevis. Follicles were removed and defolliculated as detailed before (6Ko S.B.H. Shcheynikov N. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Ishibashi K. Thomas P.J. Kim J.Y. Lee M.G. Naruse S. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5562-5572Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Healthy oocytes in stage V to VI were injected with 10–25 ng of cRNA in a final volume of 50 nl. Injected oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in an ND-96 solution composed of (in mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 2.5 pyruvate, 5 HEPES-Na, pH 7.5, and oocytes were used 48–96 h post-injection. Na+-free media were prepared by replacing Na+ with N-methyl-d-glucamine, and Cl–-free media were prepared by replacing Cl– with gluconate. To prepare solutions containing Br–, I–, or NO3− NaCl and KCl were replaced with the relevant salt that was supplemented with 1.8 mm Ca2+-cyclamate, 1 MgSO4, 2.5 pyruvic acid, 5 HEPES, pH 7.5, with Tris. A two-electrode voltage clamp setup was used to record the current as detailed before (6Ko S.B.H. Shcheynikov N. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Ishibashi K. Thomas P.J. Kim J.Y. Lee M.G. Naruse S. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5562-5572Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Current and voltage were digitized with a Digidata 1322A A/D converter and analyzed by the Clampex 8.1 system. The pHi of oocytes was measured with single-barreled borosilicate-silanized microelectrodes as described before (20Shcheynikov N. Kim K.H. Kim K.-M. Dorwart M.R. Ko S.B.H. Goto H. Naruse S. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21857-21865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In brief, ∼0.5 μl of proton exchanger resin was introduced into the tip of the microelectrodes, and the electrodes were backfilled with an ND-96 solution and calibrated in standard solutions of pH 6, 7, and 8 before and after each experiment. The electrodes were fitted with a holder with an Ag-AgCl wire attached to a high impedance probe of a two-channel FD-223 electrometer. A second channel was used for measurement of membrane potential using a standard microelectrode. The bath was grounded via a 3 m KCl agar bridge connected to an Ag-AgCl wire. The signal from the voltage microelectrode was subtracted from the voltage of the pH electrode to obtain the pHi changes. Initial rates of change in pHi were determined from the slope of the line obtained by fitting pHi versus time to a linear regression line. The slope of the pH electrodes was between 56 and 57 mV (pH unit)–1. For measurement of pHi under voltage clamp conditions, a three-electrode setup was used. Two standard microelectrodes connected to an OC-725C amplifier were used for voltage and current clamps, and one electrode containing the pH resin was attached to a FD-223 electrometer. A common reference electrode was used for both amplifiers. Data were acquired as described above for pHi measurement. Statistical Analysis—Results in all experiments are given as the mean ± S.E. of the indicated number of experiments. The results of multiple experiments were analyzed using analysis of variance or by paired or non-paired Student's t test as appropriate. SLC26A7 Is an Electrogenic Transporter—Two recent studies expressed SLC26A7 in Xenopus oocytes and measured pHi to conclude that SLC26A7 is a cell shrinkage-activated Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (15Petrovic S. Ju X. Barone S. Seidler U. Alper S.L. Lohi H. Kere J. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G1093-G1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Petrovic S. Barone S. Xu J. Conforti L. Ma L. Kujala M. Kere J. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F161-F169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether SLC26A7 is an electrogenic transporter the protein was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and the resulting current was measured in Cl–-containing and Cl–-free media. Fig. 1A displays the nearly linear I/V curves recorded from control oocytes and oocytes expressing SLC26A7. Expression of SLC26A7 generated a current that at +60 mV averaged 2.7 ± 0.3 μA (n = 18). Removal of external Cl– reduced the outward current at +60 mV to 1.1 ± 0.2 μA. To further characterize the current mediated by SLC26A7, Fig. 1B shows that the instantaneous inward and outward currents are time- and voltage-independent, similar to the properties of the current mediated by CFTR (21Dawson D.C. Smith S.S. Mansoura M.K. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 47-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The ion selectivity of SLC26A7 was measured by ion substitution. Replacing external Na+ or K+ with N-methyl-d-glucamine had no effect on the current, indicating that SLC26A7 does not conduct these ions (data not shown). Measurement of reversal potentials (RP) as in Fig. 1C showed that SLC26A7 has a similar low permeability to gluconate and SO42−, identical permeability to Cl– and Br– and very high permeability to NO3− (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, I– showed anomalous behavior. Replacing external Cl– with I– had no effect on the reversal potential, but reduced both the inward and outward currents. Because the inward current is mediated by Cl– efflux, I– is an inhibitor of Cl– transport by SLC26A7. Therefore, the anionic selectivity of SLC26A7 is NO3−>Cl−=Br−>Glu, and is similar to that reported for CFTR (21Dawson D.C. Smith S.S. Mansoura M.K. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 47-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), including the anomalous effect of I– (22Tabcharani J.A. Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. J. Gen Physiol. 1997; 110: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Regulation of SLC26A7 Selectivity by pHi—As a first test of HCO3− transport by SLC26A7 we recorded the effect of HCO3− on the Cl– current. The current was recorded 5–7 min after the exposure to CO2/HCO3− to allow completion of cellular acidification. The CO2/HCO3− acidifies the oocytes because of the rapid diffusion of CO2 into the cell and its hydration in the cytosol. In all experiments (n = 14) HCO3− had no effect on the current recorded in the presence of Cl– (Fig. 2A). However, HCO3− noticeably shifted the reversal potential in Cl–-free media from +2.75 ± 1.1 mV (n = 32) in HEPES-buffered media to +19.5 ± 1.4 mV (n = 14) in HCO3− media (Fig. 2C). The effect of HCO3− can be mediated by HCO3− itself or by the reduction in pHi caused by exposing the oocytes to a HCO3−- buffered media equilibrated with CO2. To distinguish between the two possibilities we measured the effect of butyrate on pHi (see Fig. 3) and the I/V in Cl–-containing and Cl–-free media. Butyrate acidified pHi similar to HCO3−. Fig. 2, B and C, show that butyrate had the same effect as HCO3− by having no effect on the current in Cl–-containing media and shifting the RP in Cl–-free media to +21.9 ± 3.4 mV (n = 8). The pHi dependence of the shift in RP is shown in Fig. 2D. In preliminary experiments we found that the most reliable data could be obtained by acidifying the oocytes with 40 mm butyrate and then reducing the butyrate concentration stepwise from 40 to 30, 20, 10 and 5 mm. Reducing pHi from a resting level of 7.35 ± 0.02 (n = 3, H+ concentration of 44.7 nm) to 6.93 ± 0.02 (n = 3, H+ concentration of 117 nm) was sufficient to cause the maximum shift in RP. Therefore, the findings in Fig. 2 indicate that pHi regulates SLC26A7 channel selectivity. Acidic pH (increased intracellular H+ or reduced OH– ions) increases the selectivity of SLC26A7 for Cl–. To our knowledge SLC26A7 is the first Cl– channel the selectivity of which is regulated by intracellular acidification.Fig. 3Lack of HCO3− transport by SLC26A7. Oocytes were used to measure the membrane potential and pHi. A, control oocytes (gray traces) and oocytes expressing SLC26A7 (black traces) in HEPES-buffered media were exposed to Cl–-free media that hyperpolarized control and depolarized oocytes expressing SLC26A7. Then the oocytes were incubated in HCO3− media, and where indicated the oocytes were incubated in Cl–-free, HCO3− media. The shaded area marks the period of incubation in Cl–-free medium. Finally, Cl– was added back to the perfusate, and then HCO3− was removed by perfusing the oocytes in HEPES-buffered media. A similar protocol was used in B except that the oocytes were incubated in media containing 40 mm butyrate (Buty) instead of HCO3−.

In Fig. 3A the effect of removal and addition of Cl– on membrane potential and pHi was measured in the presence and absence of HCO3−. Removal of Cl– in both HEPES- and HCO3−-buffered media depolarized the cells. However, in the absence of HCO3− removal of Cl– depolarized the cells by 17 ± 1 mV, whereas in the presence of HCO3− removal of Cl– depolarized the cells by 50 ± 2.5 mV (n = 14) (Fig. 3D), consistent with the increased selectivity to Cl– in HCO3− media shown in Fig. 2. The same pattern of depolarization was observed in oocytes incubated with butyrate (Fig. 3B) when removal of Cl– in the absence of butyrate depolarized the oocytes by 16 ± 1.3 and in the presence of butyrate by 52 ± 1.3 mV (n = 8) (Fig. 3D). Surprisingly, SLC26A7 showed minimal OH– or HCO3− transport. Thus, removal of external Cl– in the presence or absence of HCO3− or butyrate resulted in a very slow rate of alkalinization (Fig. 3, A and B). In fact, in the presence of HCO3− the rate of alkalinization before and after removal of Cl– in oocytes expressing SLC26A7 was the same and was less than 0.01 ΔpH/min (Fig. 3C). A small difference was found when the rate of alkalinization was compared between control oocytes and oocytes expressing SLC26A7 (control, 0.0029 ± 0.0005, n = 7; SLC26A7 0.0074 ± 0.0008 ΔpH/min, n = 14, p < 0.05). Previous work used medium buffered with 33 mmHCO3−. We repeated the experiments in Fig. 3 in media buffered with 33 mm (n = 7) and 50 mm (n = 5) HCO3−. Increasing HCO3− did not change the findings of large depolarization and no HCO3− influx upon incubation of the oocytes in Cl–-free media. The results in Fig. 3 suggest that SLC26A7 may have a finite permeability to HCO3− and perhaps OH–. To verify this possibility and explore the role of Cl– in OH– transport we measured the effect of increasing pHo on pHi in the presence and absence of external Cl–. The upper trace in Fig. 4A is the control. The lower trace in Fig. 4A shows that in oocytes expressing SLC26A7 increasing pHo from 7.5 to 8.5 and 9.0 increased pHi accordingly. Importantly, restoring pHo to 7.5 resulted in recovery of pHi, and the increase and recovery of pHi in response to changes in pHo were minimally affected by removal of external Cl–. To test whether SLC26A7 OH– permeability is conductive we measured the effect of the membrane potential on pHi. The experiments were done in HEPES-buffered media because at the acidic pHi in HCO3−-buffered media changes in membrane potential had minimal effect on pHi (data not shown). The darkly shaded areas in Fig. 4B show that at constant Cl–o and pHo, clamping the membrane potential at –80 mV acidified the cytosol by 0.07 ± 0.01 pH units, whereas clamping the membrane potential at +40 mV alkalinized the cytosol by 0.22 ± 0.03 pH units (n = 4). Hence, the transport of OH– by SLC26A7 is purely conductive. The combined results in Figs. 3 and 4 show that SLC26A7 has a very low permeability to OH– and HCO3−, leading us to conclude that SLC26A7 is not a HCO3− transporter but rather is a Cl– channel that poorly conducts OH– and HCO3−. Sensitivity to Blockers—Common blockers used to probe anion transporters are DIDS, DPC, and glybenclamide (Glyb). The effect of these blockers on the SLC26A7 current is depicted in Fig. 5. Fig. 5, A and B, shows the complex inhibition by DIDS. In HEPES-buffered media the inhibition saturated at 100 μm DIDS but was partial. Increasing DIDS to 500 μm did not change the extent of the inhibition, which plateaued at 56 ± 8% (n = 5). HCO3− increased the apparent affinity to DIDS from about 17 ± 4 to 7.1 ± 2.3 μm and the maximal inhibition to 74 ± 13% (n = 5) (Fig. 5B). This finding further indicates that pHi and HCO3− modify the properties of SLC26A7 as was found in Fig. 2 for the selectivity to Cl–. DPC also inhibited the current mediated by SLC26A7 (Fig. 5C) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5E), with 78 ± 14% (n = 3) inhibition at 0.5 mm DPC. Finally, SLC26A7 current was inhibited by Glyb (Fig. 5D) with 65 ± 9% (n = 3) inhibition by 0.5 mm Glyb. The inhibitor profile found for the current mediated by SLC26A7 emphasizes the need to interpret such studies with much caution because these blockers were shown to inhibit other Cl– transporters. Of particular interest is the inhibition by Glyb. Often, inhibition of a Cl– current by Glyb is taken as evidence that the current is mediated by CFTR. Inhibition of the SLC26A7 current by Glyb indicates that inhibition by Glyb cannot be taken as evidence of current mediation by CFTR. Properties of SLC26A7 Expressed in HEK293 Cells—The difference between the current work leading to the conclusion that SLC26A7 is a pHi-regulated Cl– channel and that reported before concluding that SLC26A7 is a coupled Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (15Petrovic S. Ju X. Barone S. Seidler U. Alper S.L. Lohi H. Kere J. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G1093-G1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Petrovic S. Barone S. Xu J. Conforti L. Ma L. Kujala M. Kere J. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F161-F169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) raises the possibility that expression in oocytes may lead to activation of differential endogenous transporters that result in the different findings. It was therefore important to express the mammalian clone in a mammalian cell and examine its transport properties. HEK293 cells are suitable for such studies because they have low endogenous Cl–/OH– exchange activity (Fig. 6A). Expression of SLC26A7 in HEK293 cells and incubation of the cells in HEPES- or HCO3−-buffered, Cl–-free media resulted in an increase in pHi as if SLC26A7 mediates Cl–/OH– and Cl−/HCO3− exchange, respectively (Fig. 6B). However, this is not the case because in HEPES-buffered media the increase in pHi was transient, spontaneously returning to basal level (n > 20). In addition, the effect of removing external Cl– on pHi was blocked by depolarizing the cells with 40 mm external K+ (Fig. 6C). Although the increase in pHi due to Cl– removal of cells incubated in HCO3−-buffered media was more stable, it was also reduced by cell depolarization (Fig. 6D). All the pHi changes recorded under the conditions of Fig. 6 were inhibited by about 60–75% by 0.25 mm DIDS (data not shown). Two assays were used to show that SLC26A7 expressed in HEK293 cells functions as a Cl– channel. First, we measured [Cl–]i with MQAE and followed the rate of Cl−/NO3− exchange as was used before to assay CFTR channel activity (6Ko S.B.H. Shcheynikov N. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Ishibashi K. Thomas P.J. Kim J.Y. Lee M.G. Naruse S. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5562-5572Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 18Choi J.Y. Muallem D. Kiselyov K. Lee M.G. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nature. 2001; 410: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Fig. 6E is the control, and Fig. 6F shows the high rate of Cl−/NO3− exchange mediated by SLC26A7. Importantly, the SLC26A7-mediated Cl−/NO3− exchange was inhibited 78 ± 6% (n = 3) by depolarizing the cells with 40 mm external K+. The SLC26A7-mediated Cl−/NO3− exchange was inhibited by preincubation of the cells with 0.25 mm DIDS (Fig. 6G). In the second assay we characterized the current generated by expressing SLC26A7 in HEK293 cells. Fig. 7A shows that expression of SLC26A7 in HEK293 cells resulted in a large Cl– current that averaged 673 ± 114 pA (n = 5). In symmetrical Cl– concentrations the current followed linear I/V with reversal potential of 2 ± 3 mV. As was found in oocytes (Fig. 1), the instantaneous current in HEK293 cells was time- and voltage-independent (Fig. 7, B and C). Interestingly, at 150 mm intracellular Cl– the current in HEK293 cells maintained in HEPES-buffered media was highly Cl– selective, as evident from the shift in the reversal potential to 58 ± 5 mV (n = 5) and the a lack of outward current in Cl–-free medium (Fig. 7A). The lack of outward current made it difficult to demonstrate the effect of pHi on SLC26A7 selectivity in HEK293 cells. Therefore, we measured the SLC26A7-mediated current in cells infused with the more physiological Cl– concentration of 30 mm. Fig. 7, D and E, show that the RP of the SLC26A7 current in HEK293 cells infused with a pipette solution containing 30 mm Cl–, pH of 7.5, and incubated in Cl–-free media is about 43 ± 3 mV. Exposing these cells to HCO3−-buffered media for 1 min, a time sufficient for completion of the acidification and before substantial recovery of pHi (Fig. 6), shifted the RP to 57 ± 2 mV. When the cells were infused with a pipette solution buffered with HEPES to a pH of 6.5, the RP was 65 ± 3.5 mV, and exposing these cells to a HCO3−-buffered media had no further effect on the RP, which averaged 53 ± 4.4 mV. These findings indicate that in HEK293 cells SLC26A7 Cl– channel activity is also regulated by pHi and that HCO3− likely does not regulate the channel independent of pHi because it did not affect the SLC26A7 current in cells maintained at a pHi of 6.5. In conclusion, measurement of membrane current and voltage and pHi in Xenopus oocytes and HEK293 cells expressing SLC26A7 reveal that SLC26A7 functions as a Cl– channel that is regulated by pHi. Several protocols were used to evaluate OH−/HCO3− transport by SLC26A7, and all reported very low permeability. In fact, OH−/HCO3− transport was found only when pHi was above 7 in either oocytes (Fig. 4) or HEK293 cells (Fig. 6). Even under these conditions the OH−/HCO3− permeability was conductive as evident from the effect of the membrane potential on pHi and inhibition of the pHi changes by membrane depolarization (Figs. 4 and 6). We, therefore, have to conclude that SLC26A7 does not function as a Cl−/HCO3− exchanger as suggested before (15Petrovic S. Ju X. Barone S. Seidler U. Alper S.L. Lohi H. Kere J. Soleimani M. Am. J.

Physiol. 2004; 286: F161-F169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but rather as a pHi-regulated Cl– channel. We have no immediate explanation for the difference between our findings and those reported before, although expression in Xenopus oocytes sometimes leads to activation of native transporters. Previous work did not measure membrane current or the behavior of SLC26A7 in HEK293 cells. Such measurements may clarify the disparity between the findings. The finding that SLC26A7 functions as a channel highlights the remarkable diverse functions and substrate selectivity of the members of the SLC26 transporters family. For example, SLC26A3 (DRA), SLC26A4 (Pendrin), and SLC26A6 function as Cl−/HCO3− exchangers (6Ko S.B.H. Shcheynikov N. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Ishibashi K. Thomas P.J. Kim J.Y. Lee M.G. Naruse S. Muallem S.

Although all transporters examined so far function as electrogenic transporters, SLC26A3 may function as a 2Cl−/HCO3− exchanger, SLC26A6 as a 2HCO3−/Cl− exchanger, and SLC26A7 as a Cl– channel with limited HCO3− permeability that is modulated by pHi. A comparative structure-function study of representative members of the family with diverse transport modes should be very informative. SLC26A7 is expressed in the basolateral membrane of the acid-secreting cells in the cortical collecting duct and the gastric parietal cells. How might a pHi-modulated Cl– channel function in such cells? A clue may be suggested by the behavior of SLC26A7 as a selective Cl– channel at acidic pHi (Fig. 2) and the reduced Cl– selectivity and increased OH−/HCO3− permeability at a pHi above 7 (Figs. 4 and 6). It is possible that at rest SLC26A7 functions as a selective Cl– channel. Stimulation of acid secretion leads to an increase in pHi of the parietal cell (25Muallem S. Blissard D. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14703-14711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This will result in an increased OH−/HCO3− permeability of SLC26A7 that may provide a pathway to clear the excess base equivalents while allowing Cl– entry into the cells that is needed for acid secretion. The same mechanism may function at the cortical collecting duct. Although the net effect is Cl−/HCO3− exchange, the regulation of SLC26A7 by pHi may function as a sensor to activate the exchange only at the time of acid secretion. It remains to be discovered why a channel is preferable to an exchanger in fulfilling this function. However, it is worth noting that the Cl– exit pathway at the apical membrane is a Cl– channel (26Hersey S.J. Sachs G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 155-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A Cl– entry pathway at the basolateral membrane will allow for electrical coupling between the Cl– exit and Cl– entry pathways during stimulated acid secretion."

To understand the structural and dynamic basis for this autoinhibition, we have used NMR spectroscopy to characterize Ets-1ΔN301, a partially inhibited fragment of Ets-1. The NMR-derived Ets-1ΔN301 structure reveals that the autoinhibitory module is formed predominantly by the hydrophobic packing of helices from the N-terminal (HI-1, HI-2) and C-terminal (H4, H5) inhibitory sequences, along with H1 of the intervening DNA binding ETS domain. The intramolecular interactions made by HI-1 in Ets-1ΔN301 are similar to the intermolecular contacts observed in the crystal structure of an Ets-1ΔN300 dimer, confirming that the latter represents a domain-swapped species. 15N relaxation studies demonstrate that the backbone of the N-terminal inhibitory sequence is mobile on the nanosecond-picosecond and millisecond-microsecond time scales. Furthermore, hydrogen exchange measurements reveal that amide protons in helices HI-1 and HI-2 exchange with water at rates only ∼15- and ∼75-fold slower, respectively, than predicted for an unfolded polypeptide. These findings indicate that inhibitory helices are only marginally stable even in the absence of DNA.

Ets-1 autoinhibition illustrates how conformational equilibria within structural domains can regulate macromolecular interactions. Gene expression can be controlled by modulating the DNA binding affinity of sequence specific transcription factors. Similar to several other transcription factors, the DNA binding of Ets-1 is modulated by an autoinhibitory module that provides a route to biological regulation (1Pufall M.A. Graves B.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 421-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).

When these sequences are deleted, as in an alternatively spliced isoform of Ets-1, or when their structural elements are disrupted by mutations, as in the case of the oncogenic v-Ets, the affinity of Ets-1 for its target DNA sites is enhanced by 10- to 20-fold (4Hagman J.

In a cellular context, this module is essential for response to different regulatory signals. DNA binding of Ets-1 is enhanced 10- to 20-fold through a partnership with the transcription factor RUNX1 (CBFα2/AML1) (7Goetz T.L. Gu T.-L. Speck N.A. Graves B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Conversely, in activated T-cells, phosphorylation of a serine-rich region (residues 244–300) inhibits the DNA binding of Ets-1 by another ∼50-fold (8Cowley D.O. Graves B.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 366-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, these two effects require an intact inhibitory module. Mechanistic insight into autoinhibition has come from the observation that the Ets-1 inhibitory module changes conformation upon binding to DNA. Initial secondary structural studies performed in our laboratories demonstrated that this module is composed of four coupled α-helices, located N-terminal (HI-1, HI-2) and C-terminal (H4, H5) to the ETS domain (Fig. 1A). Chemical shift data from NMR spectra comparing an inhibited fragment, Ets-1ΔN280, 2Ets-1 fragments are indicated by the boundaries of truncations from the N terminus of the protein, e.g. Ets-1ΔN301 is a deletion of residues 1–300 and corresponds to Ets-1(301–440). to one missing the N-terminal inhibitory sequences, Ets-1ΔN331, mapped the contacts of HI-1 and HI-2 to the first helix of the ETS domain (H1) and to the C-terminal inhibitory region near H4 and H5 (9Skalicky J.J.

This implicated helix H1 in the autoinhibitory mechanism due to its role in both directly contacting DNA and in packing of the inhibitory helices (11Wang H. McIntosh L.P. Graves B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Importantly, these contacts also lie on a contiguous surface of the protein opposite the DNA recognition helix (H3), indicating that autoinhibition does not result from a simple steric blockage of DNA binding. Instead, limited proteolysis and CD spectroscopic studies revealed that HI-1 unfolds upon complex formation with DNA (2Petersen J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. McIntosh L.P. Alber T. Graves B.J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Together, these data led to the proposal that autoinhibition results from the allosteric coupling of a helix-coil transition with DNA binding, and that the affinity of Ets-1 for DNA is inversely correlated with the stability of the inhibitory module. X-ray crystallographic studies have extended the framework for understanding the autoinhibition phenomenon. A crystal structure of Ets-1ΔN280 in complex with DNA demonstrated that helix HI-1 is disordered, whereas HI-2, H4, and H5 are coupled and contact the core ETS domain via H1 (12Garvie C.W.

The crystal structure of a second, partially inhibited fragment, Ets-1ΔN300, solved in the absence of DNA, showed a conformation similar to bound Ets-1ΔN280, but with a folded HI-1 (12Garvie C.W.

This dimeric state was not expected, and indeed, subsequent mutagenic analyses suggested that the in trans position of HI-1 in this crystal approximated its in cis position in the monomeric protein in solution. Thus, Ets-1ΔN300 appeared to crystallize as a three-dimensional domain-swapped dimer (13Liu Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Science. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Both of these structures also displayed features of the ETS domain-DNA interface similar to those observed in several investigations of related Ets proteins (14Kodandapani R. Pio F. Ni C.-Z.

Although these extensive structural and functional studies have laid a foundation for understanding the mechanism of autoinhibition, several key questions remained unanswered. What is the structure of the inhibitory module in the unbound state of the native Ets-1 monomer? What are the features of HI-1 that allow a facile helix-coil transition, and does this transition occur even in the absence of DNA? Finally, what couples DNA binding to the inhibitory action of helices that lie distant from the recognition helix of the ETS domain? To address these questions, we have studied the partially-inhibited Ets-1ΔN301 in its DNA-free form using NMR spectroscopy. Our findings yielded the first high-resolution structure of a monomeric Ets-1 fragment that displays the intramolecular packing of all inhibitory helices. In parallel, backbone amide 15N relaxation and hydrogen exchange data for Ets-1ΔN301 demonstrate that HI-1 is only marginally stable and thus poised to unfold. Additional regions of this protein, including the DNA binding interface, also display conformational mobility suggestive of a role in the allosteric mechanism of autoinhibition. Sample Preparation—The gene encoding Ets-1ΔN301 (residues 301–440 of murine Ets-1) was constructed by ligation of a PCR-amplified NdeI/EcoRI fragment of the wild-type ets-1 gene (corresponding to residues 301–352) with an EcoRI/HindIII fragment of a synthetic, codon-biased ets-1 gene into pET22b (Invitrogen). The final Ets-1ΔN301 construct encoded an additional Met and Gly at its N terminus, and unless stated otherwise, a surface C416S substitution to help limit oxidative cross-linking. This mutation causes minimal NMR spectral, and by inference, structural perturbations (data not shown). Ets-1ΔN301 was purified as described previously (2Petersen J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W.

Neri D. Leiting B. Otting G. Wu ̈thrich K. J. Biolmol. NMR. 1992; 2: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Ets-1ΔN301, selectively labeled with ring-deuterated aromatic amino acid residues, was prepared in synthetic rich medium containing two of (2H5-γ1,2,δ1,2,ζ)-Phe, (2H4-γ1,2,δ1,2)-Tyr, or (2H5-δ1,ζ1,ζ2,ϵ3,η2)-Trp (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) (22McIntosh L.P. Dahlquist F.W. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A similar approach was used to selectively label Ets-1ΔN301 with 13Cβ-Ala. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing of purified Ets-1ΔN301 confirmed that the N-terminal Met was absent. NMR Spectral Assignments—NMR experiments were performed on Varian Unity 500 MHz, Inova 600 MHz, and Inova 800 MHz spectrometers. Spectra were acquired at 28 °C with protein concentrations ranging from 0.3–0.8 mm in an NMR sample buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% NaN3, and ∼10% D2O. The high ionic strength was critical for protein solubility. Spectral processing and analysis were performed using Felix 2000 (Accelrys, Inc.), NMRPipe (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11620) Google Scholar), and Sparky (24.Goddard, T. D., and Kneeler, D. G. (1999) Sparky 3rd Ed., San Francisco, CAGoogle Scholar). Assignments of the Ets-1ΔN301 backbone and side chain 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances were obtained using an extensive set of multidimensional NMR experiments (25Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Progr. NMR Spectros. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1396) Google Scholar) acquired on protein samples uniformly 15N-, 15N/13C-, or 2H/15N/13C-labeled, as well as selectively labeled with 13Cβ-Ala or with ring-deuterated Tyr, Phe, or Trp. Full assignments of only nine residues, located within the HI-1/HI-2 loop (Lys318, Pro319, Ile321, Pro322), HI-2 (Ala323, Thr330), H3 (Tyr397, Asp398), and between H3 and S3 (Lys399) were not obtained because of exchange broadening and/or spectral overlap. Stereochemical assignments of the signals from non-degenerate β-methylene protons (37 of 104 possible) were based upon HNHB and short mixing time 15N-TOCSY-HSQC (τm = 38 ms) experiments, while those of side chain Gln and Asn amide protons (7 of 8 pairs) were obtained from an EZ-HMQC-NH2 spectrum (26McIntosh L.P. Brun E. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Complete stereochemical assignments of the Val and Leu methyl group resonances were determined from a constant time 1H-13C HSQC spectrum acquired on a non-randomly 10% 13C-labeled sample (21Szyperski T. Neri D. Leiting B. Otting G. Wu ̈thrich K. J. Biolmol. NMR. 1992; 2: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—Structural calculations were performed using ARIA/CNS version 1.2 with torsional angle dynamics (27Bru ̈nger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

NOE restraints were determined from a 1H-15N-1H NOESY-HSQC (τm = 100 ms) recorded on 15N-labeled Ets-1ΔN301; a 15N-15N-1H NOESY-HSQC (τm = 200 ms) recorded on 2H/13C/15N-labeled Ets-1ΔN301; and a simultaneous 1H-15N/13C-1H NOESY-HSQC (τm = 100 ms) focused on aliphatic side chains, a 1H-13C-1H NOESY-HSQC (τm = 100 ms) for aromatic side chains, and a simultaneous constant time methyl 13C-13C/15N-1H NOESY (τm = 140 ms), all recorded on a uniformly 13C/15N-labeled protein sample in H2O buffer (29Zwahlen C. Gardner K.H. Sarma S.P. Horita D.A. Byrd R.A. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 7617-7625Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Most NOE cross-peaks were manually picked and assigned prior to intensity calibration in ARIA. Backbone dihedral angles were determined from Cα, Cβ, C′, Hα, and HN chemical shifts using TALOS (30Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). The χ1 side chain dihedral angles for residues with β-methylene protons were determined from a conservative examination of short mixing time 15N TOCSY-HSQC (τm = 38 ms) and HNHB spectra, according to a staggered rotomer model. Side chain χ1 dihedral angles for Ile, Val, and Thr residues were derived on the basis of 3JNCγ and 3JC'Cγ coupling constants measured from 13C-{15N} and 13C-{13C′} spin echo difference CT-HSQC spectra (31Vuister G.W. Wang A.C. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 5334-5335Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). All Xaa-Pro amides were constrained to the trans conformation, based upon their proline 13Cα chemical shifts (32Schubert M. Labudde D. Oschkinat H. Schmieder P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), as well as the absence of (Xaa)Hα-(Pro)Hα interactions in NOESY spectra. The charge states of the His imidazoles were not experimentally determined and thus were set to the default fully protonated form. A limited set of hydrogen bond restraints were included for amides located in helices or strands, as determined via NOE and chemical shift information and protection from hydrogen-deuterium exchange. Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were acquired on a uniformly 15N-labeled protein sample diffused into a 5% acrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide stock) (33Ishii Y. Markus M.A. Tycko R. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The gel was cast at a 6 mm diameter and ∼20 mm length, dialyzed against NMR sample buffer, and soaked in a solution containing labeled protein overnight, giving a calculated final Ets-1ΔN301 concentration of ∼0.1–0.2 mm. Prior to spectral acquisition, the pellets were loaded into a 5-mm silanized bottomless NMR tube using a gel stretching apparatus (34Chou J.J. Gaemers S. Howder B. Louis J.M. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) purchased from New Era Enterprises, Inc. The gel stretched ∼2.1 times its original length, yielding splittings of ∼5 Hz in a 2H-NMR spectrum of the 1HO2H lock solvent. Backbone 1H-15N RDCs were measured from the 1H-15N-IPAP-HSQC spectrum (35Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) of the partially aligned protein, relative to that of a reference spectrum recorded for unaligned Ets-1ΔN301. 49 RDC restraints, ranging from -17.8 to +11.5 Hz for amides in the helical and β-sheet regions of Ets-1ΔN301 with well resolved NMR signals, were used for the structural calculations. Axial and rhombic parameters were estimated using a histogram method, followed by a grid search to determine the optimal values of Da (-8.9 Hz) and R (0.3) resulting in minimal SANI violations during the final energy minimization step of ARIA/CNS (36Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Bax A. J. Mag. Res. 1998; 133: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The Ets-1ΔN301 structure ensemble was calculated using a two-step ARIA protocol. An initial round of ARIA (it0 → it8), starting with an unfolded polypeptide, was completed with only dihedral angle and hydrogen bond restraints and uncalibrated NOE data. A second full ARIA calculation (it1 → it8) followed, with RDC restraints included, using the prefolded structures and the unambiguous and ambiguous NOE restraint sets from the previous round as the starting parameters. A total of 50 structures were calculated per iteration during each round, of which the energetically top 25 from the final iteration were further refined in a water box using Lennard-Jones potentials. The ARIA-derived unambiguous and ambiguous NOE distance restraints were evaluated using VMD-Xplor (37Schweiters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Mag. Res. 2001; 149: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Analyses of the structures were performed using MolMol (38Koradi R. Billeter M. Wu ̈thrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6496) Google Scholar), InsightII (Accelrys, Inc.), and Procheck-NMR (39Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4466) Google Scholar). Secondary structure boundaries for the ensemble were defined according to Promotif (40Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar) and Vadar (41Willard L. Ranjan A. Zhang H. Monzavi H. Boyko R.F. Sykes B.D. Wishart D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3316-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). NMR Relaxation Measurements—Amide 15N relaxation parameters for 15N-labeled Ets-1ΔN301 were acquired on a 500 MHz spectrometer at 28 °C using water-selective pulse sequences (42Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2017) Google Scholar). Data points for the T1 (11, 56, 122, 200, 333, 522, 788, and 1066 ms) and T2 (17, 33, 50, 67, 84, 100, 117, and 150 ms) experiments were collected in random order with one duplicate each to facilitate error analysis. Steady-state heteronuclear 1H{15N}-NOE spectra were acquired with and without 3 s of 1H saturation and a total recycle delay of 5 s. Relaxation rates and extended anisotropic Lipari-Szabo model-free relaxation parameters (43Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4558Crossref Scopus (3402) Google Scholar, 44Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar, 45Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) were calculated using Curvefit (46Palmer III, A.G. CurveFit 1.22 Ed. Columbia University, New York1998Google Scholar) and Tensor2 (47Dosset P. Hus J.-C. Blackledge M. Marion D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), respectively. Based on the average minimized structure, the global motions of Ets-1ΔN301 were fit to a fully anisotropic diffusion tensor with DZZ = 1.82 (± 0.04) × 107 s-1, DYY = 1.67 (± 0.03) × 107 s-1, and DXX = 1.65 (± 0.04) × 107 s-1; this approximates a slightly prolate ellipsoid with D∥/D⊥ ∼1.1 ± 0.05. The resulting model-free parameters are tabulated in Supplemental Table SI. Amide 15N relaxation-dispersion parameters for Ets-1ΔN301 were acquired with relaxation-compensated 1H-15N CPMG-HSQC experiments recorded using 600 MHz and 800 MHz NMR spectrometers (48Mulder F.A.A. Skrynnikov N.R. Hon B. Dahlquist F.W. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The constant time CPMG-T2 delays were set to 40 msec, whereas spectra corresponding to the effective B1 fields, νCPMG (600 MHz: 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 Hz; 800 MHz: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 Hz), were collected in random order with three duplicate data points. Relaxation-dispersion parameters were calculated from a fit of R2effversus νCPMG using a Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc.) module provided by O. Millet (49Millet O. Loria J.P. Kroenke C.D. Pons M. Palmer A.G.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2867-2877Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Amide Hydrogen Exchange—Slow amide proton-deuterium exchange rates (28 °C, pH* 6.5) were measured from a series of sensitivity-enhanced 1H-15N HSQC spectra recorded after rapid transfer of wild type 15N-labeled Ets-1ΔN301 through a Sephadex G-25 spin column equilibrated with NMR sample buffer prepared in 99% D2O (50Connelly G.P. McIntosh L.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1810-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The first spectrum, started ∼8 min. after transfer, was acquired in 11 min, while subsequent spectra were recorded with increasing numbers of transients per t1 increment for improved signal-to-noise. After scaling according to the number of transients, pseudo-first order rate constants for exchange, kex, were obtained by least squares fitting of peak intensity, It, versus the mid-point time of each spectrum to the equation It = Ioexp(-kext) + I∞, where I∞ accounts for the effect of residual protonated water (∼5%). Rapid amide proton-proton exchange rates at 28 °C and pH 6.86 to 8.25 were determined for wild-type 15N-labeled Ets-1ΔN301 by the CLEANEX-PM method (51Hwang T.-L. van Zijl P.C.M. Mori S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) using a series of 6 spectra with transfer periods ranging from 10 to 60 msec. Each spectrum was recorded in ∼5 h using a recycle delay of 2.05 s. Reference spectra were recorded in ∼5 h using a recycle delay of 12.1 s to ensure complete relaxation. For improved signal-to-noise, duplicated data sets were measured and merged at both pH 7.50 and 7.74. Pseudo-first order rate constants for chemical exchange, kex, were obtained by least squares fitting of peak intensities to published equations (51Hwang T.-L. van Zijl P.C.M. Mori S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), using a Matlab module provided by W.-Y. Choy (University of Toronto) and assuming a negligible contribution from water relaxation. Predicted exchange rates, kpred, for an unstructured polypeptide with the sequence of Ets-1ΔN301 were calculated with the program Sphere (52.Zhang, Y.-Z. (1995) Protein and Peptide Structure and Interactions Studied by Hydrogen Exchange and NMR. Ph.D. thesis, University of Pennsylvania, PhiladelphiaGoogle Scholar) using poly-dl-alanine reference data corrected for amino acid type, pH, temperature, and isotope effects (53Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar, 54Connelly G.P. Bai Y. Jeng M.F. Englander S.W.

Spectral Assignments of Ets-1ΔN301—This NMR study was performed on Ets-1ΔN301, a truncation fragment of Ets-1 spanning residue 301 to its native C terminus. The affinity of Ets-1ΔN301 for a consensus DNA sequence is ∼2-fold inhibited relative to Ets-1ΔN331, the fully de-repressed fragment lacking the entire N-terminal inhibitory sequence, as compared with ∼10-fold for both Ets-1ΔN280 and full-length Ets-1 (data not shown). Thus, although retaining all of the inhibitory helices (Fig. 1A), Ets-1ΔN301 is only partially-inhibited due to the absence of residues 280–300. While essential for full repression (2Petersen J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. McIntosh L.P. Alber T. Graves B.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), these residues are conformationally disordered (9Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. Petersen J.M. Graves B.J. McIntosh L.P. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 296-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and their deletion substantially improved the amenability of the resulting Ets-1ΔN301 toward detailed NMR spectroscopic studies. Nearly complete backbone and side chain 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments of Ets-1ΔN301 were obtained through a suite of 1H/13C/15N scalar and NOE-correlated experiments (Fig. 1B). Critical to this process was uniform 2H isotopic labeling, which helped to enhance spectral sensitivity and resolution. Selective 2H isotopic labeling of aromatic residues also aided in the resonance assignments of their side chain nuclei, while selective 13Cβ-alanine labeling of Ets-1ΔN301 facilitated analysis of the poorly resolved signals from 323AAALA328 within the N-terminal inhibitory region. These extensive assignments permitted the detailed structural and dynamic analyses of Ets-1ΔN301. NMR-based Structure Determination of Ets-1ΔN301—The tertiary structure of Ets-1ΔN301 was calculated with ARIA/CNS (27Bru ̈nger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

In this work, we investigated the kinetics of fibril formation using our newly developed off-lattice intermediate resolution model, PRIME. The model is simple enough to allow the treatment of large multichain systems while maintaining a fairly realistic description of protein dynamics without built-in bias toward any conformation when used in conjunction with constant temperature discontinuous molecular dynamics, a fast alternative to conventional molecular dynamics. Simulations were performed on systems containing 48–96 model Ac-KA14K-NH2 peptides. We found that fibril formation for polyalanines incorporate features that are characteristic of three models, the templated assembly, nucleated polymerization, and nucleated conformational conversion models, but that none of them gave a completely satisfactory description of the simulation kinetics. Fibril formation was nucleation-dependent, occurring after a lag time that decreased with increasing peptide concentration and increased with increasing temperature. Fibril formation appeared to be a conformational conversion process in which small amorphous aggregates → β-sheets → ordered nucleus → subsequent rapid growth of a small stable fibril or protofilament. Fibril growth in our simulations involved both β-sheet elongation, in which the fibril grew by adding individual peptides to the end of each β-sheet, and lateral addition, in which the fibril grew by adding already formed β-sheets to its side. The initial rate of fibril formation increased with increasing concentration and decreased with increasing temperature.

However, recent evidence that proteins other than those associated with amyloid diseases form fibrils in vitro under mildly denaturing conditions (7Guijarro J.I. Sunde M. Jones J.A. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 8Chiti F. Webster P. Toddei N. Clark A. Stefan M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) has led leaders in the field to suggest that fibril formation is an intrinsic property of polypeptides, albeit under appropriate conditions. This implies that progress toward understanding the origins of various protein deposition diseases can be made by in vitro or in silico examination of the general features of protein fibrillization using model proteins that are less complex than the specific amyloidogenic protein. Here we performed computer simulations on systems containing polyalanine-based peptides of the sequence Ac-KA14K-NH2 in an attempt to help further understanding of the molecular level mechanisms that are responsible for fibril formation. Our molecular dynamics simulations were conducted on systems containing many peptides initially in the random-coil state. Four mechanisms have been proposed to describe the conformational transformation and assembly of normally soluble proteins into ordered aggregates (10Kelly J.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 824-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The first is the templated assembly mechanism (11Uratani Y. Asakura S. Imahori K. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 67: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Griffith J.S. Nature. 1967; 215: 1043-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), in which a soluble random-coil peptide binds to a preassembled β-sheet-rich nucleus and then undergoes a rate-determining structural change. The second is the monomer-directed conversion mechanism (13Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4014) Google Scholar), in which a monomeric peptide adopts a conformation that is identical to that found in the fibril, binds to another soluble monomer in a rate-determining step, converts that monomer to the conformation found in the fibril, and then dissociates, with both peptides rapidly added to the end of the growing fibril. The third is the nucleated polymerization mechanism (14Jarrett J.T. Lansbury P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar, 15Hofrichter J. Ross P.D. Eaton W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4864-4868Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 16Beaven G.H. Gratzer W.B. Davies H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 11: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which is characterized by the rate-limiting formation of a nucleus followed by the rapid addition of monomers to the growing end of the nucleus. The fourth is the nucleated-conformational conversion mechanism (17Serio T.R. Cashikar A.G. Kowal A.S. Sawicki G.J. Moslehi J.J. Serpell L. Arnsdorf M.F. Lindquist S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), in which the formation of small amorphous aggregates precedes the rate-limiting formation of a critical nucleus and subsequent rapid growth of large fibrils through the addition of globular multimers to fibril ends. All of the above mentioned mechanisms require that the system go through a nucleation event before fibrils can be formed. The nucleus in the monomer-directed conversion mechanism is a monomeric peptide, whereas the nuclei in the templated assembly, nucleated polymerization, and nucleated-conformational conversion mechanisms are oligomers. The general picture of the fibril formation process that accompanies three of the four mechanisms described above, the templated assembly, nucleated polymerization, and nucleated-conformational conversion mechanisms, is the following. Fibril formation is initiated when the native state of a protein is slightly destabilized, for example, by changing pH, exposing structural elements on the resulting partially folded intermediates, which then begin to associate intermolecularly rather than intramolecularly. If the protein monomer concentration is greater than some critical concentration, the partially folded intermediates slowly associate via a series of energetically unfavorable steps, resulting in the formation of an oligomer after a defined period, called the lag time. This oligomer serves as the nucleus for the rapid growth and elongation of protofilaments or small fibrils, either through monomer addition at the protofilament tip or through end-to-end association of short protofilaments. Eventually, several protofilaments associate to form fibrils, which then grow further by the addition of more protofilaments. If the protein monomer concentration is less than the critical concentration, fibrillization can still take place by homogeneous (or heterogeneous) seeding in which case nucleation occurs on protein (or non-protein) species. Most simulation studies to date of fibril-forming peptides by other investigators have been limited to the study of either isolated peptides (18Kortvelyesi T. Kiss G. Murphy R.F. Penke B. Lovas S. J.

These studies have employed high resolution protein models, which are based on a realistic representation of protein geometry and a fairly faithful accounting for the energetics of every atom on the protein and on the solvent.

Given current computational capabilities, simpler models are required. This has been recognized by a few investigators who have combined intermediate resolution protein models with the Go potentials to look at fibril formation. Such an approach has been taken by Jang et al. (42Jang H. Hall C.K. Zhou Y. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 31-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 43Jang H. Hall C.K. Zhou Y. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 40-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), who studied the thermodynamics and kinetics of the assembly of four model β-sheet peptides into a tetrameric β-sheet complex, and by Ding et al. (44Ding F. Dokholyan N.V. Buldyrev S.V. Stanley H.E. Shakhnovich E.I. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), who studied the formation of a fibrillar double β-sheet structure containing eight model Src SH3 domain proteins. However, since the Go potential contains a built-in bias toward the native conformation, this approach is not suitable for the study of spontaneous fibril formation from random configurations. We developed an alternative approach, inspired in part by the models of Sun (45Sun S. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 762-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), Sun et al. (46Sun S. Thomas P.D. Dill K.A. Protein. Eng. 1995; 8: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and Takada et al. (47Takada S. Luthey-Schulten Z. Wolynes P.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1999; 110: 11616-11629Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar), that represents each amino acid residue with three backbone beads and one side chain bead. Our model, which we now call PRIME (Protein Intermediate Resolution Model), allows the treatment of large multichain systems while maintaining a fairly realistic description of protein dynamics without built-in bias toward any conformation (48Smith A.V. Hall C.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 44: 344-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 49Nguyen H.D. Marchut A.J. Hall C.K. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2909-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By combining PRIME (described below) with discontinuous molecular dynamics simulation, we have been able to simulate the formation of small fibrils or protofilaments by systems containing between 12 and 96 16-residue Ac-KA14K-NH2 peptides starting from the random-coil state. This model, which was developed by Smith and Hall (48Smith A.V. Hall C.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 44: 344-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 50Smith A.V. Hall C.K.

Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2909-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), represents each amino acid with four beads, three for the backbone and one for the side chain. It is designed to be used with discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) 1The abbreviations used are: DMD, discontinuous molecular dynamics; HP, hydrophobic interactions; HB, hydrogen bonds.1The abbreviations used are: DMD, discontinuous molecular dynamics; HP, hydrophobic interactions; HB, hydrogen bonds.

Phys. 1980; 39: 781-782Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar), an extremely fast alternative to traditional molecular dynamics that is applicable to systems of molecules interacting via discontinuous potentials, e.g. hard sphere and square well potentials. Solvent is modeled implicitly by including hydrophobic interactions between non-polar side chains. Backbone hydrogen bonding is modeled in explicit detail. The applicability of our model to polyalanine was tested in a previous study of isolated polyalanine in which we examined the predicted folding transition and the conditions under which common structures such as the α-helix and β-hairpin appear (49Nguyen H.D. Marchut A.J. Hall C.K. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2909-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Specifically, we examined the effect of temperature on the populations of the various structural states of the peptide, calculated the Zimm-Bragg equilibrium constants for propagation and nucleation of the helix, measured the hydrogen bond distances and angles for polyalanine in the α-helix and β-hairpin, and mapped out the Ramachandran plot. We found that our results agree with experimental and other simulation data very well. Although PRIME gives a fairly realistic description of polyalanine, it is essentially a work in progress; we are now in the process of extending the model to the rest of the amino acids. By combining PRIME with DMD, we were able to sample much wider regions of conformational space, longer time scales, and larger systems than in traditional molecular dynamics (56Nguyen H.D. Hall C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16180-16185Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Since the simulations take only days on a work station, we were able to conduct simulations at a wide variety of concentrations and temperatures and to learn how peptide concentration and temperature affect the formation of various Ac-KA14K-NH2 structures, including amorphous aggregates, α-helices, β-sheets, and fibrils. All simulations were performed in the canonical ensemble starting from a random coil configuration equilibrated at a high temperature and then slowly cooled to the temperature of interest so as to minimize kinetic trapping in local free energy minima. In this study, we investigated the kinetics of fibril formation of Ac-KA14K-NH2 peptides as a function of the peptide concentration and temperature. Simulations were conducted on systems containing 48 model 16-residue peptides at a wide variety of concentrations and temperatures using the same protein model as in our previous studies (56Nguyen H.D. Hall C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16180-16185Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). All simulations were performed in the canonical ensemble; constant temperature was achieved by implementing the Andersen thermostat method (57Andersen H.C. J. Chem. Phys. 1980; 72: 2384-2393Crossref Scopus (4495) Google Scholar) in which united atoms were subjected to random collisions with ghost particles, the velocities of which were chosen randomly from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution centered at the system temperature. During each simulation, the formation of different structures such as α-helices, aggregates, β-sheets, or fibrils was monitored as a function of time. Key fibril-forming events associated with the four proposed fibril-forming mechanisms mentioned earlier were identified. Two types of simulations were conducted: unseeded and seeded. In the unseeded simulations, the peptides, which were initially in a random coil configuration, were equilibrated at a high temperature and then quickly cooled to the temperature of interest. The lag time and rate of fibril formation were monitored to study their dependence upon the peptide concentration and temperature. In the seeded simulations, a previously created single small fibril was immersed in a sea of denatured chains. The model peptide chosen for study is the polyalanine-based peptide Ac-KA14K-NH2. We focused on polyalanine-based peptides for three reasons. First, the small, uncharged, unbranched nature of alanine residues is amenable to simulation with the intermediate resolution protein model that we developed previously (48Smith A.V. Hall C.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 44: 344-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 50Smith A.V. Hall C.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 44: 376-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Second, polyalanine repeats have been implicated in human pathologies, notably in the formation of anomalous filamentous intranuclear inclusions in oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy patients (58Brais B. Rouleau G.A. Bouchard J.P. Farde M. Tome F.M.S. Semin. Neurol. 1999; 19: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Third, synthetic polyalanine-based peptides have been shown by Blondelle and co-workers (59Forood B. Perez-Paya E. Houghten R.A. Blondelle S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 60Blondelle S.E. Forood B. Houghten R.A. Perez-Paya E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8393-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) to undergo a transition from α-helical structures to β-sheet complexes in vitro, mimicking the structural transition that is believed to be a prerequisite for fibril nucleation and growth (1Kirschner D.A.

Commun. 1995; 211: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 60Blondelle S.E. Forood B. Houghten R.A. Perez-Paya E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8393-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) observed that the α-helical structures were stabilized in part by intramolecular α-helical bonds and that the macromolecular β-sheet complexes were stabilized by hydrophobic intersheet interactions. Using circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, they found that: 1) β-sheet complex formation increased with increasing temperature, exhibiting an S-shaped dependence on temperature with a critical temperature of 45 °C at a peptide concentration of 1.8 mm and an incubation time of 3 h and 2) β-sheet complex formation increased with increasing peptide concentration above a critical concentration of 1 mm at 65 °C. Blondelle and co-workers (59Forood B. Perez-Paya E. Houghten R.A. Blondelle S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 60Blondelle S.E. Forood B.

This means that we could not compare our simulation data with experimental results directly. Instead we compared our results with the general features of the available kinetic models since these were formulated on the basis of experimental observations of fibril formation by other peptides. Highlights of our results are as follows. We observed that fibril formation of polyalanines in our simulations was not perfectly described by any of the proposed fibril formation mechanisms available in the literature. It did, however, share certain features in common with three of the proposed mechanisms: templated assembly, nucleated polymerization, and nucleated conformational conversion. These common features were that: 1) fibril formation was nucleation-dependent and 2) the lag time, which is the delay time before fibril formation commences, increased with increasing temperature. As suggested by the nucleated polymerization model, the lag time at high temperatures decreased more or less exponentially as a function of the peptide concentration. As suggested by the templated assembly model, the lag time at low temperatures decreased more or less linearly with increasing peptide concentration. As predicted by the nucleated conformational conversion model, small amorphous aggregate formation preceded critical nucleus formation. Fibril growth in our simulations involved both β-sheet elongation, in which the fibril grew by adding individual peptides to the end of each β-sheet, and lateral addition, in which the fibril grew by adding already formed β-sheets to its side. The initial rate of fibril growth increased with increasing concentration and decreased with increasing temperature. Model Peptide and Forces—The model peptide had the sequence PH14P, where H is a hydrophobic amino acid residue and P is a polar amino acid residue. This sequence was chosen to mimic Ac-KA14K-NH2 peptides, which have been shown to form stable, soluble β-sheet complexes in vitro (59Forood B. Perez-Paya E. Houghten R.A. Blondelle S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 60Blondelle S.E. Forood B. Houghten R.A. Perez-Paya E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8393-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The peptide was modeled using PRIME, an intermediate resolution model (48Smith A.V. Hall C.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 44: 344-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 49Nguyen H.D. Marchut A.J. Hall C.K. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2909-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 50Smith A.V.

Biol. 2001; 312: 187-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) based on a four-bead amino acid representation with realistic bond lengths and bond-angle constraints that has the ability to interact both intra- and intermolecularly via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction potentials. The geometry of the PRIME protein model is illustrated in Fig. 1. Each amino acid residue was composed of four spheres, a three-sphere backbone comprised of united atom NH, C–H, and C=O, and a single bead side chain R (labeled N, Cα, C, and R, respectively, in the figure). All backbone bond lengths and bond angles were fixed at their ideal values; the distance between consecutive Cα atoms was fixed so as to maintain the interpeptide bond in the trans configuration. The side chains were held in positions relative to the backbone so that all residues are l-isomers. Details of the model including values for all parameters are given in our earlier studies (48Smith A.V. Hall C.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 44: 344-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 49Nguyen H.D. Marchut A.J. Hall C.K. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2909-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The solvent was modeled implicitly in the sense that its effect was factored into the energy function as a potential of mean force. All forces were modeled by either hard sphere or square well potentials. The excluded volumes of the four beads were modeled using hard sphere potentials with realistic diameters. Covalent bonds were maintained between adjacent spheres along the backbone by imposing hard sphere repulsions whenever the bond lengths attempted to move outside of the range between l(1 – δ) and l(1 + δ), where l is the bond length and δ is a tolerance which we set equal to 2.375%. Ideal backbone bond angles, Cα-Cα distances, and residue l-isomerization were achieved by imposing pseudobonds, as shown in Fig. 1, which also fluctuated within a tolerance of 2.375%. Hydrogen bonding between amide hydrogen atoms and carbonyl oxygen atoms on the same or neighboring chains was represented by a square well attraction of strength ϵHB (where HB is hydrogen bonds) between NH and C=O united atoms whenever: 1) the virtual hydrogen and oxygen atoms (the location of which can be calculated at any time) we"
https://openalex.org/W2024867289,"γ-Secretase is an aspartyl protease complex composed of the four core components APH-1, nicastrin (NCT), presenilin (PS), and PEN-2. It catalyzes the final intramembranous cleavage of the β-secretase-processed β-amyloid precursor protein to liberate the neurotoxic amyloid β-peptide. Whereas unassembled complex components appear to be unstable and/or to be retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the fully assembled complex is known to exert its biological function in late secretory compartments, including the plasma membrane. We thus hypothesized that the γ-secretase complex undergoes a stepwise assembly within the ER. We demonstrate that γ-secretase-associated NCT can be actively retained within the ER by the addition of a retention signal. Under these conditions, complex assembly occurred in the absence of maturation of NCT, and ER-retained immature NCT associated with APH-1, PEN-2, and PS fragments. Moreover, a biotinylated transition state γ-secretase inhibitor allowed the preferential isolation of the fully assembled complex containing immature NCT. Furthermore, we observed a conformational change in immature NCT, which is known to be selectively associated with complete γ-secretase complex assembly. This was also observed for a small amount of immature endogenous NCT. ER-retained NCT also rescued the biochemical phenotype observed upon RNA interference-mediated NCT knockdown, viz. reduced amyloid β-peptide production; instability of PS, PEN-2, and APH-1; and accumulation of β-amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragments. Finally, we demonstrate that dimeric (NCT/APH-1) and trimeric (NCT/APH-1/PS) intermediates of γ-secretase complex assembly containing endogenous NCT are retained within the ER and that the incorporation of the fourth and last binding partner (PEN-2) also occurs on immature NCT, suggesting a complete assembly of the γ-secretase complex within the ER. γ-Secretase is an aspartyl protease complex composed of the four core components APH-1, nicastrin (NCT), presenilin (PS), and PEN-2. It catalyzes the final intramembranous cleavage of the β-secretase-processed β-amyloid precursor protein to liberate the neurotoxic amyloid β-peptide. Whereas unassembled complex components appear to be unstable and/or to be retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the fully assembled complex is known to exert its biological function in late secretory compartments, including the plasma membrane.

Alzheimer's disease is a serious public health problem, and a dramatic increase in Alzheimer's disease patients is apparent in our rapidly aging society. Pathologically, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of tangles and senile plaques (1Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10848) Google Scholar). Senile plaques are composed of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), 1The abbreviations used are: Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; swAPP, Swedish mutant β-amyloid precursor protein; TMD, transmembrane domain; PS, presenilin; NCT, nicastrin; NCTwt, wild-type nicastrin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HEK, human embryonic kidney; RNAi, RNA interference; CT, C terminus; NT, N terminus; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CHAPSO, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid; CTF, C-terminal fragment; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. 1The abbreviations used are: Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; swAPP, Swedish mutant β-amyloid precursor protein; TMD, transmembrane domain; PS, presenilin; NCT, nicastrin; NCTwt, wild-type nicastrin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HEK, human embryonic kidney; RNAi, RNA interference; CT, C terminus; NT, N terminus; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CHAPSO, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid; CTF, C-terminal fragment; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. which is generated by proteolytic processing from the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (2Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Secretases (named after the secretion of some of their cleavage products) cut APP within and around the Aβ domain. β-Secretase mediates the N-terminal amyloidogenic cut and competes with the non-amyloidogenic α-secretase, which prevents Aβ production by cleaving in the middle of the Aβ domain (2Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The cleavage products of β- and α-secretases (99- and 83-amino acid C-terminal fragments) are the direct substrates for the γ-secretase enzyme. This cleavage occurs within the transmembrane domain (TMD) and is exerted by an aspartyl protease complex composed of the four core components presenilin (PS)-1 or -2, nicastrin (NCT), APH-1a/b (anterior pharynx-defective-1; in this work, we refer to the long splice variant APH-1aL (3Francis R.

This is now strongly supported by a number of independent observations. In the absence of PS1 and PS2, no authentic Aβ is produced (4Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L.

Moreover, numerous familial Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in the PS genes shift the ratio from the predominant 40-amino acid Aβ species to the more aggregation-prone 42-amino acid variant (2Haass C.

We hypothesized that γ-secretase complex components may be retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as long as the complex is not fully assembled. To identify the cellular compartment where γ-secretase complex assembly occurs, we attached an ER retention signal to the cytoplasmic domain of NCT. By forcing the assembly of the γ-secretase complex on immature NCT, we demonstrate that a fully functional γ-secretase complex can be generated within the ER. Moreover, endogenously assembled complex intermediates containing only two or three components were retained within the ER, but were released after the missing γ-secretase subunits were incorporated.

To investigate whether NCT contains such active retention motifs, we used CD4 as a reporter protein (43Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). First, the C-terminal domain of NCT including a V5 tag (note that the V5 tag does not interfere with the physiological function of NCT; see below) was fused to CD4, creating CD4-NCT-CT-V5 (Fig. 1A). Second, the TMD of CD4 was exchanged with the TMD of NCT to create the CD4 variant CD4-NCT-TM-V5 (Fig. 1A). Upon transfection of COS-7 cells with CD4-NCT-CT-V5 or CD4-NCT-TM-V5, intracellular and plasma membrane immunostaining was carried out (Fig. 1B). Both fusion proteins showed punctuate intracellular staining as well as strong labeling of the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B). A similar pattern was found when CD4 alone (data not shown) or a cDNA construct encoding CD4 fused to 36 amino acids of the C terminus of a KATP channel with a mutagenized inactive ER retention signal (CD4-AAAsurface) (43Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) was investigated (Fig. 1B). This indicates that the cytoplasmic tail and TMD of NCT do not contain an active ER retention signal. To further address the question of whether γ-secretase complex assembly occurs within the ER, NCT was forced to be retained within the ER by the addition of an ER retention signal. We first confirmed the function of the well established KKXX motif for ER retention (44Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) fused to the C terminus of a V5 tag variant of NCT using the CD4 reporter system (Fig. 1A). CD4-NCT-CT-V5-ER was retained within the ER, and only very little surface staining could be detected (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the CD4-RKRER variant (Fig. 1A), in which the last 36 amino acids of the C terminus of a KATP channel with an active ER retention signal (RKR) (43Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) are fused to CD4, was also efficiently retained within the ER (Fig. 1B). To analyze whether NCT that is actively retained within the ER influences γ-secretase complex formation and function, we transfected an NCT variant with a functionally active ER retention signal (for ER retention signal, see Fig. 1) in an NCT knockdown HEK 293 cell line stably expressing swAPP (26Shirotani K.

More recently, it has been demonstrated that nucleotide triphosphates derivatized at the ribose 2′-or3′-exocyclic ribose ring oxygen atoms by the fluorescent MANT moiety are also highly potent inhibitors of mAC (21Gille A. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12672-12679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Gille A. Lushington G.H. Mou T.C. Doughty M.B. Johnson R.A. Seifert R. J. Biol.

The unexpected inhibitory activity of MANT-GTP suggests novel routes for the design of inhibitors for mAC, which, as a significant target of G protein-coupled receptor stimulation, may be considered an appropriate target for drug development. Crystal structures have been determined of complexes between the homologous cytosolic catalytic domains of mAC bound to FSK and GTPγS-activated Gαs (16Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In these studies, the C1 and C2 domains, which constitute the N- and C-terminal halves of the catalytic core, were derived from type V and type II isoforms of AC and are thus designated VC1 and IIC2, respectively. The crystallographic studies revealed that both P-site inhibitors and substrate analogs bind, together with the metal ion co-factors, to the catalytic site located at the interface between C1 and C2. FSK occupies a site related by 2-fold pseudosymmetry to the catalytic site. Crystal structures have also been determined of the Gαs-activated mAC catalytic core complexed with various P-site inhibitors and substrate analogs (17Tesmer J.J. Dessauer C.W. Sunahara R.K.

Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Upon binding to potent P-site inhibitors and substrate analogs such as 2′-deoxyadenosine 3′-monophosphate (Ki = 1.2 μm) (24Desaubry L. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2380-2382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-ATP, VC1·IIC2 undergoes a transition from an “open” to a “closed” conformation in which the α1–α2, β2–β3, and α3-β4 loops of C1 and the β7′–β8′ loop of C2 move toward each other, thereby closing the gap between the purine-binding pocket in the C2 domain and the triphosphate binding loop (P-loop) located primarily in the C1 domain (16Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). This conformational change also places the N terminus of the C1 domain α1 helix (the P-loop) in hydrogen bond contact with the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP. Therefore, the architecture of the closed conformation constitutes the functional catalytic structure that facilitates substrate binding. In contrast, weak inhibitors comparable in affinity with the substrate ATP (Km = 0.4 mm), such as the nonhydrolyzable α-β methylene derivative of ATP, bind to the open conformation of the enzyme (8Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the C1 domain, two divalent metal ions are coordinated by the invariant aspartic acid residues Asp-396 and Asp-440 (type V AC numbering). These metal cations, which bind to sites designated “A” and “B” are, in the closed conformation of the enzyme, in position to bind the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP. The metal ion in site A is proposed to function as a Lewis acid by coordinating the 3′-ribosyl hydroxyl group (17Tesmer J.J. Dessauer C.W. Sunahara R.K. Murray L.D. Johnson R.A. Gilman A.G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19650-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) led to the understanding that the cyclization of ATP is catalyzed by a “two-metal ion” mechanism similar to that used by DNA polymerases (17Tesmer J.J.

Biol. 1998; 8: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Also apparent from these studies is the plasticity of the mAC-binding site, which allows variation in the binding mode by which phosphate groups (derived from the nucleotide or from pyrophosphate) and metal ions are accommodated (16Tesmer J.J.

Nucleotides derivatized at the ribose moiety by the fluorescent MANT group, several of which have been used as probes of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis in G proteins and other nucleotidases, were found to be highly potent competitive inhibitors of mAC (21Gille A. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12672-12679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A systematic analysis of MANT nucleotide inhibition of several mAC isoforms showed MANT-GTP to have the greatest affinity and potency toward VC1·IIC2 (Ki = 4.2 nm) and to show selectivity among mAC isoforms (22Gille A.

Additionally, replacement of Mg2+ by Mn2+ increases the inhibitory potency of MANT-GTPγS by 9-fold. In the present work, we have determined the crystal structures of the FSK and Gαs·GTPγS-activated VC1·IIC2 with MANT-GTP bound to the catalytic site in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ and have further probed the structure of the complexes by fluorescence spectroscopy. Our results show that the accommodation of the MANT group by the mAC catalytic site results in a novel mechanism of inhibition. Preparation of Proteins and Materials—Plasmids encoding the wild type and mutant AC C1a domain from canine type V (VC1), C2a domain from rat type II (IIC2), and bovine Gαs, consisting of residues of 364–580, 874–1081, and 1–396, respectively, were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells, and the proteins were purified and stored as described previously (27Tesmer J.J.

Mutants VC1-A409P (substitution of Ala-409 with Pro) and IIC2-I1006V (substitution of Ile-1006 with Val) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange; Stratagene). Except for IIC2, both VC1 and Gαs constructs contained a hexahistidine tag at their N termini. Gαs was activated by incubation with 10 μm GTPγS and 2 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for 1 h, and the resulting Gαs·GTPγS complex was further digested by trypsin to a smaller fragment comprising residues 39–387 (27Tesmer J.J.

MANT-GTP, 2′-deoxy-3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-adenosine 5′-triphosphate, MANT-ATP, and 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-xanthosine 5′-triphosphate were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) or JenaBioscience (Jena, Germany). MANT-cGMP was gift from Dr. H.-G. Genieser (Biolog Life Sciences Institute, Bremen, Germany). GTPγS was from Roche Applied Science. Forskolin and MP-FSK were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). [α-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Adenylyl Cyclase Complex Formation and Crystallization with MANT-GTP—Purified recombinant VC1, IIC2, and trypsin-treated Gαs·GTPγS were mixed in a 1.5:1:1 molar ratio to form a heterotrimeric complex in the presence of excess MP-FSK and GTPγS. The protein mixture was purified by gel filtration using tandemly arranged Superdex 75 and 200 columns (Amersham Biosciences), and fractions containing the heterotrimeric complex were collected and concentrated to 8 mg/ml in a buffer of 20 mm Na+HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 25 μm MP-FSK, and 10 μm GTPγS for crystallization. Protein crystals were grown by the sitting drop method with a reservoir containing 7.5% (mass/volume) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 m MES, pH 5.6, at 16 °C. After 4–6 weeks, the crystals were soaked in reservoir solution with additional 2.5 mm MANT-GTP and 3 mm MgCl2 or MnCl2 for 1–2 h at room temperature and then harvested in cryoprotectant (10% (mass/volume) polyethylene glycol 8000, 30% (mass/volume) polyethylene glycol 400, 500 mm NaCl, 100 mm MES, pH 5.4, 20 mm Na+HEPES, pH 8.0, 3.3 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm MP-FSK, and 0.17 mm GTPγS). Cryoprotected crystals were mounted in 0.1–0.2-mm loops and stored in liquid nitrogen. Structure Determination and Model Refinement—Diffraction data sets were collected by the oscillation method (1°/frame, 45 s/frame) at the Advanced Photon Synchrotron SBC-CAT BM19 Beamline with an incident beam wavelength of 1.0393 Å. The images were processed with the HKL2000 package (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) (Table I). Because of anisotropy, data with l index >21 for crystals of the MANT-GTP·Mg2+ complex and l index >18 for crystals of the MANT-GTP·Mn2+ complex were excluded from the dataset. Crystals of the VC1·IIC2·FSK·MANT-GTP·Gαs·GTPγS complex were approximately isomorphous with those of the VC1·IIC2·FSK·Gαs·GTPγS complex (16Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

The measurements were performed in a quartz fluorescence microcuvette (Hellma, Plainview, NY). The final assay volume was 150 μl. The reaction mixtures contained a buffer consisting of 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MnCl2, or 10 mm MgCl2 and 25 mm Na+HEPES, pH 7.4. Steady-state emission spectra were recorded at low speed with λex = 350 nm (λem = 370–500 nm) and λex = 280 nm (λem = 300–500 nm) with 1 μm MANT-GTP in the absence and presence of 5 μm VC1 plus 25 μm IIC2 without and with 100 μm MP-FSK unless otherwise indicated. AC Activity Assays—For determination of Km and Vmax values, the assay tubes contained 40 μm to 1.5 mm ATP/Mn2+, 10 mm MnCl2, or 40 μm to 1.5 mm ATP/Mg2+ and 10 mm MgCl2, in a buffer consisting of 100 mm KCl and 25 mm Na+HEPES, pH 7.4. For determination of the Ki values of MANT nucleotides, the reaction mixtures contained 100 μm ATP/Mn2+, 10 mm MnCl2, or 100 μm ATP/Mg2+, 10 mm MgCl2, and MANT nucleotides at concentrations from 1 nm to 1 mm as appropriate to obtain saturated inhibition curves. Additionally, the assay tubes contained VC1 and IIC2 at a ratio of 1:5. For experiments with Gαs-GTPγS, the ratio of VCI·IIC2·Gαs-GTPγS was 1:5:17. Depending on the specific experimental conditions examined, the absolute concentration of VC1 was varied between 3 and 100 nm to ensure both sensitive detection of product formation and linearity of substrate turnover. The reactions were conducted in the absence and presence of 100 μm FSK. Following a 2-min preincubation at 30 °C, the reactions were initiated by adding 20 μl of reaction mixture containing (final) 1.0 to 10 μCi/tube [α-32P]ATP, 2.7 mm mono(cyclohexyl)ammonium phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.125 IU pyruvate kinase, 1 IU myokinase, and 0.1 mm cAMP. The reactions were conducted for 10 - 30 min at 30 °C and were terminated by the addition of 20 μlof2.2 n HCl. Denatured protein was sedimented by a 1-min centrifugation at 25 °C and 15,000 × g. Sixty-five μl of the supernatant fluid were applied onto disposable columns filled with 1.3 g of neutral alumina (Sigma A-1522, super I, WN-6). [32P]cAMP was separated from [α-32P]ATP by elution of [32P]cAMP with 4 ml of 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0 (31Alvarez R. Daniels D.V. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recovery of [32P]cAMP was ∼80% as assessed with [3H]cAMP as standard. The blank values were routinely ∼0.01% of the total amount of [α-32P]ATP added, ensuring sensitive detection of [32P]cAMP formation even at low activities (such as in the presence of Mg2+ alone). [32P]cAMP was determined by Cherenkov radiation or liquid scintillation counting using Ecolume scintillation mixture (Fisher). Data Analysis and Data Reproducibility—Fluorescence recordings were analyzed with the spectrum package of the Cary Eclipse software (Varian). Base-line fluorescence (buffer alone) was subtracted. Fig. 4 shows superimposed original fluorescence recordings. Similar results were obtained in four independent experiments using two different batches of VC1 and IIC2. Substrate saturation experiments and competition experiments with MANT-GTP were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the Prism 3.02 software (GraphPad). Crystal Structures of MANT-GTP·Mn2+and MANT-GTP·Mg2+Complexes—Structures of the Gαs·GTPγS·VC1·IIC2·FSK protein complex containing MANT-GTP·Mn2+ or MANT-GTP·Mg2+ were determined to resolutions of 2.8 and 2.9 Å, respectively (Fig. 1). The |Fo| - |Fc| omit electron density for the MANT-GTP in the catalytic site is well defined and of sufficient quality to allow the position and orientation of the purine, ribose, MANT, and 5′-triphosphate groups to be unambiguously determined (Fig. 2). In particular, the electron density of the planar purine ring and the ribose moieties delimits the positions of the hydrogen bonding groups of the former in the binding cavity, even though they are not clearly resolved in the electron density (see Fig. S1 published online as supplementary material). Electron density for the B-site metal ion is well defined in both structures (see Fig. S2 published as supplementary material on line), but density for the A-site is weaker than that for the B-site in the Mg2+-bound complex. MANT-GTP·Mn2+ appears better ordered than MANT-GTP·Mg2+. With the assumption of 100% occupancy, the average temperature factors of bound FSK and GTPγS are 32 and 38 Å2 in the MANT-GTP·Mn2+ and MANT-GTP·Mg2+ structures, respectively. However, the average temperature factors for MANT-GTP·Mn2+ and MANT-GTP·Mg2+ are 55 and 73 Å2, respectively, indicating greater disorder or lower occupancy of MANT-GTP·Mg2+ in complex with VC1·IIC2.Fig. 2Difference electron density for 3·-O-MANT-GTP in complex with Gαs·VC1·IIC2. The complexes formed in the presence with Mn2+ or Mg2+ are shown in A and B, respectively. The blue wire cage corresponds to |Fo| - |Fc| electron density contoured at 2.5 σ. Coordinates for MANT-GTP and the two metal ions were omitted from the phasing model.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The MANT fluorophore is bound in a cavity at the interface between the β1–α1–α2 loop of VC1 and the α4′–β5′ and β7′–β8′ loops of IIC2 (Fig. 1, A and B). To accommodate the MANT group within the cavity, the MANT-GTP adopts an orientation in the catalytic site that is related to that of other substrate or P-site analogs by a ∼180° rotation about the purine-phosphate axis. The consequences of this unexpected binding mode on the conformation of C1·C2, recognition of the nucleotide moiety and metal ions by the enzyme and the mechanism of inhibition by MANT-GTP, are described below. The conformation of the MANT-GTP-bound C1·C2 complex is midway between the open and closed states. As shown in Fig. 1B, in which the MANT-GTP-bound, β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-ATP-bound, and unbound structures are superimposed, the β1–α1–α2 and α3–β4 loops of VC1 and β7′–β8′ of IIC2 shift toward the domain interface but fail to close fully. Superposition of the MANT-GTP-bound complex with unliganded (open) and β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-ATP-bound (closed) complexes yields an overall rmsd of 0.6 and 0.8 Å, respectively, for all equivalent Cα positions of the VC1·IIC2 complex. However, rmsd values for the Cα atoms in the latter interfacial structural elements are considerably larger: 1.9 Å with respect to the closed complex and 1.0 Å with respect to the open complex. For comparison, the rmsd for the same Cα atoms after superposition of open and closed complexes is 1.9 Å. The MANT fluorophore that is bound between β1–α1–α2 of VC1 and β7′–β8′of IIC2 thus acts as a wedge to prevent VC1·IIC2 from adopting a fully closed conformation. Other than as noted above, global and local structural differences between the Mn2+ and Mg2+ complexes are small, as indicated by the rmsd between equivalent Cα positions of 0.4 Å. The largest differences are apparent in the α1 helix, β1–α1 loop, and α3–β4 loop of VC1 in the MANT-GTP·Mg2+ complex, which adopt a slightly more open conformation than the MANT-GTP·Mn2+ structure. This structural difference may reflect the higher affinity of VC1·IIC2 for MANT-GTP·Mn2+ (21Gille A. Seifert R. J. Biol.

The MANT-GTP used in this study is presumably a racemic mixture of ribosyl 2′-O- and 3′-O-MANT derivatives. Our previous molecular modeling studies suggested that MANT nucleotides bind to mAC preferentially in the 2′-O-MANT conformation (21Gille A. Seifert R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2076770170,"In this study, we address the mechanism of visual arrestin release from light-activated rhodopsin using fluorescently labeled arrestin mutants. We find that two mutants, I72C and S251C, when labeled with the small, solvent-sensitive fluorophore monobromobimane, exhibit spectral changes only upon binding light-activated, phosphorylated rhodopsin. Our analysis indicates that these changes are probably due to a burying of the probes at these sites in the rhodopsin-arrestin or phospholipid-arrestin interface. Using a fluorescence approach based on this observation, we demonstrate that arrestin and retinal release are linked and are described by similar activation energies. However, at physiological temperatures, we find that arrestin slows the rate of retinal release ∼2-fold and abolishes the pH dependence of retinal release. Using fluorescence, EPR, and biochemical approaches, we also find intriguing evidence that arrestin binds to a post-Meta II photodecay product, possibly Meta III. We speculate that arrestin regulates levels of free retinal in the rod cell to help limit the formation of damaging oxidative retinal adducts. Such adducts may contribute to diseases like atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Thus, arrestin may serve to both attenuate rhodopsin signaling and protect the cell from excessive retinal levels under bright light conditions.

The visual photoreceptor rhodopsin is perhaps the best model system for understanding the mechanisms used in G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; Rho*, light-activated rhodopsin; Rho-P, phosphorylated rhodopsin; Meta II, metarhodopsin II; Meta III, metarhodopsin III; ROS, rod outer segment, or wild-type rhodopsin in native membranes; ROS*, light-activated rhodopsin in native membranes; ROS-P, phosphorylated rhodopsin in native membranes; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type; RDH, retinal dehydrogenase. signaling, as detailed information exists on the structures and dynamic interactions of the protein constituents (1Ridge K.D. Abdulaev N.G. Sousa M. Palczewski K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Visual activation begins with absorption of light by the 11-cis-retinal chromophore in rhodopsin. The photoactivated form of rhodopsin, Rho* or “Meta II,” interacts with and activates the G-protein transducin, which exchanges nucleotide and then diffuses to interact with downstream effectors. Signaling by Rho* is terminated by slow thermal decay and the release of retinal. Alternatively, signaling can be quickly terminated by a process that begins with phosphorylation of rhodopsin's C-terminal tail through the action of rhodopsin kinase (2Kuhn H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4389-4395Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 3Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Palczewski K. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2003; 22: 417-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated Rho* is then bound by arrestin, which stops signaling by physically occluding the G-protein binding site (4McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 5Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 105-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In the present study, we address how these two inactivation mechanisms are related and, specifically, what governs arrestin release from rhodopsin. Arrestin is known to bind to phosphorylated Meta II, a form in which the photolyzed chromophore all-trans-retinal is still attached to the receptor by a deprotonated Schiff base. Arrestin does not bind phosphorylated opsin, but all-trans retinal added exogenously can stimulate arrestin binding to phosphorylated opsin (6Sachs K. Maretzki D. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 238-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hofmann K.P. Pulvermuller A. Buczylko J. Van Hooser P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15701-15706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies showed indirectly that retinal release and arrestin release are probably interrelated events (7Hofmann K.P.

However, how these processes are linked or whether arrestin binds other photointermediates of rhodopsin (such as the storage form Meta III) is still unknown. In this paper, we demonstrate that arrestin binding and release can be directly observed in real time by monitoring spectral changes in fluorescently labeled arrestin mutants. Our studies employed two different cysteine mutants of arrestin, I72C and S251C, two sites that lie within the experimentally proposed rhodopsin-binding surface on arrestin (9Smith W.C. Dinculescu A. Peterson J.J. McDowell J.H. Mol. Vis. 2004; 10: 392-398PubMed Google Scholar, 62Pulvermuller A. Schroder K. Fischer T. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol.

When these mutants are labeled with the fluorescent probe monobromobimane and incubated with phosphorylated rhodopsin, they exhibit changes in fluorescence upon rhodopsin photoactivation. Importantly, these changes do not occur in the presence of nonphosphorylated rhodopsin, and subsequent analysis suggests that the spectral changes are a direct result of interaction with activated, phosphorylated rhodopsin. In the present study, we demonstrate how these spectral changes can be exploited to obtain information on the rate of arrestin release. Our results provide direct evidence that arrestin and retinal release are indeed linked events and that arrestin slows the rate of retinal release from Rho*-P by ∼2-fold, possibly through a kinetic trap mechanism. In addition, we find that arrestin binding eliminates the pH dependence of retinal release. Surprisingly, we find that a subfraction of arrestin consistently remains bound to phosphorylated rhodopsin long after the decay of the active Meta II species. This latter result provides compelling evidence that arrestin binds Meta III or some other photodecay product. Materials—Frozen bovine retinas were obtained from Lawson and Lawson, Inc. (Lincoln, NE). GBX red light filters were purchased from Eastman Kodak Co., and [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm) and Biomax centrifugal concentrators (10-kDa cut-off) were from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Monobromobimane was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), and [1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-d-pyrroline-3-methyl]methanethiosulfonate spin label was from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Canada). 11-cis-Retinal was a generous gift from Rosalie Crouch (Medical University of South Carolina and NEI, National Institutes of Health). Cuvettes were purchased from Uvonics (Plainview, NY), and round capillaries for EPR measurements were from VitroCom, Inc. (Mountain Lakes, NJ). Band pass filters and long pass filters were acquired from Oriel (Stratford, CT). Acrylamide/bisacrylamine solution (37:5:1) and microcolumns were purchased from Bio-Rad. Spectroscopic grade buffers were from USB Corp. All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma. Preparation of Rod Outer Segments (ROS)—ROS were isolated from bovine retinas as described previously (10Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). All sucrose solutions were made in ROS buffer (70 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm magnesium acetate, pH 6.8), and all procedures were done at 4 °C under red lights. Rhodopsin concentration was assessed by difference spectra in the presence of hydroxylamine (ϵ500 = 40,800 liters cm-1 mol-1). Stocks were snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C. Highly phosphorylated ROS (ROS-P) were prepared by suspending ROS (10 μm final rhodopsin concentration) in ROS buffer, with 20 μm GTP and 3 mm ATP (10-ml final volume). Phosphorylation of rhodopsin by the native rhodopsin kinase was initiated by illumination with a 15-watt bulb from a Kodak safelight (without filter) placed ∼20 cm away, and sedimentation of the membranes was prevented by gently rocking the sample. After 2 h, the reaction was stopped by a 4-fold dilution with ROS buffer (plus 50 mm hydroxylamine and 2% bovine serum albumin). Phosphorylated opsin membranes were then collected by centrifugation (40,000 × g, 50 min). Levels of phosphorylation were quantified with the use of [γ-32P]ATP (10–100 cpm/pmol) as a tracer. Aliquots were removed from the tracer reaction, spotted onto nitrocellulose filters, washed, and subjected to scintillation counting. Our assay indicated that ROS-P with ∼6.4 ± 1.5 phosphates/rhodopsin was created (11Kuhn H. Wilden U. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated opsin membranes were washed by resuspending the pellet using a tissue homogenizer, followed by centrifugation. Membranes were washed twice with low ionic strength buffer (5 mm PIPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) to remove peripheral proteins (12Kuhn H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), followed by three additional washes with ROS buffer. The final washed opsin membranes were regenerated overnight by the addition of a 2-fold excess of 11-cis-retinal (4 °C). The regenerated samples were washed once with ROS buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 50 mm hydroxylamine, twice with 2% bovine serum albumin in ROS buffer, and three times with ROS buffer alone. Nonphosphorylated ROS membranes were prepared identically, except that no ATP was added during the phosphorylation procedure. The turbidity of ROS samples was reduced by continuous sonication using a Branson 1210 bath sonicator (4 °C, 3 min). More than 95% of the rhodopsin retained function after sonication, as assessed by absorption spectroscopy. Synthesis of Synthetic Phosphopeptide 7PP—The 19-amino acid-long peptide analogous to the fully phosphorylated C-terminal tail of rhodopsin was synthesized and purified as described previously (13Puig J. Arendt A. Tomson F.L. Abdulaeva G. Miller R. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Construction, Expression, and Purification of Arrestin—Recombinant bovine visual arrestin with an N-terminal His tag was expressed and purified from Pichia pastoris as described previously (14McDowell J.H. Smith W.C. Miller R.L. Popp M.P. Arendt A. Abdulaeva G. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6119-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mutant constructs I72C and S251C were created utilizing PCR, and the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing on both strands. Labeling of Arrestin—Arrestin samples were buffer-exchanged and concentrated (∼50 μm) in labeling buffer (10 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) by ultrafiltration (Millipore Biomax). Monobromobimane was added from a stock in Me2SO in 10-fold molar excess to arrestin (final Me2SO concentration below 1%). After an incubation of 3 h at room temperature with gentle agitation, samples were centrifuged briefly at 100,000 × g to remove aggregates. Labeled arrestin was bound by multiple passages over His-select resin (Sigma) equilibrated with buffer (10 mm HEPES, 250 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), followed by extensive washing with buffer. Arrestin was eluted with 500 mm imidazole, and the imidazole was removed by size exclusion chromatography (Sephadex G-15; Sigma; 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). The labeling efficiency was calculated using ϵ280 = 26,360 liters cm-1 mol-1 for arrestin and ϵ393 = 5,000 liters cm-1 mol-1 for bimanep (15Mansoor S.E. McHaourab H.S. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16383-16393Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Schubert C. Hirsch J.A. Gurevich V.V. Engelman D.M. Sigler P.B. Fleming K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21186-21190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 392 nm was subtracted from the 280-nm value to compensate for bimane's absorbance at 280 nm. Using this method, labeling efficiencies of ∼83 and 88% were determined for arrestin mutants I72C and S251C, respectively. Since both of these mutants contain the three native cysteines of arrestin (Cys63, Cys128, and Cys143), a sample of wild-type (WT) arrestin was labeled using the same conditions as a control. The WT cysteines labeled at less than ∼2% efficiency. To assess possible free label contamination, the fluorescence of 2 μm labeled arrestin was compared with an identical sample, which had been precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10%). For both I72B and S251B, free label contamination was well below 1%. Functional Pull-down Assay—A simple centrifugation assay was used to assess arrestin functionality. Briefly, sonicated ROS containing 12 μm rhodopsin or phosphorylated rhodopsin and 3 μm arrestin were mixed in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, in the dark at room temperature (20 μl). Reactions were either kept in the dark or bleached for 5 min using a 150-watt fiber optic light source (>495 nm), followed by 10-fold dilution with ice-cold buffer and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were solubilized in loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%). Proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining, and densitometry was performed using AlphaEase FC software. To assess arrestin affinity for post-Meta II rhodopsin, ROS-P in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, was photobleached at room temperature for 90 s and then transferred to a 35 °C water bath. The sample was kept in the dark after the initial photobleach. After 12 min, arrestin I72B was added (1 μm) and incubated at room temperature for an additional 3 min. The samples were diluted, centrifuged, and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. The fluorescently labeled arrestin was visualized with a gel-doc apparatus (Alpha-Innotech FluoroChem 5500). The gel was excited from above with a short wave UV source, and the fluorescent bands were detected through a cut-off filter (535 ± 50 nm) by a CCD camera (5-min exposure). Densitometry was performed using AlphaEase FC software. Steady-state Fluorescence Assays—All fluorescence measurements were made using a Photon Technologies QM-1 steady-state fluorescence spectrophotometer with a single excitation source and two emission detectors (T format). Temperature was controlled and monitored using a water-jacketed cuvette holder connected to a circulating water bath (VWR Scientific) and a digital thermometer, which was submerged into a water-filled well in the sample chamber. Typically, 100-μl samples containing 1 μm labeled arrestin in a 2-mm black-jacketed cuvette were excited at 380 nm, and the emitted fluorescence was measured from 400 to 600 nm using 2-nm increments. Each data point was integrated for 0.25 s, and the average of two scans yielded the final spectrum. Excitation bandpass was kept at 0.25 nm to avoid bleaching of rhodopsin samples (emission bandpass at 15 nm). Spectra were smoothed and analyzed using the PTI software program Felix, and the fluorescence spectra of buffer or rhodopsin alone were subtracted where appropriate. Rhodopsin was generally present at a 4-fold excess to arrestin, which was found to be sufficient for complete arrestin binding. The samples were bleached using a 150-watt fiber optic light source (>495 nm) for 40 s. Fluorescence Lifetime Measurements—A PTI Laserstrobe fluorescence lifetime instrument was used to measure I72B and S251B under different conditions. Typically, 500 nm arrestin in a 4-mm black-jacketed cuvette (200 μl) was measured at 20 °C using 381-nm excitation pulses (full-width half-maximum, ∼1.5 ns) with a 298–435-nm band pass filter on the excitation beam. The emission was monitored through two >470-nm long pass filters, and neutral density filters were used to modulate the intensity. Each data point collected represented two averages of five laser shots, and typically 150 points were collected over the lifetime decay curve. The instrument response function, which must be deconvoluted from lifetime decay data, was determined from the scatter from a solution of Ludox through a 400-nm broadband interference filter. Data points were acquired randomly to minimize the impact of laser misfires on the decay curve, and data were analyzed using the commercial PTI software TimeMaster. The “goodness of fit” was evaluated by plotting the residuals and the χ2 value (0.7 < χ2 < 1.2 was considered acceptable) (17Straume M. Johnson M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). Fluorescent lifetimes of these labeled arrestins were also measured in the presence of the phosphopeptide 7PP (100 μm) or ROS-P (2 μm in the dark state, after photoactivation, and after the addition of 50 mm hydroxylamine). The lifetime data acquisition scheme described above was found to bleach <2% of rhodopsin, and the total time elapsed from the start of photoactivation to the conclusion of the measurement was 4 min, or ∼0.5 Meta II decay half-lives at 20 °C. ROS-P was found to introduce a significant amount of scatter and a fluorescent component with an extremely short lifetime (<1 ns) into the samples. To correct for these components, they were simply subtracted from the arrestin life-time by measuring the lifetime of ROS-P alone with matched concentration under the same conditions. Fluorescence Quenching Analysis—To measure the quenching effects of I- on free versus rhodopsin-bound arrestin, a stock of 4 μm ROS-P and 1 μm labeled arrestin was divided among five tubes (0, 10, 20, 30, or 50 mm KI). KCl was added to keep the ionic strength consistent, and 0.1 mm sodium thiosulfate was present to suppress I3− formation. The steady-state fluorescence of each sample was measured in the dark state and immediately after photoactivation, and the average of two independent experiments was used to calculate quenching constants. KSV is derived from the Stern-Volmer equation F0/F = 1 + KSV[Q], where F0 and F represent the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher, respectively, and [Q] is the concentration of quencher. KSV values were also determined for free arrestin and arrestin in the presence of the phosphopeptide 7PP by titration with KI. The fluorescence was corrected for dilution, and an independent titration with KCl was performed to assess any potential ionic effects on the fluorescence. For time-based quenching studies of arrestin I72B, the average of a range of fluorescence values (λem = 456 nm, 35 °C) was used to derive the Stern-Volmer constants in the dark (300 s prior to activation), after photoactivation (first four points collected after activation), and at the plateau (1200–1500 s after activation). Time-based Fluorescence Assays—To measure arrestin I72B binding, the samples were excited continuously at 380 nm, and the fluorescence emission at 456 nm was monitored (two points/s). The excitation band-pass settings were kept below 0.2 nm, resulting in less than 1% rhodopsin bleaching over a 10-min period. Arrestin binding was measured at 8 °C (1 μm arrestin and 8 μm ROS-P, 55 μl) after irradiation from a Machine Vision Strobe light source for 5 s, which photoactivated 56% of the rhodopsin. Buffer-subtracted data were fit using the program Sigma Plot (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) to a monoexponential equation to define the rate of arrestin binding. Arrestin release was measured in a similar way, except that the excitation shutter was opened for 2 s and then closed for 8 s between measurements to avoid photobleaching. When used, 2 μl of a 300 mm hydroxylamine stock (pH 7) was added, and this was found not to have any effect on the fluorescence of labeled arrestin. Simultaneous monitoring of retinal and arrestin release from ROS-P was accomplished by exciting the sample at 295 nm for 2 s, followed by a 2-s excitation at 380 nm. Fluorescence emission at 330 and 456 nm was monitored (1 point/s), and the shutter was closed for 8 s between measurements. The sample was irradiated for 8 s with a Machine Vision Strobe light source, which photobleached >90% of the rhodopsin. In this way, the change in rhodopsin tryptophan emission due to retinal release (λex = 295 nm; λem = 330 nm) (19Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and the change in bimane fluorescence due to arrestin I72B binding and release (λex = 380 nm; λem = 456 nm) could be monitored simultaneously. The fluorescence contribution from arrestin's one native tryptophan was subtracted from retinal release data, since the fluorescence of this tryptophan does not change upon arrestin activation (20Wilson C.J. Copeland R.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Retinal release from ROS-P without arrestin was measured in the same way, except that no arrestin was present. Data were background-subtracted and fit to either monoexponential rise or decay equations using the program Sigma Plot to derive rates. Goodness of fit was evaluated by plotting the residuals. Arrestin release rates and retinal release rates, with or without arrestin, were determined at 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 °C (pH 7.5), and the average of two independent experiments was used to derive the activation energy (Ea) of these events using the Arrhenius equation, k = Ae-Ea/(RT). The pH dependence of retinal and arrestin release was determined by mixing the phosphorylated rhodopsin and arrestin into buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl) at pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, or 8.5. Rates were determined as described above (35 °C). EPR—Arrestin I72C and S251C were prepared for EPR in an identical manner as described for monobromobimane labeling, except that a 5-fold molar excess of nitroxide spin label was used during labeling. The EPR spectrum of a sample of WT arrestin, labeled using identical conditions, showed less than 10% incorporation of spin label at the native cysteines compared with I72C. For EPR measurements, a 6-μl volume of 50 μm spin-labeled arrestin and 200 μm ROS-P were measured in the dark at room temperature (19–21 °C) and at various time points following photoactivation (45 s using a 150-watt >495-nm fiber optic light source). To assess whether the observed spectral changes were due to changes in protein rotational rates, EPR spectra were also measured in the presence of 20% Ficoll 400 (21Frazier A.A. Wisner M.A. Malmberg N.J. Victor K.G. Fanucci G.E. Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6282-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Ficoll concentrations higher than 20% could not be used, since they caused arrestin precipitation. EPR measurements were made using a Varian E-104 instrument fitted with a loop-gap resonator and the EWWIN 5.22 data acquisition package (Scientific Software Services, Plymouth, MI). Measurements were carried out at ∼9.3-GHz microwave frequency, using 2-milliwatt incident microwave power, a modulation amplitude of ∼2 gauss, and a 100-gauss sweep (29 s/scan). Multiple scans were taken and averaged where appropriate (see the legend to Fig. 7 for details). Numerous studies suggest the two concave surfaces of arrestin are involved in binding light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin (5Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 105-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 9Smith W.C. Dinculescu A. Peterson J.J. McDowell J.H. Mol.

In the present study, we introduced two cysteine residues between these surfaces and labeled them with the cysteine-specific fluorescent probe monobromobimane (Fig. 1). We and others have extensively characterized bimane and found that it can reliably report on protein dynamics and structure due to its small size, its sensitivity to polarity, and its ability to be quenched by nearby tryptophan and tyrosine residues (15Mansoor S.E. McHaourab H.S. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16383-16393Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Giniger R. Huppert D. Kosower E.M. Chem. Phys.

Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Below, we report our studies on the bimane-labeled arrestin mutants I72C and S251C. Fluorescently Labeled Arrestin Mutants Are Functional— The relative functionality of the mutants with and without the bimane label was first assessed using a centrifugal “pull-down” assay (Fig. 2). Mutant I72C shows proper binding specificity to ROS*-P but binds ROS*-P with less affinity (43% of WT). Interestingly, bimane labeling of I72C (I72B) appears to restore the binding ability of this mutant to ∼99% of WT levels. Both unlabeled arrestin S251C and labeled S251B bind to similar levels as WT (89 and 101%, respectively). Spectral Properties of Labeled Arrestin Mutants—Both I72B and S251B fluoresce with a λmaxof ∼470 nm, and their spectra do not change in the presence of an excess of dark ROS-P. However, upon photoactivation, the emission spectrum of arrestin I72B blue-shifts to a λmax of 456 nm and increases in total integrated intensity by ∼12% (Fig. 3A). The fluorescence of arrestin S251B increases ∼100% upon photoactivation but displays no shift in its λmax (Fig. 3D). Importantly, these changes are not observed using nonphosphorylated ROS (Fig. 3, B and E) and are abolished by 50 mm hydroxylamine (data not shown), presumably because hydroxylamine catalyzes the decay of activated rhodopsin by cleaving the retinal Schiff base. Spectral Changes Require Interaction with Rhodopsin—We next assessed whether the observed spectral changes were due to conformational changes within arrestin itself rather than interactions with ROS*-P. To do this, we tested the effect of phosphopeptide 7PP, which represents the fully phosphorylated form of rhodopsin's C-terminal tail and has been shown to transactivate arrestin to bind nonphosphorylated ROS* (13Puig J. Arendt A. Tomson F.L. Abdulaeva G. Miller R. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The peptide 7PP causes an ∼20% decrease in intensity for mutant I72B (Fig. 3C) and induces no change in arrestin S251B (Fig. 3F). We obtained similar results as for 7PP using heparin and phytic acid, two polyanionic compounds that have been reported to bind arrestin and induce activating conformational changes (data not shown) (20Wilson C.J. Copeland R.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Palczewski K. Pulvermuller A. Buczylko J. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence Lifetime Analysis—To further elucidate the cause of these spectral changes, we measured the fluorescent decay lifetimes of I72B and S251B under different conditions (Table I). The fluorescence lifetime (τ) of I72B is 11.1 ns, and this value is shortened slightly by the phosphopeptide 7PP (10.6 ns). In the presence of ROS-P, the τ shortens by ∼1 ns after photoactivation but reverts to ∼10.5 ns after the addition of hydroxylamine. These values are all similar to free bimane (9.1 ± 0.1 ns; data not shown), s"

This is shown in situ during heat treatments at gradually increasing temperatures by scattering of synchrotron radiation in coherent Mo/V multilayers containing initially diffuse interfaces.

https://openalex.org/W2134052958,"Mesangial cell proliferation is a significant event in the development of progressive glomerular injuries. However, the issue of how cell proliferation is involved in the development of glomerulosclerosis is unclear. Recently, we showed that the overexpression of type IV collagen (Col IV), a major component of mesangial extracellular matrix, is transcriptionally regulated by Smad1 in diabetic glomerulosclerosis. In this study, we have demonstrated the effect of the administration of an anti-platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) beta-receptor antibody (APB5) blocking activation by the PDGF-B chain on rat glomerulonephritis and have examined the signaling pathways that regulate both glomerular cell proliferation and glomerulosclerosis in vivo and in vitro. Experimental mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (Thy1 GN) was induced by a single intravenous injection of anti-rat Thy-1.1 monoclonal antibody. In Thy1 GN, mesangial cell proliferation and the expression of Col IV peaked at day 6. Immunohistochemical staining for the expression of Smad1, phospho-Smad1 (pSmad1), and phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3) revealed that the peak for glomerular Smad1 expression occurred at day 6, consistent with the peak for mesangial proliferation. The expression of pSmad1 was up-regulated at day 1, and the peak for glomerular pSmad1 expression occurred at day 4 of the disease. When treated with APB5, both mesangial proliferation and sclerosis were reduced significantly. The expression of Smad1, pSmad1, and pSTAT3 was also significantly reduced by the administration of APB5. PDGF induced both mesangial cell replication and Col IV synthesis in association with an increased expression of pSTAT3 and pSmad1 on cultured mesangial cells. In addition, APB5 reduced mesangial cell proliferation in association with decreased pSmad1, pSTAT3, and Col IV protein expressions in vitro. The introduction of dominant negative STAT3 significantly decreased the expression of Col IV in cultured mesangial cells. These data suggest that the activation of STAT3 and Smad1 participates in the developing process of glomerulosclerosis in experimental glomerulonephritis."

Fission yeast lacking the catalytic subunit of telomerase (trt1+) up-regulate the expression of a previously uncharacterized sub-telomeric open reading frame as survivors emerge from crisis. Here we show that this open reading frame encodes a protein with homology to RecQ helicases such as the human Bloom's and Werner's syndrome proteins and that copies of the helicase gene are present on multiple chromosome ends. Characterization of the helicase transcript revealed a 7.6-kilobase RNA that was associated with polyribosomes, suggesting it is translated. A 3.6-kilobase domain of the helicase gene predicted to encode the region with catalytic activity was cloned, and both native and mutant forms of this domain were overexpressed in trt1– cells as they progressed through crisis. Overexpression of the native form caused cells to recover from crisis earlier than cells with a vector-only control, whereas overexpression of the mutant form caused delayed recovery from crisis. Taken together, the sequence homology, functional analysis, and site-directed mutagenesis indicate that the protein is likely a second fission yeast RecQ helicase (in addition to Rqh1) that participates in telomere metabolism during crisis.

These results strengthen the notion that in multiple organisms RecQ helicases contribute to survival after telomere damage. The RecQ family of helicases is conserved from prokaryotes to humans and contributes to such critical functions as genomic stability and repair of stalled replication forks (1Bachrati C.Z.

WRN, and RECQ4, cause Bloom's syndrome, Werner's syndrome, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, respectively (for review, see Ref. 1Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Symptoms include premature aging of the skin, vasculature, and bone in Werner's syndrome and short stature and limited premature aging in Bloom's syndrome. All three disorders are associated with an increased predisposition to cancer. Unicellular organisms such as yeast typically express a single RecQ homolog, such as Sgs1 in budding yeast and Rqh1 in fission yeast. RecQ proteins share a helicase domain with seven highly conserved motifs (I, Ia, II-VI) (3Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Regions that vary both in size and in sequence may flank the helicase domain, but little sequence similarity exists beyond these motifs (4Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). All characterized RecQ helicases can unwind DNA in an ATP-dependent manner in the 3′ to 5′ direction in relation to the DNA strand to which the enzyme is bound. WRN and BLM cannot bind to and unwind blunt-ended B-form DNA but require a single-stranded binding site, such as a 3′ overhang, to initiate unwinding of duplex DNA (5Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. R. M. Jr., Brosh Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RecQ helicases are apparently unique among helicases in their ability to unwind different forms of G-quadruplexes (5Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. R. M. Jr., Brosh Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D.

Additionally, WRN can resolve intramolecular D loops that likely form at telomeres (10Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T.

Telomeric DNA generally consists of a simple, repeated sequence with a G-rich strand running 5′ to 3′ toward the chromosome end, and it terminates with a single-stranded 3′ overhang (for review, see Refs. 12Tham W.H. Zakian V.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 512-521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 13Greider C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). In most eukaryotes, this telomeric DNA is synthesized by the enzyme telomerase, a reverse transcriptase consisting of an RNA subunit, a catalytic protein (encoded by trt1+ in Schizosaccharomyces pombe), and additional protein subunits (14McEachern M.J. Krauskopf A. Blackburn E.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Telomerase adds sequence complementary to its internal RNA template to chromosome ends. In the absence of telomerase cells lose telomeric DNA and eventually senesce when cell division ceases. However, rare cells can emerge from senescence and continue to divide indefinitely using alternate telomere maintenance mechanisms. Telomerase-independent telomere maintenance occurs in cancerous human ALT cells and in both budding and fission yeast lacking telomerase (15Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Gupta J. Bacchetti S. Reddel R.R.

The budding yeast RecQ helicase Sgs1 functions in the Rad50/Rad52 recombination pathway for telomerase-independent telomere maintenance and is required for telomere elongation of type II survivors (23Huang P.

Likewise, the observation that Werner's syndrome cells, which do not normally express telomerase, display accelerated telomere erosion and premature senescence (26Schulz V.P. Zakian V.A. Ogburn C.E.

A previously uncharacterized ORF annotated as a putative helicase had virtually no expression in wild-type cells but had substantially increased expression in survivors emerging from crisis. Strikingly, it was the only gene identified to have altered expression at such a late time in the recovery from loss of telomerase. This putative helicase has sequenced copies (SPAC212.11 and SPBCPT2R1.08c) on two sub-telomeres and in one case is only ∼10 kb from the telomeric repeats (28Mandell J.G. Ba ̈hler J. Volpe T.A. Martienssen R.A. Cech T.R. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: RI.1-RI.15Crossref Google Scholar). On the basis of a homology search we hypothesized that these genes encode a new member of the RecQ helicase family and contribute to fission yeast telomerase-independent telomere maintenance. Here we show that this putative helicase has significant homology to RecQ helicases and that copies of the helicase reside on all four sub-telomeres of chromosomes I and II. Furthermore, cells overexpressing a domain of this helicase exit from crisis sooner than controls, whereas cells overexpressing a catalytically inactive form of the helicase have a delayed exit from crisis. Gene Annotations—Sequences and other annotations were taken from S. pombe GeneDB (www.genedb.org/genedb/pombe/index.jsp) and the S. pombe Genome Project (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_pombe). Unless otherwise stated, helicase amino acid and base numbering refer to the annotated record for SPAC212.11. Differences between the Two Helicase Copies in Data Base—The data base (GeneDB) contains two copies of a sub-telomeric ORF annotated as a putative helicase, SPAC212.11 (5.6 kb) and SPBCPT2R1.08c (6.3 kb), residing on the left arm of chromosome I and the right arm of chromosome II, respectively. The annotated sequence of SPBCPT2R1.08c includes the entirety of SPAC212.11 with one silent base substitution, resulting in identical predicted protein sequences over the entire length of SPAC212.11. The size difference between the two ORFs (∼700 bp) reflects additional 5′ and 3′ sequence in SPBCPT2R1.08c, well outside of the predicted helicase domain. The extra 5′ sequence is due to a predicted start codon that is located 543 bp upstream with respect to the predicted SPAC212.11 start codon. The SPAC212.11 sequence has five base changes or deletions in this 5′ region that introduce stop codons. The additional 3′ sequence in SPBCPT2R1.08c results from a premature end to the SPAC212 sequencing contig, resulting in the lack of a stop codon for SPAC212.11. Comparison with the SPBCPT2R1.08c sequence suggests SPAC212.11 has an additional 95 bp before its stop codon. Because the data base entries for these two ORFs are essentially identical throughout the predicted helicase domain and flanking regions, references to the SPAC212.11 ORF are equally applicable to the SPBCPT2R1.08c ORF. It is not known whether one or both of these ORFs are transcribed, although results presented here indicate the existence of only a single transcript species. RACE, Gene Cloning, and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Whole cell RNA (1 μg) prepared as described (28Mandell J.G. Ba ̈hler J. Volpe T.A. Martienssen R.A. Cech T.R. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: RI.1-RI.15Crossref Google Scholar) from strain H1 (see “Plasmids and Strains,” this section) was used to create a 5′ RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends)-ready cDNA library using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. 5′ RACE was performed using the gene-specific primer 5′-GTACTGGTAGTCCTCTGATGTATGGG-3′ and the SMART II A oligonucleotide, and 3′ RACE was performed with the gene-specific primer 5′-ATGCCCCGTACGCTTATCTA-3′ and oligo-dT18. Gene-specific primers were chosen on the basis of their proximity to the annotated ends of SPAC212.11. Ten clones were chosen from each RACE reaction and sequenced to establish a consensus. Using primers derived from 5′ and 3′ RACE sequencing results, end-to-end PCR was performed with the 5′ primer 5′-AACGACACCGGACAGTCGGGAACAACGTTTGC-3′ and the 3′ primer 5′-CATTGATGCATATTTCAGCTTTATTTTCATTTCATTCG-3′ (named helicase-end). The helicase domain (from the codon specifying methionine 804 in SPAC212.11 to the end of the cDNA as determined by 3′ RACE) was amplified by PCR from the RACE cDNA library using gene-specific primers 5′-ATGTCTAAGAAGGATCTGACAAAGTTGTTTGGTGG-3′ (named helicase-start) and helicase-end (see above), with a BamHI site on the 5′ end of helicase-start and a SacI site on the 5′ end of helicase-end (endonuclease sequences not shown). The resulting 3.6-kb fragment (henceforth referred to as the “native” form of the helicase) was cloned into the BamHI and SacI sites of vector pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced to confirm the absence of mutations. All helicase-cloning steps were performed using GeneHogs Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen). The double mutation K1219M::D1322N was introduced to render the helicase catalytically inactive. Mutations were performed sequentially using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were confirmed by sequencing. To assess protein expression levels, a FLAG tag with amino acid sequence DYKDDDDK (31Brizzard B.L. Chubet R.G. Vizard D.L. Biotechniques. 1994; 16: 730-735PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted using PCR just after the start codon in both the native and mutant forms of the helicase. The resulting PCR fragment with BamHI and SacI ends was subcloned into expression vector pART1-KanMX6 (described below in “Plasmids and Strains,” this section). Plasmids and Strains—Plasmid pART1 (32McLeod M. Stein M. Beach D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) was chosen as a base plasmid because of its constitutive fission yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) promoter (33Broker M. Bauml O. FEBS Lett. 1989; 248: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The LEU2 marker of pART1 is flanked by HindIII sites and was removed by digestion, resulting in plasmid pART1-LEU2. The 1460-bp KanMX6 cassette (34Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR from plasmid pKan1 (35Haering C.H. Nakamura T.M. Baumann P. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6367-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using primers designed to incorporate AatII ends and to disrupt the terminal SacI cloning site with the base change T to A. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into the single AatII site of pART1-LEU2, creating plasmid pART1-KanMX6. The directionality of the KanMX6 cassette was not determined. FLAG-helicase fusion fragments with 5′-BamHI and 3′-SacI ends (described above) were cloned into the unique BamHI and SacI sites of pART1-KanMX6. The three plasmids used in this study were pART1-KanMX6 (“vector-only”) and pART1-KanMX6 with either the native or mutant helicase sequence following the adh (alcohol dehydrogenase) promoter. Plasmids were transformed into either diploid strain G4 (h–/h+ade6-M210/ade6-M216 trt1+/trt1–) (28Mandell J.G. Ba ̈hler J. Volpe T.A. Martienssen R.A. Cech T.R. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: RI.1-RI.15Crossref Google Scholar) or wild-type strain WT-5 (h–ade6-M210) (28Mandell J.G. Ba ̈hler J. Volpe T.A. Martienssen R.A. Cech T.R. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: RI.1-RI.15Crossref Google Scholar) using the lithium acetate method (36Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 95-98Google Scholar). After transformation cells were grown in the presence of Geneticin disulfate (Sigma) at 100 μg/ml to maintain selective pressure for plasmids. Single colonies resulting from transformations were chosen and propagated. As described previously (28Mandell J.G. Ba ̈hler J. Volpe T.A. Martienssen R.A. Cech T.R. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: RI.1-RI.15Crossref Google Scholar), diploid strains were germinated to generate haploid cells that were subsequently screened for the genotype (h–ade6-M210) and the presence or absence of trt1+ and used in growth curves (described below in “Growth Curves,” this section). Growth curves with wild-type cells (Fig. 5) were performed with transformants from strain WT-5, whereas growth curves in Figs. 6 and 7 were carried out with transformants derived from strain G4.Fig. 6Native helicase overexpression in trt1– cells.A, as in Fig. 5, except trt1– cells were used in 10-ml cultures.

Ba ̈hler J. Volpe T.A. Martienssen R.A. Cech T.R. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: RI.1-RI.15Crossref Google Scholar). Strain H1 constitutively expresses abundant helicase transcript as determined by microarray (data not shown), reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown), and Northern blotting (Fig. 3C). Alignments—Amino acid alignment was performed with ClustalW Version 1.81 (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55720) Google Scholar) using the Blosum30 weight matrix, a gap open penalty of 10, and a gap extension penalty of 0.05. Polysome Profiles—Polysome profiles were performed with extract from strains WT 5 (trt1+) and H1 (trt1–) (28Mandell J.G. Ba ̈hler J. Volpe T.A. Martienssen R.A. Cech T.R. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: RI.1-RI.15Crossref Google Scholar) essentially as described (38Bandyopadhyay A. Matsumoto T. Maitra U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4005-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to a density of ∼4.5 × 106 cells/ml in yeast extract full supplements (YES) medium (39Baumann P. Cech T.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3265-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and cycloheximide (Sigma) was added (100 μg/ml) 5 min before harvest. Cells (∼10 × 108) were washed twice in LHB buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, and 100 μg/ml cycloheximide) (38Bandyopadhyay A. Matsumoto T. Maitra U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4005-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and lysed using 425–600-μm glass beads (Sigma) and two 30-s bursts at full speed in a FastPrep Instrument (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). Extract (200 μl) containing ∼60 A260 absorbance units was fractionated through a 7–47% sucrose gradient as described (38Bandyopadhyay A. Matsumoto T. Maitra U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4005-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Fractions were treated with proteinase K (0.2 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min, and RNA was extracted with acidic phenol:chloroform (Sigma) followed by chloroform and then ethanol-precipitated. The 80 S subunit was identified by comparison with a polysome profile performed in the presence of 15 mm EDTA to partially dissociate the 80 S subunit. Northern Hybridizations—RNA was quantified by A260, and samples were subjected to denaturing formaldehyde gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel as described (40Brown T. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 4.9.1-4.9.14Google Scholar). After transfer of RNA to a positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond-N+ membrane, Amersham Biosciences) by capillary transfer and immobilization by UV cross-linking (40Brown T. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 4.9.1-4.9.14Google Scholar), regions of the membrane containing molecular weight markers (RNA ladder (New England Biolabs) and/or 10 μg of total S. pombe RNA for the ribosomal RNA bands) were cut off and stained with methylene blue (0.04%). Probes for act1+, P5′ and P3′ (sequences described in Ref. 28Mandell J.G. Ba ̈hler J. Volpe T.A. Martienssen R.A. Cech T.R. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: RI.1-RI.15Crossref Google Scholar) were generated by PCR amplification from a genomic DNA template and were gel-purified. Probes were labeled by random-primed transcription of PCR products with the use of [α-32P]dCTP and High Prime Mix (Roche Applied Science). Hybridizations were carried out in Church-Gilbert buffer at 50 °C (41Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar) with ∼1 × 107 cpm of probe. The membrane was washed in 0.1% SDS and 0.1% SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) after hybridization and imaged using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). For subsequent re-probing of the blot, hybridized probe was removed by washing the membrane 3 × 10 min in stripping buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 0.1× SSC) at 80 °C and exposing the membrane overnight to confirm removal of signal. Immunoblotting—Single colonies from transformed wild-type strain WT-5 were grown at 32 °C in 12 ml of YES medium with Geneticin to a density of ∼2 × 107 cells/ml. Protein was prepared as described previously (35Haering C.H. Nakamura T.M. Baumann P. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6367-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), except that cells were lysed using three 30-s bursts at full speed in a FastPrep Instrument. Total protein concentration was determined by Bradford Assay (Pierce), and ∼50 μg of protein per lane was loaded onto a 4–20% Tris-glycine Novex gel (Invitrogen). Protein was transferred to a ZetaBind positively charged nylon membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membrane was first probed with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) used at a 1:1000 dilution followed by goat anti-mouse antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) used at a 1:4000 dilution. Protein bands were visualized with the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Growth Curves—Growth curves were performed essentially as described (28Mandell J.G. Ba ̈hler J. Volpe T.A. Martienssen R.A. Cech T.R. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: RI.1-RI.15Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, single colonies were used to inoculate 5-ml starter cultures in YES medium (with Geneticin at 100 μg/ml when appropriate) and grown for 24 h with shaking at 32 °C. Cells were counted and used to inoculate YES cultures (either 100 ml in 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks or 10 ml in 50-ml tubes) at 5.0 × 104 cells/ml. At the end of every 24-h period, cells were counted and used to inoculate fresh cultures at 5.0 × 104 cells/ml, and the process was repeated for 15 days. A portion of cells from 100-ml cultures was set aside for analysis by Southern blotting. Where noted, biological repeats (n = 2) were treated identically but were started from separate single colonies. When the repeats were similar, the data points were averaged and are displayed with error bars that span the range of averaged values. Homology with RecQ Helicases—The data base (GeneDB) contains two copies of the putative helicase genes (SPAC212.11 and SPBCPT2R1.08c) with nearly identical helicase coding DNA sequences (see “Experimental Procedures” for differences between the two ORFs). A BLAST search performed with the predicted protein sequence of SPAC212.11 indicated that the most significant homology is with RecQ DNA helicases of Superfamily II (BLAST Expect value = 5 × 10–112) (for review, see Ref. 1Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This homology was significant for residues ∼1180 to ∼1820 (including the RecQ and associated RecQ family C-terminal (RQC) and helicase RNase D C-terminal (HRDC) domains; see below). SPAC212.11 was also classified with other RecQ helicases in the NCBI Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) data base (42Tatusov R.L. Natale D.A. Garkavtsev I.V. Tatusova T.A. Shankavaram U.T. Rao B.S. Kiryutin B. Galperin M.Y. Fedorova N.D. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). Note that significant homologies (E ∼ 1 × 10–25) to other helicase families were also found, preventing an unequivocal assignment to a particular family. A subset of relevant human and yeast RecQ orthologs was chosen, and the protein sequences were aligned with SPAC212.11. In all cases, the alignment was highly significant (E ≤ 7 × 10–18) (Fig. 1A). A schematic alignment of the orthologs on the basis of their RecQ helicase domains also indicated sim"

How GCN5 gains entry into the nucleus of the cell has not been determined. We have mapped a six-amino acid motif (RKRVKR) that serves as a necessary and sufficient nuclear localization signal (NLS) for GCN5 in the protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii (TgGCN5). Virtually nothing is known about nucleocytoplasmic transport in these parasites (phylum Apicomplexa), and this study marks the first demonstrated NLS delineated for members of the phylum. The TgGCN5 NLS has predictive value because it successfully identifies other nuclear proteins in three different apicomplexan genomic databases. Given the basic composition of the T. gondii NLS, we hypothesized that TgGCN5 physically interacts with importin-α, the main transport receptor in the importin/karyopherin nuclear import pathway. We cloned the importin-α gene from T. gondii (TgIMPα), which encodes a protein of 545 amino acids that possesses an importin-β-binding domain and armadillo/β-catenin-like repeats. In vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirm that TgIMPα directly interacts with TgGCN5, but this interaction is abolished if the TgGCN5 NLS is deleted. Taken together, these data argue that TgGCN5 gains access to the parasite nucleus by interacting with TgIMPα.

This study demonstrates the utility of T. gondii as a model for the study of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking in early eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic DNA is highly compacted in chromatin, which is largely comprised of histone proteins. Once thought to play only a scaffolding role, histones are now recognized as a critical component of gene regulation and epigenetic inheritance. Many chromatin remodeling complexes contain histone-modifying enzymes that alter the nucleosomal structure and modulate the expressed genome (1Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar, 2Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). GCN5, originally described as a transcriptional adapter in yeast (3Georgakopoulos T. Thireos G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4145-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), was later discovered to be a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; NLS, nuclear localization signal; βgal, β-galactosidase; contig, group of overlapping clones.1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; NLS, nuclear localization signal; βgal, β-galactosidase; contig, group of overlapping clones.

HATs covalently modify chromatin by acetylating specific lysine residues within the N-terminal tails of histones, thereby attenuating the nucleosome-DNA interaction. GCN5 and the related HAT, P/CAF (p300/CBP-associating factor), are critical for growth and development in mice (5Yamauchi T. Yamauchi J. Kuwata T. Tamura T. Yamashita T. Bae N. Westphal H. Ozato K.

Genet. 2000; 26: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and plants (7Vlachonasios K.E. Thomashow M.F. Triezenberg S.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although much study has been invested in the gene regulatory functions of GCN5s, little attention has been directed at resolving how the HAT gets into the cell nucleus. One study suggests that P/CAF requires importin-α for nuclear localization, but the precise mechanism of the interaction was not determined (8Kohler M. Speck C. Christiansen M. Bischoff F.R. Prehn S. Haller H. Gorlich D. Hartmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7782-7791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importin-α proteins serve as adaptors that bind both the nuclear-destined cargo protein and importin-β. Importin-α recognizes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) on the cargo, which is typically a mono- or bi-partite cluster of basic amino acids (9Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar). Importin-β is capable of binding nucleoporins, thus escorting the importin-α-importin-β-cargo complex to the nuclear pore. RanGDP and nuclear transport factor 2 are involved in translocation of the ternary complex through the nuclear pore, whereupon RCC1 exchanges GDP with GTP to dissociate the cargo (10Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 11Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). RanGTP recycles importin-β, and importin-α is exported back to the cytoplasm by a distinct importin-β homologue, cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein (12Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Gorlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Exceptions exist to this generalized pathway, such as the ability of importin-β to translocate cargo without importin-α (13Palmeri D. Malim M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1218-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the presence of transportin, a distant relative of importin-β that recognizes nonclassical (M9) NLSs (14Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The GCN5 HAT identified in the protozoal parasite Toxoplasma gondii (phylum Apicomplexa) revealed unexpected features, most notably an N-terminal “extension” that is unusually long (820 amino acids) for an early eukaryote (15Sullivan Jr., W.J. Smith II, C.K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Early eukaryotes including yeast and the fellow alveolate protist Tetrahymena possess a short N-terminal domain of <100 residues (4Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). The N-terminal extension in plant GCN5s range from 150 to 250 amino acids and have little homology to each other or other HATs (16Bhat R.A. Riehl M. Santandrea G. Velasco R. Slocombe S. Donn G. Steinbiss H.H. Thompson R.D. Becker H.A. Plant J. 2003; 33: 455-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Metazoan GCN5 family members contain N-terminal extensions of ∼500 residues, and they are fairly similar in composition (17Smith E.R. Belote J.M. Schiltz R.L. Yang X.J. Moore P.A. Berger S.L. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2948-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Xu W. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5659-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). TgGCN5 contains the second longest N-terminal extension of all GCN5 HATs described to date, the longest (1126 amino acids) having recently been noted in another apicomplexan, Plasmodium falciparum (19Fan Q.

Interestingly, the lengthy N-terminal extensions present in these apicomplexan GCN5s bear no similarity to each other or any known protein and are devoid of known protein motifs. We hypothesized that at least one role for the N-terminal extension may be nuclear localization. Consistent with this hypothesis is the recent observation that maize GCN5 needs its N-terminal extension to access the nucleus; however, the precise NLS was not mapped (16Bhat R.A. Riehl M. Santandrea G. Velasco R. Slocombe S. Donn G. Steinbiss H.H. Thompson R.D. Becker H.A. Plant J. 2003; 33: 455-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Understanding GCN5 and how it enters the parasite nucleus is significant for a number of reasons. T. gondii can cause congenital birth defects and is an important opportunistic pathogen in AIDS and immunosuppressed patients (20Hermanns B. Brunn A. Schwarz E.R. Sachweh J.S. Seipelt I.

Blocking transcription factors from entering the parasite nucleus will subvert parasite differentiation and other processes essential for its survival. Novel elements found in parasite transcription factors and/or the nuclear import pathway may be exploited in the design of more selective therapeutic agents. Additionally, the study of these pathways in protozoa provides a unique perspective on how these systems evolved in early eukaryotic cells. Here we report the use of T. gondii GCN5 (TgGCN5) as a tool to investigate the understudied area of nuclear trafficking in protozoan parasites. We have mapped the first NLS to be identified and validated for any apicomplexan protein and in the process defined a function of the long N-terminal extension of TgGCN5. We demonstrate the predictive value of this NLS by identifying other nuclear proteins from the T. gondii genome as well as two additional apicomplexan databases. We have also characterized a T. gondii importin-α orthologue (TgIMPα) and demonstrated that this nuclear receptor interacts with TgGCN5 via the NLS that we have elucidated. Knowledge that GCN5 family HATs are translocated to the nucleus by the importin pathway may be useful in developing therapies that prevent this factor from modulating transcription in eukaryotic cells. Parasite Culture and Methods—T. gondii tachyzoites were cultivated in human foreskin fibroblast cells and transfected by electroporation as previously described (23Roos D.S. Sullivan W.J. Striepen B. Bohne W. Donald R.G. Methods. 1997; 13: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The RHΔHXGPRT clone and pminiHXGPRT vector were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, from Dr. David Roos (24Pfefferkorn E.R. Borotz S.E. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.

Mycophenolic acid at 25 μg/ml plus xanthine at 50 μg/ml (Sigma) were used to select for parasites transfected with pminiHXGPRT-derived vectors. Plasmids—All of the constructs for immunolocalization were based on a T. gondii expression vector that was built into pminiHXGPRT. The T. gondii TUB1 promoter was amplified from ptubP30-GFP/sagCAT (27Striepen B. He C.Y. Matrajt M. Soldati D. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) using primers 1 and 2 (all of the primer sequences are listed in Table I). These primers incorporate a BamHI site on the 5′ end of the PCR product and a polylinker region at the 3′ end containing sites for BglII, NdeI, EcoRV, and AvrII. The 3′-untranslated region of T. gondii dihydrofolate reductase was amplified using these primers 3 and 4. The resulting PCR product contained AvrII and NotI sites that were digested for a three-piece ligation with the TUB1 amplicon above (cut with BamHI and AvrII) and the pminiHXGPRT vector (cut with BamHI and NotI). We have designated this expression construct as ptubXFLAG::HX, the X representing where the gene of interest is to be installed (Fig. 1). It is important to note that although a C-terminal FLAG tag option is available in this vector, it was used only for the βgal construct. An N-terminal FLAG tag was fused to TgGCN5 sequences to be tested for localization as outlined below.Table IPrimers used in PCRs detailed under “Experimental Procedures” F denotes FLAG epitope tag sequence (5′-GACTACAAGGACGACGACGACAAG).NumberPrimer sequence (5′-3′)1GGATCCACACACTTCGTGCAGCATGTGCCCC2CCTAGGATATCATATGAGATCTAAAAGGGAATTCAAGAAAAAATGCC3CCTAGG(F)GAAGCTGCCCGTCTCTCGTTTTCC4TGGCGGCCGCTCTAGACCTAGTGGATCG5CATATGAAAATG(F)GAGACTGTCGAAGTGCCTGCATTCCTCG6CATATGAAAATG(F)AAAGGCGCTCCAACAGGTCTGGGG7CATATGAAAATG(F)AGGAAGCGTGTGAAGCGCGAGTGGGC8CATATGAAAATG(F)GAGTGGGCAAGTGGAGGTCGACTGGAGC9AGATCTAAAATGGTCGTTTTACAACGTCGTGACTGG10AGATCTAAAATGAGGAAGCGTGTGAAGCGCGTCGTTTTACAACGTCGTGA11CCTAGGTCAGAAACTCCCGAGAGCCTCGACC12CATATGGAGACTGTCGAAGTGCCTGCATTCCTCG13CATATGGAGTGGGCAAGTGGAGGTCGACTGG14CCCGGGTCAGAAACTCCCGAGAGCCTCGACCTTGG15GCTAGCGCTCTGTCCGCTGTCTCCATCCCTTGACG16GCTAGCGAGTGGGCAAGTGGAGGTCGACTGGAGC17CATATGGAGCGCAAGTTGGCCGATCGTCGATCG18CCCGGGCTACTGGCCGAAGTTGAAGCCTCCCTGAGG Open table in a new tab Primers 5–10 are the sense primers used in conjunction with the antisense primer 11 to create the various FLAG-tagged forms of TgGCN5 or βgal. All of the inserts were ligated into ptubXFLAG::HX at the NdeI and AvrII sites except the βgal constructs, which used BlgII and AvrII. Prior to electroporation, ∼50 μg of plasmid DNA was linearized using NotI. For the production of in vitro translated protein, pGADT7 and pGBKT7 vectors were used (Clontech). Full-length TgGCN5 and TgGCN5 lacking the first 99 amino acids (Δ99TgGCN5) were ligated into the pGBKT7 vector using the NdeI and XmaI sites. Sense primers 12 and 13 were used with antisense primer 14 to amplify inserts encoding full-length TgGCN5 and Δ99TgGCN5, respectively. ΔNLS-TgGCN5 was generated by a ligation of three DNA fragments. (i) The first piece encoded TgGCN5 amino acids 1–93 and was amplified using the primer 12 and 15, the latter of which contains a NheI site. (ii) The second fragment encoded amino acids 100–1169 and was generated with primer 16 (contains a NheI site) and primer 14 (contains a XmaI site). (iii) The third piece was pGBKT7 digested with NdeI and XmaI. The resulting vector encodes a form of TgGCN5 in which RKRVKR is replaced by AS (encoded by the NheI site). TgIMPα was ligated into pGADT7 in frame with the N-terminal hemagglutinin tag using NdeI and XmaI sites, and the insert was generated by PCR using the primers 17 and 18. All of the PCRs were conducted with the proofreading DNA polymerase Pfu Ultra™ (Stratagene). DNA sequencing was performed at the Indiana University Biochemistry Biotechnology Facility (Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN). Molecular Methods—T. gondii mRNA was isolated from ∼2 × 108 tachyzoites using Poly(A)Pure™ (Ambion). Tachyzoites were allowed to completely lyse the host cell monolayer and were passed through a 3.0-μm filter to exclude residual host cell debris. mRNA was treated with DNase prior to Northern blotting, which was performed using standard methods (28Sambrook J. Russell D. Irwin N. Hanssen K. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). A cDNA-derived probe representing the final 2.3 kb of TgGCN5 was labeled with [32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using random primers and a Prime-A-Gene® kit (Promega). Reverse transcription-PCRs were carried out using the SuperScript II™ One-Step reverse transcription-PCR system (Invitrogen). The rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using an Invitrogen GeneRacer™ kit. Sequencing alignments and phylogeny trees (neighbor joining method) were generated using AlignX, a component of Vector NTI Advance 9.0 (Informax). Protein motif searches were performed using the Pfam data base (version 14.0; pfam.wustl.edu/) and/or PROSITE data base (version 18.35; us.expasy.org/prosite/). Immunofluorescence Assays—12-Well plates containing confluent human foreskin fibroblast cells grown on glass coverslips were infected with parasites. The cultures were fixed 18–24 h post-infection with ice-cold methanol at -20 °C for 10 min and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% Fraction-V bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 5% goat serum (Invitrogen), and 1% fish gelatin (Sigma) for 1 h at 25 °C. Polyclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma) was used at 1:1000 in 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 25 °C followed by anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) at 1:1000 in 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h in the dark at 25 °C. 4′,6′-Diamino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes) was used at 0.3 μm for 5 min in the dark at 25 °C. Coverslips were mounted using 50% glycerol containing Mowiol 4–88 (Calbiochem) and DABCO (Sigma) to retard photobleaching. The slides were viewed with a Leica DMLB scope with a 100× HCX Plan Apo oil immersion objective. The images were captured using a monochrome SPOT-RTSE (model 12) camera and Spot Diagnostic software 4.0.9 and pseudocolored using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. TgGCN5 Antisera—A PCR-derived fragment encoding a portion of the C-terminal end of TgGCN5 (amino acids 976–1169) was ligated into pET19b (Novagen) to create an in-frame fusion to the N-terminal polyhistidine tag. Following transfection into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli, recombinant protein was induced by adding 1.0 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C and purified by virtue of a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) under native conditions. The purified protein was used as antigen to produce polyclonal antisera in rabbit (Pocono Rabbit Farms & Laboratories, Canadensis, PA). The resulting antisera recognizes <0.1 μg of recombinant antigen at a dilution of 1:10000, whereas prebleed sera is nonreactive (data not shown). Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—In vitro translated proteins representing full-length TgGCN5, Δ99TgGCN5, ΔNLS-TgGCN5, and hemagglutinin-tagged TgIMPα were generated using the TnT® coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of Redivue™ l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) and RNase Out (Invitrogen). 50-μl reaction mixtures were assembled and incubated as described by manufacturer. Co-immunoprecipitations were performed using 20 μl of a TgGCN5-derived construct combined with 20 μl of TgIMPα and mixed at 25 °C for 1 h. 1 μl of TgGCN5 polyclonal antisera or 10 μl of polyclonal anti-hemagglutinin (Santa Cruz) was added and mixed for 1 h at 25 °C. 10 μl of EZ-View protein A-agarose slurry (Sigma) was applied, and the reaction mixture was allowed to incubate at 25 °C for 1 h. Agarose was washed five times with 200 μl of Buffer 1 and twice with 300 μl of Buffer 2 from the MatchMaker co-immunoprecipitation kit (Clontech). Bound proteins were eluted in NuPAGE loading dye containing 5.0% β-mercaptoethanol and resolved on NuPAGE Bis-Tris SDS gels (Invitrogen). The gels were fixed in an aqueous solution of 5% isopropanol and 5% glacial acetic acid overnight and rinsed in running distilled water for 1 h. The gels were incubated in Autoflour (National Diagnostics) for 2 h, dried, and processed for autoradiography. Full-length TgGCN5 Localizes to Parasite Nucleus—TgGCN5 was initially described as a 474-amino acid protein, as deduced from a 2.3-kb cDNA clone isolated from a library screen (29Hettmann C. Soldati D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4344-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our parallel cloning of TgGCN5 suggested that the open reading frame is much larger, encoding a protein of 1169 amino acids (15Sullivan Jr., W.J. Smith II, C.K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To verify the message length and determine whether alternatively spliced variants of TgGCN5 are produced, we performed Northern analysis. The probe used was a cDNA-derived sequence corresponding to the 2.3-kb portion previously reported, which is shared between both predicted transcripts. The result clarifies that only one transcript of ∼5.6 kb exists in T. gondii (Fig. 2). The size of the transcript is consistent with the longer version of the gene and predicts a 5′-untranslated region of 1.3 kb. To resolve the 5′ end of the TgGCN5 message, 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed. Two amplicons were produced, indicating transcriptional start sites at -1101 and -1316 nucleotides from our proposed translational start. The 215-nucleotide difference between the two putative transcriptional starts is not resolvable on the Northern. A recombinant version of the previously reported 474-amino acid version of TgGCN5 (corresponding to amino acids 697–1169 of full-length TgGCN5) fused to a c-Myc epitope accumulated in the parasite cytoplasm, an unexpected localization for a GCN5 family member HAT (29Hettmann C. Soldati D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4344-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To test whether the additional N-terminal sequence alters localization to the parasite nucleus, full-length TgGCN5 and a truncated version lacking the N-terminal extension (amino acids 1–697) tagged with a FLAG epitope were expressed in the parasites (FLAGTgGCN5 and flagΔNTTgGCN5, respectively). Immunofluorescence assays using anti-FLAG demonstrate that the N-terminal extension is indeed required for nuclear localization of TgGCN5 (Fig. 3). In addition to nuclear DNA, 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole also stains the 35-kb extrachromosal element housed in the apicoplast. We did not observe any form of TgGCN5 trafficking to the apicoplast organelle. Mapping the Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) of TgGCN5—Protein motif searches of the TgGCN5 sequence revealed a putative bipartite NLS at amino acid positions 488–505 (15Sullivan Jr., W.J. Smith II, C.K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, removal of this 18-amino acid motif from full-length TgGCN5 fused to a C-terminal green fluorescent protein tag did not subvert nuclear localization. 2W. J. Sullivan, Jr. and B. Striepen, unpublished observations. Therefore, a series of mapping constructs were designed to identify the region responsible for targeting TgGCN5 to the parasite nucleus. After several truncation studies (data not shown), the region involved in nuclear localization was narrowed to be between amino acids 58 and 120. Visual inspection of this region revealed a hexapeptide enriched with basic residues beginning at residue 94. NLSs often contain basic amino acids and average 6–8 residues in length (30Boulikas T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 32-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, FLAG-tagged TgGCN5 lacking the first 99 residues (FLAGΔ99TgGCN5) does not enter the parasite nucleus. However, when only the first 93 residues are removed (FLAGΔ93TgGCN5), the resulting protein is no longer restricted from the parasite nucleus. This demonstrates that the hexapeptide RKRVKR (amino acids 94–99) is required for the nuclear localization of TgGCN5. To verify whether the hexapeptide is a complete and sufficient NLS, RKRVRK was fused to the N terminus of E. coli βgal for expression in T. gondii. The FLAG epitope tag was moved to the C-terminal end of the βgal fusion proteins to ensure that the FLAG-NLS chimeric sequence was not responsible for nuclear localization. βgalFLAG is excluded from the parasite nucleus unless fused to the TgGCN5 NLS (Fig. 5). The homogenous staining of the parasites expressing NLS-βgal is likely due to saturation of the nuclear trafficking pathway or a strong nuclear export sequence present in βgal. Taken together, these studies show that RKRVKR is a necessary and sufficient NLS. Bioinformatics Screen for Proteins Harboring the TgGCN5 NLS—RKRVKR is a rare form of a monopartite NLS conforming to the θθθXθθ type described in Boulikas (30Boulikas T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 32-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), where θ denotes a lysine or arginine. With the recent completion of multiple apicomplexan genome sequencing projects, knowledge of NLS motifs would prove valuable in characterizing parasite genes of unknown function. Bioinformatics searches using the TgGCN5 NLS against predicted proteins in ToxoDB.org (Release 3.0) revealed no exact matches, save TgGCN5 itself. However, when RKRXKR is used, 25 potential hits emerged using the TgTigrScan set of predicted proteins (Table II). For example, TgTigrScan_3884 is undoubtedly a DNA polymerase and contains a similar motif, RKRTKR, which may contribute to its nuclear compartmentalization. TgTigrScan_2877, 5941, 6704, and 7743 and several more contain predicted zinc fingers that are indigenous to many nuclear transcription factors. TgTigrScan_4179 contains RKRKKR and is a probable nuclear ribonucleoprotein, harboring an RNA recognition motif. Although these predictions are encouraging, they remain to be confirmed in vivo. It is also worth mentioning that NLSs may be more a matter of charge than an orderly configuration of precise amino acid residues (31Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). Thus, permutations of the TgGCN5 NLS (e.g. (R/K)(R/K)X(R/K)(R/K)(R/K)) are likely to be found in other nuclear proteins in apicomplexa.Table IIPredictive value of the TgGCN5 NLS in apicomplexaDB identifierSearch resultPredicted homology/motifsToxoplasmaTgTigrScan_3884RKRTKRDNA polymerase X familyTgTigrScan_2877RKRDKRZinc fingerTgTigrScan_5941RKRGKRZinc fingerTgTigrScan_6704RKRMKRZinc fingerTgTigrScan_7743RKRRKRZinc fingerTgTigrScan_4179RKRKKRRNA recognition motifPlasmodiumPY07179KRKNKKHistone deacetylase domainPF10_0175RKKRKKtRNA pseudouridylate synthasePF10_0362KKKMKKDNA polymerase B familyPFC0425wRKRNKRPHD fingersCryptosporidiumCpEST_AA224688RKRNKRHistone 2BCpEST_AA253596KKKRRKPutative nucleolar protein Open table in a new tab T. gondii Possesses an Importin-α Homologue—Nuclear proteins harboring a NLS rich in basic residues typically interact with members of the importin (also known as karyopherin) family of proteins, particularly importin-α (30Boulikas T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 32-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 32Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The T. gondii database (Release 2.1) was screened for sequences encoding possible importin-α homologues using the BLAST algorithm and text queries. The contig Tgg_7395 (corresponding to Tgg_994532 in Release 3.0) exhibited a high degree of similarity to importin-α proteins from other species. Primers designed to the genomic sequence data were employed to obtain the fulllength cDNA for T. gondii importin-α (TgIMPα, AY267540). Based on the results of the cDNA sequence, we have deduced that the ∼9.5-kb TgIMPα genomic locus is comprised of 11 exons and 10 introns. TgIMPα possesses an open reading frame of 1638 nucleotides with a consensus start ATG (33Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar) that is preceded by an inframe stop codon -156 nucleotides upstream. The deduced 545-amino acid sequence has a calculated molecular mass of ∼60 kDa and shows unequivocal similarity to orthologues present in other eukaryotic organisms, especially the fellow apicomplexan parasite P. falciparum (34Mohmmed A.

Apicomplexan IMPα proteins harbor the well conserved importin-β-binding domain and armadillo/β-catenin-like repeats (35Herold A. Truant R. Wiegand H. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). Additionally, they contain the leucine-rich nuclear export signal within the final armadillo/β-catenin-like repeat that is required to recycle importin-α back to the cytoplasm (36Kobe B. Nat. Struct.

Cell Res. 1999; 250: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In cultured myofibroblasts, SMA expression is associated with the generation of increased contractile forces and stress fiber formation (12Hinz B. Mastrangelo D. Iselin C.E. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G.

Interference with SMA expression inhibits force generation and the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers (15Hinz B. Gabbiani G. Chaponnier C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In myofibroblasts, induction of SMA by TGF-β is dependent on the compliance of the substrate (16Arora P.D. Narani N. McCulloch C.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role for cell-generated tension in regulating gene expression (17Tomasek J.J. Gabbiani G. Hinz B. Chaponnier C. Brown R.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (3159) Google Scholar). SMA in myofibroblasts is largely assembled into actin filaments (15Hinz B. Gabbiani G. Chaponnier C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 18Chaponnier C. Goethals M. Janmey P.A. Gabbiani F. Gabbiani G. Vandekerckhove J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and some of these SMA filaments are localized to focal adhesions (19Dugina V. Fontao L. Chaponnier C. Vasiliev J. Gabbiani G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3285-3296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These are important observations because the transmission of tensile forces involved in the induction of force-regulated genes requires actin filaments (16Arora P.D. Narani N. McCulloch C.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 17Tomasek J.J. Gabbiani G. Hinz B. Chaponnier C. Brown R.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and focal adhesions are thought to function as mechanosensors (20Riveline D. Zamir E. Balaban N.Q. Schwarz U.S. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Kam Z. Geiger B. Bershadsky A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we hypothesized that specific actin isoforms such as SMA, when associated with focal adhesions, may provide a selective physical link by which mechanical forces induce specific patterns of gene expression. Currently, it is unknown if SMA can mediate mechanical signals such as force-induced activation of MAP kinases. In certain cell types, TGF-β-induced SMA expression is dependent on p38 activity (21Dugina V. Alexandrova A. Chaponnier C. Vasiliev J. Gabbiani G. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Force-induced regulation of SMA expression is also associated with p38 activation, depending on the extent of actin assembly in the specific types of cells examined (3Wang J. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2776-H2785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wang J. Chen H. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H1871-H1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As p38 activation is a prominent cellular response to applied tensile forces (2D'Addario M. Arora P.D. Fan J. Ganss B. Ellen R.P. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31969-31977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 3Wang J. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. Am. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47541-47550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we examined the role of SMA in mediating force-induced activation of p38, and conversely, we studied the importance of p38 in regulating force-induced SMA expression. Our data indicate that when tensile forces are applied to α2β1 integrins, phosphorylated p38 binds to SMA, and there are p38-dependent increases of SMA expression. As our results showed that cells with abundant SMA exhibit enhanced force-induced activation of p38, we suggest that SMA and p38 participate in a feed-forward amplification loop to synergize force-induced SMA expression with p38 phosphorylation. Reagents—Antibodies to α-smooth muscle actin (clone 1A4), β-actin (clone AC-15), total-actin (clone AC-40), vimentin (clone VIM-13.2), vinculin (clone hVIN-1), TRITC-phalloidin, TGF-β1, DNase I, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. Goat anti-mouse IgG2a, goat anti-mouse IgM, and goat anti-mouse IgG1 antibodies were purchased from Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Antibodies to p38α, p38δ, p38, ERK1/2, and JNK and the respective phospho-specific antibodies for each of these kinases were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (New England Biolabs, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Antibodies to p38β and p38γ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibody to GAPDH (clone 6C5) was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Soluble type I bovine collagen was obtained from Celltrix (Palo Alto, CA). The Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632, rat polyclonal antibodies to α1, α2, α3 integrins, DDR1 receptor, and mouse monoclonal antibody to the α2β1 integrin (clone PIE6) were purchased from Calbiochem. The Rho activation assay kit was purchased from Cytoskeleton, Inc. (Denver, CO). siRNA Preparation—We designed target-specific siRNA duplexes based on the sequence of the rat SMA gene. A 21-nucleotide SMA siRNA sequence relative to the start codon (876–896, accession number X06801) was submitted to a BLAST search against the rat genome sequence to ensure that only the SMA gene of the rat genome was targeted. An siRNA sequence (5′-GACGUAAACGGCCACAAGUUC-3′) for green fluorescent protein was synthesized as an irrelevant control. All siRNAs were produced by Qiagen. Cell Culture and Transfection for RNAi—Rat-2 cells were incubated at 37 °C in complete Hg-DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum and a 1:10 dilution of an antibiotic solution (0.17% w/v penicillin V, 0.1% gentamycin sulfate, and 0.01 μg/ml amphotericin). Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and were passaged with trypsin. One day before transfection with siRNA, cells were trypsinized, diluted with fresh medium without antibiotics, and transferred to 6-well plates for immunoblotting and 12-well plates for immunostaining. Transient transfection of siRNAs was conducted with Oligofectamine according to the supplier's instructions (Invitrogen). The entire mixture was added to the cells in one well resulting in a final concentration of 200 nm for the siRNAs. Cells were assayed 48 h after transfection. Triplicate assays were conducted for a minimum of three independent experiments. Mechanical Force Application—A force delivery system employing collagen-coated magnetite beads and magnetic fields was used to apply exogenous tensile forces in vitro as described previously (8Wang J. Su M. Fan J. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22889-22895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, magnetite beads (400 mg; Sigma) were incubated for 10 min with 1 ml of an acidic bovine collagen solution (>95% type I collagen; 3 mg/ml) at 37 °C and neutralized to pH 7.4 with 100 μl of 1 n NaOH. Under these conditions, collagen polymerizes and forms fibrils around the beads within 30 min. The beads were sonicated to eliminate clumps and were then dispersed. Analysis of bead size was performed by electronic particle counting (Coulter Channelyzer, Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). Prior to incubation with cells, beads were rinsed in PBS, washed three times, resuspended in Ca2+-free buffer, and added to attached cells in complete medium for 10 min. Cells were washed three times to remove unbound beads prior to exposure to force. A ceramic permanent magnet was used to apply perpendicular forces to beads attached to the dorsal surface of cells. For all experiments, the pole face was parallel with and 2 cm from the surface of the cell culture dish. As the surface area of the magnet was larger than the culture dishes, and as the bead covering was relatively uniform for all cells, the forces applied to cells across the width of the culture dish were relatively uniform (23Glogauer M. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1093-C1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constant forces (0.65 pn/μm2 projected cell area) but of varying duration were used for all experiments. Immunofluorescence—After transfection (48 h), cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, stained for SMA, and counterstained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. For double staining of SMA and actin filaments, cells were incubated with antibody to SMA, counterstained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, stained with TRITC-phalloidin, and imaged with wide field immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunoblotting—Magnetite beads with the associated focal adhesion complexes were isolated in CSKB buffer, and bead-associated proteins were recovered by magnetic selection. Beads were sonicated and washed in PBS, and the associated proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% w/v bromphenol blue). For cell lysates, the cells were washed with PBS and proteins solubilized in 200 μl of SDS sample buffer without bromphenol blue. Total protein was measured using the RC-DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), and equal quantities were loaded on SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% skim milk in TBS and incubated with the indicated antibody (SMA, vinculin, vimentin, β-actin, GAPDH, JNK, ERK1/2, and p38) diluted 1:1000 in 0.5% Tween/TBS for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Blots were washed with 0.5% Tween/TBS, incubated with appropriate second antibodies for 1 h, washed four times in Tween/TBS, and developed by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). The blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat film, and band density was analyzed by IP Lab Gel Scientific Image Processing (Signal Analytics Corp., Vienna, VA). Immunoprecipitation—The immunoprecipitation protocol for SMA has been described previously (6D'Addario M. Arora P.D. Ellen R.P. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47541-47550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped into RIPA buffer containing sodium vanadate (1 mm), a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The cell lysate was pre-cleared, normalized for protein content, and then incubated overnight with anti-SMA antibodies at 4 °C. ImmunoPure® Plus(G) from Pierce was added, and after incubation for1.5 h at 4 °C, the resin was washed four times, and specific immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and processed for immunoblotting. Northern Blotting—RNA (10 μg per sample) was denatured in formaldehyde and formamide at 55 °C for 10 min and electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gels. The SMA and β-actin cDNA probes were made by reverse transcription-PCR from Rat-2 cells using the following primers: SMA primers, 5′-ccgcaaatgcttctaagtcac-3′ (forward) and 5′-cacgagtaacaaatcaaagct-3′(reverse). For β-actin the primers were 5′-tggcctgtacactgacgtgag-3′ (forward) and 5′-tggccaggtgtcagggagata-3′ (reverse). RNA was isolated from cells (Qiagen RNeasy total RNA kit), and cDNA was produced from total RNA (2 μg per sample) using Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase. PCR products were inserted into a PCR3.9 vector using the Original TA cloning kit and sequenced to confirm the correct products (24Magnuson V.L. Young M. Schattenberg D.G. Mancini M.A. Chen D.L. Steffensen B. Klebe R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14654-14662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rho Activation—Rho activation was measured in Rat-2 cells cultured overnight without serum and subjected to force for 15 min. Control cells with beads but no force were also assayed for Rho activation. Lysophosphatidic acid treatment of these cells was performed as a positive control for Rho. Briefly, the assay relies on the specific binding of GTP-Rho to Rhotekin-RBD protein coupled to glutathione S-transferase beads. The amount of GTP-Rho was quantified by immunoblotting with a Rho monoclonal antibody and by comparing the bead-bound protein (active Rho) with total Rho in the cell lysates. G-actin and Immunodepletion—We determined G-actin content utilizing the specific binding of G actin to DNase I (25Arora P.D. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20516-20523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26Heacock C.S. Bamburg J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 22-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNase I was coupled to Aminolink (Pierce) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were lysed at -10 °C in cell lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) with 1 μm phalloidin to stabilize F-actin and sedimented at 14,000 × g for 1 min to remove cell debris, and the cell lysate was incubated with DNase beads for 2 min at 4 °C. Beads were rapidly washed three times, and bound protein (G-actin), supernatant (F-actin), and the total cell lysate (F plus G actin) were quantified by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies that recognized all actin isoforms, including β-actin and SMA. For estimation of the relative proportion of SMA in the total actin pool, we used an immunodepletion method. First, because no SMA was detected in the G-actin fraction by immunoblotting, we incubated the F-actin fraction overnight with SMA antibodies at 4 °C. SMA immunocomplexes were removed with ImmunoPure® Plus(G) (Pierce) using incubation for 1.5 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation. The remaining actins in the supernatant were processed for total actin immunoblotting as described above. Cytoskeletal Pellets—Pellets were prepared by lysing cells in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 μm phalloidin, and inhibitors. The detergent-insoluble pellet was obtained by centrifugation (20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min) and solubilized by boiling in 2% SDS sample buffer. Equivalent amounts of proteins were loaded in each lane and immunoblotted for β-actin and SMA. Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—ROS 17/2.8 cells were grown in α-DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. Prior to transfection, cells were plated at 1 × 104 cells/well in 6-well plates and incubated in complete α-DMEM for 24 h. Cells were transiently transfected with reporter plasmids containing p547/LacZ constructs (from Dr. G. Owens) in which the whole SMA promoter is present. Cells were co-transfected with a pCMV-p38 structures. The vectors used in the co-transfection are the following, and their source is indicated in parentheses: pCMV-MKK6+ (constitutively active from Dr. J. Woodgett, University of Toronto), pCMV-p38FLAG and pCMV-38WT (constitutively active; Dr. R. J. Davis, University of Massachusetts), pCMV-p38DN (dominant negative p38 from Dr. Andras Kapas). Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) expression plasmid was normalized for equal loading using the effecting reagent according to the supplier's instructions (Qiagen). Cell extracts were prepared with a detergent lysis method. For estimates of promoter activity, β-galactosidase reporter enzyme activity was measured with an enzyme assay system (Roche Applied Science). β-Galactosidase activities were normalized to RSV luciferase activity as a transfection control. The RSV (-124 to +34) luciferase construct was provided by H. P. Elsholtz (University of Toronto) and was used as described earlier (8Wang J. Su M. Fan J. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22889-22895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RSV luciferase assays were conducted using a luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RSV luciferase activity (reflecting promoter activity) was unaffected by all treatments at all experimental times. Statistical Analyses—For quantitative data, means and standard errors were computed. When appropriate, comparisons between groups were evaluated by Student's t test or analysis of variance with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. At least three independent experiments were conducted for each condition described, and in each experiment, there were at least three replicates. SMA Incorporation into Collagen Receptor Complexes—We used Rat-2 fibroblasts and ROS 17/2.8 cells as cell models to examine the role of SMA in mechanotransduction. These cells can be induced to express SMA with appropriate stimuli (27Leavitt J. Gunning P. Kedes L. Jariwalla R. Nature. 1985; 316: 840-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). They express abundant cell surface collagen receptors that provide attachment for collagen-coated beads and are readily transfected (2D'Addario M. Arora P.D. Fan J. Ganss B. Ellen R.P. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31969-31977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 5D'Addario M. Arora P.D. Ellen R.P. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47541-47550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We first examined the collagen receptors that were associated with collagen beads bound to Rat-2 cells. Immunoblotting of bead-bound proteins showed that the α2 integrin, α3 integrin, and the discoidin domain receptor 1 were associated with attached collagen beads (Fig. 1A), although in contrast, the α1 integrin was not expressed. As SMA actin filaments are associated with mature focal adhesions in human fibroblasts (19Dugina V. Fontao L. Chaponnier C. Vasiliev J. Gabbiani G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3285-3296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we asked if SMA was also enriched at collagen receptor adhesion complexes in Rat-2 cells and if this enrichment required the α2β1 integrin or α3β1 integrin. Incubation of cells with α3 integrin antibody did not block the association of SMA or the focal adhesion protein vinculin with collagen-coated magnetite beads (Fig. 1B). In contrast, incubation of cells with α2β1 integrin antibody blocked the association of SMA and vinculin with collagencoated magnetite beads. By densitometry, there was a small (18%) inhibitory effect of the α2β1 integrin on the association of β-actin with collagen beads (Fig. 1C). Fluorescence microscopy showed rings of immunohistochemically stained SMA around collagen beads that co-localized with actin filaments stained by rhodamine phalloidin (Fig. 1D). Incubation with the α2β1 integrin antibody blocked the formation of SMA-stained rings around the collagen-coated beads but did not affect staining for β-actin. Thus the incorporation of SMA into the adhesion complexes that form around collagen beads, the site of force application to cells in this model system (6D'Addario M. Arora P.D. Ellen R.P. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47541-47550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), is dependent on the α2β1 integrin. SMA Incorporation into Actin Filaments Is Sensitive to Swinholide—We determined whether swinholide A and latrunculin B, actin filament disrupting agents, could be used to block the association of SMA and β-actin with collagen receptor complexes. After washing away unattached beads, only cell-attached beads were used for analysis of bead-associated proteins. Pretreatment with latrunculin B (1 μm, 30 min) was not sufficient to dissociate SMA, β-actin, and vinculin from collagen beads. In contrast, swinholide A (0.1 μm; 20 min) strongly blocked the incorporation of SMA and vinculin into collagen bead complexes, while preserving the binding of β-actin (Fig. 2A). This result was not because of a lack of bead binding to cells because only proteins from bound beads were analyzed. Immunohistochemically stained SMA around collagen beads that co-localized with actin filaments stained by rhodamine phalloidin were found after latrunculin B treatment, whereas swinholide A blocked the formation of SMA-stained rings around the collagen-coated beads (Fig. 2B). Thus swinholide A but not latrunculin can be used reliably to dissociate SMA filaments from the sites of force application in Rat-2 cells. In some well differentiated fibroblast sub-types cultured in vitro, SMA comprises up to 14% of total actin content (14Arora P.D. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). As the rate of assembly of SMA into actin filaments during cell spreading can be quite different from that of β-actin filaments (29Hinz B. Dugina V. Ballestrem C. Wehrle-Haller B. Chaponnier C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2508-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), we considered that SMA, even as a relatively low abundance actin isoform, may have an impact on the transmission of filament-dependent mechanical signals. We estimated the relative proportions of SMA and other actin isoforms in monomeric (G-actin) form by measuring the binding of G-actin to DNase I (30Hosoya H. Mabuchi I. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 994-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) followed by actin isoform-specific immunoblotting and densitometry. In untreated Rat-2 cells, ∼20% of total actin bound to DNase I and was therefore monomeric (Fig. 2C). Treatment with swinholide A (0.1 μm; 20 min) or with latrunculin B (1 μm, 30 min) greatly increased the abundance of total actin monomers (to ∼50%) in comparison to untreated controls. In untreated samples and in samples pretreated with latrunculin B, SMA monomers were present at extremely low levels, whereas swinholide A treatment increased the amount of monomeric SMA to ∼70% (Fig. 2C). To determine the relative abundance of SMA in actin filaments, we removed G-actin wi"

Members of this family of enzymes catalyze recombination between specific DNA sequences by cleaving and exchanging one pair of strands between the two substrate sites to form a 4-way Holliday junction (HJ) intermediate and then resolve the HJ intermediate to recombinant products by a second round of strand exchanges. Recently, hexapeptide inhibitors have been described that are capable of blocking the second strand exchange step in the tyrosine recombinase recombination pathway, leading to an accumulation of the HJ intermediate. These peptides are active in the λ-integrase, Cre recombinase, and Flp recombinase systems and are potentially important tools for both in vitro mechanistic studies and as in vivo probes of cellular function. Here we present biochemical and crystallographic data that support a model where the peptide inhibitor binds in the center of the recombinase-bound DNA junction and interacts with solvent-exposed bases near the junction branch point. Peptide binding induces large conformational changes in the DNA strands of the HJ intermediate, which affect the active site geometries in the recombinase subunits.

The tyrosine recombinases (formerly referred to as the λ-integrase family) include the well-studied bacteriophage λ-integrase, Cre recombinase from bacteriophage P1, Flp recombinase from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2-micron circle, the bacterial XerC/D recombinases, and well over 100 other proteins identified among bacteria and yeast (1Nunes-Duby S.E.

An important function of site-specific recombination in bacteria is the resolution of multimeric circular replicons that are generated by homologous recombination, often as the product of DNA replication repair pathways (5Barre F.X.

A hallmark of the tyrosine recombinase mechanism of site-specific recombination is the generation of a 4-way Holliday junction (HJ) 1The abbreviations used are: HJ, Holliday junction; r.m.s.d., root mean-squared deviation; wt, wild type; 2AP, 2-aminopurine; CHESS, Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. intermediate (3Stark W.M. Boocock M.R. Sherratt D.J. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 432-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overall reaction pathway is shown schematically in Fig. 1A. Two recombination sites, each bound by two recombinase proteins, associate to form a synaptic complex at the start of the recombination process. One strand in each of the synapsed substrates is cleaved by a recombinase subunit to form a covalent 3′-phosphotyrosine linkage, liberating a free 5′-hydroxyl group. Strand swapping between the synapsed sites and subsequent intermolecular ligation between the 5′-hydroxyl group originating from one duplex substrate and the 3′-phosphotyrosine linkage of the other substrate completes the first reciprocal strand exchange and generates a 4-way DNA junction. Isomerization of the junction to an alternative, but structurally related conformer (11Gopaul D.N. Guo F. Van Duyne G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4175-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) allows cleavage and exchange of the second pair of strands between substrates using the same phosphoryl transfer chemistry and generation of recombinant duplex products. The individual steps in this process are highly reversible and a challenge in the mechanistic study of these systems has been to isolate intermediates that exist only transiently in the recombination pathway (12Burgin A.B. Nash H.A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1312-1321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Segall and co-workers (13Cassell G. Klemm M. Pinilla C. Segall A. J. Mol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 3472-3483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have recently described an approach to identify small peptides capable of trapping intermediates in λ-integrase recombination pathways. By iterative screening of mixed pools of synthetic peptides for their ability to block specific recombination steps, several potent inhibitors have been identified for both the initial synaptic complex, where the initial strand exchange is blocked, and for the HJ intermediate, where resolution of the junction in either direction is blocked. In addition to their utility as mechanistic probes to dissect the complex mechanism of λ-integrase site-specific recombination, such inhibitors could have more general utility in other biological pathways, particularly those that generate HJ intermediates (16Bolla M.L. Azevedo E.V. Smith J.M. Taylor R.E. Ranjit D.K. Segall A.M. McAlpine S.R. Org. Lett. 2003; 5: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The hexapeptide WKHYNY, for example, was originally identified based on its ability to inhibit the λ-integrase bent-L pathway, where it caused an accumulation of HJ intermediates (13Cassell G. Klemm M. Pinilla C. Segall A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1193-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This peptide specifically blocks the HJ resolution step of the reaction that would normally result in either exchange of the second pair of DNA strands to form recombinant products, or in reversal of the original strand exchange step to regenerate substrates. The same peptide does not inhibit the initial cleavage and strand exchange step of the pathway that generates the HJ intermediate, although closely related peptides (e.g. KWWCRW) have been identified that also inhibit the initial cleavage step at concentrations greater than 5 μm (14Klemm M. Cheng C. Cassell G. Shuman S. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1203-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Boldt J.L. Pinilla C. Segall A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3472-3483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the WKHYNY peptide inhibitory activity (measured as IC50 values) varies about 100-fold between the integrative, excisive, bent-L, and straight-L pathways for λ-integrase recombination (17Cassell G.D. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 413-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Presumably, subtle differences in the structure of the HJ intermediate in these pathways and corresponding differences in the interactions made with the peptide inhibitor are responsible for the range of activities observed. The WKHYNY peptide also inhibits the Cre-loxP and Flp-frt recombination pathways, resulting in an accumulation of HJ intermediates in those systems (17Cassell G.D. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 413-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Given that λ-int, Cre, and Flp have very low sequence similarity outside of a small set of conserved catalytic residues, it seems unlikely that the peptide specifically targets a feature of the recombinase protein itself. Instead, it has been suggested that the primary target is the specific recombinase-HJ DNA assembly that is formed during the reaction, where both the recombinase and the HJ DNA are recognized (14Klemm M. Cheng C. Cassell G. Shuman S. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1203-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is that the peptide specifically targets only the HJ DNA, which presents a surface of solvent-exposed bases and sugar phosphate backbone that is unique within the recombination pathway (11Gopaul D.N. Guo F. Van Duyne G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4175-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 18Chen Y. Narendra U. Iype E.L. Cox M.M. Rice A.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 885-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, related peptides have been identified that bind to bare HJ DNA with high affinity. 2K. Kepple and A. M. Segall, unpublished data. In principle, however, peptides such as WKHYNY could also bind, but not inhibit cleavage of, the initial synaptic complex formed between recombination sites at the start of the reaction. In both the synaptic complex and the HJ intermediate in the Cre-loxP system, a small number of DNA bases are exposed to solvent and could be available to interact with peptide or small molecule inhibitors (11Gopaul D.N. Guo F. Van Duyne G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4175-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 19Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20Ennifar E. Meyer J.E. Buchholz F. Stewart A.F. Suck D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5449-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To gain a deeper understanding of how peptide inhibitors block resolution of the HJ intermediate during site-specific recombination, we have applied spectroscopic and crystallographic methods to study the effects of the peptide inhibitor WKHYNY binding to the Cre-HJ intermediate. Although most studies thus far on related peptide inhibitors have focused on λ-integrase pathways (13Cassell G. Klemm M. Pinilla C. Segall A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1193-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Klemm M. Cheng C. Cassell G. Shuman S. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1203-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Bolla M.L. Azevedo E.V. Smith J.M. Taylor R.E. Ranjit D.K. Segall A.M. McAlpine S.R. Org. Lett. 2003; 5: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Cassell G.D. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 413-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the Cre system offers some experimental advantages. First, Cre is one of the simplest tyrosine recombinases, capable of recombining minimal 34-base pair loxP sites without accessory proteins or auxiliary DNA sequences (21Abremski K. Hoess R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1509-1514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second advantage is that crystal structures for each intermediate in the Cre-loxP recombination pathway are already available, which suggests that structural models of peptide inhibitors bound to the Cre-HJ complex may also be experimentally feasible. Here we present biochemical and structural data that directly address the question of where peptide inhibitors bind to the Cre-HJ intermediate and how they block junction resolution. Using a fluorescence polarization assay with labeled hexapeptide, we show that the peptide binds specifically to the Cre-HJ intermediate, but not to the synaptic complex or to free HJ DNA. To determine whether the peptide contacts DNA bases at the center of the Cre-bound HJ, a synthetic 4-way junction corresponding to the loxP reaction intermediate was constructed with branch point adenine bases replaced by the fluorescent analog 2-aminopurine (2AP). Peptide binding to this junction quenches the fluorescence of solvent-exposed 2AP bases at the center of the junction, supporting a model in which aromatic side chains from the peptide inhibitor interact with the central DNA bases. The crystal structure of peptide WKHYNY bound to the Cre-loxPHJ intermediate reveals the location of the peptide in the center of the junction where it is poorly ordered. As a result of peptide binding to the junction, both the crossing and continuous strands at the junction center undergo large conformational changes relative to structures of Cre-HJ complexes crystallized in the absence of peptide inhibitor. These changes are transmitted to the recombinase active sites, resulting in a rotation of the phosphodiester linkage that would normally be cleaved during resolution of the HJ intermediate. Surprisingly, the DNA junction conformation in the peptide-inhibited form of the Cre-HJ intermediate resembles that observed in the structure of His6-tagged Cre bound to a similar loxP-derived junction (22Martin S.S. Pulido E. Chu V.C. Lechner T.S. Baldwin E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 107-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Protein and Oligonucleotide Purification—Expression, purification, and storage of Cre wild-type, R173K mutant, and K201A mutant proteins were performed as described (23Ghosh K. Van Duyne G.D. Methods. 2002; 28: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used to construct loxP-1 and HJ1 (Fig. 1B) were synthesized using standard phosphoramidite chemistry by the W. M. Keck Facility at Yale University and were purified by reverse-phase HPLC as described (23Ghosh K. Van Duyne G.D. Methods. 2002; 28: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). DNA duplexes were formed by annealing the appropriate oligonucleotides at 1 mm concentration in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl by heating to 70 °C in a thermal cycler and cooling the mixture to 4 °C with a linear gradient of 1°/min and were used without further purification. The junction HJ1 was prepared as described previously (11Gopaul D.N. Guo F. Van Duyne G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4175-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used to construct HJ3 (Fig. 1B) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA and were purified on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. Purified single strands were annealed at 10 μm concentration in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl buffer as described above, and the HJ3 DNA obtained was then further purified under native conditions using a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris borate/EDTA (TBE). Junction DNA was electroeluted at 4 °C in 1× TBE and concentrated with a Centricon YM-10 device (Millipore). Fluorescence Polarization Measurements—5 μg of WKHYNY peptide was labeled at the N terminus with a 10-fold weight excess of fluorescein isothiocyanate in 50 μl of 20 mm NaHCO3, pH 9, 20% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) for 1 h at room temperature. The labeling reaction was directly injected onto a C18 reverse-phase HPLC column (Vydac), eluted with a 0–80% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the amino-labeled peptide peak fractions were lyophilized and resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl. Fluorescence polarization measurements were made at 18 °C using a PanVera Beacon 2000 variable temperature polarization system (PanVera Corp), equipped with 490-nm and 510-nm excitation and emission filters, respectively. Either Cre recombinase alone, HJ1 DNA alone, Cre K201A-loxP-1 complex, Cre R173K-HJ1 complex, or wild-type Cre-loxP-1 complex were titrated into a buffer containing 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 2% glycerol, 0.01 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 11 nm labeled peptide. Samples were incubated for 20 min at 18 °C prior to polarization measurement. Fluorescence anisotropies were computed from polarization measurements by the Beacon instrument. Fluorescence Quenching of Cre-HJ Complexes—Steady state fluorescence measurements were made using a Photon Technology Inc. Quantamaster model C60/2000 L-format scanning spectrofluorometer. Sample temperatures were maintained at 25 °C with a circulating water bath and were allowed to equilibrate for a minimum of 5 min before acquisition of spectra. Preliminary excitation spectra were recorded from 250 to 380 nm while monitoring emission at 390 nm. Emission spectra were recorded by scanning from 340 to 500 nm with an excitation wavelength of 320 nm. Monochromator slit widths were fixed at 2 nm for all measurements. Samples contained 100 nm HJ3 DNA and 400 nm Cre K201A mutant in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and were titrated with increasing amounts of WKHYNY peptide in the same buffer. Parallel titrations were performed for HJ3 DNA containing 2AP residues (Fig. 1) and for HJ3 DNA containing wild-type Ade bases. The small signal from the non-fluorescent complex (< 1%) was subtracted as background. Fluorescence emission intensities recorded at 390 nm were corrected for small dilution effects created by the titration and are plotted in Fig. 3. Error bars represent 2 S.D. based on sixty intensity measurements at each concentration, over two independent titrations. Crystallization and Data Measurement of the Cre-HJ-Peptide Complex—Cre-loxPHJ-WKHYNY peptide crystals were formed from solutions initially containing 13 μm wild-type Cre, 19 μm loxP-1 DNA, and 13 μm peptide in 20 mm sodium acetate pH 5.6. Cre was added to the loxP-1 duplex and peptide that had been premixed in buffer, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Calcium chloride was added to 20 mm and MPD to 25% (v/v). Hanging drops of 6-μl volume were then incubated against reservoirs containing 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 20 mm CaCl2, and 32–40% MPD at 18 °C. Plate-shaped crystals grew to 150 × 100 × 50 μm over a period of 4 weeks. These crystals diffracted to 2.8 Å at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) A1 beamline. Diffraction data were measured using a Quantum4 CCD detector at 100 K and processed using the HKL suite (24Otwinowski Z. Minor V. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Data were scaled and merged using SCALA (25Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Crystallographic Refinement—The Cre-loxPHJ-peptide crystals have similar cell constants to those of the synaptic complex, the covalent Cre-DNA intermediate, and the Cre-HJ intermediate grown from similar conditions (11Gopaul D.N. Guo F. Van Duyne G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4175-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 19Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The structure was therefore first optimized with rigid body refinement at 3-Å resolution, using the individual protein domains and the 13-bp inverted repeat DNA arms from 1CRX (26Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) as a starting model. The 8-bp spacer region encompassing positions 4′ through 4 was omitted from the starting model and from refinements until the nucleotides could be unambiguously fit into unbiased electron density maps. Iterative cycles of positional refinement with REFMAC (25Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) and model building in O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) were then performed at 3.0 and 2.8 Å. Subsequent σA-weighted 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc electron density maps showed clear density for the bases and for the backbone of the omitted central 8-base pairs that corresponded to a 4-way DNA junction. Electron density that would be diagnostic for a synaptic complex (i.e. two loxP-1 duplexes) was completely absent, confirming that the HJ intermediate had been trapped in the crystal lattice. The central 8-bp of the HJ DNA strands were modeled as (dAdU)4 until the final stages of refinement in order to avoid starting bias in the choice of sequence directionality (corresponding to which of two alternative conformers are present in the HJ intermediate). The (dAdU)4 sequence is an excellent model for either direction of the alternating purine/pyrimidine sequence found in the crossover region of the loxP site (GCATACAT versus ATGTATGC) because the purine-N2 and pyrimidine-C5 groups required to distinguish Gua from Ade and Thy from Cyt are missing. The sequence assignment of the central DNA bases was made based on the presence or absence of difference map densities for Gua-N2 and Thy-C5. Electron density maps following refinement at 2.8 Å were consistent with only one direction for the loxP spacer, corresponding to a “top strand cleavage” configuration where the top strands of the loxP sites adopt the crossing configuration. This configuration was also observed in the structure of HisCre-loxPHJ (22Martin S.S. Pulido E. Chu V.C. Lechner T.S. Baldwin E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 107-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and Cre-loxPHJ (28.Guo, F. (2000) Structural Studies on the Mechanism of Cre-loxP Site-specific Recombination. Ph.D. thesis, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PAGoogle Scholar), both of which contain the wild-type loxP crossover sequence. The basis for this isomeric preference is not yet known, but Cre has been shown to preferentially resolve synthetic HJ substrates to cleave the “top strands” (29Lee L. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31092-31098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which corresponds to the expected resolution products of the conformer that is consistently observed. Refinement of the complete model at 2.8 Å, including 296 solvent atoms and a correction for bulk solvent, converged at Rwork = 0.196 and Rfree = 0.265. Refinement results are summarized in Table I. Coordinates for the Cre-loxPHJ-peptide complex and for the unliganded Cre-loxPHJ complex (28.Guo, F. (2000) Structural Studies on the Mechanism of Cre-loxP Site-specific Recombination.

In this assay, peptide that has been labeled at its N terminus with fluorescein was held at a fixed concentration of 11 nm. The fluorescence polarization of fluorescein-labeled peptide was then monitored as Cre, DNA, or Cre-DNA complex was titrated over a range of concentrations. Two Cre-HJ complexes were tested for peptide binding. The first was formed with Cre R173K, an active site mutant that binds, but does not efficiently cleave the HJ intermediate (28.Guo, F. (2000) Structural Studies on the Mechanism of Cre-loxP Site-specific Recombination. Ph.D. thesis, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PAGoogle Scholar), and an immobile 4-way junction (HJ1) based on the loxP sequence (Fig. 1B; Ref. 11Gopaul D.N. Guo F. Van Duyne G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4175-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The second HJ complex was formed with wild-type Cre and loxP-containing DNA duplex (loxP-1), which form active recombination intermediates subject to binding and trapping by the labeled peptide during the experiment. As shown in Fig. 2 (upper curves), the labeled peptide binds with similar affinity to the preformed Cre R173K-HJ1 DNA complex and to Cre-HJ complexes formed by catalytic strand exchange. In principle, the observed interaction of peptide with wild-type Cre-loxP-1 complex could also be explained by binding to the synaptic Cre-loxP intermediate prior to strand exchange (or following resolution of the HJ intermediate to form duplex products). To specifically test for binding to a synaptic Cre-loxP complex where cleavage and strand exchange has not occurred, we used the active site mutant Cre K201A bound to loxP-1 DNA. The Cre K201A mutant is unable to cleave the DNA substrate, but forms synaptic complexes with an affinity comparable to that observed for wt-Cre. 3K. Ghosh, F. Guo, and G. Van Duyne, unpublished data. Peptide binding to this synaptic complex is weak, and is similar to that observed in a titration with Cre alone (Fig. 2, lower curves). The labeled peptide also has no significant affinity for the free, immobile HJ DNA, which is not surprising given that in the buffer used for this experiment (which contains 10 mm CaCl2), the HJ is expected to exist exclusively in the folded, stacked conformation (30Duckett D.R.

Cell. 2000; 6: 885-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that hexapeptides such as WKHYNY inhibit HJ resolution of the tyrosine recombinases by binding specifically to the HJ intermediate as it is formed and blocking the cleavage and/or strand exchange process (14Klemm M. Cheng C. Cassell G. Shuman S. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1203-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Cassell G.D. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 413-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Indeed, the interaction of peptide inhibitors with λ-Int-HJ complexes has been demonstrated using a gel shift assay and the relative affinities of a series of inhibitors has been qualitatively compared by analyzing the stability of the complexes upon dilution (17Cassell G.D. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 413-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility, however, is that a peptide inhibitor such as WKHYNY binds with comparable affinity to both the synaptic and HJ intermediate complexes, but only inhibits cleavage and/or strand exchange of the HJ intermediate.

Crenarchaeal XPF homologs lack the N-terminal helicase domain altogether and consist only of the nuclease and HhH2 domains (see Fig. 3). In this respect, they may represent the simplest and perhaps ancestral version of the XPF/Mus81 nuclease. We showed previously that the XPF homolog from Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsoXPF) 1The abbreviations used are: SsoXPF, the XPF homolog from Sulfolobus solfataricus; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; NER, nucleotide excision repair.1The abbreviations used are: SsoXPF, the XPF homolog from Sulfolobus solfataricus; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; NER, nucleotide excision repair. cuts flap or splayed duplex structures (3Roberts J.A.

Microbiol. 2003; 48: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and that its activity is crucially dependent on an association with the sliding clamp PCNA, via a C-terminal PCNA interaction motif (3Roberts J.A.

We demonstrate key similarities with both the eukaryal XPF and Mus81* nucleases. Recombinant Proteins—S. solfataricus XPF and PCNA heterotrimer were expressed and purified as described previously (3Roberts J.A. Bell S.D. White M.F. Mol.

Cleavage was initiated by adding MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm, mixed briefly, and incubated at 55 °C. 5-μl aliquots were taken at selected time points and added to chilled stop solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml calf thymus DNA) to terminate the reaction. DNA was ethanolprecipitated and analyzed on a denaturing polyacrylamide/urea/Trisborate-EDTA gel. Uncut substrate and products were quantified (Image Gauge, Fuji), and the reaction rate was obtained by linear regression. In the experiment, to determine the influence of a 5′-phospho group on activity, the PCNA-XPF concentration was reduced to 0.1 μm to allow more accurate quantitation. First, we determined the structure specificity and requirements of Sulfolobus XPF. To pin down the function of structure-specific nucleases, it is necessary to define their specificity for the different branched DNA structures that arise in vivo due to DNA damage and repair pathways. Quantitative data for eukaryal XPF-ERCC1 and Mus81* are not yet available. We have carried out a systematic quantitative analysis of the substrate preference of SsoXPF using a panel of branched DNA substrates (Table II). In each case, the sequence of the strand cleaved by XPF is the same, although its length varies in some cases. In general terms, the order of substrate preference of SsoXPF matches that of the Mus81* family rather than the eukaryal XPF family. The best substrate is a 3′ flap followed by a nicked duplex, nicked three-way junctions, and nicked fourway junctions. The efficient cleavage of a nicked duplex substrate demonstrates that no single-stranded flap is required, rather a discontinuity in the DNA duplex is enough to promote the nuclease activity. These DNA species are all the preferred substrates of Mus81* and share in common a 5′-DNA end near the branch point or point of discontinuity that has been shown to be essential in directing the activity of Mus81* (5Bastin-Shanower S.A. Fricke W.M. Mullen J.R. Brill S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3487-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The 3′ flap and nicked three-way substrates are analogs of a stalled and reversed replication fork, respectively (6Whitby M.C. Osman F. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6928-6935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, a substrate analog of an active replication fork with a 3′-DNA end near the branch point is cut much more slowly, again in common with Mus81* (6Whitby M.C. Osman F. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6928-6935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A splayed duplex species, the preferred substrate of eukaryotic XPF-ERCC1, is cleaved ∼10-fold more slowly than a 3′ flap substrate. Lastly, four-way junctions are very poor substrates for SsoXPF, cut more than 2 orders of magnitude more slowly than the preferred substrates. The clear preference of SsoXPF for a 5′-DNA end near the cleavage site mirrors that reported previously for Mus81* from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (5Bastin-Shanower S.A. Fricke W.M. Mullen J.R. Brill S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3487-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 6Whitby M.C. Osman F. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6928-6935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In vivo, most substrates of this type would have a phosphate group at this 5′ position, although this was not present in the synthetic substrates used for Mus81*. To test whether phosphorylation of this terminus was important for the activity of SsoXPF, we compared the rates of cleavage with a nicked duplex substrate with and without a 5′-phosphate at the nick (Fig. 1). We found a measurable although modest increase in the cleavage rates of a phosphorylated substrate as compared with a non-phosphorylated one, suggesting that the archaeal XPF (and probably also Mus81*) does not require the presence of a 5′-phosphate to recognize this DNA end. Recent studies of Mus81* suggest that it can play an important role in the generation of crossover recombination events by cleavage of D loop (displacement loop) substrates formed as a consequence of strand invasion after a chromosome sustains a double strand break (7Osman F. Dixon J. Doe C.L. Whitby M.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 761-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 8Hollingsworth N.M. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). A D loop bubble is a poor substrate for SsoXPF in the absence of an invading 3′-ssDNA end (Fig. 2B, left). This structure is equivalent to an NER bubble, the favored substrate of eukaryal XPF-ERCC1 (9de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7835-7842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Weak cleavage of the b75 strand is seen at the splayed duplex junction (Fig. 2B, white arrows, rate 0.02 min-1). The z75 strand is also cut weakly at the equivalent site on the other side of the bubble (rate 0.054 min-1). Once the invading strand is present, however, SsoXPF is strongly activated to cut the b75 strand at a new position (Fig. 2B, a, and C, black arrows). The invading strand creates a good substrate for SsoXPF, as observed for Mus81*, probably stimulated by the 5′-DNA end paired with the invading strand (Fig. 2A, 5′ end of oligo r26–50) (7Osman F. Dixon J. Doe C.L. Whitby M.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 761-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The rate of cleavage at this new position is at least 50-fold faster than those for the substrate without the invading strand. Cleavage at site b on the z75 strand (Fig. 2B, b, and C, gray arrows) is also stimulated by the presence of the invading duplex but is cut significantly more slowly than site a. Second end capture and DNA synthesis result in the formation of a 3′ flap substrate (site c) that is the most preferred substrate for SsoXPF (Table II). This is the second site proposed by Osman et al. (7Osman F. Dixon J. Doe C.L. Whitby M.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 761-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) for Mus81*. Cleavage at sites a and c, coupled with capture of the second strand, DNA synthesis, and strand exchange, would result in crossover recombination products (Fig. 2D). Any 3′ or 5′ flaps generated as a result of this process could be removed by XPF or Fen1. Cleavage at site a alone would dissociate a D loop and could be functionally relevant for resetting of collapsed replication forks (10Doe C.L. Osman F. Dixon J. Whitby M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5570-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Every strand scission was mapped 3′ to pyrimidine residues, confirming that although SsoXPF cuts preferentially at Mus81*-type substrates, it retains key characteristics of XPF-ERCC1. In addition to the clear similarities in their domain organization (Fig. 3), the archaeal XPF has the same sequence preference for cleavage at pyrimidines as eukaryal XPF (3Roberts J.A. Bell S.D. White M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, Mus81* has little or no sequence dependence (5Bastin-Shanower S.A. Fricke W.M. Mullen J.R. Brill S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3487-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). SsoXPF has a significant activity against splayed duplex substrates that are found at the 5′ side of lesions repaired by the eukaryal XPF protein during NER. These substrates are cut very poorly by Mus81*. Taken together, these data suggest a close relationship between the eukaryal and archaeal XPF enzymes. On the other hand, our kinetic analysis of the substrate preference of SsoXPF demonstrates clearly that the best substrates resemble stalled replication forks, D loops, and nicked Holliday junctions, with a 5′-DNA end near the branch point or strand discontinuity (Table II and Fig. 3), a feature in common with Mus81*. Cleavage of 3′ flap substrates by Mus81-Mms4 is strongly stimulated by the presence of a 5′ terminus within 4 nucleotides of the branch point (5Bastin-Shanower S.A. Fricke W.M. Mullen J.R. Brill S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3487-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The highly efficient cleavage of a nicked duplex substrate demonstrates that the archaeal XPF protein seeks out strand discontinuities that allow DNA deformation, flanked on either side by duplex DNA, rather than branched DNA substrates per se. This is also the case for Mus81*, which cleaves nicked duplexes efficiently to generate 5-nucleotide gapped duplexes (5Bastin-Shanower S.A. Fricke W.M. Mullen J.R. Brill S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3487-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These substrates are cut very poorly by eukaryal XPF-ERCC1. D loop substrates are also cut by SsoXPF and Mus81* in a similar way, with strong stimulation observed when strand invasion occurs. Therefore, the archaeal XPF clearly has the potential to act as both a Mus81-like flap endonuclease and an XPF-like repair endonuclease. Previous comparisons of the activity of Mus81-Mms4 with Rad1-Rad10 have come to the conclusion that the specificities of the two enzymes do not overlap. The presence of a 5′-DNA terminus within 4 nucleotides of the branch point results in strong stimulation of Mus81-Mms4 and reduces the activity of Rad1-Rad10 such that the two enzymes have at least a 100-fold preference for their specific substrates (5Bastin-Shanower S.A. Fricke W.M. Mullen J.R. Brill S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3487-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). SsoXPF bridges these two diverged proteins and likely represents the ancestral form of both enzymes. Hyperthermophiles such as S. solfataricus suffer a higher frequency of DNA damage such as hydrolytic deamination, oxidation, and single strand breaks as a consequence of their higher growth temperatures (11Grogan D.W. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 180-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Many of these lesions are known to stall or collapse replication forks; for example, a single strand break is converted to a double strand break if replicated. Stalled and collapsed forks are a frequent event in bacteria and eukarya, which consequently have efficient mechanisms to recover from these potentially catastrophic events. One mechanism for fork rescue is via the formation of a Holliday junction, which can be resolved to allow replication restart (reviewed in Ref. 12McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity we have described for SsoXPF is consistent with a role in the cleavage of stalled replication forks to generate substrates for recombination and/or resolution of early recombination intermediates (D loops), similar to Mus81*. In this regard, the requirement of SsoXPF for PCNA as an essential cofactor may be relevant as the target sites of the enzyme may be determined in part by PCNA loading. This is well illustrated by consideration of the D loop substrate (Fig. 2D). The recombination scheme requires extension by DNA replication of both the invading 3′ strand (strand x50) and of the second DNA end after capture. This replication will result in loading of PCNA on both these duplexes. This may direct SsoXPF to cut at sites a and c, thus generating recombinogenic DNA ends. In contrast, cleavage at site b could be disfavored in vivo as PCNA will not be loaded on this duplex. The data presented here do not rule out the possibility that SsoXPF also functions in an archaeal NER pathway. The function of eukaryal XPF-ERCC1 is largely determined by the protein:protein interactions it makes. In NER, this includes specific interactions between ERCC1 and XPA (13Li L. Lu X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5396-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and between XPF and the C terminus of the helicase XPB, a component of the multiprotein complex TFIIH (14Evans E. Moggs J.G. Hwang J.R. Egly J.M. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6559-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Thus XPF-ERCC1 is recruited into the assembling repair complex and positioned to introduce a single strand cleavage 5′ of a DNA lesion. XPF-ERCC1 also has roles in the resolution of DNA interstrand cross-links (15Kuraoka I. Kobertz W.R. Ariza R.R. Biggerstaff M. Essigmann J.M. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26632-26636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 16Niedernhofer L.J. Odijk H. Budzowska M. van Drunen E. Maas A. Theil A.F. de Wit J. Jaspers N.G.

Beverloo B. de Wit J. Muijtjens M. Odijk H. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6540-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These functions link XPF-ERCC1 to recombinational pathways and necessitate recruitment of the enzyme into different DNA processing complexes from those formed during NER. Similarly, interactions of SsoXPF mediated by PCNA may help to define its role in vivo."

Besides the structural homology, maurocalcine also modulates RyR1 channel activity in a manner akin to a synthetic peptide of domain A. Because of these similarities, we hypothesized that maurocalcine and domain A may bind onto an identical region(s) of RyR1. Using a set of RyR1 fragments, we demonstrate that peptide A and maurocalcine bind onto two discrete RyR1 regions: fragments 3 and 7 encompassing residues 1021–1631 and 3201–3661, respectively. The binding onto fragment 7 is of greater importance and was thus further investigated. We found that the amino acid region 3351–3507 of RyR1 (fragment 7.2) is sufficient for these interactions. Proof that peptide A and maurocalcine bind onto the same site is provided by competition experiments in which binding of fragment 7.2 to peptide A is inhibited by preincubation with maurocalcine. Moreover, when expressed in COS-7 cells, RyR1 carrying a deletion of fragment 7 shows a loss of interaction with both peptide A and maurocalcine.

The bi-directional communication between RyR1 and DHPR (i.e. orthograde and retrograde signals) has been shown to be enabled by the physical interactions of the two Ca2+ channels (1Schneider M.F.

Indeed, the cytoplasmic loop linking domains II and III of the α1 subunit has been proposed to be responsible for the mechanical coupling between the DHPR and the RyR1 (6Tanabe T. Beam K.G.

Within this loop, two regions (domains A and C) have been shown to regulate ryanodine binding and channel gating of RyR1 in vitro (8El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). RyR1 activity is regulated in vitro by a number of chemical compounds such as ATP, Ca2+, Mg2+, and proteins such as calmodulin and FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) (9Melzer W. Herrmann-Frank A.

Nevertheless, due to (i) the extremely large size of RyR1, (ii) the small number of high affinity effectors, and (iii) the absence of atomic resolution structure, the mapping of the functional sites of RyR1 is still far from completion. As part of the search for molecules able to strongly modify RyR1 properties, toxins isolated from scorpion venoms have been described as the most active effectors of RyR1. Among them, imperatoxin A and maurocalcine (MCa) have been extensively characterized both in terms of their effects on RyR1 and their three-dimensional structure (11Gurrola G.B. Arévalo C.

The observed homologies in amino acid sequences and in three-dimensional solution structure have prompted different authors to make the hypothesis that imperatoxin A and MCa could share a common binding site with the domain A of the DHPR α1 subunit on the RyR1. We have therefore undertaken the identification of the amino acid region of RyR1 that carries the binding site for MCa and/or the domain A of the skeletal DHPR α1 subunit. In this work, a set of polypeptides covering the entire sequence of RyR1 was expressed in vitro and tested individually for their ability to interact with either MCa or peptide Ask (a synthetic peptide corresponding to the domain A of the skeletal DHPR α1 subunit). We identified a single domain of RyR1 interacting with both MCa and peptide Ask. We also showed that MCa and peptide Ask compete for the interaction on this domain. To asses the functional relevance of this domain for the effect of MCa on RyR1, we expressed a RyR1 channel that lacks the MCa binding domain in COS-7 cells and measured the effect of this deletion on the interaction of RyR1 with both MCa and peptide Ask as well as on the activation of ryanodine binding by MCa. Taken together, our results show that MCa and domain A of the DHPR α1 subunit share a common binding site on RyR1. Purification of RyR1—Skeletal heavy SR vesicles and purified RyR1 were prepared as described previously (17Marty I. Robert M. Villaz M. De Jongh K.S. Lai Y. Catterall W.A. Ronjat M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Pull-down Experiments—Polystyrene magnetic beads (500 μg) coated with streptavidine (Dynal) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of biotinylated peptide (100 μg/ml in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm CaCl2, pCa5, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4)). Beads were then washed three times with buffer A and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with purified RyR1 (100 nm in buffer A). After washing twice with buffer A, bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies directed against RyR1 (20Marty I Villaz M Arlaud G. Bally I. Ronjat M. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cloning and Expression of RyR1 Fragments—RyR1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number X15750) was subcloned in pSG5 vector (Stratagene) by a PCR-based method (21Cheng W. Carbonneau L. Keys L. Altafaj X. Ronjat M. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 220aGoogle Scholar), leading to the following fragments: fragment F1 (aa 1–526), F2 (aa 527–1021), F3 (aa 1022–1631), F4 (aa 1632–2169), F5 (aa 2170–2697), F6 (aa 2698–3200), F7 (aa 3201–3661), F8 (aa 3662–4244). Fragment F9 (aa 4007–5037) was produced by cutting the original pCIneo-RyR1 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Allen) with XhoI, followed by self-ligation. 35S-Labeled RyR1 fragments were expressed using a coupled in vitro transcription and translation system (TNT™ kit, Promega). For pull-down assays, 5 μlof the translation product were incubated with polystyrene magnetic beads coated with the peptide of interest as described above. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, beads were washed with 1 volume of buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted in denaturing buffer and analyzed by autoradiography after separation on SDS-PAGE. Expression and Purification of Fusion Proteins—RyR1-F7 was subcloned into F7.1, F7.2, and F7.3 and the constructs inserted in His-tag pMR78 vector (22Arnaud N. Cheynet V. Oriol G. Mandrand B. Mallet F. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 199: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli BL21 pLys(DE3) bacteria were transformed with each construct and protein synthesis induced for 3 h by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in MCAC buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors, Triton X-100 (0.1% v/v), DNase I (50 μg), and MgCl2 (10 mm). After sonication, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (15 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C). Fusion proteins were immobilized onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) and washed with 4 volumes of MCAC buffer containing 60 mm imidazole. Retained proteins were eluted with MCAC buffer containing 250 mm imidazole and detected by Western blot with anti-His antibodies (dilution 1:10,000, Sigma). Transfection of COS-7 Cells with RyR1 Constructs and Cytoimmunofluorescence—Wild-type RyR1 (RyR1wt) construct was cloned into pCI-neo vector (Promega). RyR1ΔF7 construct was generated from the pCI-neo/RyR1 clone by cutting out the sequence between nucleotides 9730 and 10983. COS-7 cells were transfected with RyR1wt or RyR1ΔF7 constructs using the jetPEI™ reagent (Qbiogene). Immunofluorescence analysis was performed 48 h after transfection. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed three times with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% goat serum before adding anti-RyR1 antibodies (dilution 1:200 in PBS-0.1% Tween 20, PBS-T) (20Marty I Villaz M Arlaud G. Bally I. Ronjat M. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After 2 h, cells were washed four times with PBS-T and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with Alexa488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1:800 in PBS-T). Cells were washed four times with PBS-T, mounted, and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS-SP2 operating system. Microsomes Preparation—COS-7 cells were harvested 48 h after transfection in cold buffer containing 320 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors. Cells were homogenized and centrifuged for 5 min at 7000 × g at 4 °C. Microsomes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, resuspended in the same buffer and stored in liquid nitrogen. [3H]Ryanodine Binding Assay—Microsomes (100 μg of protein) were incubated 1 h at room temperature with 1 μm recombinant FKBP12 in 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA and CaCl2 (pCa5), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, buffer. After 150-min incubation at 37 °C in the presence of [3H]ryanodine (10 nm) and caffeine (0 or 6 mm), ATP (0 or 6 mm) or MCa (0 or 30 nm), free and bound [3H]ryanodine were separated by filtration of the microsomes on Whatmann GF/B filters and [3H]ryanodine measured by liquid scintillation. Nonspecific [3H]ryanodine binding was measured in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled ryanodine. Fig. 1A shows the primary structure of MCa, domain A and domain C of the II-III loop of the skeletal muscle α1 DHPR. Biotinylated peptides, named MCab, peptide Ask (pAsk), and peptide Csk (pCsk), corresponding to these different sequences were synthesized and immobilized on polystyrene beads coated with streptavidine. Fig. 1B shows the SDS-PAGE analysis of the bound RyR1 on beads covered with each of the peptide. A polypeptide band corresponding to RyR1 is only observed in the bound fraction obtained with beads covered with MCab or peptide Ask. No signal was detected when beads were covered with peptide Csk or biotin. These results confirm the specificity of the interaction between the skeletal sequence of domain A and RyR1 and represent the first biochemical evidence of a direct interaction of MCa with RyR1. To identify the amino acid sequences of RyR1 involved in the interaction with MCab and peptide Ask, we generated a contig of nine clones encompassing the full-length RyR1 cDNA (Fig. 1C). Each clone was expressed separately in an in vitro cell-free translation system in the presence of radiolabeled [35S]methionine. RyR1 fragments (F1–F9) were incubated in the presence of beads covered either with MCab, peptide Ask, peptide Csk, or biotin. The fragments interacting with the different peptides were detected by autoradiography after separation on SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1C shows that among the nine translated fragments, the F7 fragment encompassing RyR1 residues 3201–3661 interacts strongly with MCab and with peptide Ask. Fragment F3 encompassing RyR1 residues 1021–1631 consistently shows a weak interaction with both MCab and peptide Ask. In agreement with what is observed with purified RyR1, no significant interaction with peptide Csk was observed with any of the nine RyR1 fragments. Similarly, no interaction was observed of any fragment with beads covered with biotin (data not shown). Statistical analysis of the amount of complex formed with each of the fragment shows that about 50% of the F7 fragment interacts with MCab or peptide Ask, while only about 15% of the F3 fragment was retained by MCab or peptide Ask. For all other fragments, the amount of complex formed with MCab or peptide Ask was not significantly different from what observed with peptide Csk and represented less than 5% of the input. To further define the RyR1 sequence that interacts with MCab and peptide Ask, the cDNA corresponding to F7 was subcloned into three smaller fragments, named F7.1, F7.2, and F7.3, encompassing RyR1 residues 3201–3350, 3351–3507, and 3508–3661, respectively (Fig. 2A). Corresponding polypeptides were then expressed in E. coli, affinity-purified trough their histidine tag, and tested for their interaction with MCab or peptide Ask. Interacting fragments were detected by immunolabeling with antibodies directed against the His-tag, after separation on SDS-PAGE. Fig. 2A shows that only the fragment F7.2, encompassing residues 3351–3507, retains the ability to interact with both MCab and peptide Ask. No interaction was observed with fragment F7.1 or F7.3. The specificity of the interaction of the F7.2 fragment with MCab and peptide Ask was confirmed by the lack of signal with beads covered with peptide Csk or biotin (data not shown). We therefore investigated the ability of MCab to inhibit the interaction of fragment F7.2 with peptide Ask. Incubation of fragment F7.2 for 2 h in the presence of non-biotinylated MCa induces a complete loss of interaction of this fragment with immobilized peptide Ask (Fig. 2B) strongly suggesting that MCa and peptide Ask interact on the same site on the F7.2 fragment. We next investigated the importance of the F7 region in the sensitivity of RyR1 to MCa. For this purpose, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with two plasmids encoding the DsRed protein and the entire RyR1 (RyR1wt) or the RyR1 deleted of residues 3241–3661 (RyR1ΔF7) (Fig. 3). Immunolabeling of DsRed-positive cells with antibodies directed against the C-terminal domain of RyR1 demonstrates that RyR1wt and RyR1ΔF7 exhibit a similar distribution within the cell. This distribution essentially consists in a cytoplasmic labeling most likely representing the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3A). Fluorescence analysis showed that about 10% of cells co-express DsRed and RyRwt or DsRed and RyRΔF7. A weak labeling with anti-RyR1 antibodies was also observed in cells that do not express DsRed protein, suggesting that some cells could express exogenous RyR1 without DsRed or that they possess a low level of endogenous RyR1 expression (however barely detected by Western blot analysis, Fig. 3B). To establish the functional relevance of the F7 region in RyR1 regulation by MCa or peptide Ask, we first studied the ability of expressed RyR1wt and RyR1ΔF7 to interact with MCa or peptide Ask. For this purpose, we prepared microsomes from cells transfected with either RyR1wt or RyR1ΔF7. Immunoblot analysis of the different microsome preparations using antibodies directed against RyR1 (Fig. 3B, top left panel) supports the localization of expressed RyR1wt and RyR1ΔF7 in reticulum membrane of transfected cells. These results also show that RyR1wt and RyR1ΔF7 are expressed at a similar level and remain stable in transfected cells. Finally, endogenous RyR1, if present, is barely measurable. Using these microsome preparations, we performed pull-down experiments with beads covered with either MCa or peptide Ask. Fig. 3B (top right panel) shows that in contrast to RyR1wt, RyR1ΔF7 almost completely loss its ability to interact with both MCa and peptide Ask. We then characterized the [3H]ryanodine binding on RyR1wt or RyR1ΔF7 and tested the effects of caffeine, ATP, and MCa on this binding. No significant specific [3H]ryanodine binding was observed on microsomes obtained from non-transfected cells (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). In addition, no effect of caffeine, ATP, or MCa was observed on these control microsomes. These data confirmed immunological and Western blot data showing a low level if any of endogenous RyR1 in COS-7 cells. In contrast, [3H]ryanodine binding was observed on microsomes populations obtained from COS-7 cells transfected with RyR1 constructs. Specific binding was 116 ± 57 fmol/mg and 113 ± 31 fmol/mg for microsomes obtained from RyR1wt and RyR1ΔF7 transfected cells, respectively. Taken together with the Western blot analysis, these results indicate a similar [3H]ryanodine binding ability of expressed RyR1wt and RyR1ΔF7. Activation of [3H]ryanodine binding by caffeine, ATP, and MCa is presented in Fig. 3B (bottom panel). In the presence of 6 mm caffeine or ATP, similar increase of the [3H]ryanodine binding was observed on RyR1wt and RyR1ΔF7 microsomes. In contrast, 30 nm MCa induced a 202 ± 28% increase of [3H]ryanodine binding on RyR1wt microsomes but no significant change of [3H]ryanodine binding on RyR1ΔF7 microsomes (107 ± 3%). These results demonstrate that deletion of RyR1 residues 3241–3661, included in fragment F7, induces a complete loss of RyR1 sensitivity to MCa without significantly modify its sensitivity to caffeine or ATP. In this work, we identified two sequences of RyR1, fragment F3 encompassing residues 1021–1631 and fragment F7 comprising the residues 3201–3661, that are able to interact in vitro with both MCa and domain A of the II-III loop of the DHPR α1 subunit. Among these two sequences, fragment F7 displays the strongest interaction with MCa and peptide Ask. We then generated a RyR1 construct that lacks the amino acid region corresponding to fragment F7. This RyR1ΔF7 construct displays an expression profile and a sensitivity to caffeine or ATP similar to the wild-type RyR1. In contrast, deletion of the F7 region abolished the interaction of RyR1 with both MCa and peptide Ask as well as the stimulatory effect of MCa on ryanodine binding, highlighting the critical role of this domain for MCa regulation. A molecular dissection of fragment F7 allowed us to identify a discrete domain corresponding to residues 3351–3507 (fragment F7.2) responsible for the interaction of MCa and peptide Ask with RyR1. These results demonstrate that MCa and domain A interact with the same RyR1 region within the 3351–3507 stretch of residues. Binding of MCa and peptide Ask to the same RyR1 site was confirmed by the complete inhibition of the interaction of peptide Ask with the fragment F7.2 in the presence of an excess of MCa. Using an affinity chromatography approach, Leong and MacLennan (23Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29958-29964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) identified a domain of RyR1 that interacts with the entire II-III loop of the DHPR α1 subunit. This sequence (residues 1076–1112) is included within fragment F3 that we found to interact more weakly with both peptide Ask and MCa. In contrast, these authors did not observe any significant interaction of the entire II-III loop with a polypeptide comprising residues 3158–3724 (including F7). The results presented here, together with our previous results, suggest that domain Ask is the only sequence of II-III loop interacting with RyR1 (19O'Reilly F. Robert M. Jona I. Szegedi C. Albrieux M. Geib S. De Waard M. Villaz M. Ronjat M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The difference between the two sets of results may reflect an effect of the distal part of the II-III loop on its conformation thereby possibly modifying the accessibility of domain Ask to RyR1. Several studies using either RyR1/RyR2 or RyR1/RyR3 chimeras led to the identification of different domains of RyR1 involved in functional and structural interaction of DHPR with RyR1 (24Protasi F. Paolini C. Nakai J. Beam K.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3230-3244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Perez C.F. Mukherjee S. Allen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39644-39652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, fragment F7 carrying the MCa and peptide Ask binding domain is included in one of these domains formally defined as domain R9 or Ch-9. Similarly, the deletion of residues 1272–1455 of RyR1 (included in F3 fragment) has been shown to induce a loss of depolarization-induced calcium release (25Perez C.F. Mukherjee S. Allen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39644-39652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, regardless of the approach, the two regions of RyR1 spanning fragments F3 and F7 have been shown to play important roles in the functional communication between RyR1 and DHPR. In agreement with previous studies suggesting that noncontiguous regions of RyR1 may act together to control the functional coupling between RyR1 and DHPR, the F3 and F7 fragments may form a unique functional domain. This possibility is supported by three-dimensional reconstruction of RyR1 indicating that regions including the F3 and F7 fragments could be close from each other in the RyR1 tetramer (26Wagenknecht T. Samso M. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 464-474Crossref Google Scholar). In conclusion, we identified the binding domains of MCa and domain A on RyR1. We also introduce the first biochemical evidence that MCa and domain A of the DHPR α1 subunit interact with identical sequences on RyR1. In view of the important effects of MCa on RyR1 gating properties (13Chen L. Estève E. Sabatier J.M. Ronjat M. De Waard M. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 37822-37831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the RyR1 sequences that we identified in this report ought to play an important function in RyR1 calcium channel behavior. The fact that domain A of the II-III loop of DHPR binds onto the same RyR1 sequences re-opens the question of the role of the domain A in the control of RyR1 calcium channel activity in the context of the DHPR/RyR1 complex. Our results suggest that the two sequences of RyR1 (F3 and F7), which are involved in the binding of MCa, could fold together to create a unique MCa binding site. Cryoelectron microscopy studies of the RyR1-MCa complex should permit to test this hypothesis and to refine the correspondence between primary structure and three-dimensinoal reconstruction images of RyR1."
https://openalex.org/W2005217453,"Here we report on a Chlamydia trachomatis gene that complements the growth defect of a thymidylate synthase-deficient strain of Escherichia coli. The complementing gene encodes a 60.9-kDa protein that shows low level primary sequence homology to a new class of thymidylate-synthesizing enzymes, termed flavin-dependent thymidylate synthases (FDTS). Purified recombinant chlamydial FDTS (CTThyX) contains bound flavin. Results with site-directed mutants indicate that highly conserved arginine residues are required for flavin binding. Kinetic characterization indicates that CTThyX is active as a tetramer with NADPH, methylenetetrahydrofolate, and dUMP required as substrates, serving as source of reducing equivalents, methyl donor, and methyl acceptor, respectively. dTMP and H4folate are products of the reaction. Production of H4folate rather than H2folate, as in the classical thymidylate synthase reaction, eliminates the need for dihydrofolate reductase, explaining the trimethoprim-resistant phenotype displayed by thyA–E. coli-expressing CTThyX. In contrast to the extensively characterized thyA-encoded thymidylate synthases, which form a ternary complex with substrates dUMP and CH2H4folate and follow an ordered sequential mechanism, CTThyX follows a ping-pong kinetic mechanism involving a methyl enzyme intermediate. Mass spectrometry was used to localize the methyl group to a highly conserved arginine, and site-directed mutagenesis showed this arginine to be critical for thymidylate synthesizing activity. These differentiating characteristics clearly distinguish FDTS from ThyA, making this class of enzymes attractive targets for rational drug design.

Chlamydiae are extremely successful intracellular pathogens, in part due to their unique biphasic developmental cycle consisting of two morphologically and biochemically distinct forms. The elementary body is the metabolically inactive extracellular form capable of initiating infection. The reticulate body is the metabolically active intracellular form, which divides by binary fission within the confines of a membrane-bound vacuole, termed an inclusion (1Moulder J.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 143-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chlamydiae are capable of transporting NTPs but not dNTPs directly from the host cell (8McClarty G. Tipples G. J.

Chlamydiae contain nrdA and nrdB, encoding the two subunits of ribonucleotide reductase required for the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. Ribonucleotide reductase accounts for the acquisition of three (dCTP, dGTP, and dATP) of the four deoxyribonucleotides needed for DNA biosynthesis. The fourth nucleotide, dTTP, is produced by two well known processes. Exogenous thymidine can be directly salvaged by thymidine kinase or dTMP can be synthesized de novo from dUMP, a reaction catalyzed by thymidylate synthase (ThyA) (11Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu.

Until recently, ThyA was thought to represent the only enzyme capable of catalyzing the de novo formation of dTMP in vivo. ThyA carries out the reductive methylation of dUMP, using methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2H4folate) as a one-carbon donor and source of reducing equivalents, generating dTMP and dihydrofolate (H2folate) as products. Because reduced folates are essential for many biochemical processes, H2folate is rapidly reduced to H4folate by DHFR with subsequent regeneration of CH2H4folate being catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (11Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 19Myllykallio H. Lipowski G. Leduc D. Filee J. Forterre P. Liebl U. Science. 2002; 297: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Together these reactions are known as the thymidylate cycle. Recently the existence of a novel family of thymidylate-synthesizing enzymes, called thymidylate synthase complementing proteins or flavin-dependent thymidylate synthases (FDTS), encoded by thyX, has been described (19Myllykallio H.

The first discovered member of this family was a gene encoding a protein shown to complement a thymidine-requiring mutant of Dictyostelium discoideum (25Dynes J.L. Firtel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7966-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In silico analyses indicate that homologues of FDTS are present in upwards of 30% of sequenced microbial genomes (19Myllykallio H. Lipowski G. Leduc D. Filee J. Forterre P. Liebl U.

Most interestingly, many of the genomes containing ThyX lack DHFR (19Myllykallio H. Lipowski G. Leduc D. Filee J. Forterre P. Liebl U.

This information coupled with the observation that NADH or NADPH are required for Helicobacter pylori FDTS dTMP synthesis activity has led to the suggestion that CH2H4folate acts solely as a one-carbon donor producing H4folate as the product, allowing for the conservation of reduced folates (19Myllykallio H.

It has been demonstrated recently that the reduced pyridine nucleotide required in the FDTS reaction is involved in reducing the enzyme-associated FAD molecule prior to substrate interaction with the enzyme (24Agrawal N. Lesley S.A. Kuhn P. Kohen A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10295-10301Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This involvement of an alternative reducing agent in FDTS reactions could account for the lack of a DHFR homologue in many organisms encoding thyX. Several years ago we isolated a clone from a C. trachomatis genomic DNA library that complemented an E. coli thyA mutant to thymidine prototrophy (29Fan H. Thymidylate Biosynthesis in Chlamydia trachomatis. University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada1994: 1-207Google Scholar). The complementing open reading frame showed no homology to proteins deposited in the public data bases at that time. Results from the C. trachomatis serovar D genome sequencing project (14Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C. Fan J. Marathe R. Aravind L. Mitchell W. Olinger L. Tatusov R.L. Zhao Q. Koonin E.V.

Cross-species in silico analyses have shown that, although CT632 (60.9 kDa) is twice as large as typical FDTS (≈26–30 kDa) proteins and shows very low primary sequence homology to them, it does contain a partial sequence motif characteristic of FDTS proteins (19Myllykallio H. Lipowski G. Leduc D. Filee J. Forterre P. Liebl U. Science. 2002; 297: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 20Leduc D. Graziani S. Lipowski G. Marchand C. Le Marechal P. Liebl U. Myllykallio H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here we report the kinetic characteristics of chlamydial FDTS. Chemicals, Bacterial Strains, and Plasmids—[6-3H]dUMP (22 Ci/mmol) and [5-3H]dUMP(15 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA. H2folate, H4folate, dTMP, dUMP, NADPH, NADH, FMN, FAD, and thymidine were purchased from Sigma. CH2H4folate was donated by Merck. For H4folate and CH2H4folate, the biologically relevant R-stereoisomers were used in all assays. All other chemicals were of reagent grade or better. Escherichia coli DH5α [supE44ΔlacU169 (Φ80lacZΔM15) hsdR17recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1] is routinely maintained in our laboratory, and E. coli MH2707 (LAM–e14–thi-1 relA1 thyA114(Stable)::Mu) was obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center (New Haven, CT). The pQE80L plasmid was purchased from Qiagen. Cloning of C. trachomatis ThyX and E. coli ThyA—C. trachomatis thyX was PCR-amplified from purified chromosomal DNA as described previously (30Fehlner-Gardiner C. Roshick C. Carlson J.H. Hughes S. Belland R.J. Caldwell H.D. McClarty G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26893-26903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The PCR primer sequences for CTThyX are forward, 5′-CCCCGGTACCATGTTGAGCAAAGAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCCCAAGCTTTTAAGACTTTTTACG-3′, and were designed to include unique KpnI and HindIII restriction sites (underlined) for cloning. The PCR products were gel-purified, restricted, and then ligated into the expression vector pQE80-L, which had been cut with the same restriction enzymes. Constructs were transformed into DH5α for screening, purified by miniprep, and then used to transform MH2720E. coli for complementation and expression of recombinant His-tagged CTThyX. Expression and Purification of Recombinant C. trachomatis FDTS— E. coli strains DH5α and MH2720 transformed with wild type or various mutant CTThyX plasmid constructs were grown in 1 liter of LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an A of 0.6 at 595 nm. The plasmids were induced by the addition of IPTG to a concentration of 1 mm and were further incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) and frozen at –80 °C. After thawing on ice, the cells were lysed by sonication in the presence of lysozyme (at a final concentration of 350 μg/ml). Cell lysates were clarified by ultracentrifugation at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti60 rotor for 2 h at 4 °C. All remaining steps were carried out at 4 °C. Recombinant His-tagged protein was purified from the supernatant by metal chelation chromatography. Briefly, clarified lysates were passed through a 3-ml activated nickel metal chelation column followed by washing with 15 ml of binding buffer and 15 ml of wash buffer (60 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 ml Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). The bound recombinant protein was then eluted off the column with elution buffer (200 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). Glycerol was added to the purified protein at a final concentration of 10% to prevent precipitation. Purified CTThyX was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in the dark against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 5% glycerol. Samples were then aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Measurement of Protein Concentration—Protein concentrations were estimated by using the Bio-Rad protein assay based on the dye-binding procedure of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Spectroscopic Analysis—The absorption spectrum of FAD bound to wild type and mutant CTThyX was determined. FAD was extracted from purified CTThyX by incubating at 95 °C for 10 min in the dark. Precipitated protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge 5417C) for 10 min. The absorption spectra of the released flavin present in the supernatant was determined spectrophotometrically (Beckman Du62 Spectrophotometer) from 250 to 750 nm in a 1-cm quartz cuvette (19Myllykallio H. Lipowski G. Leduc D. Filee J. Forterre P. Liebl U. Science. 2002; 297: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The pQE80L plasmid containing wild type C. trachomatis thyX was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers containing the desired mutations were designed based on the consensus nucleotide sequence of the C. trachomatis serovar D CT632 gene (thyX) (GenBank™ accession number AE001334) and are shown in Table I. All plasmid constructs were confirmed for appropriate mutations by DNA sequencing.Table IPrimers used for site-directed mutagenesis of C. trachomatis FDTSMutated amino acidPrimers used for site-directed mutagenesisName of primerSequenceaCodons that are mutated are indicated by boldface type.R124A5′CTThyXR124A5′-GAAGATGCTGCGATTGGAGGGTCCCCCC-3′3′CTThyXR124A5′-GGGGGGACCCTCCAATCGCAGCATCTTC-3′S133A5′CTThyXS133A5′-CCCCCCTAGAAAAAGCGTCTAGATACG-3′3′CTThyXS133A5′-CGTATCTAGACGCTTTTTCTAGGGGGG-3′R397A5′CTThyXR397A5′-CGGGATTTACAAAGACATGCTATCCTAACTC-3′3′CTThyXR397A5′-GAGTTAGGATAGCATGTCTTTGTAAATCCCG-3′R477A5′CTThyXR477A5′-GGCTTTGTGAGTTAGCCTCTCAACCACAAGGGC-3′3′CTThyXR477A5′-GCCCTTGTGGTTGAGAGGCTAACTCACAAAGCC-3′a Codons that are mutated are indicated by boldface type. Open table in a new tab Complementation—MH2720 cells transformed with pQE80L-CTThyX, pQE80L-CTThyXR124A, pQE80L-CTThyXS133A, pQE80L-CTThyXR397A, pQE80L-CTThyXR477A, or pQE80L (no insert, vector control) were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 40 μg/ml thymidine. One ml of the overnight culture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min (Eppendorf centrifuge 5417C), and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was then washed three times in ice-cold sterile phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were streaked onto minimal medium plates containing IPTG (200 μl of 100 mm IPTG added to the surface and allowed to dry) and either no thymidine or 40 μg/ml thymidine. The plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight and then photographed. High Performance Liquid Chromatography—Nucleotides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a 12.5-cm C18 reverse phase column under isocratic conditions with a flow rate of 1 ml/min, the mobile phase consisted of 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 5 mm tetrabutylammonium dihydrogen phosphate, and 5% (v/v) acetonitrile (32Carreras C.W. Climie S.C. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6038-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Radioactive peaks were detected by monitoring in-line radioactive flow (171 detector; Beckman Instruments). The identities of the radioactive peaks were confirmed by simultaneously monitoring the A260 (1066 UV detector; Beckman Instruments) of dTMP and dUMP standards. Folates were separated using a 25-cm C18 column under isocratic conditions with a mobile phase consisting of 10 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm tetrabutylammonium phosphate, 5% acetonitrile, 20% methanol and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The buffer was extensively degassed and then maintained in a nitrogen gas environment in order to enhance the stability of the reduced folates. Peaks were detected by monitoring the A295. The identities of the individual peaks were determined by comparison with known H2folate, H4folate, and CH2H4folate standards. Thymidylate Synthesis Assay—Thymidylate synthesizing activity was determined by monitoring the amount of tritium transferred to water using [5-3H]dUMP as substrate similar to that described for assaying thymidylate synthase activity and H. pylori FDTS activity (20Leduc D. Graziani S. Lipowski G. Marchand C. Le Marechal P. Liebl U. Myllykallio H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 33Bisson L.F. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12456-12462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All reactions were performed at 37 °C in a nitrogen gas environment to limit reduced folate decomposition. The optimized standard reaction mixture contained, in a total volume of 100 μl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 200 μm 5,10-CH2H4folate, 2 mm NADPH, 200 μm [5-3H]dUMP (15 μCi/ml), 5% glycerol. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2.5 μg of purified CTThyX. After 3 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 300 μl of a 100 mg/ml activated charcoal suspension containing 2% trichloroacetic acid to remove the unused radiolabeled substrate [5-3H]dUMP. The samples were mixed at room temperature for 1 h and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge 5417C) for 5 min to pellet the charcoal. Radioactivity in the supernatant was quantitated in a Beckman LS 5000 liquid scintillation counter after the addition of 5 ml of scintillation fluid (Universol, ICN Biomedical). One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to the production of 1 mmol of dTMP synthesized per min under optimum assay conditions. For the thymidylate-synthesizing half-reaction, a standard reaction mixture was used except that the dUMP was omitted. E. coli thymidylate synthase reaction was carried out as described previously (11Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Kinetic Analysis—Substrate saturation kinetics were determined for dUMP, CH2H4folate, and NADPH. The kinetic reaction for each substrate was carried out at fixed saturating concentrations of the other two substrates. In all cases, at least 11 different concentrations of the variable substrate were used in each set of experimental assays. Multiple substrate kinetics were determined by varying the concentration of dUMP (0, 2.5, 10, 20, 40, and 75 μm) in the presence of various fixed concentrations of CH2H4folate (10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μm). Product inhibition kinetics for dUMP were determined by varying the concentration of dUMP (0, 2.5, 10, 20, 40, and 75 μm) in the presence of varying fixed concentrations of either dTMP (0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 μm) or H4folate (0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 μm). CH2H4folate (200 μm) and NADPH (2 mm) were present at saturating concentrations. Product inhibition kinetics for CH2H4folate were determined by varying the concentration of CH2H4folate (0, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 μm) in the presence of varying fixed concentrations of dTMP (0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μm) or H4folate (0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μm). dUMP (200 μm) and NADPH (2 mm) were present at saturating concentrations. All the measurements were made in triplicate, and the mean and S.E. were determined using GraphPad PRISM 3.0 software. The Michaelis-Menten equation was used when hyperbolic kinetics were obtained; Km = the substrate concentration giving one-half the maximal velocity (Vmax) (34Tipton K.F. Eisenthal R. Danson M.J. Enzyme Assays: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 1-47Google Scholar). Lineweaver-Burk transformations were used for the determination of the inhibition mechanism. These calculations were fitted using a nonlinear least-squares regression and linear least squares regression computer kinetics program supplied by GraphPad PRISM 3.0 software. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—To determine where chlamydial FDTS was methylated, highly purified CTThyX was used as a source of enzyme in a thymidylate-synthesizing half-reaction. Following incubation for 5 min at 37 °C, SDS sample buffer was added, and the sample was run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The FDTS band was excised and sent to the Scripps Center for Mass Spectrometry (La Jolla, CA, //masspec.scripps.edu) for analysis. Identification of a C. trachomatis Thymidylate Synthase Compl"
https://openalex.org/W1991848404,"P22 is a well characterized tailed bacteriophage that infects Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. It is characterized by a “short” tail, which is formed by five proteins: the dodecameric portal protein (gp1), three tail accessory factors (gp4, gp10, gp26), and six trimeric copies of the tail-spike protein (gp9). We have isolated the gene encoding tail accessory factor gp26, which is responsible for stabilization of viral DNA within the mature phage, and using a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques we show that gp26 is very likely a triple stranded coiled-coil protein. Electron microscopic examination of purified gp26 indicates that the protein adopts a rod-like structure ∼210 Å in length. This trimeric rod displays an exceedingly high intrinsic thermostability (Tm ∼85 °C), which suggests a potentially important structural role within the phage tail apparatus. We propose that gp26 forms the thin needle-like fiber emanating from the base of the P22 neck that has been observed by electron microscopy of negatively stained P22 virions. By analogy with viral trimeric coiled-coil class I membrane fusion proteins, gp26 may represent the membrane-penetrating device used by the phage to pierce the host outer membrane.

This fiber appears to emanate ∼250 Å from the center of the P22 tail, but it has remained essentially uncharacterized. Despite its relative complexity, the P22 tail is remarkably simpler than those observed in many tailed bacteriophages. For instance, in the long-tailed bacteriophage T4, the tail machinery is formed by at least 22 different proteins (7Leiman P.G. Chipman P.R. Kostyuchenko V.A. Mesyanzhinov V.V. Rossmann M.G. Cell. 2004; 118: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 8Fokine A. Chipman P.R. Leiman P.G. Mesyanzhinov V.V. Rao V.B. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6003-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and even in phage T7, another shorttailed phage, the portal vertex structure may contain as many as nine proteins (9Molineux I.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). P22 virus cycle is characterized by the formation of a spherical procapsid (average diameter ∼600 Å), which matures into infectious virus (average diameter ∼650 Å) via a series of dramatic conformational changes (10Thuman-Commike P.A. Greene B. Jakana J. Prasad B.V. King J. Prevelige Jr., P.E. Chiu W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Zhang Z. Greene B. Thuman-Commike P.A. Jakana J. Prevelige Jr., P.E. King J. Chiu W. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), DNA insertion, and protein additions (12Casjens S. Weigele P. Catalano C. Viral Genome Packaging. Landes Publishing, Georgetown, TX2004Google Scholar). The P22 chromosome (∼43.5 kbps) is packaged into the procapsid through the portal protein ring in an ATP-dependent process (13Poteete A.R. Jarvik V. Botstein D. Virology. 1979; 95: 550-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with the aid of a virally encoded terminase complex (gp2 and gp3) (5Botstein D. Waddell C.H. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 669-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). After DNA cleavage and encapsidation of the genome (12Casjens S. Weigele P. Catalano C. Viral Genome Packaging. Landes Publishing, Georgetown, TX2004Google Scholar), the hole in the portal complex, through which DNA enters, is closed by the three tail accessory proteins, which add to the growing tail structure in the following order: gp4, gp10, and finally gp26 (14Strauss H. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This is followed by the attachment of the six tail-spikes (gp9) (15Israel V. J. Gen. Virol. 1978; 40: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which yields the mature infectious phage. gp4, gp10, and gp26 are required for the stabilization of newly packaged DNA within P22 capsids. P22 phages bearing mutations in any of these three genes assemble as procapsids and package DNA but are unstable and lose their DNA within minutes, even inside the infected cell (14Strauss H. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Lenk E. Casjens S. Weeks J. King J. Virology. 1975; 68: 182-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Of the tail accessory proteins, only gp10 and gp4 are required for gp9 addition (5Botstein D. Waddell C.H. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 669-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 14Strauss H. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Tailspikes attach to capsids that lack gp26, while gp10- capsids lack the tail-spike attachment site (13Poteete A.R. Jarvik V. Botstein D. Virology. 1979; 95: 550-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This suggests that gp10, and not gp26, may physically connect the tail-spike protein to the virion. The “DNA-leakage” phenotype shows that gp4, gp10, and gp26 are not directly involved in DNA packaging but are critical to retaining the encapsidated dsDNA inside the capsid. Addition of extracts containing gp26 to P22 gp26- (4+, 10+) particles results in a dramatic stabilization of the capsid, which changes its half-life from the order of minutes to months or years (14Strauss H. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is gp26 that stabilizes the DNA within the capsid, perhaps by plugging the hole through which DNA entered. In the work presented here we have isolated the gene encoding tail accessory factor gp26 and produced recombinant gp26 in Escherichia coli. Interestingly, we show that purified gp26 is a long triple-stranded coiled-coil that resembles class I viral membrane fusion proteins. We propose that gp26 represents the uncharacterized fiber emanating from the center of the phage tail. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—The gene encoding the tail accessory factor gp26 was PCR amplified from P22 DNA with primers 5′-CACGATGCATATGGCAGACCCGTCACTTAATAATCC and 5′-GTAGAGAGGATCCCGATGTTGCGTGTTGGAGTG, cleaved with NdeI and BamHI, and ligated into similarly cleaved plasmid expression vector pET-15b (Novagen, Madison, WI). The resulting plasmid, whose insert was completely sequenced to confirm its structure, was named p26AA1–233.A. It contains P22 DNA bp 8210–8941 DNA (17Sampson L. Casjens S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 18Pedulla M.L. Ford M.E. Karthikeyan T. Houtz J.M. Hendrix R.W. Hatfull G.F. Poteete A.R. Gilcrease E.B. Winn-Stapley D.A. Casjens S.R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1475-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the gp26 protein it expresses has six histidines within the 20 vector-encoded amino acids that are fused to its NH2 terminus. The P22 gene 26 terminates at nucleotide 8911, so 30 bp of gene 14 DNA are present at its 3′-end and its native termination codon is utilized. The recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 cells, in LB broth supplemented with 2.5 g/liter glucose. After growth at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.6, gp26 expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and the culture was shaken at 22 °C for 14 h. Recombinant His-tagged gp26 protein was purified by metalchelating chromatography using Qiagen nickel-agarose beads. gp26 bound to beads was washed with increasing concentrations of imidazole (5–20 mm) and finally eluted with ∼200 mm imidazole. Purified gp26 was then concentrated to 5 mg ml-1 using a Millipore concentrator (cut-off 10 kDa) and analyzed by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 250 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Calibration of the gel filtration column was carried out using high molecular mass globular protein standards (Bio-Rad) consisting of thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.3 kDa). Sedimentation Equilibrium Analysis—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with UV optics, at 4 °C, using a six-channel ANTi60 rotor with 12-mm thick, charcoal-epon centerpieces. The sample channels in each cell contained different loading concentrations of gp26 protein in 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8.0, while reference channels contained the corresponding buffer only. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 rpm until sedimentation and chemical equilibrium were attained. Cells were scanned radially in continuous mode, with data resulting from ten absorbance readings taken at 0.001-cm intervals. Equilibrium was confirmed by no change in scans taken at four hourly intervals. The partial specific volume (0.723 cc/g) and the extinction coefficient for gp26 were calculated from the amino acid sequence (17Sampson L. Casjens S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 18Pedulla M.L. Ford M.E. Karthikeyan T. Houtz J.M. Hendrix R.W. Hatfull G.F. Poteete A.R. Gilcrease E.B. Winn-Stapley D.A. Casjens S.R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1475-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using described methods (19Laue T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 427-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Curve fitting and calculation of molecular mass were done with non-linear least square techniques using program NONLIN (20Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism spectra were collected on an AVIV circular dichroism spectrometer model 62DS at 20 °C. The concentration of purified oligomeric gp26 was ∼6 μm in 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8. The molar ellipticity was monitored using a 1-mm path length cell and 0.50 nm wavelength increments from 195 to 250 nm. The resulting spectra were corrected according to the base line by using above buffer. For thermal unfolding curves the ellipticity at 222 nm was monitored as a function of temperature between 15 and 100 °C. The temperature was increased in 1 °C increments followed by 2-min equilibration. Negative Stain Electron Microscopy—For electron microscopic examination, a ∼10-μl drop of purified gp26 at 0.1 mg ml-1 was placed on a parafilm sheet and allowed to stand for 1.0 min. A carbon-coated electron microscope grid previously glow discharged in a Polaron E5100 vacuum evaporator was placed on top of the drop, and gp26 was allowed to adsorb for 30 s. The grid was then stained for 1 min with 1% uranyl formate, blotted, and allowed to air dry. Specimens were observed and photographed in a Philips CM120 electron microscope operated at 120 keV. Electron microscope images were collected on a Gatan CCD camera at ×52,000 magnification. Bioinformatic Analysis of the Gene Encoding P22 gp26—The P22 gp26 amino acid sequence (17Sampson L. Casjens S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 18Pedulla M.L. Ford M.E. Karthikeyan T. Houtz J.M. Hendrix R.W. Hatfull G.F. Poteete A.R. Gilcrease E.B. Winn-Stapley D.A. Casjens S.R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1475-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was analyzed using a computer-based prediction algorithm developed by Lupas (21Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we found four putative coiled-coil heptads in region 50–152 as well as one conserved heptad in the COOH-terminal region 200–230. Each of these heptads contains the motif abcdefg, where positions a, d, and g are occupied by hydrophobic residues. In gp26 a is always an Ile, d and g show a strong preference for Leu and Val, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). This arrangement is characteristic of heptads found in trimeric coiled-coil proteins (22Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar) and mediates formation of elongated triple-stranded helical structures. Prediction of the secondary structure content with the program PHD (23Przybylski D. Rost B. Proteins. 2002; 46: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) indicates that both regions 50–152 (helix A) and 200–210 (helix B) have high propensity to fold as α-helices. In contrast the NH2-terminal moiety (1–50) and the linker (153–200) are predicted to be random coil. This predicted topology is consistent with a hairpin-like structure formed by a helix A-loop-helix B motif. By analogy with known helical trimeric coiled-coil proteins, three gp26 hairpins are expected to oligomerize via heptad-mediated interactions to generate a trimeric coiled-coil similar to those seen in class I fusion proteins (22Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant P22 Tail Accessory Factor gp26—The gene encoding gp26 was identified as the only open reading frame between P22 genes 10 and 14 (17Sampson L. Casjens S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 18Pedulla M.L. Ford M.E. Karthikeyan T. Houtz J.M. Hendrix R.W. Hatfull G.F. Poteete A.R. Gilcrease E.B. Winn-Stapley D.A. Casjens S.R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1475-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The gene was PCR amplified from P22 DNA and cloned into a prokaryotic expression vector. Recombinant gp26 fused to an NH2-terminal His6 tag was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (see “Material and Methods”). After purification by metal chelating chromatography, gp26 was concentrated to ∼5 mg ml-1 and analyzed by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column, which resolves macromolecules in a molecular mass range of 10–600 kDa. At NaCl concentrations below 150 mm, the tail accessory factor gp26 displayed a strong tendency to aggregate, yielding large species migrating close to void volume. In the presence of at least 200 mm NaCl, gp26 appeared as a more monodisperse major peak eluting after ∼65 ml (Fig. 1C). Molecular mass calibration standards showed that gp26 elutes at an apparent molecular mass of ∼150 kDa. This value is consistent with a hexamer of a globular 26.9-kDa gp26 protein or, alternatively, a smaller oligomeric species with an elongated shape (e.g. trimer, see below). gp26 Is a Trimer in Solution—To determine the exact oligomeric state of gp26 protein in solution, gel filtration-purified gp26 major peak material (Fig. 1C) was subjected to sedimentation equilibrium analysis. This technique provides a shape-unbiased measurement of the protein mass (24Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 47: 297-317Crossref Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the concentration of gp26 protein as a function of position in the rotor cell after equilibrium was attained. Models describing the concentration distribution were fit to equilibrium absorbance versus radius data using the non-linear least squares analysis program NONLIN (20Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The data indicate that gp26 exists as a 80.7 ± 6-kDa species, in striking agreement with the sequence-derived molecular mass of 80.69 kDa for a trimer of the recombinant histidine-tagged gp26 protein (26,895 × 3 = 80,685 Da). The final fit shown in Fig. 2A resulted from the simultaneous fitting of two different concentration distributions. At higher concentrations there was evidence of further aggregation of these trimers. We conclude from this analysis that gp26 protein exists as a trimer in solution under these conditions. Thus, the apparent gp26 molecular mass of 150 kDa measured by gel filtration probably indicates that it is an elongated trimer. Visualization of gp26 by Negative Stain Electron Microscopy— We used negative stain transmission electron microscopy to visualize the gp26 trimer. The elongated shape suggested by gel filtration chromatography and the conservation of four heptads found in the predicted helix (residues 50–152) suggest this putative helix may represent the actual trimerization coiledcoil core of the protein. Micrographs of gel filtration-purified gp26 stained with 1% uranyl formate clearly show a rod-like structure having an average length of about 210 Å (Fig. 2B). These structures are remarkably similar to trimeric coiled-coil class I fusion glycoproteins from Ebola pIIGp2 (25Weissenhorn W. Calder L.J. Wharton S.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6032-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), HIV-1 gp41 (26Weissenhorn W. Wharton S.A. Calder L.J. Earl P.L. Moss B. Aliprandis E. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 27Weissenhorn W. Calder L.J. Dessen A. Laue T. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6065-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the low pH-induced conformation of influenza virus TBHA2 (28Chen J. Wharton S.A. Weissenhorn W. Calder L.J. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12205-12209Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 29Ruigrok R.W. Aitken A. Calder L.J. Martin S.R. Skehel J.J. Wharton S.A. Weis W. Wiley D.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 2785-2795Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For instance, rods of influenza virus HA2, which include a coiled-coil domain of ∼65 amino acids, measure about 100 Å in length (30Bullough P.A. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). gp26, which has a predicted coiled-coil domain of ∼100 amino acids (residues 50–151, Fig. 1B), forms an α-helical rod-structure of ∼210 Å. This suggests that three helices forming the coiled-coil core are fully extended and not folded in bundles, since 100 amino acids are expected to form ∼155 Å of trimeric coiled coil. In addition, a globular domain is also visible at one end of the rod (Fig. 2C), which may be the non-helical regions predicted between residues 1 and 50 or 155 and 210. Structural Stability of Trimeric gp26—Trimeric coiled-coil structures have been reported to have extraordinary thermodynamic stability (22Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). To investigate the folding and stability of recombinant trimeric gp26, we first analyzed gel filtration-purified gp26 by circular dichroism (Fig. 3A). Spectra recorded in 20 mm Na2PO4 and 200 mm NaCl displayed a double minimum at 208 and 222 nm and a maximum at 196 nm, characteristic of α-helices. Quantification of CD data indicates a helical content of ∼55%, which agrees well with the expected secondary structure prediction. As seen in section 3.1, regions 50–152 and 200–230 are predicted to be helical, which correspond to ∼55.7% of the gp26 sequence (130/233 residues). To characterize the structural stability of gp26, we studied the thermal unfolding of the protein by circular dichroism. Denaturing curves were recorded following variation of ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of the temperature. Trimeric gp26 unfolded irreversibly as a single entity (Fig. 3B) with a thermal melting temperature Tm ∼85 °C. The slope of the transition between native and denatured states is sigmoidal in nature, suggesting the denaturation of gp26 is highly cooperative (31Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 299-321Google Scholar). We also examined the thermal denaturation of the protein in the presence of 1% SDS. Strikingly, despite the high concentration of detergent, gp26 trimer unfolded irreversibly with a Tm ∼60 °C. This remarkably high temperature of melting is higher than that observed in most globular proteins (31Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 299-321Google Scholar). The SDS resistance was also confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Both unboiled gp26 and protein boiled for 1 min migrated on SDS-PAGE as a trimeric species of 85 kDa (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 1′ and 2 and 2′). In contrast, no SDS resistance was observed for gp26 boiled for more than 60 s (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 3′ and 4 and 4′). gp26 Forms the Thin Fiber Emanating from the P22 Capsid— We have isolated the gene encoding tail accessory factor gp26 and characterized a recombinant gp26 protein. Our data indicate that gp26 exists in solution as a very stable elongated trimeric coiled-coil ∼210 Å in length. The gp26 trimer is likely held together by four highly conserved heptads bearing the consensus IxxLxxV/Y. In other well characterized trimeric coiled-coil proteins, the side chains of these hydrophobic residues pack against each other in a “knobs-into-holes” manner, forming a continuous extended hydrophobic core (32Crick F.H.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar). Analysis of the thermal stability reveals that gp26 trimer is extraordinarily resistant to heat denaturation and to sodium dodecyl sulfate. The oligomer melts irreversibly with a Tm ∼85 °C, a value comparable with that observed for thermo-stable proteins purified from thermophilic bacteria. It was observed over 30 years ago that isolated P22 capsids imaged by electron microscopy sometimes show an extended needle-like fiber emanating from the base of the tail (6Berget P.B. Poteete A.R. J. Virol. 1980; 34: 234-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Strauss H. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although this fiber has remained essentially uncharacterized, several direct and indirect observations led to the hypothesis that gp26 may indeed form the phage fiber. As mentioned previously, the whole P22 tail (portal vertex structure) is formed by only five gene products. Of these, both portal protein (gp1) and tail-spike protein (gp9) have been extensively characterized, and they are not involved in fiber formation. This implies that the tail-fiber is formed by one or more of the tail accessory factors gp4, gp10, and gp26. The structural characterization presented here indicates that the trimeric putative coiled-coil quaternary structure of gp26 is completely consistent with an elongated fiber adding to the tail of the mature phage. The length and morphology of recombinant purified gp26 (∼210 Å) is also consistent with the P22 fiber observed in electron micrographs of mature P22 phage (5Botstein D. Waddell C.H. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 669-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 6Berget P.B. Poteete A.R. J. Virol. 1980; 34: 234-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Strauss and King (14Strauss H. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) observed that gp26, which is present in two-to-three molecules per P22 virion, sediments with a sedimentation coefficient of ∼5S, consistent with an elongated oligomer of multiple subunits (14Strauss H. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither gp10 nor gp4 are likely candidates to form a tail-fiber. gp10 is believed to form the attachment site for the tail-spike as revealed by 10- phages, which lack both tail-spike and tail-fiber (14Strauss H. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and gp4 appears to be a monomer in solution that binds with high affinity to portal protein 1D. Andrews, S. Casjens, and G. Cingolani, manuscript in preparation. and also has endolysin activity (33Moak M. Molineux I.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1169-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Resemblance of gp26 to Class I Membrane Fusion Proteins— Trimeric coiled-coil is a highly versatile protein folding and oligomerization motif. Coiled-coil structures have been observed in a variety of cellular and viral proteins (34Burkhard P. Stetefeld J. Strelkov S.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). For instance, in class I viral fusion proteins, triple-stranded coiledcoil domains mediate fusion of the viral membrane with the host-cell membrane (22Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Examples of class I fusion proteins are found in various viruses such as orthomyxovirus, paramyxovirus, retroviruses, and filoviruses. These fusion proteins share a similar quaternary structure that is usually described as a trimer-of-hairpins. Each subunit of the trimer presents an amino-terminal (or amino-proximal) highly hydrophobic peptide known as fusion-peptide, followed by a hairpin presenting a helix-loop-helix motif. The long helix following the fusion peptide contains conserved heptads, which hold together the trimeric coiled-coil core. The second shorter helix folds from the outside onto the trimeric coiled-coil core forming a six-helix bundle. A similar coiled-coil helical bundle motif is also found in non-viral membrane fusion devices like the SNARE complex (35Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar), and it has been hypothesized to be a global motif for promoting membrane fusion events (22Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 36Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). gp26 has a resemblance to class I fusion proteins. Both the trimer-of-hairpins topology and trimerization heptads may be present. gp26 exhibits a remarkable thermodynamic stability that is also observed for many class I fusion proteins (22Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Analysis of gp26 primary sequence reveals that the NH2-terminal residues 1–37 are highly enriched in hydrophobic residues, especially at positions 9PVVI12 and 31YLLYVIA37 (Fig. 1B). These hydrophobic regions may represent a prototype of phage fusion peptide (37Del Angel V.D. Dupuis F. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which inserts into the host lipid bilayer. Although it is well known that P22 tail-spike protein bears the endoglycosidase activity required to cleave the O-antigenic repeating units present on the S. enterica cell surface (15Israel V. J. Gen. Virol. 1978; 40: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it remains unknown how the phage inserts a DNA passage structure into the host outer membrane bilayer. In this regard, gp26 tail-fiber could engage in two functions. At the portalproximal side, gp26 may stabilize the phage head by “plugging” the portal protein DNA-pumping channel. At the distal end, gp26 may harbor a class I-like fusion peptide that inserts into the host lipid bilayer. This putative lipid-penetrating activity remains speculative, and the exact nature of the binding interactions taking place within the P22 tail remains to be investigated.

https://openalex.org/W2028721102,"Nuclear accumulation of the complex between β-catenin and proteins of the T-cell factor (Tcf) family is a hallmark of many cancers. Targeting this interaction for drug development is complicated by the fact that E-cadherin and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) bind to overlapping sites on β-catenin. Inhibiting their interactions might actually promote tumor growth. To identify selective β-catenin binding hot spots of Tcf4, E-cadherin, and APC, array technology with peptides of up to 53 amino acids length was used. Interactions were monitored by a quantitative fluorescent readout, which was shown to represent a monitor of true equilibrium binding constants. We identified minimal binding motifs in the β-catenin ligands and showed that most of the 15-mer and 20-mer repeats of APC did not interact, at least when non-phosphorylated, and defined a consensus binding motif also present in APC. We confirmed previously found hot spots and identified new ones. The method allowed us to locate a hydrophobic pocket that was relevant for the Tcf, but not the E-cadherin interaction, and would thus constitute an ideal drug target site.

Alternative splicing and posttranslational modifications further increase the number of different proteins. To understand their function, it is necessary to know the interactions they are involved in. In yeast, with its ∼6000 genes (3Goffeau A. Barrell B.G. Bussey H. Davis R.W. Dujon B. Feldmann H. Galibert F. Hoheisel J.D. Jacq C. Johnston M. Louis E.J. Mewes H.W. Murakami Y. Philippsen P. Tettelin H. Oliver S.G. Science. 1996; 274 (563-567): 546Crossref PubMed Scopus (3208) Google Scholar), different high-throughput methods have defined a total of around 80,000 protein-protein interactions, with the real number probably being somewhat lower (4von Mering C. Krause R. Snel B. Cornell M. Oliver S.G. Fields S. Bork P. Nature. 2002; 417: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar). These searches have also shown that most of the proteins bind multiple other proteins. This may be coupled to diverse and sometimes opposing biological effects. Many interactions are involved in signal transduction pathways leading to differentiation, growth, or apoptosis.However, therapeutic intervention with such complexes has proven to be challenging because protein-protein interfaces are rather large and often flat, such that they are difficult to disrupt with small molecules. However, in some cases, it has been shown that this is possible (5Tilley J.W. Chen L. Fry D.C. Emerson S.D. Powers G.D. Biondi D. Varnell T. Trilles R. Guthrie R. Mennona F. Kaplan G. Le Mahieu R.A.

Even though a growing number of complex structures are available, the relation between interface features and binding strength is not well understood from a theoretical point of view. No parameter observable in crystal structures is correlated to its importance for the interaction. On the other hand, empirical analysis of interfaces has shown that generally only a few residues, the so-called hot spots, contribute the bulk of the binding free energy (9Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 10Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of protein-protein interfaces and the rapid identification of hot spot residues are thus required to understand the thermodynamics and specificity of interactions and to apply such knowledge for the development of specific and potent inhibitory drugs.β-Catenin is an important paradigm for those studies. It exists in two distinct cellular pools, where it carries out two different functions through its binding to a number of diverse proteins. For its role in adherens junctions at the cell membrane, it interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin and with α-catenin. This is crucial for stable cell adhesion (11Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic β-catenin pool serves as a signaling molecule in the Wnt pathway, which plays an important role in development and tissue maintenance and is often found deregulated in cancers (12Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar, 13Bienz M. Clevers H. Cell. 2000; 103: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). In the absence of an extracellular Wnt signal, the cytoplasmic β-catenin concentration is kept low through proteolysis. For β-catenin degradation, its interaction with APC 1The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; Tcf, T-cell factor; CBD, catenin-binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. 1The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; Tcf, T-cell factor; CBD, catenin-binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. in a multiprotein complex is essential (14Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Wnt stimulation results in stabilization of β-catenin, which then translocates into the nucleus, where its complex with Tcf proteins (Tcf1, LEF1, Tcf3, and Tcf4) transcriptionally activates a number of target genes (15Behrens J. von Kries J.P.

Cell. 1996; 86: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar).β-Catenin accumulates in the nucleus of most colorectal tumors and certain other cancers. This is due to mutation in either β-catenin itself or in negative regulators such as APC (17Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The β-catenin·Tcf4 complex plays a central role in oncogenesis (18Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2911) Google Scholar), and its inhibition by dominant negative Tcf4 stops proliferation of colorectal cancer cells and induces differentiation (19van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E. Coudreuse D. Haramis A.P. Tjon-PonFong M. Moerer P. van den Born M. Soete G. Pals S. Eilers M. Medema R. Clevers H. Cell. 2002; 111: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar), proving that β-catenin is an important anti-cancer target (20Kim J.S. Crooks H. Foxworth A. Waldman T. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1355-1359PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, compounds inhibiting the association between β-catenin and Tcf4 have been described (7Lepourcelet M. Chen Y.N. France D.S. Wang H. Crews P. Petersen F. Bruseo C. Wood A.W. Shivdasani R.A. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Targeting β-catenin implies another level of complexity due to its interactions with E-cadherin and APC, which should remain unaffected by potential drugs. Loss of the E-cadherin interaction is causal in the transition from adenomas to invasive carcinomas (21Perl A.K. Wilgenbus P. Dahl U. Semb H. Christofori G. Nature. 1998; 392: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar), so that its inhibition might actually promote tumor metastasis. Because the β-catenin·APC interaction regulates the level of β-catenin in healthy cells and its localization (22Henderson B.R. Fagotto F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), interfering with it might cause inappropriate activation of β-catenin signaling. The structures of β-catenin complexes with Tcf (23Graham T.A. Weaver C. Mao F. Kimelman D. Xu W.Q.

Cell. 2001; 105: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), and APC (27Spink K.E. Fridman S.G. Weis W.I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6203-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have shown that these proteins all bind to the superhelical groove in the central armadillo repeat region of β-catenin and have partially overlapping binding sites, so that selectivity might be difficult to achieve (Fig. 1). The molecules described by Lepourcelet et al. (7Lepourcelet M. Chen Y.N. France D.S. Wang H. Crews P. Petersen F. Bruseo C. Wood A.W. Shivdasani R.A. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) leave the E-cadherin interaction undisturbed but inhibit APC binding, which indicates they need to be optimized. To accomplish this goal, it is necessary to know the specific and differential binding determinants of the respective interactions.For β-catenin, hot spots have been defined by introducing alanine mutations in the armadillo domain and measuring the effect on LEF-1, APC, and conductin binding (28von Kries J.P. Winbeck G. Asbrand C. Schwarz-Romond T. Sochnikova N. Dell'Oro A. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This has identified residues that are equally or differentially important for these interactions. Similarly, hot spots were defined in the catenin-binding domain (CBD) of Tcf (29Fasolini M. Wu X.

Acta. 1999; 1424: M23-M37PubMed Google Scholar).We have analyzed β-catenin binding of Tcf4, E-cadherin, and APC in a systematic and comprehensive manner using peptide arrays and fluorescence-labeled β-catenin. The method allowed us to quickly identify specific and overlapping hot spots for different protein-protein interactions. Peptide array data could be directly correlated to affinity by equilibrium measurements using fluorescence polarization titration. We also further narrowed down the minimal binding fragment of Tcf4 and defined binding regions of E-cadherin. Surprisingly, the peptide array technology also showed that β-catenin binding of APC is not strictly defined by or restricted to its 15-mer and 20-mer repeats and allowed us to more rigorously define β-catenin binding regions in APC.During preparation of the manuscript, our conclusions about binding motifs in APC were corroborated by x-ray structural studies (33Ha N.C.

After induction with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the temperature was lowered from 37 °C to 18 °C for overnight production of the GST fusion proteins. The bacteria were lysed in a Microfluidizer M-110S (Microfluidics, Newton, MA). For human β-catenin, the armadillo domain (residues 151–666) was used. The buffer was 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, and 3 mm dithioerythritol. For cell lysis, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. After affinity chromatography on reduced glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), β-catenin was cleaved off the column by thrombin and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences). For fluorescent β-catenin (bcat-GFP), a GST-β-catenin-(151–666)-enhanced GFP fusion protein was produced as described above, and bcat-GFP cleaved off the reduced glutathione column was used directly. A Cys(Ser-Gly)3 linker was engineered to the N terminus of the human Tcf4 CBD (residues 1–53) for fluorescence labeling. Point mutations were introduced by QuikChange (Stratagene, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). The buffer was 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, and 3 mm dithioerythritol. For lysis, 5 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added. The proteins were purified by reduced glutathione affinity columns, thrombin cleavage of the GST tag on the column, and size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 75. Two constructs of mouse Tcf4, amino acids 652–700 and 628–723, were used. Point mutations and an N-terminal linker were introduced as described for E-cadherin. The buffer was 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 3 mm dithioerythritol. For lysis, 5 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added. Purification was done as described for Tcf4.Synthesis of Peptide Arrays—Membranes with peptide arrays were synthesized by the SPOT technique (35Frank R. Overwin H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar) using an ASP222 automated SPOT synthesizer (Intavis Bioanalytic Instruments AG, Cologne, Germany). Briefly, acid-resistant ACS01 amino-pegylated cellulose membranes (0.6 μmol amino groups/cm2; AIMS Scientific Products, Braunschweig, Germany) were derivatized in a grid of spots of 0.3 cm in diameter, defining the location of the peptides by applying to each 0.1 μl of a solution containing 0.03 m Fmoc-β-alanine and 0.27 mN-acetylalanine, both as in situ formed 1-hydroxybenzotriazole esters. After 2 h of reaction while covered with glass plates, the intermediate membrane parts were blocked with 2% acetic anhydride in N,N-dimethylformamide overnight. Throughout solid phase synthesis, Fmoc-amino acid 1-hydroxybenzotriazole esters were used. After every coupling round, unreacted amino groups were blocked with acetic anhydride, Fmoc-protection was cleaved with 20% piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide, and the terminal amino functions of the growing peptides were stained with bromphenol blue. Finally, all peptides were acetylated at their N termini, and the side chain protecting groups were cleaved by treatment with 82% trifluoroacetic acid, 3% triisobutylsilane, 5% dichloromethane, and 10% water for 16 h.Investigation of β-Catenin Binding to Peptide Arrays—After moisturization with ethanol, peptide membranes were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl) and blocked overnight with 80% T-TBS (Tris-buffered saline + 0.05% Tween 20), 20% Blocking Buffer (Genosys, Deisenhofen, Germany), and 5% sucrose. After washing with T-TBS, 1 μm bcat-GFP in 24 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 240 mm NaCl, 3 mm dithioerythritol, 20% Genosys Blocking Buffer, and 0.05% Tween 20 was added for 2 h at room temperature. After three washing steps with T-TBS, the amount of bound bcat-GFP was quantified on a LA-5000 imager (Fujifilm, Duesseldorf, Germany) using an excitation wavelength of 473 nm and a 510-nm high pass filter for the emitted fluorescence light.Kd Determinations—Exchange of Tcf4 and E-cadherin into a degassed buffer (30 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl, and 10 mm ascorbic acid) was performed by ultrafiltration. For fluorescence labeling, a protein concentration of 100 μm and a 3–5-fold excess of a thiol-reactive fluorophore were used. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the excess fluorophore was removed by buffer exchange to 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 3 mm dithioerythritol. Fluorescence polarization equilibrium titrations were performed in a FluoroMax II spectrometer (Spex Instruments, Grasbrunn, Germany) using 20–200 nm fluorescent protein and adding β-catenin-(151–666). The excitation/emission wave-lengths were 491/513, 494/516, and 346/449 nm for fluorescein, Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, the Netherlands), and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid, respectively. Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed in a MicroCal instrument. A 100 μm solution of the Tcf4-(1–53) peptides was titrated to a 10 μm solution of β-catenin-(151–666). Both binding partners were in the same buffer as described above, plus 10% glycerol and 0.005% Tween 20. Fitting was done with the MicroCal software package using a one-site binding model.RESULTSDesign and Preparation of Peptide Arrays—In order to get a comprehensive view of the energetics and specificity of the different β-catenin interactions with Tcf4, E-cadherin, and APC, we applied a systematic single amino acid replacement strategy. Synthetic peptide arrays as available by the SPOT technique (36Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (917) Google Scholar) can easily be assembled in parallel on a microscale. The longest peptide successfully synthesized thus far by this technique consists of 44 residues (37Toepert F. Pires J.R. Landgraf C. Oschkinat H. Schneider-Mergener J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2001; 40: 897-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because the CBD of Tcf contains an additional 9 residues, its synthesis is, by itself, challenging. However, because the respective CBDs are unstructured (27Spink K.E. Fridman S.G. Weis W.I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6203-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 31Knapp S. Zamai M. Volpi D.

We were therefore confident in extending the synthetic aim to longer sequences.By using the peptide companion software (www.5z.com/csps/), we predicted the absence of difficult synthetic steps. To avoid inhibitory molecular crowding due to the large molecular weight of the product, we found it necessary to reduce the concentration of starting amino functions on the membrane by blending the Fmoc-β-alanine with a 10-fold excess of the elongation-incapable N-acetyl-alanine (data not shown). The completeness of the coupling reaction was assured by repeating the spotting procedure up to four times, if necessary. Additionally, we have chosen a new, acid-resistant cellulose membrane, which allows an extended treatment with high concentrations of trifluoroacetic acid and thus a complete deprotection of the peptides (39Zander N. Mol. Divers. 2004; 8: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Alanine Scan of Tcf4 Binding to β-Catenin—Peptide arrays with individual alanine point mutants of the complete CBD of human Tcf4 (residues 1–53) (24Graham T.A.

The amount of bcat-GFP bound to Tcf4 was quantified with a fluorescence imager. The quantitative evaluation is shown in Fig. 2A. The error bars represent the standard deviation from results obtained with three individually synthesized peptide arrays, showing that interaction measurement by the SPOT method was quite reproducible.Fig. 2Peptide array analysis of the β-catenin·Tcf4 interaction.A, alanine scan. Arrays with all single alanine point mutants of the catenin-binding domain of human Tcf4 (residues 1–53) were incubated with a fluorescent variant of β-catenin (bcat-GFP).

At least 50% reduction in signal resulted from the mutations of Glu17, Leu18, Ile19, Asp23, Leu41,orLeu48. The mutations V49A and E51A in the C-terminal part of the Tcf4-CBD resulted in a >30% signal reduction. These data confirm and extend previous hot spot studies (see below), establishing peptide array analysis as a valuable method to study β-catenin interactions. In contrast, the acidic region from residue 24 to residue 29 of Tcf4, which binds an important β-catenin lysine through alternative conformations (24Graham T.A. Ferkey D.M. Mao F. Kimelman D. Xu W.Q. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), was of only moderate importance for β-catenin binding. Surprisingly, mutation of either Gly13 or Asn15 led to a consistent 30% increase in the amount of bcat-GFP bound to the membrane spot.Solution Assay to Characterize Hot Spot Mutants—We wondered whether peptide arrays as a non-equilibrium method reflect true relative affinities. Thus, recombinant wild-type and mutant Tcf4 peptides were prepared with an additional linker and a cysteine at the N terminus, to allow coupling of a fluorophore. The affinity of the peptides was determined by titration with the armadillo domain of human β-catenin and measurement of the increase in fluorescence polarization due to formation of a large molecular weight complex. Representative titration curves are shown in Fig. 3A for the L12A and V49A mutants, and the results are summarized in Table I.Fig. 3Affinity validation by equilibrium measurements.A, representative examples for affinity measurements by fluorescence polarization of fluorescence-labeled human Tcf4-CBD variants with β-catenin at 20 °C.

Vitamin A binds the zinc finger domain of c-Raf with nanomolar affinity. The retinoid-binding site has been mapped within this structure by scanning mutagenesis. The deduced contact sites were found anchored on Phe-8, counting from the 1st conserved histidine of the zinc finger. These sites agreed with contact amino acids identified by computational docking. The boundaries of a related binding pocket were identified by mutagenesis and partially confirmed by docking trials in the protein kinase C-α C1A zinc finger. They comprised Phe-7, Phe-8, and Trp-22. This trio was absent from the αC1B domain, explaining why the latter did not bind retinol. Reconfiguring at a minimum the two corresponding amino acids of αC1B, Thr-7 and Tyr-22, to conform to αC1A converted this domain to a binder. Deletion of the predicted retinoid-binding site in the full-length molecule created a mutant c-Raf that was deficient in retinol-dependent redox activation but fully responsive to epidermal growth factor. Our findings indicate that ligation of retinol to a specific site embedded in the regulatory domain is an important feature of c-Raf regulation in the redox pathway.

The history of vitamin A research contains a medley of observations concerning widespread physiological roles of retinoids other than the well known functions of retinoic acid in transcription and retinaldehyde in vision (reviewed in Ref. 1Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids, Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Second Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 521-658Google Scholar). Most convincing for the non-nuclear functions of vitamin A are arguments pointing to the evolution of an elaborate retinoid biochemistry and biology in eukaryotic organisms (2Maden M. Acta Biotheor. 1993; 41: 425-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), predating by far the advent of retinoid retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptors and the conservation of the vitamin A metabolites, along with the requisite enzymes, from insects to man. Furthermore, essentially all nucleated cells of higher vertebrates store vitamin A in the form of retinyl esters for ready retrieval and conversion to a variety of metabolites. Because these retinoid products, more often than not, exclude retinoic acid, the question arises as to their purpose. The multitude of defects caused by nutritional vitamin A deficiency, not completely reversible by retinoic acid and ranging from multiple developmental abnormalities (3Wilson J.G. Roth C.B.

In fact, multiple molecular targets emerged when the serine/threonine kinases were found by us to harbor high affinity retinoid-binding sites (11Hoyos B. Imam A. Chua R. Swenson C. Tong G.C. Levi E.

These were encoded within the cysteinerich domains of several PKC 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; cys, cysteinerich domain; EGF, epidermal growth factor; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; WT, wild type; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; cys, cysteinerich domain; EGF, epidermal growth factor; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; WT, wild type; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. isoforms and c-Raf and overlapped with known structures intimately involved with kinase regulation. This is where lipid second messengers bind and activate the conventional and novel PKC isoforms (12Kazanietz M. Wang S. Milne G.W.A. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, the purpose of retinoid-binding sites remained elusive as the classical receptor tyrosine kinase pathways leading to PKC and c-Raf activation operated independently of vitamin A. With the discovery of the alternate pathway of serine/threonine kinase activation via reactive oxygen species (18Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 19Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Kikkawa N.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), this situation changed. We could show that vitamin A itself served as an essential co-factor in redox activation of both PKCs and c-Raf (20Hoyos B. Imam A. Korichneva I. Levi E. Chua R. Hammerling U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23949-23957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Imam A. Hoyos B. Swenson C. Levi E. Chua R. Viriya E. Hammerling U. FASEB J. 2000; (10.1096/fj.00-0329fje)PubMed Google Scholar). The hypothesis was developed that the binding of vitamin A to the cysteinerich domains was required for the controlled oxidation of defined cysteines (22Imam A. Hoyos B. Swenson C. Levi E. Chua R. Viriya E. Hammerling U. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 28-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When absent because of nutritional deficiency or when experimentally displaced by non-functional retinoid antagonists, such as anhydroretinol, PKC, and c-Raf, activation by reactive oxygen species was severely compromised. Jakob et al. (23Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) proposed that in bacteria, cysteine-rich domains are organized into a zinc finger fold that functions as a molecular hinge. The mammalian counterpart, although more complex, also forms a composite zinc finger (24Mott H.R. Carpenter J. Zhong S. Ghosh S. Bell R. Campbell S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8312-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Upon oxidation, the latter has been shown to relinquish the central zinc ions, allowing potentially a conformational change (26Knapp L. Klann E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24136-24145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 27Korichneva I. Hoyos B. Chua R. Levi E. Hammerling U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44327-44331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Bound retinol accelerated this oxidation process. Surprisingly, phorbol ester and diacylglycerol also caused the release of Zn2+ from the PKCα zinc finger (27Korichneva I. Hoyos B. Chua R. Levi E. Hammerling U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44327-44331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, the two chemically dissimilar activators, reactive oxygen species and phorbol ester, nevertheless produced the same outcome: disassembly of the zinc finger, and presumably, a conformational shift. Unfolding has long been postulated as a prelude to the release of the auto-inhibition that the regulatory domain imposes on the catalytic domain (28Heidecker G. Huleihel M. Cleveland J.L. Kolch W. Beck T.W. Lloyd P. Pawson T. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 29Hurley J. Gobler J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the role as co-factor in redox regulation presents a conceptual advance to explain vitamin A action, explorations of biological significance have not kept pace. The reason can be traced to the multitude of target molecules (i.e. the PKC and Raf families) and attendant vitamin A-dependent signal chains. To overcome the difficulties stemming from simultaneous engagement by reactive oxygen species of the diverse vitamin A-dependent signal pathways, we have devised a genetic approach that is predicated on the elimination of retinol-binding sites in select signaling molecules. This was accomplished by mutation of critical contact amino acids of the zinc finger domain. As reported here for the example of c-Raf, the impairment of binding for retinol was paralleled by the selective loss of redox regulation, whereas kinase activation by the classic hormone receptor signals was retained. Additionally, introducing three critical contact residues, copied from the PKCα C1A domain, into the natural non-binding C1B domain conferred retinol binding capacity. Reagents—All-trans retinol, GTPγS, bovine serum albumin (enzyme immunoassay grade), p-nitrophenyl phosphate, glutathione-agarose beads, anti-FLAG® M2-agarose affinity gel, anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit antibody to c-Raf C20-terminal peptide was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antibody was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and l-glutamine without antibiotics. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—The cys domains of c-Raf-(134–190), PKCα C1A-(37–87), and C1B-(102–151) were cloned by PCR into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of GEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). Mutagenesis of FLAG-c-Raf full-length (a gift from Dr. R. J. Davis, University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA) and the cys domains was performed using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Transfection and Cell Activation—COS-7 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described (20Hoyos B. Imam A. Korichneva I. Levi E. Chua R. Hammerling U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23949-23957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To deplete endogenous retinol, cell cultures were first incubated for 30 min with 1 μm anhydroretinol and then cultured with 2 ml of retinoid-free, serum-free, phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose for 2½ days (to deplete retinyl esters (30Eppinger T.M. Buck J. Hammerling U. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1995-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). Where indicated, cultures were restored to vitamin A sufficiency by incubation for 20 min with 1 μm retinol with 0.1% bovine serum albumin as carrier. Subsequently, cells were activated by UV-irradiation for 2 min at 400 milliwatt/cm2 using 312-nm wavelength as described (20Hoyos B. Imam A. Korichneva I. Levi E. Chua R. Hammerling U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23949-23957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), or alternatively, by the classic receptor tyrosine kinase pathway with human EGF at 100 ng/ml. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min after activation and harvested. c-Raf Immunoprecipitation/Kinase Assay—This was carried out as described (20Hoyos B. Imam A. Korichneva I. Levi E. Chua R. Hammerling U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23949-23957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells transfected by calcium phosphate were lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mmp-methanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm vanadate, 30 mm β-glycerophosphate) and precleared. FLAG-c-Raf protein was precipitated using 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and twice with kinase buffer (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm vanadate). The kinase reaction was performed in 20 μl of kinase buffer using 200 ng of kinase-disabled His-MEK(K97M) as substrate, 60 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol). The reaction was carried out for 20 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer. Quantitation was carried out by densitometry using Quantity-One software (Bio-Rad). Phosphotransferase signals were normalized on the amounts of c-Raf immunoprecipitated. Bacteria Growth and Protein Purification—The c-Raf-cys domain WT and mutants were expressed as GST fusion protein in the BL21/DE3 strain of Escherichia coli (Novagen) (11Hoyos B. Imam A. Chua R. Swenson C. Tong G.C. Levi E. Noy N. Hammerling U. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Bacteria were initially grown at 37 °C to an optical density (OD) at 600 nm of 0.5, transferred to room temperature. At an OD660 nm of 0.7–0.8, protein synthesis was induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cells harvested 2 h later. Bacteria were passed twice through a French press, and the GST fusion proteins were recovered from the lysates by affinity chromatography on the glutathione-agarose matrix. Purity by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE was usually >90% by this protocol. Retinoid Binding Assay by Quenching of the Endogenous Protein Fluorescence—Quantitative fluorescence measurement of 250 nm GST fusion protein with retinoid titration at 25 nm increments were performed as described (11Hoyos B. Imam A. Chua R. Swenson C. Tong G.C. Levi E. Noy N. Hammerling U. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in phosphate-buffered saline, purged of oxygen by sparging with helium for 15 min, in a JASCO spectrofluorometer (model FP777). The protein solution was excited at 280 nm, and the protein emission was monitored at 330 nm. Binding constants were calculated by non-linear curve fitting according to the theorem by Norris et al. (31Norris A.W. Cheng L. Giguere V. Rosenberger M. Li E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Qualitative retinol binding assays based on vibronic fine structure determinations were performed as described (22Imam A. Hoyos B. Swenson C. Levi E. Chua R. Viriya E. Hammerling U. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 28-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Ras/c-Raf Binding Assay—Quantitative binding of GST·Raf cys WT and mutants to GTPγS/Ras was measured by the ELISA described by Gosh et al. (15Gosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F.G. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10000-10007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Computational Biology Methods—Docking of retinol into c-Raf-1 and PKCα was carried out using the software Autodock3.05 (32Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9035) Google Scholar) to find potential binding sites of retinol. Autodock used a Monte Carlo simulated annealing technique for configurational exploration with a rapid energy evaluation using grid-based molecular affinity potentials. It thus combined the advantages of exploring a large search space and a robust energy evaluation. The method has proven to be a powerful approach to the problem of docking a flexible ligand into the binding site of a static protein. Van der Waals interactions were calculated using a Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential, whereas the hydrogen-bonding term was modeled by Lennard-Jones directional 12-10 potential. Electrostatic potential energies were calculated with a distance-dependent dielectric function. Chemical preference terms were also added in its scoring function. The program was tested on a number of protein-substrate complexes, which had been characterized by x-ray crystallography (33Goodsell D.S. Olson A.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) as recommended for docking studies. c-Raf structure was taken from Protein Data Bank accession number 1FAR (24Mott H.R. Carpenter J. Zhong S. Ghosh S. Bell R. Campbell S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8312-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and PKCα C1A structure was modeled using 1PTQ (25Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) as template for the program Modeler (34Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10440) Google Scholar) as part of the molecular modeling software package InsightII from Accelrys. NMR structure coordinates for αC1B were kindly provided by Dr. Marcel Luyten (35Hommel U. Zurini M. Luyten M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Modeler is known to produce reliable models when high homologous high resolution crystal structures are available as template, which is the case in our study. Quality of the model was checked with modules available in InsightII package. The GST fusion protein comprising c-Raf amino acids 139–184, spanning the zinc finger domain, encodes one high affinity retinol-binding site (11Hoyos B. Imam A. Chua R. Swenson C. Tong G.C. Levi E. Noy N. Hammerling U. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and a half-site for GTP/Ras recognition (16Gosh S. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 260: 30785-30788Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 36Clark G.J. Drugan J.K. Terrell R.S. Bradham C. Der C.J. Bell R.M. Campbell S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1577-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PKCα C1A and C1B zinc fingers comprise amino acids 37–86, and 102–151, respectively. To maintain a unified numbering system between the c-Raf and PKC zinc fingers, the conserved cysteines and histidines were aligned with each other, requiring a gap for c-Raf since this domain lacks the 4-amino-acid phorbol-binding loop. Numbering began at the 1st histidine. (Fig. 1). To map the retinol-binding site of c-Raf, we converted consecutively all amino acids (except Cys and His of the zinc finger core) to Trp and tested the bacterially expressed mutant peptides for retinol binding by the fluorescence quench assay. This assay registers the amount of bound retinol by the relative decrease of intrinsic protein fluorescence emission caused by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a tryptophan residue and proximal retinol. Titrations of retinol yielded, after correction for inner filtering, Scatchard plots that allowed us to compute the apparent binding affinities by a theorem developed by Norris et al. (31Norris A.W. Cheng L. Giguere V. Rosenberger M. Li E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Examples are shown for WT and the mutants F8W, T33W, and K37W. The first two mutants were unable to bind retinol, as indicated by the absence of quenching of protein fluorescence (Fig. 2), whereas the control K37W mutant yielded binding comparable with WT. Because point mutations can cause broad structural disruptions, it was desirable to ascertain the integrity of each mutated protein. Otherwise, the loss of retinol binding might merely reflect a general structural collapse. The zinc finger domain encodes a face where GTP/Ras docks (17Williams J.G. Drugan J.K. Yi G.S. Clark G.J.

The mutated peptides were tested for retention/loss of GTP/Ras binding capacity by an ELISA devised by Gosh et al. (15Gosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F.G. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10000-10007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, GTP/Ras was adsorbed to ELISA plates and incubated with WT and mutant GST fusion proteins. Anti-GST antibody-conjugated phosphatase was used to detect the amount of bound fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 3 the two retinol-binding loss mutants, F8W and T33W, retained Ras binding capacity comparable with WT, whereas that of the non-permissible framework mutant C34S was at least 4-fold weaker (25Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Table I summarizes the results of a systematic study of all mutants. Of 41 mutations, 12 resulted in substantial loss of retinol binding affinity. However, within this category several, including C34W, S43W, and K45W, were disregarded as they showed weakened Ras binding capacity.Table IScanning mutagenesis of c-Raf zinc-finger to identify contact residues mediating retinol binding Point mutations were systematically introduced in the 45 amino acid stretch from His-139 to Cys-184 comprising the zinc-finger domain (* indicates numbering beginning with first histidine of zinc-finger; a 4-amino-acid gap was allowed for alignment with PKC zinc fingers; ** indicates numbering according to full-length cRaf molecule). Six cysteines and 2 histidines defining the two zinc coordination centers were left unchanged. Mutated peptides were expressed as GST fusion proteins and tested for retinol binding by the quench method (31Norris A.W. Cheng L. Giguere V. Rosenberger M. Li E. Biochim. Biophys.

To account for the mutual competition of retinoids for the same site on zinc fingers (21Imam A. Hoyos B. Swenson C. Levi E. Chua R. Viriya E. Hammerling U. FASEB J. 2000; (10.1096/fj.00-0329fje)PubMed Google Scholar, 37Buck J. Grun F. Derguini F. Chen Y. Kimura S. Noy N. Hammerling U. J. Exp.

Med. 1996; 184: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), retinol was assumed to bind by the β-ionone ring and polyene structure. Therefore the computer was instructed to search for a hydrophobic pocket that would accommodate retinol in headfirst orientation at an energy minimum. A groove was identified in the c-Raf zinc finger with Phe-8 at its head that permitted retinol to dock optimally. Additional contact residues that consistently showed up in the two top ranking docking models were Leu-9, Ala-12, and Arg-30 (Fig. 4, models B and C). These bounded the presumptive pocket that held the head group. In the first model, the residues contacting the tail end were Gly-35, Thr-33, and framework Cys-34 (Fig. 4, model B). Mutations of Thr-33 and Gly-35 both led to impaired retinol binding (Table I). In the alternate model, the orientation and contacts with amino acids for holding the tail end were less well defined. Thus, residues Phe-8 and Thr-33 were identified as retinol contact residues by both docking modeling and site-directed mutagenesis. PKCα zinc fingers are highly homologous in their structures to c-Raf, except for the presence of the loop formed by amino acids 23–26 that defines the phorbol ester-binding site of PKC but is missing in c-Raf. To determine whether the site mapped to a similar topographical region in the C1A domain of PKCα (which is known to bind retinol), comparative docking trials were undertaken. The results identified a phenylalanine at position 8 that furnished the principal contact site for the β-ionone ring. This residue corresponded precisely to Phe-8 in c-Raf. The surrounding amino acids were, however, quite different from those of the c-Raf-binding site, αC1A having Phe-7, instead of Thr-7 found in c-Raf. The PKCα C1B domain does not bind retinol (21Imam A. Hoyos B. Swenson C. Levi E. Chua R. Viriya E. Hammerling U. FASEB J. 2000; (10.1096/fj.00-0329fje)PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, a docking trial yielded no firm assignment of a binding pocket in C1B (Fig. 4, model E). To experimentally confirm predictions from the docking trials, mutations were introduced into the αC1A domain. As shown in Table II, mutating any of the presumptive contact amino acids (Phe-7, Phe-8, or Trp-22) alone was ineffective, unlike in c-Raf, where single point mutations impaired retinol binding significantly. Double mutations of the presumptive hydrophobic amino acids Phe-7 and Phe-8 believed to contact the head group slightly lowered the binding affinity. However, dual substitutions involving either Phe-7 or Phe-8 in combination with Trp-22 drastically diminished retinol binding. Amino acids Thr-7, Tyr-8, and Tyr-22 are characteristic of the non-binding αC1B domain. When copying this motif into the αC1A domain, retinol binding was abolished, whereas phorbol ester binding was preserved (data not shown), indicating that this triple mutation was structurally permissible.Table IIEffect of mutagenesis of predicted contact amino acids of PKCα C1A mediating retinol binding Mutated peptides were expressed as GST fusion proteins and tested for retinol binding by the quench method (31Norris A.W.

https://openalex.org/W2068331430,"Nuclear translocation of constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is a primary mechanism for the induction of cytochrome P450 genes by phenobarbital (PB). We have shown that exogenous expression of the p160 coactivator glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein-1 (GRIP1) in hepatocytes in vivo can mediate PB-independent nuclear accumulation of murine CAR (mCAR). To understand the mechanism of this PB-independent nuclear accumulation, we have examined the mCAR structural determinants of its GRIP1-mediated nuclear localization. Mutations of the xenobiotic response sequence (XRS), which had been shown to block PB-dependent nuclear translocation of human CAR in mouse hepatocytes in vivo, also blocked GRIP1-mediated nuclear accumulation of mCAR in mouse hepatocytes in vivo and further blocked nuclear localization in cultured HepG2 cells. A leucine 326 XRS mutant retained partial transcriptional activity, but mutations of three leucines in the XRS eliminated transcriptional activity in HepG2 cells, suggesting that the translocation function of the XRS overlaps with transcriptional functions. Mutation of the activation function 2 motif, by deletion of the C-terminal 8 amino acids, also reduced nuclear localization by both PB treatment and GRIP1 expression in hepatocytes in vivo, suggesting that either interaction with GRIP1 through this motif or active CAR was required for the nuclear localization. The localization of a DNA-binding domain mutant was essentially unchanged by coexpression of GRIP1, although without GRIP1 coexpression, this mutant expressed exhibited a more nuclear localization compared with wild type. The results are most consistent with a model in which GRIP1 interaction and activation of mCAR in the nucleus result in retention and accumulation of mCAR in the nucleus in untreated animals. The model requires that mCAR is constantly shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm even in untreated animals in which mCAR is predominantly cytoplasmic.

The model requires that mCAR is constantly shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm even in untreated animals in which mCAR is predominantly cytoplasmic. The cytochrome P450 superfamily is composed of a group of monooxygenases that metabolize diverse exogenous compounds such as drugs and toxic agents, as well as endogenous compounds like steroids, fatty acids, and prostaglandins (1Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar). The activities of subsets of cytochrome P450s are induced by xenobiotics. Phenobarbital (PB) 1The abbreviations used are: PB, phenobarbital; CAR, constitutive androstane receptor; mCAR, murine CAR; hCAR, human CAR; PBRU, PB-responsive unit; NLS, nuclear localization signals, DBD, DNA-binding domain; AF, activation function; XRS, xenobiotic response sequence; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; CCRP, CAR cytoplasmic retention protein; GRIP1, glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein-1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TCPOBOP, 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene; RNF, relative nuclear fluorescence. is the prototype of a group of structurally diverse xenobiotic chemicals that induce several subfamilies of cytochrome P450 genes, including CYP2B, CYP2C, and CYP3A, of which the most dramatic effects are observed on the CYP2B subfamily (2Waxman D.J. Azaroff L. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In addition, PB also induces the expression of other xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. PB induction of CYP2B genes has been shown to be mediated by the nuclear receptor constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) (3Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 4Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Zelko I. Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6043-6046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). CAR is unusual among nuclear receptors in having a high constitutive activity when assayed in cultured cells (5Choi H.S. Chung M. Tzameli I. Simha D. Lee Y.K. Seol W. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23565-23571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The initial ligands identified for CAR were androstanes that were reverse agonists and down-regulated CAR activity (6Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Later a subset of PB-like inducers typified by 1,4-bis[3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP) were found to be agonists that enhanced CAR-mediated transactivation in HepG2 cells and potentiated binding of p160 coactivators to CAR (7Tzameli I. Pissios P. Schuetz E.G. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2951-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The cellular location of CAR is key to its role in regulating CYP2B genes in response to PB treatment. In untreated animals, CAR is predominantly present in the cytoplasm, and PB treatment results in the translocation of CAR into the nucleus (8Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 9Min G. Kemper J.K. Kemper B. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, CAR forms a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor and binds to direct repeat-4 nuclear receptor-binding sites in a complex PB-inducible enhancer, termed the PB-responsive unit (PBRU), which leads to activation of gene expression (3Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 11Kim J. Min G. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7559-7567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in continuously cultured cells like HepG2 cells, CAR is located in the nucleus and is constitutively active so that PB induction cannot be studied in these cells (8Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Nuclear accumulation of CAR is the first step in CAR activation and thus plays an essential role in CAR-mediated gene transcription. Protein trafficking between the cytoplasm and nucleus is mediated by nuclear localization signals (NLS) for nuclear import and nuclear export signals for nuclear export, which interact with specific transport receptors (12Cartwright P. Helin K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1193-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Classical NLS or nuclear export signal motifs are not present in CAR. However, mutational analysis of human CAR (hCAR) identified a leucine-rich sequence in the C-terminal region of the protein, termed the xenobiotic response sequence (XRS), which was required for the PB-induced nuclear translocation of hCAR expressed in mouse liver in vivo (10Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The XRS motif resembles nuclear export signal motifs present in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev rather than typical NLS motifs (13Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 14Venkatesh L.K. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1990; 178: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that interaction of the XRS with another unknown protein is responsible for its nuclear localization function (10Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Deletion of the N-terminal portion of hCAR, including the DBD, or mutation of the activation function-2 (AF-2) domain did not affect PB-mediated nuclear translocation of hCAR in these studies. The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadiac acid, which inhibits protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), can also inhibit PB-induced nuclear accumulation of CAR (8Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). PP2A was recruited to a cytoplasmic complex of CAR and heat shock protein 90 in mouse hepatocytes after PB treatment (15Yoshinari K. Kobayashi K. Moore R. Kawamoto T. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, interaction of a protein, CAR cytoplasmic retention protein (CCRP), with CAR was detected by yeast two-hybrid analyses, and overexpression of CCRP increased the relative amounts of CAR in the cytoplasm in HepG2 cells (16Kobayashi K. Sueyoshi T. Inoue K. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It was proposed that CCRP retains CAR in the cytoplasm and that the recruitment of PP2A and the resulting dephosphorylation release CAR from the heat shock protein 90·CCRP complex and facilitate its translocation into the nucleus. Whether CAR is the direct target for dephosphorylation by PP2A is not known. Recently, we found that PB-independent localization of mCAR in the nucleus could be mediated by exogenous expression of the coactivator GRIP1 in hepatocytes in vivo (9Min G. Kemper J.K. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26356-26363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The increased nuclear localization of mCAR and the activation of mCAR by GRIP1 resulted in a dramatic synergistic increase in transcription of a PBRU reporter gene in livers of untreated animals to levels similar to those induced by PB treatment. The mechanism by which GRIP1 causes nuclear localization of mCAR is not known, nor is it known whether the mechanism is related to that of PB-mediated nuclear localization. In the present study, we show that mutation of the XRS blocks nuclear localization of mCAR by GRIP1 in hepatocytes in vivo and also blocks nuclear translocation in cultured cells. Deletion of the C-terminal 8 amino acids to inactivate the AF-2 domain reduces nuclear localization by both PB treatment and GRIP1 expression, whereas GRIP1 expression had little effect on the nuclear localization of a DBD mutant. The results are consistent with a model in which the interaction of GRIP1 with nuclear mCAR and the activation of mCAR by GRIP1 results in nuclear retention. Plasmids—The expression vectors pGEX2TKCAR, pGEX2TKCARΔ8 (CAR(1–350)), and pEGFPC1CAR have been described (9Min G. Kemper J.K. Kemper B. J. Biol.

The mutations in the mCAR mutants, C21A/C24A, L326A, and L322A/L326A/L329A, were introduced by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system in the pEGFPC1CAR or pGEX2TKCAR vectors as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For the deletion mutant CAR(1–328), the sequence encoding amino acids 1–328 was amplified by PCR with pGEX2TKCAR plasmid DNA as template and primers that introduced BamHI and EcoRI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI site of pGEX2TK or the BglII/EcoRI site of pEGFPC1. An NLS sequence was inserted into wild type, L326A, L322/6/9A, and CAR(1–328)-GFP constructs at the N terminus of GFP using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system and the mutagenic primer, 5′-GGTCGCCACCATGCCAAAGAAGAAGCGTAAGGTCGTGAGCAAGG-3′. The inserted nucleotides, which encode the SV40 T-antigen NLS, are underlined. pEGFPC1CAR(1–350) was made by substituting the BamHI/EcoRI fragment from pGEX2TKCARΔ8 for the same fragment in pEGFPC1CAR. All of the mutations and deletions were confirmed by sequencing. The mammalian expression vector pSG5.HA-GRIP1 encoding full-length GRIP1 was obtained from M. R. Stallcup (18Chen D. Ma H. Hong H.

Transient Transfection Assay in Cultured Cells—Human HepG2 and monkey kidney Cos1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml of penicillin at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) in 24-well plates as described (9Min G. Kemper J.K. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26356-26363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For each transfection, 0.5 μg of pPBRU-CYP2C1-Luc DNA (19Park Y. Li H. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23725-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which contains the CYP2B1 PBRU fused to the minimal CYP2C1 promoter and the firefly luciferase reporter gene, 10 ng of pRL-SV40 DNA containing the SV40 promoter and Renilla luciferase gene, and various amounts of mCAR and GRIP1 expression vector DNA were added to each well. After 24 h, the cells were lysed, and the luciferase activities were determined by the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Biotech), and the firefly luciferase value was normalized to the Renilla value for each sample. Localization of GFPs in HepG2 Cells—HepG2 cells grown on coverslips (Corning) in a 6-well plate were transfected with the DNA of expression vectors for the fluorescent proteins with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then permeabilized by incubation for 5 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation in 100 μg/ml DNase-free RNase in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 10 min. Finally the cells were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium with propidium iodide (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence was detected with a Zeiss LSM confocal microscope. The nuclei were identified by red staining of DNA by propidium iodide. The relative nuclear intensity of green fluorescence from the GFP was determined as described (9Min G. Kemper J.K. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26356-26363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) by drawing a line across the center of cell and determining the fluorescence intensities In or Ic for the nucleus or cytoplasm, respectively. Relative nuclear fluorescence (RNF) was calculated as In/(In + Ic) so that a value of 1 is obtained when the fluorescence is 100% nuclear and a value of 0 is obtained when the fluorescence is 100% cytoplasmic. Transient Transfection and Localization of mCAR in Vivo—Plasmid DNA for injection into tail veins of mice was purified by two rounds of CsCl density gradient centrifugation. 6–8 week-old (20–25 g) BALB/c male mice (Harlan Labs) were injected via the tail vein using the TransIT In Vivo Gene Delivery System (Mirus Bio Corp.) as described (9Min G. Kemper J.K. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26356-26363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For transient transfection transcriptional assay, 10 μg of pPBRUCYP2C1-Luc DNA, 0.3 μg of pRL-SV40 DNA, and, as indicated, 1 or 10 μg of expression vector DNA for mCAR or GRIP1, respectively, were injected. 24 h after injection, the mice were sacrificed, the liver tissue was homogenized, and luciferase activity was determined by the dual luciferase assay as described (9Min G. Kemper J.K. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26356-26363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For localization of wild type and mutant mCAR proteins, 5 μg of expression vectors for GFP-mCAR fusion proteins and 25 μg of GRIP1 expression vector DNA were injected. Mice were treated intraperitoneally with isotonic saline or 100 μg/g of body weight of PB 2 h after injection of the DNA, and the animals were sacrificed 4 h later. The livers were cut into small pieces, placed in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Miles, Inc.), and frozen in liquid N2. Frozen sections of 10 μm were prepared with a cyrostatic microtome. Fixation, staining of nuclear DNA with propidium iodide, and detection of fluorescence were performed as described (9Min G. Kemper J.K. Kemper B. J. Biol.

GST Pull-down Assay—The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). 35S-Labeled proteins were synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Corp.). One μg of GST or GST fusion protein was incubated with 3 μl of the lysate containing the labeled proteins in 100 μl of binding buffer (20 mm K+-HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 m KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of protease inhibitors). In some binding reactions, 10 μm TCPOBOP was added to the reactions. After the incubation, the Sepharose beads were extensively washed in binding buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE. Radioactive proteins were visualized by autoradiography. GRIP1 Cannot Induce Nuclear Accumulation of mCAR XRS Mutants in Mouse Liver in Vivo—The XRS motif is required for PB-dependent nuclear accumulation of hCAR (10Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To examine whether the XRS motif is also required for GRIP1-mediated nuclear accumulation of mCAR, the mutations L326A and L322A/L326A/L329A within the XRS and CAR(1–328), which deletes the AF-2 domain and Leu-329 in the XRS, were constructed (Fig. 1). As expected, the interaction of mCAR with GRIP1 in GST pull-down assays was largely inhibited by the deletion of 30 C-terminal amino acids in CAR(1–328) (Fig. 2). Interactions of the L326A and L322A/L326A/L329A mutants with GRIP1 were detectable and only slightly reduced compared with wild type mCAR in incubations without TCPOBOP. Addition of TCPOBOP substantially increased the interaction of GRIP1 with wild type mCAR as expected but did not increase the interaction of GRIP1 with L322A/L326A/L329A and only slightly increased the interaction with L326A. These results suggest that GRIP1 can still bind to the L322A/L326A/L329A and L326A mutants but that these mutations inhibit either TCPOBOP binding or the activating conformational change that results from TCPOBOP binding.Fig. 2Interaction of mCAR variants with GRIP1 in GST pulldown assays. Purification of bacterially expressed GST-mCAR chimera of the CAR variants and synthesis of 35S-labeled GRIP1 in reticulocyte lysates were as described under “Materials and Methods.” 10% of the lysate used in the binding reactions was used in the Input lane. The 35S-labeled GRIP1 was incubated with GST-mCAR variants, the complexes were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose, and the bound proteins were separated by PAGE. Radioactive proteins were detected by autoradiography.

Examples of images of two cells that exhibit predominantly cytoplasmic or nuclear localization for each construction are shown in Fig. 3, and the distribution of relative nuclear fluorescence in 40 randomly selected cells is shown in Fig. 4. When exogenous GRIP1 was coexpressed with the mCAR chimera in hepatocytes in vivo, the distribution of wild type mCAR was shifted toward the nucleus as described previously (Fig. 4, A and B) (9Min G. Kemper J.K. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26356-26363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, coexpression of GRIP1 had little effect on the distribution of the XRS leucine mutants and CAR(1–328) (Fig. 4, C–H), which indicates that the XRS is required for GRIP1-mediated nuclear localization of mCAR. Consistent with previous studies (10Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), these mutants also blocked the PB-dependent nuclear translocation of mCAR. The loss of both GRIP1- and PB-mediated nuclear accumulation of XRS mutant mCARs indicates that the XRS sequence is indispensable for nuclear translocation of mCAR.Fig. 4Cellular localization of wild type and mutant GFP-mCAR chimera in hepatocytes in vivo. Transfection of hepatocytes, imaging, and treatment of animals were as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Cells were transfected with expression vectors for WT GFP-CAR (A, B) or for GFP-CAR mutants, L326A (C, D), L322/6/9/A (E, F), CAR(1–328) (G, H), CAR(1–350) (I, J), or DBM (K, L). 40 cells were randomly selected for each mCAR construction, and the relative nuclear fluorescence was calculated by drawing a line across a confocal plane through the center of the nucleus. The fluorescent intensity of the nuclear part (In) of the line was divided by the sum of the fluorescent intensities of the nuclear and cytoplasmic parts (In + Ic) of the line to calculate the relative nuclear florescence.

Mutation of critical amino acids within the AF-2 of CAR has been shown to eliminate the binding of CAR to p160 coactivators (20Andersin T. Vaisanen S. Carlberg C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 234-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To determine whether interaction of GRIP1 with the AF-2 of mCAR is critical for its GRIP1-mediated nuclear accumulation, we constructed a mutant, CAR(1–350), in which the C-terminal 8 amino acids, which are part of the AF-2 domain of mCAR but not the XRS motif, were deleted. Interaction of this mutant with GRIP1 was largely eliminated as expected (Fig. 2). Coexpression of GRIP1 did not affect the distribution of CAR(1–350) (Fig. 4, I and J) in untreated or PB-treated mice, indicating that the interaction of the AF-2 domain of mCAR with GRIP1 or a transcriptionally active mCAR is required for the nuclear accumulation. Surprisingly only a very modest nuclear accumulation of the CAR(1–350) mutant was observed after PB treatment, much less than that observed with wild type mCAR (Fig. 4J). Cells with fluorescence predominantly in the nucleus (RNF > 0.5) increased slightly from 15 to 20% after PB treatment with the CAR(1–350) mutant, compared with a substantial increase from 5 to 63% with wild type mCAR. This result suggests that an intact C-terminal AF-2 domain contributes to PB-responsive nuclear accumulation of mCAR in contrast to a previous report that mutation of the AF-2 in hCAR did not affect PB-mediated nuclear translocation (10Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The mCAR DNA-binding Domain Is Required for GRIP1-mediated Nuclear Localization of mCAR—The mutation of the AF-2 domain eliminates both the activity of mCAR and the interaction of GRIP1 with CAR. To try to determine which of these two effects was required for the loss of GRIP1-mediated nuclear localization, the activity of mCAR was eliminated by mutating two Cys residues in the DBD of mCAR to Ala. These mutations, which block DNA binding, only slightly reduced the interaction of GRIP1 with mCAR (Fig. 2). In the absence of GRIP1 expression, this mutation resulted in a shift to a more nuclear localization (compare open bars in Fig. 4, A and K). Although the expression of GRIP1 results in a substantial shift of localization of the GFP-CAR proteins for wild type (Fig. 4A), expression of GRIP1 has a modest effect, if any, on the localization of the DBD mutant (Fig. 4K). These results suggest that GRIP1-mediated translocation is reduced in the DBD mutant, but this interpretation is complicated by the change in distribution of the DBD mutant alone, which might mask an effect of GRIP1. PB-mediated nuclear translocation was not greatly affected by the DBD mutant (Fig. 4, K and L). The absence of an effect of GRIP1 on the localization of the DBD mutant would be consistent with the hypothesis that the activity of mCAR contributes to nuclear localization because the DBD mutant is inactive but still interacts with GRIP1. XRS and AF-2 Motifs Are Required for Nuclear Accumulation of mCAR in HepG2 Cells, Regardless of the Presence of GRIP1—In continuously cultured hepatic cells, CAR is primarily distributed in the nucleus in contrast to hepatocytes in vivo (8Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). This partially explains why CAR is constitutively active in these cells and why the addition of PB does not significantly increase its transactivation activity as it does in hepatocytes in vivo or primary cultures of hepatocytes. The XRS motif was originally identified as a xenobiotic response signal in mouse liver, but its role in continuously cultured cells was not reported (10Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Transfected HepG2 cells expressing wild type mCAR displayed strong nuclear localization with 97.5% of cells having a RNF of >0.5 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, point mutations made in leucines in the XRS motif (Fig. 5, B and C) or deletion of the C-terminal 30 amino acids in CAR(1–328) (Fig. 5D) resulted in more than 80% of cells exhibiting primarily cytoplasmic localization (RNF < 0.5). GRIP1 coexpression did not affect mCAR cellular localization consistent with the in vivo results. These results suggest that the function of the XRS motif is associated with basic nuclear import machinery so that mutation of XRS blocks transport into the nucleus in both cultured cells and hepatocytes in vivo. The role of the AF-2 motif in cellular localization in HepG2 cells was also examined (Fig. 5E). The GFP-CAR(1–350) mutant displayed a pattern between those of wild type and XRS mutant mCARs, with 70% of cells, rather than 97.5% for wild type, having an RNF of >0.5. Expression of exogenous GRIP1 did not substantially change the distribution of the CAR(1–350) mutant, which is consistent with the studies in vivo. The slightly increased cytoplasmic localization of the CAR(1–350) mutant is consistent with the idea that active mCAR is retained in the nucleus, but changes in mCAR conformation that reduce cytoplasmic retention cannot be eliminated by these data. Mutations of the DBD in CAR(C21A/C24A) did not greatly aff"

It is the first tetraspanin fusogen and has been shown to directly mediate fusion between disk membranes and opposing membranes to maintain the highly ordered structure of rod outer segments. Localized to the C terminus of human, bovine, and murine peripherin-2 is an amphiphilic fusion peptide domain (residues 312–326) and a highly conserved region upstream of this domain that we hypothesize is essential for fusogenic function.

In this study we wanted to determine whether this proline is essential with the introduction of three additional substitutions of proline with alanine, leucine, and glutamic acid. Wild type, P296T, P296A, P296L, and P296E mutants of peripherin-2 were expressed as His6-tagged full-length proteins in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells.

Tetraspanins belong to a growing family of transmembrane proteins, with over 40 family members identified in mammals, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans (1Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 397-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Similar to other transmembrane 4 superfamily proteins, tetraspanins contain four transmembrane domains. Mutations of tetraspanin genes are associated with various degenerative diseases. For example, the human tetraspanin, TMS4SF/A15, is associated with mental retardation (2Zemni R. Bienvenu T. Vinet M.C. Sefiani A. Carrie A. Billuart P. McDonell N. Couvert P. Francis F. Chafey P. Fauchereau F. Friocourt G. des Portes V. Cardona A. Frints S. Meindl A. Brandau O. Ronce N.

Genet. 2000; 24: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar); furthermore over 60 mutations of the photoreceptor-specific tetraspanin, peripherin-2, result in a variety of retinal degenerative disorders (3Kohl S. Giddings I. Besch D. Apfelstedt-Sylla E. Zrenner E. Wissinger B. Acta Anatomica. 1998; 162: 75-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The unique structural and functional domains of this protein family includes four to six highly conserved cysteine residues linked into two to three disulfide bonds in a highly conserved EC-2 domain. Mutations within this domain result in retinal degeneration and mental retardation. Tetraspanins also contain polar residues in the first, third, and fourth transmembrane domains postulated to be involved in protein-protein interactions necessary to form signaling complexes (4Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1189-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 5Berditchevski F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4143-4151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Todres E.

Thus tetraspanins form homo- and hetero-oligomers resulting in large multiple protein complexes or tetraspanin webs that are involved in the regulation of cell motility, fertilization, cell signaling, and fusion processes. Work in our laboratory has focused on elucidating the role of photoreceptor peripherin-2 as a membrane fusion protein. Although peripherin-2 is first the tetraspanin protein that is directly involved in promoting fusion, several other tetraspanins have important, although poorly defined, functional roles in membrane fusion. CD-9-deficient mice showed impaired egg-sperm fusion (9Le Naour F. Charrin S. Labas V. Le Caer J.P. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2004; 53: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 10Miyado K. Mekada E. Kobayashi K. Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso. 2000; 45: 1728-1734PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, injection of CD81 mRNA into CD9 null mouse oocytes rescued membrane fusion, suggesting that in some instances tetraspanins may functionally substitute for each other. CD81 has also been implicated in human leukemia virus 1 fusion but not HIV 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; wt, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ROS, rod outer segment; PM, plasma membrane; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors. fusion. More recently, both CD9 and CD81 have been shown to promote muscle cell fusion (11Tachibana I. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which these proteins participate in fusion is not clear; however, the notion that these tetraspanins may have intrinsic fusogenic function has not been ruled out. Photoreceptor cells contain a unique set of tetraspanin proteins known as peripherin-2 and its nonglycosylated homologue rom-1 (12Wright M.D. Tomlinson M.G. Immunol.

Purified peripherin-2 promotes membrane fusion with ROS plasma membrane in a cell-free assay system (17Boesze-Battaglia K. Kong F. Lamba O.P. Stefano F.P. Williams D.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6835-6846Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Boesze-Battaglia K. Lamba O.P. Napoli Jr., A.A. Sinha S. Guo Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9477-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This system serves as a model for two key fusion-dependent events in rod cell renewal: disk morphogenesis and disk shedding (19Boesze-Battaglia K. Goldberg A.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 217: 183-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fusion is mediated through a fusion peptide domain within the C-terminal domain of peripherin-2 corresponding to residues 312–326. The amphiphilic, α-helical structure of the fusion peptide is necessary for the formation of a fusogenic oligomer of the peptide to promote the requisite steps in membrane fusion (20Boesze-Battaglia K. Stefano F.P. Fenner M. Napoli Jr., A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1463: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Stefano F.P. Krouse J. Marta P. Boesze-Battaglia K. Exp. Eye Res. 2002; 74: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Homology among human, murine, bovine, Xenopus, and avian forms of the protein in a region upstream of the fusion peptide, residues 294–314, suggests functional importance within this region of the C terminus. A P296T substitution in this region was previously shown to enhance fusion, although the contribution of subunit assembly to the fusogenicity of that mutant was not addressed (22Cohen A.I. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1983; 24: 832-843PubMed Google Scholar). The role of peripherin-2 as a membrane fusion protein is evident in the phenotypes observed in a series of animal models of retinal degeneration. Initially, the rds (retinal degeneration slow) mouse model confirmed that disruption of the RDS tetraspanin gene caused retinal degeneration. rds homozygotes fail to develop photoreceptor outer segments and have limited phototransduction capability, and consequently, the photoreceptors undergo a slow, progressive apoptosis (23Jansen H.G. Sanyal S. J. Comp. Neurol. 1984; 224: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Kedzierski W. Weng J. Travis G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29181-29187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mice heterozygous for the rds defect develop shortened outer segments, which are abnormally phagocytosed. In vivo evidence in support of a peripherin-2 C-terminally mediated function comes from three mouse models of RDS action. Data from a chimeric mouse line expressing the D-2 loop of peripherin-2 in the context of rom-1 suggests that functional efficacy is not restricted to the D-2 loop (26Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13726-13730Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The dominant negative phenotype of the codon 307-del mouse model of RP, in which the C-terminal domain is altered, shows a more rapid retinopathy than the rds –/–, suggesting that the C terminus of peripherin-2 contains a unique functional domain that contributes to the degenerative process (25McNally N. Kenna P.F. Rancourt D. Ahmed T. Stitt A. Colledge W.H. Lloyd D.G. Palfi A. O'Neill B. Humphries M.M. Humphries P. Farrar G.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Lastly, the haplo-insufficiency mouse model argues that two functional alleles are necessary to assemble the ROS. Collectively, although the phenotypes are complex, these in vivo studies coupled with in vitro work (18Boesze-Battaglia K. Lamba O.P. Napoli Jr., A.A. Sinha S. Guo Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9477-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Boesze-Battaglia K. Goldberg A.F. Int. Rev.

Eye Res. 2002; 74: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) provide support for the classification of peripherin-2 as the first tetraspanin fusion protein. In this study we have advanced our hypothesis that the C-terminal domain of peripheirn-2 is a unique functional domain of this protein and possibly other tetraspanins. In this regard we have shown that a single amino acid substitution at position 296 from a proline to an alanine, leucine, or glutamic acid inhibits membrane fusion, whereas substitution to threonine enhances fusion but abrogates normal subunit assembly. Collectively, these studies suggest that this highly conserved region of peripherin-2 may play a role in regulating fusion activity. Preparation of Human Peripherin-2 cDNA Mutants and Expression Constructs—Human peripherin-2 cDNA flanked by NotI restriction sites was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of pGEMEX-2 bacterial expression vector (Promega). Single amino acid substitutions were made using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). wt template DNA was prepared through transformation of JM109 competent Escherichia coli cells (Promega) with 10 ng of the peripherin-2 pGemex-2 construct and subsequent plasmid DNA purification using a Qiaprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). Custom primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. as 100-nmol oligonucleotides using standard desalting. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed corresponding to the coding strand of peripherin-2 to contain ∼50% GC content and a Tm of <75 °C. The mutagenic primers used to change the proline at position 296 to alanine and leucine are indicated by the sequences 5′-GTGTCCAACGCCGAGGAATC-3′ and 5′-GTCCAACCTCGAGGAATC-3′. Generation of the P296E mutant required a 27-base primer: 5′GGTGTGTCCAACGAGGAGGAATCTGAG-3′. The mutagenic primers were 5′-phosphorylated and used in combination with the bottom strand selection oligonucleotide provided in the GeneEditor kit. The mutations were verified by sequence analysis (Davis Sequencing). The 1.1-kb wt and mutant peripherin-2 cDNA NotI fragments were subcloned into the NotI site of the multiple cloning site of the pcDNA 3.1 His B mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The correct orientation of the peripherin-2 NotI fragments in the vector was confirmed through restriction enzyme analysis by digestion with SstI (New England Biolabs). Cell Culture and DNA Transfections—MDCK strain II cells (ATCC) were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential media containing Eagle's salts and l-glutamine, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1% nonessential amino acids at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (all reagents from Sigma). The cells were seeded 2 days before transient transfections in 150-cm2 tissue culture flasks, allowing the cells to reach 70–80% confluency at the time of transfection. Transfections were performed using Optimem I media with no serum or antibiotics. Peripherin-2 used for fusion analyses was obtained from cells transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). For each transfection, 10 μg of DNA and 23 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used. The cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with the transfection complexes, and the medium was replaced with the complete culture medium. Proteins for sedimentation velocity assay were isolated from cells transfected with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). 12 μg of DNA and 108 μl of FuGENE were added followed by incubation for 5 h. Then the Optimem I medium with transfection complexes was replaced with the complete culture medium. In both cases, the cells were harvested by scraping in PBS 48 h post-transfection. Purification of Peripherin-2—Five confluent 150-cm2 flasks of MDCK cells expressing either wt or the proline 296 mutants of peripherin-2 were harvested in PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in native binding buffer consisting of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, and 30 mm octylglucoside, pH 7.4. The cell lysates were sonicated three times for 10 s each time, and His-tagged peripherin-2 His6-peripherin/rds was purified using the Xpress purification system under native conditions (protocol as provided by Invitrogen). Protein was eluted from the column with increasing concentrations of imidazole (50, 200, 350, and 500 mm). The eluted fractions were concentrated using Centricon 30 concentrators to 1 ml. Typically the yield of Xpress peripherin-2 from five confluent 150-cm2 flasks cells was between 0.4 and 1.0 mg. The purity of the protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-Xpress antibody. Velocity Sedimentation Assay—Sedimentation coefficient (S20,w) estimates were made in a Beckman Optima LE-80K ultracentrifuge using a SW 50.1 rotor essentially as described by Goldberg and Molday (26Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13726-13730Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. The purified Xpress tagged wild type peripherin-2 and P296T, P296A, P296L, and P296E mutant samples were loaded onto a 5–20% (w/w) sucrose gradient and centrifuged for 20 h at 40,000 rpm. Sucrose gradient fractions (∼250 μl) were collected from the bottom of the gradient by peristaltic elution through the capillary micropipette. Sedimentation profiles of fractionated sucrose gradients were determined by chemiluminescent Western blotting using anti-X-press antibody (Invitrogen). Digital analysis of Western blots was performed using Kodak Image Station 440CF. The following equations (27Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used to calculate the sedimentation coefficient,STm=(dr/dt)/ω2r (Eq. 1) in which STm is the sedimentation coefficient S at a given temperature T in a solvent, dr/dt is the distance traveled by the sample over time in mm/s, ω is the angular velocity of the rotor in radians/s, and r is the distance from the axis of rotation in mm. S20,w=STmηTm(1/ω−ρ20,w)η20,w(1/ω−ρTm)(Eq. 2) where S20,w is the sedimentation coefficient ST corrected to the “standard state” of water at 20 °C, ηTm and ρTm are the viscosity and density, respectively, of the medium m at the temperature T of the experiment, and η20,w and ρ20,w are the viscosity and density of water at 20 °C. Partial specific volume (ν) of the analyzed proteins were assumed to be 0.83 ml/g (28Goldberg A.F. Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Preparation of F18-labeled Recombinant Liposomes—Vesicles consisting of phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylserine:cholesterol in a 4:4:1:1 mole ratio and 1 mol % F18 were prepared as described (29Struck D.K.

The lipids were cosolubilized in chloroform, dried under N2, lyophilized, and resuspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The lipid suspension was sonicated three times for 3 min each using a probe sonicator to form small unilamellar vesicles. A final volume of 1 ml of vesicles was added to purified Xpress peripherin-2, which was detergent solubilized in 20 mm octylglucoside while vortexing (32Boesze-Battaglia K. Albert A.D. Exp. Eye Res. 1989; 49: 699-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A 1:100 nmol ratio of purified protein:vesicle phospholipid was used for all recombinants. The recombined membranes were dialyzed for 72 h against 10 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl and for 10 h in the presence of Bio-Beads (Sigma) to remove all traces of detergent. The recombined membranes were separated from unincorporated proteins and pure lipid vesicles on a 5–40% (w/w) sucrose density gradient spun at 25,000 rpm overnight at 4 °C. The Xpress peripherin-2-LUV recombinants were isolated from the sucrose gradients. These recombinants were spun down at 60,000 K for 20 min and resuspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, prior to fusion assays. All of the recombinants were assayed for total phosphate (33Partearroyo M.A. Cabezon E. Nieva J.L. Alonso A. Goni F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and protein (Bio-Rad). Preparation of F18-labeled Total Cell Membranes from Peripherin-2-transfected MDCK Cells—Five confluent 150-cm2 flasks of MDCK cells were transfected with wt and mutant peripherin-2 as described above. The cells were harvested by scraping in homogenizing buffer (100 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml of aprotinin, pH 7.4), pelleted (1,000 rpm for 5 min), and resuspended in 4 ml of homogenizing buffer. The cells were then lysed by passage through a 26-gauge needle twice and sonicated three times for 10 s. Homogenized cell lysates were layered onto a single layer 30% sucrose gradient (30% sucrose (w/w) in homogenizing buffer) and spun at 25,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in a SW28 Beckman ultracentrifuge rotor. The plasma membrane fraction was collected from the first interface and pelleted by centrifugation (50,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C), and the membranes were resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The membranes were labeled with 1 mol % F18 (1 mg/ml in ethanol) while vortexing and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in subdued light. Unincorporated label was removed with the addition of 500 μl of 2% bovine serum albumin incubating for 10 min at 37 °C and recovering labeled membranes by spinning at 50,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Preparation R18-labeled of Rod Outer Segment Plasma Membranes (ROS-PMs)—Bovine ROS plasma membrane vesicles were isolated in the dark from frozen bovine retinas (Lawson, Lincoln, NE) as described previously (34Goldberg A.F. Fales L.M. Hurley J.B. Khattree N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42700-42706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Purified plasma membrane was resuspended in 2 ml of 10 mm Hepes, 0.5 m NaCl and labeled with 50 μl of R18 (2 mg/ml solution in ethanol) while vortexing and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to incorporate the fluorescent label. Unincorporated R18 label was separated from labeled PM on a Sephadex G-50 size exclusion column as described (31Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Resonance Energy Transfer Fusion Assay—Fusion between R18-labeled plasma membrane and F18-labeled cell membranes or F18-labeled recombinant vesicles was measured using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay (35Goldberg A.F. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) at room temperature on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B spectrofluorometer (Gaithersburg, MD). Fusion was initiated with the addition of R18-labeled plasma membranes to F18-labeled membranes already present in the well. Fluorescence intensity was measured at λex = 460 nm (F18 excitation) and at λem = 524 nm (F18 emission) and λem = 592 nm (R18 emission) over a 2-min period. The extent of fusion was calculated as the change in R18 intensity over time as described (36Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5370-5378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The change in R18 intensity (ΔR) at a given time was computed as follows. ΔR=(I592/I524+I592)T−(I592/I524+I592)I (Eq. 3) I524 and I592 are the fluorescence intensities at 524 and 592 nm, respectively. The subscripts T and I represent a given time point and the initial time point of each sample, respectively. The percentage of change in R18, indicated in the graphs as the percentage of fusion, was determined by multiplying each ΔR value by 100. The fusion values were normalized for peripherin-2 content. Total cell membrane fusion values represent total fusion/mg of peripherin-2 as determined by densitometry of anti-Xpress Western blots of isolated MDCK cell membranes. In the figures, the percentage of fusion values are normalized to the total percentage of fusion seen with wild type, which is set at 100% of wild type fusion. Western Blot Analysis—MDCK cell lysates, purified peripherin-2, and total cell membranes isolated from MDCK cells were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 2× SDS sample buffer and separated on 10–15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis. For trypsin treatment of total cell membrane fractions, total protein content of the membranes was determined, and a 3× excess μg amount of trypsin was added, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Western blots were probed with a 1:2500 dilution of anti-Xpress primary antibody and a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Supersignal ECL; Pierce). Immunohistochemistry of Peripherin-2-transfected MDCK Cells—For immunohistochemistry, MDCK cells were seeded on sterilized glass coverslips in 6-well plates and grown for 24 h. The cells were transiently transfected with wt or mutant peripherin-2 using Lipofectamine 2000 as described above. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were washed in PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.2 mm CaCl2 (PBS-C/M). For surface staining, the intact cells were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of anti-Xpress antibody for 1 h. The cells were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, rinsed in PBS-C/M, quenched with 50 mm glycine for 10 min at 4 °C, and rinsed in PBS-C/M. The cells were subsequently incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody at a concentration of 10 μg/ml (Molecular Probes). For permeabilized cell staining, the cells were fixed in a 1:1 methanol/acetone solution for 2 min prior to the 1-h incubation with anti-Xpress primary antibody. The cells were rinsed with PBS-C/M and then incubated with secondary antibody as described above. The samples were analyzed on a Zeiss AXIOSKOP fluorescent microscope, capturing images at the magnifications indicated in the figures. Statistical Analysis—Analysis of variance was first performed to test whether there is any difference among groups. When a significant difference was found from analysis of variance, pairwise, post-hoc t testing (Dunnett's t test) of each mutant with wild type peripherin-2 was performed while controlling for the overall type I error. All of these statistical analyses were perform using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Peripherin-2 and Pro296 Mutants Are Heterologously Expressed in and Localized to Intracellular Membranes of MDCK Cells—To determine whether regions upstream of the fusion peptide are necessary for fusogenic function, we generated four human peripherin-2 mutants bearing single amino acid substitutions of proline at position 296. These substitutions include P296T, P296A, P296L, and P296E and were chosen to alter the polarity, size, and charge of this region. The mutants contained an N-terminal Xpress epitope tag and a poly-His6 tag at the N terminus to allow for detection and purification of the proteins. Each of the four Pro296 mutant expression plasmids was transiently transfected individually into MDCK cells. The His6-tagged proteins were purified by nickel column chromatography, and protein expression was assessed by Western blot analysis using anti-Xpress antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, wt peripherin-2 migrated as an 84–86-kDa dimer under nonreducing conditions, with the majority reduced to a 41–43-kDa monomer in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol. Similarly, the four mutants typically migrated as 84–86-kDa dimers under nonreducing denaturing conditions. A fraction of the dimers was reduced to 41–43-kDa monomers in all cases, with all of the expressed P296E protein reduced to the monomeric form. Two mutants, the P296T and the P296L proteins, showed slower migrating proteins consistent with higher order aggregates in the range of 120–220 kDa. Similar pattern of higher order complex formation is not unexpected and was observed in case of insertional mutants: IM5, IM7, and IM11 expressed in COS-1 cells (37Epand R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Thus peripherin-2 was successfully expressed in MDCK cells, and peripherin-2 mutants form disulfide-linked dimers. These observations are consistent with data from other investigations of the protein in vivo and in other cell expression systems (38Travis G.H. Sutcliffe J.G. Bok D. Neuron. 1991; 6: 61-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 39Ritter L.M. Boesze-Battaglia K. Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Khattree N. Chen S.-C. Goldberg A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39958-39967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We next focused our attention on the localization pattern of wt and Pro296 mutants in MDCK cells. As shown in Fig. 2, MDCK cells transfected with wt and Xpress peripherin-2 Pro296 mutants all show a distinct subcellular localization pattern. Peripherin-2, the P296A, P296L, and P296E mutants all exhibited a stereotypical Golgi localization pattern, forming a small cap over the nuclei of expressing MDCK cells. In contrast t"
https://openalex.org/W1963646187,"Multifunctional Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) is a Ser/Thr protein kinase uniformly distributed within the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle. In fast twitch muscle, no specific substrates of CaMKII have yet been identified in nonjunctional SR. Previous electron microscopy data showed that glycogen particles containing glycogen synthase (GS) associate with SR at the I band level. Furthermore, recent evidence implicates CaMKII in regulation of glucose and glycogen metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that the glycogen- and protein phosphatase 1-targeting subunit, also known as GM, selectively localizes to the SR membranes of rabbit skeletal muscle and that GM and GS co-localize at the level of the I band. We further show that GM, GS, and PP1c assemble in a structural complex that selectively localizes to nonjunctional SR and that GM is phosphorylated by SR-bound CaMKII and dephosphorylated by PP1c. On the other hand, no evidence for a structural interaction between GM and CaMKII was obtained. Using His-tagged GM recombinant fragments and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the target of CaMKII is Ser48. Taken together, these data suggest that SR-bound CaMKII participates in the regulation of GS activity through changes in the phosphorylation state of GM. Based on these findings, we propose that SR-bound CaMKII participates in the regulation of glycogen metabolism, under physiological conditions involving repetitive raises elevations of [Ca2+]i.

GM is a striated muscle-specific protein expressed at higher levels in skeletal than in cardiac muscle (7Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. De-Paoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol.

GM (glycogen- and PP1c-targeting subunit) belongs to a family of mammalian glycogen- and PP1c-binding proteins (PPP1R6, PTG, and GL) (9Newgard C.B. Brady M.J. O'Doherty R.M. Saltiel A.R.

However, on SDS-PAGE, GM displays an apparent Mr of ∼160,000 (7Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. De-Paoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13858-13864Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have been identified in the NH2-terminal domain of GM. On the other hand, GM is characterized by the unique presence, at the COOH terminus, of a stretch of hydrophobic residues (aa 1063–1097; see Ref. 7Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. De-Paoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this amino acid sequence is indicative of a transmembrane helix that mediates its binding to SR membranes (7Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. De-Paoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lannér C. Suzuki Y. Bi C. Zhang H. Cooper L.D. Bowker-Kinley M.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Arch. Biochem.

Interestingly, this transmembrane region appears to be involved in the interaction of GM with the SERCA2-regulatory protein phospholamban (13Berrebi-Bertrand I. Souchet M. Camelin J.-C. Laville M.-P. Calmels T. Bril A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A key role for GM phosphorylation in regulation of glycogen synthase (GS) is suggested by a number of observations: (i) cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylates GM on Ser48 and Ser67 both in vitro (3Stralfors P. Hiraga A. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 4Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Eur. J.

Notably, both phosphorylation sites are conserved between rabbit and human GM (7Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. De-Paoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lannér C. Suzuki Y. Bi C. Zhang H. Cooper L.D. Bowker-Kinley M.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and PKA-dependent phosphorylation triggers dissociation of PP1c from GM, thereby inactivating its phosphatase activity (4Hubbard M.J.

(ii) GM is also phosphorylated by GSK3 at Ser40 and Ser44 (15Dent P. Campbell D.G. Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 248: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). (iii) GM is possibly phosphorylated by insulin-dependent protein kinase at Ser48 (14Walker K.S. Watt P.W. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Dent P.

Biol. 2001; 21: 2683-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) further support the possibility that GM may be involved in regulation of GS activity. Recently, using COS7 cells and C2C12 myotubes transfected with GM, Liu and Brautigan (19Liu J. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26074-26081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) found that transfected GM co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous GS. The interaction between GM and GS occurs at specific sites of GM, localized between aa 77–118 and 219–240 (19Liu J. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26074-26081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, thus far, there is no experimental evidence supporting a direct, structural association between GM and GS in native SR membranes. Here, we provide clear evidence that GM associates with nonjunctional SR membranes, where it forms a complex with GS and PP1c. In addition, we demonstrate that GM is phosphodephosphorylated by SR-bound CaMKII and PP1c. Using His-tagged GM recombinant protein corresponding to the aa 40–338 sequence, we also demonstrate that endogenous, as well as exogenous CaMKII are able to phosphorylate serine residue(s) in the NH2-terminal region of GM. The finding that CaMKII is unable to phosphorylate both a truncated GM (aa 69–338) lacking Ser48 and Ser67 and a point-mutated form in which Ser48 is replaced by Ala identifies this residue as a CaMKII target in GM. We thus suggest that Ca2+-calmodulin activation of SR-bound CaMKII might play a pivotal role in the regulation of glycogen metabolism during physical exercise through phosphorylation of GM. Materials—Molecular mass standards were purchased from BDH Laboratories (Poole, UK; molecular weight range 200,000–43,000 or 77,000–12,000).

Okadaic acid was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). All other chemicals were analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Animals and Muscles—New Zealand male adult rabbits were lawfully acquired and properly housed, fed, and taken care of in the Animal Colony of the Department of Experimental Biomedical Sciences of the University of Padova in compliance with Italian Law (Decreto Legge, September 27, 1992, no. 116). The adductor magnus was used as a representative fast twitch muscle (20Damiani E. Sacchetto R. Margreth A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Generation and Purification of His6-GM Fusion Proteins—Total cellular RNA extraction from rabbit adductor and cDNA synthesis were performed as described (21Damiani E. Sacchetto R. Salviati L. Margreth A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). GM cDNA was amplified to generate two forms of GM: GM-(40–338) and GM-(69–338). We used an identical cloning strategy with the same reverse primer and a different forward primer. The primers were designed based on the rabbit GM sequence (7Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M.

The first set of primers amplifies the region that encodes for a 299-aa fragment protein (NH2-terminal residues from aa 40 to 338). The second, amplifies the region from aa 69 to 338. PCR conditions were as follow: 94 °C for 3 min, 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2.5 min for 5 cycles followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2.5 min. The extension step was performed using the Pfu DNA polymerase by Promega. The PCR products, purified using a Qiagen kit, were digested with NdeI and EcoRI enzymes and cloned into the pET 21a+ vector (Novagen). The amplified mutated vector was used for heat-pulsing transformation of Novablue cells. Vector extraction was performed using a QIAprep Miniprep kit (Qiagen) After confirmation of the sequences, the plasmid was heat pulse transferred into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE). Cultures were grown at 37 °C in a medium containing ampicillin. When cultures reached an A550 of 0.5 units, the His-tagged fusion protein fragments were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for3hat 37 °C. His-tagged protein fragments were purified from bacterial lysate by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified protein was quantified by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels, with reference to a calibration curve of bovine serum albumin (0.5–10 μg). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Alanine substitution in GM-(40–338) was generated by introducing a mutation with the use of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The mutagenic primers were designed complementary to opposite strands of the vector and containing two bases mismatched (bold letters) in correspondence of serine 48 to obtain alanine. They were as follow: sense primer 5′-CCG AGC AGA CGA GGT GCG GAA TCT TCT GAA GAG GTC-3′; and antisense primer 5′-GAC CTC TTC AGA AGA TTC CGC ACC TCG TCT GCT CGG-3′. PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 30 s and 16 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 7 min. The amplified mutated vector was used for heat-pulsing transformation of Novablue cells. Vector extraction was performed using a QIAprep Miniprep kit (Qiagen). Mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the region containing the mutation. The cloning strategy of the mutated GM-(40–338)-S48A was identical of that described under “Purification of His-GM Fusion Proteins. Mutated His tag GM-(40–338)-S48A was purified from bacterial lysate by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparative Procedures—To avoid β-adrenergic stimulation and to maximize association of glycogen to SR, rabbits were anesthetized with Zoletil 100 (10 mg/kg per vena) and injected intravenously with propranolol (3 mg/kg), as described by Walker et al. (14Walker K.S. Watt P.W. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After 10 min, the animals were killed by intravenous injection of 1.5 ml of Tanax (Intervet International B.V., Boxmee, The Netherlands) in accordance with procedure approved by the Animal Committee of the University of Padova. Bilateral adductor muscles (a representative fast twitch muscle) were homogenized in 0.3 m sucrose (20% weight/volume), 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Muscle microsomes enriched in content of nonjunctional SR were isolated by the method of Chu et al. (22Chu A. Saito A. Fleischer S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) by centrifuging muscles homogenates at 7700 × g for 10 min. The post-myofibrillar supernatant was recentrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g. The final post-mitochondrial supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 90 min to obtain soluble cytoplasm and a microsomal fraction. SR membranes were further purified by isopycnic sucrose density centrifugation (23Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) to yield four distinct fractions, labeled F1–F4 from top to bottom of gradients. The Ca2+ pump membrane and the junctional face membrane (JFM) were dissociated by incubating F4 membranes with 0.25% detergent Chaps at low Ca2+ and centrifuging, as described (24Damiani E. Tobaldin G. Bortoloso E. Margreth A. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 129-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ca2+ pump membrane corresponded to the solubilized material. Crude JFM was further purified by the method of Sacchetto et al. (25Sacchetto R. Turcato F. Damiani E. Margreth A. J. Musc. Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The membrane fractions were resuspended in 0.3 m sucrose, 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, divided in aliquots, and stored at -80 °C, until used. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 265: 10118-10124Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Measurement of Glycogen—Glycogen content of membrane fractions was measured under the general conditions described by Gomez-Lechon et al. (27Gomez-Lechon M. Ponsoda X. Castell J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Lees et al. (28Lees S.J. Franks P.D. Spangenburg E.E. Williams J.H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1638-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Membranes resuspended (0.5–1 mg/ml) in 0.2 m sodium-acetate buffer, pH 4.8, were incubated at 40 °C with 1750 milliunits/100 μl of amyloglucosidase. At the end of 2 h of incubation, distilled water was added to the assay mixture up to final volume of 1 ml and neutralized with 5.5 μl of 1 n NaOH. Glucose liberated after enzymatic hydrolysis of glycogen was determined by a colorimetric method, using a glucose assay kit (Sigma). A blank of the reaction was performed by incubating SR membranes without amyloglucosidase. A calibration curve was constructed with known amounts of glycogen. Assay of Glycogen Synthase Activity—GS activity was assayed at 37 °C, by the method of Thomas et al. (29Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar), measuring the incorporation of [3H]glucose from UDP[3H]glucose into glycogen. Membranes (final protein concentration, 0.4 mg/ml) were incubated in duplicate in a standard assay mixture (final volume, 50 μl), containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 15 mg/ml glycogen, 2 μm okadaic acid, 10 mm UDP[3H]glucose (specific activity, 0.15 μCi/μmol), and 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate. At the end of 2 min of incubation, the assay mixture was spotted on Whatman C glass filters. The filters were washed twice for 30 min with ice-cold 70% ethanol (10 ml/filter) and dried. [3H]Glucose incorporated into glycogen was measured by liquid scintillation. Background radioactivity was measured in the absence of the enzyme. Zero time controls were prepared by mixing membranes and test mixture on ice and immediately spotting the assay mixture on filters. Phosphorylation Assays—CaMKII phosphorylation assay: Phosphorylation of SR proteins and of GM-(40–338) by endogenous CaMKII was carried out, as described previously (21Damiani E. Sacchetto R. Salviati L. Margreth A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), using a standard medium containing 100 μm free Ca2+ and 1 μm CaM, unless otherwise stated. Incubation was at 30 °C for 30 min. Phosphorylation by exogenous CaMKII of His-tagged GM recombinant fragments was carried out using a commercially available CaMKII (New England Biolabs). Prior to substrate phosphorylation, CaMKII was activated by incubation with ATP/Mg2+ in the presence of CaCl2 and calmodulin as indicated by the manufacturer. Activated CaMKII enzyme was then added to the assay mixture (250 units/50 μl) containing substrate proteins. Composition of phosphorylation assay medium was identical to that used for endogenous phosphorylation. Incubation was at 30 °C for 30 min. PKA Phosphorylation Assay—Phosphorylation by exogenous PKA of SR membranes and of His-tagged GM fusion proteins was carried out at 30 °C as described by Damiani et al. (30Damiani E. Sacchetto R. Margreth A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), except that the incubation time was 30 min. Incubation medium contained 5 μm cAMP (final concentration) and 2.6 μm PKA (5–10 units/50 μl). All of the phosphorylation reactions were started by the addition of 50 μm [γ-33P]ATP (specific radioactivity, 0.10 Ci/mmol) and were terminated by adding SDS-solubilizing buffer to samples. 33P-Labeled protein were detected by autoradiography (Hyperfilm Amersham) or by a Bio-Rad model GS-250 Molecular Imager. Bound radioactivity was quantified by using a β-particle sensitive screen and a model GS-250 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). One unit of exogenous CaMKII and PKA is defined as the amount of enzyme that will transfer 1 pmol of phosphate to specific substrate in 1 min at 30 °C. Protein Dephosphorylation—Isolated SR membranes were incubated at 30 °C with 50 μm [γ-33P]ATP in assay medium for phosphorylation by endogenous CaMKII. After 30 min of incubation, CaMKII was inhibited by 2 μm staurosporin. As reported in detail in the legends to Fig. 5, protein dephosphorylation by endogenous PP1c was carried out in the same medium for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphoamino acid Analysis—GM, 33P-phosphorylated by exogenous CaMKII as described above, was blotted to nitrocellulose membrane, localized by autoradiography, and digested by trypsin. The tryptic peptides were subjected to acidic hydrolysis (6 m HClfor4hat110 °C), and the radiolabeled phosphoamino acids were separated by high voltage paper electrophoresis at pH 1.9, as described by Perich et al. (31Perich J.W. Meggio F. Reynolds E.C. Marin O. Pinna L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5893-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Preparation of Antisera against GM Fusion Proteins—Chicken polyclonal antibodies against the purified His-tagged GM-(40–338) fusion protein were raised, as previously reported by Damiani et al. (32Damiani E. Betto R. Salvatori S. Volpe P. Salviati G. Margreth A. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Guinea pig polyclonal antibodies were raised against a 11.2-kDa peptide corresponding to aa 754–852 of rabbit GM (7Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. De-Paoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunogen was expressed and purified by on-column purification through an IMAC column and was then used to raise the antiserum (Harlan Sera-Lab Ltd., Bicester Oxon, UK). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out as described (21Damiani E. Sacchetto R. Salviati L. Margreth A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). 250 μg of F4 protein, after solubilization, was incubated for 2 h in cold room with the guinea pig anti-GM antibody to (1:1000 dilution). Protein A-Sepharose (40 μl) was added to the mixture, incubated for 1 h, and sedimented using an Eppendorf centrifuge. After washing, the pellets were solubilized with SDS solubilization buffer. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting were carried out, as described (21Damiani E. Sacchetto R. Salviati L. Margreth A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Slab gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and then with Stains All. Apparent Mr values were calculated from a graph of relative mobilities versus log Mr of standard proteins. The blots were probed with: (i) mouse monoclonal antibodies to α-actinin (Sigma), RyR1 (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channel, skeletal isoform; BioMol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), GP53 (a SR glycoprotein of 53 kDa) (ABR, Golden, CO), GS (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), and PP1c (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA); (ii) guinea pig polyclonal antibodies to GM; or (iii) chicken polyclonal antibodies to GM. Antibody binding was detected by immunoenzymic staining (21Damiani E. Sacchetto R. Salviati L. Margreth A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Densitometry of blotted proteins, after immunostaining, was carried out using a Bio-Rad model GS-670 imaging densitometer. GS content was determined by densitometry of proteins immunostained with mouse monoclonal antibody GS, with reference to a calibration curve of purified GS. GM content was determined by densitometry of blots immunostained with chicken polyclonal antibodies to GM, with reference to a calibration curve obtained with purified GM-(40–338). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Muscle cryosections were fixed with paraformaldehyde and immunostained by incubating with primary antibodies to GM and GS (dilution 1:100), followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with TRITC or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Dako), as described by Sacchetto et al. (34Sacchetto R. Damiani E. Margreth A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2002; 22: 545-559Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The images were captured by a B/W chilled CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Japan), transmitted to an interactive image analysis system equipped with image memory (High Fish Beta, version 2.0) and image processing software (Image Processing, version 3.4, Casti Imaging, Venice, Italy). The images were printed on a CP-D1E printer (Mitsubishi, Japan). Localization of GM to SR—When longitudinal cryosections from rabbit adductor muscle were probed with a guinea pig anti-GM antibody, a cross-striated pattern was observed (Fig. 1A). By comparison with phase contrast microscopy, the fluorescent striations were found to correspond to the I band of the sarcomere. Fig. 1B shows that GM co-localized with GS, which also is resident in the I band (35Nielsen J.N. Derave W. Kristiansens S. Ralston E. Ploug T. Richter E.A. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 757-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The overlapping between the two proteins was virtually complete. It was verified that non-specific antibody or secondary alone did not give this fluorescence pattern (not shown). The subcellular localization of GM was further investigated by differential centrifugation of muscle homogenates. The immunoblot analysis shown in Fig. 1C clearly shows that most GM sedimented mostly in the microsomal fraction, which was devoid of contamination by myofibrillar proteins and highly enriched in SR membranes, as demonstrated by the localization of the SR-specific protein markers, RyR1 and GP53. It is noteworthy that GM and GS co-fractionated throughout the entire preparation. A fraction enriched in nonjunctional SR membranes was obtained from muscle microsomes by isopycnic-sucrose density centrifugation (22Chu A. Saito A. Fleischer S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This procedure, at variance with that of Saito et al. (23Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), which yields a much higher proportion of membranes deriving from the terminal cisternae of junctional SR, yields mainly vesicles derived from nonjunctional SR (22Chu A. Saito A. Fleischer S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The nonjunctional SR origin of this fraction was confirmed by [3H]ryanodine binding measurements, carried out at optimal conditions of free Ca2+ (100 μm) and ionic strength (1 m KCl). The specific SR illustrated in Fig. 2A gave a Bmax value of 1.1 pmol/mg protein, which is almost 20-fold lower than that previously reported for pur"

ClpA and ClpX bind substrate proteins through specific recognition signals, catalyze ATP-dependent protein unfolding of the substrate, and when in complexes with ClpP translocate the unfolded polypeptide into the cavity of the ClpP peptidase for degradation. To examine the mechanism of interaction of ClpAP with dimeric substrates, single round binding and degradation experiments were performed, revealing that ClpAP degraded both subunits of a RepA homodimer in one cycle of binding. Furthermore, ClpAP was able to degrade both protomers of a RepA heterodimer in which only one subunit contained the ClpA recognition signal. In contrast, ClpXP degraded both subunits of a dimeric substrate only when both protomers contained a recognition signal. These data suggest that ClpAP and ClpXP may recognize and bind substrates in significantly different ways.

In Escherichia coli, ClpA and ClpX ATPases associate with ClpP peptidase, a serine peptidase unrelated to Clp ATPases, to form the ClpAP and ClpXP proteases. Likewise, the HslUV protease consists of the HslU ATPase and the HslV peptidase. In the presence of ATP, Clp ATPases self-assemble into oligomeric rings. The individual subunits are markedly similar in structure to the subunits of classic AAA+ ATPases (10Sousa M.C. Trame C.B. Tsuruta H. Wilbanks S.M. Reddy V.S. McKay D.B. Cell. 2000; 103: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 11Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. J. Biol.

A Clp protease resembling the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome is formed when the oligomeric ATPase rings associate with one or both ends of a proteolytic component (14Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the proteolytic components ClpP and HslV reveal that the proteolytic sites are within an internal chamber formed by two stacked rings of identical peptidase subunits, resembling the 20 S proteolytic core of the proteasome (10Sousa M.C.

Access to the proteolytic chamber appears to be limited to narrow pores at either end of the stacked rings, which are not large enough to allow passage of a native globular protein. The current mechanistic model proposes that to gain entry to the proteolytic chamber, native substrates are first specifically bound and unfolded by the ATPase components flanking the proteolytic core. The unfolded polypeptide is then translocated through the small pores into the proteolytic chamber (17Larsen C.N. Finley D.

Studies demonstrating that ClpA and ClpX bind substrates specifically and catalyze ATP-dependent protein unfolding provide support for this model (19Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 20Singh S.K. Grimaud R. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In some instances Clp proteases require specificity factors (or adaptor proteins) for recognition of particular substrates. These adaptors act by specifically facilitating the interaction of a Clp ATPase with a substrate that has low affinity for the Clp ATPase. For example, σS, the E. coli stationary phase sigma factor, is not detectably degraded by ClpXP alone. However, the RssB adaptor interacts with both ClpX and σS, thereby delivering σS to ClpXP for degradation, although not being degraded itself (25Zhou Y. Gottesman S. Hoskins J.R. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).

Substrate recognition and binding by the ATPase component is the initial step in protein remodeling and degradation by Clp chaperones and Clp proteases, respectively. Generally, although not exclusively (33Hoskins J.R. Yanagihara K. Mizuuchi K. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Systematic analysis of more than 50 ClpX substrates identified five signal motifs ranging in size from 3 to 6 amino acids (34Flynn J.M. Neher S.B. Kim Y.I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Two of these motifs are C-terminal, and the other three are located at the N terminus of substrate proteins. Additionally, the specific interactions between substrate and Clp ATPase have been examined in great detail for several substrates. One well characterized ClpA substrate is RepA, the P1 plasmid initiator protein. ClpA binds inactive RepA dimers and, in a reaction requiring ATP-dependent unfolding, converts dimers into active monomers that can then bind oriP1 DNA (3Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, when ClpA is associated with ClpP, ClpA targets RepA for degradation. The recognition signal that directs RepA to ClpA is located within the first 15 amino acids of RepA. This signal is both necessary and sufficient to target a protein fused to the peptide for unfolding by ClpA and degradation by ClpAP (35Hoskins J.R. Kim S.Y. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35361-35367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Another well characterized ClpA and ClpX recognition signal is SsrA. A polypeptide is tagged for degradation by the addition of an 11-amino acid peptide encoded by a small RNA, ssrA, when an mRNA lacking an in-frame stop codon stalls on the ribosome (36Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 37Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The SsrA peptide is added to the C terminus of a nascent polypeptide chain by cotranslational switching of the ribosome from the damaged mRNA to ssrA RNA. This signal then targets the abnormal protein for degradation. In E. coli, both ClpAP and ClpXP degrade SsrA-tagged proteins (36Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 38Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1348-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). A study comparing SsrA-tagged proteins of different known stabilities revealed that the efficiency of degradation by ClpXP is determined largely by the presence of the tag, not by the intrinsic stability of the attached protein (21Kim Y.I. Burton R.E. Burton B.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 40Burton R.E. Siddiqui S.M. Kim Y.I. Baker T.A.

Cell. 2003; 114: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It was shown further that when ClpXP interacts with heterodimeric substrates in which only one protomer is SsrA-tagged, only the subunit with the recognition signal is degraded (40Burton R.E. Siddiqui S.M. Kim Y.I. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3092-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The goals of the present study were to elucidate further the mechanisms of Clp-substrate interactions. We investigated the fate of individual subunits of a dimeric substrate interacting with the ClpAP protease to determine whether both protomers may be degraded during one round of binding. The interactions of ClpAP and ClpXP with heterodimeric substrates were also examined. Our findings indicate that the closely related proteases ClpAP and ClpXP may have fundamentally different substrate recognition, binding, and processing mechanisms.

Plasmids and Strains—To construct pET-RepA(Δ25), a repA PCR fragment corresponding to RepA amino acids 26–286, and flanked with NdeI and HindIII sites at the 5′- and 3′-end, respectively, was cloned between the NdeI and HindIII sites of pET24B (Novagen). pET-RepA(Δ25)SsrA was constructed by generating a repA PCR fragment flanked with NdeI and HindIII sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, in which the 3′-oligonucleotide incorporated the coding region for the 11-amino acid SsrA tag followed by a TAA stop codon. This PCR fragment was cloned between the NdeI and HindIII sites of pET24B. pET-RepAhis was constructed by synthesizing a repA PCR fragment lacking the stop codon and flanked at the 5′- and 3′-ends by NdeI and HindIII sites, respectively. The PCR fragment was then cloned between the NdeI and HindIII sites of pET24b, such that a C-terminal His6 tag was added to RepA. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Preparation of RepAhis:RepAΔ25 and RepAhis:RepA(Δ25)SsrA Heterodimers—RepAhis and either RepA(Δ25) or RepA(Δ25)SsrA were mixed together in a 1:5 ratio in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 6 m guanidine HCl. After 15 min at 24 °C, the denatured protein mixture was dialyzed for four h at 4 °C against the same buffer but lacking guanidine HCl.

Substrate-ClpAP complexes were isolated by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column (0.7 × 17 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgOAc, and 0.25 mm ATPγS.

Degradation was measured by monitoring loss of GFP fluorescence at 23 °C for 5 min. To measure the effectiveness of α-casein in inhibiting RepA-GFP degradation by ClpAP, complexes of ClpAP were generated and isolated as above, but without substrate. RepA-GFP (2.5 μg, an amount equivalent to that present in the degradation reactions described above), 6 mm ATP, 10 mm MgOAc, and an ATP-regenerating system were added in the presence or absence of 120 μg of α-casein to 150-μl aliquots of ClpAP complexes. Degradation was measured by monitoring the loss of GFP fluorescence at 23 °C for 5 min.

The mixtures were then applied to a Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration column (0.7 × 17 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer but containing 0.5 mm ATPγS. Fractions containing substrate-ClpA complexes were pooled. ClpP (400 pmol) and 5 mm ATP were added to 200-μl aliquots as indicated in Fig. 5. After 5 min at 24 °C, mixtures were trichloroacetic acid precipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. ClpAP Degrades Both Subunits of a Dimer in One Round of Binding and Proteolysis—According to the current mechanistic model of ClpAP, a recognition signal on the substrate is bound by ClpA. After binding, ClpA unfolds the substrate in an ATP-dependent reaction, then translocates it to ClpP in a second ATP-dependent reaction. The substrate is degraded upon translocation into the proteolytic chamber of ClpP. An aspect of the ClpAP mechanism that remains unclear is the fate of the individual subunits of a multimeric substrate. After binding a dimeric substrate, ClpAP may unfold and degrade one subunit while releasing the other, or both protomers of the substrate may be unfolded and degraded. RepA is a native, dimeric substrate of ClpAP, and previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that one RepA dimer is bound by one ClpA6ClpP14 complex (47Pak M. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4901-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To determine whether one or both RepA protomers were degraded after binding ClpAP, GFP fusion proteins were utilized. RepA-GFP contains the full-length RepA protein with GFP fused to the C terminus, and it exists as a dimer in solution (Fig. 1A and Ref. 33Hoskins J.R. Yanagihara K. Mizuuchi K. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11037-11042Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). RepA(1–70)-GFP contains the 70 N-terminal amino acids of RepA with GFP fused to the C-terminal amino acid, and it exists as a native monomer at the concentrations used here (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Both fusion proteins are substrates for ClpAP (33Hoskins J.R. Yanagihara K. Mizuuchi K. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11037-11042Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 45Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Complexes of substrate-ClpAP were formed in the presence of ATPγS, a poorly hydrolyzed ATP analog, by incubating ClpAP with either [RepA-GFP]2 or RepA(1–70)-GFP. The substrate-ClpAP complexes were then isolated by gel filtration. After the addition of a large excess of α-casein to compete with substrate released from ClpAP, ATP was added, and substrate degradation was measured by monitoring the decrease in GFP fluorescence. If both protomers of the dimer were degraded there would be close to a 100% decrease in fluorescence, whereas if one protomer was degraded and one was released, there would be a 50% decrease in fluorescence. The addition of ATP to ClpAP·[RepA-GFP]2 complexes resulted in an 80% decrease in fluorescence (Fig. 1B). Separation of the reaction mixtures by SDS-PAGE followed by staining and densitometry confirmed that 80% of the RepA-GFP was degraded by ClpAP (data not shown). These data suggest that the binding of dimers to ClpAP results in the proteolysis of both protomers in the majority of complexes. By comparison the addition of ATP to ClpAP·RepA(1–70)-GFP complexes resulted in degradation of 94% of the substrate as determined by the decrease in fluorescence and by densitometry (Fig. 1C and data not shown). This indicates that very few bound monomeric substrates escape proteolysis by ClpAP. The effectiveness of α-casein in competing with free RepA was determined by isolating ClpAP complexes in the absence of substrate, then adding [RepA-GFP]2, excess α-casein, and ATP together and measuring the loss of fluorescence. The presence of excess α-casein resulted in greater than 90% inhibition of RepA-GFP degradation (Fig. 1D), revealing that if RepA-GFP was released from ClpAP, it was unlikely to rebind and be degraded. Taken together, these results demonstrate that interactions between ClpAP and a homodimeric substrate most often lead to the proteolysis of both subunits within a single round of binding. The Presence of a Recognition Signal on One Protomer of a Heterodimer Is Sufficient to Target Both Protomers for Degradation by ClpAP—After demonstrating that ClpAP can unfold and degrade both subunits of a dimer in one round of binding, we then wanted to determine whether degradation of the dimer required the presence of a recognition signal on both protomers. RepA heterodimers were constructed in which only one subunit contained the ClpA recognition signal (Fig. 2A). Previously, we demonstrated that ClpA does not recognize a truncated version of RepA in which the 25 N-terminal residues are removed (RepA(Δ25)), although this mutant protein is a dimer and can be activated for DNA binding both by the DnaK chaperone system and by treatment with chemical denaturants (Ref. 48Kim S.Y. Sharma S. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44778-44783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and data not shown). Heterodimers containing one RepA(Δ25) protomer and one full-length, His-tagged RepA protomer were prepared by mixing RepA(Δ25) and His-tagged full-length RepA in a 5:1 ratio in denaturant and then removing the denaturant. The renatured heterodimers were isolated by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Fig. 2B, lane 3). To demonstrate that the heterodimers were stable, they were diluted 5-fold and mixed with a 5-fold molar excess of non-His-tagged RepA and subjected to another metal affinity purification. SDS-PAGE showed that the RepA(Δ25) subunit coeluted with the His-tagged RepA protomer, indicating that the heterodimeric complex was stable in solution (Fig. 2B, lane 4). We then measured degradation of the heterodimers by ClpAP by monitoring the disappearance of the substrate with time by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis and densitometry. We found that both protomers were degraded, although only one subunit contained the recognition signal (Fig. 3A). The protomer lacking the recognition signal was degraded significantly slower than the full-length RepA protomer (Fig. 3A); RepAhis and RepA(Δ25) were degraded 50% in 7.2 ± 0.4 and 20.8 ± 0.6 min, respectively (calculated from three separate experiments). A slower rate of degradation and a lag phase appear to contribute to the slower proteolysis of the untagged protomer. Both subunits were undetectable when the incubations with ClpAP were extended to 40 min (data not shown). With the same conditions homodimeric RepA(Δ25), which lacks the ClpA recognition signal, was not detectably degraded by ClpAP within 25 min (Fig. 3B). Under the same conditions, more than 80% of RepAhis was degraded by ClpAP (Fig. 3C). Why the subunit lacking the recognition signal was consistently degraded more slowly than the tagged subunit is not known. We demonstrated previously that ClpAP degrades unfolded proteins lacking recognition signals (45Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, one possible reason might be that the RepA(Δ25) subunit is released from ClpAP in an unfolded form and then rebound by another ClpAP molecule. This was tested for by denaturing RepA(Δ25) in guanidine HCl and then measuring degradation following the addition of the denatured substrate to reaction mixtures containing ClpAP (Fig. 4). There was no detectable degradation, implying that if the untagged subunit was released in an unfolded conformation, it was not likely to be rebound and degraded by ClpAP with these conditions. We also measured degradation of the RepAhis:RepA(Δ25) heterodimers after the isolation of ClpA-heterodimer complexes. First, ClpA and the heterodimers were incubated in the presence of ATPγS to generate stable complexes, and then the complexes were isolated by size exclusion chromatography. ClpP was added, either with or without ATP, and degradation of the bound substrate was measured by SDS-PAGE. The results showed that both subunits of the heterodimer were degraded (Fig. 5A). When complexes of ClpA·[RepAhis]2 were similarly isolated and degradation was measured, both subunits were degraded (Fig. 5B). Because RepA(Δ25) lacks a recognition signal, stable complexes between it and ClpA could not be isolated. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the presence of a recognition signal on one protomer of a dimeric substrate is sufficient to target both protomers for degradation by ClpAP. They suggest that the untagged subunit remains associated with ClpAP until it is eventually degraded. ClpXP Degrades Only the Protomer Containing the Recognition Signal When Interacting with Heterodimeric Substrates—In contrast to our observations for ClpAP, ClpXP was previously demonstrated to degrade only the protomer containing the recognition signal when interacting with a heterodimeric substrate (40Burton R.E. Siddiqui S.M. Kim Y.I. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3092-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The ClpXP experiments utilized Arc repressor heterodimers in which only one protomer contained the SsrA recognition signal. To determine whether the contrasting observations with ClpAP reflect different mechanisms for ClpAP and ClpXP or are because of differences in the substrates utilized, we investigated the interactions between ClpXP and RepA heterodimers. RepA is not a natural substrate for ClpXP, so an SsrA recognition signal was added to the C-terminal end of the RepA(Δ25) construct utilized in the ClpAP experiments (Fig. 6A). Without the SsrA recognition signal, ClpX was not able to activate RepA(Δ25) for DNA binding (Fig. 6B). However, ClpX was able to activate the RepA(Δ25)SsrA fusion protein for DNA binding, indicating that RepA(Δ25)SsrA exists as an inactive dimer in solution and is converted to an active monomer by the chaperone activity of ClpX (Fig. 6B). Activation of RepA(Δ25)SsrA by ClpX was similar to activation of RepAhis by ClpA (data not shown). Additionally, ClpA was able to activate RepA(Δ25)SsrA through recognition of the SsrA tag, although ClpA is unable to recognize RepA(Δ25) (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the presence of an SsrA recognition signal on RepA directs the fusion protein to ClpX without affecting the DNA binding activity of RepA. To determine whether ClpXP acted similarly to ClpAP with respect to heterodimeric RepA substrates, RepAhis: RepA(Δ25)SsrA heterodimers were prepared and isolated as described above for RepAhis:RepA(Δ25). As with the ClpAP heterodimeric substrate, the RepAhis:RepA(Δ25)SsrA heterodimers were stable to subunit exchange in solution (data not shown). Incubation of ClpXP with RepA(Δ25)SsrA homodimers resulted in complete degradation of the substrate, demonstrating that SsrA-tagged RepA(Δ25) is proteolyzed efficiently by ClpXP (Fig. 7A). RepAhis homodimers, which lack the SsrA recognition signal, were not detectably degraded by ClpXP, showing that without the SsrA tag, RepA is not a substrate for ClpXP-dependent degradation (Fig. 7B). Importantly, when ClpXP was incubated with the heterodimeric substrate, only the SsrA-tagged subunit was degraded (Fig. 7C). This demonstrates that, unlike ClpAP, ClpXP requires both subunits of a dimeric substrate to contain the ClpX recognition signal for both protomers to be degraded. Taken with the ClpAP data from above, these results suggest that despite their extensive structural and functional homology, ClpAP and ClpXP process substrates in different ways. ClpXP Releases the Nondegraded Subunit of a Heterodimeric Substrate as an Active Monomer—Unlike ClpAP, ClpXP did not degrade both subunits of a heterodimer. To determine whether the protomer that lacked the recognition signal was released as an active monomer or not, the DNA binding activity of the nondegraded subunit was measured. ClpX and ClpXP were incubated with RepAhis homodimers, RepA(Δ25)SsrA homodimers, and RepA:RepA(Δ25)SsrA heterodimers. A portion of each reaction was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis and densitometry. Another portion was used to measure DNA binding. RepAhis homodimers were neither activated by ClpX nor degraded by ClpXP because of the absence of the SsrA tag, as anticipated (Fig. 8A). The presence of the recognition signal on RepA(Δ25)SsrA homodimers resulted in activation by ClpX and proteolysis by ClpXP (Fig. 8B). In contrast, RepAhis:RepA(Δ25)SsrA heterodimers were activated for DNA binding by both ClpX and ClpXP. As expected, activation was reduced ∼50% in the samples incubated with ClpXP compared with those incubated with ClpX because of degradation of the tagged protomer by ClpXP (Fig. 8C). Western blot analysis confirmed that ClpXP degraded the SsrA-tagged subunit but not the subunit lacking SsrA (Fig. 8C). Together, these data show that when only one subunit of a dimeric substrate is degraded by ClpXP, the remaining protomer is released. The data presented here shed light on the mechanism of substrate recognition by Clp ATPases and degradation by Clp proteases. The results demonstrate that ClpAP degrades both subunits of a RepA heterodimer when only one subunit contains the N-terminal recognition signal. One possible mechanism for the action of ClpAP on heterodimers is that the interaction between ClpA and the tagged subunit brings the untagged subunit into close proximity to ClpA, where it is bound through low affinity secondary recognition signals. This model is consistent with previous results from our laboratory demonstrating that although the first 15 amino acids of RepA are sufficient to target a RepA-GFP fusion protein for degradation by ClpAP, fusion proteins containing larger portions of RepA (namely the first 46 or 70 amino acids) are bound by ClpA with higher affinity (35Hoskins J.R. Kim S.Y. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35361-35367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that in addition to the essential Clp recognition signal located near the N or C terminus of the substrate, the presence of secondary recognition signals in the polypeptide may increase substantially the efficiency of substrate recognition and degradation by Clp proteases. The reason why the untagged subunit is degraded more slowly by ClpAP than the tagged subunit remains unexplained (Fig. 3A). It has been shown that protein unfolding is the rate-limiting step in degradation by Clp proteases (21Kim Y.I. Burton R.E. Burton B.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol.

Therefore one possibility is that more cycles of ATP hydrolysis are required to unfold and translocate an untagged subunit compared with a tagged subunit, and thus more time is required. It is possible that the lag in degradation of the untagged subunit seen in Fig. 3A may be caused by preferential unfolding and translocation of the tagged subunit prior to the processing of the untagged subunit. In contrast to ClpAP, ClpXP was only able to degrade the tagged subunit of a RepA heterodimer containing one tagged and one untagged subunit. Similar results were obtained by Burton et al. (40Burton R.E. Siddiqui S.M. Kim Y.I. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3092-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) using another substrate, Arc repressor. In their experiments, one Arc subunit was SsrA-tagged and the other was not; ClpXP only degraded the SsrA-tagged subunit. Thus, with two different substrates, the untagged subunit was not degraded by ClpXP. Our results also show that the RepA subunit lacking the SsrA tag that was not degraded by ClpXP was activated for oriP1 DNA binding. One possible explanation is that the untagged subunit is simply not recognized or bound by ClpXP and is activated as a consequence of the unfolding and degradation of the SsrA-containing subunit. Another possible interpretation is that the subunit without the SsrA tag is unfolded by ClpX coincidentally with the unfolding of the tagged subunit, but instead of being translocated to ClpP, is released and refolds spontaneously. This scenario is consistent with previous work demonstrating that ClpXP, unlike ClpAP, fails to degrade an unfolded substrate lacking a recognition signal (20Singh S.K. Grimaud R. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8898-8903Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These possibilities remain to be tested. In summary, our results demonstrate that ClpAP and ClpXP interact differently with heterodimeric substrates and suggest that there may be a significant difference in the mechanisms of substrate recognition and binding between ClpAP and ClpXP.
