https://openalex.org/W2034876680,"A systematic examination of nitrogen cycling in disturbed forest ecosystems demonstrates that eight processes, operating at three stages in the nitrogen cycle, could delay or prevent solution losses of nitrate from disturbed forests. An experimental and comparative study of nitrate losses from trenched plots in 19 forest sites throughout the United States suggests that four of these processes (nitrogen uptake by regrowing vegetation, nitrogen immobilization, lags in nitrification, and a lack of water for nitrate transport) are the most important in practice. The net effect of all of these processes except uptake by regrowing vegetation is insufficient to prevent or delay losses from relatively fertile sites, and hence such sites have the potential for very high nitrate losses following disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W1963670040,"Trophosome tissue of the hydrothermal vent tube worm, Riftia pachyptila (Vestimentifera), contains high activities of several enzymes associated with chemoautotrophic existence. Enzymes catalyzing synthesis of adenosine triphosphate using energy contained in sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, and two diagnostic enzymes of the Calvin-Benson cycle of carbon dioxide fixation, ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase and ribulose 5-phosphate kinase, are present at high levels in trophosome, but are absent in muscle. These data are consistent with an autotrophic mode of nutrition for this worm, which lives in hydrogen sulfide-rich waters and lacks a mouth and digestive system."
https://openalex.org/W2018855800,"The stable carbon isotope ratios in clam mantle tissues taken from both Gal치pagos and 21 degrees N hydrothermal vent sites were similar to the unusually low ratios of carbon-13 to carbon-12 previously reported for a Gal치pagos hydrothermal vent mussel. In marked contrast to these bivalves, vestimentiferan worm tissues from a Gal치pagos vent had isotope ratios that were higher than those of open ocean biota. These observations suggest that more than one nonpelagic and nonphotosynthetic carbon fixation pathway is of nutritional importance to vent animals, and that at least one of these pathways is common to two geographically separated vent sites."
https://openalex.org/W2073123649,"The obturacular plume, composed of numerous tentacles, is suggested as a site for the uptake of molecular ""food"" by Riftia pachyptila (Pogonophora) from the Gal치pagos Rift; symbiotic bacteria are another possible source of nutrition. Differing organizations of the linings of the five major body cavities of Riftia demonstrate the inadequacy of ""coelom"" as a descriptive term."
https://openalex.org/W2044142450,"The physical and electrical properties of ion-implanted silicon annealed with high-powered laser radiation are described. Particular emphasis is placed on the comparison of materials properties that can be achieved with laser annealing to those which can be achieved by conventional thermal annealing. Applications of these techniques to the fabrication of high-efficiency solar cells, and potential applications of this new technique to other materials areas are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2058547329,Topical application of juvenile hormone analog induces soldier development in the ant Pheidole bicarinata. Soldier induction takes place if the juvenile hormone analog is present during a period of sensitivity that occurs during the last larval instar. Control of worker dimorphism seems to be accomplished through control of timing of metamorphosis. The smallest size at which metamorphosis can be initiated is shifted upward from 1.2 to 1.7 millimeters by exposure to the juvenile hormone analog during the sensitive period.
https://openalex.org/W2060158445,"Extracellular hemoglobin in the whole blood of Riftia pachyptila has a high oxygen affinity (P50 = 1.8 millimeters of mercury at 3 degrees C), a moderate decrease in oxygen affinity at higher temperatures (P50 = 2.7 millimeters of mercury at 14 degrees C), a small effect of carbon dioxide on oxygen affinity (Delta log P50/Delta pH =-0.12), and a high oxygen carrying capacity (up to 11 milliliters of oxygen per 100 milliliters of blood). These characteristics are compatible with the high oxygen demand of chemoautotrophic metabolism in the variable vent environment."
https://openalex.org/W2016524019,"Time series measurements of light scattering were made for 2(1/2) months at 20 meters above the bottom in the western North Atlantic. The highest values recorded with the nephelometer exceeded all previous measurements worldwide. Rapid changes indicated a high degree of activity near the sea floor, and some increases may have been related to atmospheric storms."
https://openalex.org/W2001937250,"Vibration transmission from the prey-catching region to the hub of the unloaded orb web of Nuctenea sclopetaria was measured by laser vibrometry. Compared to transverse or lateral vibrations, longitudinal vibration shows less attenuation and contains more directional information. It is transmitted well throughout the entire frequency range measured (1 to 10,000 hertz)."
https://openalex.org/W2064149730,"A curve is constructed showing changes in sea level at the Santa Monica shelf over the past 18,000 years. The curve is based on radiocarbon dates, sedimentologic data, and high-resolution seismic stratigraphic analysis of late Quaternary terrace deposits. Sea level was 117 meters below its present position about 18,000 years ago. During the first 8000 years of the Flandrian transgression, sea level rose to at least 24 meters, fell to about 46 meters, and then rose to 20 meters, all below present sea level. Subsequently, sea level rose more slowly and without discernible interruption to its present position."

https://openalex.org/W1975258345,A primitive hominid canine recovered at Laetoli by Louis Leakey in 1935 and stored at the British Museum of Natural History adds to our knowledge of dental anatomy in Australopithecus. The specimen was the first adult Australopithecus recovered and the first ancient hominid discovered in eastern Africa.
https://openalex.org/W2060721054,"Kinetics of the reactions of Riftia pachyptila hemoglobin with oxygen were followed spectrophotometrically by stopped-flow and laser flash photolysis techniques. The rate of oxygen dissociation increases eightfold over the range of 5 degrees to 20 degrees C (k = 2.2 sec(-1)at 10 degrees C). Oxygen recombination after flash photolysis was biphasic. The rates of both slow and fast phases of the reaction were independent of temperature from 0 degrees to 20 degrees C(k'fast = 7 x 10(6); k'slow = 1 x 16(6) liter mole (-1) sec(-1)). As the oxygen affinity is relatively temperature independent, analysis in terms of the two-state model of cooperativity requires that the conformational equilibrium constant L decrease by about 50-fold between 3 degrees and 15 degrees C."
