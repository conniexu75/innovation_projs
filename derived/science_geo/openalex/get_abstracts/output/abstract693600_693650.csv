https://openalex.org/W4225266546,"Soon after the emergence and global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineage BA.1, another Omicron lineage, BA.2, began outcompeting BA.1. The results of statistical analysis showed that the effective reproduction number of BA.2 is 1.4-fold higher than that of BA.1. Neutralization experiments revealed that immunity induced by COVID vaccines widely administered to human populations is not effective against BA.2, similar to BA.1, and that the antigenicity of BA.2 is notably different from that of BA.1. Cell culture experiments showed that the BA.2 spike confers higher replication efficacy in human nasal epithelial cells and is more efficient in mediating syncytia formation than the BA.1 spike. Furthermore, infection experiments using hamsters indicated that the BA.2 spike-bearing virus is more pathogenic than the BA.1 spike-bearing virus. Altogether, the results of our multiscale investigations suggest that the risk of BA.2 to global health is potentially higher than that of BA.1."

The phages were engineered to enhance their capacity to lyse M. abscessus and were selected specifically as the most effective against the subject's bacterial isolate. In the setting of compassionate use, the evidence of phage-induced lysis was observed using molecular and metabolic assays combined with clinical assessments. M. abscessus isolates pre and post-phage treatment demonstrated genetic stability, with a general decline in diversity and no increased resistance to phage or antibiotics. The anti-phage neutralizing antibody titers to one phage increased with time but did not prevent clinical improvement throughout the course of treatment. The subject received lung transplantation on day 379, and systematic culturing of the explanted lung did not detect M. abscessus. This study describes the course and associated markers of a successful phage treatment of M. abscessus in advanced lung disease."

Previously, we developed the protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 based on the dimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) of prototype SARS-CoV-2. Here, we developed a chimeric RBD-dimer vaccine approach to adapt SARS-CoV-2 variants. A prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer was first designed to adapt the resistant Beta variant. Compared with its homotypic forms, the chimeric vaccine elicited broader sera neutralization of variants and conferred better protection in mice. The protection of the chimeric vaccine was further verified in macaques. This approach was generalized to develop Delta-Omicron chimeric RBD-dimer to adapt the currently prevalent variants. Again, the chimeric vaccine elicited broader sera neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants and conferred better protection against challenge by either Delta or Omicron SARS-CoV-2 in mice. The chimeric approach is applicable for rapid updating of immunogens, and our data supported the use of variant-adapted multivalent vaccine against circulating and emerging variants."

Many viruses inhibit IFN signaling, but whether bacterial pathogens evade IFN responses remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the Shigella OspC family of type-III-secreted effectors blocks IFN signaling independently of its cell death inhibitory activity. Rather, IFN inhibition was mediated by the binding of OspC1 and OspC3 to the Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM), blocking CaM kinase II and downstream JAK/STAT signaling. The growth of Shigella lacking OspC1 and OspC3 was attenuated in epithelial cells and in a murine model of infection. This phenotype was rescued in both models by the depletion of IFN receptors. OspC homologs conserved in additional pathogens not only bound CaM but also inhibited IFN, suggesting a widespread virulence strategy. These findings reveal a conserved but previously undescribed molecular mechanism of IFN inhibition and demonstrate the critical role of Ca2+ and IFN targeting in bacterial pathogenesis.

Interferons (IFNs) are families of immunomodulatory cytokines produced in response to infection (De Weerd and Nguyen, 2012De Weerd N.A. Nguyen T. The interferons and their receptors—distribution and regulation.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2012; 90: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Type II (IFNγ) is the archetypal antibacterial IFN. Type I (IFNαs, β) and type III IFNs (IFNλ1-4) have been historically studied for their antiviral properties, but evidence of their antibacterial roles is emerging (Burke et al., 2020Burke T.P.

IFNs induce hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), promoting clearance of pathogens and protection from infection. A few ISGs have been established to have direct antibacterial functions (Gaudet et al., 2021Gaudet R.G. Zhu S. Halder A. Kim B.-H. Bradfield C.J. Huang S. Xu D. Mamiñska A. Nguyen T.N.

For example, human guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1) serves as a lipopolysaccharide sensor to activate Caspase 4. This facilitates activation of the noncanonical inflammasome, leading to inflammatory cell death and clearance of intracellular bacteria such as Shigella (Kutsch et al., 2020Kutsch M. Coers J.

Shigella spp. are Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae, and the major etiological agents of bacillary dysentery, also called shigellosis (Trofa et al., 1999Trofa A.F. Ueno-Olsen H. Oiwa R. Yoshikawa M. Dr. Kiyoshi Shiga: discoverer of the dysentery bacillus.Clin. Infect. Dis. 1999; 29: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Shigellosis, predominantly caused by Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei, is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide (Anderson et al., 2017Anderson M.C. Vonaesch P.

Following entry into the gastrointestinal tract, Shigella spp invade colonic epithelial cells, rupture their vacuole, and replicate in the cytosol. The pathogenesis of Shigella is dependent on its type III secretion system (T3SS), which is encoded on a large virulence plasmid. The T3SS serves as a molecular needle, injecting ∽30 effectors, which are highly conserved among Shigella spp., into the host cell to modulate multiple facets of cell physiology and establish a viable niche for infection (Bajunaid et al., 2020Bajunaid W.

Dis. 2019; 77: 1-9Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Among these effectors, the OspC family is emerging as a potent modulator of host immune responses. It comprises the following 3 members: OspC1, OspC2, and OspC3. Despite sharing a high degree of sequence similarity, distinct functions of these effectors have been described. OspC1 was initially shown to promote neutrophil migration (Zurawski et al., 2006Zurawski D.V. Mitsuhata C. Mumy K.L. McCormick B.A. Maurelli A.T. OspF and OspC1 are Shigella flexneri type III secretion system effectors that are required for postinvasion aspects of virulence.Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 5964-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recent evidence demonstrated that OspC1 also inhibits Caspase 3/7-induced apoptosis, prolonging the survival of infected epithelial cells (Ashida et al., 2020Ashida H. Sasakawa C. Suzuki T. A unique bacterial tactic to circumvent the cell death crosstalk induced by blockade of caspase-8.EMBO J. 2020; 39: e104469Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). OspC3 blocks Caspase 4/11-mediated inflammatory cell death (Kobayashi et al., 2013Kobayashi T. Ogawa M. Sanada T. Mimuro H. Kim M. Ashida H. Akakura R. Yoshida M. Kawalec M.

Shigella OspC3 suppresses murine cytosolic LPS sensing.iScience. 2021; 24: 102910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), maintaining the bacterium’s epithelial niche during infection. Viruses are extremely sensitive to IFN-induced responses, and almost all have evolved mechanisms that target components of IFN signaling cascades. Whether bacterial pathogens are capable of the same functions remains unknown. The emerging role of ISGs in the restriction of infection by intracellular bacteria such as Shigella led us to hypothesize that Shigella might counteract ISG expression. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved family of OspC effectors blocks IFN responses through binding and inhibition of the host Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM) (Berchtold and Villalobo, 2014Berchtold M.W. Villalobo A. The many faces of calmodulin in cell proliferation, programmed cell death, autophagy, and cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1843: 398-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We show that a Shigella strain lacking OspC1 and OspC3 (ΔospC1/C3) strain is attenuated in cell culture and in the murine gut in an IFN-dependent manner, highlighting the importance of IFN inhibition as a virulence strategy. Our data provide a mandate for future work on ISG targeting by bacterial pathogens but also noncanonical IFN inhibition as a common virulence mechanism. To identify bacterial strategies that interfere with IFN signaling, we monitored the expression of ISGs in response to Shigella infection. We selected HeLa cells for these experiments as they show limited ISG induction in response to infection with Shigella but respond robustly to exogenous IFN (Figure S1A). Cells were infected with wild-type (WT) S. sonnei or a strain lacking a functional T3SS (ΔmxiD). After 30 min, cells were treated with IFNβ for 4.5 h, and ISG expression was quantified by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (Figure 1A). As expected, the ISGs encoding Viperin and interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide 1 (IFIT1) were induced when uninfected (UI) cells were treated with IFNβ (Figure 1B). Infection with WT Shigella significantly inhibited ISG expression in response to IFNβ. This inhibition depended on the presence of a functional T3SS, as ΔmxiD Shigella infection did not suppress Viperin or IFIT1 expression. This finding implicates T3SS effectors as potential IFN signaling inhibitors. To identify candidate effectors, we utilized a 293T cell line engineered to express luciferase under the control of an interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) sequence, which is activated by type I and III IFNs (Odendall and Kagan, 2015Odendall C.

Cells expressing individual green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged effectors were treated with IFNβ for 18 h (Figure 1C). As a positive control, cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing Chikungunya virus (ChikV) NSP2, a protein known to block IFN signaling (Fros et al., 2010Fros J.J. Liu W.J. Prow N.A. Geertsema C. Ligtenberg M. Vanlandingham D.L. Schnettler E. Vlak J.M. Suhrbier A. Khromykh A.A. Pijlman G.P.

Expression of several effectors (blue bars) led to IFN inhibition at a level comparable with that mediated by NSP2 (Figure 1D). We chose to follow up on the OspC effector family that had previously been shown to modulate immune pathways (Ashida et al., 2020Ashida H. Sasakawa C. Suzuki T.

To determine the spectrum of IFN signaling pathways impacted by OspC family members, we examined the ability of each effector to interfere with type I, II, or III IFN activity. 293T cells cotransfected with each OspC effector and an ISRE reporter were treated with type I IFN (IFNα, IFNβ) or type III IFN (IFNλ1) (Figures 1C and 1E). Given that IFNγ induces a different set of ISGs that contain γ-activated sequences (GAS), IFNγ signaling was assessed following expression of a GAS reporter in HeLa cells (Figures 1C and 1E). ChikV NSP2 was used as a positive control, whereas OspD1, an effector that displayed no inhibition of ISRE in our initial screen (Figure 1D), served as a negative control. We found that OspC1 and OspC3 blocked signaling downstream of increasing concentrations of IFNs from all 3 families (Figure 1E). OspC2 potently inhibited IFNλ1 signaling but was far less efficient at blocking type I IFN signaling and unable to inhibit IFNγ. We next confirmed that OspC effectors block the expression of endogenous ISGs by monitoring Viperin mRNA expression by qRT-PCR in OspC-expressing cells postexposure to IFNβ or IFNλ1 (Figure 1F). Consistent with the reporter analyses described above, OspC1 and OspC3 displayed the most potent ISG suppressive activity. To determine if OspCs globally suppressed ISG expression, we employed RNA-seq analysis of cells expressing the empty GFP control, OspC1 or OspC3, treated or not with IFNβ. We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) comparing IFNβ-treated GFP with OspC1- or OspC3-expressing cells to identify the hallmark pathways most affected by the presence of OspC family members. In both comparisons, IFN response pathways were among the top five pathways enriched in control samples (GFP) (Figure S1B), indicating global suppression of IFN response pathways by OspC. Finally, we tested whether ISG expression was blocked at the protein level by quantifying cell surface expression of the ISG Tetherin by flow cytometry. After gating on live transfected cells (Figure S1C), we found that Tetherin expression was blocked in cells expressing OspC1 and OspC3 (Figure 1G). Next, we sought to determine if OspC family members translocated at endogenous levels by Shigella during infection impact IFN signaling. HeLa cells infected with WT Shigella or strains lacking either ospC1, ospC3, or both (ΔospC1/C3) were treated with IFNβ, and ISG expression was assessed. As previously observed, infection with WT bacteria inhibited expression of Viperin and IFIT1 (Figure 1H). Infection with ΔospC1, ΔospC3, or ΔospC1/C3 resulted in higher levels of IFNβ-mediated ISG expression than infection with WT bacteria (Figure 1H). Analysis of protein levels by western blot demonstrated that IFIT1 expression was also significantly diminished when cells infected with WT Shigella, but not strains lacking ospC1 and/or ospC3, were exposed to IFNβ (Figure 1I and quantification Figure S1D). These data indicate that OspC1 and OspC3 contribute to the inhibition of IFN signaling in epithelial cells infected with Shigella. However, when compared with ΔmxiD-infected cells, the rescue we observed in ΔospC1/C3-infected cells was only partial, likely suggesting a contribution from other effectors identified in our screen (Figure 1D). OspC1 and OspC3 have previously been reported to inhibit cell death pathways. OspC1 targets an unknown host factor to inhibit Caspase 3/7-mediated apoptosis (Ashida et al., 2020Ashida H. Sasakawa C.

We next investigated whether inhibition of IFN signaling by OspC1 and OspC3 was related to their cell death inhibition. Expression of OspC effectors in 293T cells in the absence or presence of IFNβ had no effect on host cell viability, as assessed by quantifying released lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Figure S2A), intracellular ATP—a marker of active metabolism (Figure S2B) or by using flow cytometry to determine the percentages of live versus dead cells (Figures S2C and S1C). In addition, inhibition of pyroptosis and apoptosis with Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketon (Z-VAD-FMK) or necroptosis with necrosulfonamide had no effect on ISRE activation (Figures S2D and S2E). Finally, the inhibitory activities of OspC1 and OspC3 were identical in the presence of a DMSO vehicle control or cell death inhibitors (Figures S2D and S2F). These data demonstrate that expression of OspC1 or OspC3 in combination with IFN treatment is not cytotoxic. In addition, we show that pharmacological inhibition of pyroptosis, apoptosis, or necroptosis neither phenocopy OspC1 or OspC3 expression in blocking IFN signaling nor affect their ability to block IFN signaling. Our prediction of the OspC3 tertiary structure using AlphaFold (Jumper et al., 2021Jumper J. Evans R. Pritzel A. Green T. Figurnov M. Ronneberger O. Tunyasuvunakool K. Bates R. Žídek A.

Chemical pesticides are one of the most important strategies for managing FAW on a short-term basis. The seven synthetic insecticides including novel and conventional belong to four chemical group, spinetoram and spinosad (spinosyns), lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin and bifenthrin (pyrethroids), abamectin (avermectins), broflinilide (diamides), were assessed for their efficiency in causing mortality to second instar S. frugiperda larvae at 24, 48 and 72 h post-treatment at five different serial concentrations (10 to 0.625 mg liter-1). The second instar S. frugiperda larvae were susceptible to the tested synthetic insecticides, however, the toxicity index of synthetic insecticides was estimated based on lethal concentration 50 (LC50), while, LC50 was calculated from the data of larval mortality. The broflanilide and abamectin proved to be the most toxic having the highest toxicity index of 100 and 78.29%, respectively, followed by cypermethrin and bifenthrin were showed toxicity index of 75.47 and 66.89%, respectively. The LC50 values were 0.606 and 0.774 mg liter-1 for broflanilide and abamectin, respectively, followed by cypermethrin and bifenthrin were showed LC50 values of 0.803 and 0.906 mg liter-1 at 72 h post-treatment. Rest of the other synthetic insecticides were showed moderate toxicity index of 42.11 to 62.09%, based on LC50 values were 1.439 to 0.976 mg liter-1 at 72 h post-treatment. The efficiency of synthetic insecticides was increased by increasing concentration level and exposure time. The screened synthetic insecticides among seven insecticides perhaps, provide basis for the development of novel insecticides for controlling S. frugiperda population after further research to evaluate and validate the laboratory results in the field."
https://openalex.org/W4280514957,"3C-like protease (3CLpro) processes and liberates functional viral proteins essential for the maturation and infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. It has been suggested that 3CLpro is catalytically active as a dimer, making the dimerization interface a target for antiviral development. Guided by structural analysis, here we introduced single amino acid substitutions at nine residues at three key sites of the dimer interface to assess their impact on dimerization and activity. We show that at site 1, alanine substitution of S1 or E166 increased by twofold or reduced relative activity, respectively. At site 2, alanine substitution of S10 or E14 eliminated activity, whereas K12A exhibited ∼60% relative activity. At site 3, alanine substitution of R4, E290, or Q299 eliminated activity, whereas S139A exhibited 46% relative activity. We further found that the oligomerization states of the dimer interface mutants varied; the inactive mutants R4A, R4Q, S10A/C, E14A/D/Q/S, E290A, and Q299A/E were present as dimers, demonstrating that dimerization is not an indication of catalytically active 3CLpro. In addition, present mostly as monomers, K12A displayed residual activity, which could be attributed to the conspicuous amount of dimer present. Finally, differential scanning calorimetry did not reveal a direct relationship between the thermodynamic stability of mutants with oligomerization or catalytic activity. These results provide insights on two allosteric sites, R4/E290 and S10/E14, that may promote the design of antiviral compounds that target the dimer interface rather than the active site of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3CLpro."
https://openalex.org/W4280624142,"Background Inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in healthcare facilities (HCFs) have an impact on the transmission of infectious diseases, including COVID-19 pandemic. But, there is limited data on the status of WASH facilities in the healthcare settings of Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess WASH facilities and related challenges in the HCFs of Northeastern Ethiopia during the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from July to August 2020. About 70 HCFs were selected using a simple random sampling technique. We used a mixed approach of qualitative and quantitative study. The quantitative data were collected by an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire and observational checklist, whereas the qualitative data were collected using a key-informant interview from the head of HCFs, janitors, and WASH coordinator of the HCFs. The quantitative data were entered in EpiData version 4.6 and exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 for data cleaning and analysis. The quantitative data on access to WASH facilities was reported using WHO ladder guidelines, which include no access, limited access, and basic access, whereas the qualitative data on challenges to WASH facilities were triangulated with the quantitative result. Results From the survey of 70 HCFs, three-fourths 53 (75.7%) were clinics, 12 (17.2%) were health centers, and 5 (7.1%) were hospitals. Most (88.6%) of the HCFs had basic access to water supply. The absence of a specific budget for WASH facilities, non-functional water pipes, the absence of water-quality monitoring systems, and frequent water interruptions were the major problems with water supply, which occurred primarily in clinics and health centers. Due to the absence of separate latrine designated for disabled people, none of the HCFs possessed basic sanitary facilities. Half (51.5%) of the HCFs had limited access to sanitation facilities. The major problems were the absence of separate latrines for healthcare workers and clients, as well as female and male staffs, an unbalanced number of functional latrines for the number of clients, non-functional latrines, poor cleanliness and misuse of the latrine. Less than a quarter of the HCFs 15 (21.4%) had basic access to handwashing facilities, while half 35 (50%) of the HCFs did not. The lack of functional handwashing facilities at expected sites and misuse of the facilities around the latrine, including theft of supplies by visitors, were the two most serious problems with hygiene facilities. Conclusion Despite the fact that the majority of HCFs had basic access to water, there were problems in their sanitation and handwashing facilities. The lack of physical infrastructure, poor quality of facilities, lack of separate budget to maintain WASH facilities, and inappropriate utilization of WASH facilities were the main problems in HCFs. Further investigation should be done to assess the enabling factors and constraints for the provision, use, and maintenance of WASH infrastructure at HCFs."
https://openalex.org/W4200633346,"Unlike spiking neurons which compress continuous inputs into digital signals for transmitting information via action potentials, non-spiking neurons modulate analog signals through graded potential responses. Such neurons have been found in a large variety of nervous tissues in both vertebrate and invertebrate species, and have been proven to play a central role in neuronal information processing. If general and vast efforts have been made for many years to model spiking neurons using conductance-based models (CBMs), very few methods have been developed for non-spiking neurons. When a CBM is built to characterize the neuron behavior, it should be endowed with generalization capabilities (i.e. the ability to predict acceptable neuronal responses to different novel stimuli not used during the model's building). Yet, since CBMs contain a large number of parameters, they may typically suffer from a lack of such a capability. In this paper, we propose a new systematic approach based on multi-objective optimization which builds general non-spiking models with generalization capabilities. The proposed approach only requires macroscopic experimental data from which all the model parameters are simultaneously determined without compromise. Such an approach is applied on three non-spiking neurons of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a well-known model organism in neuroscience that predominantly transmits information through non-spiking signals. These three neurons, arbitrarily labeled by convention as RIM, AIY and AFD, represent, to date, the three possible forms of non-spiking neuronal responses of C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W4280504975,"Across biological scales, gene-regulatory networks employ autorepression (negative feedback) to maintain homeostasis and minimize failure from aberrant expression. Here, we present a proof of concept that disrupting transcriptional negative feedback dysregulates viral gene expression to therapeutically inhibit replication and confers a high evolutionary barrier to resistance. We find that nucleic-acid decoys mimicking cis-regulatory sites act as ""feedback disruptors,"" break homeostasis, and increase viral transcription factors to cytotoxic levels (termed ""open-loop lethality""). Feedback disruptors against herpesviruses reduced viral replication >2-logs without activating innate immunity, showed sub-nM IC50, synergized with standard-of-care antivirals, and inhibited virus replication in mice. In contrast to approved antivirals where resistance rapidly emerged, no feedback-disruptor escape mutants evolved in long-term cultures. For SARS-CoV-2, disruption of a putative feedback circuit also generated open-loop lethality, reducing viral titers by >1-log. These results demonstrate that generating open-loop lethality, via negative-feedback disruption, may yield a class of antimicrobials with a high genetic barrier to resistance."

https://openalex.org/W4280584774,"Heat perception enables acute avoidance responses to prevent tissue damage and maintain body thermal homeostasis. Unlike other modalities, how heat signals are processed in the spinal cord remains unclear. By single-cell gene profiling, we identified ErbB4, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, as a novel marker of heat-sensitive spinal neurons in mice. Ablating spinal ErbB4+ neurons attenuates heat sensation. These neurons receive monosynaptic inputs from TRPV1+ nociceptors and form excitatory synapses onto target neurons. Activation of ErbB4+ neurons enhances the heat response, while inhibition reduces the heat response. We showed that heat sensation is regulated by NRG1, an activator of ErbB4, and it involves dynamic activity of the tyrosine kinase that promotes glutamatergic transmission. Evidence indicates that the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling is also engaged in hypersensitivity of pathological pain. Together, these results identify a spinal neuron connection consisting of ErbB4+ neurons for heat sensation and reveal a regulatory mechanism by the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling."

Their most dangerous consequence is progression to melanoma. This risk often triggers preemptive extensive surgical excisions in childhood, producing severe lifelong challenges. We have presented preclinical models, including multiple genetically engineered mice and xenografted human lesions, which enabled testing locally applied pharmacologic agents to avoid surgery. The murine models permitted the identification of proliferative versus senescent nevus phases and treatments targeting both. These nevi recapitulated the histologic and molecular features of human giant congenital nevi, including the risk of melanoma transformation. Cutaneously delivered MEK, PI3K, and c-KIT inhibitors or proinflammatory squaric acid dibutylester (SADBE) achieved major regressions. SADBE triggered innate immunity that ablated detectable nevocytes, fully prevented melanoma, and regressed human giant nevus xenografts. These findings reveal nevus mechanistic vulnerabilities and suggest opportunities for topical interventions that may alter the therapeutic options for children with congenital giant nevi."

Thirty-nine of the samples were excluded from further analysis as no additional data were available for them. Of the rest of the samples, the majority- 48% (95% CI 38-59%) had a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, 14% (95% CI 8-23%)-a subsequent history of positivity and 37% (95% CI 28-48%) were considered as false positive.A substantial proportion of the inconclusive results should be considered as positive samples at the beginning or the end of the infection. However, the number of false-positive results is also significant and each patient's result should be analyzed separately following the clinical symptoms and epidemiological data."
https://openalex.org/W4280503019,"In the past few years, light, affordable wearable inertial measurement units have been providing to clinicians and researchers the possibility to quantitatively study motor degeneracy by comparing gait trials from patients and/or healthy subjects. To do so, standard gait features can be used but they fail to detect subtle changes in several pathologies including multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system whose symptoms include lower limb impairment, which is why gait trials are commonly used by clinicians for their patients' follow-up. This article describes a method to compare pairs of gait signals, visualize the results and interpret them, based on topological data analysis techniques. Our method is non-parametric and requires no data other than gait signals acquired with inertial measurement units. We introduce tools from topological data analysis (sublevel sets, persistence barcodes) in a practical way to make it as accessible as possible in order to encourage its use by clinicians. We apply our method to study a cohort of patients suffering from progressive multiple sclerosis and healthy subjects. We show that it can help estimate the severity of the disease and also be used for longitudinal follow-up to detect an evolution of the disease or other phenomena such as asymmetry or outliers."

Cross-sectional data from the 72-month follow-up was analysed. Data on NO2 concentration in the study area was collected at 80 locations in 2019, and land use regression modelling was used to estimate annual NO2 concentration at children's homes. Associations between predicted NO2 exposure and children's cognitive development as well as children's behavioural problems were estimated using linear regression models adjusted for an extensive set of confounders. All results were expressed per 10 μg/m3 increase in NO2.1143 children were included in the analysis. We found no association between NO2 and children's cognitive development (beta -0.05, 95% CI [-0.20; 0.10]) or behavioural problems (beta 0.02, 95% CI [-0.80; 0.12]).No association between child cognition or child behaviour and NO2 was found in this cross-sectional analysis.

https://openalex.org/W4280550286,"Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) (ASC) is a 22 kDa protein that functions as the central adaptor for inflammasome assembly. ASC forms insoluble specks in monocytes undergoing pyroptosis, and the polymerization of ASC provides a template of CARDs that leads to proximity-mediated autoactivation of caspase-1 in canonical inflammasomes. However, specks are insoluble protein complexes, and solubility is typically important for protein function. Therefore, we sought to define whether ASC specks comprise active inflammasome complexes or are simply the end stage of exhausted ASC polymers. Using a THP-1 cell-lysing model of caspase-1 activation that is ASC dependent, we compared caspase-1 activation induced by preassembled insoluble ASC specks and soluble monomeric forms of ASC. Unexpectedly, after controlling for the concentration dependence of ASC oligomerization, we found that only insoluble forms of ASC promoted caspase-1 autocatalysis. This link to insolubility was recapitulated with recombinant ASC. We show that purified recombinant ASC spontaneously precipitated and was functional, whereas the maltose-binding protein-ASC fusion to ASC (promoting enhanced solubility) was inactive until induced to insolubility by binding to amylose beads. This functional link to insolubility also held true for the Y146A mutation of the CARD of ASC, which avoids insolubility and caspase-1 activation. Thus, we conclude that the role of ASC insolubility in inflammasome function is inextricably linked to its pyrin domain-mediated and CARD-mediated polymerizations. These findings will support future studies into the molecular mechanisms controlling ASC solubility."

Here, we hypothesized that the codes mediating neuronal communication in the HPC and LPFC microcircuits have distinctively evolved to serve plasticity and memory function at different spatiotemporal scales. We used a virtual reality task in which animals selected one of the two targets in the arms of the maze, according to a learned context-color rule. Our results show that during associative learning, HPC principal cells concentrate spikes in bursts, enabling temporal summation and fast synaptic plasticity in small populations of neurons and ultimately facilitating rapid encoding of associative memories. On the other hand, layer II/III LPFC pyramidal cells fire spikes more sparsely distributed over time. The latter would facilitate broadcasting of signals loaded in short-term memory across neuronal populations without necessarily triggering fast synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W4280499507,"Ebola virus (EBOV) infections continue to pose a global public health threat, with high mortality rates and sporadic outbreaks in Central and Western Africa. A quantitative understanding of the key processes driving EBOV assembly and budding could provide valuable insights to inform drug development. Here, we use a computational model to evaluate EBOV matrix assembly. Our model focuses on the assembly kinetics of VP40, the matrix protein in EBOV, and its interaction with phosphatidylserine (PS) in the host cell membrane. It has been shown that mammalian cells transfected with VP40-expressing plasmids are capable of producing virus-like particles (VLPs) that closely resemble EBOV virions. Previous studies have also shown that PS levels in the host cell membrane affects VP40 association with the plasma membrane inner leaflet and that lower membrane PS levels result in lower VLP production. Our computational findings indicate that PS may also have a direct influence on VP40 VLP assembly and budding, where a higher PS level will result in a higher VLP budding rate and filament dissociation rate. Our results further suggest that the assembly of VP40 filaments follow the nucleation-elongation theory, where initialization and oligomerization of VP40 are two distinct steps in the assembly process. Our findings advance the current understanding of VP40 VLP formation by identifying new possible mechanisms of PS influence on VP40 assembly. We propose that these mechanisms could inform treatment strategies targeting PS alone or in combination with other VP40 assembly steps."

In the first phase of the research (Study I), 645 respondents were assessed using the NEO-FFI Scale, the Self-Esteem Scale and a back-translated version of the Self-Compassion Scale. The aim of Study I is to analyse the factor structure of the Polish adaptation of the Self-Compassion Scale. The results of analyses using structural equation modelling and exploratory structural equation modelling confirm the six-component structure of the Self-Compassion Scale and the possibility of distinguishing a single primary factor. The results of these analyses indicate that self-compassion is conceptually distinctive from personality traits and self-judgement. In the second phase of the study (Study II), 688 respondents were assessed and the findings show that self-compassion is a predictor of depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, and satisfaction with life, and is also linked to emotional intelligence. In conclusion, the findings of this study show that the Polish version of the Self-Compassion Scale is a reliable and valid measure of self-compassion."

Potential insight into this resistance stems from prior work that showed EGFR in normal epithelial cells docks to the extracellular domain of the plasma membrane proteoglycan syndecan-4 (Sdc4) engaged with α3β1 and α6β4 integrins. We now report that this receptor complex is modified by the recruitment of syndecan-2 (Sdc2), the Recepteur d’Origine Nantais (RON) tyrosine kinase, and the cellular signaling mediator Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL1) in triple-negative breast carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where it contributes to EGFR kinase–independent proliferation. Treatment with a peptide mimetic of the EGFR docking site in the extracellular domain of Sdc4 (called SSTNEGFR) disrupts the entire complex and causes a rapid, global arrest of the cell cycle. Normal epithelial cells do not recruit these additional receptors to the adhesion mechanism and are not arrested by SSTNEGFR. Although EGFR docking with Sdc4 in the tumor cells is required, cell cycle progression does not depend on EGFR kinase. Instead, progression depends on RON kinase, activated by its incorporation into the complex. RON activates ABL1, which suppresses p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and prevents a p38-mediated signal that would otherwise arrest the cell cycle.

Whereas the α6β4 integrin engages the Sdc4 cytoplasmic domain, coupling of EGFR and the α3β1 integrin relies on a juxtamembrane site in the Sdc4 ectodomain (amino acids 87–131 in humans), which is blocked by a peptide mimetic now called “synstatin-EGFR” (SSTNEGFR) (13Wang H.

EGFR is also a causal agent in triple-negative breast carcinoma (TNBC), a highly malignant form that comprises 15% to 25% of breast cancers (25Carvalho F.M. Bacchi L.M. Santos P.P. Bacchi C.E.

Nonetheless, EGFR inhibitors, including the EGFR-blocking antibody cetuximab or EGFR kinase inhibitors, have had disappointing outcomes in the clinic (17Cassell A. Grandis J.R. Investigational EGFR-targeted therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2010; 19: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Harari P.M. Wheeler D.L. Grandis J.R. Molecular target approaches in head and neck cancer: epidermal growth factor receptor and beyond.Semin. Radiat. Oncol. 2009; 19: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting alternative mechanisms through which EGFR promotes or sustains the progression of these cancers. Accordingly, we subjected head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and TNBC cells for treatment with SSTNEGFR to probe the involvement of Sdc4 as a partner in EGFR signaling in these cancers. We find that SSTNEGFR induces a rapid and global cell cycle arrest in HNSCC and TNBC cells, including an S-phase arrest; this is unusual because, although growth factor receptors may be required to enter S-phase, their signaling is not thought to be required once S-phase is begun. We also find that nontransformed oral or mammary epithelial cells are refractory to proliferation arrest by SSTNEGFR, making its inhibition highly specific for tumor cells. Furthermore, although EGFR is required in this regulatory mechanism, its kinase activity is not. Instead, cell cycle progression depends upon active recepteur d’origine nantais (RON) (also known as macrophage stimulating protein-1 receptor (MST1R) (28Ronsin C. Muscatelli F. Mattei M.G. Breathnach R. A novel putative receptor protein tyrosine kinase of the met family.Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1195-1202PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yao H.P. Zhou Y.Q. Zhang R. Wang M.H.

Met-related receptor tyrosine kinase Ron in tumor growth and metastasis.Adv. Cancer Res. 2008; 100: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)) and the cytoplasmic kinase ABL1 (31Greuber E.K. Smith-Pearson P. Wang J. Pendergast A.M. Role of ABL family kinases in cancer: from leukaemia to solid tumours.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), which, along with the Sdc4 homolog syndecan-2 (Sdc2) partners with Sdc4, EGFR, and the laminin-binding integrins specifically in the tumor cells. When these kinases are inactivated by their displacement from Sdc4 by SSTNEGFR, a corresponding increase in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) occurs, presumably constitutively activated by metabolic, oncogenic, and/or genotoxic stress in the tumor cells but held in abeyance by signaling from the Sdc4 receptor complex. This suggests that an epithelial cell migration mechanism that relies on Sdc4, EGFR, and the α3β1 and α6β4 integrins adopts a dual role by incorporating Sdc2, RON, and ABL1 to sustain S-phase progression at times of cellular stress. The proliferation of a panel of human TNBC and HNSCC cell lines in the presence of SSTNEGFR was compared to nontumorigenic breast, oral, and epidermal epithelial cells. Whereas the proliferation of nontumorigenic, immortalized normal oral keratinocytes (NOKs), human tonsillar epithelial cells (HTEs), mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A), and epidermal keratinocytes (HaCaT) are not affected by SSTNEGFR (Fig. 1A), the peptide causes reduced proliferation of HNSCC (Fig. 1B) and TNBC cells (Fig. 1C) with an IC50 that falls with the range of 3 to 10 μM. This coincides with the approximate concentration required to displace 90% of EGFR and the α3β1 integrin from Sdc4 (13Wang H. Jin H. Beauvais D.M. Rapraeger A.C. Cytoplasmic domain interactions of syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 with alpha6beta4 integrin mediate human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER1 and HER2)-dependent motility and survival.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 30318-30332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For the sake of simplicity, we elected to use a single cell line (UWSCC47 cells) to conduct exploratory studies into this growth mechanism and then extended our findings to the other transformed cells. UM-SCC47 cells and normal NOKs as a control were treated with SSTNEGFR, accompanied by labeling with the thymidine nucleoside analog 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU), to analyze DNA synthesis by flow cytometry. As expected, treated NOKs showed no significant change in EdU incorporation or in the distribution of cells throughout the cell cycle when compared to untreated cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, an S-phase block after only 3 h treatment of UM-SCC47 cells is indicated by a complete lack of EdU incorporation (Fig. 2A), and the failure of the cells to show any major change in their distribution in the G1-, S-, G2-, and M-phases of the cell cycle suggests the peptide may induce a global block to cell cycle progression. Shorter treatment times utilizing in situ staining of fixed cells show that treatment with SSTNEGFR for as little as 1 h reduces EdU incorporation by well over 90% in HNSCC and TNBC cells, whereas NOKs and MCF10A cells show no reduction (Fig. 2B). To verify the arrest in S-phase, UM-SCC47 cells were synchronized in early S-phase using a double thymidine block, then released for 2 h to recover (Fig. 2C). Cells released for 2 h and chased for an additional 12 h with the vehicle alone progress into late S-phase/G2 or pass through G2/M and reenter G1 (Fig. 2C). In contrast, cells released for 2 h then chased for 12 h in SSTNEGFR remain entirely in S-phase and show little or no EdU incorporation above background (Fig. 2C). An S-phase arrest in response to EGFR inhibition is uncommon, as receptor signaling is typically required to bypass the G1/S “start” point of the cell cycle but is thought to no longer be required once DNA synthesis has begun (32Pardee A.B. G1 events and regulation of cell proliferation.Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar). Mechanisms that do cause S-phase arrest typically arise from the DNA damage response (DDR), activated either by DNA damage or replicative stress (33Flynn R.L. Zou L. ATR: a master conductor of cellular responses to DNA replication stress.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 133-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 34Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Cell-cycle checkpoints and cancer.Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar). The DDR activates p53 and/or checkpoint kinases (e.g., Chk1 or Chk2) downstream of the DNA damage sensors (e.g., ATM, ATR, and DNA-dependent protein kinase) that phosphorylate cell cycle regulatory factors, among them the histone variant H2AX (33Flynn R.L. Zou L. ATR: a master conductor of cellular responses to DNA replication stress.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 133-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 34Kastan M.B.

Solier S. et al.GammaH2AX and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). However, UM-SCC47 or MDA-MB-231 tumor cells arrested in response to SSTNEGFR fail to activate either Chk1 or Chk2 or cause phosphorylation of H2AX (γH2AX) (Fig. S1). This contrasts with the phosphorylation observed when they are treated with ionizing radiation or hydroxyurea (HU) to induce DNA damage or replicative stress that leads to DDR activation (35Bonner W.M. Redon C.E. Dickey J.S. Nakamura A.J. Sedelnikova O.A. Solier S. et al.GammaH2AX and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1). The apparent failure of the SSTNEGFR-arrested cells to accumulate in any one phase of the cell cycle suggests that the block is global rather than focused on any one phase. To test this, we compared the behavior of UM-SCC47 cells subjected to either a double thymidine block or a double SSTNEGFR block. The UM-SCC47 cells have a 24 h cell cycle, with an approximate 8 h S-phase, 2 h G2/M, and 14 h G1. Thus, EdU labels approximately one-third of the cells if they are not synchronized (Fig. 2D). A 24 h thymidine block arrests the one-third of the cells that are spread throughout S-phase, whereas the rest progress to the G1/S start before arresting. A subsequent 16 h release allows these and the cells arrested throughout S-phase to progress through and exit S-phase and enter G1. Reimposition of a second 24 h thymidine block at this point prevents these cells from entering S-phase and they arrest as a cohort at the G1/S interface. Cells labeled at this point show no EdU incorporation (0 h), but cells released for 4 or 6 h transit partially through S-phase, as shown by extensive (greater than 80%) EdU labeling (Fig. 2D). This contrasts with the result seen if the cells are subjected to a 24 h double SSTNEGFR block (Fig. 2D). The cells show no labeling for 1 h after SSTNEGFR removal, but at 2, 4, or 6 h after release, approximately one-third of the cells incorporate EdU, the same as cells treated with vehicle alone, indicating that the number of cells in S-phase at any of these time points remains the same (Fig. 2D). There is no increase in cells entering S-phase, suggesting that cells have not piled up at the G1/S-phase boundary despite the ability of SSTNEGFR to arrest cells in S-phase (Fig. 2C) nor have cells entering S-phase been delayed by a block elsewhere. Instead, the cells appear to globally arrest wherever they are in the cell cycle when SSTNEGFR is applied and then recover and resume their transit when SSTNEGFR is removed. We have shown previously that EGFR-stimulated migration of HaCaT and MCF10A epithelial cells on LN332 depends on its coupling with the α3β1 and α6β4 integrins by Sdc4 and requires EGF and active EGFR kinase (7Wang H. Jin H. Rapraeger A.C.

Similarly, EGF-stimulated migration of NOKs or UM-SCC47 cells through LN332-coated filters is blocked by EGFR kinase inhibitors (gefitinib or erlotinib), SSTNEGFR, or α3β1 integrin blocking antibody (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the proliferation of NOKs or UM-SCC47 cells is independent of EGFR kinase activity, shown by the failure of gefitinib and erlotinib to block EdU incorporation even when used at 100-fold over their IC50 (Fig. 3B). But, consistent with the proliferation inhibition observed in Figure 1, the UM-SCC47 failed to incorporate EdU in the presence of SSTNEGFR and the addition of EGF cannot reverse the block to EdU incorporation by SSTNEGFR in the UM-SCC47 tumor cells (Fig. 3B). These findings prompted us to question the potential role of other kinases in the arrest mechanism. Like EGFR (7Wang H. Jin H. Rapraeger A.C.

This paper introduces the domain-matching heuristic to explain how humans perform causal reasoning when lacking mechanistic knowledge. We posit that people reduce the otherwise vast space of possible causal relations by focusing only on the likeliest ones. When thinking about a cause, people tend to think about possible effects that participate in the same domain, and vice versa. To explore the specific domains that people use, we asked people to cluster artifacts. The analyses revealed three commonly employed mechanism domains: the mechanical, chemical, and electromagnetic. Using these domains, we tested the domain-matching heuristic by testing adults’ and children’s causal attribution, prediction, judgment, and subjective understanding. We found that people’s responses conform with domain-matching. These results provide evidence for a heuristic that explains how people engage in causal reasoning without directly appealing to mechanistic or probabilistic knowledge."

Surprisingly, we found that additional mutations in IL3 immediately adjacent to TM5 (e.g., D2465N) almost completely abolish IP3R1 Ca2+ channel activity, indicating that the integrity of this region is critical to IP3R1 function.

IP3R activation is initiated by the secondary messenger IP3, which can be generated via activation of cell surface receptors, such as G-protein–coupled receptors or receptor tyrosine kinases (1Prole D.L. Taylor C.W. Structure and function of IP3 receptors.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2019; 11a035063Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In response to activation, IP3Rs undergo a conformational change and release Ca2+ from ER stores into the cytosol (1Prole D.L. Taylor C.W. Structure and function of IP3 receptors.Cold Spring Harb.

IP3R-mediated calcium signaling is critical to a plethora of cellular processes, such as fertilization, secretion, and smooth muscle contraction (4Mikoshiba K.

The mammalian genome encodes three IP3R types (IP3R1, IP3R2, and IP3R3), which have different tissue distributions and can form homotetramers or heterotetramers, with IP3R1 being the most widely expressed and best characterized of the three types (1Prole D.L. Taylor C.W. Structure and function of IP3 receptors.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2019; 11a035063Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). IP3R1, like IP3R2 and IP3R3, is ∼2700 amino acids in length and contains six transmembrane (TM) domains near the C terminus (1Prole D.L. Taylor C.W. Structure and function of IP3 receptors.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2019; 11a035063Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The channel pore is created by an assemblage of TM domains 5 and 6 and the intervening intralumenal loop 3 (IL3) (2Fan G. Baker M.R. Wang Z. Seryshev A.B. Ludtke S.J.

It appears that the conformational change in IP3Rs that occurs upon Ca2+ channel activation (2Fan G. Baker M.R. Wang Z. Seryshev A.B. Ludtke S.J.

The making and breaking of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor tetramers.Messenger (Los Angeles). 2018; 6: 45-49PubMed Google Scholar). This reduces cellular IP3R levels as well as the sensitivity of ER Ca2+ stores to IP3 (12Wright F.A. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Chapter 4 - inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor ubiquitination.Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2016; 141: 141-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, the ERAD pathway appears to be responsible for basal IP3R turnover under resting conditions (13Wright F.A. Lu J.P. Sliter D.A. Dupré N. Rouleau G.A. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H.

We have shown previously that the erlin1/2 complex, an ∼2 MDa ER membrane complex composed of ∼40 erlin1 and erlin2 molecules, binds strongly and rapidly to activated IP3Rs (15Pearce M.M.P.

The making and breaking of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor tetramers.Messenger (Los Angeles). 2018; 6: 45-49PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the erlin1/2 complex inhibits RNF170 association with activated IP3Rs and ablates IP3R ubiquitination and IP3R ERAD (14Wright F.A. Bonzerato C.G. Sliter D.A. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H.

Chem. 2018; 293: 15706-15714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of how the erlin1/2 complex recognizes activated IP3Rs remains to be resolved. We hypothesized previously (15Pearce M.M.P. Wormer D.B. Wilkens S. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. An endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane complex composed of SPFH1 and SPFH2 mediates the ER-associated degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 10433-10445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that the erlin1/2 complex interacts with IP3R IL3, the largest of the three intralumenal loops, because the vast majority (>90%) of the erlin1 and erlin2 polypeptides are located within the ER lumen (15Pearce M.M.P. Wormer D.B. Wilkens S. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. An endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane complex composed of SPFH1 and SPFH2 mediates the ER-associated degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 10433-10445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and IL3 undergoes a conformational change upon channel opening (2Fan G. Baker M.R. Wang Z. Seryshev A.B. Ludtke S.J. Baker M.L. et al.Cryo-EM reveals ligand induced allostery underlying InsP3R channel gating.Cell Res. 2018; 28: 1158-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here, we have tested this idea by subjecting IL3 to mutagenesis and find that a small region of IL3 close to TM5 (amino acids 2471–2472) is critical for the erlin1/2 complex to recognize activated IP3R1 and for IP3R1 to undergo ERAD. Surprisingly, we also discovered that mutations immediately adjacent to TM5 (e.g., of D-2465) block Ca2+ channel activity, showing that this region is critical for IP3R function. To better define the sequence of events that lead to IP3R1 ERAD, we examined the effects of TAK-243, a first-in-class inhibitor of UBE1, the mammalian E1 enzyme that charges the vast majority of E2 ubiquitin-conjugation enzymes with ubiquitin (17Hyer M.L. Milhollen M.A. Ciavarri J. Fleming P. Traore T. Sappal D. et al.A small-molecule inhibitor of the ubiquitin activating enzyme for cancer treatment.Nat. Med. 2018; 24: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We utilized αT3 mouse pituitary cells, since these cells represent an excellent model system to study IP3R1 ERAD in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which robustly stimulates IP3-dependent signaling and initiates IP3R processing (15Pearce M.M.P.

E2 enzymes receive activated ubiquitin from UBE1 and form E2-ubiquitin intermediates via DTT-sensitive thiolester bonds (19Liu W. Tang X. Qi X. Fu X. Ghimire S.

Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E2-ubiquitin intermediates were detected in αT3 cell lysates prepared without DTT but were dramatically diminished by pretreatment of cells with TAK-243 for 10 min (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2), and as expected, only unmodified E2 enzymes were seen in presence of DTT (lane 3 and 4). The abundance of high molecular weight ubiquitinated species in cell lysates was also greatly diminished by TAK-243 (lanes 1 and 2, top panel) but was not markedly altered by DTT (lane 3), since the isopeptide bonds via which polyubiquitinated species are formed are not DTT sensitive (20Xu Q. Farah M. Webster J.M. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Bortezomib rapidly suppresses ubiquitin thiolesterification to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and inhibits ubiquitination of histones and type I inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, these data show that brief TAK-243 pretreatment is sufficient to greatly inhibit the loading of multiple E2 enzymes with ubiquitin as well as the formation of ubiquitin conjugates in αT3 cells, indicating that UBE1 is efficiently inhibited. This pretreatment also completely blocked GnRH-induced IP3R1 polyubiquitination, without substantially altering association of the erlin1/2 complex and RNF170 with activated IP3R1 (Fig. 1B), indicating that erlin1/2 complex and RNF170 association occurs prior to and independently of IP3R1 polyubiquitination. Further, TAK-243 completely blocked GnRH-induced IP3R1 downregulation (Fig. 1C), indicating that it is ubiquitination rather than erlin1/2 complex and RNF170 association that directly mediates IP3R1 degradation. Overall, these data confirm our previous assumptions (9Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. The making and breaking of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor tetramers.Messenger (Los Angeles). 2018; 6: 45-49PubMed Google Scholar) about the sequence of events that lead to the ERAD of activated IP3Rs: first, the erlin1/2 complex associates, followed by IP3R ubiquitination, which in turn triggers IP3R degradation by the proteasome. Since we intended to use IP3R1 KO αT3 cell lines (21Schulman J.J. Wright F.A. Han X. Zluhan E.J. Szczesniak L.M. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. The stability and expression level of Bok are governed by binding to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 11820-11828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) reconstituted with exogenous IP3R1 constructs to define the molecular determinants of the erlin1/2 complex–IP3R1 interaction, we first sought to validate this approach. WT IP3R1-hemagglutinin (HA) (IP3R1HAWT) was introduced into IP3R1KO αT3 cells and was shown by immunoprecipitation (IP) to bind to endogenous erlin1, erlin2, and RNF170, and also be polyubiquitinated following GnRH treatment (Fig. 2A) with kinetics (peaks at 2–5 min, Fig. 2B) very similar to that seen for endogenous IP3R1 (15Pearce M.M.P. Wormer D.B. Wilkens S. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. An endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane complex composed of SPFH1 and SPFH2 mediates the ER-associated degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors.J. Biol.

Chem. 2011; 286: 24426-24433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). GnRH-induced IP3R1HAWT ubiquitination was also blocked by TAK-243 pretreatment without altering erlin1, erlin2, and RNF170 association (Fig. 2C), indicating that exogenous IP3R1HAWT is processed by the UPP essentially identically to endogenous IP3R1. Likewise, inhibition of endogenous IP3R1 ERAD by acute pretreatment with the SERCA pump inhibitor, thapsigargin, which discharges ER Ca2+ stores (22Alzayady K.J. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. The role of Ca2+ in triggering inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor ubiquitination.Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D, lanes 1–4), was also seen for IP3R1HAWT expressed in IP3R1KO αT3 cells (lanes 5–8). To test the role of IL3, initially large deletions to this region were made (Fig. 3A). IP3R1KO αT3 cells reconstituted with IP3R1HA mutants were stimulated with GnRH for 5 min, and erlin1/2 complex association was assessed via co-IP (Fig. 3B). The constructs with largest deletions, IP3R1HAΔ2463-2551 and IP3R1HAΔ2463-2519, both failed to associate with erlin1/2 complex after stimulation with GnRH (Fig. 3B, lanes 3–6), indicating that IL3 is indeed crucial for erlin1/2 complex binding. Interestingly, for constructs with smaller deletions, IP3R1HAΔ2481-2519 bound to the erlin1/2 complex, while IP3R1HAΔ2463-2480 did not (Fig. 3B, lanes 7–10), suggesting that the erlin1/2 complex–binding region is close to TM5. Likewise, IP3R1HAΔ2473-2480 bound to the erlin1/2 complex, while IP3R1HAΔ2463-2472 did not (Fig. 3B, lanes 11–14). Since some substantial deletions to IL3 (e.g., IP3R1HAΔ2473-2480 and IP3R1HAΔ2481-2519) do not impair erlin1/2 complex association, simply shortening length of IL3 does not explain the inability of IP3R1HAΔ2463-2472 to bind. Rather, these results (summarized in Fig. 3A, right) narrow down the putative erlin1/2 complex–binding site to the 10 amino acid (aa) region next to TM5. Additionally, RNF170 association and polyubiquitination paralleled erlin1/2 complex association for each IP3R1HA mutant, indicating that erlin1/2 complex association governs the subsequent processing of IP3R1HA mutants by the UPP. To extend this preliminary characterization, focused deletions within the 10 aa region were created and analyzed (Fig. 4A, IP3R1HAΔ2463-2464, IP3R1HAΔ2465-2467, IP3R1HAΔ2468-2470 and IP3R1HAΔ2471-2472). However, as compared to IP3R1HAWT (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2) and IP3R1HAΔ2473-2480 (lanes 11 and 12), none of these mutants associated with the erlin1/2 complex after stimulation with GnRH (lanes 3–10). While this suggests that the entire aa 2463 to 2472 region may be required for erlin1/2 complex binding, failure to bind could also be due to unanticipated effects on the structural integrity of IP3R1 or the IP3-induced conformational changes to IP3R1 that normally trigger erlin1/2 complex binding. To assess these parameters, the mutants were introduced into IP3R1-3KO HEK cells (23Alzayady K.J. Wang L. Chandrasekhar R. Wagner 2nd, L.E. Van Petegem F. Yule D.I. Defining the stoichiometry of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding required to initiate Ca2+ release.Sci. Signal. 2016; 9: ra35Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which exhibit high transfection efficiency, and tetramerization and Ca2+ channel activity were assessed using native PAGE and trypsin-induced Ca2+ mobilization, respectively. IP3R1HAWT and all of the mutants migrated identically at ∼1.2 MDa during native PAGE (Fig. 4C), indicating that tetramerization and overall structural integrity is normal. Interestingly, however, of the four mutants, only IP3R1HAΔ2471-2472 functioned as an IP3-activatable Ca2+ channel, exhibiting ∼73% of normal channel activity (Fig. 4D), indicating that only this mutant undergoes normal conformational changes and that failure of this mutant to bind to the erlin1/2 complex can be attributed to a specific disruption of the binding interface. In contrast, IP3R1HAΔ2463-2464, IP3R1HAΔ2465-2467, and IP3R1HAΔ2468-2470 lacked channel activity (Fig. 4D) and may be incapable of undergoing normal conformational changes, which could account for the failure of erlin1/2 complex binding. Overall, these data (summarized in Fig. 4A) indicate that the aa 2471 to 2472 region is a component of the IP3R1–erlin1/2 complex–binding site. To better define the requirements for erlin1/2 complex binding, IP3R1 mutants with substitutions in the aa 2471 to 2472 region were created and analyzed (Fig. 5A). Since D-2471 and R-2472 have negative and positive charges, respectively, these were replaced by neutral amino acids of similar size to examine the role of charge (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, each of the mutants created (IP3R1HA2471-2472DQ, IP3R1HA2471-2472NR, and IP3R1HA2471-2472NQ) bound to the erlin1/2 complex (Fig. 5B, lanes 3–8) and exhibited Ca2+ channel activity very similar to IP3R1HAWT (Fig. 5C), indicating that the charges of D-2471 and R-2472 are not required for erlin1/2 complex binding. To examine the role of size, D-2471 and R-2472 were also replaced by the much smaller amino acids, alanine and glycine (Fig. 5A). Remarkably, IP3R1HA2471-2472AA and IP3R1HA2471-2472GG both failed to bind to the erlin1/2 complex (Fig. 5B lanes 11–14) but exhibited channel activity very similar to IP3R1HAWT, in terms of both peak response and EC50 (Fig. 5D), indicating that these substitutions do not impair the ability of IP3R1 to undergo IP3-induced conformational changes that lead to channel opening but greatly impact the erlin1/2 complex–binding site. To gain additional insight, the highest resolution cryo-EM structure of IP3R1 was used to visualize the juxta-TM5 region (Fig. 5E) (7Baker M.R. Fan G. Seryshev A.B. Agosto M.A. Baker M.L. Serysheva II, Cryo-EM structure of type 1 IP(3)R channel in a lipid bilayer.Commun. Biol. 2021; 4: 625Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). D-2471 and R-2472, being part of IL3, protrude into the ER lumen and appear to be at the outer surface of the IP3R1 tetramer, which should allow for access to the erlin1/2 complex. Further, since this region of IL3 appears to lack secondary structure, the only clear difference between IP3R1WT and the nonbinding mutants is side chain length at positions 2471 and 2472. Overall, these data suggest that the size of residues in the aa 2471 to 2472 region is a crucial factor for the IP3R1–erlin1/2 complex interaction. To confirm the role of the aa 2471 to 2472 region, IP3R1HAWT and IP3R1HA2471-2472AA were stably expressed in IP3R1KO αT3 cells. The highest expressing cell lines contained ∼10% of the IP3R1 levels seen in unmodified αT3 cells (Fig. 6A). Ca2+-mobilizing activity was almost fully restored in these reconstituted IP3R1KO cell lines, with the peak responses very similar to that seen in unmodified αT3 cells (Fig. 6B), indicating that both IP3R1HAWT and IP3R1HA2471-2472AA form functional channels and undergo normal conformational changes upon stimulation. Note that the low level of Ca2+ mobilization in IP3R1KO cells is likely due to the presence of residual IP3R2 and IP3R3 (less than 1% of total IP3R levels) (21Schulman J.J. Wright F.A. Han X. Zluhan E.J. Szczesniak L.M. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. The stability and expression level of Bok are governed by binding to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 11820-11828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As expected, stably expressed IP3R1HAWT bound to the erlin1/2 complex upon GnRH stimulation but IP3R1HA2471-2472AA did not (Fig. 6C), and RNF170 association, polyubiquitination, and downregulation of IP3R1HAs followed in parallel (Fig. 6 C and D). These data confirm the importance of the aa 2471 to 2472 region for erlin1/2 complex association and for IP3R1 processing by the ERAD pathway. Sequence alignment of the N-terminal end of IL3 shows that the juxta-TM5 region is highly conserved (Fig. 7A), indicating that it might be indispensable to IP3R function. To gain more insight into why the deletion mutants in this region (IP3R1HAΔ2463-2464, IP3R1HAΔ2465-2467, and IP3R1HAΔ2468-2470) lack channel activity (Fig. 4A), substitution mutants were constructed and characterized (Fig. 7, B–D). IP3R1HA2463-2464AA, with substitutions immediately adjacent to TM5, mobilized Ca2+ well (Fig. 7C), showing that the replaced K-2463 and D-2464 are not critical for channel activity and that the structural integrity of this mutant is still maintained, despite the loss of charged residues, which could potentially affect the proper positioning of TM5 in the ER membrane (24Baker J.A. Wong W.-C. Eisenhaber B. Warwicker J. Eisenhaber F. Charged residues next to transmembrane regions revisited: “Positive-inside rule” is complemented by the “negative inside depletion/outside enrichment rule.BMC Biol. 2017; 15: 66Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, IP3R1HA2465-2467AAA completely lacked channel activity (Fig. 7C), and IP3R1HA2464-2465NN and IP3R1HAD2465N, with charge neutralizing D to N substitutions, lost either all or the vast majority of Ca2+ channel activity (Fig. 7C), indicating charges in this region, especially that of D-2465, are essential to IP3R1 channel activity. A nonspecific effect of these mutations on the positioning of TM5 is unlikely in view of the ability of IP3R1HA2463-2464AA to function normally. Finally, among the mutants, only IP3R1HA2463-2464AA was able to bind to the erlin1/2 complex (Fig. 7D), which correlates with its near normal channel activity. To better understand the importance of the juxta-TM5 region and particularly the charge of D-2465, the highest resolution cryo-EM model of IP3R1 was used to visualize the channel core (Fig. 7E) (7Baker M.R.

https://openalex.org/W4280495039,"Excessive lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis in the liver are the major characteristics of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) plays an important role in metabolic homeostasis, raising the possibility that it is involved in NASH. Here, we reduced and increased MANF levels in mice in order to explore its influence on hepatic triglyceride homeostasis, inflammation, and fibrosis during NASH progression. The MANF expression was decreased in Western diet-induced NASH mice. In vivo, liver-specific MANF knockout exacerbated hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis of mice induced by Western diet, while liver-specific MANF overexpression mitigated these NASH pathogenic features. In vitro, knocking down MANF in primary hepatocyte cultures aggravated hepatic steatosis and inflammation, which MANF overexpression markedly attenuated. Studies in vitro and in vivo suggested that MANF regulated hepatic lipid synthesis by modulating SREBP1 expression. Inhibiting SREBP1 in primary hepatocytes blocked lipid accumulation after MANF knockdown. MANF overexpression reversed LXRs agonist GW3965 induced SREBP1 and LIPIN1 expression. MANF decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting NF-κB phosphorylation. These results suggest that MANF can protect against NASH by regulating SREBP1 expression and NF-κB signaling."

Compared to normal cells, cancer cells frequently exhibit a higher diversity of their transcriptomes. A comprehensive understanding of splicing regulation is required to correct the splicing alterations for the future precision oncology. A quantitative proteomic screen was performed to identify the regulators associated the metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer. Multiple in vitro and in vivo functional analyses were used to study the effects of NSrp70 on breast cancer metastasis. Next, transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) and alternative splicing bioinformatics analysis was applied to screen the potential targets of NSrp70. Moreover, in vitro splicing assays, RNA pull-down, and RNA immunoprecipitation assay were used to confirm the specific binding between NSrp70 and downstream target genes. Furthermore, the prognostic value of NSrp70 was analyzed in a cohort of patients by performing IHC. We uncovered NSrp70 as a novel suppressor of breast cancer metastasis. We discovered that NSrp70 inhibited the skipped exon alternative splicing of NUMB, promoted the degradation of transforming growth factor receptor 1 through lysosome pathway, and regulated TGFβ/SMAD-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, high NSrp70 expression correlated with a better prognosis in breast cancer patients. Our findings revealed that splicing regulator NSrp70 serves as a metastasis suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W4280566460,"Giardiasis is a diarrheal disease caused by the unicellular parasite Giardia intestinalis, for which metronidazole is the main treatment option. The parasite is dependent on exogenous deoxyribonucleosides for DNA replication and thus is also potentially vulnerable to deoxyribonucleoside analogs. Here, we characterized the G. intestinalis thymidine kinase, a divergent member of the thymidine kinase 1 family that consists of two weakly homologous parts within one polypeptide. We found that the recombinantly expressed enzyme is monomeric, with 100-fold higher catalytic efficiency for thymidine compared to its second-best substrate, deoxyuridine, and is furthermore subject to feedback inhibition by dTTP. This efficient substrate discrimination is in line with the lack of thymidylate synthase and dUTPase in the parasite, which makes deoxy-UMP a dead-end product that is potentially harmful if converted to deoxy-UTP. We also found that the antiretroviral drug azidothymidine (AZT) was an equally good substrate as thymidine and was active against WT as well as metronidazole-resistant G. intestinalis trophozoites. This drug inhibited DNA synthesis in the parasite and efficiently decreased cyst production in vitro, which suggests that it could reduce infectivity. AZT also showed a good effect in G. intestinalis-infected gerbils, reducing both the number of trophozoites in the small intestine and the number of viable cysts in the stool. Taken together, these results suggest that the absolute dependency of the parasite on thymidine kinase for its DNA synthesis can be exploited by AZT, which has promise as a future medication effective against metronidazole-refractory giardiasis."

Mucosal subepithelial PDGFRα+ cells (MuPαC) are important regulators in various intestinal diseases including fibrosis and inflammation. However, the transcriptome of MuPαC has not yet been elucidated. Using Pdgfra-eGFP mice and flow cytometry, we isolated colonic MuPαC and obtained their transcriptome data. In analyzing the transcriptome, we identified three novel, and selectively expressed, markers (Adamdec1, Fin1, and Col6a4) found in MuPαC. In addition, we identified a unique set of MuPαC-enriched genetic signatures including groups of growth factors, transcription factors, gap junction proteins, extracellular proteins, receptors, cytokines, protein kinases, phosphatases, and peptidases. These selective groups of genetic signatures are linked to the unique cellular identity and function of MuPαC. Furthermore, we have added this MuPαC transcriptome data to our Smooth Muscle Genome Browser that contains the transcriptome data of jejunal and colonic smooth muscle cells (SMC), interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), and smooth muscle resident PDGFRα+ cells: (https://med.unr.edu/physio/transcriptome).

https://openalex.org/W4280603605,"Elastin is present in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of connective tissues, and its mechanical properties are well documented. In Marfan syndrome, however, the inability to properly code for the protein fibrillin-1 prematurely leads to the degradation and loss of elastin fiber integrity in the ECM. In this study, the role of elastin in the ECM of the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve was investigated by examining the biomechanical behavior of porcine leaflets before and after the application of the enzyme elastase. Five loading protocols were applied to the leaflet specimens in two groups (elastase-treated and control samples). The mechanical response following elastase application yielded a significantly stiffer material in both the radial and circumferential directions. At a physiological level of stress (85 kPa), the elastase group had an average strain of 26.21% and 6.32% in the radial and circumferential directions, respectively, at baseline prior to elastase application. Following elastase treatment, the average strain was 5.28% and 0.97% in the radial and circumferential directions, respectively. No statistically significant change was found in the control group following sham treatment with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Two-photon microscopy images confirmed that after the removal of elastin, the collagen fibers displayed a loss of undulation. With a significant reduction in radial compliance, the ability to withstand physiological loads may be compromised. As such, an extracellular matrix that is structurally deficient in elastin may hinder normal tricuspid valve function."
https://openalex.org/W4280619818,"The human genome contains repetitive regions, such as segmental duplications, known to be prone to copy number variation. Segmental duplications are highly identical and homologous sequences, posing a specific challenge for most mutation detection methods. The giant nebulin gene is expressed in skeletal muscle. It harbors a large segmental duplication region composed of eight exons repeated three times, the so-called triplicate region. Mutations in nebulin are known to cause nemaline myopathy and other congenital myopathies. Using our custom targeted Comparative Genomic Hybridization arrays, we have previously shown that copy number variations in the nebulin triplicate region are pathogenic when the copy number of the segmental duplication block deviates two or more copies from the normal number, which is three per allele. To complement our Comparative Genomic Hybridization arrays, we have established a custom Droplet Digital PCR method for the detection of copy number variations within the nebulin triplicate region. The custom Droplet Digital PCR assays allow sensitive, rapid, high-throughput, and cost-effective detection of copy number variations within this region and is ready for implementation a screening method for disease-causing copy number variations of the nebulin triplicate region. We suggest that Droplet Digital PCR may also be used in the study and diagnostics of other segmental duplication regions of the genome."
https://openalex.org/W4280648498,"The increase in consumer demand for high-quality food products has led to growth in the use of new technologies and ingredients. Resistant starch (RS) is a recently recognised source of fibre and has received much attention for its potential health benefits and functional properties. However, knowledge about the fate of RS in modulating complex intestinal communities, the microbial members involved in its degradation, enhancement of microbial metabolites, and its functional role in body physiology is still limited. For this purpose, the current study was designed to ratify the physiological and functional health benefits of enzymatically prepared resistant starch (EM-RSIII) from maize flour. To approve the beneficial health effects as prebiotic, EM-RSIII was supplemented in rat diets. After 21 days of the experiment, EM-RSIII fed rats showed a significant reduction in body weight gain, fecal pH, glycemic response, serum lipid profile, insulin level and reshaping gut microbiota, and enhancing short-chain fatty acid compared to control. The count of butyrate-producing and starch utilizing bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and Pediococcus genus in rat's gut, elevated after the consumption of medium and high doses of EM-RSIII, while the E. coli completely suppressed in high EM-RSIII fed rats. Short-chain fatty acids precisely increased in feces of EM-RSIII feed rats. Correlation analysis demonstrated that the effect of butyrate on functional and physiological alteration on the body had been investigated during the current study. Conclusively, the present study demonstrated the unprecedented effect of utilising EM-RSIII as a diet on body physiology and redesigning gut microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W3119320378,"Deep neural networks are widely used in pattern-recognition tasks for which a human-comprehensible, quantitative description of the data-generating process, cannot be obtained. While doing so, neural networks often produce an abstract (entangled and non-interpretable) representation of the data-generating process. This may be one of the reasons why neural networks are not yet used extensively in physics-experiment signal processing: physicists generally require their analyses to yield quantitative information about the system they study. In this article we use a deep neural network to disentangle components of oscillating time series. To this aim, we design and train the neural network on synthetic oscillating time series to perform two tasks: a regression of the signal latent parameters and signal denoising by an Autoencoder -like architecture. We show that the regression and denoising performance is similar to those of least-square curve fittings with true latent-parameters initial guesses, in spite of the neural network needing no initial guesses at all. We then explore various applications in which we believe our architecture could prove useful for time-series processing, when prior knowledge is incomplete. As an example, we employ the neural network as a preprocessing tool to inform the least-square fits when initial guesses are unknown. Moreover, we show that the regression can be performed on some latent parameters, while ignoring the existence of others. Because the Autoencoder needs no prior information about the physical model, the remaining unknown latent parameters can still be captured, thus making use of partial prior knowledge, while leaving space for data exploration and discoveries."
https://openalex.org/W4280523794,"Background Conducting a process evaluation is essential to understand how health interventions work in different healthcare settings. Particularly in the case of complex interventions, it is important to find out whether the intervention could be carried out as planned and which factors had a beneficial or hindering effect on its implementation. The aim of this study is to present the detailed protocol of the process evaluation embedded in the controlled implementation study CCC-Integrativ aiming to implement an interprofessional counselling program for cancer patients on complementary and integrative health care (CIH). Methods This mixed methods study will draw upon the “Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research” (CFIR) combined with the concept of “intervention fidelity” to evaluate the quality of the interprofessional counselling sessions, to explore the perspective of the directly and indirectly involved healthcare staff, as well as to analyze the perceptions and experiences of the patients. The qualitative evaluation phase consists of analyzing audio-recorded counselling sessions, as well as individual and group interviews with the involved persons. The quantitative evaluation phase applies questionnaires which are distributed before (T0), at the beginning (T1), in the middle (T2) and at the end (T3) of the intervention delivery. Discussion This protocol provides an example of how a process evaluation can be conducted parallel to a main study investigating and implementing a complex intervention. The results of this mixed methods research will make it possible to identify strengths and weaknesses of the team-based intervention, and to target more specifically the key factors and structures required to implement healthcare structures to meet patients’ unmet needs in the context of CIH. To our knowledge, this study is the first applying the CFIR framework in the context of interprofessional CIH counselling, and its results are expected to provide comprehensive and multidisciplinary management of cancer patients with complex supportive healthcare needs."
https://openalex.org/W4280526839,"The target in this survey is to investigate deformations of laminates shells (DLS), due to asymmetric and axisymmetric loads, including several other loadings using N-T shell equations. We point out here, the contribution of the metric change in thickness for the analysis of static and linear behavior of laminated composite shells. To achieve this objective, we’ve applied N-T’s shells equations on the same monolayer laminate composite shell and derive the law of MBLS. The macrostructure is analyzed under static loads and implemented using low order curved shell finite elements with shifted Lagrange (CSFE-sh). We tested this element on benchmarks found within the literature. The analysis of cylindrical and spherical shells subjected to uniform sinusoidal pressures and asymmetric pressures reveals excellent accuracy compared to others. The results found without any correction factor were compared with those obtained by the analytical method and other finite element models."

Moreover, patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) increasingly wish to be involved in their therapeutic decision process. Therefore, a new, patient-centric shared decision model (SDM), is gaining relevance. However, validated scales oriented to assess the quality of the process itself are lacking. The AGA-25 scale is a fit-for-purpose 25-item scale based on two validated scales in MS (Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) and Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS)). The aim of this work is to develop and validate the AGAS-25 in Spanish. Two hundred and three PwMS (aged 17 to 67; 155 [76.4%] females) undergoing stable disease modifying treatment in the last 6 months were consecutively recruited. The Principal Component Analysis suggested a four-factor structure for the 25-item version of the questionnaire: 1) satisfaction with the SDM process 2) adverse events with the DMT, 3) convenience of the chosen-DMT and 4) information reliability. The internal consistency of the measurement was adequate (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.88). Our results support the use of the AGAS-25 scale to assist SDM in Spanish-speaking PwMS."

The purpose of this study is to develop a strategy for translating the Chang-Waring chord (position of pupil centre relative to the Purkinje reflex PI) into angle Alpha using raytracing techniques.The retrospective analysis was based on a large dataset of 8959 measurements of 8959 eyes from 1 clinical centre, using the Casia2 anterior segment tomographer. An optical model based on: corneal front and back surface radius Ra and Rp, asphericities Qa and Qp, corneal thickness CCT, anterior chamber depth ACD, and pupil centre position (X-Y position: PupX and PupY), was defined for each measurement. Using raytracing rays with an incident angle IX and IY the CW chord (CWX and CWY) was calculated. Using these data, a multivariable linear model was built up in terms of a Monte-Carlo simulation for a simple translation of incident ray angle to CW chord.Raytracing allows for calculation of the CW chord CWX/CWY from biometric measures and the incident ray angle IX/IY. In our dataset mean values of CWX = 0.32±0.30 mm and CWY = -0.10±0.26 mm were derived for a mean incident ray angle (angle Alpha) of IX = -5.02±1.77° and IY = 0.01±1.47°. The raytracing results could be modelled with a linear multivariable model, and the effect sizes for the prediction model for CWX are identified as Ra, Qa, Rp, CCT, ACD, PupX, PupY, IX, and for CWY they are Ra, Rp, PupY, and IY.Today the CW chord can be directly measured with any biometer, topographer or tomographer. If biometric measures of Ra, Qa, Rp, CCT, ACD, PupX, PupY are available in addition to the CW chord components CWX and CWY, a prediction of angle Alpha is possible using a simple matrix operation."

Despite a variety of biological studies, lumbar DD is not yet fully understood, partially because there are only few studies that use systematic and integrative approaches. This urges the need for studies that integrate different omics (including genomics and transcriptomics) measured on samples within a single cohort. This protocol describes a disease-oriented Russian disc degeneration study (RuDDS) biobank recruitment and analyses aimed to facilitate further omics studies of lumbar DD integrating genomic, transcriptomic and glycomic data. A total of 1,100 participants aged over 18 with available lumbar MRI scans, medical histories and biological material (whole blood, plasma and intervertebral disc tissue samples from surgically treated patients) will be enrolled during the three-year period from two Russian clinical centers. Whole blood, plasma and disc tissue specimens will be used for genotyping with genome-wide SNP-arrays, glycome profiling and RNA sequencing, respectively. Omics data will be further used for a genome-wide association study of lumbar DD with in silico functional annotation, analysis of plasma glycome and lumbar DD disease interactions and transcriptomic data analysis including an investigation of differential expression patterns associated with lumbar DD disease. Statistical tests applied in each of the analyses will meet the standard criteria specific to the attributed study field. In a long term, the results of the study will expand fundamental knowledge about lumbar DD development and contribute to the elaboration of novel personalized approaches for disease prediction and therapy. Additionally to the lumbar disc degeneration study, a RuDDS cohort could be used for other genetic studies, as it will have unique omics data. Trial registration number NCT04600544."

One major challenge for maintaining effective control of this pest is its propensity to develop resistance to insecticides. This study utilized laboratory selection and realized heritability methods to examine the risk of resistance development to diflubenzuron in Musca domestica L. Cross-resistance (CR) to fourteen other insecticides was measured in diflubenzuron-selected (Diflu-SEL) strain which was selected for 20 generations. The resistance ratio (RR) of Diflu-SEL larvae to diflubenzuron increased from 30.33 in generation five (G 5 ) to 182.33 in G 24 compared with the susceptible strain, while realized heritability ( h 2 ) was 0.08. The number of needed generations (G) for a tenfold increase in the median lethal concentration (LC 50 ) for diflubenzuron ranged from 4 to 45 at h 2 values of 0.08, 0.18, and 0.28, at a slope of 1.51. At h 2 = 0.08 and slopes of 1.51, 2.51, and 3.51, the number of needed G for a tenfold increase in the LC 50 ranged from 9 to 104. The level of CR shown by the Diflu-SEL strain to all other fourteen tested insecticides (insect growth regulators, organophosphates, and pyrethroids) was either absent or very low compared to the field population. The value of h 2 and the absent or low CR indicate potential successful management of resistance to diflubenzuron and recommend the use of the tested insecticides in rotation with diflubenzuron to control M . domestica ."

Meanwhile, University students are mainly assessed through the lens of academic achievement, which depend, inter alia, on the self-motivated strategies for learning (MSL). Firstly, we tested hypothesised sex differences in SPE's and MSL's factors in a group of the first-year university students (n = 600) in a Central European context. Our analyses revealed that female students, despite their higher results in MSL's factors (self-regulation, learning strategies, intrinsic values, self-efficacy) presented lower internal SPE than male students. Secondly, we explored how much general SPE can be predicted from general MSL, taking into account sex as a moderator, finding that sex factor was not significant as a moderator. We can consider general MSL as a good predictor of general SPE in both sex groups. The results will provide evidence to support HEI curricular development and strategies for workplace attitude change to address existing sex inequalities. In addition, our findings relating to MSL will provide evidence to support the development of approaches to enhancing student employability with additional long term benefits in mental health and well-being."
https://openalex.org/W4280617961,"Healthcare providers are often targeted as research participants, especially for implementation science studies evaluating provider- or system-level issues. Frequently, provider eligibility is based on both provider and patient factors. Manual chart review and self-report are common provider screening strategies but require substantial time, effort, and resources. The automated use of electronic health record (EHR) data may streamline provider identification for implementation science research. Here, we describe an approach to provider screening for a Veterans Health Administration (VHA)-funded study focused on implementing risk-aligned surveillance for bladder cancer patients.Our goal was to identify providers at 6 pre-specified facilities who performed ≥10 surveillance cystoscopy procedures among bladder cancer patients in the 12 months prior to recruitment start on January 16, 2020, and who were currently practicing at 1 of 6 pre-specified facilities. Using VHA EHR data (using CPT, ICD10 procedure, and ICD10 diagnosis codes), we identified cystoscopy procedures performed after an initial bladder cancer diagnosis (i.e., surveillance procedures). Procedures were linked to VHA staff data to determine the provider of record, the number of cystoscopies they performed, and their current location of practice. To validate this approach, we performed a chart review of 105 procedures performed by a random sample of identified providers. The proportion of correctly identified procedures was calculated (Positive Predictive Value (PPV)), along with binomial 95% confidence intervals (CI).We identified 1,917,856 cystoscopies performed on 703,324 patients from October 1, 1999-January 16, 2020, across the nationwide VHA. Of those procedures, 40% were done on patients who had a prior record of bladder cancer and were completed by 15,065 distinct providers. Of those, 61 performed ≥ 10 procedures and were currently practicing at 1 of the 6 facilities of interest in the 1 year prior to study recruitment. The random chart review of 7 providers found 101 of 105 procedures (PPV: 96%; 95% CI: 91% to 99%) were surveillance procedures and were performed by the selected provider on the recorded date.These results show that EHR data can be used for accurate identification of healthcare providers as research participants when inclusion criteria consist of both patient- (temporal relationship between diagnosis and procedure) and provider-level (frequency of procedure and location of current practice) factors. As administrative codes and provider identifiers are collected in most, if not all, EHRs for billing purposes this approach can be translated from provider recruitment in VHA to other healthcare systems. Implementation studies should consider this method of screening providers."

We enrolled 394 college-age and older participants of both sexes in Ann Arbor, Michigan and the surrounding area. All participants provided an oral sample at baseline, and 130 females provided a cervicogenital sample. Samples were tested for 18 HPV genotypes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) MassArray. Participants filled out sociodemographic and behavioral questionnaires. Prevalence ratios for HPV oral or cervicogenital prevalence by predictor variables were estimated in univariable log-binomial models. Analysis was conducted 2018–20. In the full cohort, baseline oral HPV prevalence was 10.0% for any detected genotype (among the 338 valid oral tests at baseline) and 6.5% for high-risk types, and cervicogenital prevalence was 20.0% and 10.8%, respectively (among the 130 first valid cervicogenital tests). Oral HPV prevalence did not vary by sex, with 10.5% of women and 9.0% of men having an infection. We found a high prevalence of oral and cervicogenital HPV infection in college-age participants reporting no lifetime sexual partners. Reporting a single recent partner was associated with a lower oral HPV prevalence (PR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.96) than reporting no recent (but at least one ever) partner. No similar protective effect was seen for cervicogenital HPV. Both oral and cervicogenital prevalence increased with the number of recent partners for most sexual behaviors. We observed an ecological fallacy masking the direction of impact of vaccination on HPV prevalence in the full cohort compared to the college-aged and the age 23+ populations considered separately. Substance use was not significantly associated with oral or cervicogenital HPV infection. Many studies report substantially higher oral HPV infection prevalence in men than in women. That difference may not be uniform across populations in the US."

In this study we assessed the influence of brands in product preference after tasting 2 soft-drinks (Coca Cola vs. Cola beverage), by using physiological measurements, namely the skin conductance, the respiratory rate and heart rate variability (HRV) extracted using contactless sensors. The experimental protocol enrolled twenty-five young subjects which were asked to taste 2 soft drinks in random order, without knowing the brand (blind condition) and then knowing the brand (not blind condition). After each phase the subject was asked to choose the preferred beverage. Our main hypothesis is that if the subject knows the brand there is an arousal effect, independently from the absolute appreciation of the product. In order to evaluate the emotional components, the skin conductance, respiratory and Video-Photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals were continuously recorded throughout the experiment. The Video-PPG was then processed to extract HRV parameters. We observed that the arousal levels changed among beverages and conditions, going from higher arousal for Coca-Cola in the blind condition, to higher arousal for Cola in the not blind condition. Moreover, 44% of the subjects changed their preference when the brand was uncovered: from blind to not blind conditions, 6 subjects went from Cola to Coca-Cola as preferred drink and 5 went from Coca-Cola to Cola. Opposite results were found for the two beverages when comparing the physiological response when the beverage was/was not preferred. Finally, differences were found also between consumers and not consumers of Coca-Cola and the blind/not blind comparison. We conclude that the brand is a fundamental element in a request for choice and it can affect the first emotional response of a subject."
https://openalex.org/W4280556809,"The production of secondary metabolites is a major mechanism used by beneficial rhizobacteria to antagonize plant pathogens. These bacteria have evolved to coordinate the production of different secondary metabolites due to the heavy metabolic burden imposed by secondary metabolism. However, for most secondary metabolites produced by bacteria, it is not known how their biosynthesis is coordinated. Here, we showed that PhlH from the rhizobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens is a TetR-family regulator coordinating the expression of enzymes related to the biosynthesis of several secondary metabolites, including 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG), mupirocin, and pyoverdine. We present structures of PhlH in both its apo form and 2,4-DAPG-bound form and elucidate its ligand-recognizing and allosteric switching mechanisms. Moreover, we found that dissociation of 2,4-DAPG from the ligand-binding domain of PhlH was sufficient to allosterically trigger a pendulum-like movement of the DNA-binding domains within the PhlH dimer, leading to a closed-to-open conformational transition. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that two distinct conformational states were stabilized by specific hydrogen bonding interactions and that disruption of these hydrogen bonds had profound effects on the conformational transition. Our findings not only reveal a well-conserved route of allosteric signal transduction in TetR-family regulators but also provide novel mechanistic insights into bacterial metabolic coregulation."
https://openalex.org/W4280566528,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has widely spread worldwide since 2020. Several countries have imposed lockdown or stay-at-home policies to prevent the infection. Bangladesh experienced a lockdown from March 2020 to May 2020, and internal travel was restricted. Such long and strict confinement may impact women's health. Herein, we aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women's health by comparing their health status before and during the pandemic. We conducted a prospective longitudinal study in two zones in the Chhaygaon union, rural district Shariatpur, Bangladesh. The study population comprised non-pregnant women aged 15-49 years. We visited the household of all eligible women and invited them for health checkups. The survey staff examined their health status at the checkup camps and conducted questionnaire interviews. In total, 121 non-pregnant women received health checkups both from June 2019 to July 2019 and in October 2020, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Compared with those during the 2019 health checkup, the medians of body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were significantly higher (22.7 kg/m2 to 23.6 kg/m2; 110.0 mmHg to 111.0 mmHg; and 73.0 mmHg to 75.0 mmHg, respectively, p<0.05) during the 2020 health checkup. In contrast, urine glucose levels were significantly lower (10.1% to 3.4%, p = 0.021). The lack of physical activity and other inconvenience accumulation caused by the prolonged confinement might have affected their health status. This necessitates local health workers to promote physical activity to prevent health deterioration during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4280568605,"Clinical and biochemical diversity of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and numerous demographic, clinical, and pathological measures influencing cognitive function and its decline in PD create problems with the determination of effects of individual measures on cognition in PD. This is particularly the case where these measures significantly interrelate with each other producing intricate networks of direct and indirect effects on cognition. Here, we use generalized structural equation modelling (GSEM) to identify and characterize significant paths for direct and indirect effects of 14 baseline measures on global cognition in PD at baseline and at 4 years later. We consider 269 drug-naïve participants from the Parkinson’s Progression Marker Initiative database, diagnosed with idiopathic PD and observed for at least 4 years after baseline. Two GSEM networks are derived, highlighting the possibility of at least two different molecular pathways or two different PD sub-types, with either CSF p-tau181 or amyloid beta (1–42) being the primary protein variables potentially driving progression of cognitive decline. The models provide insights into the interrelations between the 14 baseline variables, and determined their total effects on cognition in early PD. High CSF amyloid concentrations (&gt; 500 pg/ml) are associated with nearly full protection against cognitive decline in early PD in the whole range of baseline age between 40 and 80 years, and irrespectively of whether p-tau181 or amyloid beta (1–42) are considered as the primary protein variables. The total effect of depression on cognition is shown to be strongly amplified by PD, but not at the time of diagnosis or at prodromal stages. CSF p-tau181 protein could not be a reliable indicator of cognitive decline because of its significantly heterogeneous effects on cognition. The outcomes will enable better understanding of the roles of the clinical and pathological measures and their mutual effects on cognition in early PD."

https://openalex.org/W4280621060,"Under the background of high-energy penetration of new energy into the power grid, this paper takes the ancillary service capability of photovoltaic energy integrated into the grid as the starting point and builds a photovoltaic system reactive power service impact evaluation model on the grid energy efficiency. This is based on the multi-temporal and spatial scale operation mode, in order to study the supporting principles of photovoltaic system reactive power services on the energy efficiency of grid operation and the law of influence on system energy efficiency changes. In this way, the space for power system energy efficiency improvement and the reactive power service market value of renewable energy are explored to improve the renewable energy auxiliary services participation in the theoretical system of electric power spot market transactions. The research conclusions can provide a decision-making reference for system dynamic energy efficiency management and can assist relevant market entities to make optimal decisions in spot market transactions, and provide empirical data for improving the theory of renewable energy participation in auxiliary service market transactions."
https://openalex.org/W4280631777,"Cats are known to be affected by hippocampal sclerosis, potentially causing antiseizure drug(s) resistance. In order to lay the foundation for a standardized, systematic classification and diagnosis of this pathology in cats, this prospective study aimed at evaluating normal reference values of cellular densities and the cytoarchitecture of the feline hippocampus. Three transverse sections (head, body and tail) of each left hippocampus were obtained from 17 non-epileptic cats of different brachycephalic and mesocephalic breeds and age classes (range: 3-17 years). Histological (hematoxylin and eosin, Nissl) and immunohistochemical (NeuN, GFAP) staining was performed to investigate neuron and astroglial cell populations, as well as the layer thickness of the pyramidal cell layer and granule cell layer. Significant differences in neuronal density (in CA2-CA4 and the granule cell layer) and layer thickness (in CA1-CA3 and the granule cell layer) were evidenced throughout the longitudinal hippocampal axis (p<0.05); on the other hand, the astrocyte density did not differ. Moreover, reference ranges were defined for these parameters in the pyramidal cell layer and in the granule cell layer. The findings did not differ according to breed or age. In veterinary medicine these parameters have not been evaluated in cats so far. As surgical treatment may become a therapeutic option for cats with temporal lobe epilepsy, estimating normal values of the hippocampal cytoarchitecture will help in the standardized histopathological examination of resected hippocampal specimens to reach a diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis."
