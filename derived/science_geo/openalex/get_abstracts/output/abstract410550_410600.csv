https://openalex.org/W2017828716,"Intestinal epithelial stem cell identity and location have been the subject of substantial research. Cells in the +4 niche are slow-cycling and label-retaining, whereas a different stem cell niche located at the crypt base is occupied by crypt base columnar (CBC) cells. CBCs are distinct from +4 cells, and the relationship between them is unknown, though both give rise to all intestinal epithelial lineages. We demonstrate that Hopx, an atypical homeobox protein, is a specific marker of +4 cells. Hopx-expressing cells give rise to CBCs and all mature intestinal epithelial lineages. Conversely, CBCs can give rise to +4 Hopx-positive cells. These findings demonstrate a bidirectional lineage relationship between active and quiescent stem cells in their niches."

These effects were predetermined by the mass distribution of the first stars, which is thought to have been fixed by a complex interplay of gas accretion and protostellar radiation. We performed radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that followed the growth of a primordial protostar through to the early stages as a star with thermo-nuclear burning. The circumstellar accretion disk was evaporated by ultraviolet radiation from the star when its mass was 43 times that of the Sun. Such massive primordial stars, in contrast to the often postulated extremely massive stars, may help explain the fact that there are no signatures of the pair-instability supernovae in abundance patterns of metal-poor stars in our galaxy."

https://openalex.org/W2094091051,"Tumor-initiating cells (T-ICs), a subpopulation of cancer cells with stem cell-like properties, are related to tumor relapse and metastasis. Our previous studies identified a distinct profile of microRNA (miRNA) expression in breast T-ICs (BT-ICs), and the dysregulated miRNAs contribute to the self-renewal and tumorigenesis of these cells. However, the underlying mechanisms for miRNA dysregulation in BT-ICs remain obscure. In the present study, we demonstrated that the expression and function of miR-34c were reduced in the BT-ICs of MCF-7 and SK-3rd cells, a breast cancer cell line enriched for BT-ICs. Ectopic expression of miR-34c reduced the self-renewal of BT-ICs, inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and suppressed migration of the tumor cells via silencing target gene Notch4. Furthermore, we identified a single hypermethylated CpG site in the promoter region of miR-34c gene that contributed to transcriptional repression of miR-34c in BT-ICs by reducing DNA binding activities of Sp1. Therefore, miR-34c reduction in BT-ICs induced by a single hypermethylated CpG site in the promoter region promotes self-renewal and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of BT-ICs."
https://openalex.org/W2061962305,"Canopies are common among autotrophs, increasing their access to light and thereby increasing competitive abilities. If viewed from above canopies may conceal objects beneath them creating a 'canopy effect'. Due to complexities in collecting 3-dimensional data, most ecosystem monitoring programmes reduce dimensionality when sampling, resorting to planar views. The resultant 'canopy effects' may bias data interpretation, particularly following disturbances. Canopy effects are especially relevant on coral reefs where coral cover is often used to evaluate and communicate ecosystem health. We show that canopies hide benthic components including massive corals and algal turfs, and as planar views are almost ubiquitously used to monitor disturbances, the loss of vulnerable canopy-forming corals may bias findings by presenting pre-existing benthic components as an altered system. Our reliance on planar views in monitoring ecosystems, especially coral cover on reefs, needs to be reassessed if we are to better understand the ecological consequences of ever more frequent disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W1973258398,"Background Effector proteins of biotrophic plant pathogenic fungi and oomycetes are delivered into host cells and play important roles in both disease development and disease resistance response. How obligate fungal pathogen effectors enter host cells is poorly understood. The Ps87 gene of Puccinia striiformis encodes a protein that is conserved in diverse fungal pathogens. Ps87 homologs from a clade containing rust fungi are predicted to be secreted. The aim of this study is to test whether Ps87 may act as an effector during Puccinia striiformis infection. Methodology/Principal Findings Yeast signal sequence trap assay showed that the rust protein Ps87 could be secreted from yeast cells, but a homolog from Magnaporthe oryzae that was not predicted to be secreted, could not. Cell re-entry and protein uptake assays showed that a region of Ps87 containing a conserved RXLR-like motif [K/R]RLTG was confirmed to be capable of delivering oomycete effector Avr1b into soybean leaf cells and carrying GFP into soybean root cells. Mutations in the Ps87 motif (KRLTG) abolished the protein translocation ability. Conclusions/Significance The results suggest that Ps87 and its secreted homologs could utilize similar protein translocation machinery as those of oomycete and other fungal pathogens. Ps87 did not show direct suppression activity on plant defense responses. These results suggest Ps87 may represent an “emerging effector” that has recently acquired the ability to enter plant cells but has not yet acquired the ability to alter host physiology."

Here, we isolated and characterized a novel cyclotide from Palicourea rigida (Rubiaceae), which was named parigidin-br1. The sequence indicated that this peptide is a member of the bracelet subfamily of cyclotides. Parigidin-br1 showed potent insecticidal activity against neonate larvae of Lepidoptera (Diatraea saccharalis), causing 60% mortality at a concentration of 1 μm but had no detectable antibacterial effects. A decrease in the in vitro viability of the insect cell line from Spodoptera frugiperda (SF-9) was observed in the presence of parigidin-br1, consistent with in vivo insecticidal activity. Transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy of SF-9 cells after incubation with parigidin-br1 or parigidin-br1-fluorescein isothiocyanate, respectively, revealed extensive cell lysis and swelling of cells, consistent with an insecticidal mechanism involving membrane disruption. This hypothesis was supported by in silico analyses, which suggested that parigidin-br1 is able to complex with cell lipids. Overall, the results suggest promise for the development of parigidin-br1 as a novel biopesticide.

https://openalex.org/W2053776269,"Inappropriate clearance of apoptotic remnants is considered to be the primary cause of systemic autoimmune diseases, like systemic lupus erythematosus. Here we demonstrate that apoptotic cells release distinct types of subcellular membranous particles (scMP) derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the plasma membrane. Both types of scMP exhibit desialylated glycotopes resulting from surface exposure of immature ER-derived glycoproteins or from surface-borne sialidase activity, respectively. Sialidase activity is activated by caspase-dependent mechanisms during apoptosis. Cleavage of sialidase Neu1 by caspase 3 was shown to be directly involved in apoptosis-related increase of surface sialidase activity. ER-derived blebs possess immature mannosidic glycoepitopes and are prioritized by macrophages during clearance. Plasma membrane-derived blebs contain nuclear chromatin (DNA and histones) but not components of the nuclear envelope. Existence of two immunologically distinct types of apoptotic blebs may provide new insights into clearance-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2106318755,"The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is released from glucose-challenged human pancreatic β cells and stimulates insulin secretion. We investigated whether plasma ABA increased during oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs and IVGTTs) in healthy human subjects. In all subjects undergoing OGTTs (n=8), plasma ABA increased over basal values (in a range from 2- to 9-fold). A positive correlation was found between the ABA area under the curve (AUC) and the glucose AUC. In 4 out of 6 IVGTTs, little or no increase of ABA levels was observed. In the remaining subjects, the ABA increase was similar to that recorded during OGTTs. GLP-1 stimulated ABA release from an insulinoma cell line and from human islets, by ~10- and 2-fold in low and high glucose, respectively. Human adipose tissue also released ABA in response to high glucose. Nanomolar ABA stimulated glucose uptake, similarly to insulin, in rat L6 myoblasts and in murine 3T3-L1 cells differentiated to adipocytes, by increasing GLUT-4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Demonstration that a glucose load in humans is followed by a physiological rise of plasma ABA, which can enhance glucose uptake by adipose tissues and muscle cells, identifies ABA as a new mammalian hormone involved in glucose metabolism.—Bruzzone, S., Ameri, P., Briatore, L., Mannino, E., Basile, G., Andraghetti, G., Grozio, A., Magnone, M., Guida, L., Scarfì, S., Salis, A., Damonte, G., Sturla, L., Nencioni, A., Fenoglio, D., Fiory, F., Miele, C., Beguinot, F., Ruvolo, V., Bormioli, M., Colombo, G., Maggi, D., Murialdo, G., Cordera, R., De Flora, A., Zocchi, E.

https://openalex.org/W1989579627,"Background Long-term β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) blockade reduces mortality in patients with heart failure. Chronic sympathetic hyperactivity in heart failure causes sustained β-AR activation, and this can deplete Ca2+ in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leading to ER stress and subsequent apoptosis. We tested the effect of β-AR blockers on ER stress pathway in experimental model of heart failure. Methods and discussions ER chaperones were markedly increased in failing hearts of patients with end-stage heart failure. In Sprague-Dawley rats, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure was induced by abdominal aortic constriction or isoproterenol subcutaneous injection. Oral β-AR blockers treatment was performed in therapy groups. Cardiac remodeling and left ventricular function were analyzed in rats failing hearts. After 4 or 8 weeks of banding, rats developed cardiac hypertrophy and failure. Cardiac expression of ER chaperones was significantly increased. Similar to the findings above, sustained isoproterenol infusion for 2 weeks induced cardiac hypertrophy and failure with increased ER chaperones and apoptosis in hearts. β-AR blockers treatment markedly attenuated these pathological changes and reduced ER stress and apoptosis in failing hearts. On the other hand, β-AR agonist isoproterenol induced ER stress and apoptosis in cultured cardiomyocytes. β-AR blockers largely prevented ER stress and protected myocytes against apoptosis. And β-AR blockade significantly suppressed the overactivation of CaMKII in isoproterenol-stimulated cardiomyocytes and failing hearts in rats. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that ER stress occurred in failing hearts and this could be reversed by β-AR blockade. Alleviation of ER stress may be an important mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of β-AR blockers on heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2064921096,"The relationships among hippocampal neurogenesis, depression and the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs have generated a considerable amount of controversy. The cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21Cip1 (p21) plays a crucial role in restraining cellular proliferation and maintaining cellular quiescence. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches the present study shows that p21 is expressed in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in early neuronal progenitors and in immature neurons, but not in mature neurons or astroglia. In vitro, proliferation is higher in neuronal progenitor cells derived from p21-/- mice compared to cells derived from wild-type mice. Proliferation is increased in neuronal progenitor cells after suppression of p21 using lentivirus expressing short hairpin RNA against p21. In vivo, chronic treatment with the non-selective antidepressant imipramine as well as the norepinephrine-selective reuptake inhibitor desipramine or the serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine all decrease p21 expression, and this was associated with increased neurogenesis. Chronic antidepressant treatment did not affect the expression of other Cdk inhibitors. Untreated p21-/- mice exhibit a higher degree of baseline neurogenesis and decreased immobility in the forced swim test. Although chronic imipramine treatment increased neurogenesis and reduced immobility in the forced swim test in wild-type mice, it reduced neurogenesis and increased immobility in p21-/- mice. These results demonstrate the unique role of p21 in the control of neurogenesis, and support the hypothesis that different classes of reuptake inhibitor-type antidepressant drugs all stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis by inhibiting p21 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1985249962,"The endocannabinoid system plays a central role in retrograde synaptic communication and may control the spread of activity in an epileptic network. Using the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy we examined the expression pattern of the Type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1-R) in the hippocampi of CD1 mice at survival times of 2 hours, 1 day, 3 days and 2 months (acute, latent and chronic phases). Based on the behavioral signs of the acute seizures, animals were classified as ""weakly"" or ""strongly"" epileptic using the modified Racine scale. Mice of the weak group had mild seizures, whereas seizures in the strong group were frequent with intense motor symptoms and the majority of these animals developed sclerosis in the chronic phase. In control samples the most intense staining of CB1-R-positive fibers was found in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in str. pyramidale of the cornu Ammonis. In weak animals no significant changes were seen at any survival time compared to controls. In strong animals, however, in the acute phase, a massive reduction in CB1-R-stained terminals occurred in the hippocampus. In the latent phase CB1-R immunoreactivity gradually recovered. In the chronic phase, CB1-immunostaining in sclerotic samples was stronger throughout the hippocampus. Quantitative electron microscopic analysis showed an increase in the number of CB1-R-positive terminals in the dentate gyrus. Moreover, the number of immunogold particles significantly increased in GABAergic terminals. Our results suggest a proconvulsive downregulation of CB1 receptors in the acute phase most probably due to receptor internalization, followed by compensatory upregulation and sprouting in the chronic phase of epilepsy. In conclusion, the changes in CB1 receptor expression pattern revealed in this study are associated with the severity of hippocampal injury initiated by acute seizures that ultimately leads to sclerosis in the vulnerable regions in the chronic phase."
https://openalex.org/W2077893873,"Butyrate, a fermentation product of fiber in the colon, acts as a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) and induces apoptosis in colon cancer (CC) cells in vitro. We have reported that the apoptotic effects of butyrate are dependent upon the hyperactivation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. However, prolonged exposure of CC cells to increasing concentrations of butyrate results in the acquisition of resistance to the Wnt/beta-catenin- and apoptosis-inducing effects of this agent, as well as cross-resistance to structurally different HDACis. Here we report that one mechanism whereby HDACi resistance arises is through the increase of beta-catenin-independent (noncanonical) Wnt signaling. Compared to HDACi-sensitive HCT-116 CC cells, HDACi-resistant HCT-R cells exhibit higher levels of AKT/PKB cell survival signaling, which is in part induced by WNT5A and its receptor ROR2. The induction of AKT signaling by HDACis is also detected in other CC cell lines, albeit to a lesser extent than in the drug-resistant HCT-R cells. The observations suggested that the apoptotic effect of butyrate and other HDACis in CC cells can be augmented by inhibitors of pAKT. In agreement with the hypothesis, the combination of MK2206, a pAKT inhibitor, and a HDACi (butyrate or LBH589) induced higher apoptosis in CC cells compared to each agent alone. The exposure to both agents also re-sensitized the HCT-R cells to apoptosis. Finally, the concept of simultaneously inducing canonical Wnt activity and suppressing AKT signaling was translated into a combination of diet-derived agents. Diet-derived pAKT inhibitors (caffeic acid phethyl ester, sulforaphane, dilallyl trisulfide) suppressed the butyrate-induced levels of pAKT, and increased the apoptotic effects of butyrate in both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant CC cells. Our findings can be translated into (a) CC therapy employing combinations of synthetic HDACis and inhibitors of pAKT, as well as (b) CC prevention based upon diets that result in sufficient amounts of butyrate and pAKT inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1966763802,"Alkamides are fatty acid amides of wide distribution in plants, structurally related to N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones (AHLs) from Gram-negative bacteria and to N- acylethanolamines (NAEs) from plants and mammals. Global analysis of gene expression changes in Arabidopsis thaliana in response to N-isobutyl decanamide, the most highly active alkamide identified to date, revealed an overrepresentation of defense-responsive transcriptional networks. In particular, genes encoding enzymes for jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis increased their expression, which occurred in parallel with JA, nitric oxide (NO) and H₂O₂ accumulation. The activity of the alkamide to confer resistance against the necrotizing fungus Botrytis cinerea was tested by inoculating Arabidopsis detached leaves with conidiospores and evaluating disease symptoms and fungal proliferation. N-isobutyl decanamide application significantly reduced necrosis caused by the pathogen and inhibited fungal proliferation. Arabidopsis mutants jar1 and coi1 altered in JA signaling and a MAP kinase mutant (mpk6), unlike salicylic acid- (SA) related mutant eds16/sid2-1, were unable to defend from fungal attack even when N-isobutyl decanamide was supplied, indicating that alkamides could modulate some necrotrophic-associated defense responses through JA-dependent and MPK6-regulated signaling pathways. Our results suggest a role of alkamides in plant immunity induction."

Through sequence comparison and the analysis of mutants and chimeras of TCP16, TCP20 (class I), and TCP4 (class II), we established that the identity of residue 11 of the class I TCP domain or the equivalent residue 15 of the class II domain, whether it is Gly or Asp, determines a preference for a class I or a class II sequence, respectively. Footprinting analysis indicated that specific DNA contacts related to these preferences are established with one of the strands of DNA. The dimerization motif also influences the selectivity of the proteins toward class I and class II sequences and determines a requirement of an extended basic region in proteins with Asp-15. We postulate that differences in orientation of base-contacting residues brought about by the presence of either Gly or Asp are responsible for the binding site preferences of TCP proteins. Expression of repressor forms of TCP16 with Asp-11 or Gly-11 differently affects leaf development.

https://openalex.org/W2089365459,"Visfatin, also known as extracellular pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), is an adipocytokine whose circulating levels are enhanced in metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Circulating visfatin levels have been positively associated with vascular damage and endothelial dysfunction. Here, we investigated the ability of visfatin to directly impair vascular reactivity in mesenteric microvessels from both male Sprague-Dawley rats and patients undergoing non-urgent, non-septic abdominal surgery. The pre-incubation of rat microvessels with visfatin (50 and 100 ng/mL) did not modify the contractile response to noradrenaline (1 pmol/L to 30 µmol/L), as determined using a small vessel myograph. However, visfatin (10 to 100 ng/mL) concentration-dependently impaired the relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh; 100 pmol/L to 3 µmol/L), without interfering with the endothelium-independent relaxation to sodium nitroprusside (1 nmol/L to 3 µmol/L). In both cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and rat microvascular preparations, visfatin (50 ng/mL) stimulated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, as determined by lucigenin-derived chemiluminiscence. The relaxation to ACh impaired by visfatin was restored by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin (10 µmol/L). Additionally, the Nampt inhibitor APO866 (10 mmol/L to 10 µmol/L), but not an insulin receptor-blocking antibody, also prevented the stimulation of NADPH oxidase and the relaxation impairment elicited by visfatin. Accordingly, the product of Nampt activity nicotinamide mononucleotide (100 nmol/L to 1 mmol/L) stimulated endothelial NADPH oxidase activity and concentration-dependently impaired ACh-induced vasorelaxation. In human mesenteric microvessels pre-contracted with 35 mmol/L potassium chloride, the endothelium-dependent vasodilation to bradykinin (1 nmol/L to 3 µmol/L) was equally impaired by visfatin and restored upon co-incubation with APO866. In conclusion, visfatin impairs endothelium-dependent relaxation through a mechanism involving NADPH oxidase stimulation and relying on Nampt enzymatic activity, and therefore arises as a potential new player in the development of endothelial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2154653366,"Neural agrin plays a pleiotropic role in skeletal muscle innervation and maturation, but its specific effects on the contractile function of aneural engineered muscle remain unknown. In this study, neonatal rat skeletal myoblasts cultured within 3-dimen-sional engineered muscle tissue constructs were treated with 10 nM soluble recombinant miniagrin and assessed using histological, biochemical, and functional assays. Depending on the treatment duration and onset time relative to the stage of myogenic differentiation, miniagrin was found to induce up to 1.7-fold increase in twitch and tetanus force amplitude. This effect was associated with the 2.3-fold up-regulation of dystrophin gene expression at 6 d after agrin removal and enhanced ACh receptor (AChR) cluster formation, but no change in cell number, expression of muscle myosin, or important aspects of intracellular Ca2+ handling. In muscle constructs with endogenous ACh levels suppressed by the application of α-NETA, miniagrin increased AChR clustering and twitch force amplitude but failed to improve intracellular Ca2+ handling and increase tetanus-to-twitch ratio. Overall, our studies suggest that besides its synaptogenic function that could promote integration of engineered muscle constructs in vivo, neural agrin can directly promote the contractile function of aneural engineered muscle via mechanisms distinct from those involving endogenous ACh.—Bian, W., Bursac, N.

https://openalex.org/W2112265284,"It is well known that spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) develop muscle pathologies with hypertension and heart failure, though the mechanism remains poorly understood. Woon et al. (2007) linked the circadian clock gene Bmal1 to hypertension and metabolic dysfunction in the SHR. Building on these findings, we compared the expression pattern of several core-clock genes in the gastrocnemius muscle of aged SHR (80 weeks; overt heart failure) compared to aged-matched control WKY strain. Heart failure was associated with marked effects on the expression of Bmal1, Clock and Rora in addition to several non-circadian genes important in regulating skeletal muscle phenotype including Mck, Ttn and Mef2c. We next performed circadian time-course collections at a young age (8 weeks; pre-hypertensive) and adult age (22 weeks; hypertensive) to determine if clock gene expression was disrupted in gastrocnemius, heart and liver tissues prior to or after the rats became hypertensive. We found that hypertensive/hypertrophic SHR showed a dampening of peak Bmal1 and Rev-erb expression in the liver, and the clock-controlled gene Pgc1α in the gastrocnemius. In addition, the core-clock gene Clock and the muscle-specific, clock-controlled gene Myod1, no longer maintained a circadian pattern of expression in gastrocnemius from the hypertensive SHR. These findings provide a framework to suggest a mechanism whereby chronic heart failure leads to skeletal muscle pathologies; prolonged dysregulation of the molecular clock in skeletal muscle results in altered Clock, Pgc1α and Myod1 expression which in turn leads to the mis-regulation of target genes important for mechanical and metabolic function of skeletal muscle."

Decreasing LIS1 expression by shRNA dramatically attenuated osteoclast formation and function, as shown by a decreased number of mature osteoclasts differentiated from bone marrow macrophages, diminished resorption pits formation, and reduced level of CTx-I, a bone resorption marker. The ablated osteoclast formation in LIS1-depleted macrophages was associated with a significant decrease in macrophage proliferation, osteoclast survival and differentiation, which were caused by reduced activation of ERK and AKT by M-CSF, prolonged RANKL-induced JNK activation and declined expression of NFAT-c1, a master transcription factor of osteoclast differentiation. Consistent with its critical role in microtubule organization and dynein function in other cell types, we found that LIS1 binds to and colocalizes with dynein in osteoclasts. Loss of LIS1 led to disorganized microtubules and aberrant dynein function. More importantly, the depletion of LIS1 in osteoclasts inhibited the secretion of Cathepsin K, a crucial lysosomal hydrolase for bone degradation, and reduced the motility of osteoclast precursors. These results indicate that LIS1 is a previously unrecognized regulator of osteoclast formation, microtubule organization, and lysosomal secretion by virtue of its ability to modulate dynein function and Plekhm1."
https://openalex.org/W2053004479,"Transport metabolons have been discussed between carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) and several membrane transporters. We have now studied different CA isoforms, expressed in Xenopus oocytes alone and together with the electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter 1 (NBCe1), to determine their catalytic activity and their ability to enhance NBCe1 transport activity. pH measurements in intact oocytes indicated similar activity of CAI, CAII and CAIII, while in vitro CAIII had no measurable activity and CAI only 30% of the activity of CAII. All three CA isoforms increased transport activity of NBCe1, as measured by the transport current and the rate of intracellular sodium rise in oocytes. Two CAII mutants, altered in their intramolecular proton pathway, CAII-H64A and CAII-Y7F, showed significant catalytic activity and also enhanced NBCe1 transport activity. The effect of CAI, CAII, and CAII mutants on NBCe1 activity could be reversed by blocking CA activity with ethoxyzolamide (EZA, 10 µM), while the effect of the less EZA-sensitive CAIII was not reversed. Our results indicate that different CA isoforms and mutants, even if they show little enzymatic activity in vitro, may display significant catalytic activity in intact cells, and that the ability of CA to enhance NBCe1 transport appears to depend primarily on its catalytic activity."

Castillo S.S. Goldkorn T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Levy M. Khan E. Careaga M. Goldkorn T. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2009; 297: L125-L133Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Importantly, we demonstrated that nSMase2 functions as a key target in CS/ox-stress-induced lung injury. Indeed, we not only found that nSMase2 is necessary in elevating ceramide and inducing apoptosis in lungs of rodents exposed to CS, but also that nSMase2 is overexpressed in those rodent lungs and in the lungs of humans (smokers) diagnosed with pulmonary emphysema (19Filosto S.

With such a critical role for nSMase2 in generating ceramide and thereby inducing apoptosis and lung injury, it has became crucial to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) that regulates its function in response to ox-stress.We have recently shown that nSMase2 is a phospho-protein in which the level of phosphorylation is modulated by ox-stress, which also controls nSMase2 function (21Filosto S. Fry W. Knowlton A.A. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10213-10222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that calcineurin (CaN) phosphatase (also known as protein phosphatase 2B) directly binds to nSMase2, dephosphorylates it, and thereby, leads to its deactivation. However, under H2O2-induced ox-stress, when CaN is degraded, nSMase2 is fully phosphorylated and activated, downstream of protein kinase C (PKC) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (21Filosto S. Fry W. Knowlton A.A. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10213-10222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).In this study, we sought to determine the specific phosphorylation site(s) of nSMase2 and their role in regulating nSMase2 function under exposure of HAE cells to ox-stress. We present herein five serines that are phosphorylated in nSMase2 and demonstrate that the phosphorylation of these serines controls nSMase2 activity in an interdependent manner. Lastly, we found that the nSMase2 protein stability, and thus, its level of expression is determined post-translationally by the phosphorylation of those five serines.DISCUSSIONnSMase2 was previously found in the brain (29Hofmann K. Tomiuk S. Wolff G. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and recent studies indicate a role for nSMase2 in aging (17Nikolova-Karakashian M. Karakashian A. Rutkute K. Subcell. Biochem. 2008; 49: 469-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and in Alzheimer disease (30Satoi H. Tomimoto H. Ohtani R. Kitano T. Kondo T. Watanabe M. Oka N. Akiguchi I. Furuya S. Hirabayashi Y. Okazaki T. Neuroscience. 2005; 130: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). At the same time, we reported that ox-stress induced by H2O2 or CS up-regulates ceramide generation by sphingomyelin hydrolysis and causes pathological cell death in HAE cells (4Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Shannon M. Chea V. Matsukuma K. Gilchrist D. Wang H. Chan C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3209-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Levy M. Castillo S.S. Goldkorn T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Importantly, airway epithelial cells are the first line of defense for the lung and are thus extensively exposed to reactive oxidants.This led to the proposal that there must be a specific SMase that is modulated by ox-stress in lung epithelial cells, which was followed by the isolation of the novel nSMase2 from monkey lung tissue and from HAE cells (7Levy M. Castillo S.S. Goldkorn T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It was then demonstrated (7Levy M. Castillo S.S. Goldkorn T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Levy M. Khan E. Careaga M. Goldkorn T. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2009; 297: L125-L133Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that upon siRNA silencing of nSMase2, lung epithelial cells could not undergo cell death in response to CS exposure or H2O2-induced ox-stress, suggesting that nSMase2 could be a critical target not only in the brain pathogenesis but also in ox-stress/CS-induced lung injury in respiratory diseases.According to current models, sphingomyelin may be constitutively metabolized to ceramide by several SMases, but some SMases may have special patho-physiological significance (32Uhlig S. Gulbins E. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2008; 178: 1100-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Levy et al. (7Levy M. Castillo S.S. Goldkorn T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2443-2452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have reported that the major SMase enzyme that becomes activated by ox-stress appears to be nSMase2 (SMPD3), which is expressed in the Golgi, in the plasma membrane, and in endosomal compartments (7Levy M. Castillo S.S. Goldkorn T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Marchesini N. Osta W. Bielawski J. Luberto C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Goldkorn T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2011; 44: 350-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mice heterozygous for nSMase2 had less ceramide accumulation in the lung in comparison with WT mice when exposed to CS-induced ox-stress; on the other hand, knock-out mice for acidic SMase could accumulate ceramide under CS exposure as much as the WT mice, demonstrating that only nSMase2 and not acidic SMase is modulated by CS (19Filosto S. Castillo S. Danielson A. Franzi L. Khan E. Kenyon N. Last J. Pinkerton K. Tuder R. Goldkorn T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2011; 44: 350-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Finally, we found that lung tissues from patients with emphysema (smokers) displayed significantly higher levels of nSMase2 expression as compared with lung tissues from control subjects. Together, these data establish the central in vivo role of nSMase2 in ceramide generation, aberrant apoptosis, and lung injury under CS exposure, underscoring its promise as a novel target for the prevention of CS/ox-stress-induced airspace destruction, and thus, the importance of elucidating the molecular mechanism of nSMase2 activation under ox-stress (21Filosto S. Fry W. Knowlton A.A. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10213-10222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Here we show that nSMase2 is a phospho-protein exclusively phosphorylated at serine residues. Previously, we reported (21Filosto S. Fry W. Knowlton A.A. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10213-10222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that the level of nSMase2 phosphorylation can be modulated by treatment with anisomycin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), suggesting that p38 MAPK and protein kinases C(s) are upstream of nSMase2 phosphorylation. ox-stress enhances both the activity and the phosphorylation of nSMase2. Importantly, nSMase2 was found to be bound directly by the phosphatase CaN, which acts as an on/off switch for nSMase2 phosphorylation in the presence or absence of ox-stress. Specifically, CaN is being inhibited/degraded and therefore does not bind nSMase2 under ox-stress, and a mutant nSMase2 that lacks the CaN binding site exhibits constitutively elevated phosphorylation and activity relative to WT nSMase2. Importantly, the phosphorylation and activity of the mutant no longer respond to ox-stress, confirming that CaN is a critical link that allows ox-stress to modulate nSMase2 phosphorylation and function. Here, we moved forward to identify the five serines that are phosphorylated in nSMase2 and found that these serines consist of a group of conserved phosphorylation sites: Ser-173 and Ser-208, which are located in proximity of the CaN binding site (21Filosto S. Fry W. Knowlton A.A. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10213-10222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and Ser-289, Ser-292, and Ser-299, which are adjacent to the catalytic domain of nSMase2.Acknowledging the complexity of the nSMase2 regulatory mechanism(s), we speculated that these conserved sites may both affect the overall nSMase2 protein stability and modulate its activity. Moreover, we predicted that these phosphorylation sites could be interdependently regulated. Indeed, Dr. Hannun and colleagues (1Clarke C.J. Wu B.X. Hannun Y.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2011; 51: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) speculated that not only is it possible that different phosphorylation site(s) can control different aspects of nSMase2 function (activity, subcellular localization/trafficking, and protein stability), but also that those phosphorylation sites can either positively or negatively control each other.We first identified Ser-173 to have a significant role in the ability of nSMase2 to be activated under ox-stress. Equally important, we found that Ser-208 has a critical role in maintaining the stability of nSMase2. Interestingly, these residues are located in proximity to the CaN binding site. However, despite their essential roles, these sites of phosphorylation turned out to be somehow dependent on the other cluster of three serines, Ser-289-Ser-292-Ser-299, which are adjacent to the nSMase2 catalytic domain.We first generated an nSMase2 mutant lacking all five phospho-serines (Full-MT) and showed that in comparison with the WT nSMase2, such a Full-MT loses its receptiveness to ox-stress, being unable to be both phosphorylated and activated under H2O2 exposure (Fig. 2). Subsequently, we mutated only the serine 173 to alanine (S173A-MT) and found that this S173A-MT behaves like the Full-MT in terms of lack of ox-stress-inducible phosphorylation and activation (Fig. 3), demonstrating that the phosphorylation of Ser-173 controls nSMase2 activation in response to ox-stress. However, when we mutated either the serines Ser-289-Ser-292-Ser-299 (Triple-MT) or all the phospho-serines except the serine 173 (4-SER-MT), the ox-stress-dependent activation of nSMase2 was also lost, as it was for the single point mutant S173A-MT. Moreover, the 4-SER-MT and the Triple-MT nSMase2, although still harboring an intact serine 173, did not show increased phosphorylation levels upon ox-stress (Fig. 4, B and C), demonstrating that Ser-173 phosphorylation is not modulated by ox-stress independently of the serines Ser-289, Ser-292, and Ser-299. The three serines 289, 292, and 299 turn out to be all equally important in controlling nSMase2 activity (Fig. 5). However, the single point mutation of either Ser-289, Ser-292, or Ser-299 causes a constitutive increase of nSMase activity (in respect to WT activity) that is not observed for the mutant of Ser-173 (or Ser-208) (Fig. 3A). This indicates that although Ser-289, Ser-292, and Ser-299 have a certain role in nSMase2 structure/function, it is only Ser-173 phosphorylation that controls the ox-stress-inducible nSMase2 activation. In addition, it is possible that the phosphorylation on Ser-289, Ser-292, or Ser-299, respectively, may have a role in maintaining nSMase2 in an autoinhibited protein structure, which would be released by the phosphorylation of serine 173.We have previously shown that nSMase2 protein levels are increased in lungs of rodents exposed to CS-induced ox-stress, as well as in the lungs of human smokers with pulmonary emphysema (19Filosto S. Castillo S. Danielson A. Franzi L. Khan E. Kenyon N. Last J. Pinkerton K. Tuder R. Goldkorn T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2011; 44: 350-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that a mutant nSMase2 that cannot be bound by CaN (CaN-MT), and thus, is more phosphorylated than the WT nSMase2 (21Filosto S. Fry W. Knowlton A.A. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10213-10222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), maintains a protein half-life of roughly nine times higher than that of the WT nSMase2 (Fig. 6). It is therefore likely that one possible mechanism that may lead to higher nSMase2 expression in the lungs upon ox-stress (19Filosto S. Castillo S. Danielson A. Franzi L. Khan E. Kenyon N. Last J. Pinkerton K. Tuder R. Goldkorn T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2011; 44: 350-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) is dependent on the post-translational stabilization of nSMase2 that cannot bind CaN under ox-stress exposure (see model in Fig. 7). However, the fine-tuning of the molecular signals connecting nSMase2 phosphorylation and protein stability are yet to be better defined. For example, we found that the phosphorylation of serine 173, which controls the activation of nSMase2 upon ox-stress, may not be involved in stabilizing the protein, whereas serine 208 phosphorylation may be necessary for nSMase2 protein stability. At the same time, serine 208 phosphorylation stabilizes nSMase2 protein only in cooperation with the phosphorylation of the cluster Ser-289-Ser-292-Ser-299, further indicating that intact phosphorylation of Ser-289, Ser-292, and Ser-299 is essential for the proper nSMase2 structure/function. Very importantly, one plausible conclusion is that although enhanced stability and increased activity of the nSMase2 protein may both depend on its enhanced phosphorylation, the two may be regulated independently.In summary, we have identified five specific serines that are phosphorylated in nSMase2 and further demonstrate that phosphorylation of those serines controls both nSMase2 activity and nSMase2 stabilization. We found that intact phospho-serines 173, 289, 292, and 299 are required for nSMase2 activation following ox-stress exposure of HAE cells, whereas phosphorylation of serine 208 seems to play a role in stabilizing the nSMase2 protein. Overall, this study provides initial structure/function insights regarding nSMase2 phosphorylation sites and offers some new links for future studies aiming to fully elucidate nSMase2 regulatory machinery (see model in Fig. 7).

Indeed, we not only found that nSMase2 is necessary in elevating ceramide and inducing apoptosis in lungs of rodents exposed to CS, but also that nSMase2 is overexpressed in those rodent lungs and in the lungs of humans (smokers) diagnosed with pulmonary emphysema (19Filosto S.

With such a critical role for nSMase2 in generating ceramide and thereby inducing apoptosis and lung injury, it has became crucial to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) that regulates its function in response to ox-stress.We have recently shown that nSMase2 is a phospho-protein in which the level of phosphorylation is modulated by ox-stress, which also controls nSMase2 function (21Filosto S. Fry W. Knowlton A.A. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10213-10222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that calcineurin (CaN) phosphatase (also known as protein phosphatase 2B) directly binds to nSMase2, dephosphorylates it, and thereby, leads to its deactivation. However, under H2O2-induced ox-stress, when CaN is degraded, nSMase2 is fully phosphorylated and activated, downstream of protein kinase C (PKC) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (21Filosto S.

Chem. 2010; 285: 10213-10222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).In this study, we sought to determine the specific phosphorylation site(s) of nSMase2 and their role in regulating nSMase2 function under exposure of HAE cells to ox-stress. We present herein five serines that are phosphorylated in nSMase2 and demonstrate that the phosphorylation of these serines controls nSMase2 activity in an interdependent manner. Lastly, we found that the nSMase2 protein stability, and thus, its level of expression is determined post-translationally by the phosphorylation of those five serines.

https://openalex.org/W2117610355,"Maternal smoking leads to intrauterine undernutrition and is associated with low birthweight and higher risk of offspring obesity. Intrauterine smoke exposure (SE) may alter neuroendocrine mediators regulating energy homeostasis as chemicals in cigarette smoke can reach the fetus. Maternal high-fat diet (HFD) consumption causes fetal overnutrition; however, combined effects of HFD and SE are unknown. Thus we investigated the impact of combined maternal HFD and SE on adiposity and energy metabolism in offspring.Female Balb/c mice had SE (2 cigarettes/day, 5 days/week) or were sham exposed for 5 weeks before mating. Half of each group was fed HFD (33% fat) versus chow as control. The same treatment continued throughout gestation and lactation. Female offspring were fed chow after weaning and sacrificed at 12 weeks.Birthweights were similar across maternal groups. Faster growth was evident in pups from SE and/or HFD dams before weaning. At 12 weeks, offspring from HFD-fed dams were significantly heavier than those from chow-fed dams (chow-sham 17.6±0.3 g; chow-SE 17.8±0.2 g; HFD-sham 18.7±0.3 g; HFD-SE 18.8±0.4 g, P<0.05 maternal diet effect); fat mass was significantly greater in offspring from chow+SE, HFD+SE and HFD+sham dams. Both maternal HFD and SE affected brain lactate transport. Glucose intolerance and impaired brain response to insulin were observed in SE offspring, and this was aggravated by maternal HFD consumption.While maternal HFD led to increased body weight in offspring, maternal SE independently programmed adverse health outcomes in offspring. A smoke free environment and healthy diet during pregnancy is desirable to optimize offspring health."
https://openalex.org/W1981518793,"Sensory hair cells and supporting cells of the mammalian inner ear are quiescent cells, which do not regenerate. In contrast, non-mammalian supporting cells have the ability to re-enter the cell cycle and produce replacement hair cells. Earlier studies have demonstrated cyclin D1 expression in the developing mouse supporting cells and its downregulation along maturation. In explant cultures of the mouse utricle, we have here focused on the cell cycle control mechanisms and proliferative potential of adult supporting cells. These cells were forced into the cell cycle through adenoviral-mediated cyclin D1 overexpression. Ectopic cyclin D1 triggered robust cell cycle re-entry of supporting cells, accompanied by changes in p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 expressions. Main part of cell cycle reactivated supporting cells were DNA damaged and arrested at the G2/M boundary. Only small numbers of mitotic supporting cells and rare cells with signs of two successive replications were found. Ectopic cyclin D1-triggered cell cycle reactivation did not lead to hyperplasia of the sensory epithelium. In addition, a part of ectopic cyclin D1 was sequestered in the cytoplasm, reflecting its ineffective nuclear import. Combined, our data reveal intrinsic barriers that limit proliferative capacity of utricular supporting cells."
https://openalex.org/W2021159263,"Leptin acts on the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to modulate neuronal function and feeding behavior in rats and mice. To identify the intracellular effectors of the leptin receptor (Lepr), downstream signal transduction events were assessed for regulation by direct leptin infusion. Phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 (pERK1/2) were increased in the VTA while phospho-AKT (pAKT) was unaffected. Pretreatment of brain slices with the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase -1 and -2 (MEK1/2) inhibitor U0126 blocked the leptin-mediated decrease in firing frequency of VTA dopamine neurons. The anorexigenic effects of VTA-administered leptin were also blocked by pretreatment with U0126, which effectively blocked phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but not STAT3. These data demonstrate that pERK1/2 may have a critical role in mediating both the electrophysiogical and behavioral effects of leptin receptor signaling in the VTA."
https://openalex.org/W2029421341,"In extensive liver resection secondary to primary or metastatic liver tumors, or in living donor liver transplantation, strategies to quell deleterious inflammatory responses and facilitate regeneration are essential. The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and myeloid differentiating factor 88 (Myd88) are implicated in the inflammatory response. To establish the contributions of RAGE vs. Myd88 signaling in extensive liver resection, we probed the effect of RAGE and/or Myd88, the latter primarily a key transducer of major toll-like receptors and also implicated in interleukin-1 (Il1) signaling, in a murine model of extensive (85%) hepatectomy. We report that, although Myd88 is thoroughly essential for survival via regulation of NF-κB and TNF-α, deletion of RAGE significantly improved survival compared to wild-type, Myd88-null, or RAGE-null/Myd88-null mice. RAGE opposes Myd88 signaling at multiple levels: by suppression of p65 levels, thereby reducing activation of NF-κB and consequent production of cyclin D1, and by suppression of Il6-mediated phosphorylation of Stat3, thereby down-regulating Pim1 and suppressing the hyperplastic response. Further, RAGE-dependent suppression of glyoxalase1, a detoxification pathway for pre-AGEs, enhances AGE levels and suppresses Il6 action. We conclude that blockade of RAGE may rescue liver remnants from the multiple signals that preclude adaptive proliferation triggered primarily by Myd88 signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1965417034,"Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) is a highly conserved, ubiquitous flavoprotein localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. In vivo, AIF provides protection against neuronal and cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. Conversely in vitro, AIF has been demonstrated to have a pro-apoptotic role upon induction of the mitochondrial death pathway, once AIF translocates to the nucleus where it facilitates chromatin condensation and large scale DNA fragmentation. Given that the aif hypomorphic harlequin (Hq) mutant mouse model displays severe sarcopenia, we examined skeletal muscle from the aif hypomorphic mice in more detail. Adult AIF-deficient skeletal myofibers display oxidative stress and a severe form of atrophy, associated with a loss of myonuclei and a fast to slow fiber type switch, both in ""slow"" muscles such as soleus, as well as in ""fast"" muscles such as extensor digitorum longus, most likely resulting from an increase of MEF2 activity. This fiber type switch was conserved in regenerated soleus and EDL muscles of Hq mice subjected to cardiotoxin injection. In addition, muscle regeneration in soleus and EDL muscles of Hq mice was severely delayed. Freshly cultured myofibers, soleus and EDL muscle sections from Hq mice displayed a decreased satellite cell pool, which could be rescued by pretreating aif hypomorphic mice with the manganese-salen free radical scavenger EUK-8. Satellite cell activation seems to be abnormally long in Hq primary culture compared to controls. However, AIF deficiency did not affect myoblast cell proliferation and differentiation. Thus, AIF protects skeletal muscles against oxidative stress-induced damage probably by protecting satellite cells against oxidative stress and maintaining skeletal muscle stem cell number and activation."
https://openalex.org/W2029307482,"Ulcerative colitis is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by local inflammation and impaired epithelial barrier. Previous studies demonstrated that CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) antagonists could reduce colonic inflammation and mucosal damage in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Whether CXCR4 antagonist has action on intestinal barrier and the possible mechanism, is largely undefined. In the present study, the experimental colitis was induced by administration of 5% DSS for 7 days, and CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 was administered intraperitoneally once daily during the study period. For in vitro study, HT-29/B6 colonic cells were treated with cytokines or AMD3100 for 24 h until assay. DSS-induced colitis was characterized by morphologic changes in mice. In AMD3100-treated mice, epithelial destruction, inflammatory infiltration, and submucosal edema were markedly reduced, and the disease activity index was also significantly decreased. Increased intestinal permeability in DSS-induced colitis was also significantly reduced by AMD3100. The expressions of colonic claudin-1, claudin-3, claudin-5, claudin-7 and claudin-8 were markedly decreased after DSS administration, whereas colonic claudin-2 expression was significantly decreased. Treatment with AMD3100 prevented all these changes. However, AMD3100 had no influence on claudin-3, claudin-5, claudin-7 and claudin-8 expression in HT-29/B6 cells. Cytokines as TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ increased apoptosis and monolayer permeability, inhibited the wound-healing and the claudin-3, claudin-7 and claudin-8 expression in HT-29/B6 cells. We suggest that AMD3100 acted on colonic claudin expression and intestinal barrier function, at least partly, in a cytokine-dependent pathway."

However, it is still unclear whether these loci identified in the Caucasian GWA studies also exert the same effect on lipid concentrations in the Chinese population. Methods and Results We conducted a replication study assessing associations between SNPs at 15 loci and blood lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in two Chinese cohorts, comprising 2533 and 2105 individuals respectively. SNPs in APO(A1/C3/A4/A5), TIMD4-HAVCR1, DOCK7, TRIB1, ABCA1, and TOMM40-APOE showed strong associations with at least one lipids trait, and rs174546 in FADS1/2/3 showed modest association with triglyceride in the Chinese population. Conclusions We successfully replicated 7 loci associated plasma lipid concentrations in the Chinese population. Our study confirmed the implication of APO(A1/C3/A4/A5), TOMM40-APOE, ABCA1, DOCK7, TIMD4-HAVCR1, TRIB1 and FADS1/2 in plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W2071268383,"RpkA (Receptor phosphatidylinositol kinase A) is an unusual seven-helix transmembrane protein of Dictyostelium discoideum with a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signature and a C-terminal lipid kinase domain (GPCR-PIPK) predicted as a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase. RpkA-homologs are present in all so far sequenced Dictyostelidae as well as in several other lower eukaryotes like the oomycete Phytophthora, and in the Legionella host Acanthamoeba castellani. Here we show by immunofluorescence that RpkA localizes to endosomal membranes and is specifically recruited to phagosomes. RpkA interacts with the phagosomal protein complex V-ATPase as proteins of this complex co-precipitate with RpkA-GFP as well as with the GST-tagged PIPK domain of RpkA. Loss of RpkA leads to a defect in phagocytosis as measured by yeast particle uptake. The uptake of the pathogenic bacterium Legionella pneumophila was however unaltered whereas its intra-cellular replication was significantly enhanced in rpkA(-). The difference between wild type and rpkA(-) was even more prominent when L. hackeliae was used. When we investigated the reason for the enhanced susceptibility for L. pneumophila of rpkA(-) we could not detect a difference in endosomal pH but rpkA(-) showed depletion of phosphoinositides (PIP and PIP(2)) when we compared metabolically labeled phosphoinositides from wild type and rpkA(-). Furthermore rpkA(-) exhibited reduced nitrogen starvation tolerance, an indicator for a reduced autophagy rate. Our results indicate that RpkA is a component of the defense system of D. discoideum as well as other lower eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2165876270,"Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and related Ipomoea species are frequently infected by monopartite begomoviruses (genus Begomovirus, family Geminiviridae), known as sweepoviruses. Unlike other geminiviruses, the genomes of sweepoviruses have been recalcitrant to rendering infectious clones to date. Thus, Koch's postulates have not been fullfilled for any of the viruses in this group. Three novel species of sweepoviruses have recently been described in Spain: Sweet potato leaf curl Lanzarote virus (SPLCLaV), Sweet potato leaf curl Spain virus (SPLCSV) and Sweet potato leaf curl Canary virus (SPLCCaV). Here we describe the generation of the first infectious clone of an isolate (ES:MAL:BG30:06) of SPLCLaV. The clone consisted of a complete tandem dimeric viral genome in a binary vector. Successful infection by agroinoculation of several species of Ipomoea (including sweet potato) and Nicotiana benthamiana was confirmed by PCR, dot blot and Southern blot hybridization. Symptoms observed in infected plants consisted of leaf curl, yellowing, growth reduction and vein yellowing. Two varieties of sweet potato, 'Beauregard' and 'Promesa', were infected by agroinoculation, and symptoms of leaf curl and interveinal loss of purple colouration were observed, respectively. The virus present in agroinfected plants was readily transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci to I. setosa plants. The progeny virus population present in agroinfected I. setosa and sweet potato plants was isolated and identity to the original isolate was confirmed by sequencing. Therefore, Koch's postulates were fulfilled for the first time for a sweepovirus."
https://openalex.org/W2024489319,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a common and often fatal malignancy. Immunochemotherapy, a combination of rituximab to standard chemotherapy, has resulted in improved survival. However a substantial proportion of patients still fail to reach sustained remission. We have previously demonstrated that autocrine brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) production plays a function in human B cell survival, at least partly via sortilin expression. As neurotrophin receptor (Trks) signaling involved activation of survival pathways that are inhibited by rituximab, we speculated that neurotrophins may provide additional support for tumour cell survival and therapeutic resistance in DLBCL.In the present study, we used two DLBCL cell lines, SUDHL4 and SUDHL6, known to be respectively less and more sensitive to rituximab. We found by RT-PCR, western blotting, cytometry and confocal microscopy that both cell lines expressed, in normal culture conditions, BDNF and to a lesser extent NGF, as well as truncated TrkB and p75(NTR)/sortilin death neurotrophin receptors. Furthermore, BDNF secretion was detected in cell supernatants. NGF and BDNF production and Trk receptor expression, including TrkA, are regulated by apoptotic conditions (serum deprivation or rituximab exposure). Indeed, we show for the first time that rituximab exposure of DLBCL cell lines induces NGF secretion and that differences in rituximab sensitivity are associated with differential expression patterns of neurotrophins and their receptors (TrkA). Finally, these cells are sensitive to the Trk-inhibitor, K252a, as shown by the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, K252a exhibits additive cytotoxic effects with rituximab.Collectively, these data strongly suggest that a neurotrophin axis, such NGF/TrkA pathway, may contribute to malignant cell survival and rituximab resistance in DLBCL."
https://openalex.org/W2067658292,"Background It is known that bone mineral density (BMD) predicts the fracture's risk only partially and the severity and number of vertebral fractures are predictive of subsequent osteoporotic fractures (OF). Spinal deformity index (SDI) integrates the severity and number of morphometric vertebral fractures. Nowadays, there is interest in developing algorithms that use traditional statistics for predicting OF. Some studies suggest their poor sensitivity. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) could represent an alternative. So far, no study investigated ANNs ability in predicting OF and SDI. The aim of the present study is to compare ANNs and Logistic Regression (LR) in recognising, on the basis of osteoporotic risk-factors and other clinical information, patients with SDI≥1 and SDI≥5 from those with SDI = 0. Methodology We compared ANNs prognostic performance with that of LR in identifying SDI≥1/SDI≥5 in 372 women with postmenopausal-osteoporosis (SDI≥1, n = 176; SDI = 0, n = 196; SDI≥5, n = 51), using 45 variables (44 clinical parameters plus BMD). ANNs were allowed to choose relevant input data automatically (TWIST-system-Semeion). Among 45 variables, 17 and 25 were selected by TWIST-system-Semeion, in SDI≥1 vs SDI = 0 (first) and SDI≥5 vs SDI = 0 (second) analysis. In the first analysis sensitivity of LR and ANNs was 35.8% and 72.5%, specificity 76.5% and 78.5% and accuracy 56.2% and 75.5%, respectively. In the second analysis, sensitivity of LR and ANNs was 37.3% and 74.8%, specificity 90.3% and 87.8%, and accuracy 63.8% and 81.3%, respectively. Conclusions ANNs showed a better performance in identifying both SDI≥1 and SDI≥5, with a higher sensitivity, suggesting its promising role in the development of algorithm for predicting OF."
https://openalex.org/W2090844420,"In HIV-infected individuals, mechanisms underlying unsatisfactory immune recovery during effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) have yet to be fully understood. We investigated whether polymorphism of genes encoding immune-regulating molecules, such as killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) and their ligands class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA), could influence immunological response to cART.KIR and HLA frequencies were analyzed in 154 HIV-infected and cART-treated patients with undetectable viral load divided into two groups: 'immunological non responders' (INR, N = 50, CD4(+) T-cell count <200/mm(3)) and full responders (FR, N = 104, CD4(+) T-cell count >350/mm(3)). Molecular KIR were typed using polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping. Comparisons were adjusted for baseline patient characteristics.The frequency of KIR2DL3 allele was significantly higher in FR than in INR (83.7% vs. 62%, P = 0.005). The functional compound genotype HLA-C1(+)/KIR2DL3(+), even at multivariable analysis, when adjusted for nadir CD4(+) T-cell count, was associated with reduced risk of INR status: odds ratio (95% Confidence Intervals) 0.34 (0.13-0.88), P = 0.03.Reduced presence of the inhibitory KIR2DL3 genotype detected in INR might provoke an imbalance in NK function, possibly leading to increased immune activation, impaired killing of latently infected cells, and higher proviral burden. These factors would hinder full immune recovery during therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2122487467,"Cranberry-derived compounds, including a fraction known as proanthocyanidins (PACs) exhibit anti-microbial, anti-infective, and anti-adhesive properties against a number of disease-causing organisms. In this study, the effect of cranberry proanthocyanidins (CPACs) on the infection of epithelial cells by two enteric bacterial pathogens, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Salmonella Typhimurium was investigated. Immunofluorescence data showed that actin pedestal formation, required for infection by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), was disrupted in the presence of CPACs. In addition, invasion of HeLa cells by Salmonella Typhimurium was significantly reduced, as verified by gentamicin protection assay and immunofluorescence. CPACs had no effect on bacterial growth, nor any detectable effect on the production of bacterial effector proteins of the type III secretion system. Furthermore, CPACs did not affect the viability of host cells. Interestingly, we found that CPACs had a potent and dose-dependent effect on the host cell cytoskeleton that was evident even in uninfected cells. CPACs inhibited the phagocytosis of inert particles by a macrophage cell line, providing further evidence that actin-mediated host cell functions are disrupted in the presence of cranberry CPACs. Thus, although CPAC treatment inhibited Salmonella invasion and EPEC pedestal formation, our results suggest that this is likely primarily because of the perturbation of the host cell cytoskeleton by CPACs rather than an effect on bacterial virulence itself. These findings have significant implications for the interpretation of experiments on the effects of CPACs on bacteria-host cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2000977915,"Rapid cellular growth and multiplication, limited replicative senescence, calibrated sensitivity to apoptosis, and a capacity to differentiate into almost any cell type are major properties that underline the self-renewal capabilities of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). We developed an integrated bioinformatics pipeline to understand the gene regulation and functions involved in maintaining such self-renewal properties of hPSCs compared to matched fibroblasts. An initial genome-wide screening of transcription factor activity using in silico binding-site and gene expression microarray data newly identified E2F as one of major candidate factors, revealing their significant regulation of the transcriptome. This is underscored by an elevated level of its transcription factor activity and expression in all tested pluripotent stem cell lines. Subsequent analysis of functional gene groups demonstrated the importance of the TFs to self-renewal in the pluripotency-coupled context; E2F directly targets the global signaling (e.g. self-renewal associated WNT and FGF pathways) and metabolic network (e.g. energy generation pathways, molecular transports and fatty acid metabolism) to promote its canonical functions that are driving the self-renewal of hPSCs. In addition, we proposed a core self-renewal module of regulatory interplay between E2F and, WNT and FGF pathways in these cells. Thus, we conclude that E2F plays a significant role in influencing the self-renewal capabilities of hPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2072256295,"SecA is a translocation ATPase that drives protein translocation. D209N SecA, a dominant-negative mutant, binds ATP but is unable to hydrolyze it. This mutant was inactive to proOmpA translocation. However, it generated a translocation intermediate of 18 kDa. Further addition of wild-type SecA caused its translocation into either mature OmpA or another intermediate of 28 kDa that can be translocated into mature by a proton motive force. The addition of excess D209N SecA during translocation caused a topology inversion of SecG. Moreover, an intermediate of SecG inversion was identified when wild-type and D209N SecA were used in the same amounts. These results indicate that multiple SecA molecules drive translocation across a single translocon with SecG inversion. Here, we propose a revised model of proOmpA translocation in which a single catalytic cycle of SecA causes translocation of 10-13 kDa with ATP binding and hydrolysis, and SecG inversion is required when the next SecA cycle begins with additional ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2076110227,"Crystals in Bacillus thuringiensis are usually formed in the mother cell compartment during sporulation and are separated from the spores after mother cell lysis. In a few strains, crystals are produced inside the exosporium and are associated with the spores after sporulation. This special phenotype, named 'spore crystal association' (SCA), typically occurs in B. thuringiensis subsp. finitimus. Our aim was to identify genes determining the SCA phenotype in B. thuringiensis subsp. finitimus strain YBT-020. Plasmid conjugation experiments indicated that the SCA phenotype in this strain was tightly linked with two large plasmids (pBMB26 and pBMB28). A shuttle bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of strain YBT-020 was constructed. Six fragments from BAC clones were screened from this library and discovered to cover the full length of pBMB26; four others were found to cover pBMB28. Using fragment complementation testing, two fragments, each of approximately 35 kb and located on pBMB26 and pBMB28, were observed to recover the SCA phenotype in an acrystalliferous mutant, B. thuringiensis strain BMB171. Furthermore, deletion analysis indicated that the crystal protein gene cry26Aa from pBMB26, along with five genes from pBMB28, were indispensable to the SCA phenotype. Gene disruption and frame-shift mutation analyses revealed that two of the five genes from pBMB28, which showed low similarity to crystal proteins, determined the location of crystals inside the exosporium. Gene disruption revealed that the three remaining genes, similar to spore germination genes, contributed to the stability of the SCA phenotype in strain YBT-020. Our results thus identified the genes determining the SCA phenotype in B. thuringiensis subsp. finitimus."
https://openalex.org/W1990244546,"Habitat fragmentation and degradation seriously threaten native animal communities. We studied the response of a small marsupial, the agile antechinus Antechinus agilis, to several environmental variables in anthropogenically fragmented Eucalyptus forest in south-east Australia. Agile antechinus were captured more in microhabitats dominated by woody debris than in other microhabitats. Relative abundances of both sexes were positively correlated with fragment core area. Male and female mass-size residuals were smaller in larger fragments. A health status indicator, haemoglobin-haematocrit residuals (HHR), did not vary as a function of any environmental variable in females, but male HHR indicated better health where sites' microhabitats were dominated by shrubs, woody debris and trees other than Eucalyptus. Females were trapped less often in edge than interior fragment habitat and their physiological stress level, indicated by the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in peripheral blood, was higher where fragments had a greater proportion of edge habitat. The latter trend was potentially due to lymphopoenia resulting from stress hormone-mediated leukocyte trafficking. Using multiple indicators of population condition and health status facilitates a comprehensive examination of the effects of anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat fragmentation and degradation, on native vertebrates. Male agile antechinus' health responded negatively to habitat degradation, whilst females responded negatively to the proportion of edge habitat. The health and condition indicators used could be employed to identify conservation strategies that would make habitat fragments less stressful for this or similar native, small mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2034230399,"Movement observation (MO) has been shown to activate the motor cortex of the observer as indicated by an increase of corticomotor excitability for muscles involved in the observed actions. Moreover, behavioral work has strongly suggested that this process occurs in a near-automatic manner. Here we further tested this proposal by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) when subjects observed how an actor lifted objects of different weights as a single or a dual task. The secondary task was either an auditory discrimination task (experiment 1) or a visual discrimination task (experiment 2). In experiment 1, we found that corticomotor excitability reflected the force requirements indicated in the observed movies (i.e. higher responses when the actor had to apply higher forces). Interestingly, this effect was found irrespective of whether MO was performed as a single or a dual task. By contrast, no such systematic modulations of corticomotor excitability were observed in experiment 2 when visual distracters were present. We conclude that interference effects might arise when MO is performed while competing visual stimuli are present. However, when a secondary task is situated in a different modality, neural responses are in line with the notion that the observers motor system responds in a near-automatic manner. This suggests that MO is a task with very low cognitive demands which might be a valuable supplement for rehabilitation training, particularly, in the acute phase after the incident or in patients suffering from attention deficits. However, it is important to keep in mind that visual distracters might interfere with the neural response in M1."
https://openalex.org/W2055711747,"CaV2.1 channels, which conduct P/Q-type Ca2+ currents, initiate synaptic transmission at most synapses in the central nervous system. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent facilitation and inactivation of these channels contributes to short-term facilitation and depression of synaptic transmission, respectively. Other calcium sensor proteins displace calmodulin (CaM) from its binding site, differentially regulate CaV2.1 channels, and contribute to the diversity of short-term synaptic plasticity. The neuronal calcium sensor protein visinin-like protein 2 (VILIP-2) inhibits inactivation and enhances facilitation of CaV2.1 channels. Here we examine the molecular determinants for differential regulation of CaV2.1 channels by VILIP-2 and CaM by construction and functional analysis of chimeras in which the functional domains of VILIP-2 are substituted in CaM. Our results show that the N-terminal domain, including its myristoylation site, the central α-helix, and the C-terminal lobe containing EF-hands 3 and 4 of VILIP-2 are sufficient to transfer its regulatory properties to CaM. This regulation by VILIP-2 requires binding to the IQ-like domain of CaV2.1 channels. Our results identify the essential molecular determinants of differential regulation of CaV2.1 channels by VILIP-2 and define the molecular code that these proteins use to control short-term synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2092367065,"Cell shape changes within epithelia require the regulation of adhesive molecules that maintain tissue integrity. How remodelling of cell contacts is achieved while tissue integrity is maintained remains a fundamental question in morphogenesis. Dorsal Closure is a good system to study the dynamics of DE-Cadherin during morphogenesis. It relies on concerted cell shape changes of two epithelial sheets: amnioserosa cell contraction and epidermal cell elongation. To investigate the modulation of DE-Cadherin we performed antibody uptake experiments in live embryos during Dorsal Closure. We found that some antibodies access certain epitopes of the extracellular domain of native DE-Cadherin only in the amnioserosa and epidermal cells attached to the amnioserosa, which has never been observed in fixed DE-Cadherin in Drosophila embryos. These differences correlate with the different cell behaviour of these regions and therefore we suggest that DE-Cadherin exists in different forms that confer different adhesive strengths. We propose this to be a widespread mechanism for the differential modulation of adhesion during morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2041523629,"In many tissues and organs, connexin proteins assemble between neighboring cells to form gap junctions. These gap junctions facilitate direct intercellular communication between adjoining cells, allowing for the transmission of both chemical and electrical signals. In rodents, gap junctions are found in differentiating myoblasts and are important for myogenesis. Although gap junctions were once believed to be absent from differentiated skeletal muscle in mammals, recent studies in teleosts revealed that differentiated muscle does express connexins and is electrically coupled, at least at the larval stage. These findings raised questions regarding the functional significance of gap junctions in differentiated muscle. Our analysis of gap junctions in muscle began with the isolation of a zebrafish motor mutant that displayed weak coiling at day 1 of development, a behavior known to be driven by slow-twitch muscle (slow muscle). We identified a missense mutation in the gene encoding Connexin 39.9. In situ hybridization found connexin 39.9 to be expressed by slow muscle. Paired muscle recordings uncovered that wild-type slow muscles are electrically coupled, whereas mutant slow muscles are not. The further examination of cellular activity revealed aberrant, arrhythmic touch-evoked Ca(2+) transients in mutant slow muscle and a reduction in the number of muscle fibers contracting in response to touch in mutants. These results indicate that Connexin 39.9 facilitates the spreading of neuronal inputs, which is irregular during motor development, beyond the muscle cells and that gap junctions play an essential role in the efficient recruitment of slow muscle fibers."
https://openalex.org/W2051732266,"The ends of eukaryotic chromosomes are protected by specialized telomere chromatin structures. Rap1 and Cdc13 are essential for the formation of functional telomere chromatin in budding yeast by binding to the double-stranded part and the single-stranded 3' overhang, respectively. We analyzed the binding properties of Saccharomyces castellii Rap1 and Cdc13 to partially single-stranded oligonucleotides, mimicking the junction of the double- and single-stranded DNA (ds-ss junction) at telomeres. We determined the optimal and the minimal DNA setup for a simultaneous binding of Rap1 and Cdc13 at the ds-ss junction. Remarkably, Rap1 is able to bind to a partially single-stranded binding site spanning the ds-ss junction. The binding over the ds-ss junction is anchored in a single double-stranded hemi-site and is stabilized by a sequence-independent interaction of Rap1 with the single-stranded 3' overhang. Thus, Rap1 is able to switch between a sequence-specific and a nonspecific binding mode of one hemi-site. At a ds-ss junction configuration where the two binding sites partially overlap, Rap1 and Cdc13 are competing for the binding. These results shed light on the end protection mechanisms and suggest that Rap1 and Cdc13 act together to ensure the protection of both the 3' and the 5' DNA ends at telomeres."
https://openalex.org/W2014387417,"A specific response of human serum neutralizing antibodies (nAb) to a conformational epitope as a result of vaccination of human subjects with the surface envelope glycoprotein (gp120) of HIV-1 has not previously been documented. Here, we used computational analysis to assess the epitope-specific responses of human subjects, which were immunized with recombinant gp120 immunogens in the VAX003 and VAX004 clinical trials. Our computational methodology—a variation of sieve analysis—compares the occurrence of specific nAb targeted conformational 3D epitopes on viruses from infected individuals who received vaccination to the occurrence of matched epitopes in the viruses infecting placebo subjects. We specifically studied seven crystallographically defined nAb targeted conformational epitopes in the V3 loop, an immunogenic region of gp120. Of the six epitopes present in the immunogens and targeted by known monoclonal neutralizing antibodies, only the one targeted by the anti-V3 nAb 2219 exhibited a significant reduction in occurrence in vaccinated subjects compared to the placebo group. This difference occurred only in the VAX003 Thailand cohort. No difference was seen between vaccinated and placebo groups for the occurrence of an epitope that was not present in the immunogen. Thus, it can be theorized that a specific 2219-like human neutralizing antibody immune response to AIDSVAX immunization occurred in the VAX003 cohort, and that this response protected subjects from a narrow subset of HIV-1 viruses circulating in Thailand in the 1990s and bearing the conformational epitope targeted by the neutralizing antibody 2219."
https://openalex.org/W1975194063,"Human visual perception is initiated through absorption of light by photoreceptors in the retina. To maintain vision, 11-cis-retinal, which is photoisomerized to all-trans-retinal, is continuously regenerated through the retinoid (visual) cycle. In the first minireview of this thematic series, entitled “Chemistry and Biology of Vision,” I describe the visual system from both chemical and structural perspectives. First, I note that a complete set of transcripts is now available for all gene products in the retina. Translated products give rise to a unique retinal architecture that includes rod and cone photoreceptor cells and the adjacent retinal pigmented epithelium. Further molecular understanding of phototransduction will require even higher resolution structures of phototransduction and retinoid cycle components obtained by x-ray and NMR techniques. This minireview also describes the chemistry of spent chromophore regeneration via the retinoid cycle. As post-mitotic neurons, photoreceptor cells regenerate chromophore and shed their outer segments throughout their life. Nothing is stated about phagocytosis of the outer segments. Finally, I summarize recent discoveries about other light-sensitive reactions governing circadian rhythm that occur in the eye as well as substantial progress in identifying novel therapies for blinding retinal diseases. Photon absorption and visual signaling occur in the outer segments, ciliary organelles of rods and cones tightly packed with stacks of membranous discs containing extremely high densities of visual pigments and other signaling proteins such as those in the associated G-protein cascade. In the second minireview, entitled “Photoreceptor Signaling: Supporting Vision across a Wide Range of Light Intensities, Vadim Y. Arshavsky and Marie E. Burns describe molecular and cellular mechanisms that allow photoreceptors to both detect low light levels, including single photons, and continue to rapidly and reliably signal changes in light intensity as illuminance increases over 10 orders of magnitude during the course of a typical day. Two topics are emphasized: the role of light-induced calcium changes in photoreceptor light adaptation and both mechanistic and functional aspects of the massive light-driven translocation of several major signaling proteins between photoreceptor outer segments and other compartments of these cells. The vitamin A derivative retinal possesses a unique chemistry that makes it an ideal visual chromophore. Retinal can reversibly bind to visual pigments via its aldehyde group, and its double bonds can undergo light-dependent cis-to-trans-isomerization. Animals have evolved pathways by which dietary chromophore precursors are absorbed in the intestine, transported in the body, taken up by the eyes, and metabolized to this chromophore. Ocular 11-cis-retinal must be continuously regenerated by the visual cycle(s) to sustain vision. In the third minireview, entitled “Metabolism of Carotenoids and Retinoids Related to Vision,” Johannes von Lintig discusses the biochemical pathways by which different animal classes metabolically process this reactive compound. Knowledge about the basic chemistry of vision should help develop strategies to combat ocular diseases associated with aberrant chromophore metabolism. In the fourth minireview, entitled “Rod and Cone Visual Pigments and Phototransduction through Pharmacological, Genetic, and Physiological Approaches,” Vladimir J. Kefalov describes how the properties of rod and cone visual pigments can be investigated in situ. Physiological recordings from individual intact rod and cone photoreceptor cells allow a quantitative analysis of their functional properties. This method combined with pharmacological and genetic tools aimed at modifying visual pigments can be used to investigate pigment properties and how they affect the function of photoreceptors. This approach has enabled observation of responses produced by thermal activation of individual cone pigment molecules expressed in transgenic rods and a direct measurement of the cone pigment thermal activation rates. In addition, pharmacologically manipulating the equilibrium between free opsin and chromophore-bound pigment demonstrated the reversibility of covalent bond formation between opsin and chromophore in cones and the resulting free opsin at equilibrium in dark-adapted cones. Expression of various pigments in transgenic rods with deficient phototransduction inactivation also enabled estimates of the life times of their physiologically active intermediates. In the fifth minireview, entitled “Loss of Daylight Vision in Retinal Degeneration: Are Oxidative Stress and Metabolic Dysregulation to Blame?,” Claudio Punzo, Wenjun Xiong, and Constance L. Cepko highlight progress made on developing therapies that prolong vision in inherited and acquired forms of retinitis pigmentosa, primarily by preventing likely mechanisms that cause photoreceptor cell death. The minireview focuses on metabolic imbalances and oxidative damage and provides experimental data on possible therapeutic interventions. Excellent animal models for retinitis pigmentosa are facilitating the development of several approaches to improve therapy. One is to use adeno-associated virus gene therapy because of promising early studies that employed this treatment for other eye diseases. Another involves the use adeno-associated virus to deliver algal or bacterial photosensitive genes to rescue phototransduction in ailing cones or endow other retinal cells with photosensitivity. A third strategy is to deliver replacement photoreceptor cells derived from stem cells. Other than classical rod and cone photoreceptors, the eye also contains a recently discovered class of photoreceptors that transmit brightness information to deep centers of the brain, including the hypothalamus and tectum. The physiology and biochemistry of this “vision” are summarized in the last minireview, entitled “Melanopsin and Mechanisms of Non-visual Ocular Photoreception,” by Timothy Sexton, Ethan Buhr, and Russell N. Van Gelder. Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells synchronize the circadian clock to external light/dark cycles and control the pupillary light response by using a different opsin pigment, melanopsin, as their photopigment. Melanopsin photoreceptive mechanisms resemble those employed by invertebrate rhabdomeric opsins more than those used by vertebrate rhodopsin or cone opsins. The melanopsin photocycle can function independently of the classical pigment epithelium-based photocycle and may rely on a bistable sequential photoisomerization mechanism for photopigment regeneration. I thank the authors for participating in this thematic minireview series and for their help with summaries of their contributions."
https://openalex.org/W2059364308,"The importance of non-coding DNAs that control transcription is ever noticeable, but the characterization and analysis of the evolution of such DNAs presents challenges not found in the analysis of coding sequences. In this study of the cis-regulatory elements of the pair rule segmentation gene fushi tarazu (ftz) I report the DNA sequences of ftz's zebra element (promoter) and a region containing the proximal enhancer from a total of 45 fly lines belonging to several populations of the species Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, D. mauritiana, D. yakuba, D. teissieri, D. orena and D. erecta. Both elements evolve at slower rate than ftz synonymous sites, thus reflecting their functional importance. The promoter evolves more slowly than the average for ftz's coding sequence while, on average, the enhancer evolves more rapidly, suggesting more functional constraint and effective purifying selection on the former. Comparative analysis of the number and nature of base substitutions failed to detect significant evidence for positive/adaptive selection in transcription-factor-binding sites. These seem to evolve at similar rates to regions not known to bind transcription factors. Although this result reflects the evolutionary flexibility of the transcription factor binding sites, it also suggests a complex and still not completely understood nature of even the characterized cis-regulatory sequences. The latter seem to contain more functional parts than those currently identified, some of which probably transcription factor binding. This study illustrates ways in which functional assignments of sequences within cis-acting sequences can be used in the search for adaptive evolution, but also highlights difficulties in how such functional assignment and analysis can be carried out."
