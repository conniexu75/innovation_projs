Degenerate primers were designed based on the sequences conserved among OAT1, OAT2, and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed using rat brain poly(A)+ RNA. The 536-amino acid protein sequence encoded by OAT3 showed 49, 39, and 36% identity to those of OAT1, OAT2, and OCT1, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that rat OAT3 mRNA is expressed in the liver, brain, kidney, and eye. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, OAT3 mediated the uptake of organic anions, such as p-aminohippurate (Km = 65 microM), ochratoxin A (Km = 0.74 microM), and estrone sulfate (Km = 2.3 microM) and a cationic compound, cimetidine. OAT3-mediated uptake of [3H]estrone sulfate was sodium-independent. para-Aminohippuric acid, estrone sulfate or ochratoxin A did not show any trans-stimulatory effect on either influx or efflux of [3H]estrone sulfate via OAT3. Organic anions such as sulfobromophthalein, probenecid, indocyanine green, bumetanide, piroxicam, furosemide, azidodeoxythymidine, 4, 4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-3,3'-disulfonic acid, and benzylpenicillin inhibited OAT3-mediated estrone sulfate uptake, while ouabain and digoxin did not. Organic cations such as tetraethylammonium, guanidine, verapamil, and quinidine did not interact with OAT3. Acidic metabolites of neurotransmitters derived from dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin inhibited the uptake of estrone sulfate via OAT3. These results suggest an important role of OAT3 in the excretion/detoxification of endogenous and exogenous organic anions, especially from the brain."

In this report we demonstrate (i) that TRANCE, like TNF-α, is made as a membrane-anchored precursor, which is released from the plasma membrane by a metalloprotease; (ii) that soluble TRANCE has potent dendritic cell survival and osteoclastogenic activity; (iii) that the metalloprotease-disintegrin TNF-α convertase (TACE) can cleave immunoprecipitated TRANCE in vitro in a fashion that mimics the cleavage observed in tissue culture cells; and (iv) that in vitro cleavage of a TRANCE ectodomain/CD8 fusion protein and of a peptide corresponding to the TRANCE cleavage site by TACE occurs at the same site that is used when TRANCE is shed from cells into the supernatant. We propose that the TRANCE ectodomain is released from cells by TACE or a related metalloprotease-disintegrin, and that this release is an important component of the function of TRANCE in bone and immune homeostasis.

Like TNF-α, TRANCE is a type II integral membrane glycoprotein of ∼45 kDa with a long extracellular stalk region followed by a receptor-binding core domain (5Wong B.R. Rho J. Arron J. Robinson E. Orlinick J. Chao M. Kalachikov S. Cayani E. Bartlett III, F.S. Frankel W.N. Lee S.Y. Choi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25190-25194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). TRANCE expression in osteoblasts and stromal cells can be induced with vitamin D3, prostaglandin E2, interleukin-1, or glucocorticoids (4Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Yamaguchi K. Kinosaki M. Mochizuki S. Tomoyasu A. Yano K. Goto M. Murakami A. Tsuda E. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Suda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This suggests that TRANCE provides an important link between the action of hormones and physiological cytokines and bone resorption. TRANCE is also expressed on activated T cells (5Wong B.R. Rho J. Arron J. Robinson E. Orlinick J. Chao M. Kalachikov S. Cayani E. Bartlett III, F.S. Frankel W.N. Lee S.Y. Choi Y. J. Biol.

Therefore TRANCE may also regulate antigen presentation during an immune response. TRANCE mediates its effects through the membrane-anchored TRANCE receptor (TRANCE-R, also referred to as RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB)), which results in activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and nuclear factor-κB (2Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 5Wong B.R.

Finally TRANCE is known to bind to a soluble receptor, termed osteoprotegerin or osteoclast inhibitory factor (OPG/OCIF), which is a member of the TNF-α receptor family (6Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Mochizuki S.I. Yano K. Fujise N. Sato Y. Goto M. Yamaguchi K. Kuriyama M. Kanno T. Murakami A. Tsuda E. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). OPG/OCIF presumably functions as a decoy receptor, since systemic overexpression or injection of OPG/OCIF causes osteopetrosis in mice (7Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M.S.

Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar), TRANCE may also be shed by TACE or a related metalloprotease. Metalloproteases have been implicated in the shedding or release of several different cell surface proteins from the plasma membrane. These proteins include various cytokines, cytokine receptors, adhesion proteins, and other proteins such as the β-amyloid precursor protein (12Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Shed membrane proteins may have very different properties compared with the membrane-anchored forms. Solubilized Fas-ligand (FasL), for example, has been shown to be a much weaker inducer of apoptosis than its transmembrane form, suggesting that shedding down-regulates the activity of FasL (13Tanaka M. Itai T. Adachi M. Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In contrast, soluble TNF-α is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, and release of TNF-α into the circulatory system contributes to its systemic effects and to pathologic conditions such as septic shock (14Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that TACE or a related metalloprotease-disintegrin is a likely candidate for the proteolytic release of the TRANCE ectodomain. Furthermore, we show that soluble TRANCE promotes dendritic cell survival and osteoclast differentiation in tissue culture.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo determine if TRANCE, like TNF-α, is shed from the plasma membrane by a protease, pulse-chase analysis was performed in COS-7 cells transiently expressing full-length TRANCE with a cytoplasmic FLAG epitope tag (FLAG-TRANCE). Immediately after the pulse labeling, two closely co-migrating bands of 46 and 48 kDa could be immunoprecipitated from the extracts with an anti-FLAG mAb (Fig. 1, lane 2). After deglycosylation of an identical sample with peptide:N-glycosidase F, only a 35-kDa band was detected, corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of membrane-anchored TRANCE (data not shown). As the duration of the chases increased from 3 to 12 h (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–5), the relative amount of 46- and 48-kDa proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG mAb decreased. Simultaneously, a 26-kDa band, which could be precipitated from the culture supernatant using a soluble TRANCE-receptor-Fc fusion protein (TR-Fc), increased in intensity (Fig. 1A, lanes 7–9). N-terminal sequence analysis (see below) confirmed that the 26-kDa protein is a soluble form of TRANCE (referred to as ecto-TRANCE hereafter). After a 12-h chase period, an additional band of 24 kDa, which most likely represents a minor shed TRANCE product, could also be seen in the supernatant (Fig. 1A, lane 9). These observations indicate that TRANCE, like TNF-α, can be released from the cell surface.To confirm that TRANCE shedding also occurs in non-transfected cells, a similar experiment was performed using the T cell hybridoma KMLS-8.3.5.1 (5Wong B.R. Rho J. Arron J. Robinson E. Orlinick J. Chao M. Kalachikov S. Cayani E. Bartlett III, F.S. Frankel W.N. Lee S.Y. Choi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25190-25194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar) from which TRANCE was originally cloned. Hybridoma cells were labeled overnight with [35S]methionine/cysteine and then stimulated for 3 h with ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to induce shedding. Immunoprecipitation with TR-Fc revealed TRANCE proteins in the media (24 and 26 kDa; Fig. 1B, lane 4) and lysate (24, 26, 46, and 48 kDa; Fig. 1B, lane 2). The observed membrane-anchored and soluble forms of TRANCE were thus similar in molecular weight to those seen in COS-7 cells expressing TRANCE. The 24- and 26-kDa proteins in the cell lysate may represent cleaved ectodomains that reside in the intracellular secretory pathway, or that are still bound to uncleaved TRANCE molecules on the cell surface.To address whether ecto-TRANCE is indeed functional, its activity was tested in osteoclast differentiation and in DC survival assays. Bone marrow precursors cultured in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor or mature bone-marrow derived DCs were incubated with 293T supernatants containing ecto-TRANCE (see Fig. 3C) at an estimated final concentration of 60 ng/ml (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 2A demonstrates that bone marrow progenitors incubated with supernatants containing ecto-TRANCE, but not supernatants from cells transfected with vector alone, induced high levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, indicating that ecto-TRANCE mediates the differentiation of osteoclasts from precursors. This activity was dependent on a TRANCE/TRANCE-R interactions because its effect could be blocked with saturating doses of a soluble receptor, TR-Fc. Fig. 2B shows that ecto-TRANCE-containing supernatants enhanced dendritic cell survival and this effect could also be inhibited by the addition of TR-Fc, indicating that the shed form of TRANCE is functionally active as a survival factor for mature DCs.Figure 3Metalloprotease-dependent release of the soluble TRANCE ectodomain from cells, and in vitrocleavage of TRANCE by TACE . A and B, COS-7 transiently transfected with FLAG-TRANCE were labeled with [35S]Cys/Met for 20 min and then incubated with ethanol/Me2SO carrier alone or stimulated with 20 ng/ml TPA for 6 h. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG mAb, and media with TR-Fc.

Immunoprecipitated full-length TRANCE on protein A beads was washed into PBS and incubated alone (lanes 2 and 4), with 2.5 μg/ml TACE (lanes 3 and 5) or 0.1 μg/ml MMP-1 (lane 6) at 37 °C for 5 h.Solid arrow, products of in vitrocleavage with TACE; open arrow, products ofin vitro cleavage with MMP-1.

Supernatants from TRANCE-transfected (293T/TRANCE) or vector-transfected (293T/Vec) 293T cells were filtered and centrifuged (100,000 × g) to remove cells and cellular membranes. A, bone marrow cells cultured in macrophage colony-stimulating factor (30 ng/ml) were incubated in medium with hCD8-TRANCE (1 μg/ml), 293T/Vec (1:50 dilution), or 293T/TRANCE (1:50 dilution) with or without purified TR-Fc (10 μg/ml) or hIgG1 (10 μg/ml). Six days later, osteoclast differentiation was assessed in bone marrow cultures by measuring tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity in the cell lysates as described under “Materials and Methods.” A representative result of the absorbance values (OD405) of three independent experiments is shown.

Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), we tested how these factors affect TRANCE shedding in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. In a pulse-chase experiment, a 15-min (data not shown) or 6-h treatment with the phorbol ester TPA increased the amount of ecto-TRANCE released into the supernatant (Fig. 3A, lower panel, lane 1) compared with constitutive shedding for 15 min (data not shown) or 6 h (Fig. 3A,upper panel, lane 1). Treatment of TPA stimulated cells with BB-94 (17Botos I. Scapozza L. Zhang D. Liotta L.A. Meyer E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2749-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), a hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitor, strongly decreased TPA-stimulated shedding of TRANCE (Fig. 3A, lower panel, lane 2), but did not detectably affect constitutive shedding (Fig. 3A, upper panel, lane 2). Serine protease inhibitors (leupeptin, STI, Pefabloc SC, and TPCK; Fig. 3A,upper and lower panels,lanes 3–6), a cysteine protease inhibitor (E-64, 10 μm; data not shown), and an aspartate protease inhibitor (pepstatin, 10 μm; data not shown) had no apparent effect on the TPA-dependent or constitutive shedding of TRANCE from COS-7 cells.Titrating the amount of BB-94 in the cell-based assay revealed significant inhibition of TRANCE shedding at 10 nm BB-94, and maximal inhibition at 100 nm (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with the K i of 11 nm that has been determined for the inhibition of TACE by BB-94 in vitro (21Roghani M. Becherer J.D. Moss M.L. Atherton R.E. ErdjumentBromage H. Arribas J. Blackburn R.K. Weskamp G. Tempst P. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3531-3540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We note that a residual component TRANCE shedding is not inhibited even by high doses of BB-94 in the TPA-treated sample. Since BB-94 also does not inhibit TRANCE shedding in unstimulated cells, other proteases besides metalloproteases may play a role in the constitutive release of TRANCE into the supernatant. A similar observation has been reported for the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) (23Buxbaum J.D. Liu K.N. Luo Y. Slack J.L. Stocking K.L. Peschon J.J. Johnson R.S. Castner B.J. Cerretti D.P. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27765-27767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts lacking TACE, the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-dependent shedding of βAPP is abolished, while a low level of constitutive shedding of βAPP, which is not inhibited by the hydroxamate-based metalloprotease inhibitor TAPI-2, is still present. Only a small percentage of total TRANCE was released, as levels of TRANCE in the cell lysate did not decrease with TPA stimulation compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3A,lane 1) or increase in BB-94-treated cells. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that TRANCE, like TNF-α, βAPP, and other shed proteins can be released in response to phorbol esters (12Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 24Mullberg J. Rauch C.T. Wolfson M.F. Castner B. Fitzner J.N. Otten-Evans C. Mohler K.M. Cosman D. Black R.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and that this release can be inhibited by a hydroxamate-based metalloprotease inhibitor.To test for a potential role of TACE in the shedding of TRANCE, metabolically labeled full-length TRANCE was immunoprecipitated and incubated in vitro with recombinant TACE. This treatment yielded polypeptides of 23 and 26 kDa (Fig. 3C,lane 3) that were not visible in the untreated sample (Fig. 3C, lane 2). A likely explanation for the relatively inefficient processing of immunoprecipitated TRANCE in Nonidet P-40 by soluble TACE is that TACE and its substrate may both need to be membrane-anchored for optimal cleavage to occur. The 26-kDa band generated in vitro by TACE co-migrated with the ecto-TRANCE isolated from the supernatant of transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 3C, lane 1), whereas the 23-kDa product did not. As a control for specificity, immunoprecipitated full-length TRANCE was also incubated with MMP-1, a member of the matrix metalloprotease family (26Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). MMP-1 produced two polypeptides of 25.5 and 24.5 kDa (Fig. 2B,lane 6). The 25.5-kDa band generated with MMP-1 did not co-migrate with ecto-TRANCE in the supernatant of TRANCE-expressing COS-7 cells (data not shown), or with TRANCE polypeptides resulting from TACE cleavage (Fig. 2B,lane 5). These in vitro cleavage results are consistent with the idea that TACE, or a protease with a similar substrate specificity, may be involved in cleaving TRANCE. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of TACE in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3D, lane 2) and 293T cells (Fig. 3D, lane 6).To compare the in vitro cleavage site for TACE in TRANCE to the N terminus of ecto-TRANCE in the supernatant of 293T-transfected cells, a soluble fusion protein of the TRANCE ectodomain with human CD8 (hCD8-TRANCE, see Fig. 4C and “Materials and Methods”) was incubated in vitro with TACE. This treatment resulted in at least three visible cleavage products (Fig. 4A, lane 2) that were not present in the TACE sample (Fig. 4A, lane 3) or in the hCD8-TRANCE sample (Fig. 4A,lane 1) incubated separately. N-terminal sequence analysis of the 26-kDa band, which co-migrated with ecto-TRANCE, revealed that it contained two polypeptide species. One of the two sequences corresponded to the N terminus of ecto-TRANCE (see below and Ref. 3Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L. Kelley M.J. Dunstan C.R. Burgess T. Elliott R. Colombero A. Elliott G. Scully S. Hsu H. Sullivan J. Hawkins N. Davy E. Capparelli C. Eli A. Qian Y.X. Kaufman S. Sarosi I. Shalhoub V. Senaldi G. Guo J. Delaney J. Boyle W.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 165-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4582) Google Scholar), whereas the other corresponded to the N terminus of human CD8 after removal of its signal sequence. N-terminal sequence analysis of the 24-kDa band (Fig. 4A, lane 2) revealed only the hCD8 N terminus (data not shown). The higher molecular weight bands seen in Fig. 4A (lane 2) presumably represent intermediate in vitrocleavage products. N-terminal sequencing of ecto-TRANCE released into the supernatant of transfected 293T cells (Fig. 4A,lane 5) confirmed the previously reported cleavage site of TRANCE, and was identical to the cleavage site generated by TACE (Fig. 4B and Ref. 3Lacey D.L.

These results demonstrate that a major in vitro cleavage site for TACE in the ectodomain of TRANCE is identical to the cleavage site of the protease that releases ecto-TRANCE from 293T cells (see diagram in Fig. 4C).Figure 4N-terminal sequence determination of soluble TRANCE secreted into the supernatant of 293T cells, and of hCD8-TRANCE cleaved in vitro by TACE . A, 3 μg of a purified hCD8-TRANCE fusion protein (lane 1), 1 μg of TACE (lane 3), or 3 μg of hCD8-TRANCE with 1 μg of TACE (lane 2) were incubated in PBS at 37 °C for 5 h prior to addition of sample loading buffer. Supernatants from 293T cells transfected with pcDNA3 (lane 4) or FLAG-TRANCE (lane 5) were incubated with TR-Fc followed by protein A.

The TRANCE peptide was cleaved in the correct position by TACE, but the specificity constant was 1000-fold lower than for the TNF-α peptide (Table I). MMP-1 did not cleave the TRANCE peptide (data not shown). This is consistent with the observation that TACE cleavage of immunoprecipitated pro-TRANCE produced a protein that co-migrated with TRANCE shed from cells, whereas cleavage with MMP-1 did not (see Fig. 2C). With respect to the peptide cleavage specificity of metalloprotease-disintegrins, we note that both ADAM10 (KUZ/MADM) and TACE cleave a TNF-α peptide at the physiological position (9Black R.

The correct cleavage of the TRANCE peptide by TACE therefore suggests that TACE, or a metalloprotease with a similar substrate specificity, cleaves TRANCE in cells. The difference in specificity constants of TACE for the TRANCE and TNF-α peptides (1000-fold) is similar to the reported difference in peptide cleavage efficiency of TACE for TNF-α and the putative TACE substrate L-selectin (2250-fold) (11Peschon J.J.

https://openalex.org/W1978202313,"One of the primary points of regulation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) activity is control of its conversion from the latent precursor to the biologically active form. We have identified thrombospondin-1 as a major physiological regulator of latent TGF-β activation. Activation is dependent on the interaction of a specific sequence in thrombospondin-1 (K412RFK415) with the latent TGF-β complex. Platelet thrombospon-din-1 has TGF-β activity and immunoreactive mature TGF-β associated with it. We now report that the latency-associated peptide (LAP) of the latent TGF-β complex also interacts with thrombospondin-1 as part of a biologically active complex. Thrombospondin·LAP complex formation involves the activation sequence of thrombospondin-1 (KRFK) and a sequence (LSKL) near the amino terminus of LAP that is conserved in TGF-β1–5. The interactions of LAP with thrombospondin-1 through the LSKL and KRFK sequences are important for thrombospondin-mediated activation of latent TGF-β since LSKL peptides can competitively inhibit latent TGF-β activation by thrombospondin or KRFK-containing peptides. In addition, the association of LAP with thrombospondin-1 may function to prevent the re-formation of an inactive LAP·TGF-β complex since thrombospondin-bound LAP no longer confers latency on active TGF-β. The mechanism of TGF-β activation by thrombospondin-1 appears to be conserved among TGF-β isoforms as latent TGF-β2 can also be activated by thrombospondin-1 or KRFK peptides in a manner that is sensitive to inhibition by LSKL peptides.

There are five isoforms of TGF-β, three of which are expressed in mammals. TGF-β is synthesized by virtually all cell types in a latent form that must be activated in order to be recognized by cell-surface receptors and to trigger biological responses (1Massague J. Annu.

To better understand the mechanism of thrombospondin-mediated activation of latent TGF-β, we sought to determine the region of the latent TGF-β complex recognized by the TGF-β-activating sequence KRFK in thrombospondin.

This latent complex is the product of a single gene. Prior to secretion, LAP is enzymatically cleaved from the active peptide (16Gentry L.E. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. Marquardt H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and the integrity and latency of the secreted complex are presumably maintained via electrostatic interactions (17Brown P.D. Wakefield L.M. Levison A.D. Sporn M.B. Growth Factors. 1990; 3: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Although latent TGF-β can also exist as a large complex in which small latent TGF-β is associated with a latent TGF-β-binding protein, the presence of the latent TGF-β-binding protein is neither necessary nor sufficient to confer latency on the active peptide (18Miyazono K. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6407-6415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Flanders K.C. Sporn M.B. J. Biol.

On the other hand, latency is dependent on the presence of LAP, and modification of the cysteine residues responsible for LAP dimerization results in altered TGF-β secretion (21Sha X. Yang L. Gentry L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Miller D.M. Ogawa Y. Iwata K.K. ten Dijke P. Purchio A.F. Soloff M.S. Gentry L.E. Mol.

J. 1996; 313: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting that the tertiary structure of LAP is important for the formation of the latent TGF-β complex. Gentry and co-workers (21Sha X. Yang L. Gentry L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed through mutagenesis studies that amino acids 40–80 in LAP are important for maintenance of the latency of the complex. In a previous study, we observed that antibodies raised against a sequence present in the amino terminus of LAP (residues 81–94) inhibited activation of latent TGF-β by thrombospondin (13Schultz-Cherry S. Ribeiro S.M.F. Gentry L. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26775-26782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led us to propose that thrombospondin-mediated activation of latent TGF-β involves interactions between the thrombospondin activation sequence (KRFK) and a site present in the amino-terminal region of LAP. We now show that LAP is complexed with thrombospondin-1 in association with biologically active TGF-β and that the thrombospondin-1 sequence KRFK binds LAP through interactions that involve a specific sequence at the amino terminus of β1-LAP (L54SKL57). The KRFK sequence in thrombospondin-1 and the LSKL sequence in LAP are apparently critical for activation of latent TGF-β by thrombospondin-1 since soluble LSKL peptides can competitively block activation of latent TGF-β by either thrombospondin-1 or KRFK-containing peptides. LAP binding to thrombospondin may play a role in preventing re-formation of the latent complex. In addition, the mechanism of thrombospondin-mediated activation of latent TGF-β appears to be conserved in the mammalian isoforms of TGF-β since thrombospondin-1 can also activate latent TGF-β2 in an LSKL-sensitive manner. Thrombospondin-1, native or strip- ped of TGF-β activity, was purified as described (11Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Schultz-Cherry S. Hook M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) from human platelets obtained from the Birmingham American Red Cross. Thrombospondin purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. The depletion of TGF-β activity in preparations of stripped thrombospondin was confirmed in the NRK colony formation assay (11Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Schultz-Cherry S. Hook M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The peptides used in this work were synthesized by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center/Peptide Synthesis and Analysis shared facility. Initial peptides and peptide 246 used in this study were a gift from Dr. David Roberts (NCI, National Institutes of Health). Recombinant latent TGF-β2 was a generous gift from Dr. Patricia Segarini and Celtrix Corp. (Palo Alto, CA), and was purified as described (24Lioubin M.N. Madisen L. Marquardt H. Roth R. Kovacina K.S. Purchio A.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recombinant latent TGF-β1 was a gift from Jane Ranchelis (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Seattle, WA). Monoclonal antibody 133 against stripped thrombospondin-1 was developed in a joint effort between our laboratory and the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hybridoma core facility (12Schultz-Cherry S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Recombinant human β1-LAP (catalogue no. 246-LP/CF) and mouse monoclonal and goat polyclonal anti-LAP antibodies (catalogue no. AB-246-NA) were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells were isolated in our laboratory from aortas obtained at a local abattoir and were characterized by Dil-AcLDL uptake and staining for factor VIII antigen, according to established protocols. Stocks were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. Conditioned media experiments were performed in the presence of reduced serum concentrations as described in the figure legends. NRK-49F cells (CRL-1570) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and were kept in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. All cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma. Equimolar concentrations of stripped thrombospondin-1 or peptides (11 nm) were incubated with recombinant latent TGF-β (2 nm) in a final volume of 0.5 ml of PBS for 1 h at 37 °C (13Schultz-Cherry S. Ribeiro S.M.F. Gentry L. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26775-26782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, stripped thrombospondin-1 or peptides were incubated with BAE cell-conditioned media as described (11Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Schultz-Cherry S. Hook M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A positive control for latent TGF-β activation consisted of heat treatment of the latent complex at 80 °C for 5 min. TGF-β activity was assayed based on its ability to stimulate growth of NRK fibroblasts in suspension as described (11Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Schultz-Cherry S. Hook M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In brief, 1–3 × 103NRK cells were plated in a 0.3% agar suspension in the presence of epidermal growth factor (2.5 ng/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) and in the presence or absence of TGF-β and incubated at 37 °C for 7 days. At the end of this incubation period, colonies containing 8–10 cells (i.e. colonies larger than 62 μm) were counted. Active TGF-β (2.5 ng/ml) was used as a positive control. Experiments were performed in triplicate at least twice. Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (% acrylamide indicated in the figure legends) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (2 h, 100 V). Nonspecific protein-binding sites present in the membranes were blocked by incubation with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Tris-buffered saline/Tween). Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline/Tween (antibody 133 used at 0.05 μg/ml, goat polyclonal anti-LAP at 1 μg/ml, and other antibodies and dilutions specified in the figure legends) followed by extensive washes in Tris-buffered saline/Tween with 0.1% Tween 20. After washing, membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG used at 0.1 μg/ml for 1 h at room temperature, peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG at 0.08 μg/ml, and dilutions and incubation times for other antibodies as indicated in the figure legends) and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Multiple exposures were obtained to assure linearity of the response. Peptide KRFKQDGGC or TRIRQDGGC (5 mg/1 ml in 50 mm Tris and 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.5) was coupled to Sulfolink (1 ml; Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions and equilibrated in PBS. 2.4 μmol of peptide KRFKQDGGC or 3.3 μmol of peptide TRIRQDGGC were coupled to the Sulfolink resin. Recombinant human β1-LAP (10 μg/0.5 ml of PBS, 0.28 nmol) was loaded and incubated with the affinity matrix (bed volume = 1 ml) for 20 min at room temperature and then circulated through the column five times. Prior to elution, the column was washed with 25 ml of PBS. Proteins bound to the affinity matrix were then eluted stepwise, first with 4 ml of peptide SLLK, followed by 10 ml of peptide LSKL and, for the TRIR affinity column, peptide TRIR (all peptides at 86 μm, a 150-fold molar excess to LAP). Fraction size was 0.25 ml, and all LAP protein eluted between fractions 3 and 5 (0.75–1.25 ml). Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-LAP antibodies. Stripped thrombospondin (11 nm) and recombinant human β1-LAP (28 nm) were incubated together in a total volume of 0.5 ml of PBS in the presence or absence of peptide KRFK, TRIR, or KRAK, (11 μm) or peptide LSKL, SLLK, or RGQILSKLRL (28 μm). Peptides were used at a 1000-fold molar excess to either TSP or LAP, respectively. When peptides were present, each protein was preincubated with the appropriate inhibitory peptide for 30 min at 4 °C (TSP preincubated with LSKL and LAP preincubated with KRFK). The second protein was then added to the peptide/protein mixture and incubated together for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with goat polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant human LAP (0.5 μg of antibody/0.5 ml of sample), followed by a 30-min incubation with protein G-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Alternatively, the protein mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with GammaBind G-Sepharose (catalogue no. 17-0885-01, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) conjugated with monoclonal antibody 133 in wash buffer (PBS containing 1 g/liter ovalbumin and 5 ml/liter Tween 20; 10 μg of antibody/0.5 ml of matrix). Immune complexes were washed with wash buffer, resuspended in reducing Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal antibody 133 against thrombospondin or with goat polyclonal anti-LAP antibodies. For dose-response inhibition assays, LAP was preincubated with 0.11–110 μm peptide KRFK, whereas thrombospondin was incubated with 0.28–280 μm peptide LSKL. For immunoprecipitation of proteins from media conditioned by BAE cells, ∼3 × 106 cells were incubated for 24 h in 3 ml of DMEM containing insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite media supplement (Sigma) at the concentration recommended by the manufacturer. Conditioned media were harvested and immediately incubated with goat polyclonal antibodies against recombinant human LAP (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose 4B beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed and analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-TSP antibodies as described above. To deplete native thrombospondin of LAP, 20 μg of thrombospondin in 25 μl of PBS were incubated three times with 25 μl of goat anti-LAP antibodies coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (coupling per manufacturer's instructions) for 20 min each time. Following each incubation, samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was transferred to another tube containing antibodies coupled to resin. Prior to the first incubation and following the last incubation, protein concentration in the sample was measured by A 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 1.27. Sample volumes to be tested for TGF-β activity and Western-blotted for LAP were adjusted so that the same amount of protein (6.25 μg) was used in all cases. Assay conditions were those previously described as ideal for re-formation of the latent TGF-β complex (22Miller D.M. Ogawa Y. Iwata K.K. ten Dijke P. Purchio A.F. Soloff M.S. Gentry L.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, thrombospondin (9 μg; amount chosen based on our previous studies of latent TGF-β activation by thrombospondin) was incubated with LAP (28 ng) in 100 μl of serum-free DMEM for 1 h at room temperature. TGF-β (2 ng in 2 μl) was then added to the appropriate samples, followed by an additional incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Samples to which no TGF-β was added, samples containing TGF-β alone, and samples in which LAP and thrombospondin were not incubated together prior to addition of TGF-β were incubated at the same temperature for the same extent of time to minimize variations due to loss of protein to the tube or loss of TGF-β activity over time. Immediately following the second incubation, samples were tested for TGF-β activity as described above. The search for a sequence in LAP complementary to the thrombospondin-1 sequence KRFK was performed through computer analysis utilizing a computer program designed to identify patterns of inverted hydropathy (25Maier C.C. Moseley H.N.B. Zhou S.-R. Whitaker J.N. Blalock J.E. Immunomethods. 1994; 5: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The parameter settings used were as follows: 1) search a window size of five amino acids (hits are searched for in a window of five residues, sliding the window down the sequence one amino acid at a time); 2) average chain complementarity set at 1.2 (this value represents the average of the differences in the hydropathic scores of aligned amino acids for the window size selected; the closer to 0, the better the complementarity); and 3) the cutoff point for considering if two amino acids are opposite set to 2.0 (the absolute value of the two aligned residues added together is denoted as the cutoff). Previous results indicated that an antibody raised against the amino terminus of LAP could block thrombospondin-mediated activation of latent TGF-β (13Schultz-Cherry S. Ribeiro S.M.F. Gentry L. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26775-26782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a possible interaction of thrombospondin with the LAP portion of the latent complex. During the course of our studies, Yang et al. (45Yang Y. Dignam J.D. Gentry L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11923-11932Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported that recombinant dimeric LAP binds to immobilized thrombospondin. Since the presence of LAP is both necessary and sufficient to confer latency on TGF-β and since TGF-β associated with thrombospondin-1 is in its active state, one would predict that LAP would not be present in biologically active thrombospondin-1·TGF-β complexes. However, human platelet thrombospondin-1 that has TGF-β bioactivity (11Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Schultz-Cherry S. Hook M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) also contains detectable LAP, suggesting that LAP may potentially be associated with thrombospondin-1·TGF-β complexes (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, LAP isolated by immunoprecipitation from media conditioned by BAE cells in culture co-purifies with thrombospondin-1, as detected by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). These observations show that in biological fluids, thrombospondin and LAP can exist in complexes. Furthermore, these data suggest the possibility that active TGF-β can form a ternary complex with thrombospondin-1 and LAP. Since previous observations showed that thrombospondin-1 contains associated TGF-β activity, we hypothesized that LAP, thrombospondin, and TGF-β may form ternary complexes that maintain bioactivity. To investigate this hypothesis, it was determined whether removal of thrombospondin molecules that had associated LAP resulted in depletion of TGF-β activity present in the thrombospondin-1 preparation. Thrombospondin-associated TGF-β activity was measured prior to and following immunodepletion of LAP-associated thrombospondin-1 with anti-LAP antibodies coupled to Sepharose beads. Equal concentrations of protein in both the starting and immunodepleted materials were evaluated for TGF-β activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, thrombospondin-1 that had been depleted of LAP by immunoprecipitation with anti-LAP antibodies was correspondingly depleted of TGF-β activity. Immunodepletion of LAP from the thrombospondin-1 samples was confirmed by our inability to detect LAP on Western blots of treated samples (Fig. 2A). To further investigate the hypothesis that ternary complexes containing thrombospondin, TGF-β, and LAP retain TGF-β activity, these proteins were incubated under conditions that allow them to form binary and/or ternary complexes, and the resulting TGF-β activity was measured (Fig. 2B). As expected, incubation of active TGF-β with LAP resulted in inactivation of the growth factor, indicating that the latent TGF-β complex was re-formed under these conditions. However, when TGF-β was incubated with preformed complexes of thrombospondin and LAP (Fig. 2B), LAP failed to inactivate TGF-β. These observations show that LAP complexes with thrombospondin in biological fluids and that active TGF-β, thrombospondin, and LAP can form ternary complexes. These data also show that interactions of thrombospondin with LAP alter the ability of this precursor portion of TGF-β to confer latency on active TGF-β. Polyclonal antibodies raised against a peptide from the LAP amino terminus (amino acids 81–94) inhibit latent TGF-β activation by thrombospondin-1 (13Schultz-Cherry S. Ribeiro S.M.F. Gentry L. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26775-26782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation and the presence of LAP in biologically active thrombospondin-1·TGF-β complexes suggest that the thrombospondin-1 sequence (KRFK) responsible for activation of latent TGF-β might interact with LAP. To test this hypothesis, we chose an approach based on co-immunoprecipitation. When thrombospondin-1 and LAP were incubated together for 1 h at room temperature, they formed complexes that were immunoprecipitated by both polyclonal antibodies against LAP (Fig. 3, A and B,third lanes) and monoclonal antibodies against thrombospondin (Fig. 3, C and D, third lanes). This association between thrombospondin and LAP was competitively inhibited by preincubation of LAP with the thrombospondin-derived peptide KRFK. Partial inhibition occurred when the peptide was present at a 10–100-fold molar excess relative to the thrombospondin concentration, whereas complete inhibition was observed when the peptide was present at a 1000-fold molar excess (Fig. 3,A and C, fourth through seventh lanes). These data suggest a role for the thrombospondin-1 activation sequence KRFK in LAP binding. The inability of the related sequence KRAK, which does not activate latent TGF-β (15Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7304-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), to inhibit complex formation between the two proteins (Fig. 3, B and D, sixth lane) provides evidence that this interaction between the thrombospondin-1 sequence KRFK and LAP is specific. Furthermore, data from this experiment also suggest that the interaction between the KRFK sequence and LAP is relevant for the ability of thrombospondin to activate latent TGF-β since the inactive KRFK homologue in thrombospondin-2 (TRIR) had no inhibitory effect on complex formation between thrombospondin-1 and LAP (Fig. 3, B and D,fifth lanes). These data show that thrombospondin-1 binds to the LAP portion of the latent TGF-β molecule. This binding is apparently mediated by the TGF-β-activating sequence KRFK in thrombospondin-1 and may be part of the mechanism by which thrombospondin-1 activates latent TGF-β. To identify the sequence on LAP responsible for binding the thrombospondin-1 sequence KRFK, we used the molecular recognition theory as a strategy to identify sequences in LAP complementary to the KRFK sequence in thrombospondin-1 that could potentially form a binding site (25Maier C.C.

https://openalex.org/W2154584898,"Nonenzymatic cytosolic fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are abundantly expressed in many animal tissues with high rates of fatty acid metabolism. No physiological role has been demonstrated for any FABP, although these proteins have been implicated in transport of free long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) and protection against LCFA toxicity. We report here that mice lacking heart-type FABP (H-FABP) exhibit a severe defect of peripheral (nonhepatic, non-fat) LCFA utilization. In these mice, the heart is unable to efficiently take up plasma LCFAs, which are normally its main fuel, and switches to glucose usage. Altered plasma levels of LCFAs, glucose, lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate are consistent with depressed peripheral LCFA utilization, intensified carbohydrate usage, and increased hepatic LCFA oxidation; these changes are most pronounced under conditions favoring LCFA oxidation. H-FABP deficiency is only incompletely compensated, however, causing acute exercise intolerance and, at old age, a localized cardiac hypertrophy. These data establish a requirement for H-FABP in cardiac intracellular lipid transport and fuel selection and a major role in metabolic homeostasis. This new animal model should be particularly useful for investigating the significance of peripheral LCFA utilization for heart function, insulin sensitivity, and blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W1969120382,"The dioxin (aryl hydrocarbon) receptor is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that induces expression of a number of genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes. In the absence of ligand the dioxin receptor is present in the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell associated with the molecular chaperone hsp90, which has been implicated in regulating the correct folding of the ligand binding domain of the receptor. In this study we have examined a potential role of the hsp90-associated p23 protein in the activation process of the dioxin receptor to a DNA binding form. In an <i>in vitro</i> model we show that addition of ligand alone to the dioxin receptor fails to induce release of hsp90 from the dioxin receptor. In the presence of ligand, this release was, however, induced upon addition of purified preparations of Arnt. Interestingly, p23 was also found to be associated with the nonactivated form of the dioxin receptor. Following fractionation on sucrose gradients p23 was dissociated from the receptor-hsp90 complex generating a receptor form, which showed ligand-independent release of hsp90 by Arnt and, consequently, ligand-independent activation of the DNA binding activity of the dioxin receptor. Ligand dependence was reconstituted in the presence of molybdate, a transition metal ion known to stabilize the interaction between the molecular chaperone hsp90 and p23. Taken together these experiments suggest a role of p23 in modulating ligand responsiveness in the activation process of the dioxin receptor."

The Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL suppress programmed cell death, whereas Bax promotes programmed cell death. Activated caspase-1 (interleukin-1beta converting enzyme) and caspase-3 (Yama/Apopain/Cpp32) cleave proteins that are important in maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and DNA repair, and activate deoxyribonucleases, producing cell death with morphological features of apoptosis. To address the question of whether these Bcl-2 and caspase family members participate in the process of delayed neuronal death in humans, we examined brain tissue samples removed from adult patients during surgical decompression for intracranial hypertension in the acute phase after traumatic brain injury (n=8) and compared these samples to brain tissue obtained at autopsy from non-trauma patients (n=6). An increase in Bcl-2 but not Bcl-xL or Bax, cleavage of caspase-1, up-regulation and cleavage of caspase-3, and evidence for DNA fragmentation with both apoptotic and necrotic morphologies were found in tissue from traumatic brain injury patients compared with controls. These findings are the first to demonstrate that programmed cell death occurs in human brain after acute injury, and identify potential pharmacological and molecular targets for the treatment of human head injury."

In endothelial cells this mechanism involves phosphorylation of the RelA subunit of NF-κB through a pathway involving activation of protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) and p21<sup>ras</sup>. We show that transcriptional activity of RelA is dependent on phosphorylation of the N-terminal Rel homology domain but not the C-terminal transactivation domain. Inhibition of phosphorylation by dominant negative mutants of PKCζ or p21<sup>ras</sup> results in loss of RelA transcriptional activity without interfering with DNA binding.

However, the DNA-binding protein(s) involved in BMP signaling has not been identified. Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, we found that Smad1 interacts with Hoxc-8, a homeodomain transcription factor.

Transient transfection studies showed that native osteopontin promoter activity was elevated upon BMP stimulation. Consistent with the gel shift assay, overexpression of Hoxc-8 abolished the BMP stimulation. When a wild type or mutant Hoxc-8 binding element was linked to an SV40 promoter-driven reporter gene, the wild type but not the mutant Hoxc-8 binding site responded to BMP stimulation.

However, little is known about the downstream DNA-binding protein(s) beyond Smad1 in the BMP signal transduction machinery. It has been suggested that homeobox genes play a role in downstream events in BMP signaling (13Tang S.J. Hoodless P.A. Lu Z. Breitman M.L. Mclnnes R.R. Wrana J.L. Buchwald M.

In vertebrates, there are 39Hox transcription factor genes organized into four separated chromosome clusters, which play critical roles in the patterning of vertebrate embryonic development (15Sharkey M. Graba Y. Scott M.P. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 145-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These 39 genes are subdivided into 13 paralogous groups on the basis of duplication of an ancestral homeobox cluster during evolution, sequence similarity, and position within the cluster (16Maconochie M. Nonchev S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 529-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Each paralog group has been demonstrated to be responsible for the morphogenesis of a particular embryonic domain or structure (15Sharkey M. Graba Y. Scott M.P. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 145-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Hoxc-8, as one of the three members of paralog VIII, is predominantly expressed at a high level in the limbs, backbone, and spinal cord in early mouse embryos (17Simeone A. Mavilio F. Acampora D.

Null mutant mice showed that Hoxc-8 is expressed in the neuron, chondrocyte, fetal liver, and adult bone marrow (19Shimamoto T. Tang Y. Naot Y. Nardi M. Brulet P. Bieberich C.J. Takeshita K. J. Exp.

Kappen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The other two members in the Hox VIII group are Hoxb-8 and Hoxd-8. Hoxb-8 has been shown to activate the Sonic hedgehog gene, an essential mediator in forelimb development (22Charite J. de Graaff W. Shen S. Deschamps J.

Despite the fact that homeobox genes are DNA-binding proteins, little has been learned about their natural DNA response elements and role in transcription (25Maconochie M. Nonchev S. Morrison A. Krumlauf R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 529-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the current study, we report that Smad1 interacts with Hoxc-8, and this interaction specifically activates the osteopontin gene transcription in response to BMP stimulation. Our data suggest that Hoxc-8 functions as a transcription repressor and that the interaction of Smad1 with Hoxc-8 dislodges Hoxc-8 binding from its element resulting in initiation of gene transcription. A full-length Smad1 coding sequence from pBluescript-Smad1(9) was cloned intoSalI/PstI sites of pGBT9 (CLONTECH) to generate the pGBT9/Smad1 bait plasmid. The human U2 OS osteoblast-like pACT2 cDNA library was screened according to the manufacturer's instruction (CLONTECH). To confirm the interaction between Hoxc-8 and Smad1, a full-length mouse Hoxc-8 cDNA (18Le Mouellic H. Condamine H. Brulet P. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pACT2 vector (CLONTECH) between theXhoI and EcoRI sites. The pACT/Hoxc-8 was co-transformed with pBGT9/Smad1 into Y190, and the colonies were assayed for the production of β-galactosidase using both filter lift and liquid assays. GST fusion constructs of GST-Smad1 and -Smad3 were generated by restriction digest of pGBT-Smad1 (SalI/HindIII) and pCMV5-Smad3 (9Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R.

GST-Smad2 and -Smad4 were digested with EcoRI/SalI from pCMV5-Smad2 and pCMV5-Smad4 (9Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R.

The GST-Hoxc-8 and GST-Hoxa-9 (26Catron K.M. Wang H. Hu G. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Mech.

The GST-Msx-1 and -Msx-2 expression plasmids (27Izon D.J. Rozenfeld S. Fong S.T. Komuves L. Largman C. Lawrence HJ. Blood. 1998; 92: 383-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. C. Abate-Shen (Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, Piscataway, NJ). The GST constructs described above were transformed into BL21. The expression and purification of the fusion proteins were performed as described (28Sterner J.M. Murata Y. Kim H.G. Kennett S.B. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol.

[35S]Methionine-labeled Hoxc-8 protein was synthesized using the TNT-coupled transcription and translation system (Promega) with linearized pBluescript-Hoxc-8 plasmid according to the manufacturer's instruction. The production of labeled protein was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An equivalent amount (1 μg) of purified GST or GST-Smad1 fusion protein was preincubated with 35S-labeled Hoxc-8 protein (5 μl) for 30 min on ice. Following the addition of GST-agarose, the samples were incubated for another 30 min at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed four times in a phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100 solution, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× SDS buffer for 5 min before loading onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. HA-tagged Hoxc-8 was subcloned from pACT2/Hoxc-8 into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) at BglII/BamHI and XhoI. Expression vectors for FLAG-tagged Smad1 and Smad4 were provided by Dr. Rik Derynck (University of California, San Francisco, CA). Expression plasmids for constitutively active BMP type IA (ALK3) and IB receptors (ALK6) (7Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 85: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (626) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. Jeffrey L. Wrana (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). COS-1 cells were transfected with expression constructs as indicated in Fig. 2B using Tfx-50 according to the manufacturer's description (Promega). Cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antiserum (Babco) and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG M2 (Eastman Kodak) as described (7Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 85: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Gel shift assays were performed as described previously (29Cao X. Ross F.P. Zhang L. MacDonald P.N. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27371-27380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, DNA fragments OPN-1, OPN-2, and OPN-3 were generated by polymerase chain reaction using primers specific for the osteopontin promoter. The double-stranded oligomers were created by annealing the pairs of synthetic oliogonucleotides (only top strands are shown) as follows: 5′-CATGACCCCAATTAGTCCTGGCAGCA-3′ (probe-M); 5′-CCTTTCCTTATGGATCCCTG-3′ (OPN-4); 5′-GGTAGTTAATGACATCGTTCATCAG-3′(OPN-5); 5′-GGTAGTGCCGGACATCGTTCATCAG-3′(mOPN-5); and 5′-GACATCGTTCATCAGTAATGCTTTG-3′ (OPN-6). Mutated nucleotides in mOPN-5 are bolded. These DNA fragments were radiolabeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The osteopontin promoter from region −266 to −1 relative to the transcription start site was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from CH10T1/2 cell genomic DNA and cloned into SmaI and XhoI sites of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega) to generate a luciferase reporter construct (OPN-266). Hox-pGL3 reporter bearing the Hoxc-8 binding site (−290 to −166) was constructed using the same strategy but was put into the pGL3-control vector (Promega). The Hox recognition core TAAT was replaced with GCCG in Hox-pGL3 by polymerase chain reaction to create mutant Hox-pGL3 (mHox-pGL3). C3H10T1/2 cells (2.5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) were transfected using Tfx-50 with 0.5 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid (OPN-266, Hox-pGL3, or mHox-pGL3) and different expression plasmids as indicated. Total DNA was kept constant by the addition of pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid. Luciferase activities were assayed 48 h post-transfection using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's direction. Values were normalized with the Renilla luciferase activity expressed from pRL-SV40 reporter plasmid. Luciferase values shown in the figures are representative of transfection experiments performed in triplicate in at least three independent experiments. To investigate the transcription mechanism in BMP-induced gene activation, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to identify transcription factors that interact with Smad1. An intact Smad1 cDNA fused with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain was used as a bait plasmid to screen a human U-2 OS osteoblast-like cell cDNA library constructed in the pACT2 plasmid. After two rounds of screening, we obtained 25 positive clones. DNA sequence analysis identified one clone as Hoxc-8 and two clones as Smad4. Because our objective is to identify downstream transcription factors in the BMP signaling pathway and Hoxc-8 is a homeodomain DNA-binding protein, we chose the Hoxc-8 cDNA clone for further study. Cloning of Smad4 provided a positive control for the two-hybrid library screening because the interaction between Smad1 and Smad4 is known. The other 22 clones were not characterized. The initial Hoxc-8 cDNA clone (Fig. 1B, clone 19) encodes amino acids 68–237 of a 242-amino acid Hoxc-8 protein. Fig. 1Ashows the growth properties of the two-hybrid clones, suggesting that there is an interaction between Smad1 and Hoxc-8 in vivo. The yeast bearing both Smad1 and Hoxc-8 plasmids grew on medium deficient in Trp, Leu, and His. The interaction between Hoxc-8 and Smad1 was further confirmed with a β-galactosidase filter lift assay (data not shown) and quantified by a liquid β-galactosidase assay (Fig. 1B). When the full length of Hoxc-8 fused with the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain was tested in the two-hybrid system, it showed an interaction similar to clone 19. The assays of both the empty prey vector (pACT2) with Smad1 in the bait plasmid and the empty bait vector (pGBT9) with full-length Hoxc-8 in the prey vector showed very little activity. Compared with the interaction between Smad1 and Smad4, the interaction of Smad1 with Hoxc-8 is weaker in the yeast two-hybrid β-galactosidase assay (Fig. 1B). The interaction between Smad1 and Hoxc-8 was examined in an in vitro pull-down experiment using [35S]methionine-labeled Hoxc-8 and purified GST-Smad1 or GST alone. As shown in Fig. 2A, Hoxc-8 was precipitated with the purified GST-Smad1 fusion protein (lane 3) but not with GST alone (lane2), demonstrating a direct interaction between the two proteins in vitro. BMP-2 stimulates phosphorylation of Smad1, and phosphorylated Smad1 in turn binds to Smad4 and takes the complex into the nucleus. It is of interest whether Smad1, Smad4, or the complex of Smad1 and Smad4 also interacts with Hoxc-8 in cells. COS-1 cells were transiently co-transfected with expression plasmids for FLAG-Smad1, FLAG-Smad4, HA-Hoxc-8, and/or constitutively active BMP type IA receptor ALK3 (Q233D). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody. Fig. 2Bdemonstrates that Smad1 (lane 3), Smad4 (lane 5) or both (lane 7) were co-immunoprecipitated with HA-Hoxc-8 in cells. Co-transfection of ALK3 (Q233D) enhanced the interaction of Smad1 (lane 4) or Smad4 (lane 6) with Hoxc-8. However, ALK3 (Q233D) did not significantly enhance the interaction of Smad1 and Smad4 complex with Hoxc-8 (lane 8). These results show both Smad1 and Smad4 interact with Hoxc-8 in COS-1 cells with or without BMP stimulation, indicating that the phosphorylation of Smad1 is not required for its interaction with Hoxc-8. If this is the case, the BMP-dependent regulation of the interaction is inherent in the intracellular localization of the proteins. Hox proteins are homeodomain transcription factors localized in the nucleus (30Zhang N. Gong Z.Z. Minden M. Lu M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3265-3270PubMed Google Scholar), whereas both Smad1 and Smad4 are cytoplasmic (5Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). It is likely that the interaction occurs only when Smad1 or the complex translocates to nucleus upon its phosphorylation induced by BMP receptors. To examine the effect of the interaction between Hoxc-8 and Smad1 on Hoxc-8 DNA binding activity, we turned our attention to BMP-2 inducible genes. Putative Hox binding sites that have served as markers for osteogenic differentiation were found in four BMP-2 inducible genes, including bone sialoprotein, osteopontin, osteonectin, and osteocalcin (3Ahrens M. Ankenbauer T. Schroder D. Hollnagel A. Mayer H. Gross G. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 31Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 424-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). These genes have served as markers for osteoblast differentiation. The osteopontin promoter was examined for this purpose because its mRNA expression is rapidly induced in response to BMP-2 treatment in C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cell (3Ahrens M. Ankenbauer T. Schroder D. Hollnagel A. Mayer H. Gross G. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Five putative Hox binding sites with a core sequence of Tt/aAT (32Craig A.M. Denhardt D.T. Gene. 1991; 100: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) were identified within the first 382 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region in the osteopontin gene (Fig. 3A). When a 212-base pair DNA fragment from −382 to −170 (OPN-1 in Fig. 3A) containing all five putative Hox sites was used for a gel shift assay with purified GST-Hoxc-8 protein, one shifted band (Fig. 3B,lane 3) was observed. This band was not present inlane 1, containing probe only, or in lane 2, containing probe with GST (Fig. 3B). This result indicates that there is only one Hoxc-8 binding site in this osteopontin promoter fragment. Further gel shift assays with shorter probes (OPN-2 and OPN-3 in Fig. 3A) indicated that OPN-2 contains this Hoxc-8 binding element (Fig. 3B, lane 6). When three single putative Hox binding probes (OPN-4, -5, and -6, Fig. 3A) were used, Hoxc-8 only bound to OPN-5, located at −206 to −180 (Fig. 3C, lane 8). Neither GST alone nor GST-Smad1 fusion protein could bind to any of the probes used in this series of gel shift assays (Fig. 3, B, lanes 2,5, and 8, and C, lanes 2,3, 6, 7, 10, and 11). When the TAAT core sequence of Hoxc-8 binding site in OPN-5 was mutated to GCCG (mOPN-5), Hoxc-8 binding was abolished (Fig. 3C, lane 15). The specificity of the Hoxc-8 binding to the DNA was determined by a gel shift competition assay. Unlabeled Hoxc-8 DNA binding element inhibited the shifted band in a concentration dependent manner (Fig. 3D, lanes 3–5) in which a 100-fold excess of the specific cold probe eliminated the Hoxc-8 binding, whereas a 100-fold excess of the Msx-2 DNA binding element (33Towler D.A. Bennett C.D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 614-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) did not (Fig. 3D). Msx-2 is a homeodomain-containing protein, but it does not belong to the HOX family. The Msx-2 DNA binding element was identified from the osteocalcin promoter, and its flanking regions of the core sequence is different from Hoxc-8 binding site. There are three TAAT and two TTAT putative Hox sites identified from the osteopontin promoter. Hoxc-8 binds to only one of the TAAT core sequences (−206 to −180), suggesting that the flanking regions are also important for Hoxc-8 binding. The Hoxc-8 binding site, including its flanking regions, is highly conserved in chicken, mouse, pig, and human. The other four putative Hox sites may be involved in other homeodomain protein binding or may not be authentic Hox binding sites. Purified GST-Smad1 was examined for the effect of its interaction with Hoxc-8 on Hoxc-8 DNA binding activity. When GST-Hoxc-8 protein and its DNA binding element (OPN-5) were incubated with increasing amounts of GST-Smad1 protein, the binding of Hoxc-8 to the DNA probe was inhibited in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 4A, lanes 5–7). The same amount of GST protein did not have an effect on Hoxc-8 binding activity (Fig. 4B, lane 4). These results suggest that the interaction of Smad1 with Hoxc-8 dislodges Hoxc-8 from its response element. Because the signaling networks of the TGF-β superfamily are very complex, it is important to understand the specificity of the interaction between Hox and Smad proteins. Hoxa-9 was chosen as a well characterized homeobox DNA-binding protein (34Fromental-Ramain C. Warot X. Lakkaraju S. Favier B. Haack H. Birling C. Dierich A. Dolle P. Chambon P. Development. 1996; 122: 461-472PubMed Google Scholar, 35Cohn M.J. Patel K. Krumlauf R. Wllkinson D.G. Clarke J.D. Tickle C. Nature. 1997; 387: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) to examine its interaction with different Smad proteins. Two other homeodomain proteins, Msx-1 and Msx-2, were also used for gel shift assays for the same purpose. Msx-1 and Msx-2, found at different loci than the Hox gene clusters, are involved in development of teeth. The expression of both genes is coordinately regulated by BMP-2 and BMP-4 (36Phippard D.J. Weber-Hall S.J. Sharpe P.T. Naylor M.S. Jayatalake H. Maas R. Woo I. Roberts-Clark D. Francis-West P.H. Liu Y.H. Maxson R. Hill R.E. Dale T.C.

Inostroza J.A. Wilson J.M. Abate C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 15: 861-871Crossref Google Scholar). To estimate the relative strength of the interactions between the Smads and homeodomain proteins, the same amounts of Hoxc-8 and Hoxa-9 or Msx-1 and Msx-2 proteins were used in each of the gel shift assays with a fixed amount of different Smad proteins (Fig. 4, B and C). Smad1 and Smad4 inhibited both Hoxc-8 and Hoxa-9 binding, and the inhibition was enhanced when both Smad proteins were added together (Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 14). In contrast, neither Smad2 nor Smad3 interacted with these two Hox proteins. Fig. 4C showed that neither of the Msx proteins interacted with any of the four Smad proteins. GST did not affect Hox or Msx protein binding (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 11, and Fig. 4C, lanes 4and 10). The homeodomain, a well conserved DNA binding motif, is the region highly conserved between Hoxc-8 and Hoxa-9, suggesting that Smad1 interacts with other Hox proteins involved in BMP signaling. To examine whether the Hoxc-8 binding site functions as a BMP response element, we cloned a 266-base pair osteopontin promoter fragment containing the Hoxc-8 binding site into the pGL3-basic luciferase reporter vector to generate an OPN-266 reporter plasmid (Fig. 5A). Transfection of the OPN-266 construct in C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells showed that the reporter activity was stimulated moderately when Smad1 or Smad4 expression plasmids were co-transfected. The luciferase activity was significantly enhanced when the OPN-266 reporter construct was co-transfected with ALK3 (Q233D), Smad1, and Smad4 expression plasmids. Furthermore, the ALK3 (Q233D)-induced transcriptional activity was completely abolished when Hoxc-8 was overexpressed (Fig. 5B). To further define the transcription activity of the Hoxc-8 binding site, we linked a shorter osteopontin promoter fragment containing the Hoxc-8 binding site to a luciferase reporter vector under the control of the SV40 promoter (Hox-pGL3, Fig. 5A). When the Hox-pGL3 construct was co-transfected in C3H10T1/2 cells with ALK3 (Q233D) or ALK6 (Q203D), luciferase reporter activity was induced more than 13- and 11-fold, respectively. Most importantly, overexpression of Hoxc-8 suppressed the ALK3 (Q233D)-induced or ALK6 (Q203D)-induced reporter activity (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that the Hox binding site mediates BMP signaling and that Hoxc-8 functions as a transcription repressor. In comparison with the osteopontin native promoter, the Hox-pGL3 construct does not require overexpression of Smad1 and -4 in responding to BMP stimulation. This is an SV40 promoter-driven construct with a much shorter osteopontin promoter fragment, which does not contain many other transcription elements like the native osteopontin promoter construct. To validate whether the Hoxc-8 site mediates BMP signaling, we mutated the core nucleotides of the Hoxc-8 binding site from TAAT to GCCG to create mHox-pGL3 (Fig. 5A). Transfection of the mutant construct, mHox-pGL3, completely abolished the ALK3 (Q233D)-induced or ALK6 (Q203D)-induced reporter activity and eliminated Hoxc-8 inhibition in C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 5D). These results confirm that the osteopontin Hox binding site is a BMP response element. Several Smad downstream transcription factors have been characterized in the TGF-β pathway. Here, we first show that Hoxc-8 interacts with Smad1 as a downstream DNA-binding protein in the BMP pathway. Our data demonstrate that Hoxc-8 binds to the osteopontin promoter and represses the gene transcription. BMP stimulation activates gene transcription by derepressing the Hoxc-8 protein through the interaction of Smad1 with the Hoxc-8 protein. The direct interaction between Smad1 and Hox protein(s) suggests their functional relationship and the mechanisms in BMP-induced skeleton development. We are grateful to R. Wuthier, V.

These proteins can bind to carbohydrate antigens of microorganisms and inhibit their infection by direct neutralization and agglutination, the activation of complement through the lectin pathway, and opsonization by collectin receptors. Here we report the cloning of a cDNA encoding human collectin from liver (CL-L1 (collectin liver 1)) that has typical collectin structural characteristics, consisting of an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, a collagen-like domain, a neck domain, and a carbohydrate recognition domain. The cDNA has an insert of 831 base pairs coding for a protein of 277 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence shows that this collectin has a unique repeat of four lysine residues in its C-terminal area. Northern blot, Western blot, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that CL-L1 is present mainly in liver as a cytosolic protein and at low levels in placenta. More sensitive analyses by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions showed that most tissues (except skeletal muscle) have CL-L1 mRNA. Zoo-blot analysis indicated that CL-L1 is limited to mammals and birds. A chromosomal localization study indicated that the CL-L1 gene localizes to chromosome 8q23-q24.1, different from chromosome 10 of other human collectin genes. Expression studies of fusion proteins lacking the collagen and N-terminal domains produced in Escherichia coli affirmed that CL-L1 binds mannose weakly. CL-L1 and recombinant CL-L1 fusion proteins do not bind to mannan columns. Analysis of the phylogenetic tree of CL-L1 and other collectins indicated that CL-L1 belongs to a fourth subfamily of collectins following the mannan-binding protein, surfactant protein A, and surfactant protein D subfamilies including bovine conglutinin and collectin-43 (CL-43).

The isolation and functional characterization of novel collectins in addition to those described above might provide further insights into their functions. Here we report the cloning and preparation of recombinant fusion proteins and the characterization of human CL-L1 (collectin liver 1), a new member of the collectin family. CL-L1 is expressed mainly in liver, placenta, and adrenal gland and is expressed ubiquitously in most tissues, except skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, this new collectin is a cytosolic protein, although other all collectins are secreted proteins.

The partial clone (F1-1006D) from a fetal liver cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Hee-Sup Shin (Pohang Institute of Science and Technology) and used to screen a human liver cDNA library for full-length cDNAs by plaque hybridization. To generate a digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe, we used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers amplifying the cDNA probe were synthesized based on the 5′- and 3′-end nucleotide sequences of the insert in clone F1-1006D. The primers synthesized were 5′-GGCCAACACACTCATCGC-3′ for the reverse primer and 5′-TTACTTTTTTCTTCTTG-3′ for the forward primer. PCR was carried out using a PCR DIG labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The reaction mixture (50 μl) consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3; 50 mm KCl; 1.5 mm MgCl2; 200 mm each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 130 mm dTTP (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan); 70 mm digoxigenin-11-dUTP; 1.25 units ofTaq DNA polymerase; a 1 μm concentration of each primer; and 20 ng of cDNA clone F1-1006D. PCR was performed for 30 cycles in TaKaRa PCR Model 480 thermal cycler (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.), with each cycle consisting of denaturation for 45 s at 95 °C, annealing for 1 min at 60 °C, and extension for 2 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was electrophoresed on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) and then extracted from the gel using a Sephaglas BandPrep kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A phage library was screened essentially as described previously (17Kawai T. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Ohtani K. Kase T. Fujinaga Y. Sakamoto T. Kurimura T. Wakamiya N. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 186: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In brief, ∼1 × 106 plaque units of a human liver λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH) were plated withE. coli Y1090r− and incubated at 42 °C for 4 h. Nylon filters (Nytran 13N, Schleicher & Schüll) were prehybridized in hybridization buffer (5× SSC, 1% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine, and 0.02% SDS) for 1 h at 68 °C and then hybridized for 16 h at 55 °C with a digoxigenin-labeled probe in hybridization buffer. The filters were washed twice for 5 min in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then twice for 15 min in 0.5× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. The hybridized probe was detected by 30 min of incubation at room temperature with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Fab; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted 1:5000. The enzyme-catalyzed color reaction was carried out using a nitro blue tetrazolium salt/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate system (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) in buffer consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm MgCl2. The cDNA inserts in the positive clones were amplified using the primers described above and then directly subcloned in the pCR2.1 vector of a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The subclones were sequenced using an Autoread DNA sequencing kit and an A.L.F. Autosequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To identify the sequence including the transcriptional start site, we took the cDNA including the transcriptional start site from the Cap Site cDNATM (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd., Tokyo) of human liver by nested PCR (18Shimamoto A. Funaki H. Yamaguchi M. Watabiki M. Yoneda H. Furuichi Y. Seikagaku. 1997; 69: 574Google Scholar). This procedure is named cap site hunting (18Shimamoto A. Funaki H. Yamaguchi M. Watabiki M. Yoneda H. Furuichi Y. Seikagaku. 1997; 69: 574Google Scholar). The primer set for the first PCR was 5′-CAAGGTACGCCACAGCGTATG-3′ (primer 1RC2; Nippon Gene Inc., Ltd.) and 5′-TCTTCAGTTTCCCTAATCCC-3′ (primer PR1), synthesized by the manufacturer indicated. The primer set for the second PCR was 5′-GTACGCCACAGCGTATGATGC-3′ (primer 2RC2; Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.) and 5′-CATTCTTGACAAACTTCATAG-3′ (primer PR2), synthesized by the manufacturer indicated. The reaction mixture (50 μl) consisted of long and accurate (LA) PCR Buffer II (Mg2+-free); 2.5 mm MgCl2; 200 μm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP; 1 μl of Cap Site cDNATM from human liver; 1.25 units of TaKaRa LATaq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.); and 0.5 μm each primer 1RC2 and PR1 for the first PCR and primer 2RC2 and PR2 for the second PCR. The first PCR was performed for 35 cycles in the TaKaRa PCR Model 480 thermal cycler, with each cycle consisting of denaturation for 20 s at 95 °C, annealing for 20 s at 60 °C, and extension for 20 s at 72 °C. The second PCR was performed for 25 cycles in same buffer using 1 μl of the first PCR products as a probe. The final PCR products were extracted from the agarose gel after gel electrophoresis and directly subcloned into the pT7Blue vector (Novagen). The subclones were sequenced using the Autoread DNA sequencing kit and the A.L.F. Autosequencer. Genomic DNA was purified from human placenta by a standard method. Routinely, 4 μg of genomic DNA was completely digested with restriction enzymes, separated on 0.7% agarose gel, and vacuum-transferred to the Nytran 13N nylon filters. Blots were prehybridized in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) at 68 °C for 30 min and then hybridized for 1 h at 68 °C with a 10 ng/ml concentration of the digoxigenin-labeled probe corresponding to a fragment of the CRD in the same buffer as used for prehybridization. The filters were washed for 5 min in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then for 15 min in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 68 °C. The hybridized probe was detected by a chemiluminescent technique (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. Zoo-blot analysis was performed with the modified method described above using completely EcoRI-digested genomic DNAs (5 μg) from human, rhesus monkey, cow, dog, rabbit, rat, mouse, chicken, and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing were performed at 58 °C for the same time periods. The probe (which corresponded to the CRD) for the zoo-blot analysis was made with the PCR DIG labeling kit. A human multiple-tissue Northern blot membrane was purchased from CLONTECH. It contained 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNAs from human heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. The membranes were prehybridized at 65 °C for 3 h in a solution containing 5× SSC, 10× Denhardt's solution, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.5% SDS, 50% formamide, and 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was then performed for 18 h at 65 °C with RNA synthesized in vitro and labeled with digoxigenin using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The template for the RNA probe was a whole cDNA insert subcloned into pSPT18. The filters were washed twice for 5 min in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then for 15 min in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 68 °C. The hybridized probe was detected as described above. Reverse transcription was carried out using total RNAs (1 μg) from brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, trachea, bone marrow, colon, small intestine, spleen, stomach, thymus, mammary gland, prostate, skeletal muscle, testis, uterus, placenta, adrenal gland, pancreas, salivary gland, and thyroid. Oligo(dT)-adaptor primers (RNA LA PCR kit (avian myeloblastosis virus), Version 1.1, Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) were used for the reverse transcription reaction. The reverse transcription products were amplified by 28 or 35 cycles of PCR using degenerate first primers (0.2 μg), TaKaRa LA Taq polymerase (1.25 units), and reverse transcription reaction products in a TaKaRa PCR Model MP thermal cycler. Nested PCRs were performed using the PCR products as a probe after 35 cycles of RT-PCR. The primer set for the first PCR was 5′-TAGCAAATACGTAGGATGAG-3′ for the reverse primer and 5′-CCACAGCAATGAATGGCTTT-3′ for the forward primer. The inner primer set for nested PCR was 5′-TTACTTTTTCTTCTTGATGA-3′ for the reverse primer and 5′-ATGAATGGCTTTGCATCCTT-3′ for the forward primer. These primers were located in the neck and CRD regions, which spanned an intron in genomic DNA. Amplicons were separated on 1.0% agarose gels. The ∼10-kilobase pair human CL-L1 genomic DNA fragment from the neck domain to the CRD, biotin-labeled with a nick translation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), was used as a probe. The gene was localized by fluorescence in situ hybridization and PCR analysis using DNAs from human monochromosomal fusion cells kindly provided by Dr. Hashimoto (National Institute of Infectious Diseases). Map position was determined by inspection of fluorescent signals on 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained chromosomes. 25 metaphase preparations were analyzed. The recombinant fusion protein with the maltose-binding protein of E. coli was expressed using the expression vector pMAL-c2 system (New England Biolabs Inc.). E. coli XL1-Blue, which carries the plasmid containing the proper insert of neck and CRD fragments as described previously (19Eda S. Suzuki Y. Kawai T. Ohtani K. Kase T. Fujinaga Y. Sakamoto T. Kurimura T. Wakamiya N. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), was grown toA 600 nm ∼ 0.5 in 200 ml of LB medium supplemented with 0.5% glucose. After addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, the culture was incubated for an additional 3 h, and the cells were harvested. The cell pellets were suspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer and lysed by sonication (15 s, 70% output, 10 times). After centrifugation at 9000 ×g for 30 min, the supernatant was diluted with 5 volumes of column buffer/T and applied to an amylose resin column (New England Biolabs Inc.). The column was washed with column buffer/T and column buffer, and the recombinant fusion protein (CL-L1-CRDmal) was eluted with column buffer containing 10 mm maltose. The eluate was dialyzed against three changes of 1000 volumes of TBS/C and used for further characterization. To obtain another truncated CL-L1 protein (CL-L1-CRDhis), a new expression vector (pPLH3) was constructed and used. This vector consisted of a λPl-Trp fusion promoter and histidine hexamer coding sequence just downstream from the ATG initiation codon. Recombinant proteins expressed by this vector system will have N-terminal MHHHHHH sequences. E. coli GI724, containing the plasmid with the neck and CRD fragments, was grown at 30 °C to A 600 nm ∼ 0.5 in 200 ml of induction base medium with glucose. After addition of tryptophan to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, the culture was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, and the cells were harvested. The cells were suspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer A and lysed by sonication (15 s, 70% output, 10 times). After centrifugation at 9000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (QIAGEN Inc.) for 15 min, and the gel was loaded onto a column. The column was washed with column buffers B and C. The histidine-tagged recombinant protein was eluted with column buffers D and E. The eluate was dialyzed against 1000 volume of TBS, followed by two changes of 1000 volumes of TBS/C. This CL-L1 fusion protein (CL-L1-CRDhis) was used to produce antisera in New Zealand White rabbits. Purification and identification of the recombinant CL-L1 CRDs were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the rabbit anti-CL-L1 CRD serum. The binding of recombinant CL-L1-CRDmal to mannose (mannose-biotin probe) was measured by ELISA with avidin-biotinylated peroxidase (Vector Labs, Inc.). Microtiter plates were coated at 4 °C overnight with CL-L1-CRDmal, maltose-binding protein as a negative control, and recombinant human MBP from Chinese hamster ovary cells as a positive control (10 μg of each in 100 μl of coating buffer (15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, and 0.05% (w/v) NaN3, pH 9.6)). The plates were washed three times with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.05% NaN3, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 after each step. After coating, the plates were blocked with Block Ace (Dainippon Seiyaku, Tokyo) for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, the samples were supplemented with an α-d-mannose BP-probe (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo) at various concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/ml) with or without mannan (10 mg/ml) or EDTA (10 mm). The lectins, α-d-mannose BP-probe, and VECTASTAIN Elite ABC reagents (Vector Labs, Inc.) were added sequentially and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C at each step. Finally, 100 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine microwell peroxidase substrate, Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories) was applied to each well. Before and after addition of 100 μl of 1 m phosphoric acid, the A450 nm was read with a Model 450 microplate reader (Bio-Rad). The monosaccharide specificities of CL-L1 were analyzed using the same ELISA system. The microplates were coated with CL-L1-CRDmal and maltose-binding protein (10 μg of each). Saccharide-biotin probes were used with the α-d-mannose, α-d-fucose, β-d-galactose, β-N-acetylglucosamine, and α-N-acetylgalactosamine BP-probes (Seikagaku Kogyo). The inhibition studies were done with EDTA (10 mm) and mannan (10 mg/ml). The staining procedure was described above. Another characterization was performed using a sugar-blot method (20Kamemura K. Kato M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recombinant CL-L1 CRDs, maltose-binding protein, and recombinant human MBP (1 μg of each) were dissolved in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (10–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel), and transferred to BioBlot-NC membranes (Coster Co.) by standard procedures. After treating the membranes with TBS/TC (20 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 mmCaCl2) with or without EDTA (10 mm), they were incubated with the α-d-mannose BP-probe alone or together with EDTA (10 mm) or mannan (100 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 60 min, washed with TBS/TC, and then incubated with the VECTASTAINElite ABC kit in TBS/TC for 60 min. After washing in TBS/TC, the membranes were stained with 3,3′5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution. Cytosolic and microsomal fractions from human liver were prepared as described previously (21de Duve C. Pressman B.C. Gianetto R. Wattiaux R. Applemans F. Biochem. J. 1955; 60: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2572) Google Scholar). Solutions of recombinant CL-L1-CRDhis, CL-L1-CRDmal, and maltose-binding proteins were dissolved with SDS sample buffer in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and applied to a 10–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, gels were transferred to BioBlot-NC membranes. The blots were blocked with Block Ace in TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and then treated with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-CL-L1-CRDhis serum or rabbit anti-human MBP serum. The bound antibodies were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon International, Inc.) diluted 1:5000 and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories). The primary hepatocyte cells (Cell Systems Corp.) were plated and cultured at a density of 3 × 104 cells/0.2 ml in a 14-mm hole of 35-mm plastic culture dishes (Matsunami Glass Industries, Ltd., Kishiwada, Japan) in CS-C complete medium (Cell Systems Corp.). They were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, and treated with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-MBP serum or rabbit anti-CL-L1-CRDhis serum with or without PBS containing 400 μg/ml recombinant CL-L1-CRDmal and 25% Block Ace and fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon International, Inc.) diluted 1:200. The cells were then treated with 1 drop of SlowFade antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc.), mounted, and sealed. The fluorescence images were observed with a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope, and photographs were prepared with Filing Imaging Software U6341 (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.). The comparison of the amino acid sequence of the CRD of CL-L1 with the GenBankTM sequences below was done using the DNASIS Sequence Analysis Program (Hitachi). A phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method (22Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) using the amino acid sequences of the CRD of CL-L1, human MBP (23Ezekowitz R.A. Kuhlman M. Groopman J.E. Byrn R.A. J. Exp.

Hawgood S. Benson B. Cordell B. Nature. 1985; 317: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic relationships were analyzed using the computer program PHYLIP Version 3.57c package (25Kawai T. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Ohtani K. Kase T. Sakamoto T. Uemura H. Wakamiya N. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We screened DNA data bases to identify novel members of the collectin family. This resulted in the identification of a cDNA fragment from human EST data bases that showed carboxyl-terminal sequence homology to the collectins. The EST clone F1-1006D from a fetal liver cDNA library was used to screen a human liver cDNA library, and two positive clones (HL11-3M and HL11-9) were isolated. Furthermore, cap site hunting was performed to determine the complete 5′-terminal sequence including the transcriptional start site of CL-L1 mRNA using Cap Site cDNATM (18Shimamoto A. Funaki H. Yamaguchi M. Watabiki M. Yoneda H. Furuichi Y. Seikagaku. 1997; 69: 574Google Scholar). Restriction map analysis and sequencing of the clones revealed that they contained an open reading frame encoding a sequence of 277 amino acid residues. The cDNA contained a 75-nucleotide 5′-nontranslated sequence, followed by 831 nucleotides corresponding to a whole protein and a 759-nucleotide 3′-nontranslated sequence with an AATAA incomplete polyadenylation signal (Fig. 1). The deduced amino acid sequence from the cDNA revealed a collectin structure consisting of an N-terminal region with cysteine residues, a collagen-like region, a neck region, and a CRD. A hydrophobic signal peptide sequence was not evident at the N-terminal region, and the amino-terminal residue of the mature protein was unknown. To examine the distribution of CL-L1 mRNA, Northern blot analyses were performed with mRNAs from various human tissues. The Northern blot was hybridized at high stringency with a probe derived from a CL-L1 cDNA clone. Two bands of ∼1.2 and 3.8 kilobases were detected in liver and also at low levels in placenta (Fig. 2A). The 1.2-kilobase mRNA was considerably more abundant than the 3.8-kilobase mRNA. RT-PCR analyses showed that most tissues, except skeletal muscle, expressed CL-L1 mRNAs. Slightly high expression levels of CL-L1 mRNAs were found in liver, placenta, adrenal gland, lung, small intestine, and prostate (Fig. 2B). Genomic DNA analyses were performed with several animal DNAs. Zoo blotting showed that all mammalian and avian species have the CL-L1 gene, but it is absent in yeast"
https://openalex.org/W1971541597,"Cellular signaling downstream of Ras is highly diversified and may involve many different effector molecules. A potential candidate is AF6 which was originally identified as a fusion to ALL-1 in acute myeloid leukemia. In the present work the interaction between Ras and AF6 is characterized and compared with other effectors. The binding characteristics are quite similar to Raf and RalGEF, i.e. nucleotide dissociation as well as GTPase-activating protein activity are inhibited, whereas the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras is unperturbed by AF6 binding. Particularly, the dynamics of interaction are similar to Raf and RalGEF with a lifetime of the Ras·AF6 complex in the millisecond range. As probed by 31P NMR spectroscopy one of two major conformational states of Ras is stabilized by the interaction with AF6. Looking at the affinities of AF6 to a number of Ras mutants in the effector region, a specificity profile emerges distinct from that of other effector molecules. This finding may be useful in defining the biological function of AF6 by selectively switching off other pathways downstream of Ras using the appropriate effector mutant. Notably, among the Ras-related proteins AF6 binds most tightly to Rap1A which could imply a role of Rap1A in AF6 regulation.

Cellular functions like growth and differentiation are regulated by a complex network of interacting proteins with either enzymatic or adaptor functions. Ras plays a central role in this signaling network. It is bound to GDP in its resting state and bound to GTP after activation (1Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). Only this activated form can interact with effector molecules like Raf kinase, RalGEF, and PI(3)kinase 1The abbreviation used is: PI(3)kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibition; GppNHp, guanyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate; mant, 2′,3′-(N-methylanthraniloyl), a fluorophor attached at 2′- or 3′-position to the nucleotide; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RalGEF, Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor; RBD, Ras binding domain; X-Gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactopyranoside; aa, amino acids; GAP, GTPase-activating protein. (2Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). A variety of incoming signals is directed to Ras activation, and this in turn triggers the activation of different signal pathways that lead to diverse consequences such as induction of DNA transcription, inhibition of apoptosis, and/or cytoskeletal rearrangements (3Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Synergism with other signaling events or inhibition by competing pathways may supplement or modulate the signal amplitude resulting in a distinct effect. When Ras binds to the effectors they become activated by different and not fully understood mechanisms. This leads to the activation of other molecules located further downstream in the signal cascade. There are other small GTP-binding proteins closely related to Ras like Rap1A/2A, TC21, and R-Ras which also bind to the Ras effectors. So far little is known about their biological functions. The effectors c-Raf-1 (4Vojtek A.B. Der J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), RalGEF (5Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A.

Alder H. Nakamura T. Canaani O. Saito H. Huebner K. Gale R.P. Nowell P.C. Kuriyama K. Miyazaki Y. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5624-5628PubMed Google Scholar). AF6 is a homolog of Canoe inDrosophila which is genetically linked to the Notch cascade and other signaling pathways (15Miyamoto H. Nihonmatsu I. Kondo S. Ueda R. Togashi S. Hirata K. Ikegami Y. Yamamoto D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 612-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Canoe and AF6 have the PDZ domain which in the case of AF6 was shown to bind to the Eph3B receptor (16Hock B. Böhme B. Karn T. Yamamoto T. Kaibuchi K. Holtrich U. Holland S. Pawson T. Rübsamen-Waigmann H. Strebhardt K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9779-9784Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of AF6 was identified as the Ras-binding site (12van Aelst L. White M. Wigler M.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,13Kuriyama M. Harada N. Kuroda S. Yamamoto T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Yamamoto D. Prasad R. Croce C. Canaani E. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (187) Google Scholar). ZO-1, a protein involved in the formation of tight junctions, also binds to AF6 close to the amino terminus thereby competing with Ras binding (17Yamamoto T. Harada N. Kano K. Taya S. Canaani E. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These data suggest a participation of AF6 in the regulation of cell-cell contacts via a Ras-modulated interaction with ZO-1. Further evidence for this role of AF6 comes from the discovery ofl-Afadin, a larger AF6 splicing variant in rat which additionally carries an actin-binding site at the carboxyl terminus (18Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M. Mizoguchi A. Aoki T. Fujimoto T. Matsuda Y. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). l-Afadin appears to serve as a linker between the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane in adherens junctions. A recent finding that the de-ubiquitinating enzyme Fam (fat facets in mouse) interacts with AF6 suggests that the AF6 action is based on the turnover of participating proteins (19Taya S. Yamamoto T. Kano K. Kawano Y. Iwamatsu A. Tsuchiya T. Tanaka K. Kanai-Azuma M. Wood S.A. Mattick J.S. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast to the well characterized effectors Raf, RalGEF, and PI(3)kinase, AF6 is a protein with no enzymatic function. It seems to serve as a scaffolding component for protein complexes. This would represent a new type of Ras effector because Ras binding in this case does not lead to the activation of the enzymatic activity of the effector. In contrast, for the regulation of Raf only transient Ras binding is necessary. Therefore in this work the Ras binding domain (RBD) of AF6 is defined, and its interaction with Ras is characterized by thermodynamic and kinetic parameters and compared with the binding behavior of the RBDs of Raf and RalGEF. Since for other effectors highly specific binding to different Ras proteins was demonstrated, all members of the Ras subfamily are included in this investigation. Rat and human AF6 fragments were amplified via standard polymerase chain reaction methods, ligated into pGEX and yeast plasmids, respectively, and transformed into Bl21 and DH5α. Mutations were introduced in Ras by standard polymerase chain reaction protocols (20Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). All clones were verified by sequencing (ABI-Prism, Perkin-Elmer). Yeast two-hybrid studies were performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y190 according to the system of Chevray and Nathans (21Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Briefly, competent Y190 cells were prepared as described (22Klebe R.J. Hariss J.V. Sharp Z.D. Douglas M.G. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and cotransformed with 1 μg of each of the two-hybrid vectors. Efficient transformation was checked on synthetic medium lacking leucine and tryptophan (−Leu/Trp). Transformed yeast cells were grown on synthetic medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine containing 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,3-triazole (−Leu/Trp/His, Sigma) for the indicated time in order to detect interaction between Ras and the AF6 constructs (Fig. 1). 2% glucose was used in all media as the carbon source. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by filter-lifting the yeast cells grown on −Leu/Trp/His medium and staining the yeast cells with 1 mg/ml X-Gal at 37 °C for the indicated time. The Escherichia coli strain Bl21 was grown in standard I medium (Merck), and the expression of the pGEX plasmid encoding the glutathione S-transferase/AF6-RBD fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside after OD = 0.6 was reached. The culture was incubated at 30 °C for 4 h and then centrifuged. The resuspended cell pellet was sonicated, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation (32,000 × g). The insoluble and soluble fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicating that the glutathioneS-transferase/AF6-RBD fusion protein (42 kDa) is readily soluble (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). The glutathione S-transferase fusion was purified according to the standard procedure by means of a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After protein cleavage by thrombin (10 units/ml, overnight) and elution of AF6-RBD from the column (Fig. 2, lanes 3–6), this protein fragment was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein fractions were analyzed for purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pooled, and concentrated to 20 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (Vivaspin 15, Vivascience), shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The preparation of the Ras proteins and the nucleotide exchange procedure are described (23Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The catalytic fragment of p120-GAP comprising residues 714–1047 was kindly provided by R. Ahmadian (see Ref. 24Ahmadian M.R. Hoffmann U. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4535-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using the dye assay described by Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used for calibration. Nucleotide concentrations in the GTPase assay were quantified by HPLC (Beckman) using a reversed phase C18 column (ODS Ultrasphere, Beckman). For further details see Lenzenet al. (26Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 225: 95-109Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were carried out on a spectrofluorimeter (Fluoromax, Spex) equipped with a thermostatting device. For stopped-flow measurements an SM-17 apparatus (Applied Photophysics) was used. Rate constants can reliably be measured up to 500 s−1 since the dead time for the mixing of two solutions is in the range of 1–2 ms. Ras·mant-GppNHp was mixed with AF6-RBD in more than 5-fold molar excess in order to have pseudo-first order conditions for the association. Accordingly, the fluorescence traces monitored were fitted with an exponential curve yieldingk obs. Mant nucleotides were excited at 360 nm, and the fluorescence was monitored through a 408-nm cut-off filter. If not indicated otherwise, all experiments were carried out in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The proteins were transferred into other buffers using Nap-5 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Differential scanning calorimetry was performed with a VP-DSC (MicroCal Science). Evaluation of the data was done with the manufacturer's software (Microcal Origin 4.1). Briefly, the buffer base line was subtracted from the experimental curve. According to the two-state model a curve was fitted to the experimental data including ΔC p effects. The NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DMX-500 spectrometer operating at a phosphorous resonance frequency of 202 MHz. The signal was referenced to 85% phosphoric acid which was sealed in a glass sphere immersed in the sample. Further experimental conditions are given in Fig. 8. For the biochemical and structural characterization of the interaction of AF6 with Ras and other small GTPases, bacterial synthesis of recombinant protein at reasonable levels is required. In order to define a soluble and stable protein fragment which comprises the minimal Ras binding domain of the AF6 protein, different constructs were tested for their ability to bind to Ras. In a first step this was done semi-quantitatively by the double hybrid assay as described by Jaitner et al. (27Jaitner B.K. Becker J. Linnemann T. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Block C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29927-29933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). RasG12V truncated by the 23 carboxyl-terminal amino acids was introduced into pPC97 and cotransformed with different AF6 constructs ligated into pPC86. The construct starting from the amino terminus (amino acids 1–170) as described by van Aelst et al. (12van Aelst L. White M. Wigler M.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showed a strong signal in this system (Fig. 1) indicating a strong interaction with Ras. These colonies grow within 3 days, and the stain seen in Fig. 1, panel C, developed after 70 min incubation with X-Gal. Shortening this fragment by 21 and 29 amino acids at its carboxyl-terminal end, respectively, improved binding significantly (Fig. 1, panel B). The X-Gal response is similar to that of Ras and Raf-RBD which are known to interact strongly (27Jaitner B.K. Becker J. Linnemann T. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Block C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29927-29933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions the sequence of the RBD of AF6 (aa 36–206) reported earlier (13Kuriyama M. Harada N. Kuroda S. Yamamoto T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Yamamoto D. Prasad R. Croce C. Canaani E. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (187) Google Scholar) did not support growth in the Y190 strain. A similar result was obtained with another amino-terminal truncated sequence (aa 30–141) which contains all residues from the predicted RBD of AF6 (28Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The latter showed only small colonies after 9 days of growth which gave a poor X-Gal stain after overnight incubation (data not shown). The DNAs encoding different AF6 constructs, namely residues 1–84, 13–133, 30–141, and 1–141, were transferred into pGEX-4T3 vectors and expressed in the bacterial strain BL21 in order to check the integrity and the solubility of the protein fragments. The two former fragments were poorly soluble and were partly degraded in E. coli. From the two latter protein fragments 30–141 bound much less strongly to Ras than 1–141 (assay see below). From these observations we concluded that the Ras binding domain (RBD) of AF6 requires residues 1–141 for full integrity and strong binding to Ras. This fragment is defined as AF6-RBD and is used for further biochemical experiments in this study. By size exclusion chromatography and comparison to the elution volumes of standard proteins (data not shown), it was demonstrated that AF6-RBD is a homogeneously monomeric protein. To check the stability of AF6-RBD and to show that it constitutes a stable folding domain, it was further characterized by differential scanning calorimetry. A solution of AF6-RBD was heated from 20 to 80 °C at 70 °C/h, and unfolding was monitored with the change in the heat capacity C p (Fig. 3). The reversibility of the unfolding transition in a solution at pH 9.0 was reasonably high for a thermodynamic analysis, i.e. 85% recovery of folded protein after each scan. This analysis was carried out under the assumption of a two-state equilibrium, i.e. the protein is either in the native, folded state, or in the unfolded state, and no intermediates occur (29Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1979; 33: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Such a behavior is seen for most small proteins which constitute a single cooperativity unit. The fit to the data yielded ΔH u = 62.7 kcal/mol for the enthalpy of unfolding and T m = 56,1 °C for the melting temperature. The scanning rate had no influence on the melting point and the enthalpy. At 40 and 90 °C/h 60 and 95% reversibility of unfolding was observed, respectively, which can be explained by the different times the unfolded protein was kept at high temperature. The quasi-reversible unfolding transition may be taken as additional evidence for the integrity of AF6-RBD. In our earlier studies on the interaction of Ras proteins with effector RBDs, we made use of the inhibition of nucleotide dissociation from Ras upon effector binding (30Herrmann C. Nassar N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). AF6-RBD also inhibits nucleotide dissociation from Ras. In this GDI assay Ras is quantitatively loaded with the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog with a fluorescent label attached to the ribose moiety. The dissociation of this nucleotide mant-GppNHp is initiated by adding a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled GppNHp. The fluorescence decay due to quasi-irreversible mant-GppNHp dissociation is monitored and fitted by an exponential function. The obtained rate constants are plottedversus AF6-RBD concentration and a curve fitted according to Equation 2 yields the dissociation constant K d as defined in Equation 1. Equation 2 may be applied since the equilibration of the Ras·AF6 complex is fast compared with the nucleotide dissociation as shown below. The Ras protein, the nucleotide, and the effector AF6-RBD are abbreviated by R, N, and E, respectively, and k −1and k −2 represent the nucleotide dissociation rate constants from Ras alone and from the Ras·effector complex, respectively. Index 0 denotes total concentrations.Kd=[R−N]*[E][R−N−E](Eq. 1) kobs=k−1−(k−1−k−2)(Eq. 2) ·([Ro]+[Eo]+Kd)−([Ro]+[Eo]+Kd)2−4·[Ro]·[Eo]2·[Ro]In Fig. 4 the dependence of the observed nucleotide dissociation rate constant on the AF6-RBD concentration is shown for Rap1A and Ras. The K dvalues obtained from these data and also for Rap2A, R-Ras, and TC21 are listed in Table I, and it is remarkable that Rap1A binds more than 10-fold more tightly to AF6-RBD than Ras and Rap2A, respectively.Table IKd values for AF6-RBD and members of the Ras subfamilyK dμmHa-Ras3.0Ha-Ras (GDP)>100Ha-Ras E31K2.3Ha-Ras T35S>100Ha-Ras E37G33Ha-Ras D38A36Ha-Ras Y40C>100Ha-Ras E62A7.6Ha-Ras E63A7.2Rap1A0.25Rap1A (GDP)>100Rap2A3.7R-Ras16TC2116The data were obtained with the GDI method with mantGppNHp and mantGDP bound to the Ras protein. For some proteins K d > 100 μm is indicated. This means that up to AF6-RBD concentrations of 100 μm less than 50% inhibition of nucleotide dissociation is observed. Open table in a new tab The data were obtained with the GDI method with mantGppNHp and mantGDP bound to the Ras protein. For some proteins K d > 100 μm is indicated. This means that up to AF6-RBD concentrations of 100 μm less than 50% inhibition of nucleotide dissociation is observed. It was also possible to measure the affinity between Ras and AF6-RBD by means of direct fluorescence titration. At 20 °C the fluorescence of Ras·mant-GppNHp drops by 12% on saturation with AF6-RBD as shown in Fig. 5, upper panel. In thelower panel a curve is fitted to the titration data according to Equation 2 where k −1 and k −2 are replaced by the maximum and minimum fluorescence values, respectively, and k obs is replaced by the relative fluorescence. The K d value of 1.8 μm obtained from this fit is in good agreement with the result of 3.0 μm from the GDI assay regarding the difference in temperature. At 37 °C the titration is impossible since there is almost no change in fluorescence detectable. On addition of 100 μm AF6-RBD to Ras·mant-GDP no change in fluorescence is seen (Fig. 5, upper panel). As for the GDI data this is explained by the lack of binding at this concentration which means that the affinity of AF6 to the GDP form of Ras is at least 33-fold lower compared with the GTP form. Evidence has accumulated during the last few years that Ras signaling branches out into several distinct pathways (for review see Ref. 30Herrmann C. Nassar N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) the output of which may depend on the type of the cell or on the synergism with other stimuli. By cell transformation studies it was shown that certain mutations in the Ras effector region lead to abrogation of signaling to distinct effectors. The mutants T35S, E37G, and Y40C appear to cause discrimination between the effectors Raf, RalGEF, and PI(3)kinase (31White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H.

As an example T35S is believed to merely activate Raf, E37G only activates RalGEF, whereas Y40C is reported to activate only PI(3)kinase. D38A is the most prominent effector mutant of Ras which decreases the affinity to Raf- and RalGEF-RBD, respectively, by approximately 2 orders of magnitude (23Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar,30Herrmann C. Nassar N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All these mutants were tested for their ability to bind AF6-RBD, and the K d values obtained by the GDI method are listed in Table I. The mutations T35S and Y40C, respectively, prevent interaction with AF6-RBD up to a concentration of 100 μm. In contrast, the Ras mutant E37G decreases the affinity only 10-fold, and the same small decrease of complex stability is found for D38A. Mutation at position 31 which is known to be a strongly discriminative amino acid of Ras and Rap1A for Raf and RalGEF binding (23Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol.

As AF6-RBD has an influence on the nucleotide binding to Ras, it was worthwhile to look at the effect on GTP hydrolysis activity of Ras. At 37 °C 50 μm Ras loaded with GTP was incubated in the absence and in the presence of saturating amounts of AF6-RBD (100 μm). The time course of GTP hydrolysis by Ras was monitored by HPLC analysis of the nucleotides. The data obtained in Fig. 6were fitted according to first order kinetics. For both experiments the same rate constants were calculated (0.03 min−1) demonstrating that AF6-RBD binding to Ras does not change its GTPase activity. Effector molecules and GAPs bind to overlapping sites on Ras (37Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Block C. Jahnknecht R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct.

Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the catalytic activity of GAP is inhibited by Raf and RalGEF (21Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In order to check if AF6 binds to Ras in the same manner as the other effectors, the inhibition of GAP was investigated. 50 μm Ras·GTP and 4 nm of the catalytic fragment of GAP were incubated at 37 °C, and the nucleotide concentrations were probed at short time intervals (Fig. 6). The addition of AF6-RBD reduced the catalytic activity of GAP suggesting but not proving competitive binding of AF6 and GAP. In the presence of saturating amounts of AF6-RBD the binding of GAP is completely inhibited as the rate of GTP hydrolysis corresponds to the intrinsic activity of Ras (Fig. 6). When Ras binds to Raf, RalGEF, or PI(3)kinase, it activates the enzymatic activity of these effector molecules by not fully understood mechanisms. Although Ras binds tightly to Raf, it was shown that these proteins form a short-lived complex (41Gorman C. Skinner R.H. Skelly J.V. Neidle S. Lowe P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6713-6719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 42Sydor J.R. Engelhardt M. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Herrmann C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14292-14299Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This highly dynamic behavior of the Ras·Raf complex could be important for the activation of Raf kinase activity or for the down-regulation of Ras by GAP. For the Ras·RalGEF complex similar interaction dynamics are observed. 2T. Linnemann and C. Herrmann, unpublished observations. The binding kinetics of Ras/AF6 were investigated by means of the stopped-flow technique. The fluorescence change observed on binding of AF6-RBD to mant-GppNHp-loaded Ras proteins as described above (Fig. 5) was used as detection signal. For Ras as well as for Rap1A the observed rate constant k obs showed a linear dependence on the concentration of AF6-RBD up to 15 μm. From the linear slope fitted to the data k on, the apparent association rate constant, is obtained, and the intercept corresponds to the dissociation rate constant k off. The dissociation rate"

Exposure of endothelial cells transfected with PAR-1 promoter-luciferase reporter construct to either thrombin or PAR-1 activating peptide increased the steady-state PAR-1 mRNA and reporter activity, respectively. Pretreatment of reporter-transfected endothelial cells with pertussis toxin or co-expression of a minigene encoding 11-amino acid sequence of COOH-terminal Gαi prevented the thrombin-induced increase in reporter activity. Pertussis toxin treatment also prevented thrombin-induced MAPK phosphorylation, indicating a role of Gαi in activating the downstream MAPK pathway. Expression of constitutively active Gαi2 mutant or Gβ1γ2 subunits increased reporter activity 3–4-fold in the absence of thrombin stimulation. Co-expression of dominant negative mutants of either Ras or MEK1 with the reporter construct inhibited the thrombin-induced PAR-1 expression, whereas constitutively active forms of either Ras or MEK1 activated PAR-1 expression in the absence of thrombin stimulation. Expression of dominant negative Src kinase or inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase also prevented the MAPK activation and PAR-1 expression. We conclude that thrombin-induced activation of PAR-1 mediates PAR-1 expression by signaling through Gi1/2 coupled to Src and phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and thereby activating the downstream Ras/MAPK cascade.

Activation of PAR-1 by cleavage of the NH2 terminus of PAR-1 results in changes in endothelial cell function such as expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and increased endothelial permeability (7Bahou W.F.

The regulatory mechanisms underlying PAR-1 gene expression are not well characterized. Thrombin-induced PAR-1 cleavage leads to PAR-1 endocytosis and degradation in lysosomes (10Hein L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. Kobilka B.K. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27719-27726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, the activated PAR-1 is unable to recycle to the cell membrane and resensitize cells to thrombin as with other G protein-coupled receptors (10Hein L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. Kobilka B.K. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27719-27726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that endothelial cells also contain a preformed pool of PAR-1 that translocates within minutes to the cell surface in response to thrombin (10Hein L. Ishii K.

This protein synthesis-independent PAR-1 expression confers thrombin sensitivity by rapidly replenishing the cell surface PAR-1 (10Hein L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. Kobilka B.K. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27719-27726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, this pool has a limited and short-lived ability to resensitize endothelial cells to thrombin (5Ellis C.A. Tiruppathi C. Sandoval R. Niles W.D. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C38-C45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, thrombin responsiveness required de novo PAR-1 synthesis (5Ellis C.A. Tiruppathi C. Sandoval R. Niles W.D. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C38-C45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that it is necessary to activate synthesis of PAR-1 to regenerate fully the cell surface PAR-1 population once the preformed receptor pool has been depleted. PAR-1 has been shown to couple functionally with multiple heterotrimeric G proteins, which may in part explain the pleiotropic actions of thrombin (12Vu T.K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.

The cells were grown in endothelial basal medium MCDB-131 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mg/ml hydrocortisone. Human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) obtained from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego, CA) were grown in EBM-2 medium supplemented 10% FBS. Cells were cultured on tissue culture dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin. Cells were used between passages 4 and 8. Endothelial cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 2 h prior to agonist exposure for the indicated times. Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, following treatment, cells were lysed using 2 ml of TRIzol reagent/100-mm2 tissue culture dish. Chloroform (0.2 volume) was added to cell lysate, and the aqueous phase was collected by centrifugation. The total cellular RNA from the aqueous phase was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol for 1–2 h at −70 °C. After centrifugation, the RNA pellet was collected, washed with 75% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water containing 0.5% SDS. RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry. Approximately equal amounts of total cellular RNA was separated on a denaturing 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel. After separation, the RNA was transferred to Duralose membranes and immobilized. The membranes were prehybridized for 1 h at 68 °C in Quickhyb solution and hybridized for 2 h at 68 °C with a 1.36-kb thrombin receptor cDNA probe (provided by Dr. S. R. Coughlin, University of California, San Francisco) and 1.1-kb glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The cDNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using a Prime-It II kit (Stratagene). The membranes were washed and visualized by autoradiography. Autoradiograms were scanned into a personal computer, and levels of PAR-1 and GAPDH mRNA were quantified by NIH Image version 1.6. -Fold increase was determined as PAR-1/GAPDH ratio) × (untreated PAR-1/GAPDH ratio)−1. A 1.82-kb PAR-1 promoter sequence was made by PCR amplification of directly upstream of the initiation codon from an ∼3.0-kb exon I containing PAR-1 gene 5′-untranslated region (19Schmidt V.A. Vitale E. Bahou W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9307-9312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The proximal primer incorporated aHindIII restriction site into the sequence for subcloning purposes (proximal primer 3′-aagcttttgtcccgggctctgcgcggcgctgc-5′; distal primer 5′-aagctttatttaactgggtacttcc-3′). The amplified fragment (PCR-1) was inserted into pUC118 for amplification and restriction analysis. This plasmid, PCR-1/pUC118, was digested withKpnI/BglII to release PCR-1 with cohesive ends compatible with KpnI/BamHI-digested pGL2 to form PCR-1/Luc. The sea pansy (R. reniformis) luciferase gene driven by herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter (TK/pRL) served as an internal control to correct for experimental variation. HMEC, grown in six-well plates to 50–70% confluence, were incubated with LipofectAMINE-DNA complexes for 2–4 h. LipofectAMINE-DNA complexes were made by incubating 4 μg of LipofectAMINE with 0.1–1.0 μg of plasmid DNA in 0.2 ml of Opti-MEM I for 45 min at 22 °C. LipofectAMINE-DNA complexes were diluted with 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM I before being added to HMEC, prewashed two times with Opti-MEM I, for 2–4 h. To end transfection, 2 ml of MCDB 131 medium supplemented with 10% FBS was added to each well. We determined the transfection efficiency in HMEC using green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid, which encodes a mutated form of the GFP gene driven by a cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. HMEC transfected with GFP plasmid were visualized by fluorescence microscopy with a blue filter (peak excitation 490 nm). Approximately 30% of HMEC appeared green 24 h after being transfected with GFP plasmid DNA. After transfection, the cells were incubated in growth medium for 20–24 h. Cells were then incubated in serum-free DMEM for 2 h prior to addition of agonist. Following stimulation, cells were lysed (according to manufacturer's instructions) and 20 μl of lysate (500 μl total) was assayed for reporter gene expression. Firefly (P. pyralis) and sea pansy (R. reniformis) luciferase activity were assessed by the Dual Luciferase Reagent Assay System. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad reagents. MAPK activity was measured by using the MAPK assay kit from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Endothelial cell monolayers in 100-mm2 culture dishes were treated with or without agonist for the indicated times at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 44 μg/ml PMSF) for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were scraped from dishes, and lysates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and incubated 4 °C for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and precleared supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, lysates were immunoprecipitated with phosphospecific p42/44 MAPK monoclonal antibody at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added and incubated at 4 °C for 2–4 h with gentle rotation. Immunoprecipitates were pelleted, washed twice in lysis buffer, and twice in kinase assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2). Immune complexes were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of Elk-1 fusion protein and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of 30 μl of SDS sample buffer. Samples were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to Duralose membrane, and subsequently incubated with phospho-Elk-1 antibodies. Phosphorylated Elk-1 was determined by the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) method. Endothelial cell monolayers in 100-mm2 culture dishes were treated with agonist for the indicated times at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 44 μg/ml PMSF) for 30 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 15 min) prior to overnight immunoprecipitation with 1 μg/ml antibody (as indicated) at 4 °C. Protein A- or G-agarose beads were added to each sample and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were gently washed three times with wash buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 44 μg/ml PMSF). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Duralose membrane. The membrane was utilized for immunoblotting with indicated antibodies (described below). Endothelial cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12% separating gel under reducing conditions and transferred to Duralose membrane. Membranes were blocked with (5% dry milk in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 h at 22 °C. Membranes were incubated with indicated primary antibody (diluted in blocking buffer) at 22 °C for at least 1 h. Following washes, membranes were incubated at 22 °C with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or mouse antibody. Protein bands were detected by ECL method. The time course of endothelial cell shape change (measured in real time) in response to thrombin was determined according to procedures described by us (25Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In brief, HPAEC were grown to confluence on small gold electrodes (4.9 × 10−4 cm2). Prior to experiments, monolayers were washed two times with serum-free medium and incubated for 2 h in 1% serum-supplemented culture medium. The small and large electrodes were connected to a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier. A constant current of 1 μA was applied by a 1-V, 4000-Hz AC connected serially to a 1-megohm resistor between the small electrode and the larger counter electrode. The voltage change between small electrode and larger counter electrode was continuously monitored by lock-in amplifier, stored, and processed on a computer. The data are presented as change in resistive (in-phase) portion of the impedance normalized to its initial value at time zero as described (25Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25968-25975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Statistical comparisons were made using two-tailed Student's t test. Experimental values were reported as mean ± S.E. Differences in mean values were considered significant at p < 0.05. To determine if PAR-1 activation increases the PAR-1 mRNA levels in endothelial cells, Northern blot analysis was performed on total RNA isolated from agonist-stimulated cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). Confluent endothelial cell monolayers were stimulated for the indicated times with PAR-1 agonists, thrombin, or the 14-amino acid PAR-1 tethered ligand, TRP-14 (12Vu T.K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar). The expression of GAPDH was unaffected by the experimental conditions and was thus used an internal control. In primary cells, the HPAEC, PAR-1/GAPDH ratio increased 2-fold (over untreated controls) after thrombin treatment (Fig. 1A). This increase was sustained through 6 h of thrombin treatment. A similar response was observed with thrombin treatment of HMEC (Fig. 1B). Stimulation of HPAEC with TRP-14 also increased PAR-1/GAPDH 1.9-fold by 6 h (Fig. 1C). To explore the induction of PAR-1 gene, the PAR-1 promoter reporter plasmid (PAR-1/Luc) and TK/pRL (see “Experimental Procedures”) were transiently expressed in HMEC. Cells were challenged with either thrombin or TRP-14 for various times and lysed, and luciferase activity was measured (see “Experimental Procedures”). Luciferase activity significantly increased over basal at 2 h after thrombin stimulation. By 4–6 h of thrombin exposure, luciferase levels were ∼3-fold greater than in untreated cells. After 10 h of thrombin exposure, luciferase activity showed a downward trend (Fig. 2). Exposure of reporter plasmid-transfected HMEC with different concentrations of thrombin ranging from 10 nm to 300 nm did not alter the expression of reporter (data not shown). Luciferase activity (Fig. 2) and PAR-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 1) were increased over a similar time course with maximal gene expression occurring between 3 and 6 h. To determine whether PAR-1 activation itself is sufficient to induce the PAR-1 gene, HMEC transfected with the reporter plasmid were exposed to TRP-14. Luciferase activity increased >2.5-fold over basal after 4 h of 100 mm TRP-14 stimulation, indicating that activation of endothelial cell surface PAR-1 is responsible for the induction of PAR-1 gene expression. To determine the role of Gi in thrombin-mediated PAR-1 gene induction, HMEC expressing the reporter construct were pretreated with pertussis toxin (PTX) to uncouple PAR-1 from PTX-sensitive G proteins. PTX pretreatment prevented the increase in luciferase activity by 90%, following thrombin stimulation (Fig. 3). Basal luciferase levels were not altered by PTX pretreatment. Thus, PTX-sensitive G proteins are critically involved in mediating thrombin-induced PAR-1 gene expression. The interface between the Gα subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins and cytosolic domains of heptahelical receptors are potential targets for interrupting agonist-mediated signaling events (23Gilchrist A. Mazzoni M.R. Dineen B. Dice A. Linden J. Proctor W.R. Lupica C.R. Dunwiddie T.V. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14912-14919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).2To address further the role of Gi, we determined whether a Gαi-peptide antagonist interferes with thrombin-mediated PAR-1 expression. We transfected plasmids encoding a peptide corresponding to the COOH terminus of Gαi to disrupt the G protein-receptor interaction (23Gilchrist A. Mazzoni M.R. Dineen B. Dice A. Linden J. Proctor W.R. Lupica C.R. Dunwiddie T.V. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14912-14919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).2 Expression of the Gαi antagonist peptide inhibited thrombin-induced PAR-1 expression (Fig. 4A). Overexpression of a scrambled peptide of the same amino acid composition did not alter luciferase expression following thrombin treatment. These results combined with the inhibitory effect of PTX on PAR-1 gene expression indicate the involvement of Gi-PAR-1 coupling in mediating thrombin-induced PAR-1 gene induction. Receptors coupled to PTX-sensitive Gi proteins have been shown to activate downstream signal transduction pathways in both α and βγ subunit-dependent manner (14Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 15Van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 27Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To address if α or βγ subunits coupling to PAR-1 is responsible for downstream signaling, we co-expressed a constitutively active Gαi2 mutant (Gi2-Q205L) or βγ subunits with reporter construct in HMEC. Expression of mutant Gαi2increased reporter activity 3–4-fold over basal values (Fig. 4B), suggesting the involvement of PTX-sensitive G proteins in the thrombin-induced PAR-1 gene induction. Co-expression of plasmids encoding the Gβ1- and Gγ2-isoforms along with luciferase-reporter construct induced PAR-1 gene expression in the absence of thrombin treatment (Fig. 4C). However, neither Gβ1 nor Gγ2 alone induced PAR-1 gene expression. Further, we co-expressed the Gβγ sequesters such as G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) and transducin with the luciferase-reporter construct (28Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lustig K.D. Conklin B.R. Herzmark P. Taussig R. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13900-13905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-expression of either GRK2 or transducin with the PAR-1 reporter construct markedly reduced thrombin-induced PAR-1 expression (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that Gαiactivation mediates thrombin-induced PAR-1 expression by Gβγ dissociation from the ligand-activated Gαi. Because MAPK regulates gene transcription (30Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), we determined if MAPK contributes to the downstream signaling required for PAR-1 gene expression. Thrombin exposure in HMEC caused a rapid and transient phosphorylation of MAPK, which was maximal at 2 min (Fig. 5A). Pretreatment of HMEC with PTX prevented the thrombin-induced MAPK phosphorylation at 2 min (Fig. 5B). However, PTX pretreatment did not inhibit the phosphorylation of MAPK by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Activation of MAPK was also measured by its ability to phosphorylate Elk-1 in vitro (see details under Experimental Procedures“) as the phosphorylation of Ser-383 on Elk-1 by MAPK is required for Elk-1-dependent gene transcription (31Graves J.D. Campbell J.S. Krebs E.G. Annu. Rev. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; : 320-343Google Scholar). We showed that PTX pretreatment prevented the MAPK-mediated Elk-1 phosphorylation after thrombin stimulation. In contrast, basic fibroblast growth factor-mediated Elk-1 phosphorylation was PTX-insensitive (Fig. 5C). Thus, activation of Gi/o mediated the thrombin-induced MAPK phosphorylation and activation of MAPK. To address the role of Ras and Ras-activated pathway in thrombin-induced PAR-1 gene expression, luciferase-reporter constructs were co-expressed with dominant-negative Ras (N17Ras) in HMEC. In N17Ras-expressing HMEC, PAR-1 driven luciferase activity was reduced by 51% following thrombin treatment (Fig. 6A). Moreover, the oncogenic form of Ras, V12Ras, activated PAR-1 gene transcription independent of stimulation by thrombin (Fig. 6A). Since an immediate downstream target of Ras is the serine/threonine kinase Raf, we tested the ability of CAAX-Raf, which constitutively localizes to the cytosolic face of plasma membrane, to induce PAR-1 gene transcription. In this experiment, the luciferase activity increased >2-fold in HMEC overexpressing CAAX-Raf (Fig. 6A). As a known substrate for Raf kinase is the MAPK kina"

We show here that Ure2p is a soluble protein that can assemble into fibers that are similar to the fibers observed in the case of PrP in its scrapie prion filaments form or that form on Sup35 self-assembly. Ure2p self-assembly is a cooperative process where one can distinguish a lag phase followed by an elongation phase preceding a plateau. A combination of size exclusion chromatography, sedimentation velocity, and electron microscopy demonstrates that the soluble form of Ure2p consists at least of three forms of the protein as follows: a monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric form whose abundance is concentration-dependent. By the use of limited proteolysis, intrinsic fluorescence, and circular dichroism measurements, we bring strong evidence for the existence of at least two structural domains in Ure2p molecules. Indeed, Ure2p NH2-terminal region is found poorly structured, whereas its COOH-terminal domain appears to be compactly folded.

Cell. 1997; 89: 495-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10Wickner R.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 109-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This change in yeast cell phenotypes could lead to an evolutionary advantage under certain conditions, e.g.giving rise to new proteins due to a readthrough of a stop codon (in case of the aggregation of Sup35p, known to be a translation termination factor (see Refs. 9Lindquist S. Cell. 1997; 89: 495-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar and 11Kushnirov V.V. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)), or allow the uptake of both poor and rich nitrogen sources as happens in case of the Ure2p aggregation (Ure2p is a transcriptional factor, regulator of nitrogen metabolism in yeast (12Lacroute F.

Biol. 1991; 11: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar)).It is now widely accepted that formation of insoluble aggregates is a result of a shift in equilibrium between native soluble conformer of a prion protein and aggregation-competent molecules (6Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 793-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Although reasons for such a shift are rather obscure, the basis for partitioning between different conformers seems to be provided (at least in case of mammalian prion proteins) by their specific structural properties (4Prusiner S.B. Science. 1997; 278: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar,14Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K.

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13452-13457Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent structural studies demonstrated that mammalian prion proteins possess a large unstructured NH2-terminal part (14Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 15Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13452-13457Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Since synthetic peptides reproducing various regions in this domain are capable of polymerizing into amyloid fibrils (for review see Ref. 16Mihara H. Takahashi Y. Ueno A. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), this part of the molecule has been suggested to govern PrP aggregation. The most widely accepted model for amyloid formation hypothesizes that primary conformational changes affect the NH2-terminal domain of PrP and then propagate to the rest of the molecule with an efficiency depending on the local structural properties of different PrP isoforms (4Prusiner S.B. Science. 1997; 278: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 6Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 793-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar).In order to understand better the features that can provide the basis for possible structural plasticity of the yeast prion-like protein Ure2, we have attempted its purification and characterization (after overexpression in Escherichia coli cells). Our data demonstrate that recombinant Ure2p is a soluble monomeric protein that can self-associate into dimers, tetramers, as well as insoluble high molecular weight oligomers. These high molecular weight oligomers are fibrillar structures that appear, when examined in the electron microscope, to be very similar to the fibers that are observed in the case of PrP in its scrapie prion filaments form or that form on Sup35 self-assembly. Ure2p oligomerization is a cooperative process that is concentration-dependent. Finally, Ure2p fibers bind Congo Red as do amyloid fibers. We also bring evidence in this work for the existence of at least two structural domains in Ure2p molecules and show that only slight conformational changes accompany Ure2p aggregation. These changes affect essentially the COOH-terminal part of the molecule.DISCUSSIONYeast prions Sup35 and Ure2p do not kill the cells that harbor them and are not hazardous nor pathogenic for humans. They present, therefore, a useful model system to study the molecular mechanisms of mammalian prions advent and spread. Our capacity to express recombinant yeast prion Ure2p as a soluble protein allowed us to characterize some of its properties. The work presented here provides new insights into the structure of this protein and the mechanism of its assembly into various quaternary structures.Structure of Ure2pSoluble Ure2p was found to emerge from a sizing column with an apparent molecular mass of 130,000 incompatible with that expected for a monomeric Ure2p molecule that would have a globular shape. Sedimentation velocity measurements reveal that recombinant Ure2p forms oligomers in a concentration-dependent manner. Indeed, soluble Ure2p preparations are heterogeneous mixtures of monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric Ure2p molecules as well as higher order oligomers. Examination of soluble Ure2p preparations by electron microscopy reveals globular but heterogeneous particles. The most striking structures we observed were ring-shaped particles with an outer diameter of 10 nm composed of four arrowheads pointed toward the center of the particles. The finding that Ure2p oligomerization is concentration-dependent indicates that the monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric forms of Ure2p as well as the higher molecular weight oligomers are in equilibrium. Over 95% of the soluble form of Ure2p was found to assemble into insoluble high molecular weight oligomers either upon incubation of the protein for prolonged periods at 4 or 28 °C or adjustment of the pH of the solution from 7.5 to 6.5. In the latter case fibrillar structures highly heterogeneous in size and shape were obtained while fibrils that are 15–20 nm wide varying in length between 0.5 and 10 μm were obtained upon incubation of the soluble form of Ure2p at either 4 or 28 °C. These fibers appear very similar in the electron microscope to PrP scrapie-associated filaments and to the fibers observed upon Sup35 autoassembly and bind Congo Red which is a characteristic of amyloid fibers.The kinetics of Ure2p assembly are sigmoidal indicating a cooperative process. Furthermore, the lag phase preceding Ure2p assembly depends on the concentration of the protein and disappears upon addition of preformed Ure2p fibers to the soluble form of the proteins which indicates that Ure2p autoassembly is a nucleated process. Finally, the critical concentration for Ure2p assembly appears to be lower than 0.5 μm since the proportion of protein assembled into fibers represents 95% of the input soluble Ure2p (10 μm). Taken together, the properties of Ure2p in vitro can account for the propagation of Ure2p polymers in a manner similar to what occurs in the case of Sup 35 and PrP.Conformational Changes of Ure2pSeveral genetic studies suggest that Ure2p is a two-domain protein that were recently shown by means of the two-hybrid system to interact with each other (38Fernandez-Bellot E. Guillemet E. Baudin-Baillieu A. Gaumer S. Komar A.A. Cullin C. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Indeed, the NH2-terminal third of the molecule appears essential for the occurrence of [URE3] phenotype, whereas the catalytic activity of the protein appears to be located in the COOH-terminal two-thirds of the molecule (10Wickner R.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 109-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 39Masison D.C. Maddelein M.L. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12503-12508Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Secondary structure calculation algorithms predict that most of the NH2-terminal third of the protein is unstructured (i.e. essentially constituted by coils, turns, and sheets), whereas the α-helical structures are mainly located in the COOH-terminal two-thirds of the protein. Thus Ure2p is predicted to be at least a two-domain protein. These predictions are supported by the data obtained upon treatment of the COOH- and NH2-terminal domains of the protein, expressed independently, with different proteases. Ure2p NH2-terminal domain showed a much higher sensitivity to protease treatments than the COOH-terminal domain of the protein. Indeed, none of the peptides generated upon protease treatment of the NH2-terminal domain resisted longer than 1 min, whereas the products of Ure2p COOH-terminal domain cleavage were stable for over 1 h. These studies revealed two fragments (22 and 14.5 kDa) highly resistant to proteinase K as well as two others (29 and 7 kDa) highly resistant to trypsin. These peptides were tentatively identified as a breakdown products of Ure2p COOH-terminal domain since they are generated upon treatment of Ure2p 94–354 fragment by the same proteases. The largest peptide (29 kDa) would correspond to Ure2p COOH-terminal domain devoid of its 8–11 NH2-terminal amino acid residues or to the same domain devoid of its 10 COOH-terminal amino acid residues. Confirmation of the assignment will ultimately require the isolation and sequencing of the 29-kDa fragment. The same approach will lead to assignment of the 22-, 14.5-, and 7-kDa fragments.A major conformational change occurring upon Ure2p aggregation would result in differences in the digestion profiles of the two forms of the protein. This is not what we observed. Indeed, treatment of full-length Ure2p in its soluble or aggregated forms by proteinase K or trypsin yielded peptides that are identical to that generated upon treatment of Ure2p COOH-terminal domain by the same proteases. However, the kinetics of cleavage were significantly slower for the insoluble form of Ure2p. Such results are what one expects in the case of a reduced accessibility of Ure2p (the substrate) to the protease. Furthermore, the peptides generated upon either proteinase K or trypsin treatments of full-length Ure2p were that generated upon treatment of the COOH-terminal domain of Ure2p by the same proteases. This strongly suggests that the NH2-terminal domain is rapidly degraded whether or not the COOH-terminal domain is present. The rapid and total degradation of Ure2p NH2-terminal domain would be a consequence of its lack of structure and compactness. Finally, our findings also indicate that the COOH-terminal domain adopts the same conformation in the presence or absence of the NH2-terminal domain, since the same protease cleavage sites are exposed whether the NH2-terminal domain of the protein is present or not.Proteolytic treatment of proteins is a powerful tool to probe conformational changes that may affect the structure of the substrate polypeptides. Nevertheless, a number of tiny changes may well be overlooked. In order to detect such small changes, intrinsic fluorescence as well as circular dichroism measurements were carried out. Given that all tryptophan and tyrosine residues are located within Ure2p COOH-terminal domain, intrinsic fluorescence measurements allowed us to follow conformational changes affecting this domain of the protein. The data presented in this work clearly demonstrate that the COOH-terminal domain of Ure2p undergoes a conformational change during self-assembly process that results in a 50% decrease in exposure of tyrosine and tryptophan residues to water concomitant with a shift in the wavelength of the emission maximum. Circular dichroism data suggest that a number of amino acid residues in Ure2p are in α-helical structures. The amount of α-helices increases when the protein is in the presence of TFE, a solvent known to stabilize α-helical structure. This could be due to the transition of stretches of amino acid residues in Ure2p NH2-terminal domain from random coils to α-helical structures. Alternatively, the increase of the content of α-helices could correspond to amino acid residues located within the COOH-terminal moiety of the protein that adopts a structure predominantly α-helical upon TFE addition. Consequently, methods allowing the specific labeling of the Ure2p NH2-terminal domain with extrinsic fluorophores will have to be designed in order to access the effect of the solvent as well as autoassembly on the flexibility of this domain.Present genetic, biochemical, and structural data (3Horwich A.L.

In all cases proteins seem to consist of at least two major parts. Indeed, although the NH2-terminal part (bearing unusual amino acids repeats, rich in Gly in the case of PrP (4Prusiner S.B.

We show here that Ure2p like Sup35 and PrPc can undergo extensive aggregation into highly ordered fibers. Our data demonstrate that preformed Ure2p fibers incorporate the soluble form of the protein and propagate Ure2p assembly in a manner similar to what is observed in the case of Sup35 (32Glover J.R.

This characteristic is common among PrPc, Sup35, as well as Ure2p. Nevertheless, such conformational changes are not necessarily restricted to the NH2-terminal part of these proteins. Indeed, the majority of the mutations affecting the efficiency of propagation of prion diseases is associated with the COOH-terminal part of the protein (4Prusiner S.B.

Such aggregates reveal high resistance to proteases, thus escaping different common degradation pathways, e.g.proteosomal complexes (7Mayer A. Siegel N.R. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A.

In contrast to mammalian prions, which in their aggregated form significantly damage the cells (leading finally to cell death), the so-called yeast prion-like proteins (Sup35p and Ure2p, when thought to be aggregated) do not damage yeast cells but do, however, change their phenotypes (9Lindquist S.

This change in yeast cell phenotypes could lead to an evolutionary advantage under certain conditions, e.g.giving rise to new proteins due to a readthrough of a stop codon (in case of the aggregation of Sup35p, known to be a translation termination factor (see Refs. 9Lindquist S.

It is now widely accepted that formation of insoluble aggregates is a result of a shift in equilibrium between native soluble conformer of a prion protein and aggregation-competent molecules (6Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 793-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Although reasons for such a shift are rather obscure, the basis for partitioning between different conformers seems to be provided (at least in case of mammalian prion proteins) by their specific structural properties (4Prusiner S.B.

https://openalex.org/W1596063300,"The present study shows that melatonin prevents, within the first cell cycle, the estradiol-induced growth of synchronized MCF7 breast cancer cells. By using nuclear extracts of these cells, we first examined the binding of estradiol-estrogen receptor complexes to estrogen-responsive elements and found that the addition of estradiol to whole cells activates the binding of the estrogen receptor to DNA whereas melatonin blocks this interaction. By contrast, melatonin neither affects the binding of estradiol to its receptor nor the receptor nuclear localization. Moreover, we also show that addition of estradiol to nuclear extracts stimulates the binding of estrogen receptor to DNA, but this activation is also prevented by melatonin. The inhibitory effect caused by melatonin is saturable at nanomolar concentrations and does not appear to be mediated by RZR nuclear receptors. The effect is also specific, since indol derivatives do not cause significant inhibition. Furthermore, we provide evidence that melatonin does not interact with the estrogen receptor in the absence of estradiol. Together, these results demonstrate that melatonin interferes with the activation of estrogen receptor by estradiol. The effect of melatonin suggests the presence of a receptor that, upon melatonin addition, destabilizes the binding of the estradiol-estrogen receptor complex to the estrogen responsive element."
https://openalex.org/W1605079513,"Previous data have suggested that glucocorticoids (GCs) are involved in the differentiation of thymocytes into mature T cells. In this report we demonstrate that the mouse thymic epithelial cells (TEC) express the cytochrome P450 hydroxylases Cyp11A1, Cyp21, and Cyp11B1. These enzymes, in combination with 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3betaHSD), convert cholesterol into corticosterone, the major GC in rodents. In addition, when TEC were cocultured with 'reporter cells' containing the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and a GR-dependent reporter gene, a specific induction of reporter gene activity was observed. Induction of reporter gene activity was blocked when the TEC and reporter cells were incubated in the presence of the Cyp11B1 inhibitor metyrapone or the 3betaHSD inhibitor trilostane, as well as by the GR antagonist RU486. Coculturing of TEC with thymocytes induced apoptosis in the latter, which was partially blocked by the enzyme inhibitors and RU486. We conclude that TEC secrete a GC hormone activity and suggest a paracrine role for this in thymocyte development."
https://openalex.org/W1971084473,"The Janus family of tyrosine kinases (JAKs) plays a critical role in signal transduction by members of the cytokine receptor superfamily.

Tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAK) 1The abbreviation used is: JAK, Janus tyrosine kinase; TPO, thrombopoietin; IL, interleukin; hSIE, human Sis-inducible element; PRE, prolactin response element. is an essential element of signal transduction by all members of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family (reviewed in Refs. 1Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar and 2Ihle J.N. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). There are four members of the Janus kinase family (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2), cytoplasmic proteins that associate with the intracellular portion of cytokine receptors via conserved box 1 and box 2 motifs in the membrane-proximal portion of the receptor. The box 1 motif is defined by two characteristically spaced prolines (PXXP) located within 30 residues of the transmembrane domain (3Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Box 2 is usually located 35–60 residues downstream of the transmembrane domain, and contains 12–18 residues, rich in glutamic acid and serine (3Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). It is likely that the specificity of JAK-receptor interactions is mediated through these regions, although no definitive JAK binding motifs have been recognized. Ligand binding leads to receptor multimerization and permits trans-phosphorylation and activation of the associated kinases. The utilization of a specific JAK or pair of JAKs is characteristic of each receptor (reviewed in Refs. 1Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 4Leaman D.W.

Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thrombopoietin (TPO), the primary regulator of platelet production (6Kaushansky K. Broudy V.C. Lin N. Jorgensen M.J. McCarty J. Fox N. Zucker-Franklin D. Lofton-Day C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3234-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), is structurally and functionally related to a large family of hormones, cytokines, and interleukins. Upon binding to its receptor, Mpl, TPO is believed to induce receptor homodimerization. This hypothesis is supported by the absence of interaction with the known common signaling subunits (gp130, IL-2-R-γ, and the common β-chain of the GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 receptors) as well as reports that Mpl homodimerization is sufficient for signaling (7Broudy V.C.

Blau C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8093-8097Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In general, homodimeric receptors utilize a single JAK (e.g. erythropoietin and prolactin receptors utilize JAK2), whereas heterodimeric (or heterotrimeric) receptors require two distinct JAKs (e.g. interferon-α uses JAK1 and TYK2; interferon-γ uses JAK1 and JAK2) (reviewed in Ref. 12Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Thus, it was surprising when several reports demonstrated that TPO induces phosphorylation of two distinct Janus family members, JAK2 and TYK2. This has been observed both in cell lines engineered to express the Mpl receptor (13Sattler M. Durstin M.A. Frank D.A. Okuda K. Kaushansky K. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 1040-1048PubMed Google Scholar, 14Morita H. Tahara T. Matsumoto A. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Ohashi H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) as well as human platelets (15Ezumi Y. Takayama H. Okuma M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which likely represent a more physiologically relevant environment. Others have shown that, of the four Janus kinases, only JAK2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to TPO (16Mu S.X. Xia M. Elliott G. Bogenberger J. Swift S. Bennett L. Lappinga D.L. Hecht R. Lee R. Saris C.J. Blood. 1995; 86: 4532-4543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tortolani P.J. Johnston J.A. Bacon C.M. McVicar D.W. Shimosaka A. Linnekin D. Longo D.L. O'Shea J.J. Blood. 1995; 85: 3444-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we reported that there was a difference in JAK phosphorylation between cell lines and purified, primary megakaryocytes. Whereas cell lines, which proliferate in response to TPO, demonstrated abundant JAK2 and TYK2 phosphorylation after TPO stimulation, mature megakaryocytes contained primarily JAK2 phosphorylation; TYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation was barely detectable (18Drachman J.G. Sabath D.F. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1997; 89: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This raised several important questions about the earliest events during TPO signaling. Are JAK2 and TYK2 both essential for Mpl signaling? What would be the consequence if JAK2 or TYK2 were absent during TPO/Mpl signaling? To address these questions, we utilized human sarcoma cells that were originally selected on the basis of their failure to transduce an interferon-specific signal. These cells were found to lack normal expression of either JAK2 (γ2A) or TYK2 (U1A) and interfere with interferon-γ or interferon-α signaling, respectively (12Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). These cells have previously been used to demonstrate that although IL-6 stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of three distinct Janus kinases (JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2), JAK1 is most important for activation of downstream signaling molecules (19Guschin D. Rogers N. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B. Watling D. Horn F. Pellegrini S. Yasukawa K. Heinrich P. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Based on this strategy, we engineered each of these cell lines and the corresponding parental cells to express the full-length murine Mpl receptor and then assessed the ability of TPO to initiate signal transduction. Our results demonstrate that JAK2, but not TYK2, is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of Mpl, STAT3, and Shc. This suggests that TYK2 phosphorylation, although readily detected in various cell lines, is not an essential step in TPO signaling. Dependence on a single Janus kinase is consistent with our understanding of homodimeric receptors. Monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) and polyclonal antiserum against JAK2 and Shc were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and polyclonal antiserum against TYK2 and STAT3 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antiserum against Mpl was generously provided by Zymogenetics (Seattle, WA). Human sarcoma cell lines were generously provided by George Stark (Cleveland Clinic, OH) and were each maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% heat-inactivated calf serum, antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, fungizone), and l-glutamine. 2C4 (parental) and γ2A (JAK2 deficient) lines were grown in the presence of hygromycin, 250 micrograms/ml (Sigma). U1A (TYK2-deficient) cells were selected in neomycin, 1 mg/ml (Sigma). 2C4 and γ2A were transfected with a murine Mpl expression vector (pCDNA3-mMpl) by the method of calcium phosphate precipitation. Neomycin-resistant clones were selected by addition of 1 mg/ml G418 and then tested for Mpl expression by Western blot (Fig. 1) and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (data not shown). U1A cells were simultaneously transfected with pCDNA3-Mpl and pCMV ouabain, a ouabain resistance plasmid (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), and clones were selected by addition of 1 μm ouabain (Sigma) to the culture media. Expression of Mpl was confirmed as above. When 15-cm tissue culture dishes contained a nearly confluent cellular monolayer, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated 12–16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin, antibiotics, and l-glutamine. Matched plates were either unstimulated or exposed for 10 min to 15 ng/ml murine TPO (produced as conditioned media by TPO-secreting baby hamster kidney cells). Cells were scraped off the dishes with rubber spatulas and resuspended at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (pH 7.4, 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). After 10 min (4 °C, occasional vortexing), the particulate material was removed by centrifugation (12,000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the cleared lysates were stored at −70 °C until use. Protein concentrations of lysates were determined by modified Lowry assay (D/C Protein Assay, Bio-Rad); 1 mg of total protein was used for each immunoprecipitation. The appropriate antibody was added (2.0 μg or 2.0 μl if concentration not available), the volume was adjusted to 1 ml using fresh lysis buffer, and the reactions were gently mixed at 4 °C for 2 h. Twenty-five μl of protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added for an additional 1-h incubation at 4 °C. The beads were then collected by centrifugation, washed three times in cold lysis buffer, and then boiled in sample loading buffer, containing 2% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were loaded onto 7.5% acrylamide Laemmli mini-gels with prestained molecular weight markers (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). Protein was electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose which was then blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and 3% bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies were used according to manufacturer recommendations at room temperature for 2 h. The membrane was washed three times with TBST (5 min per wash) then incubated with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for 30 min. After three washes in TBST at 5 min each, chemiluminescent reagents (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added for 1 min and the membranes were exposed to x-ray film for 10–90 s. The nitrocellulose was stripped prior to reprobing by incubating at 50 °C for 30 min in 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 100 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS. The humanSis Inducible Element (hSIE; GATCCATTTCCCGTAAATCGATC), a STAT3-specific double-stranded DNA sequence, was used as a probe for active STAT3 (20Tweardy D.J. Wright T.M. Ziegler S.F. Baumann H. Chakraborty A. White S.M. Dyer K.F. Rubin K.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 4409-4416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TheProlactin Response Element (PRE; GATCAGATTTCTAGGAATTCAAATCGATC) was used as a probe for STAT5-specific binding activity (20Tweardy D.J. Wright T.M. Ziegler S.F. Baumann H. Chakraborty A. White S.M. Dyer K.F. Rubin K.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 4409-4416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The probes were radiolabeled as described previously (18Drachman J.G. Sabath D.F. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1997; 89: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were separated from unincorporated [32P]ATP using Centri-Sep columns (Princeton Separations, Princeton, New Jersey). Detergent-free lysates were prepared from unstimulated or TPO-stimulated cells as described previously (18Drachman J.G. Sabath D.F. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1997; 89: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a final volume of 10 μl, 10 μg of protein were combined with 4 μg of poly(dI·dC), binding buffer (final concentrations: 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.9; 125 mm NaCl; 8% glycerol; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.15 mm EDTA), and the radiolabeled hSIE probe (0.6 pmol). After a 20-min incubation (22 °C), the total volume was subjected to electrophoresis on a nondenaturing gel (4% acrylamide; 5% glycerol; 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer), using 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA as the running buffer. When the unbound probe had run into the buffer, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film overnight to detect retarded bands. Parental cells (2C4/mMpl) or those deficient in either JAK2 (γ2A/mMpl) or TYK2 (U1A/mMpl) were either unstimulated or exposed to TPO as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Anti-Mpl antiserum was then used to immunoprecipitate the receptor from whole cellular lysates; at least two independent clones of each cell type were used. Immunoblotting with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (4G10) was done to detect TPO-induced Mpl phosphorylation (Fig. 1). We found that the cells with all JAKs present as well as those lacking TYK2 expression were able to phosphorylate Mpl, whereas JAK2-deficient cells were unable to phosphorylate Mpl. We next wished to examine which of these cell lines sustained TPO-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and TYK2. First, JAK2 was immunoprecipitated from lysates derived from each cell line either before or after TPO stimulation. These samples were analyzed by Western blot and probed to detect phosphotyrosine incorporation (Fig. 2A). We found that the parental cell lines (2C4-Mpl) demonstrated JAK2 phosphorylation after TPO stimulation, and those cell lines lacking JAK2 expression (γ2A-Mpl) had neither phosphorylation nor detectable protein (Fig. 2A, lower strip). However, cell lines deficient in TYK2 expression (U1A-Mpl) retained JAK2 phosphorylation, suggesting that JAK2 activation occurred upstream or independent of TYK2. Similarly, immunoprecipitations were carried out with a TYK2-specific antibody to determine which cells could support TPO-induced phosphorylation of TYK2. Western blots were again probed with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (Fig. 2B). Despite a low level of constitutive TYK2 phosphorylation, a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in the TPO-stimulated parental cells (2C4-Mpl). As expected, the TYK2-deficient cell lines (U1A-Mpl) had neither detectable TYK2 phosphorylation nor protein. Notably, the JAK2-deficient cell lines (γ2A-Mpl) displayed only low level basal phosphorylation of TYK2, which was not increased by TPO stimulation. This result demonstrates that TPO-induced TYK2 phosphorylation requires JAK2 activity. We next studied which JAK(s) were required for phosphorylation of several downstream signaling proteins. The adapter protein Shc that binds to a phosphotyrosine residue in the carboxyl terminus of Mpl (21Alexander W.S. Maurer A.B. Novak U. Harrison-Smith M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6531-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) is believed to be directly phosphorylated by JAKs and may play a critical role in TPO-dependent development (21Alexander W.S. Maurer A.B. Novak U. Harrison-Smith M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6531-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Hill R.J. Zozulya S. Lu Y.L. Hollenbach P.W. Joyce Shaikh B. Bogenberger J. Gishizky M.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1125-1134PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis demonstrated that the phosphorylation of all three Shc isoforms occurred in the absence of TYK2 but was not detectable in lysates from JAK2-deficient cells (Fig. 3A). In many cell lines and human platelets, both STAT3 and STAT5 are directly tyrosine phosphorylated and activated by Janus kinases (11Jin L. Siritanaratkul N. Emery D.W. Richard R.E. Kaushansky K.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), but in murine megakaryocytes, STAT5 activation is minimal (18Drachman J.G. Sabath D.F. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1997; 89: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using lysates from these cell lines, STAT3 was immunoprecipitated and tested for TPO-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blot. As for Shc and Mpl, STAT3 phosphorylation was dependent on functional JAK2 protein but not TYK2 (Fig. 3B). To further demonstrate that Mpl was capable of mediating increased STAT3 DNA binding activity, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed (Fig. 4). Using the STAT3-specific probe hSIE, TPO-dependent STAT3 binding was seen in the parental and TYK2 nullizygous cells, but not in the JAK2-deficient cells (Fig. 4A). Although STAT5 was readily detected by immunoblotting (data not shown), there was no activation of STAT5 binding activity in any of these cells (Fig. 4B), a pattern of signaling reminiscent of that observed in primary megakaryocytes (18Drachman J.G. Sabath D.F. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1997; 89: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prove that JAK2 was essential for TPO-signaling, we expressed wild-type JAK2 in γ2A/Mpl cells (JAK2-deficient) by transfecting them with the expression vector pCDNA3.1(Zeo)-JAK2 (JAK2 cDNA kindly provided by Stuart Frank, Birmingham, AL and James Ihle, Memphis, TN). Cells resistant to Zeocin (500 μg/ml, Invitrogen) were screened for JAK2 expression by Western blot and then tested for TPO-induced phosphorylation of Mpl. When Mpl was immunoprecipitated from γ2A-Mpl and γ2A-Mpl/JAK2 cells, TPO-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor was restored in the cells expressing functional JAK2 (Fig. 5). It is generally accepted that the activation of Janus kinases in response to ligand binding is essential for signal transduction within the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family. For the interferon-α and interferon-γ receptors, two distinct JAKs are required for signal transduction (4Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 5Briscoe J. Guschin D. Rogers N.C. Watling D. Muller M. Horn F. Heinrich P. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.

Studies with the IL-6 receptor indicate that, although three different JAKs are tyrosine phosphorylated after ligand binding, only JAK1 is essential for downstream events (19Guschin D. Rogers N. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B. Watling D. Horn F. Pellegrini S. Yasukawa K. Heinrich P. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Similarly, it was demonstrated that, although epidermal growth factor stimulation activates JAK1, the resulting activation of STAT proteins and induction of c-fos depends only on the intrinsic epidermal growth factor receptor kinase activity (24Leaman D.W. Pisharody S. Flickinger T.W. Commane M.A. Schlessinger J. Kerr I.M. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Thus, the functional role played by tyrosine kinases cannot be predicted simply by studying the state of phosphorylation or activation. Also, the receptor cytoplasmic domain exhibits specificity regarding which JAKs are recruited to the cell membrane and then activated through receptor subunit aggregation. One previous study described a mutant form of Mpl that supports TPO-dependent proliferation without phosphorylation of any JAKs, albeit requiring a much higher concentration of TPO (25Dorsch M. Fan P.D. Danial N.N. Rothman P.B. Goff S.P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1947-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, other reports suggest that mutations leading to the loss of JAK activation result in nonfunctional receptors (14Morita H. Tahara T. Matsumoto A. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Ohashi H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Wojchowski D.M. Baumann H. Gearing D.P. Blood. 1995; 86: 557-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that additional tyrosine kinase families may be activated by TPO stimulation (29Yamashita Y. Miyazato A. Shimizu R. Komatsu N. Miura Y. Ozawa K. Mano H. Exp. Hematol. 1997; 25: 211-216PubMed Google Scholar). At present, however, the role of tyrosine kinases other than JAKs has not been defined. The sarcoma cell lines used in these studies are cytokine-independent and highly primed for autonomous proliferation. Thus, it was not possible to distinguish a proliferative response to TPO in these cell lines (data not shown). Furthermore, as transformed fibroblasts, there was no evident differentiation when grown in TPO for up to 1 week. Specifically, the cells remained adherent with no alteration in morphology or size (data not shown). Nevertheless, the reported data clearly establish that JAK2 is essential for activation of all of the tested secondary molecules implicated in TPO-induced signaling. In both hematopoietic cell lines and human platelets, JAK2 and TYK2 are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to TPO stimulation. To understand how TPO and Mpl might activate two distinct JAK kinases, we constructed three possible models of the active signaling complex. First, the homodimeric receptor may associate with only one JAK, and the other family member may be phosphorylated as a downstream or incidental event (Fig. 6A). Second, both JAK2 and TYK2 may be able to bind to the box 1/box 2 motifs of Mpl and function interchangeably during TPO signaling (Fig. 6B). Third, there may be another, as yet unidentified, receptor subunit that specifically binds the second kinase molecule (Fig. 6C). From each of these models of the active signaling complex, one can predict the effect if one of the two kinases were missing. Inmodel B (center), the two kinases would be redundant, and loss of one or the other might cause little change in signal transduction. In the context of a heterodimeric receptor (model C, right), both JAKs would be necessary to form an active signaling complex, and loss of either one would disrupt signaling. Finally, in model A (left), loss of the JAK that directly binds the receptor would disrupt tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas loss of the downstream kinase might have little or no effect. Our results strongly support the model in Fig. 6A and suggest that JAK2 is essential for TPO-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor (Mpl), both Janus kinases (JAK2 and TYK2), and the downstream effector molecules (STAT3 and Shc). TYK2 is neither sufficient nor necessary for any of these events. Despite the fact that these studies were done in a transformed sarcoma cell system, the early signaling apparatus appears to be intact, and this same system has been used previously to determine the requirements for signal transduction by the interferon, IL-6, and epidermal growth factor receptors (12Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 19Guschin D. Rogers N. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B. Watling D. Horn F. Pellegrini S. Yasukawa K. Heinrich P.

Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results are strengthened by the fact that signal transduction can be restored in the JAK2-deficient cell line by expression of functional JAK2. These data reinforce the recent information obtained from the development of JAK2-deficient mice (30Parganas E. Wang D. Stravopodis D. Topham D.J. Marine J.C. Teglund S. Vanin E.F. Bodner S. Colamonici O.R. van Deursen J.M. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). JAK2 knock-out animals were not viable because of failure of embryonic erythrocyte development. However, study of the fetal liver hematopoietic progenitors demonstrated that JAK2 −/− cells were unresponsive to several cytokines, including erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, interleukin-3, and granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor. However, responses to granulocyte colony stimulating factor, interleukin-6, and interferon-α were unaffected because the corresponding receptors utilize other JAK family members. Thrombopoietin and Mpl, therefore, belong to the subset of cytokine/receptor pairs that absolutely require JAK2 for signaling activity. In contrast, there have been no reports of TYK2 knock-out animals, and data from cell lines as well as human platelets suggested that TYK2 is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to TPO. In this report, we establish that TYK2 is a secondary event in thrombopoietin signaling, downstream of JAK2 activation, and not required for the phosphorylation of other signaling molecules. It is possible that TYK2 is phosphorylated either as a substrate of JAK2 or through receptor cross-talk (i.e. Mpl activation might activate another associated receptor that itself specifically binds TYK2). However, we have previously demonstrated that TYK2 is not phosphorylated to a significant degree in mature murine megakaryocytes (18Drachman J.G. Sabath D.F. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1997; 89: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These combined pieces of evidence strongly suggest that the active signaling complex for TPO and Mpl contains a homodimeric receptor in which each receptor subunit binds an activated JAK2 molecule.

Development of the mammalian palate is a complex process involving the migration and differentiation of neural crest derivatives in the cranial region of the embryo. Palatal structures arise from the first branchial arches, paired swellings of neural crest mesenchyme. The formation of the secondary palate first becomes evident on gestational day (gd) 1The abbreviation used is: gd, gestational day(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PSP, parotid secretory protein.1The abbreviation used is: gd, gestational day(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PSP, parotid secretory protein. 12 in the mouse embryo, with the appearance of the palatal shelves, bilateral growths of tissue extending vertically from the roof of the oronasal cavity along either side of the tongue. The palatal shelves continue to grow in this orientation until gd14, when they become reoriented to lie horizontally above the tongue in a process known as elevation. Following elevation, the opposing shelves contact each other and fuse to form a continuous structure separating the oral and nasal cavities. Disruption of the growth and morphological differentiation of these facial primordia through teratological insult, abnormal gene activity or regulation, or a combination of these factors can lead to palatal malformations, which are a relatively common birth defect in humans.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 304-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) to examine gene expression in the embryonic murine palate. This analysis has led to the identification of a novel gene transcript, expressed peripherally in the palate and quite strongly in the presumptive nasal epithelium of the embryo, with a striking spatially restricted pattern of expression. This transcript also shows strong expression in the adult murine lung. In this study, we describe the identification, expression pattern, and sequence of this novel gene transcript, which we refer to as plunc (palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone).DISCUSSIONplunc is a novel gene transcript with a unique spatial and temporal pattern of expression in the embryonic and adult mouse. Expression in the mouse embryo is first noted on gd14 on or about the time of palatal shelf elevation and fusion and is confined to discrete regions of the nasal epithelium. These regions of expression are associated with the dorsal palate, nasal septum, and nasal conchae. The transcript is also expressed strongly in the tracheal and bronchial epithelium of the adult mouse lung.The discovery of a new gene raises the corresponding question of the function of the gene. Because plunc is expressed only at the margins of the palatal shelves, well removed from the sites of shelf contact and fusion, we think it unlikely that plunc plays a role in this aspect of facial morphogenesis. pluncexpression is, however, associated with areas of presumptive fusion of adjacent epithelia as the nasal columella and lateral nasal walls form the sinus cavities and the common nasal passage. It is possible thatplunc may serve in some regulatory aspect of this morphogenetic event.Examination of the predicted amino acid sequence of theplunc protein indicates that it is a secreted molecule; the related PSP is a major protein component of saliva (11Madsen H.O. Hjorth J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus one alternative hypothesis is that plunc is not a morphogenetic factor but a component of nasal or respiratory mucus. The pseudostratified columnar epithelia of the nasal and respiratory passages are provided with scattered, isolated goblet cells, and subepithelial mucous glands that produce a variety of proteinaceous secretions (23Provenza D.V. Fundamentals of Oral Histology and Embryology. Lippincott, Philadelphia, PA1972Google Scholar). Although plunc is abundantly expressed in certain regions of these epithelia, the in situhybridization signal does not specifically match the distribution of either of these cell types. The fact that plunc transcripts are absent from the smaller respiratory passages and lung alveoli also makes it unlikely that this gene product is a secretion involved in gas exchange (i.e. not a surfactant).The potential relationship between the PSPs and pluncprovides little insight into plunc function, because the functions of the PSPs themselves remain unknown. PSP expression in the murine parotid glands is coordinately regulated with salivary amylase (12Mirels L. Ball W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2679-2687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); whether this indicates that the functions of these proteins are complementary remains to be determined. The reduced expression of the bovine PSP, BSP30, has been linked to resistance to pasture bloat disease in cattle (10Rajan G.H. Morris C.A. Carruthers V.R. Wilkins R.J. Wheeler T.T. Animal Genet. 1996; 27: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Again, the potential significance of this observation for embryonic development and epithelial cell function is unknown. The strict spatial and temporal regulation of expression of both the PSPs and plunc, however, implies that these gene products are important in defining the functions of the expressing tissues.The onset of plunc expression coincides with differentiation of the presumptive nasal epithelium into mature nasal epithelial cells (13Kaufman M.H. The Atlas of Mouse Development. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar). We also note the persistent expression of plunc in the adult nasopharynx as well as the fact that sequence tags with high homology to plunc have been identified in human olfactory epithelium. These observations lead us to speculate that the association of plunc with epithelial cells of the developing palate and nasopharynx may be related to the differentiation and maintenance of an as yet unidentified subpopulation of epithelial cells.In the embryonic and adult nasopharynx, plunc shows a surprisingly discontinuous pattern of expression in a continuous epithelial sheet. Because no obvious histological features distinguish regions of epithelial cells that express plunc from those that do not, the basis for this pattern of expression is unknown. These observations suggest that the nasal epithelium, relatively uniform in appearance, may contain functionally distinct regions defined on the basis of differential gene expression. An examination of the molecular regulation of the plunc transcript should prove useful in testing this hypothesis.Unlike the pattern observed in the nasal epithelium, pluncexpression in the lower respiratory tract is continuous throughout the trachea and upper bronchi. As in the nasopharynx, however, there is no histological demarcation indicating the limit of pluncexpression in the bronchial epithelium. The distinction betweenplunc-expressing and nonexpressing cells may be present only at the molecular level, and it will be interesting to determine whether the same factors that govern plunc expression in the tracheobronchial epithelium also operate in the nasal epithelium.Sequence analysis of plunc also revealed an apparently novel repeating amino acid motif, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu. This repeated sequence is likely to represent the amino terminus of the mature protein following removal of the presumptive signal sequence. Because no other known proteins were found to share this motif, its functional significance here remains speculative. A targeted search for other new proteins that may share this sequence element should be useful in determining whether this sequence serves an important role inplunc function.Our goal in undertaking these studies was to identify candidate genes involved in the control of craniofacial morphogenesis. Althoughplunc is unlikely to play a role in this process, the expression pattern of this novel transcript indicates a previously unsuspected level of complexity in the nasal and respiratory epithelium. Determination of the function of plunc and the mechanisms underlying its highly restricted pattern of expression represent the next steps in determining the regionally specified functions of these tissues.

Because no obvious histological features distinguish regions of epithelial cells that express plunc from those that do not, the basis for this pattern of expression is unknown. These observations suggest that the nasal epithelium, relatively uniform in appearance, may contain functionally distinct regions defined on the basis of differential gene expression. An examination of the molecular regulation of the plunc transcript should prove useful in testing this hypothesis. Unlike the pattern observed in the nasal epithelium, pluncexpression in the lower respiratory tract is continuous throughout the trachea and upper bronchi. As in the nasopharynx, however, there is no histological demarcation indicating the limit of pluncexpression in the bronchial epithelium. The distinction betweenplunc-expressing and nonexpressing cells may be present only at the molecular level, and it will be interesting to determine whether the same factors that govern plunc expression in the tracheobronchial epithelium also operate in the nasal epithelium. Sequence analysis of plunc also revealed an apparently novel repeating amino acid motif, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu. This repeated sequence is likely to represent the amino terminus of the mature protein following removal of the presumptive signal sequence. Because no other known proteins were found to share this motif, its functional significance here remains speculative. A targeted search for other new proteins that may share this sequence element should be useful in determining whether this sequence serves an important role inplunc function. Our goal in undertaking these studies was to identify candidate genes involved in the control of craniofacial morphogenesis. Althoughplunc is unlikely to play a role in this process, the expression pattern of this novel transcript indicates a previously unsuspected level of complexity in the nasal and respiratory epithelium. Determination of the function of plunc and the mechanisms underlying its highly restricted pattern of expression represent the next steps in determining the regionally specified functions of these tissues.

https://openalex.org/W1851414862,"Induction of apoptosis of mononucleated cells is a physiological process for regulating the intensity of the immune response. The female steroid hormones estrogen (E2) and progesterone (Prog) are known to modulate the reactivity of the immune system; recently it has been demonstrated that they can regulate induction of apoptosis of endothelial cells and osteoblasts. TNF-alpha-mediated induction of apoptosis has been well characterized in myeloid cells. We investigated whether E2 and Prog could interfere with TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis of the monoblastoid U937 cell line. Treatment with E2 or Prog increased survival and prevented apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha in both undifferentiated and macrophage-like PMA-differentiated U937 cells, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion cell counting, thymidine incorporation, AnnexinV labeling, followed by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation studies. This effect can be associated with the activation of specific hormone receptors, since we observed the expression of the estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha), ER-beta, and progesterone receptor (PR) mRNAs; the ER-alpha protein expression was confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis. In addition, hormone-mediated survival against apoptosis was concentration dependent, reaching the half-maximal effect at 10 nM and blocked by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 in undifferentiated cells, further supporting a receptor-mediated mechanism of cell survival. Other steroid receptor drugs such as Raloxifene, RU486, or the ICI 182,780 in PMA-differentiated cells displayed agonist activity by preventing TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis as efficiently as the hormones alone, providing further evidence to the notion that steroid receptor drugs may manifest agonist or antagonist activities depending on the cellular context in which they are studied. Treatment with E2 was also associated with a time-dependent decrease in the mRNA level of the proapoptotic Nip-2 protein, supporting the hypothesis that hormone responsiveness of U937 cells is mediated by target gene transcription. Together, these results demonstrate that ER and PR can be activated by endogenous or exogenous ligands to induce a genetic response that impairs TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. The data presented here suggest that the female steroid receptors play a role in regulation of the immune response by preventing apoptosis of monoblastoid cells; this effect might have important consequences in the clinical use of steroid receptor drugs. --Vegeto, E., Pollio, G., Pellicciari, C., Maggi, A.

https://openalex.org/W2023585901,"In this study we show that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) causes a rapid stimulation in glucose uptake by ∼50% in both L6 myotubes and isolated rat skeletal muscle. This activation is mediated via the 5-HT2A receptor, which is expressed in L6, rat, and human skeletal muscle. In L6 cells, expression of the 5-HT2A receptor is developmentally regulated based on the finding that receptor abundance increases by over 3-fold during differentiation from myoblasts to myotubes. Stimulation of the 5-HT2A receptor using methylserotonin (m-HT), a selective 5-HT2A agonist, increased muscle glucose uptake in a manner similar to that seen in response to 5-HT. The agonist-mediated stimulation in glucose uptake was attributable to an increase in the plasma membrane content of GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4. The stimulatory effects of 5-HT and m-HT were suppressed in the presence of submicromolar concentrations of ketanserin (a selective 5-HT2A antagonist) providing further evidence that the increase in glucose uptake was specifically mediated via the 5-HT2A receptor. Treatment of L6 cells with insulin resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1, increased cellular production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-phosphate and a 41-fold activation in protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) activity. In contrast, m-HT did not modulate IRS1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, or PKB activity. The present results indicate that rat and human skeletal muscle both express the 5-HT2A receptor and that 5-HT and specific 5-HT2A agonists can rapidly stimulate glucose uptake in skeletal muscle by a mechanism which does not depend upon components that participate in the insulin signaling pathway.

Serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 1The abbreviation used is: 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; 2DG, 2-deoxy-d-glucose; m-HT, methylserotonin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-phosphate; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B. is a neurotransmitter that has been implicated in the regulation of diverse physiological processes, including cellular growth and differentiation (1Tecott L. Shtrom S. Julius D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), neuronal development (2Eaton M.J. Staley J.K. Globus M.Y.T. Whittemore S.R. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and regulation of blood glucose concentration (3Smith S.A. Pogson C.I. Biochem.

J. 1995; 311: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This functional diversity stems from the ability of the neurotransmitter to interact with multiple 5-HT receptors (currently classified as 5-HT1 through to 5-HT7with further subtypes within each receptor class) that can trigger and activate distinct intracellular signaling systems (5Peroutka S.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 68-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For example, with the exception of the 5-HT3 receptor which operates as a ligand-gated ion channel, all known 5-HT receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors which can, depending on receptor class and subtype, couple negatively or positively to adenylyl cyclase (6Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-203PubMed Google Scholar), modulate ion channel activity (7Nicoll R.A.

Maroteaux L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3141-3147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Of major interest to us, however, has been the observation that administration of 5-HT, 5-HT precursors, or specific 5-HT receptor agonists and antagonists can modulate circulating levels of blood glucose in rodents. While some investigators have reported that 5-HT promotes hyperglycemia by a mechanism that may involve increased renal catecholamine release (11Wozniak K.M. Linnoila M. Life Sci. 1991; 49: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), there is a prevailing view that blood glucose is lowered by 5-HT and that this response can be suppressed by 5-HT receptor antagonists (3Smith S.A. Pogson C.I. Biochem. J. 1977; 168: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Furman B.L. Wilson G.A. Diabetologia. 1980; 19: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Yamada J.

Diabetologia. 1971; 7: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The precise nature by which 5-HT promotes hypoglycemia remains poorly understood, but it is unlikely to be related to changes in plasma insulin, since circulating levels of the hormone do not increase significantly following intraperitoneal administration of tryptophan, a 5-HT precursor (3Smith S.A. Pogson C.I. Biochem. J. 1977; 168: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Lundquist I. Ekholm R. Ericson L.E. Diabetologia. 1971; 7: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with the view that biogenic amines normally suppress, rather than enhance, pancreatic insulin release (14Lundquist I. Ekholm R. Ericson L.E. Diabetologia. 1971; 7: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Wilson J.P. Downs Jr., R.W. Feldman J.M. Lebovitz H.E. Am. J.

An alternative possibility is that 5-HT may stimulate glucose transport by acting directly upon tissues such as skeletal muscle which, by virtue of its total body mass, could make a significant contribution toward a reduction in circulating levels of blood glucose. This proposition is based on recent work showing that rat fetal myoblasts express the 5-HT2A receptor (18Guillet-Deniau I. Burnol A.F. Girard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14825-14829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and that activation of this receptor enhances the expression of genes associated with myogenic differentiation and that of the fetal glucose transporter, GLUT3 (18Guillet-Deniau I. Burnol A.F. Girard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14825-14829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Increased expression of muscle glucose transporters may play a role in the hypoglycemic action of 5-HT, but changes in transporter expression are generally slow in onset (18Guillet-Deniau I. Burnol A.F. Girard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14825-14829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and previous work has shown that 5-HT precursors (e.g. 5-hydoroxytryptophan) can reduce blood glucose in fed animals within 1 h of administration (3Smith S.A. Pogson C.I. Biochem. J. 1977; 168: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In an attempt to assess whether 5-HT can stimulate skeletal muscle glucose transport, we have specifically addressed the following questions. (i) Do L6 muscle cells and skeletal muscle from rats and humans express the 5-HT2A receptor? (ii) Do 5-HT and specific 5-HT2A receptor agonists acutely regulate skeletal muscle glucose transport, and if so (iii) can the effects be explained on the basis of changes in the subcellular distribution of glucose transporters? (iv) Does the response involve cellular components (such as IRS1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and protein kinase B), which have been implicated in the insulin-induced activation of glucose transport in skeletal muscle? L6 rat skeletal muscle cells were provided by Dr. Amira Klip (Toronto). d-Glucose and all other reagent grade chemicals for buffers were obtained from BDH (Poole, Dorset, UK). Sterile trypsin solution, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG), cytochalasin B, and human insulin were obtained from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK). 2-[1,2-3H]deoxy-d-glucose was purchased from New England Nuclear (Dreiech, Germany). Monolayers of L6 muscle cells were grown to the stage of myotubes as described previously (19Mitsumoto Y. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4957-4962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in α-minimum essential medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and 1% antimicotic/antibiotic solution (final concentration 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml amphotericin B) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Muscle cells were grown in six-well multidishes for transport measurements and in 15-cm culture dishes for subcellular fractionation studies. Human soleus muscle was obtained from patients at Dundee Royal Infirmary while undergoing elective limb amputation surgery for peripheral vascular complications. Upon surgical excision, ∼5 g of soleus muscle was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until required for study. For isolation of crude rat muscle membranes we used male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g, Bantin & Kingman, Hull, UK) that were killed by cervical dislocation. Hindlimb skeletal muscle was excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until required. Rat and human skeletal muscles were homogenized and subjected to differential centrifugation for isolation of crude muscle membranes as described previously (20Aledo J.C. Lavoie L. Volchuk A. Keller S.R. Klip A. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Hundal H.S. Maxwell D.L. Ahmed A. Darakhshan F. Mitsumoto Y. Klip A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1994; 11: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For glucose uptake studies in skeletal muscle, smaller rats were used as described below. L6 myotubes were exposed to insulin, 5-HT, or to a specific 5-HT2A receptor agonist (α-methylhydroxytryptamine (m-HT), Tocris, Bristol, UK), antagonist (ketanserin tartarate, Tocris, Bristol, UK) or wortmannin at concentrations and for periods indicated in the figure legends. Following the appropriate treatments 2DG uptake was assayed as described previously (22McDowell H.E. Walker T. Hajduch E. Christie G. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Hundal H.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). For glucose uptake in isolated rat muscle, male Sprague-Dawley rats (50 g, Bantin & Kingman) were killed by cervical dislocation and soleus muscle from both hindlimbs removed. Each isolated soleus muscle was cut into two strips, subsequently weighed (∼15 mg), and pinned at the tendon ends onto an inert resin base in a well of six-well multiculture dish. Each well contained 3 ml of Krebs Henseleit buffer (KCl, 4.7 mm; CaCl2, 2.5 mm; K2PO4, 1.2 mm, MgSO4, 1.2 mm; NaHCO3, 25 mm: glucose, 25 mm; bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v), pH 7.4) pregassed with O2/CO2 (95%/5%) at 37 °C. Muscle strips were allowed to recover for 15 min at 37 °C with continuous oxygenation and gentle rotation on a platform shaker and then incubated for a further 30 min in the absence or presence of 1 milliunit/ml insulin (Novo, Denmark) or 50 μm m-HT. At the end of this period, muscle strips were rapidly washed three times with glucose-free KH buffer (at 37 °C) and then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in uptake buffer (KH buffer containing 10 μm2-[1,2-3H]deoxy-d-glucose (1 μCi/ml) and [14C]mannitol (0.2 μCi/ml, used as an extracellular reference marker). Following this incubation period muscles were washed three times with ice-cold saline and then maintained in cold saline for 40 min before blotting on filter paper and solubilization in 1 ml of 0.5 n NaOH at 60 °C for 45 min. Solubilized muscle extracts were then processed for liquid scintillation counting. Total L6 cell membranes, plasma, and intracellular membranes were prepared from muscle cells as described previously (24Bilan P.J. Mitsumoto Y. Ramlal T. Klip A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The protein content of each of the isolated membrane fractions was determined using the Bradford assay with BSA as standard (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar). Isolated membrane fractions from L6 cells and rat and human skeletal muscle were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% resolving gels and immunoblotted as previously reported (24Bilan P.J. Mitsumoto Y. Ramlal T. Klip A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). IRS1 immunoprecipitates were run on a 7% resolving gel. Nitrocellulose membranes were probed with antisera against the α1 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase (Mck1, 1:100 generously provided by Dr. K. Sweadner, Harvard University (26Felsenfeld D.P. Sweadner K.J.

Primary antibody detection was performed using either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000, SAPU, Scotland) or anti-mouse (1:2000, Scottish Antibody Production Unit) for 1 h and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Life Sciences, Bucks, UK). Immunoreactive signals on autoradiographs were quantitated using a Bio-Rad 670 densitometer. L6 cells were extracted on 10-cm plates in the lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mmNa4P2O7, 1 μmmicrocystin-LR, 0.27 m sucrose, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. 500 μg of cell lysate protein was centrifuged at 13,000 × g and IRS1 immunoprecipitated from lysates using a C-terminal IRS1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Immunocomplexes were captured by incubation with protein A-agarose beads and solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. PIP3 was measured using a sensitive ligand binding displacement assay as reported previously (27van der Kaay J. Batty I.H. Cross D.A.E. Watt P.W. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5477-5481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For analysis of PKBα activity, L6 cells were extracted on 10-cm plates in lysis buffer (composition as described above). PKBα was immunoprecipitated from lysates using a C-terminal PKBα antibody (28Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar) and kinase activity assayed using a synthetic peptide substrate “crosstide” (GRPRTSSFAEG) corresponding to the sequence in GSK3 surrounding the Ser residue phosphorylated by MAPKAPK1 and p70S6 kinase as described previously (23Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 28Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). One unit of activity was defined as that amount which catalyzed the phosphorylation of 1 nmol of substrate in 1 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was carried out using a two-tailed Student's t test. Data were considered statistically significant at p values ≤ 0.05. Previous work has shown that administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan and pargyline (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor that prevents breakdown of 5-HT) to rodents induces a profound lowering in blood glucose (3Smith S.A. Pogson C.I. Biochem. J. 1977; 168: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Lundquist I. Ekholm R. Ericson L.E. Diabetologia. 1971; 7: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In these studies the resulting hypoglycemia could not be explained by an increase in insulin secretion, and the effect could be abolished when animals were pretreated with an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid decarboxylation, which prevents the conversion of 5-hydroxytryptophan to 5-HT (14Lundquist I. Ekholm R. Ericson L.E. Diabetologia. 1971; 7: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These observations collectively suggested that 5-HT was the active hypoglycemic agent. We entertained the possibility that one potential mechanism by which 5-HT may promote a lowering in blood glucose was by directly stimulating glucose uptake in skeletal muscle; a notion based on recent work showing that rat fetal myoblasts express the 5-HT2A receptor (18Guillet-Deniau I. Burnol A.F. Girard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14825-14829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis we initially carried out SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting to determine whether the 5-HT2A receptor was expressed in total membranes prepared from L6 muscle cells and crude membranes from mature rat and human skeletal muscle. Rat brain and human liver microsomes were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Using a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the 5-HT2A receptor subtype, a single immunoreactive band of ∼55 kDa was observed in all three muscle samples, which migrated alongside that seen in the rat brain sample (Fig. 1A). Quantitative analyses of immunoblot data from three separate experiments revealed that 5-HT2A receptor expression was higher by 3.2 ± 0.6-fold in fully differentiated L6 myotubes (day 8) compared with that in L6 myoblasts (day 3). The apparent difference in 5-HT2A receptor expression between myoblasts and myotubes could not be attributed to the aberrant loading of membrane protein on SDS gels, as no differences were observed in the abundance of the α1-Na,K-ATPase subunit in the same L6 membranes (Fig. 1B). Having established that L6 cells and rat skeletal muscle express the 5-HT2A receptor, we investigated whether 5-HT acutely regulated 2DG uptake in L6 myotubes and isolated rat soleus muscle. When muscle cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of 5-HT (between 1 nm and 100 μm), there was a dose-dependent increase in 2DG uptake (Fig. 2). Measurements of circulating 5-HT levels indicate that whole blood 5-HT is approximately 1 μg/ml (equating to ∼5 μm), whereas the platelet-free plasma circulating concentration is ∼10 nm (29Martin F.J. Miguez J.M. Aldegunde M. Atienza G. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the observation that skeletal muscle expresses a 5-HT2Areceptor and that glucose uptake can be stimulated within the physiological range of blood 5-HT implies that signaling via this receptor may represent a novel mechanism regulating muscle glucose uptake in vivo. In order to gain further insights into the mechanism by which 5-HT stimulates glucose uptake, all subsequent experiments were performed using maximally effective concentrations (50 μm) of either 5-HT or the 5-HT2A agonist methylserotonin (m-HT). Both agents increased 2DG uptake by ∼50% (Fig. 3A), and identical results were obtained when using 50 μm quipazine (another 5-HT2 agonist, data not shown). The 5-HT- and m-HT-induced increase in 2DG uptake was lower than that seen in response to insulin (Fig. 3A), but neither 5-HT nor m-HT could elicit a significant additive stimulation when simultaneously presented to muscle cells with insulin (Fig. 3A). Very similar observations were made in isolated rat soleus strips in which insulin and m-HT caused a 2.7-fold and 50% increase in 2DG uptake, respectively (Fig. 3B). As with L6 cells, we found that exposing soleus strips simultaneously to insulin and m-HT did not result in any additive stimulation in glucose uptake (Fig. 3B). The finding that m-HT increases glucose uptake in both cultured muscle cells and isolated rat muscle in a manner similar to that seen in response to 5-HT is therefore consistent with the suggestion that the effects of the latter are also mediated via the 5-HT2A receptor. This view is further strengthened by the observation that the stimulatory effects of m-HT (and 5-HT, data not shown) were suppressed in the presence of submicromolar concentrations of the 5-HT2A antagonist, ketanserin (Fig. 3C). The observed antagonism takes place within the expectedK d range reported for the antagonist in the literature (i.e. <10 nm (6Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-203PubMed Google Scholar)) and is, moreover, in line with findings from other groups reporting that low nanomolar concentrations of ketanserin block 5-HT action via the 5-HT2 receptor subtype (30Monopoli A.

A, L6 myotubes were incubated with insulin (100 nm) for 30 min, with 5-HT (50 μm) or m-HT (50 μm) for 10 min, or with insulin and m-HT (Ins, 30 min/m-HT, added during the last 10 min of insulin incubation). 2-[1,2-3H]deoxy-d-Glucose was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent means ± S.E. from at least three separate experiments.B, rat soleus strips were incubated for 30 min with m-HT (50 μm), insulin (1 milliunit/ml), or with insulin and m-HT (Ins/m-HT).

Fig. 4 shows representative immunublots from three separate experiments showing that m-HT induces an increase in the plasma membrane abundance of all three transporters by between 40 and 60%. The increase in surface GLUT content takes place as a result of their recruitment from the intracellular compartment, which showed a corresponding loss in each of the three GLUT proteins. The increase in plasma membrane GLUT content following exposure of L6 cells to m-HT was very rapid and highly reminiscent of that seen in response to treatment of muscle cells with insulin (23Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 31Tsakiridis T. McDowell H.E. Walker T. Downes C.P. Hundal H.S. Vranic M. Klip A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the observed translocation of all three transporters seen in response to m-HT was less than that evoked by insulin (Fig. 4). Given that m-HT and insulin do not cause any additive increase in glucose uptake, it is conceivable that both stimuli signal via their respective membrane receptors onto the same intracellular pool of glucose transporters by either distinct or convergent signaling pathways. To gain some insight into whether components of the insulin-signaling pathway may participate in 5-HT2A receptor signaling we first investigated the effects of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, wortmannin, on the agonist induced stimulation in glucose uptake. In line with previous work from our group, Fig. 5A shows that wortmannin induced a 50% reduction in basal glucose uptake and completely blocked insulin-stimulated glucose transport in L6 myotubes (22McDowell H.E. Walker T. Hajduch E. Christie G. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Hundal H.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, exposure of muscle cells to 50 μm m-HT following pretreatment with 100 nm wortmannin resulted in a modest, but significant, increase in 2DG uptake by ∼25% (similar results were also obtained when using the structurally unrelated PI3K inhibitor LY294002, data not shown). Since wortmannin is known to suppress the externalization of glucose transporters that recycle between the cell surface and endosomal compartment (32Yang J. Clarke J.F. Ester C.J. Young P.W. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 33Clarke J.F. Young P.W. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), we believe that this is likely to contribute to the reduced activation in glucose uptake by m-HT. The finding that m-HT is still capable of causing a significant stimulation in glucose uptake in the presence of wortmannin, whereas insulin fails to elicit any increase, is consistent with the idea that PI3K participates in insulin signaling but not in 5-HT2Amediated signaling. In an attempt to resolve this issue further, we investigated whether 5-HT2A receptor stimulation modulated the phosphorylation status of IRS1 and the activities of PI3K and protein kinase Bα. Fig. 5B shows an anti-phosphotyrosine blot of IRS1 immunoprecipitates prepared from control and insulin- and m-HT-treated muscle cells. Insulin, but not m-HT, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1, suggesting that the latter was not a downstream target for the 5-HT2A receptor. Moreover, analyses of IRS1 precipitates with an antibody against the regulatory 85-kDa PI3K subunit revealed that p85 was only associated with IRS1 in insulin-treated cells. However, since 5-HT2A belongs to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors and heterotrimeric G-protein-regulated forms of PI3K have been identified (34Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), it is plausible that 5-HT may stimulate PI3K independently of IRS1. It is also noteworthy that G-protein-coupled receptors have been shown to activate PKB in human phagocytes and COS-7 cells ectopically expressing muscarinic acetylcholine receptors that couple to Gq and Gi (35Tilton B.

Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19080-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Since PKB lies downstream of PI3K, and we and others have implicated it in the insulin-mediated translocation of GLUT4 (23Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 37Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), activation of PI3K by a G-protein-coupled receptor may represent one potential mechanism of stimulating PKB and hence glucose uptake in muscle. However, the data shown in TableI and Fig. 5C does not support such a mechanism. L6 myotubes exposed to 50 μm 5-HT or m-HT did not display any detectable increase in cellular PIP3 or PKBα phosphorylation and activity. In contrast, insulin provoked a 2.2-fold increase in PIP3 production and a 41-fold stimulation in PKBα activity and phosphorylation of its Ser473 residue (Table Iand Fig. 5C). The insulin-induced increase in PIP3 and PKBα activity was abolished when muscle cells were pretreated with wortmannin prior to stimulation with insulin (Table I). Thus while we cannot exclude the possibility that 5-HT2A receptor signaling may converge at some point downstream of PKB with the insulin signaling pathway, our data rules out any involvement of PI3K or PKB in the 5-HT2A-mediated increase in muscle glucose uptake. An alternative signaling mechanism may involve the phospholipase C/protein kinase C pathway, which the 5-HT2A receptor is thought to activate via a G-protein-mediated interaction (8Conn P.J.

Gupta K. Hardy R.W. Wells A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5170-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but it currently remains unknown whether phospholipase C is activated by 5-HT2A receptor agonists in L6 cells and, if so, whether this plays any part in modulating the number of cell surface glucose transporters in skeletal muscle. Addressing this issue remains an interesting topic for future study.Table IEffects of insulin, serotonin (5-HT), and methylserotonin (m-HT) on cellular PIP3 levels and protein kinase B activity in L6 muscle cellsConditionPIP3PKB activitypmol/mg proteinmilliunits/mg proteinBasal2.4 ± 0.040.33 ± 0.05Insulin5.4 ± 0.4aStatistically significant change (p < 0.05) compared with the respective basal value.13.7 ± 0.47aStatistically significant change (p < 0.05) compared with the respective basal value.5-HT2.3 ± 0.80.26 ± 0.06m-HT2.6 ± 0.50.39 ± 0.14Wortmannin/insulin2.5 ± 0.040.23 ± 0.17L6 myotubes were incubated for 10 min with insulin (100 nm), 5-HT (50 μm), m-HT (50 μm), or wortmannin/insulin (wortmannin, 100 nm, 15 min; insulin 100 nm, 10 min) and prepared for analyses of PIP3 and PKBα activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are from at least three experiments for PKB (mean ± S.E.) and from two separate experiments each conducted in triplicate for PIP3 (mean ± S.D.).a Statistically significant change (p < 0.05) compared with the respective basal value.

In summary, our results show that the 5-HT2A receptor is expressed in rat and human skeletal muscle. Stimulation of this receptor with 5-HT or a specific 5-HT2A agonist causes a rapid stimulation in glucose transport that occurs as a result of the increased recruitment of glucose transporters from an intracellular pool to the cell surface. The post-receptor signaling events involved in eliciting this stimulation currently remain unknown, but they do not involve signaling molecules that participate in early events of insulin signaling (i.e. IRS1, PI3K, or PKBα). The finding that the 5-HT2A receptor can modulate glucose transport is likely to be physiologically significant given that plasma 5-HT levels are known to increase during muscle exercise (40Newsholme E.A. Blomstrand E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 384: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and fall during diabetes (29Martin F.J. Miguez J.M. Aldegunde M. Atienza G. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); conditions during which utilization of glucose is significantly modulated in skeletal muscle. Understanding how the 5-HT2Areceptor signals an increase in muscle glucose uptake may prove potentially valuable in developing new strategies aimed at improving glucose utilization in skeletal muscle during circumstances when this tissue may be profoundly resistant to insulin action. We are grateful to Froogh Darakhshan and Anne Blair who participated in some of the studies reported and to Dario Alessi and Armelle Leturque for useful discussions. We also thank A. Jain and the staff of Orthopedic theater at Dundee Royal Infirmary for providing us with access to human muscle tissue."

Considerable evidence suggests that there is an interaction between G proteins and the cytoskeleton. In this report, G protein α subunits Gi1α, Gsα, and Goα are shown to activate the GTPase activity of tubulin, inhibit microtubule assembly, and accelerate microtubule dynamics. Giα inhibited polymerization of tubulin-GTP into microtubules by 80–90% in the absence of exogenous GTP. Addition of exogenous GTP, but not guanylylimidodiphosphate, which is resistant to hydrolysis, overcame the inhibition. Analysis of the dynamics of individual microtubules by video microscopy demonstrated that Gi1α increases the catastrophe frequency, the frequency of transition from growth to shortening.

Thus, Gα may play a role in modulating microtubule dynamic instability, providing a mechanism for the modification of the cytoskeleton by extracellular signals. Microtubules, a major component of the cytoskeleton, are involved in a variety of cellular functions including chromosome movements during mitosis, intracellular transport, and the modulation of cell morphology. In general, the biological function of microtubules is based in significant part on the ability of tubulin to polymerize and depolymerize. In living cells, microtubules exist in both dynamic and stable populations, with each population called upon to carry out distinct cellular functions (1Bulinski J.C. Gundersen G.G. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 2McNally F.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Proper control of microtubule dynamics is essential for many microtubule-dependent processes. Microtubule ends can interconvert between slow elongation and rapid shortening, a process called dynamic instability, because of the presumed gain and loss of a small region of tubulin-liganded GTP at the microtubule end (3Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2330) Google Scholar, 4Sammak P.J. Borisy G.G. Nature. 1988; 332: 724-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 5Cassimeris L.

Tubulin dimers bind 2 mol of GTP/mol of tubulin, one exchangeable (the E-site 1The abbreviation used is: E-site, exchangeable site; GppNHp, guanylylimidodiphosphate; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviation used is: E-site, exchangeable site; GppNHp, guanylylimidodiphosphate; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. in β-tubulin) and the other nonexchangeable (in α-tubulin). GTP bound to the exchangeable site becomes hydrolyzed upon incorporation of the tubulin into the microtubule. This hydrolysis creates a microtubule consisting largely of GDP-tubulin, but a small region of GTP-liganded tubulin, called a “GTP cap,” remains at the end. The loss of the cap results in a transition from growth to shortening (called a catastrophe), whereas the reacquisition of the GTP cap results in a transition from shortening to growing (called a rescue) (6Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The GTPase activity of tubulin is normally low, and hydrolysis of the E-site GTP requires activation. This activation normally occurs when the tubulin dimer binds to the end of a growing microtubule. It is thus suggested that one tubulin dimer might act as a GTPase activator for another during polymerization (7Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). Several microtubule-associated proteins are known to regulate microtubule dynamics by stabilizing microtubules (8Murphy D.B.

Stabilization of microtubules by microtubule-associated proteins is achieved, in part, by suppressing the rate and extent of microtubule shortening and by suppressing the catastrophe frequency and increasing the rescue frequency (6Walker R.A.

This binding appears to activate the G proteins in association with a direct transfer of GTP from the E-site in tubulin to Gα (transactivation) (29Roychowdhury S. Wang N. Rasenick M.M.

In addition to activating Gα, the association between Gα and tubulin induces a GTPase activity in tubulin similar to that seen after the self-association of tubulin dimers during the formation of a microtubule (32Roychowdhury S. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9800-9805Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also shown that Gβ1γ2 binds to microtubules and promotes microtubule assembly in vitro (26Roychowdhury S. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31576-31581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that G proteins may modulate microtubule polymerization dynamics and cytoskeletal organization or function. In the present study, the modulation of microtubule assembly and dynamics by G protein α subunits was investigated. We report here that α subunits of G proteins activate the intrinsic GTPase of tubulin (i.e. they act as a GTPase activating protein for tubulin), and the GTP hydrolysis modulates microtubule assembly and dynamics in vitro. Tubulin for all studies except the dynamic instability analysis was purified from fresh sheep brain by cycles of assembly and disassembly (33Shelanski M. Gaskin F. Cantor C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar) followed by phosphocellulose chromatography (34Weingarten M.D. Lockwood A.H. Hwo S.-Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The resulting tubulin preparations were more than 97% pure as determined by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (not shown). The tubulin was stored in liquid nitrogen and used within 2 weeks. Bovine brain tubulin was used for dynamic instability analyses as described elsewhere (10Panda D. Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11117-11127Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Tubulin liganded with GTP, GppNHp, or [α-32P]GTP was prepared by removing exchangeable nucleotide from the tubulin by charcoal treatment followed by incubation with 0.5 mm GTP, 0.5 mm GppNHp, or 0.1 mm[α-32P]GTP (31Rasenick M.M. Wang N. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 300-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The samples were then desalted twice on centrifugal gel filtration columns using P6-DG resin (Bio-Rad) as described previously (31Rasenick M.M. Wang N. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 300-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After desalting, 0.5–0.8 mol of guanine nucleotide was bound/mol of tubulin. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (35Bradford M.M. Anal.

Recombinant Gi1α, Gsα, or Goα were produced inEscherichia coli using constructs provided by Dr. Maurine Linder (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). The vector used contained Gi1α, Gsα, or Goα cDNA preceded by a nucleotide sequence encoding a His6-amino acid stretch as an affinity tag under the control of a T7 promoter. E. coli was grown and harvested, and G proteins were purified over a Qiagen nickel column with a subsequent MonoQ high pressure liquid chromatography step (36Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G.

The samples were then incubated with or without Gα at 30 °C for 30 min and treated with 1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min. Nucleotide analysis was done by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (32Roychowdhury S. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9800-9805Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,38Roychowdhury S. Gaskin F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7847-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Two μl of a 10 mm solution of GTP and GDP were spotted 1.5 cm apart on a polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer plate, followed by 2–5 μl of each sample. The chromatograms were developed in 0.35 m NH4HCO3. The spots containing GTP or GDP were visualized with a UV lamp, and plates were exposed to film for autoradiography. Quantitative analysis was done using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system. Tubulin-GTP or tubulin-GppNHp in PEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.9) was preincubated with or without Gα at 30 °C for 30 min. Polymerization was then initiated by adding 30% glycerol and an additional 2 mmMgCl2 and incubating at 37 °C for 45 min to 1 h. The extent of microtubule assembly was quantified after pelleting the microtubule polymers by centrifugation at 150,000 × gfor 20 min at 37 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 4 °C PEM buffer, and protein concentrations in the pellet and supernatant fractions were determined (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). Before testing the effect of G proteins on microtubule assembly, free nucleotide was separated from G protein α subunits, and the buffer was changed to PEM by passage of the proteins through a rapid spin column (Bio-Gel P6DG, Bio-Rad). Alternatively, when Gα concentrations were low, a buffer control was performed to avoid a reduction in protein concentration by gel filtration. Fifteen μl of the microtubule sample was placed on a Formvar-coated nickel grid. After 10–15 s, the grids were rinsed with 10 drops of 2% uranyl acetate for negative staining, blotted dry with a filter paper, and viewed in a JEOL 100S electron microscope. Tubulin (12 μm) was mixed with Strongylocentrotus purpuratus flagellar seeds in 80 mm PIPES, 0.8 mm Mg2+, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8 (PME buffer), containing 275 μm GTP in the absence or presence of Gi1α and incubated for 25 min at 37 °C for assembly to reach steady state. The seed concentration was adjusted to achieve 3–6 seeds/microscope field. 2.5 μl of the microtubule suspension was prepared for video microscopy, and the dynamics of individual microtubules were recorded at 37 °C as described previously (10Panda D. Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11117-11127Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Under the experimental conditions used, microtubule growth occurred predominantly at the plus ends of the seeds as determined by the growth rates, the number of microtubules that grew, and the relative lengths of the microtubules at the opposite ends of the seeds (6Walker R.A.

Microtubule length changes were measured in real time at 3–6 s intervals until microtubules underwent complete depolymerization to the axoneme seed or until the microtubule end became obscured. The length changes undergone by a particular microtubule as a function of time were used to create a “life history” plot. The growing and shortening rates were determined by least squares regression analysis of the data points for each growing or shortening phase. The reported mean growing and shortening rates represent the mean values for all growing and shortening events observed for a particular reaction condition. We considered a microtubule to be in a growing phase if the microtubule increased in length by >0.2 μm at a rate >0.15 μm/min and in a shortening phase if the microtubule shortened in length by >0.2 μm at a rate >0.3 μm/min. Length changes equal to or less than 0.2 μm over the duration of 6 data points were considered as attenuation phases. A total of 22–25 microtubules was analyzed for each experimental condition. The catastrophe frequency was determined by dividing the number of catastrophes by the sum of the total time spent in the growing plus attenuated states for all microtubules for a particular condition. The rescue frequency was calculated by dividing the total number of rescue events by the total time spent in the shortening states for all microtubules for a particular condition. Tubulin binds to Gi1α and Gsα with a K d of approximately 130 nmcoupled with a transactivation of Gα in which 25–50% of E-site tubulin-bound GTP is transferred directly to the Gα (28Wang N. Yan K. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1239-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Roychowdhury S. Wang N. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4955-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Gi1α binding to tubulin in vitro also activates GTP hydrolysis (32Roychowdhury S. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9800-9805Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both tubulin and Gi1α have intrinsic GTPase activities. Because the intrinsic GTPase activity of tubulin is very low, two possibilities exist to explain the higher rate of GTP hydrolysis. One possibility is that Giα hydrolyzes the E-site-bound GTP after transfer to the Giα. The second possibility is that Giα activates the GTPase of tubulin by inducing a conformational change in the tubulin, similar to the way in which tubulin dimers activate neighboring GTPase activity during microtubule polymerization. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used a mutated form of Gi1α with a single amino acid substitution, Gln204 → Lys (Q204LGi1α), with incapacitated GTPase activity. However, the ability of the mutated Q204LGi1α to bind GTP is unaltered (42Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The mutated Q204LGi1α, or wild-type Gi1α, was incubated with tubulin-[α-32P]GTP under conditions in which tubulin does not polymerize, and the extent of GTP hydrolysis was determined by thin layer chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1, the tubulin-bound [α-32P]GTP was poorly hydrolyzed in the absence of Gi1α (10.1 ± 1.9%, n = 10). In the presence of Gi1α, 71.8 ± 3.4% (n = 10) of the E-site-bound GTP was hydrolyzed. This hydrolysis could be a combination of that occurring in the tubulin E-site and in Gi1α. When Q204LGi1α was added to the tubulin, 49 ± 3% (n = 3) of the bound GTP was hydrolyzed. Because Q204LGi1α cannot hydrolyze GTP, the tubulin must have been responsible for the GTP hydrolysis. Because in the presence of Gi1α, 71.8% of the E-site GTP was hydrolyzed, approximately 23% of the GTP must have been hydrolyzed by Gi1α. Myristoylated Gi1α was also tested for its ability to activate tubulin GTPase. The amino terminus of Gi1α is myristoylated in vivo, a modification that is important for association of Gi1α with membranes and Gβγ (43Mumby S.M. Heuckeroth R.O. Gordon J.I. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We found that 80.4 ± 2.3% (n = 7) of the tubulin-bound [α-32P]GTP was hydrolyzed by myristoylated Gi1α. The slightly increased potency of myristoylated Gi1α to activate tubulin GTPase as compared with Gi1α may suggest an enhanced ability of myristoylated Gi1α to bind to tubulin. The results indicate that Gi1α may act as a GTPase activating protein for tubulin. Gi has been shown previously to inhibit microtubule polymerization (44Wang N. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10957-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This inhibition might occur by binding of the Gi to tubulin and sequestering it, making the tubulin unavailable for polymerization. Tubulin with GTP in the E-site (1.5 mg/ml) polymerizes into microtubules in the absence of exogenous GTP as shown in TableI. Assembly of the tubulin-GTP in the presence of 0.75 mg/ml of Gi1α resulted in ∼85% inhibition of assembly, and exogenous GTP overcame the ability of Gi1α to inhibit assembly in a GTP concentration-dependent manner. To determine whether inhibition of microtubule assembly by Gi1α was the result of hydrolysis of the E-site GTP by Gi1α, we prepared tubulin with GppNHp (a hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog) in the E-site. As also shown in Table I, in the absence of exogenous nucleotide, Gi1α reduced the extent of microtubule polymerization by approximately 85%, and exogenous GppNHp did not restore microtubule polymerization. Thus, it appears that GTP hydrolysis resulting from the association of tubulin and Gi1α plays a critical role in modulating microtubule assembly. When the microtubule pellet was analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis, Coomassie Blue staining did not reveal incorporation of Gi1α in microtubules. However, some incorporation of Gα into the microtubule fraction was observed by Western blotting using a Gi1α antibody (data not shown).Table IComparison of the effect of Gi1α on microtubule assembly induced by GTP or GppNHpGTPGppNHpSamplesMicrotubule assemblySamplesMicrotubule assembly% control% controlTubulin-GTP (control)100Tubulin-GppNHp (control)100+Gi1α14.6 ± 3.8+Gi1α15.3 ± 1.7+Gi1α → +5 μm GTP70.2 ± 5.7+Gi1α → +5 μm GppNHp26.4 ± 1.2Gi1α → +10 μm GTP93.5 ± 1.5Gi1α → +10 μmGppNHp19 ± 1.0Gi1α → +50 μmGTP113 ± 5.0Gi1α → +50 μmGppNHp22 ± 8.0Tubulin-GTP or tubulin-GppNHp was preincubated with or without Gi1α (as described in the Fig. 2 legend) followed by polymerization in the presence of GTP or GppNHp as indicated.

Addition of exogenous GTP to the tubulin-Gi1α complex with either GTP or GppNHp in the E-site reversed the ability of Gi1α to inhibit polymerization (Table II). Furthermore, addition of exogenous GppNHp to the tubulin-Gi1α complex with GTP in the E-site, inhibited microtubule polymerization. These results indicate that exogenous GTP and GppNHp can exchange with either GppNHp or GTP in the tubulin E-site when complexed with Gi1α. The GTPase-deficient Gi1α variant, Q204LGi1α, also inhibited microtubule polymerization in a manner similar to Gi1α (by 74.5 ± 9.5%), suggesting that GTP hydrolysis in Gα does not cause the inhibition of microtubule assembly.Table IIEffect of GTP or GppNHp on Gi1α-mediated inhibition of microtubule assemblyTubulin-GppNHpTubulin-GTPSamplesMicrotubule assemblySamplesMicrotubule assembly% control% controlTubulin-GppNHp (control)100Tubulin-GTP100+Gi1α19.2 ± 6.8+Gi1α11.1 ± 0.85+Gi1α → +10 μm GTP73.3 ± 9.2+Gi1α → +10 μm GppNHp17.2 ± 8.8Gi1α → +50 μm GTP101.6 ± 11.3Gi1α → +50 μmGppNHp17.5 ± 2.5Gi1α → +100 μmGTP118.5 ± 6.5Gi1α → +100 μmGppNHp21 ± 9Experimental protocol was similar to that as described in Table Iexcept that GTP (at indicated concentrations) was added to the samples in which tubulin-GppNHp was preincubated with Gi1α, whereas GppNHp was added to Gi1α-preincubated tubulin-GTP samples.

Open table in a new tab Experimental protocol was similar to that as described in Table Iexcept that GTP (at indicated concentrations) was added to the samples in which tubulin-GppNHp was preincubated with Gi1α, whereas GppNHp was added to Gi1α-preincubated tubulin-GTP samples. Samples were subjected to polymerization at 37 °C and quantified as in Table I. Values represent mean ± S.E. of two experiments. Electron microscopic analysis of the polymers formed in the presence of Gi1α and excess GTP or GppNHp indicated that they were normal microtubules. Gi1α blocked the formation of microtubules regardless of the nucleotide bound to the tubulin (Fig. 2,B and E). The addition of 50 μm GTP reversed the Gi1α-mediated inhibition of microtubule assembly, and microtubules were formed (Fig. 2C), whereas the addition of 50 μm GppNHp did not (Fig. 2F). Gsα binds to tubulin with an affinity similar to that of Gi1α (28Wang N. Yan K. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1239-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it was predicted that Gsα would also inhibit microtubule assembly. In the presence of Gsα, microtubule assembly was reduced to 22% (21.8 ± 10.5%) of the control (Fig. 3A). Although Goα does not bind to tubulin with an affinity as high as that of Gi1α or Gsα (28Wang N. Yan K. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1239-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Goα inhibited microtubule polymerization similarly to Gi1α and Gsα (by 85%). These results are consistent with the possibility that there is a preferential interaction of Gowith oligomeric tubulin or microtubules as compared with dimeric tubulin (44Wang N. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10957-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The retinal G protein transducin (Gtα), which does not bind to tubulin or microtubules, did not inhibit microtubule assembly (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the GTPase activity of tubulin was activated by Gsα (73.8 ± 3.8%) and Goα (93 ± 2.7%) but not by Gtα (28.5 ± 2.5%) (Fig. 3B). The activation of tubulin GTPase by Gi1α was maximal at a Gα:tubulin ratio of 1:1. In an effort to determine how Gα modulates microtubule polymerization dynamics, we measured the dynamics of individual microtubules at steady state in vitro, in the presence or absence of Gi1α, by video microscopy. Microtubules can alternate between phases of growing and shortening and also spend a small fraction of time in an attenuated (paused) state, neither growing nor shortening detectably, a behavior called dynamic instability (10Panda D. Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11117-11127Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The transition frequencies among the growing, shortening, and attenuated states are thought to be important in the regulation of microtubule dynamics in cells (13Belmont L. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 14Belmont L.D. Hyman A. Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J.

Cell. 1993; 4: 1035-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Life history traces of several microtubules in the absence (panel A) or presence (panel B) of Gi1α are shown in Fig. 4. Addition of Gi1α (4 μm) visually increased the catastrophe frequency. The dynamic instability parameters were determined quantitatively from such life history plots. As shown in Table III, Gi1α did not alter the rates of microtubule growth or shortening. However, 4 μm Gi1α significantly reduced the average length that microtubules grew per individual growth event (1.5 ± 0.2–0.9 ± 0.2 μm). Gi1α also reduced the percentage of total time that microtubules spent in the growing phase and increased the percentage of total time they spent in the shortening phase.Table IIIEffects of Gi1α on the dynamics of individual microtubulesNoneGi1α 2.0 μmGi1α 4.0 μmRate (μm/min)Growing0.45 ± 0.040.47 ± 0.0450.48 ± 0.042Shortening11.0 ± 3.111.6 ± 2.59.5 ± 2.1Length (μm/event)Growing1.5 ± 0.201.0 ± 0.10.90 ± 0.10Shortening3.5 ± 0.93.3 ± 0.42.7 ± 0.08% of total time in phaseGrowing80.170.168.8Shortening5.88.211.5Attenuation14.121.719.7Transition frequency (min−1)Catastrophe0.13 ± 0.030.24 ± 0.040.34 ± 0.05Rescue2.0 ± 0.51.6 ± 0.41.8 ± 0.3Transition frequency (μm−1)Catastrophe0.41 ± 0.090.88 ± 0.161.10 ± 0.17Rescue0.27 ± 0.060.18 ± 0.040.26 ± 0.05Dynamicity (μm/min)0.991.281.43Dynamic instability parameters were determined from life history plots of individual microtubules.

All values are ±S.E. Open table in a new tab Dynamic instability parameters were determined from life history plots of individual microtubules. The reported mean growing and shortening rates represent the mean values for all growing and shortening events observed for 22–25 microtubules at each Gi1α concentration. Tubulin is 12 μm throughout. All values are ±S.E. Gi1α significantly increased the catastrophe frequency (by 2.6-fold in the presence of 4 μm Gi1α). The catastrophe frequency per micrometer of length grown was determined by dividing the total number of catastrophic events by total length increase during growing events. Gi1α also increased the catastrophe frequency per micrometer of length grown. Gi1α had no effects on the rescue frequency (transition from shortening to the growing or attenuated state) per unit of time or per unit of length shortened (Table III). Dynamicity is a parameter that reflects the overall dynamics of the microtubules (the total detectable tubulin dimer addition and loss at a microtubule end including the time spent in the attenuated state) (39Toso R. Jordan M.A. Farrell K. Matsumoto B. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Gi1α (4 μm) increased the dynamicity by 44%. Thus, Gi1α increases the dynamic behavior of the microtubules primarily by increasing the catastrophe frequency. In the present study, the α subunits of G proteins (Gi1, Gs, and Go) were shown to activate the GTPase activity of tubulin, indicating that Gα may serve as a GTPase activating protein for tubulin. In addition, Gα inhibited microtubule assembly and increased microtubule dynamic instabilityin vitro. The assembly of tubulin into microtubules was blocked by Gα (80–90%), regardless of whether GTP or GppNHp was bound in the tubulin E-site. In addition, the addition of exogenous GTP, but not the addition of the hydrolysis-resistant GppNHp, overcame the inhibition of microtubule polymerization by Gα. A model for how Gα might interact with tubulin and how exogenous GTP might overcome the interaction is presented in Fig. 5A. In this model, Gα is suggested to bind to tubulin and activate the intrinsic GTPase of tubulin in a manner similar to that in which GTP hydrolysis occurs in tubulin during formation of a microtubule. However, unlike the formation of microtubules from tubulin dimers, Gα dissociates from the tubulin-Gα complex subsequent to GTP hydrolysis. Gi1α altered microtubule dynamics by increasing the catastrophe frequency (the frequency of switching from growing to shortening; see Table III). Microtubules are composed of an unstable tubulin-GDP core and a stable tubulin-GTP or tubulin-GDP-Picap at the microtubule ends (46Carlier M.-F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1989; 115: 139-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 47Erickson H.P. O'Brien E.T. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Microtubules grow for as long as they maintain a GTP cap, but loss of the cap exposes the labile tubulin-GDP core, and the microtubules rapidly shorten. These data are consistent with the possibility that Gi1α activates tubulin GTPase at the microtubule ends, thus resulting in loss of the GTP cap (Fig. 5B). Alternatively, Gi1α might increase the catastrophe frequency by reducing the effective tubulin concentration, thereby binding to and sequestering soluble tubulin. However, this sequence appears unlikely because Gi1α did not reduce the individual microtubule growth rate (Table III). It is suggested that Gα is released from microtubules after binding and subsequent hydrolysis of the E-site GTP. The released Gα could be recycled for further interaction with newly growing microtubules, reducing the Gα concentration required to exert this effect. In fact, 4 μm Gi1α, a concentration 3-fold lower than the tubulin concentration (12 μm), increased the catastrophe frequency 2.6-fold (Table III). Although G proteins are usually confined to the plasma membrane, translocation of activated Gα from the membrane to the cytosol has been observed (48Rasenick M.M. Wheeler G.L. Bitensky M.W.

Furthermore, whereas G proteins are normally associated with second messenger-generating enzymes, or ion channels, results from several laboratories suggest that G proteins may be involved in cell growth and differentiation, perhaps through their association with cytoskeletal components (21Lewis J.M.

For example, an association of Gα and Gβγ with the microtubule cytoskeleton has been reported (21Lewis J.M. Woolkalis M.J. Gerton G.L. Smith R.M. Jarett L. Manning D.R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 1097-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Cote M. Payet M.D. Gallo-Payet N. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Ravindra R.

Furthermore, an association of Goα and -β (or -βγ) with spindle microtubules suggests that G protein subunits may play some role in regulating the assembly and disassembly of the mitotic spindle (23Wu H.-C. Lin C.-T. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 175-181PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cote M. Payet M.D. Gallo-Payet N. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The β-adrenergic receptor kinase (known as βARK or GRK2), which mediates agonist-dependent phosphorylation and desensitization of G protein coupled receptors, has been shown to associate with microtubules and to phosphorylate tubulin in an agonist-dependent manner (19Carman C.V.

Taken together, these data suggest a link between microtubules and G protein-mediated signaling that may regulate cell division and differentiation. G proteins, particularly Goα and Gβ, are abundant at the growth cone membrane of neurons (52Strittmatter S.M. Valenzuela D. Kennedy T.E. Neer E.J. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1990; 344: 836-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Growth cones at the growing tips of developing neurites are highly specialized organelles that respond to a variety of extracellular signals to achieve neuronal guidance and target recognition. Coordinated assembly of microtubules in concert with actin filaments and neurofilaments is required for growth cone motility and neurite outgrowth (53Cheng N. Sahyoun N. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it is possible that these proteins participate in localized regulation of the cytoskeleton. Thus, microtubule dynamics at growth cones could be mediated by Goα and Giα. Based on observations in this report as well as the emerging results from various laboratories, it is reasonable to postulate that extracellular signals orchestrate G proteins (both Gα and Gβγ) and mobilize them to bind to microtubules. Such a process is likely to provide a venue by which extracellular signals modify cell form and growth.

https://openalex.org/W1573902696,"It is of wide interest to understand how opposing extracellular signals (positive or negative) are translated into intracellular signaling events. Receptor-ligand interactions initiate the generation of bioactive lipids by human neutrophils (PMN), which serve as signals to orchestrate cellular responses important in host defense and inflammation. We recently identified a novel polyisoprenyl phosphate (PIPP) signaling pathway and found that one of its components, presqualene diphosphate (PSDP), is a potent negative intracellular signal in PMN that regulates superoxide anion generation by several stimuli, including phosphatidic acid. We determined intracellular PIPP signaling by autocoids with opposing actions on PMN: leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent chemoattractant, and lipoxin A4 (LXA4), a 'stop signal' for recruitment. LTB4 receptor activation initiated a rapid decrease in PSDP levels concurrent with activation of PLD and cellular responses. In sharp contrast, activation of the LXA4 receptor reversed LTB4-initiated PSDP remodeling, leading to an accumulation of PSDP and potent inhibition of both PLD and superoxide anion generation. Thus, an inverse relationship was established for PSDP levels and PLD activity with two PMN ligands that evoke opposing responses. In addition, PSDP directly inhibited both isolated human recombinant (Ki = 6 nM) and plant (Ki = 20 nM) PLD. Together, these findings link PIPP remodeling to intracellular regulation of PMN function and suggest a role for PIPPs as lipid repressors in signal transduction, a novel mechanism that may also explain aspirin's suppressive actions in vivo in cell signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1597634966,"Type I allergy, an immunodisorder that affects almost 20% of the population worldwide, is based on the immunoglobulin E (IgE) recognition of per se innocuous antigens (allergens). Pollen from wind-pollinated plants belong to the most potent allergen sources. We report the isolation of a cDNA coding for a 8.6 kDa two EF-hand calcium binding allergen, Phl p 7, from a timothy grass (Phleum pratense) pollen expression cDNA library, using serum IgE from a grass pollen allergic patient. Sequence analysis identified Phl p 7 as a member of a recently discovered subfamily of pollen-specific calcium binding proteins. Recombinant Phl p 7 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as determined by mass spectroscopy. Approximately 10% of pollen allergic patients displayed IgE reactivity to rPhl p 7 and Phl p 7-homologous allergens present in pollens of monocotyledonic and dicotyledonic plants. Circular dichroism analysis of the calcium-bound and apo-rPhl p 7 indicated that differences in IgE recognition may be due to calcium-induced changes in the protein conformation. The fact that patients mount IgE antibodies against different protein conformations is interpreted as a footprint of a preferential sensitization against either form. The biological activity of rPhl p 7 was demonstrated by its ability to induce basophil histamine release and immediate type skin reactions in sensitized individuals. In conclusion, IgE binding to Phl p 7 represents an example for the conformation-dependent IgE recognition of an allergen. Recombinant Phl p 7 may be used for diagnosis and perhaps treatment of a group of patients who suffer from allergy to pollens of many unrelated plant species."

https://openalex.org/W1980347800,"ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) are implicated in a diverse array of physiological functions. Previous work has shown that alternative usage of exons 14, 39, and 40 of the muscle-specific KATP channel regulatory subunit, sur2, occurs in tissue-specific patterns. Here, we show that exon 17 of the first nucleotide binding fold of sur2 is also alternatively spliced. RNase protection demonstrates that SUR2(Δ17) predominates in skeletal muscle and gut and is also expressed in bladder, fat, heart, lung, liver, and kidney. Polymerase chain reaction and restriction digest analysis of sur2 cDNA demonstrate the existence of at least five sur2 splice variants as follows: SUR2(39), SUR2(40), SUR2(Δ17/39), SUR2(Δ17/40), and SUR2(Δ14/39). Electrophysiological recordings of excised, inside-out patches from COS cells cotransfected with Kir6.2 and the sur2 variants demonstrated that exon 17 splicing alters KATP sensitivity to ATP block by 2-fold from ≈40 to ≈90 μm for exon 17 and Δ17, respectively. Single channel kinetic analysis of SUR2(39) and SUR2(Δ17/39) demonstrated that both exhibited characteristic KATP kinetics but that SUR2(Δ17/39) exhibited longer mean burst durations and shorter mean interburst dwell times.

Primers (forward, 5′-GAA GCTGGCGGAGGCTCAGAAGAG-3′; reverse, 5′- GATCGGGCCCACTTTTCGAG TGTGGACAGA TCGTA-3) were designed to reside 500 bp 5′ to exon 14 and 3′ of exon 40. These primers were used to amplify cDNA using Klentaq polymerase under the following conditions: 36 cycles of 96 °C × 30 s melting, 68 °C × 3 min annealing/extension. The products were purified by Qiaprep PCR purification (Qiagen) and digested with HaeII (New England Biolabs). The digested products were resolved on 0.8% SeaKem agarose gels (FMC), and the corresponding sur2 fragments with and without exon 14 were gel-purified using Qiaex II gel purification (Qiagen). The purified DNA fragments were digested with XbaI (New England Biolabs) and then resolved on 2.0% SeaKem agarose gels. Primers were generated to reside entirely within exon 17 and exon 39 or were designed to exclude the two exons leaving 3–4 bp overhanging the splice junction at the 3′ end of the primer (3′ overhangs are underlined).

PCR conditions and agarose gel electrophoresis are as stated above. A 375-bp cDNA probe corresponding to the sur2 coding region bp 1879–2254 was generated by PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and subcloned into Bluescript KS+ (Stratagene). Sequence integrity and orientation was confirmed by dye termination sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Perkin-Elmer). This template was used to generate labeled antisense RNA transcripts by in vitro transcription in the presence of 800 Ci/mmol α-[32P]CTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T3 RNA polymerase (Promega). A β-actin loading control probe was generated in a similar fashion using Tri-actin mouse 125 as a template (Ambion). A full-lengthsur2 cDNA with exon 39 CTD was subcloned into a pcDNA3 vector. The construct was digested with Xba and primed with an antisense oligonucleotide directed to exon 39, 5′-TGGAGCAGGTTTGGACCAGTATAC-3′. Run-off primer extension was performed in the presence of 3000 Ci/mmol α-[32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with Klenow polymerase (Ambion). The labeled probes were purified from the template by denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis, and the band containing the probe was excised and eluted from the gel overnight in TE at 37 °C. A β-actin loading control probe was generated in a similar fashion using Tri-actin mouse 125 as a template (Ambion). 40 μg of total RNA, isolated by TRIzol extraction, was coprecipitated with 5 × 105cpm labeled probe, resuspended in hybridization solution (Ambion), and allowed to hybridize for 18 h at 44 °C. The hybridized RNA were digested with RNase A and T1 for 30 min (RNase protection assay) or with S1 nuclease at 37 °C for 30 min, and the protected products were resolved on a standard denaturing sequencing gel. The gel was autoradiographically exposed to Biomax MR film (Kodak) overnight at −80 °C or was exposed to a phosphorimaging cassette (Molecular Dynamics) for 3 h at room temperature for quantitation. Full-length sur2 cDNA coding regions (bp 1–4644) were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector (pcDNA3, Invitrogen) using standard molecular biological techniques (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

COS-1 and COS-7 cells (ATCC), grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/high glucose + 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells onto scored glass coverslips in 60-mm plates, 12–18 h prior to transfection. Each plate was transfected with 5 μg of total plasmid DNA, with a molar ratio of 4:4:1 SUR2-pcDNA3:mβ-cell inward rectifier-pCMV6b:GFP-greenlantern (Life Technologies, Inc.), using the Superfect transfection system (Qiagen). The cells were used for recording 72 h post-transfection. Cells were selected for recording based on their green fluorescence at 525 nm when excited at 480 nm due to the coexpression of green fluorescent protein. Pipettes (1–3 megohms) were filled with “pipette solution” containing (mm) 140 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 0.22 MgCl2, 5 HEPES-KOH or HEPES-NaOH at pH 7.4. In some experiments, 130 NaCl + 10 KCl was iso-osmotically substituted for 140 NaCl as indicated in the text. Transfected cells were placed in a chamber bath perfused with “internal solution” containing (mm) 140 KCl, 0.2 MgCl2, 2 EGTA, 5 HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3; ATP, tolbutamide, and glyburide were added to the internal solutions as indicated in the text. The solutions superfusing the patch membrane were switched within 1 s using a fast solution switching system, DAD12 (ALA Instruments). Inside-out patches were recorded with an EPC-7 amplifier (List Electronics) for single channel and Axo200B (Axon Instruments) for multiple channel analysis. Single or multiple channel current recordings were filtered at 0.5–2 kHz, sampled at 5 kHz, and then stored digitally direct via the PCLAMP (Axon Instruments) and “Aquire” (Bruxton Corp.) software packages for subsequent offline data analysis. In patches containing a single active channel, channel open activity was assessed by an open probability (P o) as follows. A 50% threshold criterion was used to detect an event, and all events were visually confirmed. The dwell time at each level was determined using FETCHAN software (Axon Inst.). From this, theP o was calculated using the equation derived by Spruce et al. (34Spruce A.E. Standen N.B. Stanfield P.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 382: 213-236Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Patches containing multiple channels (≤5 channels) were calculated in a similar fashion. In macro-patch recordings (>5 channels), an apparent open probability (N P o) was employed. The N P o was calculated as the average current in a 10-s time window divided by the known single channel current amplitude under the same recording conditions. For single channel kinetic analysis, idealized current reconstructions for each recording were generated using “TAC/TACfit” program (Bruxton Corp.) based on a half-maximal amplitude threshold criterion. Open and closed time histogram analysis was performed on recordings demonstrating only a single level of channel activity. Burst durations were resolved at a critical time cutoff of 3.5 ms to distinguish a gap between two bursts from a closure within a burst (31Gillis K.D. Gee W.M. Hammoud A. McDaniel M.L. Falke L.C. Misler S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1119-C1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Alekseev A.E. Brady P.A. Terzic A. J. Gen.

Distributions of open and closed time events were plotted against a logarithmic time scale with event durations log-binned at 50-μs resolution. Exponential fits to the histograms were performed by a maximum likelihood fitting strategy. Values for kinetic rate constants were determined based on the relationships described by Sakmann and Trube (33Sakmann B. Trube G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 347: 659-683Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar), Gillis et al. (31Gillis K.D. Gee W.M. Hammoud A. McDaniel M.L. Falke L.C. Misler S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1119-C1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Alekseevet al. (32Alekseev A.E. Brady P.A. Terzic A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our initial characterization of sur2 included the description of an alternatively spliced coding region variant, SUR2(Δ14/39), restricted to heart expression (15Chutkow W.A. Simon M.C. Le Beau M.M. Burant C.F. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Further examination of the PCR products spanning this alternatively spliced region suggested a novel coding region variant. Primers designed to amplify from the coding region 2126–2415 bp (exons 16–21) resolved a novel product from the full-length sur2 PCR product (Fig. 1A). This smaller variant demonstrated wide tissue expression distribution in mouse and was detected in every tissue examined. It was prominent in bladder, gut, kidney, and skeletal muscle and was weakly detected in all other tissues. The sequence of this product indicated it lacked 39 bp (13 amino acids), from bp 2190 to 2229 of the sur2 coding region, corresponding precisely to a single exon, exon 17, based on the human SUR1 genomic structure. Subsequent mapping of the mouse sur2 genomic intron/exon boundaries demonstrated that the splice junction for this species indeed corresponded to exon 17, with appropriate flanking splice donor/acceptor sequences (data not shown). Previous work indicated that the beginning of exon 17 “wobbled” by ±1 amino acid, which was attributed to an alternate recognition of the splice acceptor site at the intron/exon junction.3 This is a distinct event from the alternative splicing of exon 17 we present here. Solution hybridization and RNA protection with a labeled antisense RNA probe spanning exons 13–18 (bp 1879–2254 of the coding region) was employed both to confirm the RT-PCR splicing data and to quantitate the relative mRNA tissue expression level for each of the three identified splice variants in the mouse (Fig. 1B). Digestion temperatures and RNase concentrations were varied to determine the optimal protection/digestion conditions, and relevant controls were included with each gel to ensure proper probe digestion (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). Individual variants were indicated by their predicted protected fragment sizes. A 375-nt protected fragment was present ubiquitously and represented an mRNA species containing both exons 14 and 17 which is predicted to be the full-length sur2 transcript. The exon 17 deleted variant (Δ17), 312 nt, was alternatively spliced in a number of tissues but was predominant in bladder, heart, and skeletal muscle, and the exon 14 deleted SUR2(Δ14), a 243-nt fragment, was present in heart alone. No evidence was seen that ansur2 variant exists that lacks both exons 14 and 17. This would be presented as a 179-nt fragment by RNase protection or as a 460-bp product in the previously reported RT-PCR (15Chutkow W.A. Simon M.C. Le Beau M.M. Burant C.F. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Quantitation of expression levels by phosphorimaging indicate that SUR2(Δ17) was expressed in highest levels in heart, skeletal muscle, and bladder when normalized to the β-actin loading control (n = 3 for each tissue, quantitation data not shown). In heart, full-lengthsur2 and SUR2(Δ14) were expressed at nearly similar levels. SUR2(Δ17) was the predominant species observed in skeletal muscle and in gut. In bladder, full-length sur2 was expressed at nearly equal levels as SUR2(Δ17). Modest levels ofsur2 were present in all tissues and were expressed at least 5–10-fold greater than SUR2(Δ17). Alternate sur2 CTD usage was recently demonstrated by Isomoto et al. (22Isomoto S. Kondo C. Yamada M. Matsumoto S. Higashiguchi O. Horio Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24321-24324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). We have adopted a nomenclature based on exon usage, thus isoforms SUR2A and SUR2B correspond to exons 39 and 40, respectively. Exon 40 was demonstrated to be present in all tissues and is highly homologous to the sur1 CTD. S1 nuclease protection analysis of the carboxyl-terminal alternate exon usage was employed to corroborate the results reported by Isomoto et al. (22Isomoto S. Kondo C. Yamada M. Matsumoto S. Higashiguchi O. Horio Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24321-24324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), as well as quantitatively determining which major carboxyl-terminal isoform was expressed in any single tissue. A single-stranded 32P-labeled antisense cDNA probe spanning exons 35–39 was generated and hybridized to total RNA in solution. Exon 39 variants resolved as a 378-nt fragment, whereas exon 40 species, which could not protect the last 131 nt of the probe, resulted in a 247-nt protected fragment (Fig. 1C). A second probe corresponding to a 125-bp stretch of β-actin served as a loading control. Quantitation of protected fragments by phosphorimaging (n = 2 for heart and skeletal muscle) indicated that the heart contained both exon 39 and 40 sur2 variants in nearly equal amounts, while skeletal muscle expressed approximately 2-fold greater levels of exon 39 compared with exon 40 (Fig. 1C). Weak expression of exon 39 was also noted in adipose tissue and in bladder but at much lower levels than the corresponding expression of the exon 40 variants. The exon 40 variant was present in all tissues. Demonstrating three mid-coding region sur2 splice variants (full-length, Δ14, and Δ17) and two carboxyl-terminal tails (exons 39 and 40) suggests that six possible sur2variations could be generated if the mid-coding region splice events occur independently of alternate carboxyl-tail usage. To determine if exon 14 splice variants occurred with bot"

Here we describe identification of a novel family member using a “computer cloning” strategy. Human and murine cDNA clones encoded proteins sharing 92% identity and were highly expressed in kidney. Native and recombinant protein harbored intrinsic magnesium-dependent bisphosphate nucleotidase activity (BPntase), which removed the 3′-phosphate from 3′-5′ bisphosphate nucleosides and 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate with K m and V max values of 0.5 μm and 40 μmol/min/mg. Lithium uncompetitively inhibited activity with aK i of 157 μm. Interestingly, BPntase was competitively inhibited by inositol 1,4-bisphosphate with aK i of 15 μm. Expression of mammalian BPntase complemented defects in hal2/met22 mutant yeast. These data suggest that BPntase's physiologic role in nucleotide metabolism may be regulated by inositol signaling pathways. The presence of high levels of BPntase in the kidney are provocative in light of the roles of bisphosphorylated nucleotides in regulating salt tolerance, sulfur assimilation, detoxification, and lithium toxicity. We propose that inhibition of human BPntase may account for lithium-induced nephrotoxicity, which may be overcome by supplementation of current therapeutic regimes with inhibitors of nucleotide biosynthesis, such as methionine.

Lithium is a major drug used to treat manic depression, yet its molecular mechanism of action has not been conclusively elucidated. Insight into lithium's pharmacological activity has come with the identification of a magnesium-dependent phosphomonoesterase family whose members are inhibited by lithium at subtherapeutic concentrations (1York J.D. Ponder J.W. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5149-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Despite relatively low overall sequence similarity, in some cases undetectable, the family shows a conserved three-dimensional core structure.

York and J. P. Xiong, unpublished data. Together, these data support the idea that the signature motif confers the common enzymatic characteristics of the family, including lithium sensitivity. The lithium-sensitive family includes proteins with multiple cellular roles. The roles of fbptase in gluconeogenesis, and impase and 1ptase in inositol signaling, are well established. Additionally, this family includes HAL2(MET22), SAL1, and cysQ, gene products implicated in sulfur assimilation and salt tolerance in yeast, plants, and bacteria (10Thomas D. Barbey R. Henry D.

SAL1 was identified in a screen for plant genes that produced salt tolerance in yeast (13Quintero F.J. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 529-537PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterial gene cysQ was found to be involved in the biosynthesis of cysteine (14Neuwald A.F. Krishnan B.R. Brikun I. Kulakauskas S. Suziedelis K. Tomcsanyi T. Leyh T.S. Berg D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 415-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of these proteins demonstrated a Mg2+-dependent, Li+-sensitive phosphomonoesterase activity on 3′ phosphoadenosine 5′ phosphate (PAP) and 3′ phosphoadenosine 5′ phosphosulfate (PAPS) (11Glaser H.-U.

Additionally, SAL1 has been reported (13Quintero F.J. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 529-537PubMed Google Scholar) to possess 1ptase activity which removes the 1-position phosphate from either inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (Ins(1,4)P2) or Ins(1,3,4)P3(15Inhorn R.C.

Chem. 1987; 262: 15946-15952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As SAL1 overexpression confers salt tolerance on yeast and complements the methionine auxotrophy of hal2 mutants (13Quintero F.J. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 529-537PubMed Google Scholar), roles were ascribed for both hydrolytic activities in the functioning of SAL1. Direct evidence links physiological effects of lithium to members of this phosphomonoesterase family. Treatment of cells with lithium results in accumulation of inositol mono- and polyphosphates, suggesting that impase and 1ptase are inhibited in vivo. Dichtl et al. (17Dichtl B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7184-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) recently showed that the mechanism of lithium toxicity in yeast involves inhibition of the cytosolic RNA processing enzyme Xrn1p due to the inhibition of Hal2p and subsequent accumulation of PAP. Concurrent PAP-independent lithium-mediated inhibition of RNase MRP leads to an accumulation of immature ribosomal RNA molecules (17Dichtl B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7184-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition, the data of Acharya et al.indicate that 1ptase is a target of lithium in Drosophila melanogaster (18Acharya J.K. Labarca P. Delgado R. Jalink K. Zuker C.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1219-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Defects in neuronal function observed inDrosophila 1ptase mutants were phenocopied precisely by the administration of lithium to wild-type flies (18Acharya J.K. Labarca P. Delgado R. Jalink K. Zuker C.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1219-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The conservation of the sequence motif of this family is important for identifying novel family members from human genome sequencing efforts. To this end, we have used this motif to clone a novel mammalian metal-dependent lithium-inhibited bisphosphate 3′-nucleotidase (BPntase) from expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases. Characterization and tissue distribution of a mammalian BPntase suggest that it is involved in nucleotide metabolism, sodium homeostasis, and the physiological effects of lithium. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard or by measuringA 280 (assuming an extinction coefficient of 1 cm/ml/mg). SDS-PAGE was run using the Laemmli method (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). Gels were silver-stained as described within the Silver Stain Plus system (Bio-Rad). DNA-manipulating enzymes were from Life Technologies, Inc. or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other materials were reagent grade, typically purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies were generated by injecting PAP-agarose-purified enzyme as described below into rabbits following a standard protocol (Alpha Diagnostic, San Antonio, TX). The Western blot procedure followed a standard protocol and was developed with a phosphorescent reagent activated by horseradish peroxidase conjugated to donkey-anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mouse and human EST data bases were searched with BLASTP, gapped BLASTP, or TBLASTN (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59915) Google Scholar) with appropriate query sequences. Candidate cDNAs were obtained from Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL) and completely sequenced on both strands by dideoxynucleotide chain termination (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52667) Google Scholar) with Sequenase version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and/or by fluorescent terminator sequencing (Duke University Medical Center Genome Facility, Durham, NC). Full-length mouse and human cDNA's 439033 and 645079 were obtained from Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL) as inserts in pBluescriptSK(−). The mouse coding sequence was inserted into pGEX3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate an in-frame glutathione S-transferase (GST)-439033 fusion expression construct. The pBluSK439033 plasmid was digested withDraIII and BclI, and a fragment representing residues 5–308 was purified. Residues 1–5 were rebuilt with the complementary linker oligonucleotides 5′-AATTCGGGATCCCCATCATGGCTCCAGCCACACC and 3′-GCCCTAGGGGTAGTACCGAAGGTCGGTGTGG. Triple body ligation of the 1-kb fragment, linker adapter, and pGEX3X/BamHI cut was performed to create pGEX439033. The non-fusion 439033 protein was made by generating recombinant 439033 baculovirus DNA. The baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) was digested with BamHI, and theBamHI/BclI fragment of pGEX439033 was inserted to create pVL439033. For yeast complementation studies, theBamHI-NotI fragment of pVL439033 was ligated intoBamHI/NotI-linearized pRS426GAL (23Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (obtained from Susan Wente, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) to create pRS439033, a yeast high copy plasmid with expression under control of a galactose-inducible promoter. The HAL2 coding sequence was produced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA with primers 5′-GAGCTCCCGGGTGATCATATGGCATTGGAAAGAG and 5′-GGTACCTGATCAGCGGGCCGCAAGCTTAGGCGTTTCTTGACTG as described (24$$Google Scholar). Bacterial cysQ was cloned using oligonucleotide primers 5′-CATATGTTAGATCAAGTATGCCAGC and 5′-AAGCTTCTGTTTCTGCCATCTGAATTTAG. PCR was performed in 100-μl reactions using a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 temperature cycler (Perkin-Elmer). Reactions contained 100 ng of yeast genomic DNA or approximately 104 Escherichia coli DH5α cells, 100 ng of each primer, 0.2 μl of Expand High-Fidelity Taqpolymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1× Expand PCR buffer. PCR proceeded for 30 cycles of 30 s of denaturation (94 °C), 30 s of annealing (52 °C), and 1 min of extension (72 °C). The amplified products were gel-purified and cloned into pCR2.1 using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) to create pCRHAL2 and pCRcysQ. The BclI-NotI fragment of pCRHAL2 and the BamHI-NotI fragment of pCRcysQ were cloned into BamHI/NotI-linearized pRS426GAL to create pRSHAL2 and pRScysQ. The NdeI-BclI fragment of pCRHAL2 and the NheI-BamHI fragment of pCRcysQ were isolated and ligated intoNdeI/BamHI-linearized pET11c orNheI/BamHI-linearized pET11c bacterial expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) to create pETHAL2 and pETcysQ. These plasmids were transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for overexpression. Recombinant virus was made by co-transfecting Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells (2 × 106) with 2 μg of sterile pVL439033 and 1 μg of BaculoGold baculovirus DNA (PharMingen) as described in the BaculoGold user manual. Viable, recombinant viruses were harvested 4 days after infection and amplified to a 300-ml quaternary stock in Sf9 cells. Virus stocks had an approximate titer of 1 × 108 and were stored at 4 °C. Approximately 30 ng of the 430-bpStyI fragment of the human clone 251113 was radiolabeled with [α-32P]ATP to a specific activity of approximately 1 × 109 cpm/μg as described with the Random Hexamer primer labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A human multiple tissue Northern blot, prepared with 2 μg of poly(A)-selected mRNA isolated from various tissues, was purchased fromCLONTECH. The membrane was prehybridized and hybridized at 42 °C in 10 ml of 50% formamide, 5× SSPE (0.9m NaCl, 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA), 10× Denhardt's solution, 0.1 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, 2% SDS. The membrane was washed twice with 2× standard saline citrate (SSC), 0.05% SDS at room temperature and twice with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C and then exposed to film. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with radiolabeled human actin DNA supplied with the blot. Nucleotide 3′-monophosphates (3′-AMP, -dAMP, -CMP, -GMP, -TMP, and -UMP) (Sigma) were 5′-labeled with 32P isotope by incubating an excess of the unlabeled nucleotide with [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The reaction was stopped by the addition of formate to a concentration of 0.01 m COOH, 0.5m NH4COO. The mixture was applied to a 25-μl Dowex (AG 1-X8 Resin, 200–400-mesh, formate form; Bio-Rad) column equilibrated in formate. Following extensive washing, the product was eluted with 0.03 m COOH, 1.05 mNH4COO. Ammonium formate was removed by repeated lyophilizing. PAPS (Sigma) is supplied as a lithium salt. Lithium was removed by desalting over a gravity-flow 5 × 280-mm G10-Sepharose gel filtration column equilibrated in 1 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.7, 50 mm KCl as described (25Singer S.S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 96: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Bacterial expressions were performed by growing recombinant bacteria in 1-liter cultures of LB broth (10 g/liter Bacto-tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, and 5 g/liter NaCl) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. At mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.6–1.0), cultures were induced with 0.2–0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown at 37 °C for an additional 4–6 h. Sf9 cells were maintained in spinner flasks at 28 °C in Grace's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at pH 6.1 supplemented with 3.3 g/liter yeastolate, 130 mg/liter lactalbumin hydrolysate, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) until cell densities reached 1 × 106 cells/ml (log phase). Viral infections were performed by incubating cells (1 × 109) with approximately 15 ml of virus solution for 4 h at 28 °C with periodic gentle agitation. The cells were then diluted to 1 liter with Grace's medium complete with 10% FBS. The infected cell suspension was incubated with stirring for 60 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 15 min, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were either frozen immediately at −80 °C for later use or were lysed and purified at once. Purification of the GST fusion protein was performed using glutathione agarose as described in the manual provided by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Purification of the non-fusion recombinant mouse BPntase initially involved phenyl-Sepharose high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 ml/5 g wet cells) containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cells were lysed in a French pressure cell, and cell debris was removed by centrifuging at 50,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm cellulose acetate filter and applied to Bio-Rad Q and S ion exchange cartridges connected in series and equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2 (buffer A). The flow-through and one column volume wash were collected and combined. Ammonium sulfate was added gradually to 30%, and the 50,000 × gsupernatant was applied to a 2-ml phenyl-Sepharose HPLC (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated with 30% ammonium sulfate in buffer A (buffer B). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer B, and the protein was eluted with a 15-column volume reverse linear gradient from 30% to 0% ammonium sulfate saturation in buffer A. The protein eluted in 18–22% ammonium sulfate saturation. In order to improve the yield and reliability of the purification, an affinity purification step was developed based on the enzyme's activity on PAP. PAP-agarose resin (Sigma) was swelled in PAP-agarose buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmCaCl2, and 50 mm KCl) and poured into a 10-ml disposable polypropylene chromatography column (Bio-Rad). A 1-ml bed volume was sufficient to bind up to 6 mg of enzyme. Calcium, a potent inhibitor of homologous phosphomonoesterases, was added to satisfy the metal requirement for substrate binding while preventing the hydrolysis of immobilized PAP. Cell pellets were resuspended in PAP-agarose buffer containing 1 mm PMSF, and the cells were disrupted in a French pressure cell and centrifuged as above. The supernatant was applied to the column by gravity flow, and the column was washed with 15 column volumes of PAP-agarose buffer plus 0.5 m NaCl and then reequilibrated with PAP-agarose buffer containing no additional salt. The enzyme was eluted with PAP-agarose buffer containing 300 μm 2′/3′,5′-PAP (Sigma). The protein was concentrated and the PAP removed by dialysis in Microcon centrifugal concentrators, 30,000 nominal molecular weight limit (Millipore; Bedford, MA). The protein was purified further from small molecules by size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G50 (fine) QuickSpin columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The protein was stored in 50 mmNaHEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, and 0.02% NaN3. Aliquots were frozen at −80 °C and were stable for at least 3 months with no detectable loss of activity. Native protein was also isolated with PAP-agarose affinity purification. Kidneys, lungs, liver, and heart from a freshly dissected mouse were homogenized separately with a Dounce homogenizer in 1 ml of ice-cold PAP-agarose buffer containing 1 mm PMSF. The homogenates were spun at 22,800 × g in a 4 °C microcentrifuge. The soluble fractions were applied to 50-μl PAP-agarose columns, which were washed and eluted as above. The eluants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized with silver staining and Western blotting with the anti-BPntase antibody. Eluted enzyme from the kidney preparations was pooled, and BSA was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The protein was dialyzed approximately 50,000-fold against a reaction mixture containing 50 mmNaHEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 3 mm MgCl2 (HEKM) with Microcon centrifugal concentrators (Millipore) prior to performing kinetic analyses. Purified GST-439033 fusion protein was utilized to investigate reactions catalyzed by the protein. Sequence homology with the consensus Li+-sensitive phosphomonoesterase family active site motif led us to predict that the enzyme hydrolyzed small phosphorylated molecules, possibly including inositols and nucleotides, in a Mg2+-dependent manner. Trace molar amounts of [3H] inositol standards (American Radiolabel Corp., St. Louis, MO) were incubated with protein in HEKM. Following incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 1 volume of 20 mm ammonium phosphate (AP) and was loaded onto a 4.6 × 250-mm PartiSil 10 SAX-HPLC strong anion exchange column (Whatman, Clifton, NJ). Pre-reaction inositol standards and post-reaction potential inositol products typically were separated with linear gradients from 10 mm to 1.7 m AP over 50 min. Radioactivity of the eluant was measured continuously using a Beta-RAM in-line detector (INUS Systems, Tampa, FL). Alternatively, GST-439033 was used to treat PAP and PAPS as potential substrates. Enzyme was incubated with both 10 μmunlabeled PAPS (Sigma) and approximately 105 cpm 5′-[32P]PAP. Following incubation at 37 °C in HEKM, the reaction was stopped as above and loaded onto the PartiSil 10 SAX column. In this case, the gradient used was 10 mm to 1.02m AP over 60 min. One-milliliter fractions were collected and monitored for absorbance at λ = 260 nm and then for32P radioactivity by scintillation counting. The experimental chromatogram was compared with a standard chromatogram containing commercially obtained 5′-adenosine phosphosulfate (APS), 5′-AMP, PAP, and PAPS (Sigma). Phosphatase activity was analyzed in the following manner. Unless otherwise noted, reactions were carried out in HEKM buffer containing 0.4 mg/ml BSA. For inhibitor studies, the reaction mixtures contained appropriate concentrations of LiCl, unlabeled PAPS, or unlabeled Ins(1,4)P2. Enzyme was added to reaction mixtures containing appropriate concentrations of trace-labeled 3H-inositols or 5′-32P-bisphosphorylated nucleotides. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for specific times and were stopped with 20 volumes of appropriate formate buffer (see below). The stopped reaction mixture was applied to a 200-μl bed volume of Dowex equilibrated in formate buffer. Reaction products were eluted by washing with 20 column volumes of formate buffer whereas higher phosphorylated product remained bound to the column. Quantitation of hydrolysis was performed by liquid scintillation counting of the eluent. Formate buffer for Ins(1,4)P2 assays contained 0.05 mNH4COO, 0.1 m COOH. For Ins(1,3,4)P3 experiments, formate buffer consisted of 0.35m NH4COO, 0.01 m COOH. PAP formate buffer consisted of 0.137 m NH4COO, 0.273m COOH. Yeast were propagated in standard rich (YPD) medium, or in complete minimal (CM) medium lacking appropriate nutrients to maintain plasmids. The entireHAL2 open reading frame was disrupted from S. cerevisiae W303 and replaced with LEU2. LEU2 was amplified from pRS305 (23Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by PCR with the sense primer 5′-GGCATTGGAAAGAGAATTATTGGTTGCAACTCAAGCTGTACGAAACAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGC and the antisense primer 5′-GGCGTTTCTTGACTGAATGACATCGCATGATGTAGACACCACCAACCTTACGCATCTGTGCGG (where underlined bases correspond to the HAL2 coding sequence and the remainder is common to the pRS series of plasmids). The resulting hal2::LEU2 PCR product was transformed into diploid strain W303 (MAT a/MATα), and stable transformants were selected on defined media plates lacking leucine as described (26Stolz L.E. Huynh C.V. Thorner J. York J.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1715-1729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene disruption was confirmed by PCR using a sense primer complementary to the chromosomal region 5′ of theHAL2 locus (5′-GACCAGCAATATCACCTGTTG) and an antisense primer corresponding to a sequence in LEU2(5′-CCATGCCACGGTTCTGCTC). Heterozygous diploids were sporulated and dissected as described (26Stolz L.E. Huynh C.V. Thorner J. York J.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1715-1729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thehal2::LEU2 spores segregated 2:2 (data not shown) and were identified by growth on –Leu as well as PCR analysis as above. Complementation analysis of the methionine auxotrophy ofhal2::LEU2 was performed by transforming appropriate plasmids into haploid yeast containing the disruption using a standard lithium acetate protocol (24$$Google Scholar). Cells were grown initially in CM-ura containing the non-repressing sugar raffinose (2% w/v) and induced at mid-log phase by the addition of 2% galactose. Cells were counted with a hematocytometer and inoculated into CM-ura lacking methionine at 104 cells/ml. Cells were grown with shaking at 30 °C, and growth was determined by measuring OD600. The wealth of sequence information obtained through genome and EST data bases has been invaluable in identifying and extending protein families. In order to “computer clone” novel members of the structurally conserved lithium-sensitive phosphomonoesterase protein family, basic local sequence alignment tool (BLAST) (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59915) Google Scholar) comparisons were initiated. A query sequence of human 1ptase (accession number L08488) was used to search human and mouse EST data bases specifically looking for conservation of the motif “D-Xn-EE-Xn-DP(i,l)D(g,s)T-Xn-WD-X 11-GG,” which contains the signature residues important for metal/lithium binding and catalysis. A partial sequence of the murine EST clone 439033, accession number AA008240, was found to have weak similarity to 1ptase and contained part of the above motif, “D-Xn-EE-Xn-DPlDgT.” The entire 439033 cDNA clone was sequenced and found to be 1.4 kb and had a predicted open reading frame of 308 amino acids (data not shown; deposited into GenBank accession number AF125043). Importantly, the coding sequence was found to also contain the “WD-X 11-GG” motif, indicating that it is abona fide member of this family. In addition, several truncated human clones were initially found, and subsequent searches have identified a full-length human cDNA, clone 645079, that has a length of 2.1 kb and a predicted coding sequence of 309 amino acids (deposited into Genbank accession number AF125042). Polyadenylation signals and An tails were found indicating the 3"
https://openalex.org/W2076330933,"A putative adipocyte-specific enhancer has been mapped to approximately 1 kilobase pair upstream of the cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene. In the present study, we used transgenic mice to identify and characterize the 413-base pair (bp) region between −1242 and −828 bp as a bona fide adipocyte-specific enhancer in vivo. This enhancer functioned most efficiently in the context of the PEPCK promoter. The nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) are required for enhancer function in vivo because: 1) a 3-bp mutation in the PPARγ-/RXR-binding element centered at −992 bp, PCK2, completely abolished transgene expression in adipose tissue; and 2) electrophoretic mobility supershift experiments with specific antibodies indicated that PPARγ and RXR are the only factors in adipocyte nuclear extracts which bind PCK2. In contrast, a second PPARγ/RXR-binding element centered at −446 bp, PCK1, is not involved in adipocyte specificity because inactivation of this site did not affect transgene expression. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift experiments indicated that, unlike PCK2, PCK1 is not selective for PPARγ/RXR binding. To characterize the enhancer further, the rat and human PEPCK 5′-flanking DNA sequences were compared by computer and found to have significant similarities in the enhancer region. This high level of conservation suggests that additional transcription factors are probably involved in enhancer function. A putative human PCK2 element was identified by this sequence comparison. The human and rat PCK2 elements bound PPARγ/RXR with the same affinities. This work provides the first in vivo evidence that the binding of PPARγ to its target sequences is absolutely required for adipocyte-specific gene expression.

The cytosolic isozyme of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK, 1The abbreviation used is: PEPCK, cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; bp, base pair(s); PPAR(s), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor(s); RXR, 9-cis-retenoic acid receptor; DR1, single-spaced direct repeat; hGH, human growth hormone; hGX, frameshift mutant of hGH encoding a biologically inactive protein; bGH, bovine growth hormone. EC 4.1.1.32) catalyzes the interconversion of oxaloacetate and phosphoenolpyruvate in adipose tissue and liver, yet PEPCK plays differing roles in the two tissues (1Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 2Tilghman S.M. Ballard F.J. Hanson R.W. Hanson R.W. Mehlman M.A. Gluconeogenesis: Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. John Wiley and Sons, New York1976: 47-91Google Scholar). In liver, PEPCK is a rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzyme. However, white adipose tissue is not gluconeogenic because adipocytes do not express glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, the enzymes that catalyze the two final steps of gluconeogenesis (2Tilghman S.M. Ballard F.J. Hanson R.W. Hanson R.W. Mehlman M.A. Gluconeogenesis: Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. John Wiley and Sons, New York1976: 47-91Google Scholar). Radioactive tracer studies in white adipose tissue indicate that PEPCK is involved in glyceroneogenesis, the synthesis of glycerol 3-phosphate from gluconeogenic precursors during fasting (1Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 2Tilghman S.M. Ballard F.J. Hanson R.W. Hanson R.W. Mehlman M.A. Gluconeogenesis: Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. John Wiley and Sons, New York1976: 47-91Google Scholar, 3Hanson R.W. Garber A.J. Reshef L. Ballard F.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1973; 26: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Both pathways are induced during fasting, and both are involved in fuel release but in contrasting ways. During a fast, gluconeogenesis provides a supply of glucose, whereas glyceroneogenesis is believed to prevent an all-out release of triglycerides liberated by lipolysis in white adipocytes (3Hanson R.W. Garber A.J. Reshef L. Ballard F.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1973; 26: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The role of glyceroneogenesis can be illustrated by comparing the sources of precursors for triglyceride synthesis during feeding and fasting. During feeding, triglycerides are synthesized from dietary fatty acids and glycerol-3-P, a metabolite of dietary glucose. During fasting, a large fraction of the fatty acids released from triglycerides by lipolysis is reesterified with glycerol-3-P in what appears to be a futile cycle of triglyceride degradation and resynthesis (3Hanson R.W. Garber A.J. Reshef L. Ballard F.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1973; 26: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Indeed, lipolysis and fatty acid reesterification are both induced during fasting, but a net release of free fatty acids does occur. Because fat cells do not express glycerol kinase they cannot phosphorylate the glycerol released from triglycerides (4Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3354-3358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence the glycerol-3-P needed for fatty acid reesterification is derived from gluconeogenic precursors via glyceroneogenesis. This reesterification of fatty acids probably prevents ketogenesis during fasting (5Reshef L. Hanson R.W. Ballard F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5979-5984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diabetic ketoacidosis provides an example of the problems that occur with an unregulated release of fatty acids from adipocytes. Since PEPCK and glyceroneogenesis are induced proportionately as a result of the hormonal milieu of fasting, it was proposed that PEPCK is the rate-limiting glyceroneogenic enzyme (2Tilghman S.M. Ballard F.J. Hanson R.W. Hanson R.W. Mehlman M.A. Gluconeogenesis: Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. John Wiley and Sons, New York1976: 47-91Google Scholar, 5Reshef L. Hanson R.W. Ballard F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5979-5984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because PEPCK plays different metabolic roles in white adipose tissue and liver we hypothesized that it might be regulated by distinct tissue-specific mechanisms in these two tissues. Extensive work focused upon PEPCK regulation in hepatocytes has revealed that transcription of the gene is under developmental and hormonal control via a complex upstream region within 600 bp of the promoter (1Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 6Beale E.G. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3330-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Much less effort has been directed toward understanding how PEPCK is regulated in adipocytes, but the available data indicate that it is quite different from the mechanisms in hepatocytes. We reported previously that PEPCK DNA upstream of −888 bp is required for expression of the PEPCK promoter in white adipose tissue of transgenic mice (7Short M.K. Clouthier D.E. Schaefer I.M. Hammer R.E. Magnuson M.A. Beale E.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast, normal expression of the PEPCK promoter in liver was obtained with DNA elements downstream of −600 bp of the promoter (7Short M.K. Clouthier D.E. Schaefer I.M. Hammer R.E. Magnuson M.A. Beale E.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These observations and the fact that the PEPCK gene is a single-copy gene that is transcribed from the same promoter in both tissues indicate that there are separate and distinct hepatocyte- and adipocyte-specific enhancers that control PEPCK gene transcription (6Beale E.G. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3330-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The family of orphan nuclear receptors, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), were discovered during the past decade (8Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Briefly, these transcription factors are activated by various hyperlipidemic drugs, xenobiotic compounds, fatty acids and their metabolites, and they regulate genes encoding proteins involved in lipid metabolism (8Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In mammalian species there are three PPAR subfamilies: PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ. All three PPARs activate genes through their binding (as heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXR)) to single-spaced direct repeat (DR1) hormone response elements (5′-AGGTCANAGGTCA-3′) (8Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). PPARα is most abundant in the liver and in various cells of the immune system where leukotriene B4 has been shown to be a natural activating ligand (9Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). PPARβ is ubiquitous in its distribution, but its function and natural activating ligands are unknown (8Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Recent investigations have shown that PPARγ is most abundant in adipose tissue and activated macrophages (10Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). It is a key factor responsible for differentiation of the adipocyte lineage during development (for review, see Ref. 10Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar), and it is antiinflammatory and causes apoptosis in macrophages (11Chinetti G. Griglio S. Antonucci M.

Its activating ligands include the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs and the natural compound, 15-deoxy Δ12,14 prostaglandin J2(12Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M.

Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). The prototype adipocyte-specific enhancer is located 5 kilobase pairs upstream of the aP2 promoter and is activated by PPARγ/RXR via two DR1 elements (14Ross S.R. Graves R.A. Greenstein A. Platt K.A. Shyu H.-L. Mellovitz B. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9590-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We subsequently found two PPARγ/RXR binding sites, designated PCK1 and PCK2, upstream of the PEPCK promoter (15Tontonoz P. Hu E. Devine J. Beale E.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCK1 is centered at −446 bp, and PCK2 is at −992 bp, which is within the region required for PEPCK activation in adipocytes. Transient transfection assays in 3T3-F442A adipogenic cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts showed that PCK2 is essential for differentiation-dependent enhancer activity and for transactivation by PPARγ/RXR (15Tontonoz P. Hu E. Devine J. Beale E.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to determine whether the region of PEPCK DNA upstream of −888 bp constitutes a bona fideadipocyte-specific enhancer and whether PCK2 is required for its activity in transgenic mice. We also asked whether the proximal DR1 element, PCK1, is important for adipocyte-specific expression of the PEPCK gene. We have identified the 413-bp region between −1242 and −828 bp as an adipocyte-specific enhancer. This enhancer requires an intact PCK2 element, and it functions most efficiently in the context of the PEPCK promoter, suggesting that there are gene- and/or tissue-specific interactions between PPARγ and other factors involved in regulating transcription. This work provides the first evidence that PPARγ is required for adipogenic gene expression in vivo. The nine transgene constructs utilized in this study are illustrated in Figs. 1A, 2A, and 3. All of the constructs were prepared by standard techniques from the rat PEPCK genomic DNA clone, λPC112, described previously (16Beale E.G. Chrapkiewicz N.B. Scoble H.A. Metz R.J. Quick D.P.

The −5000 hGH construct is anEcoRI-BglII fragment extending from −5000 bp to +69 bp inserted into the hGH vector, p0GH (17Selden R.F. Howie K.B. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), digested withEcoRI and BamHI. The −2086 hGH construct, which has been described before (7Short M.K. Clouthier D.E. Schaefer I.M. Hammer R.E. Magnuson M.A. Beale E.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), is a −2086 bp to +69 bpSstI-BglII fragment inserted into p0GH. The −888 hGH construct, also described previously (7Short M.K. Clouthier D.E. Schaefer I.M. Hammer R.E. Magnuson M.A. Beale E.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), is a −888 bp to +69 bp Bal-31 deletion end point BglII fragment inserted into p0GH. The remaining six constructs all utilized hGX as the reporter (18Idzerda R.L. Behringer R.R. Theisen M. Huggenvik J.I. McKnight G.S. Brinster R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5154-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This reporter was made by generating a frameshift mutation in the translated sequence of hGH such that the encoded protein is biologically inactive (18Idzerda R.L. Behringer R.R. Theisen M. Huggenvik J.I. McKnight G.S. Brinster R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5154-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The −2086 hGX construct is identical to the −2086 hGH construct except for the hGX mutation in the reporter. The −1330 hGX construct is identical except that it terminates at aBsmI site at −1330 bp. The “Enhancer hGX” construct is a −1240 to −830 bp TaqI-BamHI fragment joined to the hGX gene at −90 bp. The promoter in this vector is therefore a minimal promoter (extending to −90 bp) from the hGH gene. Finally, the three genes bearing PPARγ/RXR binding site mutations, PCK2M, PCK1M, and PCK1+2M, were all generated from the −2086 hGX construct. The PCK2 mutation (PCK2M) was inserted by swapping a −2086 bp to −14 bpSalI-NheI fragment from a PCK2M-CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) construct (15Tontonoz P. Hu E. Devine J. Beale E.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the same fragment in −2086 hGX. The sequence of PCK2M was 5′-GGGATCCTGGTCT-3′, whereas the wild type PCK2 sequence is 5′-GGGATAAAGGTCT-3′ (the mutated sequences are underlined). PCK1M was introduced via site-directed mutagenesis as described by Kunkelet al. (19Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). The sequence of PCK1M was 5′-TGACGATCGGCCG-3′, whereas the wild type PCK1 sequence is 5′-TGACCTTTGGCCG-3′ (note that this DR1 is in the opposite orientation from PCK2). In every case, the transgenes were digested and gel purified from plasmid vectors prior to injection of DNA into fertilized mouse eggs as we described previously (7Short M.K. Clouthier D.E.

Total RNA was extracted from the frozen tissues by the acid-guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol method (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) using Tri-Reagent™ (Molecular Research Laboratories, Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PEPCK and hGH or hGX mRNAs were then assayed by either one of two methods. The first method was a solution hybridization-RNase protection assay described previously (7Short M.K. Clouthier D.E. Schaefer I.M. Hammer R.E. Magnuson M.A. Beale E.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Durnam D.M. Palmiter R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) which was designed to assess the average number of mRNA molecules/cell. Briefly, the hybridized, RNase-resistant probe was collected by filtration of a trichloroacetic acid precipitate. Filter-bound radioactivity was then measured by scintillation counting. The molar amount of mRNA was calculated by comparison with a standard curve prepared using known amounts of pure target RNA (PEPCK or hGH). The second method was a standard RNase protection assay utilizing a kit purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This method is more sensitive and allowed for the simultaneous assay of PEPCK, hGH (or hGX), and β-actin mRNAs in a single tube. The cRNA probes were the same for the two different RNase protection assays. The mouse PEPCK probe was transcribed from pmPCR10 using T3 RNA polymerase to synthesize an antisense RNA from aHindIII-digested template. The cRNA product is 411 bp in length, whereas the RNase-protected product is a 326-bp fragment. It was necessary to construct pmPCR10 for these experiments because a mouse PEPCK cDNA had not previously been cloned, and the rat PEPCK cDNAs, although more than 95% identical to mouse PEPCK, were not suitable for RNase protection assays. Polymerase chain reaction primers were designed by comparison of the sequences for rat, human, and chicken PEPCK cDNAs and searching for identical regions. Forward (5′-ATGCGGCCCTTCTTTGGCTA-3′) and reverse (5′-TCCACCTCCTTCTCCCAGAA-3′) polymerase chain reaction primers were selected and used to amplify mouse genomic DNA. A single product of the predicted size (326 bp) was obtained and inserted into the EcoRV site of pBluescript IISK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This sequence corresponds to nucleotides 394–719 in the translated sequence from exon 10 of the rat PEPCK gene. The cDNA, phGHex2, used for assay of hGH and hGX mRNAs was constructed from a region of exon 2/intron 2 (nucleotides 833–1011, 989–1011 is intron 2). The hGH/hGX cRNA probe was transcribed from phGHex2 using T3 RNA polymerase to synthesize an antisense RNA from aXhoI-digested template. The hGH cRNA transcript is 272 bp in length, whereas the RNase-protected product is a 156-bp fragment. The β-actin probe was supplied in the RNase protection assay kit from Ambion. The β-actin cRNA transcript is 133 bp in length, whereas the RNase-protected product is a 161-bp fragment. In vitro translation of RXRα-SPORT and PPARγ2-SPORT (15Tontonoz P. Hu E. Devine J. Beale E.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) plasmids was performed with the TNT SP6-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. 1 μl of the 50-μl translation product was used in each binding reaction. 3T3-L1 preadipocyte and adipocyte nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously, except that extracts were not dialyzed but were added directly to the binding reaction mixture (15Tontonoz P. Hu E. Devine J. Beale E.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Final protein concentrations were typically 1–2 μg/μl. DNA-protein binding assays were performed in 15-μl incubations as described by Bretzet al. (22Bretz J.D. Williams S.C. Baer M. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7306-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts and/or recombinant proteins were incubated in a reaction buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 4% Ficoll, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), unlabeled double-stranded competitor DNA (where specified), and 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Sigma). These reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min before the addition of 4 pmol of a 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA probe followed by a second 15-min incubation. The rat PCK2 probe was prepared as follows. A synthetic double-stranded DNA oligomer (sense strand, 5′-GATCACAACTGGGATAAAGGTCTCG-3′; antisense strand, 5′-GATCCGAGACCTTTATCCCAGTTGT-3′) was end labeled by filling the 3′-recessed ends with [α-32P] dGTP (DuPont Easytides, 800 Ci/mmol) using the large fragment ofEscherichia coli polymerase I (Klenow fragment). The unlabeled rat PCK2 double-stranded oligonucleotide probe thus includes the 13-bp DR1 sequence, six 5′- and two 3′-flanking bp, plusBamHI-compatible extensions at both ends. The human PCK2 and rat PCK1 probes were prepared in the same manner. Their sequences were as follows. Human PCK2 sense: 5′-GATCACAACTGTTATAAAGGTTTCA-3′ Human PCK2 antisense: 5′-GATCTGAAACCTTTATAACAGTTGT-3′ Rat PCK1 sense: 5′-GATCCATGACCTTTGGCCGTGGGAG-3′ Rat PCK1 antisense: 5′-GATCCTCCCACGGCCAAAGGTCATG-3′ When antiserum was used, binding reactions were incubated with antiserum during the 15 min prior to the addition of the labeled DNA. Sera used included: 1) polyclonal rabbit anti-human RXRα (directed against amino acids 214–229) obtained from R. Evans, Salk Institute (23Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1448-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar); 2) polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse PPARγ2 described previously (24Vidal-Puig A. Jimenez-Linan M. Lowell B.B. Hamann A. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Flier J.S. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2553-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar); and 3) normal rabbit serum purchased from Sigma. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels (30:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 0.5 × TBE (1 × TBE, 50 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 1 mm EDTA). The gels were dried and exposed to a Phosphor screen overnight. Quantitation was performed with a PhosphorImaging device (Molecular Dynamics). The rat adipocyte-specific enhancer was sequenced on an automated sequenator from Applied Biosystems in the Institute for Biotechnology Core Laboratory, Texas Tech University. Both DNA strands were sequenced in their entirety. All computer analyses were performed using the Wisconsin Package Version 9.0 software, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI. In a previous study using transgenic mice we utilized the hGH gene as the reporter to define tissue-specific elements upstream of the PEPCK promoter (7Short M.K. Clouthier D.E. Schaefer I.M. Hammer R.E. Magnuson M.A. Beale E.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A comparison of endogenous PEPCK expression in tissues of normal versus transgenic animals indicated that the high serum concentrations of hGH did not affect transgene expression (7Short M.K. Clouthier D.E. Schaefer I.M. Hammer R.E. Magnuson M.A. Beale E.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, a similar study was reported by McGrane et al. (25McGrane M.M. Yun J.S. Moorman A.F.M. Lamers W.H. Hendrick G.K. Arafah B.M. Park E.A. Wagner T.E. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22371-22379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who used bovine growth hormone (bGH) as the reporter. Serum bGH, at high concentrations, caused hyperinsulinemia and significantly repressed both endogenous PEPCK and transgene expression in their mice. Although we did not observe a similar effect with hGH, the use of a biologically active hormone as reporter risks introducing artifacts. We therefore obtained hGX, a reporter encoding a biologically inactive mutant form of hGH, from Dr. Stanley McKnight (18Idzerda R.L. Behringer R.R. Theisen M. Huggenvik J.I. McKnight G.S. Brinster R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5154-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We used hGX to produce new transgenic mice in which the rat PEPCK promoter was identical to the −2086 to +69 bp construct that we used previously (7Short M.K. Clouthier D.E. Schaefer I.M. Hammer R.E. Magnuson M.A. Beale E.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The two “−2086” transgene constructs are shown in Fig. 1A. Transgene expression in white adipose tissue and liver of these two groups of mice was measured by quantitative solution hybridization assay, and the results are shown in Table I and Fig. 1, B and C. There was no statistically significant difference in transgene expression between the hGH and the hGX group in either liver or adipose tissue (p = 0.65 and 0.28 for liver and adipose tissue, respectively). This supports our previous conclusion that hGH does not confound the conclusions and demonstrates that comparisons between hGX and hGH transgenes are valid. It does appear that there could be a slight, albeit statistically insignificant, inhibitory effect of ex"
https://openalex.org/W1487672819,"α-tocopherol, the most potent antioxidant form of vitamin E, is mainly bound to lipoproteins in plasma and its incorporation into the vascular wall can prevent the endothelium dysfunction at an early stage of atherogenesis. In the present study, the plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) was shown to promote the net mass transfer of α-tocopherol from high density lipoproteins (HDL) and α-tocopherol-albumin complexes toward α-to-copherol-depleted, oxidized low density lipoproteins (LDL). The facilitated transfer reaction of α-tocopherol could be blocked by specific anti-PLTP antibodies. These observations indicate that PLTP may restore the antioxidant potential of plasma LDL at an early stage of the oxidation cascade that subsequently leads to cellular damages. In addition, the present study demonstrated that the PLTP-mediated net mass transfer of α-tocopherol can constitute a new mechanism for the incorporation of α-tocopherol into the vascular wall in addition to the previously recognized LDL receptor and lipoprotein lipase pathways. In ex vivo studies on rabbit aortic segments, the impairment of the endothelium-dependent arterial relaxation induced by oxidized LDL was found to be counteracted by a pretreatment with purified PLTP and α-tocopherol-albumin complexes, and both the maximal response and the sensitivity to acetylcholine were significantly improved. We conclude that PLTP, by supplying oxidized LDL and endothelial cells with α-tocopherol through a net mass transfer reaction may play at least two distinct beneficial roles in preventing endothelium damage, i.e., the antioxidant protection of LDL and the preservation of a normal relaxing function of vascular endothelial cells.—Desrumaux, C., Deckert, V., Athias, A., Masson, D., Lizard, G., Palleau, V., Gambert, P., Lagrost, L.

https://openalex.org/W1991971532,"Small cytoplasmic RNA (scRNA) is metabolically stable and abundant in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> cells. Consisting of 271 nucleotides, it is structurally homologous to mammalian signal recognition particle RNA. In contrast to 4.5 S RNA of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>B. subtilis</i> scRNA contains an <i>Alu</i>domain in addition to the evolutionarily conserved S domain. In this study, we show that a 10-kDa protein in <i>B. subtilis</i> cell extracts has scRNA binding activity at the <i>Alu</i> domain. The<i>in vitro</i> binding selectivity of the 10-kDa protein shows that it recognizes the higher structure of the <i>Alu</i> domain of scRNA caused by five consecutive complementary sequences in the two loops. Purification and subsequent analyses demonstrated that the 10-kDa protein is HBsu, which was originally identified as a member of the histone-like protein family. By constructing a HBsu-deficient<i>B. subtilis</i> mutant, we showed that HBsu is essential for normal growth. Immunoprecipitating cell lysates using anti-HBsu antibody yielded scRNA. Moreover, the co-precipitation of HBsu with (His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged Ffh depended on the presence of scRNA, suggesting that HBsu, Ffh, and scRNA make a ternary complex and that scRNA serves as a functional unit for binding. These results demonstrated that HBsu is the third component of a signal recognition particle-like particle in <i>B. subtilis</i> that can bind the<i>Alu</i> domain of scRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1561745055,"Activation of heat shock factor (HSF) 1-DNA binding and inducible heat shock protein (hsp) 70 (also called hsp72) expression enables cells to resist various forms of stress and survive. Fas, a membrane-bound protein, is a central proapoptotic factor; its activation leads to a cascade of events, resulting in programmed cell death. These two mechanisms with contradictory functions, promoting either cell survival or death, were examined for their potential to inhibit each other's activation. Induction of FAS-mediated signaling was followed by a rapid decrease in HSF1-DNA binding and inducible hsp70 expression. Inhibition of HSF1-DNA binding was demonstrated to be based on absent hyperphosphorylation of HSF1 during FAS signaling. These effects of FAS activation on the HSF1/hsp70 stress response were blocked by ICE (caspase 1) inhibitors, suggesting an ICE-mediated process. Furthermore, inhibition of HSF1/hsp70 was accompanied by an increase in apoptosis rates from 20% to 50% in response to heat stress. When analyzing the effects of HSF1/hsp70 activation on Fas-mediated apoptosis, protection from apoptosis was seen in cells with induced hsp70 protein levels, but not in cells that were just induced for HSF1-DNA binding. Thus, we conclude that inhibition of HSF1/hsp70 stress response during Fas-mediated apoptosis and vice versa may facilitate a cell to pass a previously chosen pathway, stress resistance or apoptosis, without the influence of inhibitory signals."

Also, a ribozyme study by Wang et al. (4Wang Q. Mullah B. Hansen C. Asundi J. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol.

Taken together, these in vivo studies indicate that the composition of the βγ dimer has important ramifications for the fidelity of signaling that is probably manifested at the level of the receptor. A growing body of in vitro evidence supports a direct interaction between the receptor and the βγ dimer (5Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 452-460PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, direct interaction of transducin βγ with rhodopsin has been shown with a fluorescence energy transfer technique (6Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17032-17039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This association was blocked by a synthetic peptide derived from the carboxyl-terminal tail of rhodopsin, suggesting a site of direct contact between βγ and rhodopsin. Moreover, cross-linking studies have confirmed a receptor contact site on the β subunit. A synthetic peptide derived from the carboxyl-terminal portion of the putative third cytoplasmic loop of the α2A-AR could be cross-linked to the carboxyl-terminal region of the β subunit (7Taylor J.M.

Among the two β subtypes or eight γ subtypes tested, 30-fold differences were observed in their relative abilities to support coupling of the same α subunit to the recombinant α2A-adrenergic receptor. These data demonstrate that the specificity of α2-adrenergic receptor-G protein interactions is affected by the βγ dimer composition. A pVL1392 transfer vector containing α2A-adrenergic receptor cDNA was generously provided by Dr. H. Kurose and R. Lefkowitz (Duke University, Durham, NC). Recombinant baculovirus encoding the α2A-adrenergic receptor was generated by co-transfection of α2A-pVL1392 with a linearized lethal deletion mutant of Autographa californica as directed by the supplier (BaculoGold, PharMingen Corp.). Expression by recombinant baculovirus was identified by specific binding of the α2-adrenergic radioligand, [3H]yohimbine (described below). A positive recombinant was isolated through four rounds of plaque purification. Receptors were expressed by inoculating Sf9 insect cells at an m.o.i. of 1 in IPL-41 medium, 1× lipid concentrate, and 1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. After 72 h, cell pellets were lysed by nitrogen cavitation (500 pounds/square inch for 30 min at 4 °C) in 100 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.03 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm benzamidine) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 600 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended, washed once in lysis buffer (40,000 ×g, 40 min), and resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer. Protein concentration was determined by Coomassie assay (Pierce). Particulate fraction protein was snap-frozen with liquid N2in aliquots of 300 μg each and stored at −80 °C. Receptor expression was quantitated by saturation binding of [3H]yohimbine, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A single 500-ml expression culture yielded adequate material to carry out all of the reconstitution experiments. Recombinant baculoviruses directing the expression of β1, γ1, γ2, γ3, γ5, and γ7 recombinant baculovirus were described previously (16Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

In these cases, recombinant baculoviruses were obtained by co-transfection of Sf9 insect cells with pVL1393 transfer vectors containing β3, γ4, γ10, or γ11 and a linearized lethal deletion mutant of A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus as directed by the supplier (BaculoGold, PharMingen). Recombinant viruses were identified by immunoblotting Sf9 cell lysates for expression of the appropriate subunits. Subtype-specific antibodies were generated as described previously (20Robishaw J.D. Balceuva E.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 498Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) using the following synthetic peptides: γ4, CKEGMSNNSTTSIS (amino acids 2–14); γ10, CKDALLVGVPAGSNPFREPR (amino acids 45–63); and γ11, CPALHIEDLPEK (amino acids 2–12). Other subtype-specific antibodies have been described previously (20Robishaw J.D. Balceuva E.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 498Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 21Peng Y.-W. Robishaw J.D.

Recombinant virus encoding Gαi1 containing a hexahistidine tag at amino acid position 121 was kindly provided by Dr. T. Kozasa (Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). One-liter cultures of Sf9 insect cells in IPL-41 medium, 1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 1× lipid mix (Life Technologies, Inc.) were inoculated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml simultaneously with recombinant baculoviruses encoding α, β, and γ subunits as follows: 6hisαi1 at m.o.i. = 2, β1 or β3 at m.o.i. = 3, and each of the γ subtypes at m.o.i. = 3. Under this condition, those γ subtypes predicted to contain a C-20 geranylgeranyl group are appropriately modified. However, those few γ subtypes predicted to contain a C-15 farnesyl group are variably modified at high levels of protein expression (10Kalman V.K. Erdman R. Maltese W.A. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14835-14841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, to optimize the addition of a C-15 farnesyl moiety, cultures of Sf9 cells expressing the γ1and γ11 subtypes were also infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding both subunits of the mammalian farnesyltransferase at m.o.i. = 0.2. This virus was kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Kost (Glaxo Corp.). Cultures of Sf9 cells infected with the farnesyltransferase virus displayed greater than 15-fold higher activity toward the Ha-Ras fusion protein substrate than cultures not so infected. Moreover, cultures of Sf9 cells infected with the farnesyltransferase virus resulted in the majority of the γ1 and γ11 subtypes being modified with the C-15 farnesyl moiety, as shown previously (10Kalman V.K. Erdman R. Maltese W.A. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14835-14841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Expression of G protein β and γ subunits in particulate fractions was confirmed 72 h later by immunoblotting with subtype-specific antibodies (22Robishaw J.D. Balcueva E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recombinant βγ heterodimers were purified to apparent homogeneity using the procedure described by Kozasa and Gilman (11Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) for purification of β1γ2. Following cholate extraction of particulate fractions, the cholate-soluble protein was diluted to 0.2% sodium cholate with 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm GDP, and 0.5% polyoxyethylene 10-lauryl ether. The cholate-soluble extract was loaded onto a 4-ml Ni-NTA resin bed at 3–4-bed volumes/h (4 °C) and washed with 100 ml of the same buffer containing 300 mm NaCl and 5 mm imidazole. βγ dimers were eluted from the column by activation of 6hisαβγ with AMF (30 μmAlCl3, 50 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm NaF)-containing buffer: 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm GDP, 1% sodium cholate, 5 mm imidazole, 50 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, and 30 μm AlCl3. The peak βγ-containing fractions were identified by immunoblotting for both β and γ subunits and then pooled and diluted to less than 10 mmNaCl using 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm DTT, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.7% CHAPS. βγ subunits were further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, HR 5/5) eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 400 mm. Peak fractions were again confirmed by immunoblotting. The elution peaks were pooled and dialyzed overnight (3 buffer changes) against 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mmDTT, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.7% CHAPS (Spectra/Por tubing, 6000–8000 molecular weight cut-off, Spectrum Medical Industries, Houston, TX). A mixture of βγ subunits purified from bovine brain by a previously described method (23Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was also further purified on a Mono Q column by the same procedure. Following dialysis, purified βγ subunits were concentrated to approximately 0.1 mg/ml in an Amicon ultrafiltration device (PM10 membrane), and the final protein concentrations were determined by staining with Amido Black. Purified βγ subunits were snap-frozen in small aliquots with liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. The 6hisαi1 subunit was expressed alone (m.o.i. = 3) in a 1-liter culture of Sf9 insect cells for subsequent purification. Protein extraction, loading, and washing of the Ni-NTA column were identical to that described for βγ subunits. The 6hisαi1 was eluted from the Ni-NTA column with the following buffer, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5% polyoxyethylene 10-lauryl ether, 10 μm GDP, and 150 mm imidazole, and was subsequently purified further on a Mono Q column (fast protein liquid chromatography) using the same procedure described for βγ subunits with the exception that collection tubes contained an aliquot of GDP to yield a final concentration of 10 μm GDP in each of the column fractions. Subsequent handling of6hisαi1 was identical to βγ subunits. Purified α and βγ subunits were combined in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm DTT, 10 μm GDP, 0.02% sodium cholate to allow formation of G protein heterotrimers of defined subtype composition. The mixture was incubated in a total volume of 30 μl on ice prior to reconstituting the G proteins into Sf9 cell plasma membranes. An aliquot of the Sf9 membrane preparation expressing α2A-adrenergic receptor was thawed and diluted to approximately 0.5 mg of protein/ml in 25 mmTris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin; then Gi heterotrimers were added to the membranes at the desired ratio of G protein to receptor and incubated on ice for 30 min prior to receptor binding assays. The CHAPS concentration during this incubation was ≤0.04%. To assess the relative affinities of the various βγ dimers for the α subunit, 330 ng of the various purified β1γ dimers were combined with 500 ng of purified 6hisαi1 at a final ratio of 50:75 (mol:mol) of βγ:α. At this ratio, differences in the relative affinities of certain βγ dimers for the receptor were detected. As described previously (24Casey P.J. Pang I.-H. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 195: 315-321Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), incubation of the resulting Giheterotrimers was carried out in the presence of 200 ng of islet activating protein and [32P]NAD at 30 °C for 20 min and then terminated by precipitation with 30% trichloroacetic acid followed by rapid filtration over BA85 nitrocellulose filters. ADP-ribosylation of 6hisαi1 was measured by scintillation counting to detect [32P] bound to filters. [3H]UK-14,304 and [3H]yohimbine binding incubations were carried out in a total volume of 250 μl at 24 °C for 60 min in a reaction buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2 (plus 100 mm NaCl in assays of [3H]yohimbine binding). Radioligand binding was initiated by addition of 2–10 μg of Sf9 membrane protein and terminated by addition of 3 ml of the same ice-cold reaction buffer followed by rapid filtration over Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters on a Millipore filtration apparatus. Filters were rinsed twice more with the same buffer. Bound radioligand was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman LS6500). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm yohimbine. Statistical analysis of coupling (high affinity [3H]UK-14,304 binding) supported by different γ subtypes was done by a two-tailed, Student'st test for comparison of the variation between two means, ρ ≤ 0.05 indicated statistical significance. [imidazoylyl-4,5-3H]UK-14,304, [methyl-3H]yohimbine, [32P]nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and G protein β-common antiserum (SW/1) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products; Ni-NTA-agarose was obtained from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA); oxymetazoline was obtained from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA); ECL reagent and horseradish-linked anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, UK); and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Expression of the α2A-adrenergic receptor in Sf9 insect cells was initially assessed using the antagonist [3H]yohimbine. Uninfected cells did not express the α2A-adrenergic receptor (open circles, Fig. 1A). However, a significant level of the α2A-adrenergic receptor was detected by specific [3H]yohimbine binding at 48 h after infection of cells with the α2A-AR baculovirus (filled squares, Fig. 1A). TheK D values for the recombinant receptor calculated by Scatchard analysis of the saturation binding curve ranged from 3.5 to 6 nm with B max values ranging from 2.7 to 13.3 pmol/mg protein depending on the cell preparation (inset of Fig. 1A). This K Drange of the recombinant receptor was consistent with that of the native α2A-adrenergic receptor (for review, see Ref. 25$$Google Scholar). Moreover, this moderate B max value was optimal for the purpose of this study since this level of recombinant receptor expression was readily measurable but required minimal amounts of purified G proteins for reconstitution. Finally, the properties of the recombinant α2A-adrenergic receptor were characteristic of those of the native receptor. The specific [3H]yohimbine binding showed a NaCl sensitivity that is typical of the native receptor (25$$Google Scholar), i.e. theB max binding plateau was 45–55% lower in the presence of 100 mm NaCl (data not shown). Prazosin and oxymetazoline displaced the specific [3H]yohimbine binding from the recombinant receptor with the same order of potency of the native receptor (K D values of 4 and 0.022 μm, respectively). Taken together, these data confirmed the suitability of Sf9 cells for the expression of recombinant α2A-adrenergic receptor that is functionally similar to the native receptor (26Jansson C.C. Karp M. Oker-Blom C. Nasman J. Savola J.-M. Akerman K.E.O. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 290: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Coupling of the α2A-adrenergic receptor was examined in the presence and absence of exogenous Giprotein using the agonist [3H]UK-14304. The direct agonist binding technique is generally considered to be more sensitive than agonist displacement studies for detecting receptor-G protein complexes (25$$Google Scholar). When Sf9 cell membranes expressing the recombinant α2A-adrenergic receptor were incubated in the absence of exogenous Gi protein, a low level of specific [3H]UK-14304 binding was detected, accounting for ∼15% of the binding that was later observed in the presence of added Gi protein (Fig. 2). By contrast, when Sf9 cell membranes expressing the recombinant α2A-adrenergic receptor were incubated in the presence of exogenous Gi protein (at a molar ratio of 100:1 Gi:receptor), the level of specific [3H]UK-14304 binding was increased by more than 5-fold, representing coupling of the recombinant receptor to the added Gi protein (Fig. 2). Moreover, the increased level of [3H]UK-14304 binding was reversed by the addition of GTPγS, reflecting uncoupling of the recombinant receptor from the added Gi protein. Thus, reconstituted coupling was easily distinguishable from the background coupling in this experimental system, thereby confirming the suitability of this experimental system for measuring the coupling of the recombinant receptor to added Gi proteins of varying βγ composition. For optimal resolution between the reconstituted and background coupling, a 4 nm concentration of [3H]UK 14,304 was used in subsequent experiments. The requirements of the [3H]UK-14,304 binding assay for the G protein α and βγ subunits were examined further. Consistent with previous studies of the A1 adenosine receptor (9Figler R.A. Graber S.E. Lindorfer M.A. Yasuda H. Linden J. Garrison J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1587-1595PubMed Google Scholar), the combined interaction of both the G protein α and βγ subunits was required in order to detect the high affinity state of the recombinant α2A-adrenergic receptor with this binding assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, when the recombinant receptor was reconstituted with the6hisαi1 subunit alone (at a molar ratio of 50:1 α:receptor), the level of [3H]UK-14304 binding was low and was indistinguishable from that observed with no added Gi heterotrimer. This result attests to the validity of the [3H]UK-14,304 binding assay to evaluate differences in the ability of βγ dimers of varying composition to induce the high affinity state of the recombinant receptor. Next, the recombinant receptor was reconstituted with a constant amount of6hisαi1 subunit and increasing amounts of βγ dimer. As shown in Fig. 3B, raising the amount of βγ dimer increased the fraction of receptor in the high affinity state as measured by the higher level of [3H]UK-14,304 binding. When the amounts of βγ dimer and 6hisαi1 subunit approached a 1:1 ratio, the level of [3H]UK-14,304 binding reached a plateau, accounting for ∼60% of the total receptor population as determined by [3H]yohimbine binding. A similar, maximal level of coupling was observed previously for the A1 adenosine receptor (9Figler R.A. Graber S.E. Lindorfer M.A. Yasuda H. Linden J. Garrison J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1587-1595PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that not all of the recombinant receptors are accessible for reconstitution with added G proteins. Under these conditions, any observed differences in the magnitude of [3H]UK-14,304 binding can be assumed to be attributable to selective interactions of βγ dimers of varying composition with the receptor rather than to alterations in G protein α-βγ subunit interactions. To produce recombinant βγ dimers of varying γ composition, the β1 subtype was chosen since it has previously been shown to interact with all of the γ subtypes (17Ueda N. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lee E.

The recombinant βγ dimers were purified using a procedure originally described by Kozasa and Gilman (11Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells expressing the6hisαi1, β1, and one of the following γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4, γ5, γ7, γ10, or γ11 subunits were prepared. Then, cholate-solubilized membrane extracts from these cells were bound to Ni-NTA agarose columns by virtue of the 6-histidine tag on the αi1 subunit; the βγ dimers were eluted from the columns by activating the bound heterotrimers with AMF; and the6hisαi1 subunit was subsequently eluted from the columns with high imidazole. Further purification of the recombinant βγ dimers and the 6hisαi1subunit was achieved by applying their enriched fractions from the Ni-NTA columns to Mono Q columns. The purity of the 6hisαi1 subunit was assessed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, the purified6hisαi1 preparation contained one major band of the size expected for the αi1 subunit taking into account the added amino-terminal tag. The purity of the recombinant βγ dimers was also compared by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Coomassie was used in the case of β1γ1). As shown in Fig. 4A, each purified βγ preparation was composed of two predominant bands by protein staining as follows: a 36-kDa band representing the β1 subunit, and a 5–8-kDa band representing one of the following γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4, γ5, γ7, γ10, or γ11 subunits. The identity of each βγ purified preparation was confirmed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for each γ subtype. Antibodies specific for the γ1, γ2, γ3, γ5, and γ7 subunits were used for this purpose previously (20Robishaw J.D. Balceuva E.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 498Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, antibodies specific for the newly described γ4, γ10, and γ11 subunits needed to be generated against synthetic peptides based on the unique amino acid sequences of these proteins. As shown in Fig. 4B, the identities of the purified β1γ4, β1γ10, and β1γ11 preparations were confirmed by immunoblotting with these antibodies. Gi heterotrimers of varying γ composition were tested for their relative abilities to couple with receptor as measured by the level of high affinity [3H]UK-14,304 binding. As shown in Fig. 5, all combinations of the 6hisαi1 subunit with the various βγ dimers were capable of inducing high affinity [3H]UK-14,304 binding, with the level of binding showing dependence on the γ composition. In all cases, the [3H]UK-14,304 binding was completely abolished by addition of GTPγS (data not shown). The β1γ1 dimer supported only a very low level of coupling to the recombinant α2A-adrenergic receptor. By contrast, the β1γ11 dimer produced a high level of coupling to the recombinant α2A-adrenergic receptor. Since the γ1 and γ11 subtypes are closely related, showing 76% identity (19Ray K. Kunsch C. Bonner L.M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21765-21771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the observation that they promote very different levels of coupling suggests that the relatively small number of amino acid differences between the two subtypes are important for recognition by the receptor. The β1γ2, β1γ3, β1γ4, and β1γ7dimers also produced high levels of coupling with the recombinant α2A-adrenergic receptor. These four γ subtypes are closely related, showing 66–74% homology at the amino acid level, and therefore, the finding that they produce essentially identical levels of coupling is not unexpected. Finally, the β1γ5 and β1γ10dimers yielded intermediate levels of coupling with the recombinant α2A-adrenergic receptor. These two subtypes are only distantly related, showing less than 53% homology to each other or to other γ subtypes. Taken together, these results showed measurable differences between βγ dimers of varying γ composition to support coupling of the same α subunit to the recombinant α2A-adrenergic receptor. Statistical analysis revealed the β1γ1, β1γ5, and β1γ10 dimers supported the lowest levels of coupling. Previously, several groups have reported that the β1γ1 dimer was less effective than other βγ dimers in supporting coupling to numerous receptors (8Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E.

Four structurally diverse agents, arachidonyl trifluoromethylketone, staurosporine, sodium salicylate, and C6-ceramide, were studied. All four agents caused EC apoptosis at concentrations that inhibited TNF-induced IκBα degradation. However, evidence of apoptosis was not evident until after several (e.g. 3–12) hours of treatment, whereas 2 h of treatment was sufficient to inhibit TNF responses. IL-1-induced IκBα degradation was unaffected by these treatments. Inhibition of TNF signaling could not be prevented with either of the broad spectrum caspase inhibitors zVADfmk or yVADcmk. The inhibition of p38 kinase with SB203580 prevented the inhibition of TNF signaling by all agents except arachidonyl trifluoromethylketone. No changes in the levels or molecular weights of the adaptor proteins TRADD (TNF receptor-associated death domain), RIP (receptor-interacting protein), or TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor-2) were caused by apoptogenic drugs. However, TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) surface expression was significantly reduced by all four agents. Furthermore, TNF-dependent recruitment of TRADD to surface TNFR1 was also inhibited. These data suggest that several putative inhibitors of TNF signaling work by triggering apoptosis and that an early event coincident with the initiation of apoptosis, preceding evidence of injury, is loss of TNFR1. Consistent with this hypothesis, cotreatment of EC with the metalloproteinase inhibitor Tapi (TNF-α proteinase inhibitor) blocked the reduction in surface TNFR1 by apoptogenic drugs and prevented inhibition of TNF-induced IκBα degradation without blocking apoptosis.

Ligand-induced clustering of TNFR1 leads to the recruitment of a cytosolic adaptor protein, called TNF receptor 1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), to the intracellular domain of the receptor (7Hsu H.

IL-1-stimulated activation of NFκB is also dependent on the formation of a ligand-induced receptor complex. The occupied type 1 IL-1 receptor interacts with a transmembrane protein termed IL-1 receptor accessory protein (22Greenfeder S.A. Nunes P. Kwee L. Labow M. Chizzonite R.A. Ju G. J. Biol.

Within the assembled type 1 IL-1 receptor complex, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase becomes autophosphorylated (25Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) and subsequently leaves the complex to associate with cytosolic TRAF6 (26Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). The IL-1 receptor-associated kinase·TRAF6 complex, like the TRADD·RIP·TRAF2 complex, lies upstream of the activation of NFκB-inducing kinase, creating a point of convergence with the TNF signaling pathway. Vascular endothelial cells (EC) are a major target for the pro-inflammatory actions of TNF and IL-1. One of the major proinflammatory responses in EC initiated by the TNF and IL-1 signal transduction cascades described above is the expression of the leukocyte adhesion molecules E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). E-selectin is a surface glycoprotein that mediates the initial tethering and rolling of neutrophils. The cytokine-dependent transcription of this adhesion molecule has an absolute requirement for the activation of NFκB (27Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and can be significantly enhanced by the co-binding of ATF2/c-Jun heterodimers (a form of AP-1) to the E-selectin enhanceosome (28De Luca L.G. Johnson D.R. Whitley M.Z. Collins T. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19193-19196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of the activation of NFκB or AP-1 in response to TNF or IL-1 is therefore a potential target for novel anti-inflammatory reagents. A wide variety of of diverse pharmacological agents including sodium salicylate, arachidonic acid, short chain ceramide (C6-ceramide), and staurosporine (stauro) have been reported to inhibit TNF-mediated activation of NFκB, expression of E-selectin, or both in EC (29Lane T.A. Lamkin G.E. Wancewicz E.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 30Stuhlmeier K.M. Kao J.J. Bach F.H. J. Biol.

However, none of these agents has been shown to interact with any of the molecules identified to date in the TNF signaling pathway. During the course of our investigation of the signaling role of arachidonic acid, we noted that concentrations of this lipid or its structural analogues, such as the cytosolic phospholipase A2inhibitors arachidonyl trifluoromethylketone (ATK) and methylarachidonyl fluorophosphonate, inhibited E-selectin induction but only at concentrations that induced apoptosis. However, these agents were able to block the activation of NFκB before morphological evidence of apoptosis became detectable. These observations led us to hypothesize that coincident with the induction of apoptosis is a common mechanism by which diverse pharmacological compounds can selectively inhibit the EC response to TNF. Here we present evidence in support of this hypothesis and identify the loss of TNFR1 surface expression as the mechanism by which apoptogenic drugs selectively inhibit TNF responses. In accordance with an approved protocol by the Yale University Human Investigations Committee, human umbilical vein EC were isolated and cultured as described previously on gelatin (J. T. Baker Inc.)-coated tissue culture plastic (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) in medium 199 (M199) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 200 μm l-glutamine (all from Life Technologies Inc.), 50 μg/ml EC growth factor (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA), 100 μg/ml porcine heparin (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies Inc.).

Mouse mAb to TNFR1 was a gift from D. Goeddel (Tularik Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Mouse mAb to TNFR2 was purchased from Genzyme Diagnostics (Cambridge, MA). Rabbit anti-human TRAF2 and RIP antibodies were also a gift from D. Goeddel. Mouse mAb to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was a gift from G. Poirier, CHUL Research Center (Quebec, Canada). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for Western blotting were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). For FACS analysis, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H + L) F(ab′)2 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. For experimental manipulation, EC were plated on human plasma fibronectin-coated multiwell chamber slides (Falcon). After treatment, cells were fixed by the addition of an equal volume of paraformaldehyde (1% final) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The slide was subsequently washed twice in PBS, permeabilized for 30 s in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, washed a further four times in PBS, and mounted in Gel Mount (Biomedia Corp., Foster City, CA) containing the nuclear stain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole·HCl (Dapi, ∼0.0001%, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Specimens were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy using a Nikon diaphot microscope with a 360-nm filter. EC plated on gelatin-coated 24- or 96-well plates were treated as described. After experimental manipulation, medium was removed, and cells were washed twice in PBS. The remaining cells were fixed and stained by the addition of 70% ethanol containing 100 μg/ml Hoescht 33258 reagent (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were again washed twice with PBS before fluorescence was recorded (λex = 360 nm, λem = 460 nm) using a fluorescence plate reader (Perspective Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). For analysis of the characteristic cleavage of PARP during apoptosis, EC seeded in six-well plates were treated for 3 h with serum-free M199 containing ATK (0–50 μm) in the presence and absence of zVADfmk (40 μm). Both floating and attached cells were harvested and lysed in TNT solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) containing Pefablock (1 mm), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), NaF (10 mm), Na3VO4 (1 mm), and β-glycerophosphate (1 mm) for 20 min on ice. For all other immunoblots, each well was washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed by the addition of 100 μl of TNT as described above. DNA in cell lysates was sheared by passing the lysates through a 0.5-cc syringe fitted with a 28.5-gauge needle two or three times. For each sample, an equal amount of protein (20 μg) was size-fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore, Milford, MA) and immunoblotted. Detection of the immunogen by enhanced chemiluminesence was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation was performed by the lysis of confluent human umbilical vein EC seeded on three 10-cm dishes (approximately 107 cells/sample) in a total volume of 3 ml of TNT. The lysates were centrifuged at 735 × g for 10 min at 4 °C before being precleared by incubation with 25 μl of a 1:1 slurry of Gamma Bind-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2–3 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 s, the cleared lysates were transferred to another tube and incubated with mAb to TNFR1 (1 μl/sample) overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform before the addition of 50 μl of the 1:1 Gamma Bind-Sepharose slurry to each lysate. Incubation was continued at 4 °C for a further 4–6 h. Immune complexes, collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 3 s, were washed once in ice-cold TNT and three to four times in ice-cold PBS and solubilized by the addition of 25 μl of sample buffer (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The entire sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to quantify the surface amount of TNFR1 and TNFR2 after treatment of EC with ATK, C6-ceramide, sodium salicylate, and stauro. EC were treated as described, harvested by collagenase (Life Technologies Inc.) digestion, and washed in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum before incubation for 30 min at 4 °C with saturating amounts of each antibody or nonbinding control mAb (K16/16) as described previously (34Slowik M.R. De Luca L.G. Fiers W. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1724-1730PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times before the addition of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary Ab and incubation for a further 30 min at 4 °C. Labeled cells were washed an additional three times, fixed in paraformaldehyde (2%), and analyzed by FACS (FACSort, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). EC on gelatin-coated six-well plates were treated for 2 h with serum-free M199 ± ATK (50 μm) or sodium salicylate (20 mm). After incubation the culture medium was harvested, and the amount of soluble TNFR1 in the medium was determined using a soluble TNFR1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Immunotech, Miami, FL). Reports from the literature and our own observations indicate that the cytosolic phospholipase A2inhibitor ATK, the kinase inhibitor stauro, the anti-inflammatory agent sodium salicylate, and the cell-permeant ceramide analogue, C6-ceramide, are all able to inhibit TNF-induced adhesion molecule expression (29Lane T.A. Lamkin G.E. Wancewicz E.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Slowik M.R. De Luca L.G. Min W. Pober J.S. Circ.

This inhibition of E-selectin expression is paralleled by an inhibition of TNF-induced degradation of inhibitory protein IκBα. Optimal inhibitory concentrations, determined in preliminary experiments, are 50 μm ATK, 100 nm stauro, 20 mm sodium salicylate, and 50 μm C6-ceramide. We have found that these concentrations of all of these agents cause EC to undergo apoptosis; suboptimal inhibitory concentrations were less apoptogenic (Fig. 1 and data not shown). This correlation between inhibition of TNF responses and induction of apoptosis may have been missed in prior studies (29Lane T.A. Lamkin G.E. Wancewicz E.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Slowik M.R. De Luca L.G. Min W. Pober J.S. Circ.

More importantly, no evidence of apoptosis was ever detectable in the first 2 h of treatment, by which time inhibition of TNF-mediated activation was already evident. Cytokine-induced E-selectin expression is absolutely dependent on the activation of NFκB (27Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Therefore we examined the effect of 2 h of pretreatment of each apoptosis-inducing reagent on TNF- and IL-1-dependent degradation of IκBα, a critical step in the NFκB pathway. As shown in Fig. 2,A and B, TNF-induced degradation of IκBα is significantly reduced following 2 h of pretreatment with each apoptogenic drug. Surprisingly, no inhibition of IκBα degradation induced by IL-1 is detectable in replicate cultures. The observed effect of apoptogenic agents on TNF-dependent degradation of IκBα is not simply a delay in the kinetics of the degradation of this protein, because a complete time course of TNF treatment from 5 to 60 min revealed that the degradation of IκBα is inhibited at all times examined (data not shown). These observations led us to hypothesize that an early common event in the biochemical program of apoptosis selectively inhibits TNF (but not IL-1) signal transduction. We next examined whether specific effector molecules implicated in the death pathway could inhibit TNF signal transduction. Activation of effector caspases is a common late step in apoptosis (35Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar). To determine whether the activation of caspases participated in the inhibition of TNF-mediated NFκB activation by pretreatment with inducers of apoptosis, we employed the broad spectrum peptide-based caspase inhibitor zVADfmk. This caspase inhibitor (40 μm) was unable to prevent inhibition of TNF-mediated IκBα degradation when administered during pretreatment with ATK (50 μm) over a 2-h period (Fig. 3A) even though it was able to inhibit the characteristic caspase-dependent cleavage of PARP from a 116- to a 85-kDa fragment over a 3-h incubation with ATK (Fig. 3B). Similar results using zVADfmk were obtained with the other three initiators of apoptosis as well as with another broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, yVADcmk (40 μm) (data not shown). We conclude that activation of zVADfmk- and yVADcmk-sensitive caspases do not participate in the inhibition of TNF-mediated NFκB activation. Vilcek and colleagues (36Schwenger P. Bellosta P. Vietor I. Basilico C. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 37Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that the p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 can prevent both sodium salicylate-induced apoptosis and inhibition of TNF signaling in fibroblasts. To determine whether p38 kinase played a role in the inhibition of TNF-dependent activation of NFκB in EC, we employed the same inhibitor. In accord with the fibroblast results, blocking of p38 kinases does relieve the inhibition of TNF-induced IκBα degradation in EC following pretreatment with sodium salicylate (Fig. 4). However, in contrast to the previous study, SB203580 was unable to prevent sodium salicylate-induced apoptosis of EC. SB203580 was similarly effective in preventing the inhibition of TNF-dependent IκBα degradation resulting from pretreatment with C6-ceramide and stauro. Despite a corresponding degree of inhibition of TNF responses by ATK compared with sodium salicylate, SB203580 was ineffective in preventing inhibition of TNF signaling by ATK. Both ATK and sodium salicylate treatment resulted in activation of p38 MAPK measured by Western blotting of the active form of the kinase with a phospho-p38-specific antibody. However, the activation of p38 in response to sodium salicylate was detected after only a 15-min treatment with the reagent and decreased over time, whereas the activation of p38 in respect to ATK was not increased until after 2 h of treatment with the reagent. At this time point the activation of p38 was slightly stronger than the activation initially observed with sodium salicylate. The inability of SB203580 to prevent ATK-dependent inhibition of TNF signaling may therefore result from incomplete blocking of p38 activation. Alternatively, these data may suggest a primary role of p38 kinase for responses to sodium salicylate but a secondary role for responses to ATK. The differential effects of apoptosis inducers on TNF- and IL-1-dependent degradation of IκBα suggest that the point of inhibition caused by the signaling cascade leading to apoptosis must be upstream of the convergence of TNF and IL-1 signal transduction cascades. In EC, TNF signaling begins with ligand binding to TNFR2, which passes the TNF trimer to TNFR1. Previous studies in EC have established that the R32W TNF mutein protein directly and exclusively signals thr"
https://openalex.org/W2053154587,"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is mutated in X-linked agammaglobulinemia patients and plays an essential role in B cell receptor signal transduction. Btk is a member of the Tec family of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases that includes Bmx, Itk, Tec, and Txk. Cell lines deficient for Btk are impaired in phospholipase C-γ2 (PLCγ2)-dependent signaling. Itk and Tec have recently been shown to reconstitute PLCγ2-dependent signaling in Btk-deficient human cells, but it is not known whether the atypical Tec family members, Bmx and Txk, can reconstitute function. Here we reconstitute Btk-deficient DT40 B cells with Bmx and Txk to compare their function with other Tec kinases. We show that in common with Itk and Tec, Bmx reconstituted PLCγ2-dependent responses including calcium mobilization, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and apoptosis. Txk also restored PLCγ2/calcium signaling but, unlike other Tec kinases, functioned in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent manner and failed to reconstitute apoptosis. These results are consistent with a common role for Tec kinases as amplifiers of PLCγ2-dependent signal transduction, but suggest that the pleckstrin homology domain of Tec kinases, absent in Txk, is essential for apoptosis. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is mutated in X-linked agammaglobulinemia patients and plays an essential role in B cell receptor signal transduction. Btk is a member of the Tec family of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases that includes Bmx, Itk, Tec, and Txk. Cell lines deficient for Btk are impaired in phospholipase C-γ2 (PLCγ2)-dependent signaling. Itk and Tec have recently been shown to reconstitute PLCγ2-dependent signaling in Btk-deficient human cells, but it is not known whether the atypical Tec family members, Bmx and Txk, can reconstitute function. Here we reconstitute Btk-deficient DT40 B cells with Bmx and Txk to compare their function with other Tec kinases. We show that in common with Itk and Tec, Bmx reconstituted PLCγ2-dependent responses including calcium mobilization, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and apoptosis. Txk also restored PLCγ2/calcium signaling but, unlike other Tec kinases, functioned in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent manner and failed to reconstitute apoptosis. These results are consistent with a common role for Tec kinases as amplifiers of PLCγ2-dependent signal transduction, but suggest that the pleckstrin homology domain of Tec kinases, absent in Txk, is essential for apoptosis. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) 1The abbreviation used is: Btk, Bruton's tyrosine kinase; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; PH, Pleckstrin homology; SH3, Src-homology 3; BCR, B cell antigen receptor; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PLC, phospholipase C-γ2; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HA, hemagglutinin; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; WT, wild type; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. is a member of the Tec family of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that includes Bmx, Itk, Tec, and Txk (reviewed in Ref. 1Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Sems. Immunol. 1995; 7: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Tec family PTKs are characterized by an NH2-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain followed by a Tec homology domain (containing a Zn2+-binding Btk motif and a proline-rich region), a Src-homology 3 (SH3) and SH2 domain, and a COOH-terminal kinase domain (1Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Sems. Immunol. 1995; 7: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 2Hyvonen M. Saraste M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3396-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Tec PTKs share 50–60% amino acid sequence identity and are predominately expressed by cells of the immune system (1Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Sems. Immunol. 1995; 7: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Bmx and Txk are somewhat atypical family members: Bmx shares little sequence homology with other Tecs within the proline-rich and SH3 domains; Txk is particularly atypical at the NH2 terminus, lacking the PH and Tec homology domains (Fig. 1). Btk, the prototypical Tec family PTK, was first identified in B cells but is also expressed in myelomonocytic and mast cells (1Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Sems. Immunol. 1995; 7: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). An essential role for Btk in signal transduction through the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) was revealed when mutations in Btk were shown to be responsible for a human disease termed X-linked agammaglobulinemia and for X-linked immunodeficiency in the xidmouse (reviewed in Ref. 3Satterthwaite A.B. Li Z. Witte O.N. Sems. Immunol. 1998; 10: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Agammaglobulinemia patients suffer an intrinsic defect in pre-B to B cell development, which results in a lack of mature B cells (4Tsukada S. Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). xidand btk-null mice share a similar, though less severe, phenotype (5Kerner J.D. Appleby M.W. Mohr R.N. Chien S. Rawlings D.J.

Btk was subsequently shown to be activated in B cells by a two-step mechanism involving Lyn and PI 3-kinase. After BCR cross-linking, Lyn activates Btk by transphosphorylation (7Rawlings D.J.

The PI 3-kinase-dependent step involves Btk membrane-targeting by PH domain engagement with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (12Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J.

Btk activity can be down-regulated by the SH2-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP), which dephosphorylates PIP3 (14Bolland S. Pearse R.N. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1998; 8: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 15Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). An effector function for Btk was identified in experiments that used the DT40 chicken B cell system for gene knockouts. Btk-deficient DT40 cells exhibited a reduction in the level of phospholipase C (PLC)-γ2 phosphorylation upon BCR cross-linking and a consequent failure to mobilize calcium and generate inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (16Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In addition, the downstream apoptotic response of DT40 cells after BCR cross-linking was impaired in Btk-deficient cells (17Uckun F.M. Waddick K.G. Mahajan S. Jun X. Takata M. Bolen J. Kurosaki T. Science. 1996; 273: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Analyses of Syk-deficient DT40 cells has shown this PTK also to be crucial in phospholipase-dependent signaling (18Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). A model has been proposed in which the concerted actions of Btk and Syk in phosphorylating PLCγ2 are essential for BCR signal transduction (reviewed in Refs. 3Satterthwaite A.B. Li Z. Witte O.N. Sems. Immunol. 1998; 10: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Desiderio S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin.

The considerable structural homology exhibited among Tec family members suggests that, similar to Src family kinases (22Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar), these proteins may have overlapping functions. A recent report has shown that Itk and Tec can reconstitute Btk responses including BCR-dependent PLCγ2 phosphorylation and calcium mobilization (23Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). This study examined proximal signaling events and did not analyze the capacity of Tec kinases to restore Btk-induced downstream responses including ERK MAPK activation and apoptosis (23Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Moreover, the roles of the atypical Tec family PTKs, Bmx and Txk, have not been examined. Here we reconstitute Btk-deficient DT40 cells with Bmx and Txk, in addition to Itk and Tec. We confirm the role of Tec kinases in phospholipase-dependent signaling (23Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and extend our study to show reconstitution of downstream ERK MAPK activation and apoptotic responses. We find that Bmx can restore Btk signaling, whereas Txk, although capable of restoring PLCγ2 signaling, is unable to reconstitute apoptosis and functions independently of PI 3-kinase. DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% chicken serum (Sigma), penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, and 50 μm mercaptoethanol. DT40 cell lines rendered deficient for btk and plcγ2by homologous recombination were described previously (16Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp.

Bmx, Itk, Tec, and Txk antisera were produced by immunization of rabbits with glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing regions of each kinase spanning from the NH2terminus to the SH3 domain. Antisera against PLCγ2, ERK1, and ERK2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). ERK MAPK assays were as described (26Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY 294002 were from Calbiochem. Immunoprecipitations, immune complex protein kinase assays, and immunoblotting were as described previously (27Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M.

In vitro translation of HA-tagged Tec family PTKs was performed using the TNT™-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). YOP protein-tyrosine phosphatase was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Human Bmx (28Tamagnone L. Lahtinen I. Mustonen T. Virtaneva K. Francis F. Muscatelli F. Alitalo R. Smith C.I. Larsson C.

Blood. 1995; 85: 343-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and human Txk (31Haire R.N. Ohta Y. Lewis J.E. Fu S.M. Kroisel P. Litman G.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) were cloned by a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy using published sequences. The polymerase chain reaction utilized cDNA libraries (prepared by T. McClanahan, DNAX) from lung (Bmx) and from T cells (Itk, Tec, and Txk). The sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cloning of mouse Btk and production of HA-tagged versions of the Tec family PTKs were as described (25Mahajan S. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Kut S.A. Saouaf S.J. Bolen J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5304-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For transfection into DT40 cells, Tec family PTKs were subcloned into the pApuroII vector, and cells were transfected by electroporation (18Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). DT40 cells were labeled with 1 μm indo-1AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at room temperature. After labeling, cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum and 20 mm Hepes buffer. Measurement of calcium flux was performed using a FACSVantage (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). DT40 cells (1 × 105/ml) were incubated with M4 mAb ascites at 2 μg/ml. Flow cytometry analyses of apoptotic cells was carried out after 24 h using the TUNEL in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Human Btk was previously shown to restore BCR-induced PLCγ2 phosphorylation, calcium flux, and apoptosis in Btk-deficient DT40 cells (16Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 17Uckun F.M. Waddick K.G. Mahajan S. Jun X. Takata M. Bolen J. Kurosaki T. Science. 1996; 273: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Here we use mouse Btk to reconstitute Btk-deficient DT40 cells and show that the level of functional reconstitution is dependent on expression levels (Fig. 2). Btk-deficient DT40 cells were transfected with mouse Btk, and three stable clones were selected that expressed different levels of Btk, as measured by Western blotting of whole cell lysates followed by PhosphorImager quantitation (facilitated by the use of 125I-conjugated second Abs) (Fig. 2A). A direct comparison of endogenous chicken Btk in WT DT40 cells and transfected levels of mouse Btk was not possible because of poor cross-reactivity of the mouse Btk antisera with chicken Btk. Similar cell surface expression levels of the BCR on each clone was confirmed by FACS analysis using the M4 anti-chicken μ mAb (data not shown). The three DT40 cell lines that expressed different levels of mouse Btk were compared with WT and Btk-deficient cells for their capacity to flux calcium and undergo apoptosis after BCR cross-linking (Figs. 2,B–C). The initial peak calcium flux and its sustained elevation was relatively poorly reconstituted in clone 2A2, which had the lowest level of Btk. In contrast, clones 1B4 and 1B2, which had greater Btk expression levels, showed reconstitution comparable with WT cells (Fig. 2B). BCR-induced apoptosis was similarly dependent on Btk expression levels. The level of apoptosis increased approximately in proportion to Btk expression (Fig. 2C). These results are consistent with data from Btk-transgenic mice that show Btk to be a limiting component of BCR signaling (32Satterthwaite A.B. Cheroutre H. Khan W.N. Sideras P. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13152-13157Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Taken together, this suggests a role for Btk as a signal amplifier. Btk-deficient DT40 cells were transfected with Bmx, Itk, Tec, or Txk, and stable clones were selected. Expression of each PTK was demonstrated by Western blotting of whole cell lysates with specific antisera (Fig. 3A). Expression of endogenous Bmx, Itk, Tec, or Txk was not detectable in the parental Btk-deficient cells (Fig. 3A). Similar cell surface expression levels of the BCR on each clone was confirmed by FACS analysis (data not shown). Because reconstitution of Btk function is dependent on expression levels (Fig. 2), the relative levels of each Tec family PTK were quantitated using HA-tagged versions as a common reference (Fig. 3,B–D). Tagged kinases were not used in reconstitution experiments because tagging was found to disrupt Btk function (data not shown). To allow relative quantitation, HA-tagged Tec family PTKs werein vitro translated. Translated products were protein-tyrosine phosphatase-treated with YOP to remove potential tyrosine phosphorylation from the HA tag that could affect the epitope. Western blotting was then performed with anti-HA-tag mAb 12CA5 (Fig. 3B). Relative expression levels were quantitated by phosphorimaging analysis. In Fig. 3C, a second set of Western blot analyses were performed, this time with specific Tec family antisera to compare the relative amounts of the quantitated HA-tagged versions from Fig. 3B with whole cell lysates of the transfected clones expressing each Tec family PTK. Quantitation of the data from Fig. 3C with reference to those from Fig. 3B allowed calculation of the relative efficacies of each specific antiserum followed by the relative expression levels of each PTK (Fig. 3D). Btk, Itk, Tec, and Txk were found to be expressed at similar expression levels in the clones tested (within a 4-fold range), but Bmx was expressed relatively strongly by DT40 cells (Fig. 3D). The high level of Bmx expression was a feature of all clones analyzed. In contrast, Txk was generally less well expressed, and clone 3H11 had the greatest level of expression among 15 clones analyzed (data not shown). The data shown in the following sections were generated using the clones shown in Fig. 3 but were representative of at least two clones analyzed in each assay. Btk is transiently activated after BCR engagement, as measured by anti-phosphotyrosine blotting and in vitrokinase activity toward an exogenous substrate (33Saouaf S.J. Mahajan S. Rowley R.B. Kut S.A. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Tsukada S. Witte O.N. Bolen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9524-9528Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Btk activation is a multistep process involving transphosphorylation of Btk by Lyn and subsequent Btk autophosphorylation (7Rawlings D.J. Scharenberg A.M. Park H. Wahl M.I. Lin S. Kato R.M.

A. 1997; 94: 11526-11533Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Experiments using DT40 cells have generated data that is consistent with this mechanism (9Kurosaki T. Kurosaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15595-15598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Here we show that Bmx, in addition to Btk, Itk, and Tec, were rapidly but transiently activated in DT40 cells after BCR cross-linking, as measured by anti-phosphotyrosine blotting (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, some differences in the kinetics of activation of each kinase were apparent after phosphorimaging quantitation of the data (Fig. 4B). In particular, Btk and Tec phosphorylation was more sustained than that for Bmx and Itk. The pattern of whole cell lysate protein phosphorylation in these experiments was not affected by the presence of Btk, Bmx, Itk, or Tec (data not shown). This agrees with earlier data showing that Btk has no detectable affect on whole cell protein tyrosine phosphorylation, for which Lyn and Syk are largely responsible (16Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that Tec kinases may be specific for a relatively narrow range of substrates. Txk, which lacks the PH domain common to the other Tec PTKs, was not inducibly phosphorylated through the BCR and had a relatively high basal level of phosphorylation on tyrosine (Fig. 4, A–B and data not shown). Whole cell protein tyrosine phosphorylation showed a similar pattern to WT DT40 cells (data not shown). These data suggest that Bmx can be activated in a similar manner to Btk, Itk, and Tec but that Txk may be regulated differently. PI 3-kinase activity plays a key role in Btk activation by generating PIP3, the membrane ligand for the Btk PH domain (12Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R.

Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Recently, antigen receptor-induced Itk and Tec activation were shown to be PI 3-kinase-dependent (15Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). To test whether Bmx and Txk are similarly dependent on PI 3-kinase, we analyzed their BCR-induced phosphorylation in the presence of PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In Fig. 4C, cells were stimulated through the BCR for a time period designed to give optimal phosphorylation of each Tec family member in the presence or absence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Activation of individual kinases was measured by anti-phosphotyrosine blotting, and the data was quantified by phosphorimaging analyses (Fig. 4D). The BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Bmx, Btk, Itk, and Tec was reduced in the presence of LY294002, suggesting that the activation of Bmx (in common with Btk, Itk, and Tec) is partially dependent on PI 3-kinase activity. Differences in the extent of inhibition among Tec family members may reflect differences in PH domain affinities for PIP3. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Txk was not reduced in the presence of LY294002. The PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin yielded similar results (data not shown). These data are consistent with a key role for PIP3-PH domain interactions in Tec family activation, but not for Txk, which lacks the PH domain and may be activated by a PI 3-kinase-independent mechanism. Studies using Btk-deficient DT40 cells have identified PLCγ2 as an important substrate for Btk (16Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Moreover, reconstitution of Btk-deficient human cells has shown that Itk and Tec can replace Btk function in regulating PLCγ2 phosphorylation (23Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that Bmx and, surprisingly, Txk, can restore phospholipase-dependent signal transduction in Btk-deficient cells. In Fig. 5A, PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation was measured over a time course after BCR cross-linking. In WT DT40 cells, PLCγ2 was maximally phosphorylated after 1 min and retained tyrosine phosphorylation above resting levels for up to 1 h after stimulation. This pattern of inducible phosphorylation was markedly reduced in the absence of Btk. Expression of all Tec family PTKs, including Txk, restored PLCγ2 phosphorylation to at least WT levels. We previously demonstrated that BCR-induced Btk, Bmx, Itk, and Tec, but not Txk, phosphorylation was dependent on PI 3-kinase (Figs. 4,C–D). Here we have extended these observations by measuring the effect of PI 3-kinase inhibitors on PLCγ2 phosphorylation, which is probably a more accurate measure of Tec PTK activity (Figs. 5,B–C). Cells were stimulated in the presence or absence of wortmannin with anti-BCR mAb for 60 min. This late time point was chosen to reflect Tec PTK activity in sustaining PLCγ2 phosphorylation. Earlier time points reflect a relatively large component of Syk activity in phosphorylating PLCγ2 (e.g.compare WT versus Btk− in Fig. 5A). We found that PLCγ2 phosphorylation was partially inhibited by wortmannin in cells expressing Btk, Bmx, Itk, and Tec but not Txk. Similar results were obtained with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (data not shown). An actual enhancement of PLCγ2 phosphorylation in the presence of wortmannin was observed in Txk-expressing cells in Figs. 5, B–C, but this was not seen consistently. These data suggest that Txk is unique among Tec PTKs in not requiring PI 3-kinase activity for its normal function. In addition to defective PLCγ2 phosphorylation, Btk-deficient cells are impaired in BCR-induced calcium mobilization (16Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 23Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). This function of Btk in calcium signaling could be restored by Itk and Tec (23Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I.

Here we have tested whether Bmx and Txk can reconstitute calcium flux. In Fig. 6, DT40 intracellular calcium flux was measured over an 8-min period, with the addition of anti-BCR mAb after 1 min. WT DT40 cells showed an immediate rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration after BCR engagement, which was sustained above basal levels over the course of the experiment. The initial peak of calcium was reduced in Btk-deficient cells, and no sustained elevation of calcium was observed. Consistent with the PLCγ2 data (Fig. 5A), all Tec family PTKs restored both the initial peak and later sustained phase of the calcium flux to WT levels (Fig. 6). No BCR-induced calcium flux was observed in PLCγ2-deficient DT40 cells, as previously shown (24Takata M. Homma Y. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data demonstrate that all Tec family PTKs can replace Btk in B cells and regulate PLCγ2-dependent calcium mobilization. Activation of the ERK MAPK pathway after BCR cross-linking was recently shown to be impaired in Btk-deficient DT40 cells (34Jiang A. Craxton A. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Moreover, full ERK activation appears to be dependent on protein kinase C, which is itself activated downstream of PLCγ2 (35Hashimoto A. Okada H. Jiang A. Kurosaki M. Greenberg S. Clark E.A. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Here we have tested Tec PTKs for their capacity to reconstitute the ERK MAPK signaling pathway in Btk-deficient DT40 cells (Fig. 7). Cells were stimulated with anti-BCR mAb, and cells were lysed over a 2-h time course. ERK1 and ERK2 MAPK activity was measured by immune complex kinase assay using myelin basic protein as an exogenous substrate (Fig. 7). WT DT40 cells exhibited sustained ERK MAPK activation, whereas in the absence of Btk, ERK activation was transient and delayed.

In fact, neutral free OS are subject to sequential processing (15Cacan R. Dengrement C. Labiau O. Kmiécik D. Mir A.-M. Verbert A. Biochem.

Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3845-3852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to yield a free OS containing five residues of mannose and a single reducingN-acetylglucosamine residue. It has now been demonstrated that this free OS is transferred to lysosomes in order to be degraded (17Saint-Pol A. Bauvy C. Codogno P. Moore S.E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The fate of cytosolic phosphorylated free OS is less clear, but since this oligosaccharide possesses an identical configuration of mannose residues to that of the free OS that undergoes cytosol-to-lysosome translocation, it may be transferred directly into the lysosome. The physiological importance of the capture of cytosolic free OS by the lysosome is indicated by the fact that up to 40% of the free OS recovered from the urine of people with the lysosomal storage disease, α-mannosidosis, have oligosaccharide structures compatible with their having been generated in the cytosol (22Yamashita K. Tachibana Y. Mihara K. Okada S. Yabuuchi H. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5126-5133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Strecker G. Fournet B. Bouquelet S. Montreuil J. Dhondt J.L. Farriaux J.-P. Biochimie. 1976; 58: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, despite the fact that the cytosol-to-lysosome translocation of free OS must represent a vital housekeeping activity in cells engaged in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins, this process remains to be characterized.Although most molecules destined for degradation in the lysosome arrive by way of a series of vesicular fusion steps after their initial capture, either from the extracellular environment into endocytic vesicles (24Smythe E. Lloyd J.B. Mason R.W. Biology of the Lysosome. 27. Plenum Press, New York1996: 51-92Google Scholar) or from within the cell into autophagic vacuoles (25Dunn Jr., W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), it has become apparent that the lysosomal membrane itself may be involved in the capture of cytosolic molecules. For instance, cytosolic proteins containing the KFERQ sequence can be translocated into lysosomes by a lysosomally situated translocation machinery comprising both HSC73 and LGP96 molecules (26Cuervo A.-M. Dice J.F. Science. 1996; 273: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). In addition, lysosomes may contain specific carriers responsible for the import of cysteine (27Pisoni R.L. Acker T.L. Lisowski K.M. Lemons R.M. Theone J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and methotrexate glutamates (28Barrueco J.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11732-11737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from the cytosol. In vivo, the cytosol-to-lysosome transfer of free OS was inhibited by agents that reduce cellular ATP levels and by high swainsonine concentrations, which also inhibited the cytosolic demannosylation of free OS (17Saint-Pol A. Bauvy C. Codogno P. Moore S.E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, apart from being able to rule out macroautophagic sequestration as a possible mechanism to account for this phenomenon, little could be inferred about this process.Here, we demonstrate an ATP-dependent,N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive, saturable import of free OS into isolated rat liver lysosomes. Results are reported to show that the lysosome possesses a novel oligosaccharide importer capable of capturing an array of small polymannose oligosaccharides that possess a reducing GlcNAc residue.DISCUSSIONInitial transport experiments, carried out using permeabilized HepG2 cells (Fig. 2), suggested that lysosomal membranes have the ability to interact with [3H]free OS and led us to test the ability of partially purified rat liver lysosomes to sequester these components. Our lysosome purification procedure led to a 30–40-fold enrichment of β-hexosaminidase activity over that observed in the initial homogenate (results not shown), and in general, greater than 90% of the β-hexosaminidase was found to be sedimentable (see percentage of sedimentable β-hexosaminidase att = 0 in Fig. 3). In addition, we were able to show, as have others (33Ohkuma S. Moriyama Y. Takano T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2758-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), that lysosomes remain acidic during their purification. Thus, the addition of either the proton ionophore, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, or valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, individually to FITC-dextran-loaded lysosomes resulted in modest alkalinizations, whereas the addition of both reagents together induced a rapid and substantial alkalinization of lysosomes (results not shown), indicating that the lysosomal membranes in our lysosome preparation had low permeabilities to both hydrogen and potassium ions and were more acid than the surrounding incubation medium (33Ohkuma S. Moriyama Y. Takano T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2758-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar).Much evidence indicates that not only do free OS associate with the lysosomes in the lysosome-enriched preparation, but they are also transported into functional lysosomes. First, there appeared to be a correlation between association of free OS with the membranes of the lysosomal preparation and the stability of the lysosomes in this preparation (see Fig. 3). Second, we found that association of free OS with the particulate fraction of the lysosomal preparation was greatly enhanced by the addition of low concentrations of SW to the incubation mixtures. As SW had no effect on the stability of free OS not associated with membranes, we were able to conclude that SW is protecting sedimentable free OS from latent mannosidase activities. Since the lysosome is the only known organelle possessing enzymes capable of completely hydrolyzing free OS into their constituent monosaccharides, we conclude that free OS are being transported into the lysosomes of our lysosome-enriched fraction and not into other contaminating organelles.The Lysosomal Free OS Transporter Displays a Unique Specificity That Distinguishes It from the ER-to-cytosol Free OS TransporterOur results show that large polymannose structures (Man9–8GlcNAc2), irrespective of whether they are free or linked to peptide, protein, or lipid, interact poorly with the transporter. On the other hand, less mannosylated free OS (Man5–3GlcNAc) were found to be transport substrates, indicating that the peripheral mannose residues of the larger structures are inhibitory to transport. Inhibition studies with mono- and disaccharides (Fig. 7 and Table I) revealed that the transporter binds predominantly to the GlcNAc-containing reducing terminus of the free OS and that a second sugar linked β-1,4 to the reducing GlcNAc enhances affinity. Furthermore, since linear Man5GlcNAc was better at quenching transport than Manβ1–4GlcNAc and [3H]Man3GlcNAc appeared to be a better transport substrate than [3H]Man5GlcNAc, either or both of the mannosyl residues linked α-1,3 and α-1,6 to the Manβ1–4-GlcNAc core must also add to the binding affinity. To summarize, a possible hypothesis for the interaction of free OS with the lysosomal transporter is that small free oligosaccharides are able to enter a pocket in the transport molecule and, once inside, bind tightly to the transporter via their reducing termini. More fully mannosylated or branched free oligosaccharides, although possessing the same high affinity binding motif, are sterically impeded from entering the pocket and are therefore neither good substrates for transport nor good transport inhibitors. Surprisingly, we noted that the most potent inhibitors of [3H]free OS import into lysosomes were small chitooligosaccharides containing 2–4 residues of GlcNAc, and the parallelism of the dose-response curves shown in Fig. 7Bsuggests that GlcNAc, chitobiose, N-acetyllactosamine, and Manβ1–4-GlcNAc inhibit free OS transport by a common mechanism. These results suggest that the high affinity binding pocket of the lysosomal free OS transporter may be similar to those of many chitin-binding proteins and chitinases that possess a cysteine and glycine-rich structural motif known as the hevein domain (48Beintema J.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Lectins possessing this structural motif such as wheat germ agglutinin (49Allen A.K. Neuberger A. Sharon N. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) and Urtica dioca agglutinin (50Lee R.T. Gabius H.-J. Lee Y.C. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) bind GlcNAc and small chitooligosaccharides in the following order: chitotetraose ≥ chitotriose > chitobiose ≫ GlcNAc. These observations led investigators to propose that the sugar binding sites of such lectins comprise three closely situated subsites (49Allen A.K. Neuberger A. Sharon N. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 50Lee R.T. Gabius H.-J. Lee Y.C. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, our transport inhibition studies (Table I) demonstrate that chitooligosaccharides inhibit [3H]free OS transport with the following order of potency: chitotetraose ≥ chitotriose ≥ chitobiose ≫ GlcNAc, suggesting that the free OS binding pocket of the lysosomal transporter may possess only two high affinity sugar binding sites. It is also noteworthy that both α- and β-N-acetylglucosaminisides bind more efficiently to wheat germ agglutinin than does GlcNAc, whereas our transport inhibition studies show that blocking of the reducing terminus of GlcNAc and di-N-acetylchitobiose with α- and β-benzyl moieties, respectively, greatly reduced their capacities to quench free OS transport (Table I), indicating further differences between the oligosaccharide binding domain of the lysosomal free OS transporter and that of hevein-type lectins. At present, it is not known whether or not the lysosomal free OS transporter can import chitooligosaccharides into lysosomes, but it is noteworthy that similar structures not only exist in invertebrates and fungi but may exist in vertebrates and play a role in their development (51Semino C. Specht C.A. Raimondi A. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4548-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 52Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4523-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The ER-to-cytosol transport of large free polymannose-type OS can be inhibited by mannose (IC50, 4.9 mm) and mannosides (benzyl mannoside, IC50, 0.8 mm) but neither by N-acetylglucosamine (50 mm) nor di-N-acetylchitobiose (10 mm) (8Moore S.E.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), indicating that the ER and lysosomal transporters recognize different structural motifs of free OS. Whereas the interaction of large free polymannose-type oligosaccharides with the ER-to-cytosol transport apparatus has similarities to ER-situatedN-glycan-lectin/enzyme interactions (calcium dependence/inhibition by mannosides; see Ref. 8Moore S.E.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the interaction of free OS with the lysosomal transporter bears similarities to the interactions between free OS and cytosolic glycosidases. Accordingly, the cytosolic chitobiase (15Cacan R. Dengrement C. Labiau O. Kmiécik D. Mir A.-M. Verbert A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) by definition interacts with the reducing di-N-acetylchitobiose moiety of free OS, but more surprisingly, the cytosolic mannosidase has been found to act only on free OS bearing a single GlcNAc residue at their reducing termini (20Oku H. Hase S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 982-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, these two enzymes and the cytosol-to-lysosome free OS transporter interact with free OS in a manner that involves surveillance of the reducing terminus of the oligosaccharide. Perhaps this system has developed to promote an ordered processing of free OS in the cytosol and to ensure that glycoproteins, glycopeptides, and dolichol oligosaccharides do not interfere with the sequestration of free OS by lysosomes.A Novel Transporter Is Responsible for the Import of Free Oligosaccharides into LysosomesHow do the kinetic characteristics of lysosomal free OS transport compare with those of other lysosomal and plasma membrane sugar transporters? Here we observed that lysosomal free OS sequestration was temperature-dependent and displayed aQ 10 of about 2.5 (calculated from the ATP-dependent transport observed after 5-min incubations at 37, 30, and 25 °C; see Fig. 3), which is similar to other lysosomal sugar transport systems (N-acetylhexosamines (38Jonas A.J. Speller R.J. Conrad P.B. Dubinsky W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4953-4956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),Q 10 = 2.3; sialic acid (53Tietze F. Seppala R. Renlund N. Hopwood J.J. Harper G.S. Thomas G.H. Gahl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15316-15322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),Q 10 = 2.4). We were unable to detect saturable free OS transport into lysosomes unless ATP was included in the incubation mixtures; furthermore, we show that free OS transport into lysosomes is critically dependent upon ATP hydrolysis, yet independent of a functional lysosomal proton pump. In contrast, other mammalian lysosomal transporters influenced by ATP such as those described for sialic acid and sulfate show saturability in the absence of ATP and have been shown to be stimulated only about 2-fold by the addition of ATP (39Mancini G.M.S. de Jonge H.R.

The ATP-dependent transport of free OS into lysosomes showed Michaelis-Menten-type saturation kinetics displaying aK uptake of 22.3 μm. This value is significantly lower than the K uptake values obtained for lysosomal hexose (Glc, 75–90 mm; Man, 50–75 mm (42Mancini G.M.S. Beerens C.E.M.T. Verheijen F.W. J. Biol.

Our K uptake value must be considered as an approximation, since 10-min incubations at 30 °C represent the limit of the linearity of the initial transport rate; however, the time chosen was a compromise, since shorter incubation times would have led to very low levels of radioactivity becoming associated with lysosomes. Nevertheless, another cytosolic activity implicated in the clearance of ER-generated free OS from the cytosol, the neutral cytosolic endoglycosidase H-like activity, was recently found to have a K m value of 25 μm for pyridylaminated Man6GlcNAc2 (55Kato T. Hatanaka K. Mega T. Hase S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that free OS import into lysosomes was sensitive to NEM, a thiol-reactive drug that inhibits many ATPases (33Ohkuma S. Moriyama Y. Takano T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2758-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 56Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, free OS import into lysosomes was only weakly inhibited by vanadate, an inhibitor of P-type ATPases (47Fohr K.J. Scott J. Ahnert-Hilger G. Gratzl M. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and not at all by the F0-F1type ATPase inhibitor sodium azide (45Al-Awqati Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 179-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we were unable to demonstrate inhibition of lysosomal free OS import by other well known sugar transporters such as cytochalasin B, phloretin, and phloridzin. Taken together with the unique selectivity of the transport process, these results demonstrate that the sequestration of free OS into lysosomes is accomplished by a novel transporter. The ability of lysosomes to continually clear ER-generated free polymannose-type oligosaccharides from the cytosol indicates that this free OS transporter must be considered an important housekeeping activity of cells engaged in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins.

All these effects of HGF are mediated by the HGF receptor, identified as the product of the c-metproto-oncogene (10Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L. Chan A.M.-L. Kmiecik T.E. Vande Woude G.F.

During embryogenesis, c-met is expressed in epithelial components of various organs, whilehgf is expressed in the adjacent mesenchyme (12Sonnenberg E. Meyer D. Weidner K.M. Birchmeier C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Embryos of mutant mice homozygous for the hgf gene die due to abnormal development of the placenta or both the placenta and liver (13Schmidt C. Bladt F. Goedecke S. Brinkmann V. Zschiesche W. Sharpe M. Gherardi E. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 373: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 14Uehara Y. Minowa O. Mori C. Shiota K. Kuno T. Noda T. Kitamura N. Nature. 1995; 373: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Likewise, c-met-deficient embryos lack muscles of the limbs, diaphragm, and tip of the tongue, all derived from migratory precursors (15Bladt F. Riethmacher D. Isenmann S. Aguzzi A. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 376: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Thus, HGF is now understood as a multifunctional cytokine that mediates epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. In addition to its mitogenic activity, HGF has tumor cytotoxic activity, which suppresses growth of several tumor cell lines including Sarcoma 180 cells, Meth A mouse sarcoma cells, and Hep G2 human hepatoblastoma cells (16Shima N. Itagaki Y. Nagao M. Yasuda H. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Shima N. Nagao M. Ogaki F. Tsuda E. Murakami A. Higashio K.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Moreover, HGF has been shown to inhibit the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vivo and c-myc-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in a transgenic mouse model co-expressing c-myc and hgf (19Shiota G. Rhoads D.B. Wang T.C. Nakamura T. Schmidt E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 20Liu M.-L. Mars W.M. Michalopoulos G.K.

U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9577-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the signaling pathway for the tumor cytotoxic activity of HGF. Recently, we found that HGF activates the apoptosis signaling pathway by increasing the activity of caspase-3, a member of the interleukin 1β-converting enzyme family, without affecting caspase-1 activity or the expressions of the apoptosis suppressors Bcl-2 and Bcl-x in Sarcoma 180 cells (22Arakaki N. Kazi A.J. Kajihara T. Ohnishi T. Daikuhara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We also showed that HGF-suppressed growth was partially restored when the apoptosis signaling pathway was completely inhibited by a caspase-3 inhibitor. This suggested the existence of other pathways, besides that for induction of apoptosis, for the tumor cytotoxic activity of HGF. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2 are produced during many physiological intracellular reactions and in response to external stimuli such as UV radiation. They are, in general, considered to be cytotoxic, but several lines of evidence indicate that regulation of the intracellular redox status is a versatile control mechanism in gene expressions and signal transductions, including those mediating apoptosis (23Dean R.T. Gieseg S. Davies M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is known to induce apoptosis (25Laster S.M. Wood J.G. Gooding L.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2629-2634PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that TNF-α induces intracellular ROS and that free radical scavengers inhibit TNF-α-mediated tumor cell killing (26Meier B.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, many of the chemical and physical stimuli that elicit programmed cell death also generate ROS such as H2O2 and OH− (29Sarafian T.A. Bredesen D.E. Free Radic. Res. 1994; 21: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Low doses of H2O2 induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types, again indicating a role of oxidative stress in regulating cell death (23Dean R.T. Gieseg S. Davies M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar). The involvement of oxidative stress is also suggested in apoptosis induced by p53, transforming growth factor-β, and Fas (30Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar, 31Sánchez A. Álvarez A.M. Benito M. Fabregat I. J. Biol.

Thus, it is likely that oxidative stress is a common signal transducer for diverse cell death-inducing stimuli. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible implication of oxidative stress in the mechanism by which HGF induces tumor cell killing. The present data provide direct evidence that HGF enhances the production of ROS in Sarcoma 180 cells, and suggest that this is a cause of the tumor cytotoxic activity of HGF.

Recombinant human HGF was prepared and purified as described previously (33Yoshiyama Y. Arakaki N. Naka D. Takahashi K. Hirono S. Kondo J. Nakayama H. Gohda E. Kitamura N. Tsubouchi H. Ishii T.

The tumor cytotoxic activity of HGF was determined by an MTT assay (34Buttke T.M. McCubrey J.A. Owen T.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 157: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Sarcoma 180 cells (2 × 105 cells/ml) were plated on Nunc 24-well plastic dishes (Roskilde, Denmark) in 0.4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (basal medium) and cultured as described previously (22Arakaki N. Kazi A.J. Kajihara T. Ohnishi T. Daikuhara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After 24 h, the cells were preincubated with antioxidants for 1 h at 37 °C, then cultured with or without HGF at the indicated concentrations for 48 h. Because NAC itself is a reductant and interferes with the MTT assay, incubated medium with or without NAC was removed after incubation and then 400 μl of basal medium containing MTT (0.5 mg/ml) was added. This procedure almost completely rules out the reducing effect of NAC in the MTT assay. After 30 min, this medium was removed, formazan products were solubilized in 400 μl of acidified isopropyl alcohol (0.04 n HCl in isopropyl alcohol) and the absorbance of the MTT formazan products was measured at 570 nm using a reference wavelength of 650 nm. For Meth A cells, the cells (104 cells/ml) were plated on 24-well plastic dishes in 0.4 ml of RPMI 1640 (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and cultured with or without NAC in the presence or absence of HGF as described above for 96 h. After incubation, the cells were transferred to an Eppendorf tube and precipitated by centrifugation. The cells were washed once with 1 ml of NAC-free medium by centrifugation, and the MTT assay was performed as described above. Cells were cultured as described above except for use of 10 ml of medium/plate in 8.5-cm plastic plates (Nunc). After incubation, the cells were collected and washed, and about 5 × 106 cells were lysed in 200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 4 °C as described previously (22Arakaki N. Kazi A.J. Kajihara T. Ohnishi T. Daikuhara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant containing fragmented DNA was treated with RNase A (100 μg/ml) for 60 min at 37 °C, and then digested with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) for 60 min at 37 °C. Fragmented DNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, washed with 70% ethanol and solubilized in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA. Then 10-μl samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Caspase-3 activity was measured essentially as described by Enari et al. (35Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation of cells in 8.5-cm plastic plates with or without additives as indicated, they were collected, washed as described above, and homogenized in 0.5 ml of extraction buffer (10 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm p-(amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) in a Dounce homogenizer (type A pestle). The cell extracts (80–90 μg of protein) obtained as described above were diluted with 1 ml of reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin), and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 10 μm fluorescent substrate, Ac-DEVD-MCA, in the presence or absence of 10 μm of a specific inhibitor of caspase-3, Ac-DEVD-H. The fluorescence of the cleaved substrate was determined with a spectrofluorometer (Type 850 Hitachi spectrofluorometer, Hitachi, Tokyo) at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and emission wavelength of 460 nm. Caspase-3-like activity was determined by subtracting the values obtained in the presence of inhibitor. One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to the activity that cleaves 1 pmol of the substrate at 30 °C in 1 min/mg of protein. A peroxide-sensitive fluorescent probe DCFH-DA (36Burow S. Valet G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 43: 128-133PubMed Google Scholar) was used to assess levels of net intracellular generation of ROS. Cells treated with HGF for the indicated times were incubated with 5 μm DCFH-DA for 30 min. After incubation, cells were washed once with Mg2+- and Ca2+-free phosphate buffered-saline, detached by trypsinization, collected by centrifugation as described above, and suspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Levels of intracellular ROS were measured with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). In each analysis, 10,000 events were recorded. After preincubation of Sarcome 180 cells (2 × 105/ml) in 8.5-cm plastic plates with or without 5 mm NAC for 1 h, they were incubated with 30 ng/ml HGF for 5 or 10 min. After incubation, they were collected, washed, lysed, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subjected to Western blotting analysis as described previously (22Arakaki N. Kazi A.J. Kajihara T. Ohnishi T. Daikuhara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-mouse c-Met antibodies, and located with an ImmunoStar kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industrials, Osaka), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The scatter activity was assayed according to Stoker et al. (37Stoker M. Gherardi E. Perryman M. Gray J. Nature. 1987; 327: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Briefly, MDCK cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells/ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% fetal calf serum in a 24-well plastic dish (0.4 ml/well), and they were allowed to attach for 24 h. The cells were preincubated with or without NAC (5 mm) for 1 h, and then incubated with or without HGF (30 ng/ml). The cells were further incubated for 24 h. Protein was determined with BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Levels of the reduced form of glutathione were determined in cell extracts by the method of Hissin and Hilf (38Hissin P.J. Hilf R. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (3688) Google Scholar), measuring the fluorescence produced byo-phthalaldehyde as fluorescent reagent at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm and emission wavelength of 420 nm. Student'st test for unpaired samples was used to compare mean values of groups according to Snedecor and Cochran (39Snedecor G.W. Cochran W.G. Statistical Methods. 6th Ed. Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA1967: 1-593Google Scholar). To study the role of oxidative stress on the tumor cytotoxic activity of HGF, we first examined the effect of the glutathione precursor NAC, which is widely used as an intracellular free radical scavenger and has been shown to prevent diverse cell death-inducing stimuli (30Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar, 31Sánchez A. Álvarez A.M. Benito M. Fabregat I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7416-7422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), on HGF-suppressed growth of Sarcoma 180 cells. As described previously (22Arakaki N. Kazi A.J. Kajihara T. Ohnishi T. Daikuhara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), incubation of the cells with HGF (30 ng/ml) for 48 h resulted in reduction of viability to about 50% of that of control cells (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1A, when the cells were incubated with NAC, the HGF-suppressed growth was restored to nearly the control level. NAC was effective at 1 mm and 5 mm NAC restored HGF-suppressed viability to about 85% of that of control cells. NAC itself (over 2 mm) had weak cytotoxic activity on the cells and 5 mm NAC decreased the viability about 16%. These results indicate that NAC completely prevented HGF-suppressed growth of the cells. In addition, we found that NAC did not shift the concentration of HGF required for growth suppression. As shown in Fig. 1B, 100 ng/ml HGF decreased the viability of the cells about 60% and the growth suppression restored to the control level by NAC treatment. The preventive effect of NAC was also confirmed by cell counts. When the cells were incubated with HGF (30 ng/ml) for 48 h, cell numbers decreased to about 65% of that of control cells but the cell numbers again were restored to the control level by NAC (5 mm) treatment. Recently, HGF has been shown to induce apoptosis of Meth A cells (40Gohda E. Okauchi H. Iwao M. Yamamoto I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether NAC blocks HGF-induced growth suppression of Meth A cells as Sarcoma 180 cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, HGF caused reduction in the viability of the cells about 30%, and NAC (5 mm) almost completely restored the HGF-suppressed viability. Other antioxidants and free radical trappers, e.g. GSH, ascorbic acid, superoxide dismutase, catalase, vitamin E, PBN, and TEMPO, are also reported to prevent cell death induced by several cell death-inducing stimuli (30Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar, 31Sánchez A. Álvarez A.M. Benito M. Fabregat I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7416-7422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 41Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the effects of these compounds on HGF-suppressed growth of the cells. As shown in Fig. 2, GSH prevented the effect of HGF in a dose-dependent manner as effectively as NAC. Ascorbic acid partially prevented the effect of HGF, but other compounds at the concentrations tested did not have protective effects. PBN and TEMPO had cytotoxic effects on the cells. When the cells were incubated with 5 mm NAC for 48 h, the intracellular GSH level increased and the mean GSH contents (n = 2) were 5.4, 12.1, and 11.1 μg/mg protein, in cell extracts without NAC, with NAC, and with NAC plus HGF (30 ng/ml), respectively. These results suggest a role of intracellular GSH in the protective effect of NAC against HGF-induced growth suppression. HGF also caused morphological changes of the cells (Fig. 3). Sarcoma 180 cells without HGF had a flattened morphology during culture (Fig. 3A). But when they were incubated with HGF (30 ng/ml) for 48 h, many cells became condensed and rounded with an irregular plasma membrane (Fig. 3B). Detachment of degenerated cells was always observed. These HGF-induced morphological changes were completely inhibited by co-incubation with 5 mm NAC (Fig. 3C), the cells showing a normal morphology, indicating the involvement of oxidative stress in HGF-induced morphological changes. Previously, we found that HGF activates apoptosis in the cells, as assessed by DNA fragmentation and an increase in caspase-3 activity (22Arakaki N. Kazi A.J. Kajihara T. Ohnishi T. Daikuhara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, incubation of the cells with HGF (30 ng/ml) for 48 h resulted in the formation of high molecular weight DNA fragments of about 20 kilobase pairs, as well as oligonucleosomal DNA fragments. HGF also increased caspase-3 activity to about 2.4 times the control value after 48 h incubation (Fig. 4B). Both HGF-induced DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activity were almost completely inhibited by NAC (5 mm), again establishing a role of oxidative stress in regulating HGF-induced apoptosis. The results also indicated that HGF-increased caspase-3 activity may be mediated directly or indirectly by a redox-sensitive pathway, as suggested by others (44Miura M. Friedlander R.M. Yuan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8318-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar,45Troy C.M. Stefanis L. Prochiantz A. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5635-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We next investigated the effect of HGF on the formation of intracellular ROS by flow cytometric analysis using a peroxide-sensitive fluorescent probe DCFH-AD (36Burow S. Valet G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 43: 128-133PubMed Google Scholar). This probe primarily measures hydrogen peroxide and the hydroxy radical. As shown in Fig. 5A, HGF caused an increase in the intracellular ROS level within 7 h incubation and increase in the intracellular ROS level was completely suppressed by co-incubation with 5 mm NAC (Fig. 5B). Increase in ROS was also observed at 24 h (Fig. 5C) and 48 h (data not shown) after HGF treatment. NAC suppressed this increase (Fig. 5D, data not shown for 48 h). Finally, we investigated whether NAC prevents the HGF-induced scattering (motility) of MDCK cells, which is one of well known biological activities of HGF (4Weidner K.M. Arakaki N. Hartmann G. Vandekerckhove J. Weingart S. Rieder H. Fonatsch C. Tsubouchi H. Hishida T. Daikuhara Y. Birchmeier W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As shown in Fig. 6B, HGF treatment induced scattering in MDCK cells after 24 h of incubation. However, NAC did not prevent the HGF-induced scattering (Fig. 6C). NAC itself had no affect the scattering of the cells (Fig. 6D). HGF has diverse biological and physiological functions including mitogenic, motogenic (scatter factor activity), morphogenic, and tumor cytotoxic activities (8Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). To date, however, many studies have been focused on understand the signaling pathways of HGF in mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic activities (46Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z.

https://openalex.org/W1981594612,"Heterodimeric complexes of basic helix-loop-helix/PAS transcription factors are involved in regulation of diverse physiological phenomena such as circadian rhythms, reaction to low oxygen tension, and detoxification. In fibroblasts, the basic helix-loop-helix/PAS heterodimer consisting of the ligand-inducible dioxin receptor and Arnt shows DNA-binding activity, and the receptor and Arnt are able to activate transcription when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain. However, fibroblasts are nonresponsive to dioxin with regard to induction mediated by the DNA response element recognized by the receptor and Arnt. Here we demonstrate that Arnt is associated with a fibroblast-specific factor, forming a complex that is capable of binding the dioxin response element. This factor may function as a repressor since negative regulation of target gene induction appears to be abolished by inhibition of histone deacetylase activity by trichostatin A. Finally, the negative regulatory function of this factor appears to be restricted for dioxin signaling since Arnt was able to mediate, together with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, transcriptional activation in hypoxic cells. Taken together, these data suggest that fibroblast-specific inhibition of dioxin responsiveness involves recruitment by Arnt of a cell type- and signaling pathway-specific corepressor associated with a histone deacetylase.

There is ample evidence for tissue-specific differences in response to environmental contaminants such as halogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD 1The abbreviation used is: TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; XRE, xenobiotic response element; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; HDAC, histone deacetylase; CBP, CREB binding protein; TSA, trichostatin A; TCDF, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DBD, DNA-binding domain.; dioxin) is a prototype compound for this class of compounds (for review, see Ref.1Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). Induction of the dioxin response gene CYP1A1 shows cell-type dependence as demonstrated both in cell culture and in transgenic mice (2Campbell S.J. Carlotti F. Hall P.A. Clark J. Wolf C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2619-2625PubMed Google Scholar). Inducibility of CYP1A1 depends on assembly of two transcription factors, the dioxin receptor and Arnt. Upon ligand (i.e. dioxin) binding to the dioxin receptor, it heterodimerizes with Arnt, and the dimer binds specifically to xenobiotic response elements (XREs) located in promoter regions of target genes such as CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 (3Fujisawa-Sehara A.

Greenlee W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13092-13099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that changes in chromatin structure contribute to ligand-dependent activation ofCYP1A1 transcription (5Morgan J.E. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11622-11626Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Inactive ligand-free dioxin receptor forms a stable heteromeric complex with the 90-kDa heat-shock protein (hsp90) (6Wilhelmsson A. Cuthill S. Denis M. Wikström A.-C. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and is activated by ligand to its DNA-binding state by sequential release of hsp90 and heteromerization with Arnt. Both the dioxin receptor and Arnt belong to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)/PAS family of transcription factors (7Burbach K.M. Poland A. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8185-8189Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 8Ema M. Sogawa K. Watanabe Y. Chujoh Y. Matsushita N. Gotoh O. Funae Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). A structural similarity was found between the dioxin receptor, Arnt, and theDrosophila proteins Sim and Per (7Burbach K.M. Poland A. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8185-8189Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 8Ema M. Sogawa K. Watanabe Y. Chujoh Y. Matsushita N. Gotoh O. Funae Y.

Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). This region of homology was subsequently termed PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim), and both HLH and PAS motifs are required for dimerization of, for example, the dioxin receptor and Arnt proteins (reviewed in Refs. 10Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar and 11Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ligand-binding domain of the dioxin receptor is contained within the PAS region (reviewed in Refs. 10Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar and 11Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Several additional members of the bHLH/PAS family have recently been identified, including mouse Sim1 and Sim2 (12Ema M. Morita M. Ikawa S. Tanaka M. Matsuda Y. Gotoh O. Saijoh Y. Fujii H. Hamada H. Kikuchi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5865-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and Drosophila trachealess (13Isaac D.D. Andrew D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 14Wilk R. Weizman I. Shilo B.-Z. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The locus of the mammalian homologue (Sim2) coincides with the Down's syndrome chromosomal region (15Chen H. Chrast R. Rossier C. Antonarakis S.E. Kudoh J. Yamaki A. Shindoh N. Maeda H. Minoshima S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 9-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) (16Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5100) Google Scholar) is also a bHLH/PAS protein that regulates inducible expression of genes such as erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and a number of glycolytic enzymes in hypoxic cells (reviewed in Ref. 17Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1996; 3: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Under conditions of low oxygen tension, recruitment of Arnt is essential to enable HIF-1α to bind its target DNA sequences (hypoxia response elements). The mechanism of activation of this physiologically important class of transcription factors is not yet understood. It has become increasingly apparent that histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) play important roles in transcriptional regulation. Recent studies suggest that acetylation and deacetylation of histones are involved in the process of chromatin assembly (reviewed in Refs. 18Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar and 19Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Moreover, histone acetyltransferases and HDACs have been found to be components of some transcriptional coactivator and corepressor complexes (for recent reviews, see Refs. 20Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar and 21Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), respectively, which suggests that they modulate transcriptional activity at specific promoters by locally perturbing chromatin structure. Several of these histone acetyltransferase-containing proteins complexes have been identified. For example, CBP/p300, P/CAF, and SRC-1 interact with a variety of DNA-binding transcription factors and have been shown to function as transcriptional coactivators (reviewed in Ref. 21Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Moreover, repression by nuclear receptors has been correlated to binding of corepressors mouse Sin3, NCoR/SMRT, and the HDAC Rpd3/HDAC1 (22Nagy L. Kao H.-Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Mad/Max heterodimer recruits an HDAC via mouse Sin3 and NCoR/SMRT, which seems to repress genes that normally are activated by the Myc/Max heterodimer (23Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 24Hassig C.A. Fleischer T.C. Billin A.N. Schreiber S.L. Ayer D.E. Cell. 1997; 89: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Most studies of mechanisms underlying induction of theCYP1A1 gene encoding cytochrome P4501A1 as well as cytochrome P4501A1 enzymatic activity have been performed using hepatic cells since liver is the tissue that has the highest concentration of P4501A1 (reviewed in Ref. 25Ioannides C. Parke D.V. Drug Metab. Rev. 1990; 22: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Studies of, for example, transgenic mice carrying the CYP1A1 promoter in front of the lacZreporter gene show that inducibility varies in different adult tissues (2Campbell S.J. Carlotti F. Hall P.A. Clark J. Wolf C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2619-2625PubMed Google Scholar), but the mechanism behind this phenomenon is not known. Moreover, consistent with reports on P4501A1 levels in various tissues afterin vivo exposure, we have found normal fibroblasts in culture to be nonresponsive to dioxin with regard to CYP1A1inducibility (26Omiecinski C.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4315-4321PubMed Google Scholar, 27Gradin K. Wilhelmsson A. Poellinger L. Berghard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (and references therein): 4061-4068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of nuclear extracts from fibroblasts show that the dioxin receptor can be activated to its DNA-binding form by ligand (27Gradin K. Wilhelmsson A. Poellinger L. Berghard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (and references therein): 4061-4068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, two constitutively expressed XRE-binding protein species that are not found in responsive cells, i.e. keratinocytes and HepG2 hepatoma cells, are present in fibroblast extracts. We report that this constitutive fibroblast-specific XRE-binding factor(s) is a heteromeric complex, in which one of the factors is Arnt, whereas the other protein(s) that directly contacts the XRE remains to be identified. More important, we also demonstrate that the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (28Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) in combination with dioxin can overcome transcriptional repression in fibroblasts. These results suggest that a cell type-restricted partner factor possibly harboring HDAC activity modulates Arnt function in fibroblasts, resulting in efficient interference with the dioxin receptor signaling pathway. The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was grown in RPMI 1460 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 0.25 μg/ml Fungizone. Fibroblasts were prepared from neonatal foreskin by placing the protease-treated dermis in a cell culture dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented as described above until the fibroblasts had adhered to the plastic and started to divide. Human keratinocytes were isolated from adult donors and cultivated as described previously (29Berghard A. Gradin K. Pongratz I. Whitelaw M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell.

Cultures were treated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), TCDD (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) dissolved in Me2SO, cycloheximide (Sigma), trichostatin A (Sigma), or sodium butyrate (Sigma), whereas control cultures received solvent only, not exceeding a final concentration of 0.1%. pCMV/τDBD, pCMV/τDBD/DR83–805, and pCMV/τDBD/Arnt128–774 have been described previously (30Gradin K.

For the experiments shown in Fig. 3, HepG2 cells were transfected with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were incubated over night in RPMI 1460 medium lacking serum with the indicated plasmid DNA and 1.2 μg of Lipofectin/cm2. The medium was then changed to RPMI 1460 medium supplemented with 10% serum, and the cells were subsequently treated with either 50 nm TCDF or Me2SO alone for 36–48 h prior to harvest. Fibroblasts were transfected by electroporation. Briefly, the cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and plasmid DNA was added to a final volume of 800 μl. The DNA/cell mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature prior to electroporation (13 ohms, 600 microfarads, and 400 V) with an Electro Cell Manipulator (Techtum). After electroporation, cells were put on ice for 10 min before seeding out 100 × 106 cells in 25-cm2 cell culture flasks. Fibroblasts were grown for 48 h prior to treatment with 50 nm TCDF or Me2SO alone for an additional 36–48 h. For the experiments shown in Fig. 7A, both fibroblasts and HepG2 cells were transfected with Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Three microliters of Fugene 6 was combined with the indicated plasmid, and the cells (10 cm2) were incubated with the Fugene 6/DNA mixture for 6 h prior to treatment with 10 nm TCDD and/or TSA for 36–40 h. Luciferin was purchased from BioThema.Figure 7Inducibility of cytochrome P4501A1 is derepressed by treatment with trichostatin A.

Cellular protein was prepared by lysing the cells in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm pepstatin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Bayer), and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Proteins were separated by 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were subsequently stained by ECL Western blotting detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using anti-dioxin receptor or anti-Arnt antiserum at a 1:200 dilution. Preimmune serum did not, under these conditions, give rise to any background reactivity (27Gradin K. Wilhelmsson A. Poellinger L. Berghard A. J. Biol.

A synthetic oligonucleotide spanning the XRE1 element of the rat cytochrome P4501A1 upstream promoter region (3Fujisawa-Sehara A. Sogawa K. Yamane M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4179-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) (5′-gatcCCTCCA GGCTCTTCTCACGCAACTCC GGGGCACg-3′, P4501A1 sequence shown in uppercase letters) was annealed to a complementary 11-nucleotide primer (5′-GTGCCCCGGAG-3′). The primed template was filled in with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I in the presence of 100 μm dCTP, dATP, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine triphosphate, and 3.3 μm[α-32P]dGTP as described (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 5.70Google Scholar). The DNA contains three bromodeoxyuridine residues within the recognition sequence for the receptor as well as a fourth residue near one end of the oligonucleotide (underlined bases). EMSA DNA-binding reactions (contained in an open 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube on ice) were irradiated for 5 min with UV (Stratagene; emission wavelength = 254 nm; intensity = 4000 microwatts/cm2) at a distance of 4–5 cm from the source. The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (9%), dried, and subjected to autoradiography. For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, prestained and 14C-labeled molecular mass marker proteins were purchased from Bio-Rad and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. Cells were treated with 50 nm TCDF for 1 h or 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 4 h before harvest. Nuclei and protein extracted were prepared as described previously (38Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 12.2.1Google Scholar). DNA-binding reactions were assembled in a total volume of 20 μl with 10 μg of nuclear proteins at a final concentration of 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.2 mmEDTA, 75 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin, 5% glycerol, 4% Ficoll, 100 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 12.5 μg/ml poly(dA-dT) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a double-stranded,32P-labeled oligonucleotide as a probe, the sequence of which corresponded to residues −968 to −997 of the humanCYP1A1 gene (5′-CTCCGGTCCT TCTCACGCAA CGCCTGGGCA-3′, sense orientation). In indicated competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was used. A double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-TCTAGTGTTG GAGAACGAAT CAGCATCTGA GTAC-3′) was used as nonspecific competitor DNA, whereas unlabeled probe DNA served as specific competitor. When using anti-dioxin receptor or anti-Arnt antiserum, 10 μg of nuclear protein was preincubated with the diluted antiserum (1:10) for 20 min at room temperature prior to the DNA-binding reaction. Protein-DNA complexes were separated under nondenaturing conditions on a 3% polyacrylamide gel (29:1) run in 50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, and 2.7 mmEDTA at 4 °C. We have previously demonstrated cell type-specific differences in P4501A1 inducibility and shown that normal human fibroblasts are nonresponsive to dioxin with regard to induction of P4501A1 mRNA levels (27Gradin K. Wilhelmsson A. Poellinger L. Berghard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (and references therein): 4061-4068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate if the nonresponsive phenotype of fibroblasts is a more generalized phenomenon, we analyzed regulation in fibroblasts of another dioxin response gene, cytochrome P4501B1 (4Sutter T.R. Tang Y.M. Hayes C.L. Wo Y.Y. Jabs E.W. Li X. Yin H. Cody C.W. Greenlee W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13092-13099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Very low levels of constitutive P4501B1 mRNA expression were observed by RNA blot analysis in untreated fibroblasts, and more important, this message was not induced upon exposure of cells to TCDF (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 2). In control experiments analyzing primary human keratinocytes, P4501B1 mRNA levels were barely detectable by RNA blot analysis, being very similar to the low levels of constitutive P4501B1 mRNA expression observed in primary human fibroblasts. Treatment of keratinocytes with TCDF, however, resulted in significant induction of P4501B1 mRNA expression (Fig. 1, compare lanes 4 and 5). Cycloheximide treatment is known to induce P4501A1 expression in hepatic cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts in the absence of ligand (27Gradin K. Wilhelmsson A. Poellinger L. Berghard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (and references therein): 4061-4068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, also P4501B1 mRNA expression was induced following cycloheximide treatment of fibroblasts (Fig. 1, lane 3). Thus, although TCDF induction response is inhibited, both CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 expression appear to be regulated by a similar, if not identical, cycloheximide-sensitive mechanism, demonstrating that both promoters are not irreversibly repressed in fibroblasts. To examine any differences in expression levels of the dioxin receptor and Arnt between nonresponsive and responsive cells, polyadenylated RNA from fibroblasts and HepG2 cells was analyzed. RNA blot analysis demonstrated that the ∼6-kilobase dioxin receptor mRNA species was expressed at similar levels in both cell types (Fig. 2A). Two Arnt mRNA transcripts of 2.6 and 4.2 kb were present at comparable levels in both fibroblasts and HepG2 cells, respectively (Fig. 2A). In addition, an alternatively spliced Arnt mRNA has been described (9Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.-F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) that contains an extra exon of 45 nucleotides encoding 15 amino acids of unknown relevance. No cell type-specific differences in the presence of this alternatively spliced Arnt mRNA were observed (Fig. 2A). Moreover, immunoblot analysis with antiserum directed against the dioxin receptor or Arnt showed no differences between HepG2 cells and fibroblasts in expression levels of these proteins (Fig. 2B). Thus, these results suggest that nonresponsiveness of fibroblasts to dioxin is not attributable to altered expression levels of the dioxin receptor or its partner factor Arnt. To investigate if the dioxin receptor and Arnt by themselves could function as independent activators in fibroblasts, we used expression plasmids coding for fusion proteins. These constructs contain the N-terminal τDBD fragment (amino acids 1–500) of the human glucocorticoid receptor that spans the major transactivating (τ) and DNA-binding (DBD) domains, but lack the large C-terminal hormone-binding domain (Fig. 3A). This DNA-binding glucocorticoid receptor derivative replaced the dioxin receptor DNA-binding N-terminal bHLH motif (construct pτDBD/DR), generating a dioxin receptor with affinity for glucocorticoid response elements. In addition, Arnt devoid of its N-terminal bHLH domain was fused to the τDBD motif (pτDBD/Arnt) (Fig. 3A). Fibroblasts and HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the chimeric constructs, and activity was assayed as ability to induce glucocorticoid response element-dependent expression of a cotransfected reporter gene (pT109(GRE)2Luc). Upon expression of τDBD/DR in HepG2 cells, a 5-fold induction of reporter gene activity by TCDF was obtained, whereas the activities of τDBD and τDBD/Arnt constructs were not altered by this treatment (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, expression of τDBD/DR produced a 3-fold induction response in fibroblasts (Fig. 3B), and moreover, τDBD/Arnt showed high constitutive activity in the same cells. Taken together, these results indicate that the dioxin receptor and Arnt are functionally active in fibroblasts when analyzed in a transcription-activating context not involving their usual response element. This suggests that repression in fibroblasts is mediated by the XRE sequence element, but not directly through negative regulation of the transactivating domains of the dioxin receptor/Arnt heterodimer.

https://openalex.org/W2138141709,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade has been shown to play an essential role in regulation of cell proliferation and cell differentiation. Although mammalian MAPKs are most abundantly expressed in postmitotic and terminally differentiated neuronal cells, their function in the central nervous system is still largely undefined. We present evidence here for a role of the MAPK cascade in cerebellar long term depression (LTD), which is a widely studied form of synaptic plasticity in mammalian brain. In cultured Purkinje cells, LTD is known to be induced by iontophoretic application of glutamate and depolarization of Purkinje cells. We found that MAPK was activated in Purkinje cells by treatment of primary cultures of rat embryonic cerebella with glutamate and a depolarization-inducing agent, KCl. Application of PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MAPKK/MEK), inhibited both the activation of MAPK and the induction of LTD in Purkinje cells. Furthermore, the induction of LTD was completely blocked by introduction into Purkinje cells of anti-active MAPK antibody, which was found to specifically and potently inhibit the activity of MAPK. These results suggest that postsynaptic activation of the MAPK cascade is essential for the induction of cerebellar LTD."
https://openalex.org/W2148144033,"We examined activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt in the murine B cell line A20. Akt is activated in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase)-dependent manner upon stimulation of the antigen receptor, surface immunoglobulin (sIg). In contrast, Akt induction is reduced upon co-clustering of sIg with the B cell IgG receptor, FcγRIIb. Co-clustering of sIg-FcγRIIb transmits a dominant negative signal and is associated with reduced accumulation of the PtdIns 3-kinase product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns 3,4,5-P3), known to be a potent activator of Akt. PtdIns 3-kinase is activated to the same extent with and without FcγRIIb co-ligation, indicating conditions supporting the generation of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3. We hypothesized that the decreased Akt activity arises from the consumption of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 by the inositol-5-phosphatase Src homology 2-containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP), which has been shown by us to be tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with FcγRIIb when the latter is co-ligated. In direct support of this hypothesis, we report here that Akt induction is greatly reduced in fibroblasts expressing catalytically active but not inactive SHIP. Likewise, the reduction in Akt activity upon sIg-FcγRIIb co-clustering is absent from avian B cells lacking expression of SHIP.

The PtdIns 3-kinase class IA enzymes, which are regulated by tyrosine kinases, appear to be responsible for Akt activation (7Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G.

This class of PtdIns 3-kinase contains two distinct and constitutively associated subunits, an 85-kDa regulatory protein, which contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, and a catalytic 110-kDa subunit.Which PtdIns 3-kinase products are most important for Akt activity is currently a matter of debate. Both phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns 3,4-P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns 3,4,5-P3) bind to the Akt pleckstrin homology domain, but with different affinities, so that PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 binding is considerably more avid (8James S.R.

Besides regulation by 3-phosphoinositides, Akt must also be phosphorylated at conserved serine and threonine residues for maximal activation (reviewed in Ref.13Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). At least one kinase responsible for phosphorylating and activating Akt has been isolated (9Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T.

The activity of this kinase, PtdIns 3,4,5-P3-dependent kinase-1, is greatly increased by PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 and to a lesser extent by PtdIns 3,4-P2. Intriguingly, membrane localization of Akt causes its maximal activation even in resting cells (14Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

Based on these findings, 3-phosphoinositides probably regulate Akt by a dual mechanism, first by bringing Akt into close proximity with the serine/threonine kinase PtdIns 3,4,5-P3-dependent kinase-1 and second by stimulating PtdIns 3,4,5-P3-dependent kinase-1 activity (9Stokoe D.

PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 is possibly a more effective mediator of Akt induction than PtdIns 3,4-P2; however, there is no direct comparison of these two lipids in this regard.Stimulation of B cells by the antigen receptor or surface immunoglobulin (sIg) activates protein tyrosine kinases of the Src and Syk family, which in turn induce several biochemical pathways that cause B cell proliferation and Ig secretion (reviewed in Ref. 17DeFranco A.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 296-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These pathways proceed largely through tyrosine phosphorylation of the conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs within the two proteins Igα and Igβ, which are associated with sIg. Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif phosphorylation promotes recruitment of proteins and enzymes via their SH2 domains.Earlier experiments established that sIg stimulation of B lymphocytes leads to PtdIns 3-kinase association with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (18Gold M.R. Chan V.W. Turck C.W. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2012-2022PubMed Google Scholar) and the accumulation of 3-phosphoinositide products (19Gold M.R. Aebersold R. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 42-50PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 and p110 subunits themselves varies from system to system, but phosphorylation itself does not appear to regulate PtdIns 3-kinase enzymatic activity (20Gold M.R. Duronio V. Saxena S.P. Schrader J.W. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5403-5412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies indicated that the B cell membrane protein CD19 engages the SH2 domains of the p85 adapter subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase (21Hippen K.L. Buhl A.M. D'Ambrosio D. Nakamura K. Persin C.

Presumably, plasma membrane translocation of PtdIns 3-kinase by association of the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit with surface receptors like CD19 promotes production of the 3-phosphoinositides, since membrane targeting of the enzyme in other cells stimulated distal biological effects of PtdIns 3-kinase (23Kulik G.

Co-clustering of sIg and FcγRIIb (negative signaling) probably occurs in vivo in the later stages of the immune response, when antigen is coated with specific IgG (reviewed in Ref.27Coggeshall K.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Such complexes engage both sIg and FcγRIIb on naïve B cells by binding uncoated antigenic epitopes through sIg and the Fc portions of the coating antibodies through FcγRIIb.Recent experiments revealed that B cells exposed to negative signaling conditions do not accumulate PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 and that the induction of Btk, a PtdIns 3,4,5-P3-responsive tyrosine kinase, was reduced (28Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Inhibition of these signaling events may be due either to deficient PtdIns 3-kinase activation or to increased consumption of nascent PtdIns 3,4,5-P3. The former possibility is raised in experiments examining the tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19 and its subsequent engagement of the p85 SH2 domain; results indicated that both events are reduced under negative signaling conditions (21Hippen K.L.

The latter possibility was raised by recent studies indicating that negative signaling conditions promote tyrosine phosphorylation of the polyphosphoinositide 5-phosphatase, SHIP (29Chacko G.W. Tridandapani S. Damen J. Liu L. Krystal G. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2234-2238PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), through SHIP recruitment to tyrosine-phosphorylated FcγRIIb (31Tridandapani S. Kelley T. Pradhan M. Cooney D. Justement L.B. Coggeshall K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SHIP recognizes only 3-phosphoinositides (including PtdIns 3,4,5-P3) and hydrolyzes at the D5-position of the inositol ring (32Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). How these various events regulate SHIP activity is not clear; nevertheless, there is evidence that the catalytic activity of this enzyme is enhanced under conditions of negative signaling in B cells (28Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar).We investigated the induction of Akt under positive and negative signaling in the murine B cell line A20. We found that Akt was rapidly induced under both conditions; however, the level of Akt activity under negative signaling conditions was only half that under positive signaling. The reduced activity was not due to deficient activation of PtdIns 3-kinase itself and was dependent on the presence of the SHIP docking protein FcγRIIb. Furthermore, COS-7 fibroblasts co-transfected with Akt and wild-type SHIP exhibited reduced Akt induction upon serum stimulation, whereas those co-transfected with Akt and catalytically deficient SHIP did not. Last, the avian B cell line DT40 stably transfected with murine FcγRII exhibited a similar decrease in Akt induction upon sIg-FcγRII co-clustering, and this effect was absent in the SHIP (−/−) DT40 derivative, previously described (34Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The evidence provided here suggests a model of Akt regulation whereby both PtdIns 3,4-P2 and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 contribute to Akt activation, PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 being more potent in this regard. SHIP negatively regulates Akt by reducing the available PtdIns 3,4,5-P3.DISCUSSIONThe serine/threonine kinase Akt operates distal to PtdIns 3-kinase in growth factor receptor-stimulated fibroblasts (2Kennedy S.G.

While neither induction of Akt activity nor its relationship to apoptosis has been investigated in a B cell model, studies have indicated that negative signaling conditions promote apoptotic cell death in B cells (51Ashman R.F. Peckham D. Stunz L.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5-11PubMed Google Scholar,52Yamashita Y. Miyake K. Miura Y. Kaneko Y. Yagita H. Suda T. Nagata S. Nomura J. Sakaguchi N. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Results in Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that sIg stimulation induces Akt, and this induction is completely blocked by the PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Since PtdIns 3-kinase is known to be recruited and activated under after sIg triggering (18Gold M.R. Chan V.W. Turck C.W. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2012-2022PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gold M.R. Aebersold R. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 42-50PubMed Google Scholar), Akt activation in this system, like others, is downstream of PtdIns 3-kinase. It is worthwhile noting that the kinetics of Akt activation (Fig. 2) closely parallel the reported formation of PtdIns 3,4-P2 and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 synthesis, which accumulate to high levels in less than 1 min after sIg triggering (19Gold M.R. Aebersold R. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 42-50PubMed Google Scholar, 28Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar).While Akt induction depends on activation of PtdIns 3-kinase and the formation of its 3-phosphoinositide products, it is unclear which 3-phosphoinositide stimulates Akt. Some findings indicate that Akt activity is directly stimulated by the SHIP product, PtdIns 3,4-P2 (12Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar), while others show that Akt activity is indirectly induced by the SHIP substrate, PtdIns 3,4,5-P3, via PtdIns 3,4,5-P3-dependent kinase-1 (9Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 10Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our model of positive and negative signaling in B cells may be ideal to resolve this issue, since the influence of SHIP can be turned on or off by small changes in the stimulating reagent (29Chacko G.W. Tridandapani S. Damen J. Liu L. Krystal G. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2234-2238PubMed Google Scholar) or by known genetic manipulations of the SHIP docking protein FcγRIIb (31Tridandapani S. Kelley T. Pradhan M. Cooney D. Justement L.B. Coggeshall K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that Akt induction in B cells inversely correlates with SHIP induction, in that positive signaling conditions are more efficacious in the stimulation of Akt than negative signaling conditions. Furthermore, we found that the reduction in Akt activation under negative signaling conditions required expression of FcγRIIb, since FcγRIIb-deficient A20 derivative IIA1.6 responds equally upon stimulation with F(ab′)2 or intact anti-Ig reagents (Fig. 5). Last, we specifically tested the effect of SHIP on Akt in transiently co-transfected COS-7 cells. Transfection of Akt with wild-type SHIP inhibited Akt activation, whereas catalytically inactive D672ASHIP did not. These findings directly indicate that SHIP 5-phosphatase activity has a negative effect on Akt induction and suggest that the reduced Akt activity seen after sIg-FcγRIIb co-clustering is due to the recruitment of SHIP to FcγRIIb (described in Refs. 30Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar and 31Tridandapani S. Kelley T. Pradhan M. Cooney D. Justement L.B. Coggeshall K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observations in the wild type and SHIP (−/−) DT40 FcγRII transfectants (Fig. 7) demonstrate that in the absence of SHIP, the inhibition of Akt activation under negative signaling is relieved, confirming that SHIP is indeed responsible for down-regulating Akt activation under negative signaling.Similar results of Akt suppression have been recently reported in studies of the tumor suppressor gene and inositol polyphosphate phosphatase, PTEN (53Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar).The decreased Akt activation under negative signaling does not appear to be due to decreased PtdIns 3-kinase activity, since equivalent amounts of the enzyme are translocated to the membrane and associated with the phosphotyrosine fraction under both signaling conditions. This finding, together with the observation that p85 is present in CD19-depleted lysates (Fig. 3), suggests that PtdIns 3-kinase is translocated to the membrane by other tyrosine-phosphorylated membrane proteins in addition to CD19, such that the reduced association of the enzyme with CD19 under negative signaling (21Hippen K.L. Buhl A.M. D'Ambrosio D. Nakamura K. Persin C. Cambier J.C. Immunity. 1997; 7: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 22Kiener P.A. Lioubin M.N. Rohrschneider L.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3838-3844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) does not significantly affect the amount of PtdIns 3-kinase at the membrane. The equivalent stimulation of PtdIns 3-kinase activity but deficient generation of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 (reported in Ref. 28Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) under negative signaling conditions suggests a role for SHIP-mediated consumption of nascent PtdIns 3,4,5-P3. It has been shown that the induction of Btk, a protein-tyrosine kinase dependent on formation of 3-phosphoinositides (54Li Z. Wahl M.I. Eguinoa A. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13820-13825Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), is blocked by overexpression of SHIP (28Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar).The reduction but not elimination of Akt activity under negative signaling conditions may be due to the reported ability of PtdIns 3,4-P2 to directly activate the enzyme (11Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 12Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Negative signaling conditions would promote a large increase in PtdIns 3,4-P2 through the combined action of PtdIns 3-kinase and SHIP. The PtdIns 3,4-P2 would then cause Akt activation, albeit with less efficiency than PtdIns 3,4,5-P3, which also activates Akt indirectly through PtdIns 3,4,5-P3-dependent kinase-1. An additional possibility is that PtdIns 3,4-P2 promotes inefficient translocation of Akt, since it has less affinity than PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 for the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt (8James S.R. Downes C.P. Gigg R. Grove S.J. Holmes A.B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Thus, reduced Akt membrane translocation would result in reduced Akt activation under negative signaling conditions. We conclude that in the B cell model, both PtdIns 3,4-P2 and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 are capable of Akt activation but that PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 is a more potent inducer and hence SHIP behaves as a negative regulator for Akt induction.These findings in antigen receptor-stimulated B lymphocytes are similar to earlier reports of monocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced FD-fms monocytoid cells (33Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold R. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and of interleukin-3-induced DA-ER cells (55Liu L. Damen J.E. Hughes M.R. Babic I. Jirik F.R. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8983-8988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which undergo accelerated apoptosis upon transfection with wild-type but not catalytic deficient SHIP. Likewise, recent experiments investigating survival or apoptosis in cells stimulated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor revealed SHIP recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation to the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (56Hunter M.G. Avalos B.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4979-4987PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor mutants lacking the fourth cytoplasmic tyrosine failed to recruit and phosphorylate SHIP upon granulocyte colony-stimulating factor stimulation, and the cells displayed a 3-fold increase in cell numbers, compared with those expressing the wild-type receptor. These findings suggest that SHIP recruitment and phosphorylation in response to cytokine stimulation tempers the biological responses to cytokines. There is no molecular or biochemical explanation for the enhanced apoptotic cell death seen in these cases. Based on our findings reported here, we propose that SHIP recruitment and phosphorylation in response to cytokines leads to a reduction in Akt activation, thereby reducing cell survival.Note Added in ProofWhile this manuscript was in review, two groups (Aman Lamkin, T.

https://openalex.org/W1821635550,"The foreign body reaction to implanted biomaterials, characterized by the presence of macrophages and foreign body giant cells (FBGC), can result in structural and functional failure of the implant. Recently, we have shown that interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 can independently induce human macrophage fusion to form FBGC via a macrophage mannose receptor (MR) -mediated pathway. The MR is believed to mediate both endocytosis of glycoproteins and phagocytosis of microorganisms, which bear terminal mannose, fucose, N-acetylglucosamine, or glucose residues. Polarization of microfilaments to closely apposed macrophage membranes as observed with fluorescence confocal microscopy led us to ask whether MR-mediated fusion occurred via a filamentous actin-dependent pathway. Cytochalasins B and D and latrunculin-A, agents that disrupt microfilaments, inhibited macrophage fusion in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentrations of cytochalasins D and B that inhibited fusion did not significantly decrease macrophage adhesion, spreading, or motility but did inhibit internalization of Candida albicans during interleukin-13-enhanced, MR-mediated phagocytosis. Very low concentrations of cytochalasin B (< 2 microM) induced a slight enhancement of macrophage fusion. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that cytokine-induced, MR-mediated macrophage fusion requires an intact F-actin cytoskeleton and that the mechanism of fusion is similar to phagocytosis.--DeFife, K.

https://openalex.org/W1519176300,"Metabolic injury is a complex process affecting various tissues, with intracellular Ca2+ loading recognized as a common precipitating event leading to cell death. We have recently observed that cells overexpressing recombinant ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel subunits may acquire resistance against metabolic stress. To examine whether, under metabolic challenge, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis can be maintained by an activator of channel proteins, we delivered Kir6.2 and SUR2A genes, which encode KATP channel subunits, into a somatic cell line lacking native KATP channels. Hypoxia-reoxygenation was simulated by application and removal of the mitochondrial poison 2,4 dinitrophenol. Under such metabolic stress, Ca2+ loading was induced by Ca2+ influx during hypoxia and release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores during reoxygenation. Delivery of Kir6.2/SUR2A genes, in conjunction with the KATP channel activator pinacidil, prevented intracellular Ca2+ loading irrespective of whether the channel opener was applied throughout the duration of hypoxia-reoxygenation or transiently during the hypoxic or reoxygenation stage. In all stages of injury, the effect of pinacidil was inhibited by the selective antagonist of KATP channel, 5-hydroxydecanoate. The present study provides evidence that combined use of gene delivery and pharmacological targeting of recombinant proteins can handle intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis under hypoxia-reoxygenation irrespective of the stage of the metabolic insult."

The cell density-dependent change in bFGF binding was not the result of altered FGFR expression as determined by equilibrium binding experiments and by immunoblot analysis. However, bFGF-cell surface receptor binding affinities were measured to be 10–20-fold higher at low cell densities than at intermediate and high cell density. bFGF-induced cell proliferation was also cell density-dependent, with maximal stimulation of proliferation 190–280% greater at intermediate densities (15,000 cells/cm2) than at other cell densities. This effect was specific to bFGF as serum, epidermal growth factor, and transforming growth factor-β did not exhibit the same density-dependent profile. Further, heparan sulfate proteoglycans and, specifically, syndecan-4 were implicated as the modulator of bFGF binding and activity. Pretreatment of cell cultures with heparinase resulted in reduced bFGF binding to the cells and abrogated bFGF induced proliferation. These data suggest a mechanism by which cell density regulates heparan sulfate proteoglycan expression and modulates the cellular response to bFGF. Modulation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan expression might be an important aspect of the regulation of stromal cell migration and proliferation during wound healing. The role of cell density in modulating basic fibroblast growth factor binding and activity was investigated. A primary corneal stromal fibroblast cell culture system was used, since these cells do not constitutively express heparan sulfate proteoglycansin vivo except after injury. A 3–5-fold reduction in bFGF binding per cell was observed as cell density increased from 1000 to 35,000 cells/cm2. The cell density-dependent change in bFGF binding was not the result of altered FGFR expression as determined by equilibrium binding experiments and by immunoblot analysis. However, bFGF-cell surface receptor binding affinities were measured to be 10–20-fold higher at low cell densities than at intermediate and high cell density. bFGF-induced cell proliferation was also cell density-dependent, with maximal stimulation of proliferation 190–280% greater at intermediate densities (15,000 cells/cm2) than at other cell densities. This effect was specific to bFGF as serum, epidermal growth factor, and transforming growth factor-β did not exhibit the same density-dependent profile. Further, heparan sulfate proteoglycans and, specifically, syndecan-4 were implicated as the modulator of bFGF binding and activity. Pretreatment of cell cultures with heparinase resulted in reduced bFGF binding to the cells and abrogated bFGF induced proliferation. These data suggest a mechanism by which cell density regulates heparan sulfate proteoglycan expression and modulates the cellular response to bFGF. Modulation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan expression might be an important aspect of the regulation of stromal cell migration and proliferation during wound healing. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) 1The abbreviation used is: bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β. mediates many biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and wound healing (1Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Rifkin D. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 1: 26-45Google Scholar). It is a member of a family of at least 12 heparin-binding proteins. The activity of bFGF is mediated by binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) and to high affinity, cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFR). bFGF can be regulated by HSPG, which serve as low affinity receptors for bFGF (2Moscatelli D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The role of HSPG in modulating bFGF activity has been described at many levels (2Moscatelli D. J. Cell.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13153-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In their role as a co-receptor for bFGF, HSPG participate in a ternary complex with bFGF and FGFRs (9Nugent M. Edelman E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 10McKeehan W. Kan M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 39: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Ornitz D.

Lear J. Nahapetian A. Bradley J. Sisk W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10229-10248Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This complex has high affinity for bFGF, withK d values ranging from 10−10 to 10−12m. The high affinity binding of bFGF has been attributed to a slow dissociation of bFGF from the ternary complex (9Nugent M. Edelman E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 13Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25803-25809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The generation of stable, high affinity bFGF·FGFR complexes is probably a major mechanism leading to HSPG-dependent bFGF activity. In addition, bFGF has been localized to the extracellular matrix, associated with HSPG (6Forsten K. Courant N. Nugent M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Sommer A. Rifkin D. J.

Release of bFGF by matrix degradation may serve as a mechanism for mobilizing bFGF in response to injury or tissue reorganization (16Whitelock J. Murdoch A. Iozzo R. Underwood P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 17Rich C. Nugent M. Stone P. Foster J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Studies using HSPG-deficient cells have demonstrated that bFGF can bind FGFR and induce activity in the absence of HSPG, yet HSPG appear necessary for physiologic, bFGF-induced cellular response (3Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J. Leder P. Ornitz D. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar, 4Rapraeger A. Krufka A. Olwin B.

Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). HSPG do not always lead to potentiation of bFGF. Endothelial cell-derived HSPG have been demonstrated to have an inhibitory effect on smooth muscle cell proliferation, indicating that HSPG are able to sequester bFGF from the cell surface (6Forsten K. Courant N. Nugent M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HSPG have an emerging role in the intracellular processing of bFGF in which HSPG are thought to stabilize bFGF through endosomal and lysosomal trafficking (8Sperinde G. Nugent M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13153-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Since HSPG can influence bFGF binding and activity, much research has focused on the regulation of HSPG as a major control mechanism for bFGF. Studies on differentiating neural cells have demonstrated changes in binding affinity of HSPG for bFGF, attributable to differential HSPG expression (18Brickman Y. Ford M. Gallagher J. Nurcombe V. Bartlett P. Turnbull J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4350-4359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Further, studies in vivo have demonstrated localized HSPG expression at the leading edge of healing corneal wounds (19Brown C. Applebaum E. Banwatt R. Trinkaus-Randall V. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The corneal stroma has a highly defined tissue architecture, where cells make contact via gap junctions between collagen lamellae (20Watsky M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 2568-2576PubMed Google Scholar). The stromal cells do not constitutively express HSPG. This suggests a role for intercellular contact as a regulatory mechanism for differential HSPG expression where cells sense the environment via contact with adjacent cells and matrix components. Hence, intracellular signaling mediated by cell density changes could potentially modulate HSPG expression. Since the cornea is both avascular and devoid of direct lymphatic supply and thus elicits the wound response without significant, direct influence of blood and lymph, it is hypothesized that the corneal stroma is very sensitive to localized changes in intercellular contact and extracellular matrix organization. These changes might signal the cells at the wound edge to express HSPG and provide stromal fibroblasts with a mechanism for bFGF modulation. In the present study, the regulation of bFGF binding to the cell surface of stromal fibroblasts was analyzed and correlated to changes in bFGF-induced proliferation. Cells were cultured at various cell densities to model changes in intercellular contact that would be predicted to be associated with wound healing. Binding of bFGF to the cell surface was measured, and expression of FGFR1 and syndecan 4 was determined. In addition, bFGF-induced cell proliferation was measured at various cell densities. Results from these experiments showed that bFGF-stimulated cell proliferation was cell density-dependent in stromal fibroblasts. Furthermore, bFGF binding was dramatically reduced as cell density increased. These studies suggest that cell-cell contact modulates HSPG expression and thus, controls bFGF binding and activity in corneal stromal fibroblasts. These findings might have implications for wound healing, development, and tissue regeneration.

Collagenase A from Clostridium histolyticum was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Disuccinimidyl suberate was purchased from Pierce. Stromal fibroblasts were isolated from rabbit corneas (Pel-Freez Biologicals, Rogers, AS). Epithelial and endothelial layers were removed (21Trinkaus-Randall V. Capecchi J. Gibbons D. Leibowitz H. Franzblau C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1990; 31: 1321-1326PubMed Google Scholar), and stromas were minced with a razor and digested for 3 h with 2 mg/ml of collagenase A (22Brown C. Nugent M. Lau F. Trinkaus-Randall V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7111-7119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 3 days with 10% FBS in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), low glucose (1% amino acids, 1% penicillin/streptomycin), and maintained in DMEM containing 4% FBS. After cells reached confluence, they were used for experiments. For all experiments, cells were trypsinized and plated at various cell densities in DMEM containing 4% FBS and allowed to adhere for 4 h. Cells were incubated in DMEM containing 10% FBS and cultured for 20–24 h prior to treatment. Preparation of125I-bFGF with 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent was conducted as described by Nugent and Edelman (9Nugent M. Edelman E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding was measured on cultures at 4 °C in binding buffer (DMEM, low glucose, with 25 mm HEPES, 0.05% gelatin) (5Fannon M. Nugent M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17949-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Nugent M. Edelman E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated for 2.5 h at 4 °C with 125I-bFGF and rinsed with ice-cold binding buffer three times. bFGF bound to HSPG was released with rapid washes of a high salt buffer (2 m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Receptor-bound bFGF was released with a 10-min wash with a high salt, low pH buffer (2 m NaCl, 20 mmNaCH3COOH, pH 4.0), followed by a quick rinse with PBS. Bound 125I-bFGF was quantified by counting in an Auto-Gamma 5650 γ-counter (Packard Instruments, Downer's Grove, IL). Nonspecific binding of 125I-bFGF was measured by adding unlabeled bFGF (278 nm) prior to the addition of125I-bFGF. To determine the effects of removing specific glycosaminoglycans on bFGF binding, cells were treated with specific glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes prior to conducting the binding studies. Cells were treated with heparinase I (1.5 μg/ml), chondroitinase ABC (0.1 units/ml), or keratanase/endo-β-galactosidase (0.1 unit/ml). The enzymes and glycosaminoglycan digestion products were removed by washing with binding buffer, and 125I-bFGF binding was measured. To determine the relative expression of FGFR at various cell densities, cells were plated at various cell densities as described and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Cultures were homogenized by scraping in extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and nuclei and insoluble debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 10 min (5Fannon M. Nugent M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17949-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7%) under reducing conditions, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked with PBS (1% Tween 20), 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature, and the antibody to FGFR1 (1:1000) was incubated with the membrane for 1 h at 37 °C. After rinsing three times with PBS (0.1% Tween 20), the membrane was incubated with anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (1.5:5000) secondary antibody and rinsed three times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20. Visualization was conducted by enhanced chemiluminescence using Renaissance reagents from NEN Life Science Products. To further identify FGFR, bFGF·FGFR complexes were covalently cross-linked by disuccinimidyl suberate (5Fannon M. Nugent M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17949-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). FGFR and bFGF were identified by immunoblots. Cells were plated at high density and cultured for 24 h as described. The bFGF binding assay was performed as described above, using unlabeled bFGF. Then cell layers were washed three times with PBS. Fresh PBS (5 ml) was then added to cultures, and disuccinimidyl suberate (300 μm) was added to cross-link bFGF·FGFR complexes. Culture dishes were gently shaken for 20 min at room temperature, and the reaction was quenched by adding 500 μl of buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.0 mglycine). Cells were rinsed three times with PBS and homogenized by scraping in extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclei and insoluble debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7%), proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane, and the membrane was blocked with PBS (1% Tween 20), 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature. For FGFR analysis, immunoblots were performed as described. For bFGF visualization, blots were hybridized with anti-bFGF (1:1000) using the procedure described for FGFR. Mitogen activity was assessed by determining the relative amount of acid phosphatase activity present in each culture after incubation with various mitogens (23Connolly D. Knight M. Harakas N. Wittwer A. Feder J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The level of acid phosphatase has previously been demonstrated to relate directly to cell number in a variety of systems. We performed controls in our studies to ensure that acid phosphatase levels showed a linear relationship with corneal fibroblast cell number under our culture conditions. Cells were plated at several cell densities and incubated for 24 h, as described. Cultures (t = 24) were treated with PBS, bFGF (0.56 nm), TGF-β (0.4 nm), epidermal growth factor (1 nm), or FBS (to a total FBS concentration of 20%) and incubated for 24 h (t = 48). Cell number in replicate cultures was determined by a Coulter counter. One plate was rinsed with PBS and placed at −20 °C to serve as the initial cell density condition for acid phosphatase activity determination at t = 24. At t = 48, cells were rinsed with PBS and placed at −20 °C for 2 h. The amount of cellular acid phosphatase activity was quantified in each culture to determine relative cell numbers. Cells were lysed with buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCH3COO, pH 5.5) and assayed for acid phosphatase activity upon the addition ofpara-nitrophenol phosphate. The role of HSPG in regulating proliferation was determined by treating cultures at cell density of 14,000 cells/cm2 with 1.0 units/ml heparinase III for 1 h prior to the addition of bFGF. Cells were cultured for 24 h at various cell densities as described above. Cells were digested with heparinase III, extracted, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (8.5%). After transfer of proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride, the membrane was blocked with PBS (0.1% Tween 20), 5% nonfat milk overnight and hybridized with anti-syndecan-4 antibody (1:500) for 1 h at 37 °C. The membrane was then washed three times with PBS (0.1% Tween 20) and hybridized with an anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1.5:10,000) for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washes with PBS (0.1% Tween 20), syndecan-4 was visualized as described above. The corneal stroma has a defined architecture of cells, collagen lamellae, and associated proteoglycans. The cells comprising this tissue communicate via gap junctions (20Watsky M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 2568-2576PubMed Google Scholar, 24Spanakis S. Petridou S. Masur S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1320-1328PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role that cell-cell communication plays in modulating the mitogenic response of corneal fibroblasts, growth factor-induced cell proliferation was analyzed in cells at different densities. To determine if responsiveness was dependent on initial plating density or on cell density in general, we examined mitogen-induced cell proliferation in cultures plated at specific cell densities and in cultures plated at a single low density and then grown to various higher densities. To conduct the experiments, cells were cultured at a particular density for 24 h, thereby establishing density-dependent levels of intercellular contact. Then the cultures were treated with epidermal growth factor, TGF-β, bFGF, or serum. From replicate cultures, cell number was determined with a Coulter counter to yield the exact cell density at the time of growth factor inducement. Cell proliferation was assayed by determining relative levels of acid phosphatase activity. Specifically, the percentage of proliferation was determined by measuring acid phosphatase activity at the time of mitogen administration and again after 24 h and comparing the changes to those observed for untreated controls. bFGF stimulated cell proliferation at all cell densities tested (Fig. 1). However, at cell densities between 12,000 and 16,000 cells/cm2, bFGF-stimulated cell proliferation was dramatically increased (190–280%) compared with that observed at other cell densities (40–100%). This effect was experimentally determined five times. Epidermal growth factor stimulated cell proliferation at every density tested, resulting in cell numbers 5–25% higher than untreated controls. In contrast, TGF-β only slightly stimulated cell proliferation (20%) at the highest cell density (30,000 cells/cm2) and had no effect at the other cell densities evaluated. Cultures treated with fetal bovine serum exhibited an increased stimulation of proliferation of 30–60% compared with untreated controls at all densities. For cultures plated at a single low density, grown to various higher densities, and then assayed, the results demonstrated a similar profile to Fig. 1, with bFGF stimulating proliferation at all cell densities and with marked increased stimulation at intermediate cell densities (not shown). Since mitogenic responsiveness to bFGF varied with cell density, it was possible that the expression of cell surface binding sites also varied. Thus, we investigated the role of cell density as a mechanism by which bFGF binding to the cell surface can be modulated. As cells grew from low density (2000 cells/cm2) to high density (19,000 cells/cm2) over 96 h (Fig. 2A), we observed a 3–5-fold decrease in binding of bFGF per cell (Fig. 2B). Cells in low density cultures (500–3000 cells/cm2) bound 0.5–1.4 × 106 molecules of bFGF/cell, whereas cells at higher densities (20,000–35,000 cells/cm2) bound 150,000–250,000 molecules/cell. bFGF binding to cells plated at various cell densities and cultured for 24 h exhibited a similar 3–5-fold increase in bFGF binding per cell at low cell density compared with high cell density (Fig. 2C). Both FGFR and HSPG can independently bind bFGF and, can act together to form a high affinity, ternary complex (7Conrad H. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998Google Scholar, 9Nugent M. Edelman E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 10McKeehan W. Kan M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 39: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We sought to determine the role of each in binding bFGF by measuring the relative amount of bFGF bound to each class of sites. The amount of bFGF bound to these two classes of binding sites can be measured by using selective extraction conditions to remove HSPG-bound bFGF from FGFR-bound bFGF (2Moscatelli D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Binding of bFGF was measured at bFGF concentrations of 27.8 pm to 1.11 nm in cell cultures at densities of 4000, 15,800, and 25,900 cells/cm2. At the highest concentration of bFGF tested (1.11 nm), cells, at densities of 4000, 15,800, and 25,900 cells/cm2, bound a total of 13.3 × 105, 7.19 × 105, and 5.11 × 105 molecules of bFGF/cell, respectively (Fig. 3A). bFGF bound to HSPG sites at the same densities was measured to be 13.0 × 105, 6.70 × 105, and 4.46 × 105molecules/cell, respectively (Fig. 3B).K d values for HSPG interactions were calculated to be 7.8 ± 6.7 and 7.8 ± 7.8 nm for cell densities of 4000 and 15,800 cells/cm2, respectively. The receptor-bFGF interactions were calculated to haveK d values of 23 ± 15, 200 ± 77, and 384 ± 104 pm for cell densities of 4000, 15,800, and 25,900 cells/cm2, respectively. Receptor number/cell was calculated to be (6.9 ± 0.7) × 104, (6.3 ± 0.8) × 104, and (10.0 ± 1.2) × 104molecules/cell. The binding data suggested that the levels of FGFR1 expression did not vary significantly. Further, differences in the K d for bFGF·FGFR1 binding at different cell densities appeared to result from HSPG. To further evaluate the changes in bFGF binding to receptor, immunoblots were performed to compare relative levels of FGFR1 expression at different cell densities using an antibody raised against the extracellular domain of FGFR1. One prominent 73-kDa species was detected, and the expression level did not appear to vary significantly with cell density (Fig. 4A). This band was also detected using a second monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology; data not shown). Although the immunoreactive 73-kDa band does not directly correspond to any described isoforms of FGFR1, FGFR isoforms have previously been shown to be subject to differential expression and processing yielding a range of molecular masses of 55–145 kDa (25Guillonneau X. Regnier-Ricard F. Laplace O. Jonet L. Bryckaert M. Courtois Y. Mascarelli F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2785-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Hanneken A. Maher P. Baird A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Hanneken A. Baird A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1192-1196PubMed Google Scholar, 28Johnson D. Williams L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). To further identify the 73-kDa species as an FGFR, we performed immunoblots for bFGF cross-linked to its receptor and visualized both bFGF and FGFR1 bands by enhanced chemiluminescence. To one half of the membrane, an anti-bFGF monoclonal antibody was hybridized and visualized. This detected a band at 91 kDa, corresponding to the combined molecular masses of bFGF (18 kDa) and the 73-kDa species (Fig. 4B). Also detected were bands at 18 and 36 kDa, corresponding to bFGF and bFGF dimers, respectively. Cross-linked bFGF to FGFR1 was also detected in samples not treated with bFGF, indicating the presence of endogenous bFGF. To the other half of the membrane, an anti-FGFR1 monoclonal antibody was hybridized and visualized. This detected a 73-kDa species and a 91-kDa species only when cells were treated with disuccinimidyl suberate (Fig. 4B). Control blots hybridized only to secondary antibody did not show any bands (not shown). The changes in bFGF binding versus cell density were not mediated by different isoforms of FGFR nor altered levels of FGFR1 expression. From the binding data, HSPG appeared to be the major regulatory mechanism by which these cells modulate bFGF binding. To test this hypothesis, cell cultures at various cell densities were digested with enzymes to degrade specific classes of glycosaminoglycans. Binding was measured and compared with untreated cell cultures. At a cell density of 15,300 cells/cm2, digestion with chondroitinase ABC and keratanase II/endo-β-galactosidase resulted in bFGF binding levels relative to control of 94 and 99%, respectively (Fig. 5). Heparinase I digestion resulted in complete loss of specifically bound bFGF. Similar results were obtained for the cell density of 30,600 cells/cm2. Interestingly, at low cell density (3000 cells/cm2), chondroitinase ABC and keratanase II/endo-β-galactosidase digestion resulted in levels of bFGF binding relative to control of 59 and 80%, respectively. Heparinase I completely abrogated specific binding of bFGF to these low density cultures, as in higher density conditions. To correlate bFGF binding interactions to the density-dependent proliferation profile induced by bFGF (Fig. 1), we treated cultures within the critical density range of 10,000–20,000 cells/cm2 with heparinase III prior to stimulation with bFGF. The percentage of proliferation was determined by measuring the changes in acid phosphatase activity at the time of enzyme digestion to those 24 h later and comparing the changes to those observed for undigested controls. Treatment with bFGF resulted in a 139% stimulation of proliferation. Cultures digested with heparinase III and then treated with bFGF resulted in only 8% stimulation of proliferation. Digestion with heparinase III alone resulted in 22% less proliferation than untreated controls, further indicating the presence of endogenous bFGF (Fig. 6). Differential HSPG expression was predicted to be the regulatory mechanism by which these cells change their binding capacity for bFGF. Since syndecan-4 has been demonstrated to be a major cell surface HSPG (29Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), its expression was measured at different cell densities. Cell extracts were pretreated with heparinase III to release the syndecan-4 core protein and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The results demonstrate a sharp decrease in syndecan-4 expression at higher cell density as indicated by the decrease of the immunoreactive band with an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa (Fig. 7). The results shown are from cell densities of 2, 10, and 25 × 103cells/cm2. The importance of co-receptors, like HSPG for bFGF binding, has been widely studied (2Moscatelli D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 3Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J. Leder P. Ornitz D.

Trans. 1993; 21: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), yielding significant insight into the mechanism and regulation of growth factor activity. Interestingly, many tissues contain high levels of several growth factors yet do not appear to be constitutively responding to their stimuli. For example, the aqueous humor has been reported to contain high concentrations of bFGF, yet the corneal endothelial cells and keratocytes appear quiescent in situ (33Tripathi R. Borisuth N. Tripathi B. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that cellular response might be regulated by the competency of the cells and not solely by the presence of growth factors and their effectors. In this study, we investigated the action of bFGF in primary corneal stromal fibroblast cells cultured at different cell densities. We hypothesized that cell density serves as a mechanism by which cells sense their extracellular environment and control their response to growth factors. We found that bFGF binding was inversely proportional to cell density. Furthermore, we observed that bFGF-stimulated cell proliferation was also density-dependent. Thus, cell density might coordinate extracellular stimuli with cellular context to provide a concerted cellular response. As cell density increased with proliferation, binding of bFGF per cell decreased 3–5-fold. This effect was not simply a result of ligand depletion at high densities, since analysis of the binding data revealed ligand depletion of less than 20%, except at very low concentrations of bFGF (27.8 pm). The binding data further indicated that cells plated at various cell densities and cultured for 24 h, as compared with those proliferating to specific densities, exhibited the same density-dependent changes in bFGF binding. These data indicate that cell density, whether achieved by plating conditions or by culturing to specific densities, provides the cells a mechanism by which bFGF binding may be modulated. Our data emphasize a role for HSPG as the primary means by which these cells modulate bFGF binding. However, it is important to note that the changes we observed might not be a direct response to cell densityper se but instead could reflect the action of additional factors present in our cell culture system. Experiments measuring bFGF·FGFR binding suggested that receptor number did not change with cell density. Indeed, immunoblot analysis showed no density-dependent changes in FGFR1. In contrast, receptor affinity was increased at lower cell densities. Determination of FGFR dissociation constants revealed a 10–20-fold higher affinity at the lowest cell density compared with the highest cell density (23 pm versus 200–384 pm). Thus, receptor affinity appeared to increase with increased expression of HSPG sites, consistent with a cooperative role for HSPG in stabilizing bFGF·FGFR complexes. We also have investigated HSPG core protein expression and identified syndecan-4 as an HSPG species regulated by cell density. Our data indicated a 73-kDa species as a bFGF binding protein in our culture system. This molecular mass does not correspond to any known isoform of FGFR1, although several low molecular mass receptor species have been described (25Guillonneau X. Regnier-Ricard F. Laplace O. Jonet L. Bryckaert M. Courtois Y. Mascarelli F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2785-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Hanneken A. Maher P. Baird A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Hanneken A. Baird A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1192-1196PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the size, we speculate that this protein represents a previously unknown or processed form of FGFR1 or perhaps a proteolytically cleaved ectodomain of FGFR1 liberated by our extraction methods. The epitope of one of the monoclonal antibodies used to detect FGFR was generated using the ectodomain of FGFR1 and that of the other has not been determined. We therefore cannot formally conclude whether this 73-kDa protein is a fragment or a full-length receptor species. We also detected the presence of endogenous bFGF. While not directly measured, evidence that endogenous bFGF exists is 2-fold. First, cells treated for cross-linking in the absence of exogenously added bFGF exhibited a 91-kDa band corresponding to the sum of the 73-kDa FGFR and the 18-kDa bFGF. Second, pretreatment of cell cultures with heparinase I resulted in lower levels of basal cell proliferation compared with untreated controls, indicating a loss of sensitivity to endogenous bFGF-induced proliferation. Changes in cell phenotype resulting from different levels of cell-cell contact have been shown to modulate HSPG expression (18Brickman Y. Ford M. Gallagher J. Nurcombe V. Bartlett P. Turnbull J. J.

Biochem. 1998; 252: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In studies on proliferating smooth muscle cells, HSPG expression was determined to depend on cell phenotype (38Schmidt A. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 52: 229-235PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, HSPG from cells at high density had longer glycosaminoglycan chains than those at lower cell density. HSPG derived from nondividing smooth muscle cell cultures had 10-fold higher antiproliferative potency than HSPG from proliferating cells. Other investigators have measured changes in affinity and binding of bFGF in differentiating neural cells and have determined that the changes described were due to modulation of HSPG expression (18Brickman Y. Ford M. Gallagher J. Nurcombe V. Bartlett P. Turnbull J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4350-4359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Together, these studies strongly correlate cell phenotype with differential HSPG expression. Biochemical analyses of corneal wounds in vivo have demonstrated changes in proteoglycan synthesis, in which heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate expression increase and keratan sulfate decreases (19Brown C. Applebaum E. Banwatt R. Trinkaus-Randall V. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 39Hassell J. Cintron C. Kublin C. Newsome D. Arch. Biochem.

Alternatively, in situ hybridization has been successfully employed to detect HSPG at the leading edge of wounds. In vitro studies of wound healing have largely utilized linear wounds of confluent cell layers. These studies have shown somewhat similar data as in vivo, although they have been limited by the sensitivity of the assays used to describe the biochemistry of the wound healing process. It was our aim to model intercellular communication levels that might be associated with wound healing and development. It has been previously demonstrated that functional gap junctions and focal adhesions form in these cells (20Watsky M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 2568-2576PubMed Google Scholar, 24Spanakis S. Petridou S. Masur S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1320-1328PubMed Google Scholar), indicating a putative sensing mechanism of cell density. Further, in corneal fibroblasts cultured at very low cell density, a phenotypic change has been demonstrated, whereby a population of fibroblasts become myofibroblasts, exhibited by detection of α-smooth muscle actin (41Masur S. Dewal H. Dinh T. Erenburg I. Petridou S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4219-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). This phenotypic change would presumably allow for motility and, eventually, wound contraction. Indeed, changes in motility induced by fibroblast growth factor have been demonstrated in cells at low cell density, while the same growth factor induces mitogenesis at higher cell density (42Rao R. Varani J. Soong H. J. Ocul. Pharmacol. 1992; 8: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this conversion in cellular response was not resolved. Our data show markedly increased bFGF binding in cells at low cell density, potentially indicating a sequestration and protection of bFGF. The implications of this are not yet clear. It is possible that bFGF could induce cell migration until a critical cell density is achieved, whereby the mitogenic effects of bFGF would be dominant and cell proliferation would be stimulated. Thus, the maximal binding observed at low cell density did not correlate to maximal mitogenic potential. Only at intermediate densities were the mitogenic effects of bFGF maximal. Both the mitogenic effects and the binding effects were HSPG-mediated as demonstrated by the abrogation of bFGF-induced proliferation and of bFGF binding after heparinase treatment on the cell cultures. Our data indicate that changes in bFGF binding and activity at different cell densities are HSPG-mediated. HSPG, by serving as low affinity, high capacity binding sites for bFGF, are required for the unique functions of this and possibly other heparin-binding growth factors (7Conrad H. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998Google Scholar). By protecting and sequestering bFGF, HSPG may serve to provide a developing or healing tissue with a constant source of bFGF, with the cellular response being dictated by numerous stimuli. HSPG expression could function to provide spatial and temporal regulation of bFGF and other heparin-binding growth factors to coordinate biological processes.

https://openalex.org/W2036897455,"Stimulation of human platelets with von Willebrand factor (vWF) induced the translocation of the small GTPases Rap1B and Rap2B to the cytoskeleton. This effect was specifically prevented by an anti-glycoprotein Ib monoclonal antibody or by the omission of stirring, but was not affected by the peptide RGDS, which antagonizes binding of adhesive proteins to platelet integrins. Association of Rap2B with the cytoskeleton was very rapid, while translocation of Rap1B occurred in a later phase of platelet activation and was totally inhibited by cytochalasin D. vWF also induced the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins that was prevented by the tyrosine kinases inhibitor genistein and by cAMP-increasing agents. Under these conditions, also the association of Rap1B and Rap2B with the cytoskeleton was prevented. Translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton induced by vWF, but not by thrombin, was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody against the FcγII receptor. The same antibody inhibited vWF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of selected substrates with molecular masses of about 75, 95, and 150 kDa. Three of these substrates were identified as the tyrosine kinase pp72syk, the phospholipase Cγ2, and the inositol 5-phosphatase SHIP. Our results indicate that translocation of Rap1B and Rap2B to the cytoskeleton is regulated by tyrosine kinases and suggest a novel role for the FcγII receptor in the mechanism of platelet activation by vWF.

Our results indicate that translocation of Rap1B and Rap2B to the cytoskeleton is regulated by tyrosine kinases and suggest a novel role for the FcγII receptor in the mechanism of platelet activation by vWF. Rap proteins are low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins that share about 50% sequence homology with the product of theras protooncogene. Human platelets express two members of the Rap family of proteins, Rap1B and Rap2B, which are located at the membrane as a consequence of post-translational modifications, including isoprenylation, proteolysis, and carboxylmethylation (1Torti M. Lapetina E.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The role of Rap1B and Rap2B in platelet function is still poorly understood. Rap1B is phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) 1The abbreviation used is: PKA, protein kinase A; vWF, von Willebrand factor; GP, glycoprotein; FcγRII, FcγII receptor; PGE1, prostaglandin E1; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PLC, phospholipase C; SHIP, SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase.1The abbreviation used is: PKA, protein kinase A; vWF, von Willebrand factor; GP, glycoprotein; FcγRII, FcγII receptor; PGE1, prostaglandin E1; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PLC, phospholipase C; SHIP, SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase.

A. 1989; 86: 3131-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and is rapidly activated upon platelet stimulation with extracellular agonists (3Torti M. Lapetina E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7796-7800Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Franke B. Akkerman J.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). By contrast, Rap2B is not a substrate for PKA (5Ohmstede C.A. Farrell F.X. Reep B.R. Clemetson K.J. Lapetina E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6527-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and its activation upon cell stimulation has not been reported. In thrombin-treated platelets both Rap1B and Rap2B translocate to the cytoskeleton (6Fischer T.H. Gatling M.N. Lacal J.C. White II, G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19405-19408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Torti M. Ramaschi G. Sinigaglia F. Lapetina E.G. Balduini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7553-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This actin-based structure is not only responsible for the morphological changes of activated platelets, but also represents a network connecting several molecules involved in signal transduction processes, including protein-tyrosine kinases, lipid metabolizing enzymes, and membrane glycoproteins (8Fox J.E.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Translocation of Rap2B to the cytoskeleton in thrombin-stimulated platelets requires cell aggregation and is promoted by secondary signals generated by binding of fibrinogen to the membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (GP IIb-IIIa) (9Torti M. Ramaschi G. Sinigaglia F. Lapetina E.G. Balduini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4239-4243Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similarly, fibrinogen binding to GP IIb-IIIa strongly supports Rap1B translocation to the cytoskeleton, although a small amount of this protein associates with the actin-based structures, even in activated cells in the absence of aggregation and ligand binding to GP IIb-IIIa (10Ramaschi G. Sinigaglia F. Torti M. Balduini C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1199: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 11Fischer T.H. Gatling M.N. McCormick F. Duffy C.M. White II, G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17257-17261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The production of secondary signals from GP IIb-IIIa, generated during platelet aggregation and required for the translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton, hampers the possibility to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. In fact, many of the most common agents able to interfere with specific signal transduction pathways, such as inhibitors of protein kinases, Ca2+ chelating and cAMP-increasing agents, prevent the agonist-induced conformational change of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa required for the expression of the fibrinogen binding sites (12Blockmans D. Deckmyn H. Vermylen J. Blood Rev. 1995; 9: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Therefore, their possible effects on Rap proteins translocation to the cytoskeleton in thrombin-stimulated platelets may not be direct, but may be a consequence of the prevention of platelet aggregation. Searching for a more suitable model to investigate the mechanism regulating Rap proteins interaction with the cytoskeleton, we investigated the effect of a different platelet agonist, such as von Willebrand factor (vWF). vWF is a large glycoprotein synthesized by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes and plays an important role in platelet adhesion and thrombus formation (13Meyer D. Girma J.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The main platelet receptor for vWF is the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex (GP Ib-IX-V complex), a member of the leucine-rich glycoprotein gene family (14Clemetson K.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In activated platelets, vWF can also interact with GP IIb-IIIa through a RGD-containing sequence (15Savage B. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11300-11306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of soluble vWF to GP Ib-IX-V complex induces platelet activation associated with arachidonic acid release, Ca2+ mobilization, and protein tyrosine phosphorylation (16Kroll M.H. Harris T.S. Moake J.L. Handin R.I. Schafer A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1568-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 17Ozaki Y. Satoh K. Yatomi Y. Miura S. Fujimura Y. Kume S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1243: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that vWF stimulates the association of pp60src and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with the intracellular cytoskeleton through a mechanism independent of GP IIb-IIIa (18Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Rabinowitz I. Salem H.H. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27093-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in thrombin-stimulated platelets, translocation of pp60src and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the cytoskeleton occurs by a mechanism similar to that of Rap proteins, since this process is regulated by fibrinogen binding to GP IIb-IIIa and aggregation (19Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 20Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Herein we investigated the ability of vWF to induce Rap1B and Rap2B translocation to the cytoskeleton, and we found that this interaction is actually promoted by the interaction of the agonist with the GP Ib-IX-V complex. We also found that vWF-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation is partially mediated by the recruitment of the FcγII receptor (FcγRII) on the cell surface, which is essential to promote Rap proteins translocation to the cytoskeleton.

Human platelets from healthy donors were prepared by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-2B and eluted with HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mmNaHCO3, pH 7.4) as described previously (7Torti M.

Platelet samples (0.4 ml, 109 platelets/ml) were incubated at 37 °C in an aggregometer (Chrono-Log) under constant stirring and then stimulated with 10 μg/ml vWF and 0.5 mg/ml ristocetin or with 0.6 unit/ml thrombin. In some experiments, platelets were preincubated with 10 μm cytochalasin D, 1 mm RGDS, 20 μg/ml IV.3 monoclonal antibody or 20 μg/ml control IgG for 2 min before the addition of the agonists. Preincubation with 10 μm iloprost, 10 μm PGE1, 1 mm acetylsalicylic acid, 10 μm indomethacin, 100 or 200 μm genistein was performed for 30 min. Upon addition of the agonists, aggregation was monitored continuously. Except for the time course experiments, reaction was blocked after 5 min by addition of an equal volume of extraction buffer (HEPES buffer, containing 2% Triton X-100, 10 mm EGTA, 4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm Na3VO4). Lysates were transferred to Eppendorf tubes, vigorously mixed, and placed on ice for 15 min. Triton X-100-insoluble material was recovered by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C.

Samples were boiled 5 min before being analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Samples of gel-filtered platelets (0.25 ml, 109 platelets/ml), treated with buffer or stimulated with 10 μg/ml vWF and 0.5 mg/ml ristocetin for 5 min in the absence or in the presence of 20 μg/ml IV.3 monoclonal antibody, were lysed with an equal volume of immunoprecipitation buffer two times (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm NaF, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). Lysates were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50 mg/ml stock solution).

After brief centrifugation, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer one time and finally resuspended in 25 μl of SDS-sample buffer. Proteins from cytoskeletal samples or total cell lysates, representing equal cell number (1 × 108 and 1 × 107, respectively), as well as immunoprecipitates, were separated on 7.5% linear or 5–15% and 10–20% gradient acrylamide gels according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 6% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered salin (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl) and incubated with the appropriate antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The monoclonal antibody M90, the Rap1B, Rap2B, and the SHIP antisera were used at 1:1,000 dilution, while the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was diluted 1 μg/ml. Antibodies against pp72syk, PLCγ2 and pp125FAK were diluted 1:200. Membranes were extensively washed with 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 20,000, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:20,000 dilution) for 45 min. Upon extensive washing, reactive proteins were visualized with a chemiluminescence reaction. In some experiments, nitrocellulose filters were stripped by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min, blocked again with 6% bovine serum albumin, and reprobed with a different antibody. All the experiments presented are representative of at least three separated experiments. Stimulation of human platelets with 10 μg/ml vWF and 0.5 mg/ml ristocetin induced the incorporation of several proteins into the cytoskeleton, including actin-binding protein (250 kDa), myosin (200 kDa), and α-actinin (99 kDa), as revealed the Coomassie Blue-stained gel shown in Fig. 1A. Cytoskeleton reorganization induced by vWF was very similar to that induced by 0.6 unit/ml thrombin (Fig. 1A). The ability of vWF to promote the translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton was investigated by immunoblotting experiments, using both the monoclonal antibody M90, which recognizes all the members of the Rap family of proteins, and specific antisera against Rap1B and Rap2B. As shown in Fig. 1, B–D, both Rap1B and Rap2B translocated to the cytoskeleton upon stimulation with vWF, and the amount of cytoskeletal-associated Rap1B and Rap2B was comparable with that observed in thrombin-aggregated platelets. The translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton in vWF-stimulated platelets was not affected by the pretreatment of the cells with either acetylsalicylic acid or indomethacin, indicating that this effect was not mediated by the production of thromboxane A2 (data not shown). To analyze the kinetics of vWF-induced translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton, platelets were stimulated in an aggregometer, and at different times the Triton X-100-insoluble materials were analyzed with the antisera against Rap1B and Rap2B. Fig. 2 shows that incorporation of Rap1B into the cytoskeleton was detected after 1 min of stimulation, when aggregation reached about 80%. By contrast, translocation of Rap2B was detectable after 15 s upon addition of the agonist, when only 19% of aggregation was measured. In both cases, incorporation of Rap1B and Rap2B into the cytoskeleton was maximal after 5 min and was paralleled by maximal platelet aggregation. The role of agonist-induced actin polymerization in the translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton was investigated by treating platelets with 10 μm cytochalasin D for 2 min before stimulation with vWF. As reported previously with thrombin-stimulated platelets (23Torti M. Tolnai Festetics E. Bertoni A. Sinigaglia F. Balduini C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we found that cytochalasin D did not affect platelet aggregation induced by vWF (data not shown). Immunoblotting with the specific antisera revealed that treatment of platelets with cytochalasin D completely prevented the association of Rap1B to the cytoskeleton and strongly reduced, but not totally inhibited, the translocation of Rap2B to the Triton X-100-insoluble material (Fig. 3). In thrombin-stimulated platelets, translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton is regulated by fibrinogen binding to GP IIb-IIIa and aggregation (9Torti M. Ramaschi G. Sinigaglia F. Lapetina E.G. Balduini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4239-4243Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Fischer T.H. Gatling M.N. McCormick F. Duffy C.M. White II, G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17257-17261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that platelet aggregation induced by vWF could be prevented by the omission of stirring. Moreover, an antibody against the membrane glycoprotein Ib, AK2, also caused total inhibition of aggregation. By contrast, preincubation of platelets with 1 mm RGDS did not affect platelet aggregation induced by vWF (Fig. 4). The effect of the prevention of vWF interaction with GP Ib-IX-V complex and platelet aggregation on the translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton is reported in Fig. 5A. Preincubation of platelets with the antibody AK2 completely blocked the association of both Rap1B and Rap2B to the Triton X-100-insoluble material. Moreover, when binding of vWF to platelets was allowed, but aggregation was prevented by the omission of stirring, interaction of both Rap proteins with the cytoskeleton was not observed (Fig. 5A). Thus, GP Ib-IX-V complex-mediated aggregation of vWF-stimulated platelets is required for the interaction of Rap1B and Rap2B with the cytoskeleton. To investigate the role played by the receptor occupancy of GP IIb-IIIa, we compared the effect of 1 mm RGDS peptide on thrombin- and vWF-induced translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton. Fig. 5B shows that the ability of vWF to promote the interaction of both Rap1B and Rap2B with the cytoskeleton was not affected by the presence of the RGDS peptide. By contrast, Rap1B and Rap2B did not associate with the cytoskeleton in platelets stimulated with thrombin in the presence of the RGDS peptide.Figure 5Role of GP Ib-IX-V complex, GP IIb-IIIa, and platelet aggregation on vWF-stimulated translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton. A, platelet samples were treated with buffer (Bas), 10 μg/ml vWF and 0.5 mg/ml ristocetin (vWF), or 10 μg/ml vWF and 0.5 mg/ml ristocetin in the presence of 1 μl of the AK2 ascitic fluid (AK2 + vWF) for 5 min under constant stirring. Stimulation with vWF and ristocetin was also performed in the absence of sample stirring (vWF ns). Cytoskeletons were extracted and analyzed by immunoblotting with the antisera against Rap1B and Rap2B, as indicated. B, platelet stimulation with 10 μg/ml vWF and 0.5 mg/ml ristocetin (vWF) or with 0.6 unit/ml thrombin (THR) was performed in the presence or absence of 1 mm RGDS peptide. Immunoblotting analysis of the cytoskeletal proteins was performed with the Rap1B and Rap2B antisera.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated the signal transduction pathways mediating the translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton in vWF-stimulated platelets, and we considered a potential role for the agonist-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed that vWF induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of several platelet substrates, including proteins with a molecular mass of 38, 75, 95, 116, 150, and 230 kDa (Fig. 6). Tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was rapid, being already detectable after 30 s of stimulation, and reached the maximal level after 1 min. To analyze the role of vWF-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation on the translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton, intact platelets were incubated with the tyrosine kinases inhibitor genistein before stimulation with the agonist. Preincubation with both 100 and 200 μm genistein did not inhibit vWF-induced platelet aggregation (data not shown), but efficiently blocked agonist-induced activation of tyrosine kinases, as demonstrated by the total inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 7A). Cytoskeletal samples of platelets stimulated with vWF upon incubation with different concentrations of genistein were analyzed with the antisera against Rap1B and Rap2B. As shown in Fig. 7B, inhibition of tyrosine kinases by genistein completely prevented the translocation of Rap1B to the cytoskeleton. By contrast, genistein, even at 200 μm, caused only a 50% reduction of the association of Rap2B with the cytoskeleton. Similar results were also obtained using different inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, including tyrphostin A47 and erbstatin (data not shown).Figure 7Effect of genistein on protein tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation or Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton. Gel-filtered platelets were incubated with genistein (0, 100, and 200 μm, as indicated) for 30 min at 37 °C and then treated with buffer (Bas) or with 10 μg/ml vWF and 0.5 mg/ml ristocetin (vWF) for 5 min under constant stirring. A, total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, upon proteins separation on a 5–15% acrylamide gradient gel. The position of the molecular mass markers are indicated on the left.B, cytoskeletal proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10–20% acrylamide gradient gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the antisera against Rap1B and Rap2B as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Increased levels of cAMP mediate the inhibition of platelet function (12Blockmans D. Deckmyn H. Vermylen J. Blood Rev. 1995; 9: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The effect of cAMP on vWF-induced translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton was investigated by treating platelets with the prostacyclin analogue iloprost or with PGE1, both of which are able to promote the activation of adenylate cyclase. Fig. 8A shows that pretreatment of platelets with iloprost or PGE1 totally prevented the ability of vWF to induce the translocation of Rap1B to the cytoskeleton and caused a strong, but not total, inhibition of the translocation of Rap2B. To correlate the inhibitory effect of high levels of cAMP with that of the tyrosine kinases inhibitor genistein, the effect of iloprost and PGE1 on protein tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed. Fig. 8B shows that increased cAMP levels completely antagonized vWF-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The physical proximity between the vWF receptor, GP Ib-IX-V complex, and the FcγRII on the platelet surface has been reported recently (24Sullam P.M. Hyun W.C. Szollosi J. Dong J. Foss W.M. Lopez J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5331-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was interesting to know whether the FcγRII was related to the transmembrane signaling leading to Rap proteins interaction with the cytoskeleton. Platelets were treated with the anti-FcγRII monoclonal antibody IV.3, or with control IgG, and then stimulated with either vWF or thrombin. In both cases, we found that the presence of the IV.3 antibody did not affect platelet aggregation (data not shown). Cytoskeletal samples were then analyzed with the Rap1B and Rap2B antisera. Fig. 9 shows that vWF-induced translocation of both Rap1B and Rap2B was strongly inhibited by the preincubation of platelets with the IV.3 antibody, but not with control IgG. Once again, while Rap1B was totally undetectable in the cytoskeleton from IV.3-treated, vWF-stimulated platelets, a reduced amount of Rap2B was still observed in the cytoskeleton from the same samples. Fig. 9 also shows that the ability of thrombin to induce Rap1B and Rap2B translocation to the cytoskeleton was not affected either by control IgG or by the IV.3 antibody. To verify whether the vWF preparation used in this study could activate the FcγRII and lead to Rap proteins translocation to the cytoskeleton through contaminating immunoglobulins, 1 μg of vWF, along with known amounts of purified human IgGs, were analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-IgG antiserum. Fig. 10A shows that the vWF preparation actually contained some contaminating immunoglobulins. However, by densitometric analysis, we calculated that contaminating IgGs represented about 2.4% of the vWF preparation. Thus, platelet samples stimulated with 10 μg/ml vWF were actually incubated with 0.24 μg/ml immunoglobulins. Such a low concentration, and the absence of secondary cross-linking antibodies, argues against a possible direct activation of the FcγRII. However, to completely rule out a possible role of activation of FcγRII by contaminating IgGs in the translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton, 0.5 ml of the vWF preparation was incubated with 10 mg of protein A-Sepharose, and the supernatant was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-human IgG antibodies. As shown in Fig. 10A, this procedure completely removed contaminating IgGs. The IgG-free vWF was as effective as the crude vWF preparation in inducing platelet aggregation (data not shown) as well as the translocation of both Rap1B and Rap2B to the cytoskeleton (Fig. 10B). Therefore, we can exclude that the involvement of FcγRII in the relocation of Rap proteins is the consequence of its recruitment by contaminating IgGs in the vWF preparation. Since our data demonstrated a role for tyrosine kinases in inducing Rap proteins association with the cytoskeleton, the effect of platelet preincubation with the IV.3 antibody on vWF- and thrombin-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation was investigated. Fig. 11 shows that blockade of the FcγRII specifically caused a significant reduction of the number and intensity of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in vWF-stimulated platelets. In particular, the tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates with a molecular mass of about 75, 95, and 150 kDa induced by vWF was prevented by the incubation with the IV.3 antibody, but not with control IgG. Moreover, the ability of thrombin to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the same substrates was not affected either by control IgG or by the IV.3 antibody. To identify some of the proteins whose tyrosine phosphorylation induced by vWF was regulated by recruitment of FcγRII, we immunoprecipitated selected substrates with specific antibodies (Fig. 12). In agreement with a previous report (25Asazuma N. Ozaki Y. Satoh K. Yatomi Y. Handa M. Fujimura Y. Miura S. Kume S. Blood. 1997; 90: 4789-4798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that vWF stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk. In addition, Fig. 12 shows that vWF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk was inhibited by preincubation of platelets with the IV.3 monoclonal antibody. Tyrosine phosphorylation of two different substrates with a molecular mass of 145–150 kDa, the PLCγ2 and the inositol 5-phosphatase SHIP was then investigated. We found that both these substrates were phosphorylated in vWF-stimulated platelets and then this event was inhibited by the blockade of the FcγRII (Fig. 12). Finally, Fig. 12 shows the tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK in vWF-treated platelets. However, in agreement with the evidence that the IV.3 monoclonal antibody did not significantly alter the phosphorylation of any 125-kDa substrate (Fig. 11), we found that tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK was not affected by blockade of FcγRII. Our present data demonstrate that stimulation of human platelets with vWF induced the translocation of the low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins Rap1B and Rap2B to the cytoskeleton. The amount of cytoskeletal-associated Rap1B and Rap2B in vWF-stimulated platelets was comparable with that measured in the cytoskeleton from thrombin-aggregated platelets. However, several differences between the effects of the two agonists were observed. Previous kinetic studies revealed that, in thrombin-stimulated platelets, translocation of Rap1B to the cytoskeleton preceded the translocation of Rap2B, which occurred only in a late phase of platelet aggregation (6Fischer T.H. Gatling M.N. Lacal J.C. White II, G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19405-19408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Torti M. Ramaschi G. Sinigaglia F. Lapetina E.G. Balduini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7553-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Ramaschi G. Sinigaglia F. Torti M. Balduini C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1199: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 11Fischer T.H. Gatling M.N. McCormick F. Duffy C.M. White II, G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17257-17261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the interaction of Rap2B with the cytoskeleton in vWF-stimulated platelets was observed after 15 s, when only about 19% of aggregation was measured. Moreover, translocation of Rap1B occurred later on, when aggregation reached about 80%. It is likely that these kinetics are the expression of different mechanisms regulating the translocation of the two Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton. In this regard, it is interesting to note that pretreament of platelets with cytochalasin D, that prevents agonist-induced actin polymerization, completely inhibited the vWF-induced translocation of Rap1B to the cytoskeleton, but only partially affected the translocation of Rap2B. This indicates that the direct or indirect interaction with the newly polymerized actin filaments totally mediates the incorporation of Rap1B into the cytoskeleton, but it is not sufficient to explain the incorporation of Rap2B. The cytochalasin D-insensitive interaction of Rap2B with the cytoskeleton may indicate either the binding of the protein to preformed actin filaments or the interaction with other structures, such as microtubules. Our present information show that vWF-induced translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton required platelet aggregation triggered by the interaction of vWF with the GP Ib-IX-V complex. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, interaction of Rap proteins with the cytoskeleton is dependent on GP IIb-IIIa-mediated aggregation (9Torti M. Ramaschi G. Sinigaglia F. Lapetina E.G. Balduini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4239-4243Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Fischer T.H. Gatling M.N. McCormick F. Duffy C.M. White II, G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17257-17261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, vWF-induced translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton is not regulated by occupancy of the fibrinogen receptor, since no inhibitory effects of the RGDS peptide were observed. In this regard, Rap proteins behave much like pp60src and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, whose translocation to the cytoskeleton in vWF-stimulated platelets is independent of GP IIb-IIIa (18Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Rabinowitz I. Salem H.H. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27093-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also found that the antibody AK2, which prevents binding of vWF to the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V, and the omission of sample stirring, prevented vWF-induced translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton. This indicates that platelet aggregation mediated by interaction of vWF with the GP Ib-IX-V complex is sufficient to trigger this process. The evidence that, in vWF-stimulated platelets, interaction of Rap proteins with the cytoskeleton was independent of fibrinogen binding to GP IIb-IIIa allowed further investigations on the signal transduction pathways mediating these events. We successfully used an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases to demonstrate that protein tyrosine phosphorylation is associated to the translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton in vWF-stimulated platelets. vWF induced the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates. By immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies we identified the tyrosine kinases pp72syk and pp125FAK and the lipid-metabolizing enzymes PLCγ2 and SHIP as four substrates that are tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation of human platelets with vWF. Tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of pp72syk induced by vWF has been demonstrated recently (25Asazuma N. Ozaki Y. Satoh K. Yatomi Y. Handa M. Fujimura Y. Miura S. Kume S. Blood. 1997; 90: 4789-4798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, our data provide the first evidence for a possible involvement of pp125FAK, PLCγ2, and SHIP in the mechanism of platelet activation by this agonist. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by vWF was completely blocked by genistein, which also totally prevented the interaction of Rap1B with the cytoskeleton and reduced the amount of cytoskeletal-associated Rap2B without affecting platelet aggregation. Once again, we noticed that translocation of Rap1B and Rap2B to the cytoskeleton was differently sensitive to the inhibition of tyrosine kinases. This supports the hypothesis of the existence of two different mechanisms regulating Rap2B interaction with the cytoskeleton. The analysis of the effect of increased amount of cAMP levels strengthens this conclusion. In fact, both iloprost and PGE1 totally prevented the association of Rap1B, but only partially that of Rap2B. The inhibitory effect of cAMP on the translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton is unlikely to be related to the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Rap1B, since previous works have demonstrated that both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated form of the protein can interact with the actin filaments (11Fischer T.H. Gatling M.N. McCormick F. Duffy C.M. White II, G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17257-17261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed a partial inhibition of the association of Rap2B to the cytoskeleton, even if this protein is not a substrate for PKA (5Ohmstede C.A. Farrell F.X. Reep B.R. Clemetson K.J. Lapetina E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6527-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we have found that increased levels of cAMP prevented vWF-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Therefore, we propose that the inhibition of Rap proteins translocation to the cytoskeleton by incresed levels of cAMP is the consequence of its inhibitory effects on the activation of tyrosine kinases induced by vWF. Significantly, the different sensitivity of the translocation of Rap1B and Rap2B to the cytoskeleton to cAMP-increasing agents is similar to the effect of genistein. The mechanism of cAMP-mediated inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by vWF is still unclear, but the cross-talk between the two types of kinases shown herein is most interesting. The evidence that iloprost and PGE1 totally blocked this effect suggests that cAMP interfers with a very early event in the signal transduction pathway initiated by vWF. In this regard, it is interesting to note that one of the best characterized substrate for the cAMP-dependent kinase is the β-chain of glycoprotein Ib, an essential component of the vWF receptor on the platelet surface (26Fox J.E.B. Reynolds C.C. Johnson M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12627-12631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although protein tyrosine phosphorylation in vWF-stimulated platelets has been reported previously, the mechanism coupling GP Ib-IX-V complex occupancy to the activation of tyrosine kinases has not been identified. Recently evidence was advanced for the association of the 14-3-3 signaling protein with the intracellular domain of glycoprotein Ib and its translocation to the cytoskeleton upon stimulation with vWF (27Andrews R.K. Harris S.J. McNally T. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 28Calverley D.C. Kavanagh T.J. Roth G.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 1295-1303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now provide evidence that signaling initiated by binding of vWF to GP Ib-IX-V complex is partially mediated by the FcγRII. Blockade of the FcγRII by the monoclonal antibody IV.3 selectively prevented tyrosine phosphorylation of specific substrates in vWF-stimulated, but not in thrombin-stimulated, platelets. A previous work reported the physical proximity of GP Ib-IX-V complex with the FcγRII (24Sullam P.M. Hyun W.C. Szollosi J. Dong J. Foss W.M. Lopez J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5331-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here it is demonstrated for the first time that FcγRII participates in platelet activation induced by vWF. In this respect the mechanism of action of vWF resembles that of collagen. In this case it has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of some proteins, including the tyrosine kinase pp72syk, is promoted by binding of collagen to glycoprotein VI and is mediated by the association with the Fc receptor γ chain (29Tsuji M. Emuzi Y. Arai M. Takayama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23528-23531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Moreover, a direct involvement of the FcγRII in collagen-induced platelet activation was suggested by Keely and Parise (30Keely P.J. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26668-26676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that both collagen and vWF are multimeric adhesive proteins expressing different binding sites for specific receptors and are able to promote the formation of glycoproteins clusters upon binding to the platelet surface. The inhibition of vWF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation by blockade of the FcγRII appeared to be limited to a selected number of substrates, which include pp72syk, PLCγ2, and SHIP, but not pp125FAK. The exact mechanisms by which FcγRII participate in vWF-initiated signaling, as well as the possibility that FcγRII itself becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated, deserves further investigations. Interestingly, we found that blockade of the FcγRII by the IV.3 antibody totally inhibited the association of Rap1B to the cytoskeleton. In light of similar inhibitory effect observed in genistein-treated platelets, our results suggest that translocation of Rap1B to the cytoskeleton is mediated by signaling through tyrosine phosphorylation induced by vWF in a FcγRII-dependent mechanism. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the partial inhibition of the translocation of Rap2B to the cytoskeleton in genistein-treated platelets closely correlates with that observed in platelets incubated with the IV.3 antibody. We have demonstrated that binding of vWF to the GP Ib-IX-V complex induced the translocation of both Rap1B and Rap2B to the platelet cytoskeleton through a GP IIb-IIIa-independent mechanism. The evidence shows a novel role of FcγRII in regulating both protein tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation of Rap proteins to the cytoskeleton. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of platelet activation by vWF."
https://openalex.org/W1824295282,"To define the mechanism of nitric oxide (NO) action in the glomerulus, we attempted to identify genes that are regulated by NO in rat glomerular mesangial cells. We identified a Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) that was strongly induced in these cells by treatment with S-nitroso-glutathione as a NO-donating agent. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) acutely decreased Cu/Zn SOD mRNA levels. The LPS-mediated decrease in Cu/Zn SOD is reversed by endogenously produced NO, as LPS also induced a delayed strong iNOS expression in these cells in vitro, which is accompanied by increased Cu/Zn SOD expression. NO dependency of Cu/Zn SOD mRNA recovery could be demonstrated by inhibition of this process by L-NG-monomethylarginine, an inhibitor of NOS enzymatic activity. To demonstrate the in vivo relevance of our observations, we have chosen LPS-treated rats as a model for induction of a systemic inflammatory response. In these animals, we demonstrate a direct coupling of Cu/Zn SOD expression levels to the presence of NO, as Cu/Zn SOD mRNA levels declined during acute inflammation in the presence of a selective inhibitor of iNOS. We propose that the up-regulation of Cu/Zn SOD by endogenous NO may serve as an adaptive, protective mechanism to prevent the formation of toxic quantities of peroxynitrite in conditions associated with iNOS induction during endotoxic shock."
https://openalex.org/W2117623002,"The B cell lymphoma WEHI-231 has been used as a model to study immature B cell tolerance, based on its capacity to undergo growth arrest and programmed cell death on B cell receptor (BCR) cross-linking. Using this model to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes, we found that BCR cross-linking results in the selective activation of caspase 7/Mch3, but not of the other two members of the CPP32 family, caspase 2/Nedd2 and caspase 3/CPP32. This was evidenced by the induction of proteolytic activity against the substrate for the CPP32 subfamily of caspases (z-DVED-AMC) in vitro, as well as PARP proteolysis in vivo and by the processing of the 35 kDa Mch3 into a 32 kDa species, which was later further proteolyzed. The general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, but not the CPP32 family inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO, blocked anti- micro-induced apoptosis, indicating that a caspase not belonging to the CPP32-like family is also implicated in anti- micro-triggered apoptosis. In contrast, z-VAD-fmk was not able to counteract growth arrest induced by anti- micro treatment, suggesting that caspase activation is not necessary for induction of growth arrest. Neither of the inhibitors prevented Mch3 processing; however, z-VAD-fmk prevented proteolysis of the p32 subunit, suggesting that further processing of this subunit is associated with apoptosis. Bcl-2 overexpression prevented anti- micro induction of CPP32-like activity and apoptosis, and blocked further processing of the Mch3 p32 subunit. In contrast, CD40 stimulation completely blocked the appearance of the p32 subunit in addition to blocking CPP32-like activity and apoptosis induced by BCR cross-linking. Moreover, only CD40 stimulation was able to prevent anti- micro-induced growth arrest, which was correlated with inhibition of retinoblastoma and of cyclin A down-regulation. In splenic B cells, Mch3 is also specifically proteolyzed ex vivo after induction of apoptosis by BCR cross-linking, demonstrating the specific involvement of caspase-7/Mch3 in apoptosis induced in B cell tolerance."

These mutations abolished vitamin D-dependent transactivation. In addition, VDR mediates a ligand-dependent repression of the response of the retinoic acid receptor β2 promoter to retinoic acid, and the helix 3 and helix 12 mutants were unable to mediate transrepression. Furthermore, the VDR mutants, but not the native receptor, enhanced phorbol ester induction of the activator protein-1-containing collagenase promoter. The helix 3 and helix 12 mutations strikingly reduced the ability of VDR to interact with the coactivators steroid receptor coactivator-1, ACTR, and the CREB-binding protein. As a consequence, overexpression of steroid receptor coactivator-1 increased vitamin D-dependent transactivation by VDR but not by the K246A mutant. These results indicate that the lysine 246 participates, together with residues in helix 12, in the recruitment of coactivators and that AF-2 activity is involved both in ligand-dependent transactivation and in transrepression by VDR.

As a consequence, overexpression of steroid receptor coactivator-1 increased vitamin D-dependent transactivation by VDR but not by the K246A mutant. These results indicate that the lysine 246 participates, together with residues in helix 12, in the recruitment of coactivators and that AF-2 activity is involved both in ligand-dependent transactivation and in transrepression by VDR.

Transcriptional actions of nuclear receptors can result not only from direct modulation of target gene expression but also from cross-talk with other nuclear receptors and signal transduction pathways (e.g. AP-1 activity) (8Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar).Nuclear receptors display a modular structure with an N-terminal region A/B, followed by region C (the DNA-binding domain), a hinge region D, and the C-terminal E/F region containing the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and the dimerization domain (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

An autonomous ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function (AF-2) is located in the LBD (9Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin.

(1997) EMBO Workshop on Structure and Functions of Nuclear Receptors, May 2–5, 1997, Erice, Italy (abstr.) publisher, city, country.Google Scholar). Although some variability exists, the ligand-binding domains contain a similar helical fold with twelve α-helices (numbered helix 1 to helix 12) (21Wurtz J.M. Bourghet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The most striking difference between unoccupied (apo) and ligand-bound (holo-) receptors is the position of the C-terminal helix 12, which contains the core AF-2 domain. This helix projects away from the LBD in the apo-receptors but is tightly packed against helix 3 of the LBD upon ligand binding. In addition, the LBDs of the holo-receptors are more compact that those of the unliganded receptors, indicating that the ligands may reconfigure other surface features of the LBD. The conformational change in helix 12, together with other changes that occur after ligand binding such as the bending of helix 3, are believed to create a surface that allows binding of coactivator proteins required to transduce the signal to the basal transcriptional apparatus (9Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Three related family members, including SRC-1/NCoA1, TIF-2/GRIP-1, and ACTR/pCIP, that interact with the nuclear receptors in a ligand- and AF-2-dependent manner and act as as bona fide coactivators have been identified (22Oñate S.A.

In addition, ligand-dependent transcription by different nuclear receptors appears to require CBP/p300, which also exerts a coactivator role for other transcription factors and interacts directly with the nuclear receptors and the coactivators (28Kamei Y.

A. 1996; 93: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that binding of coactivators such as SRC-1 or ACTR to the liganded receptors recruits at least two other nuclear factors, CBP and p/CAF creating a multisubunit activation complex (26Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 27Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A.

Several of these proteins have histone acetylase activity, which can disrupt nucleosomes (26Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Therefore, the current model for transcriptional regulation by nuclear receptors suggests that the AF-2 of nuclear receptors serves to recruit a multicomponent coactivator complex that can open up chromatin (33Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 34Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar).By analyzing the transcriptional activity of mutant receptors, it has been confirmed that residues located not only in helix 12 but also in helix 3 are required for ligand-dependent transcriptional activity. In particular, mutation of a highly conserved lysine residue at the C terminus of helix 3 strongly impairs transactivation by estrogen receptor (35Henttu P.M.A. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), thyroid hormone receptor (36O′Donnell A.L. Koenig R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 4: 715-720Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 37Helmer E.B. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 38Palomino T. Barettino D. Aranda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and VDR (39Whitfield G.R. Hsieh J.-C. Nakajima S. MacDonald P.N. Thompson P.D. Jurutka P.W. Haussler C.A. Haussler M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1166-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutation, which could disrupt interaction between helices helix 12 and helix 3, has been very recently shown to reduce binding of the coactivators SRC-1 and TIF-2 to estrogen receptor (35Henttu P.M.A. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In this study we have analyzed the role of mutations in the conserved VDR residues Leu417 and Glu420 (in helix 12) and Lys246 (in helix 3) on transcriptional responses to vitamin D. Our data confirm that these residues are required for ligand-dependent activation and exert a dominant negative effect on the response of a VDRE-containing promoter to the native receptor. Furthermore, the native receptor is able to suppress retinoic acid-dependent transactivation of the RARβ2 promoter in a vitamin D-dependent manner, and mutation of these residues also abolishes this inhibitory effect. In addition, the VDR mutants increased the activity of the AP-1 containing collagenase promoter in the presence or phorbol esters or c-Jun, whereas the wild type VDR did not affect this response. Mutation of the Glu420, Leu417, and Lys246 residues strongly reduced the ligand-induced binding of the coactivators SRC-1, ACTR, and CBP. These data indicate that both the residues in helix 12 and the conserved lysine residue of the predicted helix 3 of VDR participate in the recruitment of coactivators and, therefore, in AF-2 activity.DISCUSSIONPrevious work has shown the importance of the C-terminal helix 12 for AF-2 activity of nuclear receptors. Helix 12 contains residues with significant negative charges and forms an amphipathic α-helix that functions as an interaction surface for coactivators (17Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 18Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). In this study we confirmed the requirement of an intact AF-2 core domain for vitamin D-activated transcription. Point mutants E420Q and L417S were transcriptionally silent, although they have been described to bind vitamin D with equilibrium constants similar to wild type VDR (14Masuyama H. Brownfield C.M. St. Arnaud R. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These amino acids in helix 12 are required for the interaction with SRC-1, SUG-1, or RIP140 in the yeast two-hybrid system (14Masuyama H. Brownfield C.M. St. Arnaud R. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and ourin vitro interaction assays indicate that in the presence of vitamin D the coactivators ACTR (the human homologue of mouse p/CIP) and CBP also fail to associate in a ligand-dependent manner with VDRs containing these inactivating mutations in helix 12. This defect can explain the lack of transcriptional activation.Although the minimal AF-2 domain of VDR (residues 408–427) appears to be sufficient to mediate ligand-dependent transactivation as well as interaction with coactivators, the activity of this region is only partial (14Masuyama H. Brownfield C.M. St. Arnaud R. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This suggested that additional elements of the LBD outside the core AF-2 domain were important for generating an efficient AF-2. These elements could include helix 3 because this helix is in close proximity to helix 12 in the holo-receptors (16Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 17Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that indeed the conserved lysine 246 at the predicted C terminus of helix 3 plays an important role in the transcriptional actions of VDR. The replacement of this lysine with alanine dramatically reduced AF-2 activity without affecting heterodimerization with RXR or DNA binding activity.It was possible that the inactivity of the lysine 246 mutant could be a consequence of an altered receptor conformation upon ligand binding. It has been postulated that the ligand-induced conformational changes within the receptor result in a more compact folding of the LBD and increased resistance to proteolysis (48Keidel S. LeMotte P. Apfel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our results show that vitamin D treatment of wild type and K246A receptors generates indistinguishable peptide maps with a 33-kDa fragment becoming resistant to tryptic digestion. Given that the helix 3 mutation does not affect this property, it can be concluded that the overall structure of the mutant VDR resembles that of the wild type receptor and that both undergo similar conformational changes after binding of vitamin D. On the other hand, the changes elicited by vitamin D demonstrate that the loss of transcriptional activation by the K246A mutant was not due to a defect in ligand binding. It had been previously shown that replacing this lysine with a glycine also impaired transcriptional activity of VDR and that this mutant receptor was normal with respect to ligand binding (39Whitfield G.R. Hsieh J.-C. Nakajima S. MacDonald P.N. Thompson P.D. Jurutka P.W. Haussler C.A. Haussler M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1166-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Our studies also reveal that not only the C-terminal domain of the receptor but also the conserved lysine 246 residue are required for interaction with SRC-1. The transcriptionally inactive mutant receptor K246A was found to be defective for in vitro binding to the coactivators SRC-1, ACTR, and CBP. Functional studies also show that overexpression of SRC-1 in COS-7 cells enhanced ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by VDR and that lysine 246 is essential for this function. These results suggest that the transcriptional defect of this mutant results from its inability to recruit coactivators upon vitamin D binding. The fact that this mutant does not interact with the coactivators suggests subtle differences in conformation between the native and mutant VDR that were not detected at the level of resolution afforded by the protease digestion assay. The transcriptional activities of the thyroid hormone and the estrogen receptors were reported to be also strongly reduced when the conserved lysine was replaced with another amino acid (35Henttu P.M.A. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 36O′Donnell A.L. Koenig R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 4: 715-720Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 37Helmer E.B. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 38Palomino T. Barettino D. Aranda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mutant estrogen receptor also fails to interact with SRC-1 upon estrogen binding (35Henttu P.M.A. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These results as well as our results with the VDR indicate that residues in helix 12 as well as the lysine residue in helix 3 are required to form the surface by which the nuclear receptors interact with different coactivators. Mutation K246A could destabilize the helix 3-helix 12 interaction that appears to be important for generating an efficient AF-2. Because both the charged residues in helix 12 and the lysine residue in helix 3 are exposed on the surface of the ligand-binding domain (9Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), they may generate the hydrophilic surface of interaction with the coactivators required to mediate AF-2 activity (35Henttu P.M.A. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).In addition to their inability to stimulate transcription of a reporter gene containing a positive VDRE, our results also reveal that the VDR mutants are unable to inhibit retinoic acid-mediated transactivation of the RARβ2 promoter. We have previously observed that the ability of a mutant VDR lacking the last 12 C-terminal amino acids to mediate transrepression by vitamin D was strongly decreased (47Jiménez-Lara A.M. Aranda A. Endocrinology. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Our present results indicate that the integrity of not only helix 12 but also helix 3 is essential for the dominant negative activity of VDR. The requirement of the residues responsible for AF-2 activity suggests that titration of coactivators or common associated proteins may be involved in the inhibitory effect of vitamin D, and in agreement with this hypothesis over-expression of E1A, which can act as a RARβ2 promoter-specific coactivator, significantly reversed repression by vitamin D (47Jiménez-Lara A.M. Aranda A. Endocrinology. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). These results also indicate that vitamin D-dependent transactivation and transrepression might depend on similar or the same interaction surfaces, although we cannot dismiss the possibility that the proteins interacting might be different.Our results have also demonstrated an unanticipated property of the VDR mutants. They can enhance the response of the AP-1 containing collagenase promoter to TPA, a characteristic not shared by the native receptor. Although several receptors have been shown to antagonize the effect of TPA or c-Jun on the collagenase promoter, the functional interaction of nuclear receptors with AP-1 is complex, and Fos and Jun can have cell-specific inhibitory and stimulatory effects on transcription activation by nuclear receptors (8Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some unliganded mutants of the thyroid hormone receptors have an effect similar to that of the liganded VDR mutants shown here (49Ways D.K. Qin W. Cook P. Parker P.J. Menke J.B. Hao E. Smith M. Jones C. Hershman J.M. Geffner M.E. Su F. Samuels H.H. Usala S.U. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1112-1120PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the VDR mutants have the common characteristic of being AF-2-defective suggests the involvement of coactivators in this property. A good candidate for being implicated in this function is CBP/p300, which also plays an essential coactivator role for several classes of transcription factors, including the AP-1 complex (26Torchia J.

Overexpression of CBP has been shown to relieve AP-1 antagonism by the retinoic acid and glucocorticoid receptors, consistent with the hypothesis that competition between AP-1 and nuclear receptors for limiting amounts of CBP/p300 accounts for transrepression (26Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). We have shown that vitamin D does not enhance binding of CBP to the helix 3 and helix 12 VDR mutants, which could allow a greater availability of this common coactivator for the TPA-inducible signal transduction pathway. On the other hand, we cannot dismiss the possibility that the mutations create a new surface for interaction with other coactivator proteins or that they abolished interaction with putative inhibitory factors. Therefore, the mechanism by which the VDR mutants enhance c-Jun-mediated transactivation is unclear, and further work will be required to explain this effect.In summary, our results have established that AF-2 activity of the VDR depends on the conserved lysine in helix 3 and support the view that recruitment of coactivators is essential in vitamin D-dependent transactivation as well as in vitamin D-dependent transrepression. Moreover, the facts that mutation of this lysine also abolishes ligand-independent transactivation by the thyroid hormone receptor (37Helmer E.B. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 38Palomino T. Barettino D. Aranda A. J. Biol.

Future studies will hopefully clarify the role of different coactivator complexes in the diverse transcriptional actions of the nuclear receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2052765967,"We have cloned and characterized murine Nek3 (NIMA-related kinase 3), a novel mammalian gene product structurally related to the cell cycle-regulatory kinase NIMA of Aspergillus nidulans. By RNase protection, low levels of Nek3 expression could be detected in all organs examined, regardless of proliferative index. In contrast to Nek1 and Nek2, Nek3 levels were not particularly elevated in either the male or the female germ line. Nek3 levels showed at most marginal variations through the cell cycle, but they were elevated in G0-arrested, quiescent fibroblasts. Furthermore, no cell cycle-dependent changes in Nek3 activity could be detected, and no effects upon cell cycle progression could be observed upon antibody microinjection or overexpression of either wild-type or catalytically inactive Nek3. Finally, Nek3 was found to be a predominantly cytoplasmic enzyme. These data indicate that Nek3 differs from previously characterized Neks with regard to all parameters investigated, including organ specificity of expression, cell cycle dependence of expression and activity, and subcellular localization. Hence, the structural similarity between mammalian Neks may not necessarily be indicative of a common function, and it is possible that some members of this kinase family may perform functions that are not directly related to cell cycle control.

Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) 1The abbreviation used is: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FCS, fetal calf serum; Nek, NIMA-related kinase. are well established as key regulators of the eukaryotic cell cycle (1Norbury C.

Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). In addition, genetic data demonstrate a cell cycle-regulatory role for several protein kinases that are not regulated by associated cyclin subunits. One such cyclin-independent kinase, termed NIMA (for neverin mitosis, gene A), was identified in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, and shown to play a crucial role at the G2 to M transition (4Osmani S.A. Pu R.T. Morris N.R. Cell. 1988; 53: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 5Osmani A.H. McGuire S.L. Osmani S.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 283-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). InAspergillus, lack of NIMA function results in a cell cycle arrest in G2 (6Oakley B.R. Morris N.R. J.

Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 114-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while overexpression of thenimA gene causes the premature onset of mitotic events, such as depolymerization of cytoplasmic microtubules, formation of abnormal mitotic spindles, and chromatin condensation (4Osmani S.A.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, the overexpression of NIMA in heterologous organisms and cell types was reported to result in untimely chromatin condensation, reminiscent of the effects produced by NIMA overexpression in Aspergillus(9O'Connell M.J. Norbury C. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4926-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10Lu K.P. Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 81: 413-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In view of the evolutionary conservation of Cdks and other important cell cycle regulators, these data suggested that regulatory cascades involving NIMA-related kinases might be conserved in higher eukaryotes (11Osmani S.A. Ye X.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A search for potential NIMA homologues has led to the description of NIMA-related kinases (Neks) from several species. These include Kin3p/Npk1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Schweitzer B. Philippsen P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 13Jones D.G. Rosamond J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 90: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), fin1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (14Krien M. Bugg S. Palatsides M. Asouline G. Morimyo M. Connell M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 967-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the mammalian kinases Nek1, Nek2, Nek3, and Stk2 (15Letwin K. Mizzen L. Motro B. Ben-David Y. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3521-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Levedakou E.N. He M. Baptist E.W. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Welcsh P.L. Simmons A. Naylor S.L. Leach R.J. Lewis T.B. Bowcock A.

However, the only kinase shown to functionally complement a nimA ts mutation inAspergillus is NIM-1, isolated from the related filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa (18Pu R.T. Xu G. Wu L. Vierula J. O'Donnell K. Ye X.S. Osmani S.A. J . Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18110-18116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, although all the NIMA-related kinases described above share considerable sequence similarity with NIMA, one critical, unresolved question concerns the functional relationships between these kinases and NIMA. Another important task will be to determine to what extent the mammalian Neks (Nek1, Nek2, Nek3, and Stk2) share common or overlapping functions. Mammalian Neks display a high degree of sequence similarity over the N-terminal catalytic domains, but, at the level of primary structure, they show little if any conservation over the C-terminal noncatalytic domains (19Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In order to assess whether the multiple mammalian Neks are likely to perform divergent, similar, or redundant functions, it is therefore essential to carry out biochemical studies on the individual family members. The mammalian kinase most closely related to NIMA is Nek2, and accordingly, Nek2 has received most attention so far. Similar to NIMA, Nek2 is cell cycle-regulated in terms of both abundance and activity (17Schultz S.J. Fry A.M. Sutterlin C. Ried T. Nigg E.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 625-635PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fry A.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12899-12905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, whereas NIMA has been implicated predominantly in chromatin condensation (11Osmani S.A. Ye X.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), recent studies indicate that one important function of Nek2 relates to the centrosome cycle (21Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Nek2 localizes to the centrosome, and overexpression of active Nek2 profoundly affects centrosome structure in cultured cells. Nek2 is highly expressed in testis (22Rhee K. Wolgemuth D.J. Development. 1997; 124: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tanaka K. Parvinen M. Nigg E.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Arama E. Yanai A. Kilfin G. Bernstein A. Motro B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1813-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the same is true for Nek1 (15Letwin K. Mizzen L. Motro B. Ben-David Y. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3521-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, Nek1 and Nek2 display different expression patterns during spermatogenesis, suggesting that they may perform distinct functions. We have previously isolated a partial cDNA for human Nek3 (17Schultz S.J. Fry A.M. Sutterlin C. Ried T. Nigg E.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 625-635PubMed Google Scholar), but this cDNA lacked the coding information for the N-terminal end domain, and no biochemical studies on the Nek3 protein have been reported. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and biochemical characterization of a 56-kDa murine protein kinase, termed mNek3, that almost certainly represents the mouse homologue of human Nek3. Using cDNA probes and monospecific anti-Nek3 antibodies, we have studied several basic properties of this kinase. In particular, we have asked whether Nek3 is likely to play a role in cell cycle regulation, and to what extent its properties might resemble those determined recently for Nek2. Our results do not rigorously exclude an involvement of Nek3 in cell cycle control, but they provide no positive evidence to support such a role. Moreover, they clearly show that the properties of Nek3 differ profoundly from those determined previously for Nek2. Thus, despite their structural similarities, mammalian NIMA-related kinases may well perform widely different functions. A mouse brain cDNA library in λZap II (Stratagene) was screened with a human Nek3 cDNA fragment (XhoI-XbaI, nucleotides 617–1555; Ref. 17Schultz S.J. Fry A.M. Sutterlin C. Ried T. Nigg E.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 625-635PubMed Google Scholar), labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products). Phages were converted into pBlueScript (SK−) byin vivo excision, and inserts were sequenced. One plasmid, termed pBS-mNek3, was found to contain the entire coding sequence of mouse Nek3. A PvuII-PvuII fragment excised from pBS-mNek3 was inserted into the PstI site of a pBluescript-myc vector carrying the myc epitope tag (25Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to yield pBS-myc-mNek3. Myc-tagged mNek3 was then excised as aHindIII-XbaI fragment and inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pRcCMV (Invitrogen Corp.), to generate pCMV-myc-mNek3. A catalytically inactive mNek3 mutant (mNek3-D143A) was prepared by changing Asp-143 to Ala, using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). For preparation of protein extracts, testis tissue from 5-week-old mice was homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes/KOH pH 7.4, 5 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 30 μg/ml DNase I, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1% aprotinin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 0.3 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 μg/ml heparin). Protein extracts from mouse intestine were prepared in the same way, except that, prior to homogenization in lysis buffer, intestines were thoroughly rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1% aprotinin). Following the determination of protein concentration, each sample was mixed with an equal volume of gel sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. RNA purification and RNase protection assays were performed as described (23Tanaka K. Parvinen M. Nigg E.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An antisense RNA probe was prepared by transcribing a cDNA fragment from pBS-mNek3 (nucleotides 738–1145; GenBank™ AF093416). The affinity-purified anti-Nek2 antibody PepN2 (23Tanaka K. Parvinen M. Nigg E.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the anti-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein monoclonal antibody D5 (26Reuter R. Lehner C.F. Nigg E.A. Luhrmann R. FEBS Lett. 1986; 201: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and the affinity-purified anti-Cdc2 antibody AR8 (27Krek W. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) were described previously, and the anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody was obtained commercially (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A rabbit antibody (PepN3) was raised against a synthetic 29-amino acid peptide (pepN3), corresponding to residues 424–452 of human Nek3 (17Schultz S.J. Fry A.M. Sutterlin C. Ried T. Nigg E.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 625-635PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Antibodies were affinity-purified, using the pepN3 peptide coupled to an insoluble support (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). A mouse monoclonal antibody, 5F2G6, was prepared using the same pepN3 peptide for immunization (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Peptide competition experiments were carried out as described (23Tanaka K. Parvinen M. Nigg E.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), using the antigenic peptide pepN3 or a structurally unrelated peptide, pepN2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), for control. Immunoblotting was performed using primary antibodies at 1 μg/ml (23Tanaka K. Parvinen M. Nigg E.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for detection. Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and U2OS human osteosarcoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 IU/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively). For G0 arrest, cells were serum-starved for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without FCS. Cells were synchronized at G1/S by a 24 h addition of medium containing 20% FCS and aphidicolin (5 μg/ml) to G0-arrested cells, and at S phase by a 4-h release of aphidicolin-arrested cells into drug-free medium. M phase-arrested cells were collected by gentle pipetting after a 7-h incubation in nocodazole (0.4 μg/ml, Sigma), and G1 cells were obtained by a 5-h release from the nocodazole block. Cell cycle profiles were determined by flow cytometric analysis of DNA content (20Fry A.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12899-12905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), using a Becton Dickinson FACScan and Lysis II software. Transient transfections were performed on U2OS cells seeded onto HCl-treated glass coverslips at a density of 1 × 105 cells per 35-mm dish with 5 μg of plasmid DNA, using calcium phosphate precipitates as described (28Krek W. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3331-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Swiss 3T3 cells were lysed on ice for 10 min in NEB buffer (50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 5 mmMnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 30 μg/ml DNase I, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 0.3 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml heparin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1% aprotinin), and lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from G0-arrested Swiss 3T3 cells were prepared as described previously (29Grayson J. Williams R.S. Yu Y.T. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described (21Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), except that cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization with acetone for 30 s at −20 °C. The anti-myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 was used as undiluted hybridoma supernatant, whereas affinity-purified PepN3 antibodies were used at 10 μg/ml. In vitro translated mNek3 or whole cell lysates were diluted 10 times with NEB buffer, and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Nek3 antibody (5F2G6) or nonspecific mouse IgG (Sigma), both at 20 μg/ml, and immune complexes were isolated using protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 0.5× NEB buffer and twice with 50 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.4), 5 mm MnCl2, and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 30 μl of 50 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.4), 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 7.5 μg/ml heparin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in the presence of casein as a substrate (1.4 mg/ml). Kinase reactions were stopped by addition of 0.5 volumes of gel sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. Following Coomassie Blue staining, gels were dried and exposed to RX film (Fuji Photo Film). To isolate the mouse homologue of human Nek3, a mouse brain cDNA library was screened with a human Nek3 cDNA fragment. Of two independent phages isolated from 106 plaques, one carried a cDNA insert that encompassed the other. Sequencing of the longer cDNA revealed a single open reading frame, coding for a 511-amino acid protein (GenBank™ accession number AF093416). As described below, this protein almost certainly represents the murine homologue of human Nek3, and, therefore, we refer to it as murine Nek3 (mNek3). Although the presumptive 5′-untranslated region of this cDNA lacks an in-frame stop codon, we believe that the first methionine represents the initiating methionine of mNek3, and that the isolated cDNA codes for the entire mNek3 protein. First, the nucleotide sequence surrounding this methionine conforms to the Kozak consensus sequence for initiation methionines (30Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Second, and more importantly, thein vitro translated mNek3 protein was found to comigrate exactly with the endogenous mNek3 protein detectable by anti-Nek3 antibodies in Swiss 3T3 whole cell lysates (see Fig. 3A). The mNek3 protein displays a typical serine/threonine protein kinase domain within its N-terminal half. Data base searches revealed that this domain shares greatest similarity with NIMA-related kinases, as expected. Within the C-terminal non-catalytic region, however, there were no obvious similarities to any known proteins, except for human Nek3. As shown in Fig. 1, mNek3 shows 74% overall identity to human Nek3. The published human Nek3 sequence lacks the first two kinase subdomains, but over the remainder of the catalytic domain, human and murine Nek3 show 90% identity. In comparison, the catalytic domain of mNek3 shows significantly lower degrees of identity to murine Nek1 (55%), Nek2 (43%), or Stk2 (44%), and it shows 42% identity with A. nidulans NIMA. Concerning the non-catalytic C-terminal end domains of NIMA-related kinases, it is striking that both murine and human Nek3 lack predicted coiled-coil regions. This contrasts with the evolutionary conservation of coiled-coil regions in other NIMA-related kinases (19Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), includingAspergillus NIMA itself (4Osmani S.A. Pu R.T. Morris N.R. Cell. 1988; 53: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), mammalian Nek1 and Nek2 (15Letwin K. Mizzen L. Motro B. Ben-David Y. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3521-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar,17Schultz S.J. Fry A.M. Sutterlin C. Ried T. Nigg E.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 625-635PubMed Google Scholar), budding yeast Kin3p/Npk1p (12Schweitzer B. Philippsen P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 13Jones D.G. Rosamond J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 90: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and fission yeast fin1 (14Krien M. Bugg S. Palatsides M. Asouline G. Morimyo M. Connell M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 967-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the organ specificity of the expression of mNek3 mRNA, RNase protection assays were performed on total RNA prepared from various mouse organs,i.e. liver, lung, kidney, spleen, brain, heart, small intestine, large intestine, ovary, testis, skin, and thymus. As an internal control, the expression of the transcription factor NF-Ya was analyzed in parallel. This factor had previously been shown to be expressed in a fairly uniform manner among different types of cells (31Schmidt E.E. Schibler U. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 467-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). When DNA-equivalent amounts of RNA from the different organs were analyzed (Fig. 2A), the greatest abundance of Nek3 mRNA was detected in small intestine (IS). Much weaker signals were obtained for most other organs, including testis. It seems, therefore, that no correlation exists between Nek3 expression levels and the proliferative index of a particular tissue. Overall, Nek3 transcript levels appeared to be roughly comparable to those of NF-Ya, which has previously been estimated to be present at approximately 10 transcripts per cell (31Schmidt E.E. Schibler U. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 467-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This suggests that Nek3 mRNA is expressed at relatively low levels in all organs analyzed here. It is important to bear in mind that the amount of total RNA per DNA equivalent differs widely among different cell types (31Schmidt E.E. Schibler U. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 467-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). When the amounts of Nek3 transcripts were standardized to equal amounts of RNA (Fig. 2B), rather than to DNA equivalents of RNA (Fig. 2A), qualitatively similar results were obtained, although the differences between organs were quantitatively less pronounced (compare Fig. 2B with 2A); again, highest levels of Nek3 mRNA were seen in intestine, while testis and ovaries showed no particularly high levels of Nek3 expression. This latter result is in striking contrast to data reported previously for murine Nek1 and Nek2. Both of these kinases are in fact highly expressed in testis, although their precise expression patterns during spermatogenesis differ (15Letwin K. Mizzen L. Motro B. Ben-David Y. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3521-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Rhee K. Wolgemuth D.J. Development. 1997; 124: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tanaka K. Parvinen M.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1813-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To extend the above expression studies to the protein level, an antibody (PepN3) was raised against a peptide that is highly conserved between mouse and human Nek3 (see Fig. 1). When tested by immunoblotting on total extracts from G0-arrested Swiss 3T3 cells, the PepN3 antibody recognized a single protein migrating at approximately 56 kDa (Fig. 3A,lane 3). This band comigrated exactly within vitro translated mNek3 (Fig. 3A,lanes 1 and 2), confirming that the coding sequence reported here almost certainly represents the complete mNek3 protein. The PepN3 immune reaction was completely abolished by preincubation of PepN3 with the immunogenic peptide, pepN3, but not by incubation with a control peptide, pepN2 (Fig. 3A,lanes 4 and 5, respectively). Finally, a single band migrating at the exact same position was also revealed when immunoblots were performed on Swiss 3T3 total cell lysates with the monoclonal anti-Nek3 antibody 5F2G6 (Fig. 3A,lane 6). Fig. 3B shows the abundance of Nek3 protein in murine intestine and testis, respectively (central panel). For comparison, the left-hand panel shows the protein profiles of these samples, as revealed by Coomassie Blue staining, confirming equal loading. Theright-hand panel shows the results of probing the same samples with antibodies against Nek2, one of the Neks shown previously to be expressed predominantly in testis (22Rhee K. Wolgemuth D.J. Development. 1997; 124: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tanaka K. Parvinen M. Nigg E.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Arama E. Yanai A. Kilfin G. Bernstein A. Motro B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1813-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). From these data it is clear that Nek3 is expressed at comparable levels in both testis and intestine, in striking contrast to Nek2. It is also noteworthy that the Nek3 expression seen at the protein level does not strictly parallel that seen at the mRNA level (compare Figs.3B and 2A). This suggests that posttranscriptional mechanisms may contribute to control the abundance of Nek3 protein in particular cell types. As NIMA-related kinases might be expected to play a role in cell cycle regulation, we examined the protein level of mNek3 throughout the cell cycle. To this end, extracts were prepared from synchronized Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and analyzed by immunoblotting with the PepN3 antibody. Cells were synchronized in G0 by serum starvation, at the G1/S phase boundary by aphidicolin treatment, in S phase by release from the aphidicolin block, in M phase by nocodazole treatment, and in early G1 phase by release from the nocodazole block. Exponentially growing cells were analyzed in parallel. Cell extracts were normalized for protein content, before the amounts of mNek3 were determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 4A, upper panel). For control, aliquots of each sample were also probed with antibodies against the Cdc2 protein kinase (Fig. 4A, lower panel), and subjected to analysis by flow cytometry (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4A, mNek3 protein levels displayed at most minor variations throughout the cell cycle, and no evidence could be obtained for mobility shifts that might be indicative of posttranslational modifications. As expected, levels of Cdc2 protein were also constant throughout the cell cycle (27Krek W. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, whereas Cdc2 protein was virtually absent from G0-arrested, quiescent cells (Fig. 4A, lane 6, lower panel), we have consistently observed that Nek3 was more highly expressed in G0-arrested cells than in proliferating cells (Fig. 4A, upper panel; comparelane 6 with lanes 1–5). Thus, in striking contrast to Cdc2, the expression of mNek3 is not limited to proliferating cells, and, in fact, is enhanced in quiescent cells. Next, we wished to determine the activity of mNek3 through the cell cycle. To optimize the conditions for measuring kinase activity intrinsic to mNek3,in vitro translated mNek3 was used. Wild-type mNek3 and a mutant form of mNek3, carrying a point mutation in the putative ATP binding site (mNek3-D143A), were produced in a reticulocyte lysate, and samples were diluted into NEB buffer containing 0.1% deoxycholic acid. (For presently unknown reasons, the presence of this detergent was found to be critical for our ability to measure mNek3 kinase activityin vitro.) Following immunoprecipitation of the translation products, kinase assays were performed in the presence of β-casein, a protein previously shown to be a good substrate for several NIMA-related kinases (15Letwin K. Mizzen L. Motro B. Ben-David Y. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3521-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 20Fry A.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. J. Biol.

Fig. 5 shows that both wild-type mNek3 and the catalytically inactive mNek3-D143A mutant were produced at similar levels (panel A), yet only wild-type mNek3 showed strong kinase activity toward β-casein, while mNek3-D143A was inactive (panel B). Likewise, only wild-type mNek3 displayed apparent autophosphorylation activity (panel B, lane 1). These data show that the above assay conditions allow a reliable measurement of mNek3 activity. To determine the activity of endogenous mNek3 through the cell cycle, mNek3 activity was measured in immunoprecipitates prepared from Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts synchronized at different stages of the cell cycle (Fig. 5D, lanes labeled a). For each sample, the recovery of mNek3 was monitored by immunoblotting (Fig. 5C, lanes labeled a). As a control for specificity, parallel analyses were performed on immunoprecipitates prepared from each sample using control mouse IgG (Fig. 5, Cand D, lanes labeled c). As shown in Fig. 5C, roughly similar amounts of mNek3 were recovered from exponentially growing cells (Expo) and from cells synchronized at particular cell cycle"
https://openalex.org/W1816191601,"The pheromone nereithione (cysteine-glutathione disulfide), which is released by swimming females of the polychaete Nereis succinea to activate spawning behavior of N. succinea males, has recently been identified and synthesized. Nereithione activates sperm release at less than 10(-6) M, one to two orders of magnitude less than oxidized glutathione or any other glutathione derivative tested. The glutathione fragment gamma-glu-cys inhibited sperm release. Nereithione aroused three components of the male nuptial behavior: circling, sperm release, and accelerated swimming. Electrophysiological activity elicited by nereithione near the sperm release site consisted of initial large spikes, cyclic bursting activity, and small spikes lasting up to a minute and was dose dependent, rapid, reversible, and repeatable. This preparation is an excellent model system for characterizing the receptors and functions of a marine pheromone."

However, the upstream signals by which SV activates downstream apoptotic effectors, including caspases, remain unclear. Here we report that in AT-3 prostate carcinoma cells, SV infection decreases superoxide (O⨪2) levels within minutes of infection as monitored by an aconitase activity assay. This SV-induced decrease in O⨪2 levels appears to activate or modulate cell death, as a recombinant SV expressing the O⨪2 scavenging enzyme, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD), potentiates SV-induced apoptosis. A recombinant SV expressing a mutant form of SOD, which has reduced SOD activity, has no effect. The potentiation of SV-induced apoptosis by wild type SOD is because of its ability to scavenge intracellular O⨪2 rather than its ability to promote the generation of hydrogen peroxide. Pyruvate, a peroxide scavenger, does not affect the ability of wild type SOD to potentiate cell death; and increasing the intracellular catalase activity via a recombinant SV vector has no effect on SV-induced apoptosis. Moreover, increasing intracellular O⨪2 by treatment of 3T3 cells with paraquat protects them from SV-induced death.

The elimination of virus-infected cells via apoptosis is believed to be a mechanism used by the host to limit the spread of progeny virus to neighboring cells and thus to decrease the host viral burden (11Shen Y. Shenk T.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). However, if the primary targets in vivo are nonreplenishing cells like neurons, virus-induced apoptosis can also have devastating consequences for the host. For example, age-dependent encephalitis and mortality induced by SV is correlated with the ability of SV to induce apoptosis in neurons in the central nervous system of mice (12Griffin D.E. Levine B. Tyor W.R. Tucker P.C. Hardwick J.M. Arch. Virol. 1994; 9: 31-39Google Scholar, 13Lewis J. Wesselingh S.L. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanistic studies of SV-induced apoptosis indicate that SV engages an apoptotic pathway used by many death stimuli (14Nava V.E. Rosen A. Veliuona M.A. Clem R.J. Levine B. Hardwick J.M. J.

Rosen A. Veliuona M.A. Clem R.J. Levine B. Hardwick J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 452-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SV-induced death can also be blocked by the pluripotent anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2 (8Levine B. Huang Q. Isaacs J.T. Reed J.C. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M.

These data suggest that SV triggers a common death execution pathway, but the state changes induced by SV which set this common pathway in motion remain unclear. Maintenance of the cellular redox balance is believed to play an important role in regulating survival (17Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar), and multiple lines of evidence indicate that disruption of the redox equilibrium in favor of oxidants, a condition defined as “oxidative stress,” may activate apoptosis (18Lennon S.V. Martin S.J. Cotter T.G. Cell Prolif. 1991; 24: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 19Zhong L.-T. Sarafian R. Kane D.J. Charles A.C. Mah S.P. Edwards R.H. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl.

In cultured cells, the addition of oxidants or inhibition of antioxidant defenses leads to apoptosis (18Lennon S.V. Martin S.J. Cotter T.G.

Similarly, overexpression of antioxidant enzymes or treatment of cells with antioxidants has been shown to prevent apoptotic death (21Ferrari G. Yan C.Y.I. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2857-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mayer M. Noble M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7596-7600Crossref Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 23Greenlund L.J.S.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4385-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by a disruption in redox homeostasis appears to be a mechanism of neuronal loss in a broad range of sporadic and inherited neuropathological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (25Fariello R.G. Funct. Neurol. 1988; 3: 407-412PubMed Google Scholar), Alzheimer's disease (26Cotman C.W. Anderson A.J. Mol.

Neurosci. 1995; 13: 3669-3680Google Scholar). Moreover, genetic studies indicate that inherited mutations in antioxidant defenses may also induce neuropathology (29Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D.

For example, a subset of patients with a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been found to carry mutations in the gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) (29Rosen D.R.

Mutations in the Cu,Zn-SOD gene appear to diminish the threshold for activation of apoptosis in neurons, and antioxidants can restore the threshold for activation of cell death to levels seen in cells carrying wild type Cu,Zn-SOD (33Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Borchelt D.R. Gwinn R. Valentine J.S. Sisodia S. Wong P. Lee M. Hahn H. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3024-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that oxidative stress is a mediator of apoptotic death, although cell death induced by certain stimuli can be triggered independent of oxidative stress (34Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kosaka H. Kamiile W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1995; 374: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 35Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). To examine whether apoptosis induced by SV is activated by oxidative stress, we previously evaluated the effects of antioxidants on SV-induced apoptosis in cultured cells (36Lin K.-I. Lee S.-H. Narayanan R. Baraban J.M. Hardwick J.M. Ratan R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Our results showed that a host of antioxidants, including metal chelators, inhibitors of lipid peroxidation, or scavengers of peroxide failed to inhibit SV-induced apoptosis, suggesting that oxidative stress is not a mediator of SV-induced death (36Lin K.-I. Lee S.-H. Narayanan R. Baraban J.M. Hardwick J.M. Ratan R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, we did not monitor directly individual reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide (O⨪2) or peroxide (H2O2), so we could not definitively exclude a role for these ROS in regulating SV-induced death. In this study, we examine the role of O⨪2 and H2O2 in SV-induced apoptosis. AT-3 rat prostate carcinoma cells and 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured as described previously (36Lin K.-I. Lee S.-H.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For viability studies, 103 AT-3 cells/well or 104 3T3 fibroblasts/well were seeded in 96-well plates. 1 day after plating, recombinant SVs were added at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 plaque-forming units/cell. Cell viability was determined by measuring the cell-associated lactate dehydrogenase activity as described previously (37Lin K.-I. DiDonato J.A. Hoffmann A. Hardwick J.M. Ratan R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For the experiments involving pyruvate and paraquat (1,1′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinum dichloride) (Sigma), AT-3 cells or 3T3 fibroblasts were pretreated with pyruvate or paraquat for 1 h and then infected with recombinant SVs. Viability assays were performed 24 h later as described above. A cDNA fragment containing Cu,Zn-SOD (SOD wt) or Cu,Zn-SOD with a glycine to serine mutation at codon 41 (SOD M) was cut from thePstI/EcoRI sites of PVL1392 and was then blunt end ligated into the BstEII site of an SV vector (dsTE12Q) in forward and reverse orientations. A polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragment containing catalase of Hemophilus influenza from pWB5 plasmid (a gift from Dr. William Bishai) (38Bishai W.R. Smith H.O. Barcak G.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2914-2921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was also blunt end ligated into the BstEII site of a recombinant SV vector in forward and reverse orientations. These recombinant SV vectors were linearized with XhoI and then transcribed in vitro with SP6 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resultant RNA transcripts were transfected into baby hamster kidney cells by the LipofectAMINE method as described previously (37Lin K.-I. DiDonato J.A. Hoffmann A. Hardwick J.M. Ratan R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recombinant SVs were harvested from the supernatant of the culture media of the transfected baby hamster kidney cells. Viral titers were determined by standard plaque assays as described previously. 106 AT-3 cells were infected with recombinant SV-SODs (wt, M or reverse (R)) at an m.o.i. of 10. 16 h postinfection, cells were lysed as described previously (37Lin K.-I. DiDonato J.A. Hoffmann A. Hardwick J.M. Ratan R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). 20 μg of protein from cytoplasmic extracts was boiled in Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed under reducing conditions on 15% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding was inhibited by incubation in Tris-buffered saline and Tween (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing nonfat dried milk for 2 h. Human SOD antibody was diluted in 1% milk, Tris-buffered saline and Tween at 1:5,000. After exposure of membranes to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1.5 h, immunoreactive proteins were detected according to the enhanced chemiluminescent protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 106 AT-3 cells or 3T3 fibroblasts were either infected with SV (AR339) at an m.o.i. of 25 or treated with paraquat. At various intervals after paraquat treatment or SV infection, cells were lightly trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 30 mm sodium citrate, 0.6 mmMnCl2, 0.2 mm NADP+, and 1 unit/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase (39Gardner P.R.

Cells were then homogenized by Tekmar Tissumizer for 10 s in the reaction mixture, and aconitase activity was then determined by the absorbance increase at 340 nm at 25 °C for 30 min in a Molecular Devices SpectraMax 250 thermostatted microplate UV-visible spectrophotometer. The results were expressed as (aconitase activity from each time point/aconitase activity from mock infected or mock treated cells) × 100%. SOD activity was determined by an indirect inhibition assay developed by Oberley and Spitz (42Oberley L.W. Spitz D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 × 105 AT-3 cells were either mock infected or infected with recombinant SV-SODs (wt, M, or R) at an m.o.i. of 10 for 16 h and were then trypsinized. Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.8) and then were homogenized by Tekmar Tissumizer for 1 min. 10 μg of cell homogenates was used for determining SOD activity in 200 μl of reagent containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 5.6 × 10−5m nitro blue tetrazolium, 0.1 mm xanthine, and 0.002 unit of xanthine oxidase. The SOD activity of cell lysates was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the suppression of superoxide-induced formation of formazan from nitro blue tetrazolium at 560 nm for 5 min. Catalase activity was measured as described by Aebi (43Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18246) Google Scholar). 4 × 105 AT-3 cells were mock infected or infected with recombinant SV-catalase (forward and reverse) for 20 h. Cell extracts were then prepared as described above. 10 μg of cell extracts was added to 100 μl of 10 mm H2O2 in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, and the rate of loss of absorbance of H2O2 at 240 nm was monitored for 30 s in a Beckman DU-50 spectrophotometer. 105 AT-3 cells or 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in 12-well plates and were infected with recombinant SV-SOD viruses at an m.o.i. of 10. 2 h after infection, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then the infectious media were harvested at 4, 8, and 24 h postinfection. Virus titers were determined by standard plaque assay on baby hamster kidney cells. For paraquat experiments, 3T3 fibroblasts were treated with 250 μm paraquat 1 h prior to virus infection, and viabilities were assessed as described above at the indicated intervals. Aconitase activity is a sensitive and specific assay for measuring intracellular O⨪2 levels in mammalian cells (44Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). To test whether O⨪2 levels change prior to SV-induced apoptosis, we assayed aconitase activity after SV (AR339) infection in AT-3 rat prostate carcinoma cells. Previous studies have established that SV (AR399) triggers cell death with morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis 18–24 h after infection in this cell line (8Levine B. Huang Q. Isaacs J.T. Reed J.C. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 36Lin K.-I. Lee S.-H. Narayanan R. Baraban J.M. Hardwick J.M. Ratan R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). SV (AR339) increased aconitase activity within minutes of binding to and/or infecting AT-3 cells, suggesting that SV decreases O⨪2 prior to the onset of apoptosis (Fig. 1). To verify that aconitase activity is a valid measure of O⨪2 levels in AT-3 cells, we exposed these cells to paraquat, a redox cycling agent capable of generating O⨪2 intracellularly. As expected, we found that paraquat reduces aconitase activity beginning 5 min after drug exposure (Fig. 1). To determine whether decreases in O⨪2 levels regulate SV-induced apoptosis, we generated a recombinant SV that carries the wild type human Cu,Zn-SOD gene (SV-SOD wt). As controls, we inserted a mutated form of the human Cu,Zn-SOD gene (SV-SOD M) and the wild type human Cu,Zn-SOD gene in the reverse orientation (SV-SOD R), into the SV vector. SOD1 is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of O⨪2 into H2O2. The mutated form of SOD1 used in this study has a glycine to serine mutation at codon 41. This mutation, which is predicted to disrupt the integrity of the β sheet initiated at codon 41 and the adjoining active site loop containing the copper ion, was identified previously in a pedigree of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and has been shown to cause a significant reduction in SOD1 activity in cultured lymphoblasts of affected patients compared with SOD1 activity in lymphoblasts from controls (32Tsuda T. Munthasser S. Fraser P.E. Percy M.E. Rainero I. Vaula G. Pinessi L. Bergamini L. Vignocchi G. Crapper McLachlan D.R. Tatton W.G. St. George-Hyslop P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Infection of AT-3 cells with SV-SOD wt significantly enhances cell death compared with infection with recombinant SV-SOD M or recombinant SV-SOD R (Fig. 2A). The potentiating effect of wild type SOD1 on SV-induced apoptosis is also observed in 3T3 fibroblasts where 47, 70, or 65% of cells survive after infection with SV-SOD wt, SV-SOD M, or SV-SOD R, respectively (not shown). SOD enzymatic activity was determined in lysates of mock, SV-SOD wt-, SV-SOD M-, or SV-SOD R-infected AT-3 cells. As expected, cells infected with SV-SOD wt significantly increased SOD enzymatic activity (1.7-fold) compared with mock infected cells. By contrast, SOD activity in AT-3 cells infected with SV-SOD M or SV-SOD R is not significantly different from mock infected cells (Fig. 2B). The differences in SOD activity between SV-SOD wt- or SV-SOD M-infected cells could not be attributed to different levels of heterologous SOD protein expression as monitored by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2C). To evaluate whether wild type SOD potentiates cell death by facilitating SV replication, viral titers were assessed in AT-3 cells infected with each recombinant virus. SV-SOD wt, SV-SOD M, and SV-SOD R replicate with equal efficiency at early time points after infection and prior to the appearance of apoptotic morphology (Fig. 3). At 24 h postinfection, the virus production was slightly lower in cells infected with SV-SOD wt compared with virus production of cells infected with SV-SOD M and SV-SOD R. The difference in viral titers detected at later time points likely relates to the decreased viability of cells infected with SV-SOD wt (Fig. 3). Taken together, our results suggest that decreased intracellular O⨪2 levels enhance SV-induced apoptosis without affecting virus replication. Enforced expression of wild type SOD has been shown to result in increased steady-state levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (45Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D. Lab. Invest. 1982; 47: 412-426PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide can induce cytotoxicity by reacting with transition metals such as iron to form highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. To examine whether enhanced generation of H2O2 by wt SOD contributes to the death-promoting effect of recombinant SV-SOD wt, we treated 3T3 fibroblasts with pyruvate, a nonenzymatic scavenger of peroxide (46Desagher S. Glowinski J. Premont J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9060-9067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 1 h prior to infection with recombinant SV-SOD wt, SV-SOD M, or SV-SOD R. Although 2 mm pyruvate completely inhibits cytotoxicity induced by 200 μm hydrogen peroxide in 3T3 (Fig. 4B) or AT-3 cells (not shown), pyruvate (2 mm or 10 mm) has no effect on the potentiation of SV-induced death by wild type SOD1 (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that potentiation of cell death by SV-SOD is not mediated through peroxide. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that SV induces metabolic barriers that prevent intracellular pyruvate from reaching a concentration required for peroxide scavenging. To examine more definitively the role of H2O2in SV-induced apoptosis, we generated a recombinant SV carrying a catalase gene from H. influenza (SV-Cat.). Catalase is an antioxidant enzyme that catalyzes H2O2 into H2O and O2. As a control, we inserted catalase in the reverse orientation into the SV vector. Catalase activity measurements confirmed that infection of AT-3 cells with SV-Cat. resulted in increased levels of catalase activity compared with mock or SV-Cat. R-infected cells (Fig. 5A). To determine the effects of enhanced catalase activity on SV-induced apoptosis, we measured the viability of cells infected with various recombinant viruses at several time points after infection. As shown in Fig. 5B, we found that SV-Cat. and SV-Cat. R triggered cell death with similar kinetics in AT-3 cells. Taken together, these results are consistent with the notion that the potentiating effects of wt SOD on SV-induced death relate to decreased O⨪2 levels and not increased or decreased peroxide levels. Furthermore and consistent with our previous observations (36Lin K.-I. Lee S.-H. Narayanan R. Baraban J.M. Hardwick J.M. Ratan R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 47Esch F. Lin K.-I. Hills A. Zaman K. Baraban J.M. Chatterjee S. Rubin L. Ash D.E. Ratan R.R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4083-4095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these data demonstrate that H2O2 is not a regulator of SV-induced apoptosis. If decreases in superoxide trigger SV-induced death, then increases in intracellular O⨪2 should abrogate SV cytotoxicity. To address this hypothesis, we treated 3T3 fibroblasts with 250 μm paraquat 1 h prior to infection with SV-SOD wt, SV-SOD M, and SV-SOD R. At 24 h postinfection, 250 μm paraquat significantly inhibits cell death induced by SV-SOD wt, SV-SOD M, and SV-SOD R (Fig. 6A). To determine whether paraquat impairs SV replication, virus production from infected 3T3 fibroblasts with or without the treatment of paraquat was measured. Concentrations of paraquat which impair apoptosis do not interfere with virus replication at 4, 8, and 24 h postinfection (Fig. 6B). Stable overexpression of individual antioxidant enzymes in cell lines has been shown to result in increased or decreased levels of other antioxidant enzymes in these lines (48Kelner M.J. Bagnell R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10872-10875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Amstad P. Peskin A. Shah G. Mirault M.-E. Moret R. Zbinden I. Cerutti P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9305-9313Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of SOD1 in NIH/3T3 cells has been shown to alter endogenous glutathione peroxidase, manganase superoxide dismutase, and glutathione transferase activities (48Kelner M.J. Bagnell R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10872-10875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these circumstances, the primary biological effects of modulating the levels of a single antioxidant enzyme may be difficult to evaluate. The recombinant SV expression system overcomes this problem by allowing the expression of heterologous proteins after infection, avoiding the need to generate stable cell lines and limiting the amount of time in which secondary changes can occur. Moreover, because recombinant SV can also induce apoptosis, the role of the expressed heterologous proteins in regulating apoptosis can be evaluated (15Ray C.A. Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Greenstreet T.A. Sleath P.R. Salvesen G.S. Pickup D.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 16Levine B. Goldman J.E. Jiang H.H. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4810-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 37Lin K.-I. DiDonato J.A. Hoffmann A. Hardwick J.M. Ratan R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Herein, we used the recombinant SV system to overexpress SOD1 or catalase in AT-3 cells and to demonstrate a role for O⨪2 but not peroxide in regulating SV-induced death. Several observations suggest that SV infection leads to reduced intracellular O⨪2 levels, leading to activation of cell death. First, aconitase activity, an in situ measure whose levels are inversely proportional to O⨪2 levels (50Patel M. Day B.J. Crapo J.D. Fridovich I. McNamaram J.O. Neuron. 1996; 16: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), increases almost immediately after SV infection. Second, expression of the O⨪2scavenger, SOD, in a recombinant SV vector, accelerates SV-induced apoptosis, whereas a mutated form of SOD, with impaired enzymatic activity, does not (Fig. 2A). Third, the O⨪2generator, paraquat, inhibits SV-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6A). These results suggest that intracellular O⨪2may inhibit components of the death machinery required for SV-induced apoptosis. Of note, intracellular O⨪2 has also been shown to be an endogenous inhibitor of Fas-induced apoptosis (51Clément M.-V. Stamenkovic I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), suggesting that Fas- and SV-induced death may engage similar cell death pathways. Indeed, previous evidence supports the notion that Fas- and SV-induced apoptosis might activate a similar death pathway because both Fas- and SV-induced apoptosis are sensitive to CrmA, a highly specific inhibitor of caspases 1, 4, 5, or 8 (14Nava V.E. Rosen A. Veliuona M.A. Clem R.J. Levine B. Hardwick J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 452-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that Cu,Zn-SOD has a protective role in regulating apoptosis. For example, microinjection of Cu,Zn-SOD delays nerve growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis in sympathetic neurons (23Greenlund L.J.S. Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 303-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Also, overexpression of Cu,Zn-SOD inhibits apoptosis induced by serum or growth factor withdrawal or calcium ionophore treatment in nigral neural cells (52Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Borchelt D.R. Gwinn R. Valentine J.S. Sisodia S. Wong P. Lee M. Hahn H. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3024-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Moreover, transgenicDrosophila that carry a mutated Cu,Zn-SOD gene appeared to have a shortened lifespan (53Philllips J.D. Campbell S.D. Michaud D. Charbonneau M. Hilliker A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2761-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), whereas selective overexpression of the wild type Cu,Zn-SOD gene in motor neurons of Drosophila with defective Cu,Zn-SOD recover 60% of their lifespan (54Parkes T.L. Elia A.J. Dickinson D. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Boulianne G.L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). In mammals, mice lacking Cu,Zn-SOD are more sensitive to axonal injury (55Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F. Brown Jr., R.H. Scott R.W. Snider W.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). These converging lines of inquiry suggest that Cu,Zn-SOD can promote survival in some circumstances. In contrast, transgenic mice overexpressing Cu,Zn-SOD appeared to have significantly fewer thymocytes and are more susceptible to lipopolysaccharide-mediated loss of thymocytes (56Peled-Kamar M. Lotem J. Okon E. Sachs L. Groner Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4985-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Moreover, neurons derived from transgenic mice overexpressing Cu,Zn-SOD also showed higher susceptibility to kainic acid-induced apoptosis (57Bar-Peled O. Korkotian E. Segal M. Groner Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8530-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, constitutive expression of a O⨪2 scavenging enzyme may also sensitize cells to certain kinds of stimuli; these observations are consistent with our observations that overexpression of Cu,Zn-SOD exacerbates SV-induced apoptosis. In contrast to established schemes whereby ROS are increased prior to the activation of apoptosis (58Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 15: 1423-1432Crossref Scopus (643) Google Scholar), we find that intracellular ROS, specifically O⨪2 levels, are decreased soon after SV infection (Fig. 1). The mechanism by which SV triggers the decrease of intracellular O⨪2 is still unclear. However, this finding combined with our previous observation that SV infection leads to increased intracellular glutathione levels (36Lin K.-I. Lee S.-H. Narayanan R. Baraban J.M. Hardwick J.M. Ratan R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) suggests that SV may activate the apoptotic pathway by perturbing the redox equilibrium toward a reduced state rather than an oxidized state. Of note, a decreased production of ROS has also been shown to be an early event in dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in thymocytes (59Wang J.F. Jerrells T.R. Spitzer J.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting a more general role for “reductive stress” in activating cell death. What are the putative targets modified by decreased levels of intracellular O⨪2 which regulate SV-induced death? Our results suggest that decreasing intracellular O⨪2 does not facilitate SV replication because recombinant SV -SOD1 wt replicates as well as the SV-SOD1 M and SV-SOD1 R (Fig. 3). Additionally, paraquat protects from SV-induced apoptosis and does not alter SV replication (Fig. 6B). Therefore, it seems likely that O⨪2may play a role in changing the activity of as yet unidentified cellular targets involved in regulating SV-induced apoptosis. O⨪2 itself is capable of inactivating certain kinases, such as mammalian creatine phosphokinase (60McCord J.M. Russell W.J. OxyRadicals in Molecular Biology and Pathology. Alan, R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 27-35Google Scholar) and the NADH dehydrogenase complex of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (61Zhang Y. Marcillat O. Giulivi C. Ernster L. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16330-16336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the roles of these proteins in apoptosis are still unknown. Another potential target of O⨪2 are the caspases-cysteine-dependent proteases whose activity has been shown to be altered by redox-active agents (62Hampton M.B. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the target modulated by superoxide levels which negatively regulates SV-induced cell death is aconitase or its iron-deficient analog IRP-1, as previous studies from our laboratory showed that the iron chelators do not inhibit SV-induced death in AT3 cells (36Lin K.-I. Lee S.-H. Narayanan R. Baraban J.M. Hardwick J.M. Ratan R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). If decreased IRP-1 activity or increased aconitase activity were the mechanism by which the apoptotic signal is mediated, then iron chelators, which enhance IRP-1 activity and decrease aconitase activity (63Gray N.K. Quick S. Goossen B. Constable A. Hirling H. Kuhn L.C. Hentze M.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), should attenuate SV-induced death. In addition to O⨪2, nitric oxide has also been shown to inhibit SV-induced apoptosis in cultured cells and diminish SV-mediated mortality in mice (64Tucker P.C. Griffin D.E. Choi S. Bui N. Wesselingh S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3972-3977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of fetal mice with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor potentiates SV-induced encephalitis and mortality; in addition, treatment of N18 neuroblastoma cells with nitric acid donors enhances cell survival after SV infection. These results combined with our observations suggest that O⨪2 and nitric oxide are the free radical species that negatively regulate SV-induced apoptosis. Previously, we have demonstrated that SV-induced apoptosis may not result from the generation of ROS, as a panel of antioxidants failed to protect from SV-induced apoptosis (36Lin K.-I. Lee S.-H. Narayanan R. Baraban J.M. Hardwick J.M. Ratan R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Here, in an extension of our previous study, we demonstrate that inhibition of intracellular O⨪2 levels is required for SV-induced apoptosis. These results not only provide insight into the mechanism by which SV transduces its death signal but also broaden the concept of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis; that is, reductive stress may also trigger cells to undergo apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W1549868451,"Bacteria that produce heat-stable enterotoxins (STs), a leading cause of secretory diarrhea, are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. ST stimulates guanylyl cyclase C (GCC) and accumulation of intracellular cyclic GMP ([cGMP]i), which opens the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-related chloride channel, triggering intestinal secretion. Although the signaling cascade mediating ST-induced diarrhea is well characterized, antisecretory therapy targeting this pathway has not been developed. 2-ChloroATP (2ClATP) and its cell-permeant precursor, 2-chloroadenosine (2ClAdo), disrupt ST-dependent signaling in intestinal cells. However, whether the ability to disrupt guanylyl cyclase signaling translates into effective antisecretory therapy remains untested. In this study, the efficacy of 2ClAdo to prevent ST-induced water secretion by human intestinal cells was examined. In Caco-2 human intestinal cells, ST increased [cGMP]i, induced a chloride current, and stimulated net basolateral-to-apical water secretion. This effect on chloride current and water secretion was mimicked by the cell-permeant analog of cGMP, 8-bromo-cGMP. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with 2ClAdo prevented ST-induced increases in [cGMP]i, chloride current and water secretion. Inhibition of the downstream consequences of ST-GCC interaction reflects proximal disruption of cGMP production because 8-bromo-cGMP stimulated chloride current and water secretion in 2ClAdo-treated cells. Thus, this study demonstrates that disruption of guanylyl cyclase signaling is an effective strategy for antisecretory therapy and provides the basis for developing mechanism-based treatments for enterotoxigenic diarrhea.—Zhang, W., Mannan, I., Schulz, S., Parkinson, S.

Elongin B does not directly affect Elongin A activity in the absence of Elongin C; instead, Elongin B appears to bind directly to Elongin C and to promote its interaction with Elongin A.Molecular cloning of the mammalian Elongin B gene revealed that it encodes a 118-amino acid protein composed of an ∼84 residue NH2-terminal ubiquitin-like domain fused to an ∼34 residue COOH-terminal tail (2Garrett K.P. Aso T. Bradsher J.N. Foundling S.I. Lane W.S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7172-7176Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin family comprises a diverse collection of proteins that fall into at least three classes. One class is composed of ubiquitin, which is conjugated by E2/E3 ubiquitin ligases to a variety of proteins involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control and targets them for degradation by the proteosome (12Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 13Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A second class is composed of a small set of ribosomal proteins that contain NH2-terminal ubiquitin moieties, which are proteolytically removed following incorporation of these proteins into ribosomes (14Ozkaynak E. Finley D. Solomon M.J. Varshavsky A. EMBO. J. 1987; 6: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 15Finley D. Bartel B. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1989; 338: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). A third class includes Elongin B and a growing number of other ubiquitin-like proteins. Among the members of this class are NEDD8/Rub1p, SUMO, and Rad23, which have roles in cell cycle control, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and DNA repair, respectively (16Lammer D. Mathias N.

In this report, we demonstrate that the Elongin B ubiquitin-like domain is necessary and sufficient for interaction of Elongin B with Elongin C and for regulation of Elongin A activity. In addition, by site-directed mutagenesis of the Elongin B ubiquitin-like domain, we identify a short Elongin B region that is important for its interaction with Elongin C and that is evolutionarily conserved in Elongin B homologs fromD. melanogaster and C. elegans.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have investigated Elongin B sequences required for its interaction with Elongin C. Mammalian Elongin B is a 118-amino acid protein composed of an ∼84 amino acid ubiquitin-like domain fused to an ∼34 amino acid COOH-terminal tail (2Garrett K.P. Aso T. Bradsher J.N. Foundling S.I. Lane W.S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7172-7176Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The Elongin B ubiquitin-like domain shares ∼30% sequence identity with ubiquitin. Other ubiquitin-like proteins include NEDD8 and its yeast homologue Rub1p, SUMO, and Rad23, which have roles in cell cycle control, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and DNA repair, respectively (16Lammer D.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). These ubiquitin-like proteins exhibit a variable degree of similarity with ubiquitin, ranging from more than 50% sequence identity (NEDD8 and Rub1p) to less than 20% identity (SUMO). Despite the variation in their primary sequences, ubiquitin, NEDD8, Rub1p, and SUMO have very similar tertiary structures (33Rao-Naik C. delaCruz W. Laplaza J.M. Tan S. Callis J. Fisher A.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34983-34991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although a crystal structure of Elongin B has not yet been reported, Elongin B can be modeled as ubiquitin (2Garrett K.P. Aso T. Bradsher J.N. Foundling S.I. Lane W.S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7172-7176Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Analysis of the functions of Elongin B mutants has revealed that the Elongin B ubiquitin-like domain is sufficient for its interaction with Elongin C in vivo and in vitro and for reconstitution of the transcriptionally active Elongin complex in vitro. Furthermore, we observe that neither the predicted surface hydrophobic residues nor residues that make up the predicted basic surface patch are critical for reconstitution of functional Elongin complexes in vitro. We did, however, identify three mutations, R29A, G33D/I34K/L35E/K36G, and Δ31–40, which fall within the ubiquitin-like domain and significantly reduce the interaction of Elongin B with Elongin C in vivo and in vitro. Notably, these mutations are confined to a short region in the COOH-terminal portion of predicted α-helix 1 and in the predicted turn between helix 1 and β-strand 3. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that these mutations affect the overall conformation of Elongin B, our results are consistent with the model that the COOH terminus of predicted α-helix 1 and the predicted turn between helix 1 and β-strand 3 may form a surface that interacts directly with Elongin C or may be important for maintaining Elongin B in a conformation that can interact with Elongin C. Two of the inactivating mutations, R29A and G33D/I34K/L35E/K36G, change Elongin B residues to the corresponding residues from ubiquitin. Sequence differences between Elongin B and ubiquitin in this region may be sufficient to account for the inability of ubiquitin to bind Elongin C, since eight additional ubiquitin-like mutations located throughout the ubiquitin-like domain had no significant effect on the interaction of Elongin B with Elongin C in cells.Finally, by characterizing Drosophila and C. elegans Elongin B homologs that efficiently replace mammalian Elongin B in reconstitution of the transcriptionally active Elongin ABC complex, we show that both the Elongin B ubiquitin-like domain and COOH-terminal tail have been highly conserved during evolution. Although we have not yet identified a function for the Elongin B tail, it is noteworthy that it includes a PXXP motif that is a potential target for binding by SH3 domain proteins (36Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Efforts to identify cellular proteins that interact with the Elongin B tail are underway. Elongin B is a subunit of the heterodimeric Elongin BC complex, which was originally identified as a positive regulator of RNA polymerase II elongation factor Elongin A (1Bradsher J.N. Jackson K.W.
