https://openalex.org/W2976024218,"When experts are immersed in a task, do their brains prioritize task-related activity? Most efforts to understand neural activity during well-learned tasks focus on cognitive computations and task-related movements. We wondered whether task-performing animals explore a broader movement landscape and how this impacts neural activity. We characterized movements using video and other sensors and measured neural activity using widefield and two-photon imaging. Cortex-wide activity was dominated by movements, especially uninstructed movements not required for the task. Some uninstructed movements were aligned to trial events. Accounting for them revealed that neurons with similar trial-averaged activity often reflected utterly different combinations of cognitive and movement variables. Other movements occurred idiosyncratically, accounting for trial-by-trial fluctuations that are often considered 'noise'. This held true throughout task-learning and for extracellular Neuropixels recordings that included subcortical areas. Our observations argue that animals execute expert decisions while performing richly varied, uninstructed movements that profoundly shape neural activity."
https://openalex.org/W2975507539,"The mammalian brain is complex, with multiple cell types performing a variety of diverse functions, but exactly how each cell type is affected in aging remains largely unknown. Here we performed a single-cell transcriptomic analysis of young and old mouse brains. We provide comprehensive datasets of aging-related genes, pathways and ligand-receptor interactions in nearly all brain cell types. Our analysis identified gene signatures that vary in a coordinated manner across cell types and gene sets that are regulated in a cell-type specific manner, even at times in opposite directions. These data reveal that aging, rather than inducing a universal program, drives a distinct transcriptional course in each cell population, and they highlight key molecular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, underlying brain aging. Overall, these large-scale datasets (accessible online at https://portals.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/aging-mouse-brain ) provide a resource for the neuroscience community that will facilitate additional discoveries directed towards understanding and modifying the aging process."

Using structural MRI data from 45,615 individuals aged 3-96 years, we demonstrate distinct patterns of apparent brain aging in several brain disorders and reveal genetic pleiotropy between apparent brain aging in healthy individuals and common brain disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2973473061,"In neurodegenerative diseases, debris of dead neurons are thought to trigger glia-mediated neuroinflammation, thus increasing neuronal death. Here we show that the expression of neurotoxic proteins associated with these diseases in microglia alone is sufficient to directly trigger death of naive neurons and to propagate neuronal death through activation of naive astrocytes to the A1 state. Injury propagation is mediated, in great part, by the release of fragmented and dysfunctional microglial mitochondria into the neuronal milieu. The amount of damaged mitochondria released from microglia relative to functional mitochondria and the consequent neuronal injury are determined by Fis1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation within the glial cells. The propagation of the inflammatory response and neuronal cell death by extracellular dysfunctional mitochondria suggests a potential new intervention for neurodegeneration-one that inhibits mitochondrial fragmentation in microglia, thus inhibiting the release of dysfunctional mitochondria into the extracellular milieu of the brain, without affecting the release of healthy neuroprotective mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2974880216,"Working memory involves storing and/or manipulating previously encoded information over a short-term delay period, which is typically followed by a behavioral response based on the remembered information. Although working memory tasks often engage dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, few studies have investigated whether their subprocesses are localized to different cortical depths in this region, and none have done so in humans. Here we use high-resolution functional MRI to interrogate the layer specificity of neural activity during different periods of a delayed-response task in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We detect activity time courses that follow the hypothesized patterns: namely, superficial layers are preferentially active during the delay period, specifically in trials requiring manipulation (rather than mere maintenance) of information held in working memory, and deeper layers are preferentially active during the response. Results demonstrate that layer-specific functional MRI can be used in higher-order brain regions to noninvasively map cognitive processing in humans. By developing layer-specific functional MRI techniques for a high-order cognitive brain area, Finn et al. dissociate activity in superficial and deeper cortical layers during different periods of a working memory task in human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex."

https://openalex.org/W2973590686,"Hundreds of genes are implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the mechanisms through which they contribute to ASD pathophysiology remain elusive. Here we analyzed leukocyte transcriptomics from 1- to 4-year-old male toddlers with ASD or typical development from the general population. We discovered a perturbed gene network that includes highly expressed genes during fetal brain development. This network is dysregulated in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuron models of ASD. High-confidence ASD risk genes emerge as upstream regulators of the network, and many risk genes may impact the network by modulating RAS–ERK, PI3K–AKT and WNT–β-catenin signaling pathways. We found that the degree of dysregulation in this network correlated with the severity of ASD symptoms in the toddlers. These results demonstrate how the heterogeneous genetics of ASD may dysregulate a core network to influence brain development at prenatal and very early postnatal ages and, thereby, the severity of later ASD symptoms. In leukocyte transcriptomes from toddlers with ASD, Gazestani et al. find a perturbed gene network that is involved in fetal brain development and lies downstream of ASD risk genes, and whose dysregulation level correlates with ASD symptom severity."
https://openalex.org/W2975734873,"Purpose NODDI is widely used in parameterizing microstructural brain properties. The model includes three signal compartments: intracellular, extracellular, and free water. The neurite compartment intrinsic parallel diffusivity (d∥) is set to 1.7 μm2⋅ms−1, though the effects of this assumption have not been extensively explored. This work investigates the optimality of d∥ = 1.7 μm2⋅ms−1 under varying imaging protocol, age groups, sex, and tissue type in comparison to other biologically plausible values of d∥. Methods Model residuals were used as the optimality criterion. The model residuals were evaluated in function of d∥ over the range from 0.5 to 3.0 μm2⋅ms−1. This was done with respect to tissue type (i.e., white matter versus gray matter), sex, age (infancy to late adulthood), and diffusion-weighting protocol (maximum b-value). Variation in the estimated parameters with respect to d∥ was also explored. Results Results show d∥ = 1.7 μm2⋅ms−1 is appropriate for adult brain white matter but it is suboptimal for gray matter with optimal values being significantly lower. d∥ = 1.7 μm2⋅ms−1 was also suboptimal in the infant brain for both white and gray matter with optimal values being significantly lower. Minor optimum d∥ differences were observed versus diffusion protocol. No significant sex effects were observed. Additionally, changes in d∥ resulted in significant changes to the estimated NODDI parameters. Conclusion The default (d∥) of 1.7 μm2⋅ms−1 is suboptimal in gray matter and infant brains."
https://openalex.org/W2976008201,"Ewing Sarcoma (ES) is characterized by recurrent translocations between EWSR1 and members of the ETS family of transcription factors. The transcriptional activity of the fusion oncoprotein is dependent on interaction with the nucleosome remodeling and deactylase (NuRD) co-repressor complex. While inhibitors of both histone deacetylase (HDAC) and lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) subunits of the NuRD complex demonstrate single agent activity in preclinical models, combination strategies have not been investigated. We selected 7 clinically utilized chemotherapy agents, or active metabolites thereof, for experimentation: doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, etoposide and irinotecan as well as the HDAC inhibitor romidepsin and the reversible LSD1 inhibitor SP2509. All agents were tested at clinically achievable concentrations in 4 ES cell lines. All possible 2 drug combinations were then tested for potential synergy. Order of addition of second-line conventional combination therapy agents was tested with the addition of SP2509. In two drug experiments, synergy was observed with several combinations, including when SP2509 was paired with topoisomerase inhibitors or romidepsin. Addition of SP2509 after treatment with second-line combination therapy agents enhanced treatment effect. Our findings suggest promising combination treatment strategies that utilize epigenetic agents in ES."
https://openalex.org/W2976037476,"Political scientists have long known that political involvement exacts costs but they have typically defined these costs in relatively narrow, largely economic terms. Though anecdotal evidence suggests that the costs of politics may in fact extend beyond economics to frayed personal relationships, compromised emotional stability, and even physical problems, no systematic evidence on these broader costs exists. We construct and validate batteries of survey items that delineate the physical, social, and emotional costs of political engagement and administer these items to a demographically representative sample of U.S. adults. The results suggest that a large number of Americans believe their physical health has been harmed by their exposure to politics and even more report that politics has resulted in emotional costs and lost friendships."
https://openalex.org/W2976867374,"Water deficiency up to a certain level and duration leads to a stress condition called drought. It is a multi-dimensional stress causing alteration in the physiological, morphological, biochemical, and molecular traits in plants resulting in improper plant growth and development. Drought is one of the major abiotic stresses responsible for loss of crops including muskmelon (Cucumis melo. L). Muskmelon genotype SC-15, which exhibits high drought resistance as reported in our earlier reports, was exposed to deficient water condition and studied for alteration in physiological, molecular and proteomic profile changes in the leaves. Drought stress results in reduced net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration (E) rate. With expanded severity of drought, declination recorded in content of total chlorophyll and carotenoid while enhancement observed in phenol content indicating generation of oxidative stress. In contrary, activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and guaiacol (POD) were increased under drought stress. Peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) showed that drought increased the relative abundance of 38 spots while decreases10 spots of protein. The identified proteins belong to protein synthesis, photosynthesis, nucleotide biosynthesis, stress response, transcription regulation, metabolism, energy and DNA binding. A drought-induced MADS-box transcription factor was identified. The present findings indicate that under drought muskmelon elevates the abundance of defense proteins and suppresses catabolic proteins. The data obtained exhibits possible mechanisms adopted by muskmelon to counter the impacts of drought induced stress."
https://openalex.org/W2977150865,"Mechanical stimulation appears to play a key role in cartilage homeostasis maintenance, but it can also contribute to osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence suggests that cartilage loading in the physiological range contributes to tissue integrity maintenance, whereas excessive or reduced loading have catabolic effects. However, how mechanical stimuli can regulate joint homeostasis is still not completely elucidated and few data are available on human cartilage. We aimed at investigating human OA cartilage response to ex vivo loading at physiological intensity. Cartilage explants from ten OA patients were subjected to ex vivo controlled compression, then recovered and used for gene and protein expression analysis of cartilage homeostasis markers. Compressed samples were compared to uncompressed ones in presence or without interleukin 1β (IL-1β) or interleukin 4 (IL-4). Cartilage explants compressed in combination with IL-4 treatment showed the best histological scores. Mechanical stimulation was able to significantly modify the expression of collagen type II (collagen 2), aggrecan, SOX9 transcription factor, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), collagen degradation marker C2C and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Conversely, ADAMTS4 metallopeptidase, interleukin 4 receptor alpha (IL4Rα), chondroitin sulfate 846 epitope (CS846), procollagen type 2 C-propeptide (CPII) and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) appeared not modulated. Our data suggest that physiological compression of OA human cartilage modulates the inflammatory milieu by differently affecting the expression of components and homeostasis regulators of the cartilage extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2976277847,"The transition to PEPFAR 2.0 with its focus on country ownership was accompanied by substantial funding cuts. We describe the impact of this transition on HIV care in a large network of HIV clinics in Nigeria. We surveyed 30 comprehensive HIV treatment clinics to assess services supported before (October 2013-September 2014) and after (October 2014-September 2015) the PEPFAR funding policy change, the impact of these policy changes on service delivery areas, and response of clinics to the change. We compared differences in support for staffing, laboratory services, and clinical operations pre- and post-policy change using paired t-tests. We used framework analysis to assess answers to open ended questions describing responses to the policy change. Most sites (83%, n = 25) completed the survey. The majority were public (60%, n = 15) and secondary (68%, n = 17) facilities. Clinics had a median of 989 patients in care (IQR: 543–3326). All clinics continued to receive support for first and second line antiretrovirals and CD4 testing after the policy change, while no clinics received support for other routine drug monitoring labs. We found statistically significant reductions in support for viral load testing, staff employment, defaulter tracking, and prevention services (92% vs. 64%, p = 0.02; 80% vs. 20%, 100% vs. 44%, 84% vs. 16%, respectively, p<0.01 for all) after the policy change. Service delivery was hampered by interrupted laboratory services and reduced wages and staff positions leading to reduced provider morale, and compromised quality of care. Almost all sites (96%) introduced user fees to address funding shortages. Clinics in Nigeria are experiencing major challenges in providing routine HIV services as a result of PEPFAR’s policy changes. Funding cutbacks have been associated with compromised quality of care, staff shortages, and reliance on fee-based care for historically free services. Sustainable HIV services funding models are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W2977074072,"Measures used to assess equitable relationship dynamics, including the sexual relationship power scale (SRPS) have previously been associated with lower HIV-risk among young women, and reduced perpetration of intimate partner violence among men. However, few studies describe how the SRPS has been adapted and validated for use within global youth sexual health studies. We examined gender-specific psychometric properties, reliability, and validity of a SRPS used within a South African youth-engaged cohort study.Young men and women (16-24 years) enrolled in community-based cohorts in Durban and Soweto (2014-2016) reporting a primary partner at 6-month follow-up completed a 13-item (strongly agree/agree/disagree/strongly disagree) South African adaptation of Pulerwitz's SRPS (range 13-52, higher scores indicating greater sexual relationship power [SRP] equity). SRPS modifications were made using gender-specific exploratory factor analyses (EFAs), removing items with factor loadings <0.3. Cronbach alphas were conducted for full and modified scales by gender. Using modified scales, unadjusted and adjusted regression models examined associations between 1. relevant socio-demographic and relationship determinants and SRP equity, and 2. SRP equity and sexual relationship related outcomes. All models adjusted for education, age, site, and current employment.235 sexually-active youth (66% women, median age = 20) were included. Mean scores across all 13 scale items were 2.71 (SD 0.30) for women and 2.70 (SD 0.4) for men. Scale Cronbach's alphas were 0.63 for women and 0.64 for men. EFAs resulted in two gender-specific single-factor SRPS. Modified SRPS Cronbach alphas increased to 0.67 for women (8-items) and 0.70 for men (9-items). After adjusting for age, site and current employment, higher education remained associated with SRP equity across genders. In adjusted models, correlates of SRP equity included primary partnerships that were age-similar (<5 years older) and <2 years in length for women and living in Soweto and younger age for men. Greater SRP equity among women was also independently associated with no recent partner violence.Results highlight important gender differences in SRP equity measures and associations, highlighting the critically need for future research to examine gendered constructions of SRP equity in order to accurately develop, validate and use appropriate measures within quantitative surveys."
https://openalex.org/W2975308984,"This study investigated the effect of open-placebo on cycling time-trial (TT) performance. Twenty-eight trained female cyclists completed a 1-km cycling TT following a control session or an open-placebo intervention. The intervention consisted of an individual presentation, provided by a medic, in which the concept of open-placebo was explained to the participant, before she ingested two red and white capsules containing flour; 15 min later, they performed the TT. In the control session, the participant sat quietly for 20 min. Heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were monitored throughout exercise, while blood lactate was determined pre- and post-exercise. Post-exercise questionnaires were employed to gain insight into the perceived influence of the supplement on performance. Open-placebo improved time-to-completion (P = 0.039, 103.6±5.0 vs. 104.4±5.1 s, -0.7±1.8 s, -0.7±1.7%) and mean power output (P = 0.01, 244.8±34.7 vs. 239.7±33.2, +5.1±9.5 W) during the TT. Individual data analysis showed that 11 individuals improved, 13 remained unchanged and 4 worsened their performance with open-placebo. Heart rate, RPE and blood lactate were not different between sessions (all P>0.05). Positive expectation did not appear necessary to induce performance improvements, suggesting unconscious processes occurred, although a lack of an improvement appeared to be associated with a lack of belief. Open-placebo improved 1-km cycling TT performance in trained female cyclists. Although the intervention was successful for some individuals, individual variation was high, and some athletes did not respond or even performed worse. Thus, open-placebo interventions should be carefully considered by coaches and practitioners, while further studies are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2975864406,"This study aimed to explore the relationship between dependence in Activities of Daily Living and muscle strength, muscle morphology and physical function in older nursing home residents, taking possible confounders into consideration.A total of 30 nursing home residents (age, 85.6±7.1 years) were included in this observational cross-sectional study. Performance of basic Activities of Daily Living (ADL) was assessed with the Resident Assessment Instrument and categorized as either independent or dependent. Isometric grip, quadriceps and elbow-flexor strength were determined by hand-dynamometry, muscle thickness and echo intensity by B-mode ultrasonography, a sit-to-stand task by using a stop watch and physical activity by the German-Physical-Activity Questionnaire. Degree of frailty was evaluated according to Fried's frailty criteria, whereas cognition, depression, incontinence, pain and falls were part of the Resident Assessment Instrument.Dependence in Activities of Daily Living was negatively correlated with physical activity (rs = -0.44, p = .015), handgrip (rs = -0.38, p = .038), elbow-flexor (rs = -0.42, p = .032) and quadriceps strength (rs = -0.67, p < .001), analysed by Spearman's correlation. Chronic diseases (rs = -0.41, p = .027) and incontinence (rs = -0.39, p = .037) were positively correlated with ADL while the other variables were not related. Only quadriceps strength remained significant with logistic regression (Wald(1) = 4.7, p = .03), when chronic diseases, quadriceps and handgrip strength were considered (R2 .79). 11 kg was the best fitting value in this sample to predict performance in Activities of Daily Living, evaluated with Receiver-Operating Characteristic analysis, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 79%.Quadriceps strength had a positive independent relationship with performance in ADL in the nursing home residents studied. Although a large prospective study is needed to verify the results, maintaining quadriceps strength above 11 kg may be helpful in retaining independence in this cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2975189713,"There are few studies describing Escherichia coli (E. coli) bloodstream infection (BSI) among children in Africa, yet E.coli is increasing in importance as a cause of antibiotic resistant infection in paediatric settings.In this retrospective, descriptive study aspects of E. coli BSI epidemiology are described over a 10-year period including incidence risk, risk factors for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli BSI, antibiotic susceptibility of the bacterial isolates and outcome including risk factors for severe disease.There were 583 new E. coli BSI episodes among 217,483 admissions, an overall incidence risk of 2.7 events/1,000 hospital admissions. Of 455 of these E. coli BSI episodes that were analysed, 136 (29.9%) were caused by ESBL-producing isolates. Risk factors for ESBL-producing E. coli BSI included hospitalization in the 28-day period preceding E. coli BSI episodes, having an underlying chronic illness other than HIV infection at the time of the E. coli BSI and having a temperature of 38° Celsius or higher at the time of the E. coli BSI. None of the E. coli isolates were resistant to carbapenems or colistin. The mortality rate was 5.9% and admission to the intensive care unit was required in 12.3% of BSI episodes. Predictors of severe disease included age less than 1 month, hospitalization in the 28-day period preceding E. coli BSI and BSI without a definable focus.These findings extend our understanding of E. coli BSI in a sub-Saharan African setting, provide useful information that can guide empiric treatment choices for community- and hospital-acquired BSI and help inform prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2976695948,"A microbiota is a complex ecosystem of microorganisms consisting of bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi living in different niches of the human body, which plays an essential role in many metabolic functions. Modifications in the microbiota composition can lead to several diseases, including metabolic disorders. The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of four viruses which can cause persistent infections–Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human papillomavirus (HPV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). Blood, saliva and oral swabs were collected from all the study participants. The nested-PCR technique was used to detect the viral DNA. DNA of at least one virus was detected in 71.1% of diabetic patients and in 30% of individuals without diabetes. In patients with diabetes EBV DNA was detected the most frequently (25.4%), followed by HPV– 19.1%, HSV– 10.4% and CMV– 5.2%. A higher percentage of EBV+HPV co-infection was found among men (30.8%). EBV DNA was statistically more often detected in patients living in rural areas (53.7%), while HPV (91.5%) and EBV+HPV co-infection (22.2%) prevailed among patients from urban areas. In patients with a DM2 history longer than 10 years viral infection was detected more frequently. The prevalence of EBV, HPV and the EBV+HPV co-infection was significantly higher in diabetic patients than in individuals without diabetes. The frequency of these infections depended on the duration of the disease (DM2)."
https://openalex.org/W2976496328,"Urine is an acceptable, non-invasive sample for investigating the human urogenital microbiota and for the diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections. However, low quantities of bacterial DNA and PCR inhibitors in urine may prevent efficient PCR amplification for molecular detection of bacteria. Furthermore, cold temperatures used to preserve DNA and bacteria in urine can promote precipitation of crystals that interfere with DNA extraction. Saline, Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline, or Tris-EDTA buffer were added to urine from adult men to determine if crystal precipitation could be reversed without heating samples beyond ambient temperature. Total bacterial DNA concentrations and PCR inhibition were measured using quantitative PCR assays to compare DNA yields with and without buffer addition. Dissolution of crystals with Tris-EDTA prior to urine centrifugation was most effective in increasing bacterial DNA recovery and reducing PCR inhibition. DNA recovery using Tris-EDTA was further tested by spiking urine with DNA from bacterial isolates and median concentrations of Lactobacillus jensenii and Escherichia coli 16S rRNA gene copies were found to be higher in urine processed with Tris-EDTA. Maximizing bacterial DNA yield from urine may facilitate more accurate assessment of bacterial populations and increase detection of specific bacteria in the genital tract."
https://openalex.org/W2964631694,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) disease reactivates from distant latent infection or recent (re)infection. Progression risks increase with age. Across the World Health Organisation Western Pacific region, many populations are ageing and have the highest per capita TB incidence rates in older age groups. However, methods for analysing age-specific TB incidence and forecasting epidemic trends while accounting for demographic change remain limited. Methods We applied the Lee-Carter models, which were originally developed for mortality modelling, to model the temporal trends in age-specific TB incidence data from 2005 to 2018 in Taiwan. Females and males were modelled separately. We combined our demographic forecasts, and age-specific TB incidence forecasts to project TB incidence until 2035. We compared TB incidence projections with demography fixed in 2018 to projections accounting for demographic change. Results Our models quantified increasing incidence rates with age and declining temporal trends. By 2035, the forecast suggests that the TB incidence rate in Taiwan will decrease by 54% (95% Prediction Interval (PI): 45%-59%) compared to 2015, while most age-specific incidence rates will reduce by more than 60%. In 2035, adults aged 65 and above will make up 78% of incident TB cases. Forecast TB incidence in 2035 accounting for demographic change will be 39% (95% PI: 36%-42%) higher than without population ageing. Conclusions Age-specific incidence forecasts coupled with demographic forecasts can inform the impact of population ageing on TB epidemics. The TB control programme in Taiwan should develop plans specific to older age groups and their care needs."

Microbial bioremediation is considered as the effective means of treating such contamination. This study describes a biosurfactant producing bacterium capable of utilizing crude oil and various hydrocarbons as the sole carbon source. Strain BU33N was isolated from hydrocarbon polluted sediments from the Bizerte coast (northern Tunisia) and was identified as Alcaligenes aquatilis on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. When grown on crude oil and phenanthrene as sole carbon and energy sources, isolate BU33N was able to degrade ~86%, ~56% and 70% of TERHc, n-alkanes and phenanthrene, respectively. The draft genome sequence of the A. aquatilis strain BU33N was assembled into one scaffold of 3,838,299 bp (G+C content of 56.1%). Annotation of the BU33N genome resulted in 3,506 protein-coding genes and 56 rRNA genes. A large repertoire of genes related to the metabolism of aromatic compounds including genes encoding enzymes involved in the complete degradation of benzoate were identified. Also genes associated with resistance to heavy metals such as copper tolerance and cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance were identified in BU33N. This work provides insight into the genomic basis of biodegradation capabilities and bioremediation/detoxification potential of A. aquatilis BU33N."
https://openalex.org/W2975003210,"Introduction HLA-incompatible (HLAi) and ABO-incompatible (ABOi) kidney transplantation (KT) has been on the increase over the last decade. However, there are wide variations in outcomes from these procedures. In this study we evaluated the graft and patient outcomes in incompatible KT and non-sensitized KT. Methods Patients who underwent KT between January 2012 and April 2018 were enrolled and reviewed. We divided kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) into five groups as follows: HLAi (n = 50); ABOi (n = 65); HLAi+ABOi (n = 5); control (n = 428); and living-donor control (LD control, n = 218). We compared the risk of rejection, graft function, graft survival, and patient survival between incompatible KTRs and control/LD control KTRs. Results Although the incidence of active antibody-mediated rejection in HLAi group tends to be higher than in control and LD control groups (6.0% vs. 2.8%, P = 0.20; 6.0% vs. 3.7%, P = 0.44, respectively), the rejection-free survival, graft survival, and patient survival were not significantly different from those of the control and LD control groups in all three incompatible KT groups (all P>0.05). Graft function during the study period was also not different between incompatible KTRs and control/LD control groups (both P>0.05). Using Cox regression analysis, neither HLAi nor ABOi were risk factors for graft failure. Some infectious diseases such as urinary tract infection and cytomegalovirus infection were more common in the HLAi group than in the control/LD control group (both P<0.05), but only one infection-related death occurred in HLAi KTRs. Infection risks were similar in the ABOi and HLAi+ABOi groups compared to controls. Conclusion Our results showed favorable outcomes for incompatible KT after desensitization. Although desensitization therapy for incompatible KT has improved access to transplantation for KT candidates with high immunological risk, more clinical data are clearly needed."
https://openalex.org/W2975685785,"Gastroenteritis (GE) and respiratory tract infection (RTI) outbreaks are a significant issue in nursing homes. This study aimed to describe GE and RTI outbreaks with infection and all-cause lethality rates according to the individual characteristics of nursing home residents.Clinical and virological surveillance were conducted (2007 to 2018). Virus stratifications for the analysis were: outbreaks with positive norovirus or influenza identifications (respectively NoV+ or Flu+), episodes with no NoV or influenza identification or testing (respectively NoV- or Flu-). Associations between individual variables (sex, age, length of stay (LOS), autonomy status) and infection and lethality rates were tested with univariate and Mantel-Haenszel (MH) methods.61 GE outbreaks and 76 RTI oubreaks (total 137 outbreaks) were recorded involving respectively 4309 and 5862 residents. In univariate analysis, higher infection rates and age were associated in NoV+, NoV-, and Flu+ contexts, and lower infection rates were associated with longer stays (NoV+ and NoV-). In MH stratified analysis (virus, sex (female/male)) adjusted for LOS (<4 or ≥4 years), the odds of being infected remained significant among older residents (≥86 years): NoV+/male (Odds ratio (ORMH): 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16-2.30) and Flu+/female and male (respectively ORMH: 1.50, CI: 1.27-1.79 and 1.73, CI: 1.28-2.33). In univariate analysis, lower autonomy status (NoV+, Flu+ and Flu-) and increased age (Flu+) were associated with higher lethality. In MH adjusted analysis, significant ORage adjusted for autonomy was: Flu+/ ≥86 years compared with <86 years, 1.97 (1.19-3.25) and ORautonomy adjusted for age for the more autonomous group (compared with the less autonomous group) was: Flu+, 0.41 (0.24-0.69); Flu-, 0.42 (0.20, 0.90).The residents of nursing homes are increasingly elderly and dependent. The specific infection and lethality risks according to these two factors indicate that surveillance and infection control measures are essential and of high priority."
https://openalex.org/W2975841838,"Neuronal defense against oxidative damage is mediated primarily by the glutathione redox system. Traditionally considered a mechanism to protect proteins from irreversible oxidation, mounting evidence supports a role for protein S-glutathionylation in cell signaling in response to changes in intracellular redox status. Here we determined the specific sites on the actin binding protein cofilin that undergo S-glutathionylation. In addition, we show that S-glutathionylation of cofilin reduces its capacity to depolymerize F-actin. We further describe an assay to determine the S-glutathionylation of target proteins in brain tissue from behaving rodents. Using this technique, we show that cofilin in the rat nucleus accumbens undergoes S-glutathionylation during 15-minutes of cued cocaine seeking in the absence of cocaine. Our findings demonstrate that cofilin S-glutathionylation is increased in response to cocaine-associated cues and that increased cofilin S-glutathionylation reduces cofilin-dependent depolymerization of F-actin.

Materials and methods Peripheral blood samples were collected from 108 BC patients before starting a new line of treatment (“baseline”), majority of whom had mBC (76/108; 70.4%). CTCs were retrieved by dean flow fractionation that enriched for larger cells, and enumerated using immunofluorescence-based staining. Progression-free survival (PFS) in mBC patients was analysed using Kaplan-Meier method; cox proportional hazard models were used for univariable and multivariable analyses. Results The detection rate of CTCs before starting a new line of treatment was 75.9% (n = 108; median: 8 CTCs/7.5 ml blood) at a cut off of ≥2 CTCs. PFS was inferior for mBC patients with baseline CTC count ≥5 CTCs/7.5 ml blood vs. those with < 5 CTCs/7.5 ml blood (median PFS: 4.3 vs. 7.0 months; p-value: 0.037). The prognostic relevance of CTCs was most significant in patients with HER2- mBC (median PFS: 4.1 vs. 8.3 months; p-value: 0.032), luminal (HR+HER2-) subtype (median PFS: 4.2 vs. 8.3 months; p-value: 0.048), and patients who had one or more prior treatments (median PFS: 4.2 vs. 7.0 months; p-value: 0.02). On multivariable analysis, baseline CTC level (hazard ratio (HR): 1.84, p-value: 0.02) and pre-treatment status (HR: 1.87, p-value: 0.05) were independent predictors of PFS. Conclusions This work demonstrates the prognostic significance of CTCs in mBC detected using a label-free size-based enrichment platform."

Mucosal immune activation, in the context of sexual transmission of HIV-1 infection, is crucial,
as the increased presence of activated T cells enhance susceptibility to infection. In this
regard, it has been proposed that immunomodulatory compounds capable of modulating
immune activation, such as Vitamin D (VitD) may reduce HIV-1 transmission and might be
used as a safe and cost-effective strategy for prevention. Considering this, we examined the
in vitro effect of the treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with the active
form of VitD, calcitriol, on cellular activation, function and susceptibility of CD4+ T cells to
HIV-1 infection.
Methods
We treated PBMCs from healthy HIV unexposed individuals (Co-HC) and frequently
exposed, HIV-1 seronegative individuals (HESNs) from Colombia and from healthy nonexposed
individuals from Canada (Ca-HC) with calcitriol and performed in vitro HIV-1 infection
assays using X4- and R5-tropic HIV-1 strains respectively. In addition, we evaluated the
activation and function of T cells and the expression of viral co-receptors, and select antiviral
genes following calcitriol treatment.
Results
Calcitriol reduced the frequency of infected CD4+ T cells and the number of viral particles
per cell, for both, X4- and R5-tropic viruses tested in the Co-HC and the Ca-HC, respectively,
but not in HESNs. Furthermore, in the Co-HC, calcitriol reduced the frequency of polyclonally
activated T cells expressing the activation markers HLA-DR and CD38, and those
HLA-DR+CD38-, whereas increased the subpopulation HLA-DR-CD38+. Calcitriol treatment also decreased production of granzyme, IL-2 and MIP-1β by T cells and increased the transcriptional
expression of the inhibitor of NF-kB and the antiviral genes cathelicidin (CAMP)
and APOBEC3G in PBMCs from Co-HC.
Conclusion
Our in vitro findings suggest that VitD treatment could reduce HIV-1 transmission through a
specific modulation of the activation levels and function of T cells, and the production of antiviral
factors. In conclusion, VitD remains as an interesting potential strategy to prevent HIV-
1 transmission that should be further explored."

Siglecs also recognize nonsialic acid ligands, many of which remain to be characterized. Here, we found that Siglec5 and Siglec14 recognize lipid compounds produced by Trichophyton, a fungal genus containing several pathogenic species. Biochemical approaches revealed that the Siglec ligands are fungal alkanes and triacylglycerols, an unexpected finding that prompted us to search for endogenous lipid ligands of Siglecs. Siglec5 weakly recognized several endogenous lipids, but the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin and the anti-inflammatory lipid 5-palmitic acid-hydroxystearic acid exhibited potent ligand activity on Siglec5. Further, the hydrophobic stretch in the Siglec5 N terminus region was found to be required for efficient recognition of these lipids. Notably, this hydrophobic stretch was dispensable for recognition of sialic acid. Siglec5 inhibited cell activation upon ligand binding, and accordingly, the lipophilic ligands suppressed interleukin-8 (IL-8) production in Siglec5-expressing human monocytic cells. Siglec14 and Siglec5 have high sequence identity in the extracellular region, and Siglec14 also recognized the endogenous lipids. However, unlike Siglec5, Siglec14 transduces activating signals upon ligand recognition. Indeed, the endogenous lipids induced IL-8 production in Siglec14-expressing human monocytic cells.

Pattern recognition receptors play crucial roles in the sensing of potential dangers, such as invading pathogens and altered self in innate immune cells (1Takeuchi O. Akira S.

However, other pattern recognition receptors also contribute to innate immune responses through interaction with specific ligands.

In humans, 14 Siglec members (Siglec1 to -16 except Siglec12 and -13) have been identified and are expressed mainly on hematopoietic cells in a cell type–specific manner. Innate immune cells predominantly express Siglec3, -5, -7, -9, and -14 (6Varki A. Angata T.

Siglec3, -5, -7, and -9 function as inhibitory receptors through their cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), which recruits phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2 and suppresses kinase-dependent activating signals (7Crocker P.R. Siglecs in innate immunity.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2005; 5 (15955740): 431-43710.1016/j.coph.2005.03.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Siglec14 lacks an ITIM but is associated with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing molecule DAP12 and transduces activating signals through Syk-family kinases, eventually activating transcription factors such as NFAT and NF-κB (8Angata T.

Siglec5 and -14 share most of the extracellular region, indicating partial gene conversion, and thus show similar binding preferences (8Angata T. Hayakawa T. Yamanaka M. Varki A. Nakamura M.

However, we have not found any evidence of an interaction of Siglecs with lipophilic ligands in the literature. In this study, we discovered lipophilic ligands of Siglec5 and -14 in fungi and mammalian cells. These lipophilic ligands interact with Siglec5 through a unique hydrophobic stretch, which differs from the sialic acid–binding site, and modulate cellular activation in innate immune cells. To detect potential ligand recognition activity of Siglecs, we generated Siglec reporter cells, in which GFP is expressed upon ligand binding. The cytoplasmic region of inhibitory Siglec receptor, which includes the ITIM sequence, was replaced with that of CD3ζ, which contains an ITAM sequence (Fig. S1A, left). FLAG-tagged Siglec-CD3ζ chimeric receptor was then transfected into NFAT-GFP reporter cells (2B4 T cell hybridoma) (25Ohtsuka M. Arase H. Takeuchi A. Yamasaki S. Shiina R. Suenaga T. Sakurai D.

We established four reporter cell lines for human Siglec3, -5, -7, and -9, which are expressed on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and monocytes (6Varki A. Angata T. Siglecs—the major subfamily of I-type lectins.Glycobiology. 2006; 16 (16014749): 1R-27R10.1093/glycob/cwj008Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). GFP expression by the Siglec reporter lines was confirmed by stimulation with plate-coated anti-FLAG antibody or the sialic acid–rich glycoprotein mucin (Fig. 1A).

Using the Siglec reporter lines, we carried out a screening for Siglec-binding pathogens in a pathogenic fungi library and found that Siglec5 recognized several pathogenic fungi. Among them, Trichophyton spp., including Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton tonsrans showed potential ligand activity (Fig. 1B). Siglec3 and -9 weakly recognized Trichophyton spp. Human Siglec14 and -5 have high sequence identity in the N-terminal extracellular region (Fig. 1C) and thus have similar ligand preference (8Angata T. Hayakawa T. Yamanaka M. Varki A. Nakamura M. Discovery of Siglec-14, a novel sialic acid receptor undergoing concerted evolution with Siglec-5 in primates.FASEB J. 2006; 20 (17012248): 1964-197310.1096/fj.06-5800comCrossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Siglec14 lacks the ITIM sequence but instead associates with ITAM adaptor molecule DAP12 and transduces activating signals upon ligand binding. To determine whether Siglec14 also recognizes the above pathogenic fungi, we generated Siglec14 reporter cells by introducing Siglec14 and DAP12 into NFAT-GFP reporter cells (Fig. S1B). Anti-FLAG antibody and mucin effectively induced GFP expression in Siglec14 reporter cells (Fig. 1A). As expected, Siglec14 recognized Trichophyton spp. as potently as Siglec5 (Fig. 1B). We confirmed the direct interaction between Siglecs and Trichophyton spp. by using recombinant Siglec-Fc fusion proteins in which the extracellular region of Siglec was fused with the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of human IgG1 (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these results suggested that Siglec5 and -14 recognize T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, and T. tonsrans. We next aimed to identify the ligands of Siglec5 in Trichophyton spp. A previous study demonstrated that T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes lack sialic acids (28Esquenazi D. Rozental S. Alviano C.S. Travassos L.R. Schauer R. Sialic acids are absent from the dermatophytes Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum.Mycoses. 2003; 46 (12801362): 197-20210.1046/j.1439-0507.2003.00873.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Consistently, sialidase or N-glycosidase treatment had no impact on the ligand activity of Trichophyton spp. (Fig. 2A). Siglec5 and -14 reportedly recognize proteinaceous ligands in a sialic acid–independent manner (21Carlin A.F. Chang Y.C. Areschoug T. Lindahl G. Hurtado-Ziola N. King C.C. Varki A. Nizet V.

However, ligand activity was still observed upon proteinase K treatment or heat denaturation (Fig. 2A). These results strongly suggested that Trichophyton spp. have previously unknown ligands. We therefore tried to purify these ligands using biochemical approaches. Trichophyton spp. were treated with organic solvent (CHCl3/MeOH, 2:1 (v/v)) and separated the lipophilic extract and delipidized fungal biomass. Ligand activity was dominantly observed in the lipophilic extract (Fig. 2B). As we did not find any reports on lipophilic ligands of Siglec5 in the previous literature, we further purified the ligands in the lipophilic extract of T. mentagrophytes. The lipophilic extract was separated in hexane-soluble and -insoluble fractions; the hexane-soluble fraction potently activated Siglec5 reporter cells (Fig. 2C). The hexane-soluble fraction was further separated into six subfractions by high-performance TLC (HPTLC). Fractions 4 and 6 showed strong ligand activity and clear spots upon iodide staining (Fig. 2D). To determine the chemical structures of the compounds present in Fractions 4 and 6, we used NMR and high-resolution electrospray ionization TOF MS (ESI-TOF-MS) analyses. The 1H NMR spectrum of Fraction 4 showed proton signals characteristic of triacylglycerol (TAG), and ESI-TOF-MS spectrum showed molecular-related ion peaks at m/z 853.7290, 877.7294, 881.7610, 901.7289, and 905.7587 (Fig. 2E). Next, we determined the fatty acid composition by GC-MS following methanolysis. The GC-MS chromatogram of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) revealed the presence of C16:0, C18:1, C18:2, and C18:0 FAMEs (Fig. S2A). The structures of the TAGs identified in Fraction 4 were shown in Fig. S2B. The compounds present in Fraction 6 were elucidated by 1H NMR and GC-MS analysis. The 1H NMR spectrum of Fraction 6 showed proton signals characteristic of saturated alkane, and GC-MS revealed molecular ion peaks assigned to a mixture of saturated alkanes consisting of C14H30 to C21H44 (Fig. 2F and Fig. S2 (C and D)). Chemically synthesized saturated alkane (C16) and TAG (C18:2) coated in 96-well plates activated both Siglec5 and Siglec14 reporter cells (Fig. 2G). To confirm the direct interaction between Siglecs and lipophilic ligands, we carried out an ELISA-based binding assay using recombinant Siglec-Fc fusion proteins. Siglec5-Fc and Siglec14-Fc substantially bound to plate-coated synthetic alkane and TAG (Fig. 2H). Taken together, these data indicated that alkane and TAG are novel lipophilic ligands of Siglec5 and -14. To investigate the structure–activity relationship of alkanes and Siglec5, we first compared the ligand activity of saturated alkanes of different lengths. Long-chain alkanes (C14–C22) activated Siglec5 reporter cells, whereas short-chain alkanes (C8–C12) did not, suggesting that a certain length is required for ligand activity (Fig. 3A). Next, we examined the effect of alkane end-group modification on ligand activity (Fig. S3A). Siglec5 recognized alkane derivatives with one end modification, including 1-octadecanol and 1-bromooctadecane (Fig. 3B). Octadecanedioic acid, which contains hydroxyl groups at both ends, still activated Siglec5 reporter cells, suggesting that end-group modification does not interfere with the ligand activity of alkanes. GFP expression was reduced upon high-dose treatment with 1-octadecanol and octadecanedioic acid because of cytotoxicity. Cyclo-pentadecane and linear pentadecane showed similar ligand activity (Fig. 3C). Squalane, which is multiple methyl-branched tetracosane, also activated Siglec reporter cells (Fig. 3D and Fig. S3B). These results suggested that Siglec5 can broadly recognize alkanes of a certain length. Next, we analyzed the ligand activity of TAGs and related glycerolipids. Comparison of TAGs with unsaturated or saturated C18 fatty acid chains (Fig. S3C) revealed that C18:3 TAG activated Siglec5 reporter cells the most potently, although all TAGs showed ligand activity (Fig. 4A). TAGs consist of glycerol and three fatty acid chains. Consistent with the above finding that Siglec5 recognized alkane derivatives with end modification, fatty acids, but not glycerol, activated Siglec5 reporter cells (Fig. 4B). Both diacylglycerol (DAG) and monoacylglycerol (MAG) (Fig. S3D) also showed ligand activity, suggesting that the presence of multiple alkyl chains is not required for ligand activity (Fig. 4C). Stearic acid and MAG potently activated Siglec5 reporter cells; however, they also showed strong cytotoxicity. Our unexpected finding that Siglec5 recognized lipophilic ligands prompted us to further investigate the ligand activity of other endogenous lipids. Glycerophospholipids, which are major components of the mammalian cell membrane, are synthesized from cytidine diphosphate-DAG and thus share a common structure with DAG. Siglec5 reporter cells were activated by phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), but not by other glycerophospholipids, suggesting that polar headgroups may affect ligand activity (Fig. 4D). Cardiolipin, which is abundantly found in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is synthesized from PG and cytidine diphosphate-DAG, potently activated Siglec5 reporter cells (Fig. 4E). Like glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids contain long alkyl chains and are widely distributed in the cell membrane. Sphingomyelin and C16 ceramide failed to activate Siglec5 reporter cells (Fig. 4F). Cholesterol is another major lipid component in the cell membrane, with a sterol structure and a short alkyl chain. Most ingested cholesterol is esterified with long-chain fatty acids and stored in lipid droplets along with TAG. Siglec5 recognized cholesterol and cholesterol ester (Fig. 4G). Palmitic acid hydroxystearic acids (PAHSAs) are branched fatty acid esters with anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic activities (29Yore M.M. Syed I. Moraes-Vieira P.M. Zhang T. Herman M.A. Homan E.A. Patel R.T. Lee J. Chen S. Peroni O.D. Dhaneshwar A.S. Hammarstedt A. Smith U. McGraw T.E. Saghatelian A. Kahn B.B.

Taken together, these data indicated that Siglec5 recognizes several endogenous lipids. Because cardiolipin and 5-PAHSA were particularly potent ligands of Siglec5, they were studied in detail in further experiments. Direct interaction between Siglec5 and cardiolipin/5-PAHSA was confirmed by an ELISA-based binding assay (Fig. 4I). We next investigated the binding site in Siglec5 for lipid ligand recognition. Siglec5 contains four putative Ig-like domains, referred to as the V-set domain, and three C2-set domains (7Crocker P.R. Siglecs in innate immunity.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2005; 5 (15955740): 431-43710.1016/j.coph.2005.03.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). Siglec14 shares the V-set domain and the first C2-set domain with Siglec5, except one amino acid residue positioned at 215 (Met in Siglec5 and Val in Siglec14) (8Angata T. Hayakawa T. Yamanaka M. Varki A. Nakamura M. Discovery of Siglec-14, a novel sialic acid receptor undergoing concerted evolution with Siglec-5 in primates.FASEB J. 2006; 20 (17012248): 1964-197310.1096/fj.06-5800comCrossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). Both cardiolipin and 5-PAHSA also activated Siglec14 reporter cells (Fig. 5A), indicating that the V-set and/or first C2-set domains mediate lipid ligand recognition. To clarify which domain is required for the recognition of lipid ligands, we generated Siglec5 reporter cells lacking the V-set domain in the N terminus (Fig. 5B, Δ17–145). This deletion mutant completely lost recognition activity toward cardiolipin and 5-PAHSA, indicating that the V-set domain is necessary to recognize these lipid ligands (Fig. 5C, black columns). To further narrow down the ligand-binding site in the V-set domain, we generated an additional deletion mutant lacking approximately half of the N-terminal region of the V-set domain (Fig. 5B, Δ17–83). This mutant showed compromised responses against lipid ligands (Fig. 5C, gray columns). Thus, the N-terminal region of the V-set domain (amino acids 17–83) is required for efficient recognition of lipid ligands. Several receptors bind to lipophilic ligands through a hydrophobic binding pocket (30Zeng Z. Castaño A.R. Segelke B.W. Stura E.A. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Crystal structure of mouse CD1: An MHC-like fold with a large hydrophobic binding groove.Science. 1997; 277 (9219685): 339-34510.1126/science.277.5324.339Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 31Furukawa A.

https://openalex.org/W2976849067,"Context High rates of burnout have been reported in low and medium income countries and can detrimentally impact healthcare delivery. Understanding factors associated with burnout amongst health care workers providing HIV care may help develop interventions to prevent/treat burnout. Objectives We sought to understand factors associated with burnout amongst health care workers providing HIV care in Malawi. Methods This was a sub-study of a larger cross-sectional study measuring burnout prevalence amongst a convenience sample of healthcare workers providing HIV care in 89 health facilities in eight districts in Malawi. Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Anonymously administered surveys included questions about sociodemographics, work characteristics (work load, supervisor support, team interactions), depression, life stressors, assessment of type D personality, and career satisfaction. We performed univariable and multivariable regression analyses to explore associations between variables and burnout. Results We received 535 responses (response rate 99%). Factors associated with higher rates of burnout on multivariable regression analyses included individual level factors: male gender (OR 1.75 [CI 1.17, 2.63]; p = 0.007), marital status (widowed or divorced) (OR 3.24 [CI 1.32, 7.98]; p = 0.011), depression (OR 3.32 [CI 1.21, 9.10]; p = 0.020), type D personality type (OR 2.77 [CI 1.50, 5.12]; p = 0.001) as well as work related factors: working at a health center vs. a rural hospital (OR 2.02 [CI 1.19, 3.40]; p = 0.009); lack of a very supportive supervisor (OR 2.38 [CI 1.32, 4.29]; p = 0.004), dissatisfaction with work/team interaction (OR 1.76 [CI 1.17, 2.66]; p = 0.007), and career dissatisfaction (OR 0.76 [CI 0.60, 0.96]; p = 0.020). Conclusion This study identified several individual level vulnerabilities as well as work related modifiable factors. Improving the supervisory capacity of health facility managers and creating conditions for improved team dynamics may help reduce burnout amongst healthcare workers proving HIV care in Malawi."
https://openalex.org/W2976514296,"Absolute pitch (AP), the rare ability to name any musical note without the aid of a reference note, is thought to depend on an early critical period of development. Although recent research has shown that adults can improve AP performance in a single training session, the best learners still did not achieve note classification levels comparable to performance of a typical, ""genuine"" AP possessor. Here, we demonstrate that these ""genuine"" levels of AP performance can be achieved within eight weeks of training for at least some adults, with the best learner passing all measures of AP ability after training and retaining this knowledge for at least four months after training. Alternative explanations of these positive results, such as improving accuracy through adopting a slower, relative pitch strategy, are not supported based on joint analyses of response time and accuracy. The results also did not appear to be driven by extreme familiarity with a single instrument or octave range, as the post-training AP assessments used eight different timbres and spanned over seven octaves. Yet, it is also important to note that a majority of the participants only exhibited modest improvements in performance, suggesting that adult AP learning is difficult and that near-perfect levels of AP may only be achievable by subset of adults. Overall, these results demonstrate that explicit perceptual training in some adults can lead to AP performance that is behaviorally indistinguishable from AP that manifests within a critical period of development. Implications for theories of AP acquisition are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2977164724,"The Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa) is increasingly considered as a relevant actor in the epidemiology of animal tuberculosis (TB). Therefore, monitoring TB in this species is key when establishing comprehensive control schemes for this disease still present in Europe. No data are available on direct and indirect TB diagnostic methods in wild boars in epidemiological contexts where TB is endemic in cattle and detected in wild boars at low prevalence. We aimed to estimate and compare sensitivity and specificity values for bacterial culture, PCR and three commercial ELISAs, i.e. the TB ELISA-VK (using the bPPD antigen), INgezim TB Porcine and IDEXX M. bovis Ab Test (both using the MPB83 and MPB70 antigens), under field conditions in France. We used frequentist methods, with bacteriology as the gold standard, and a Bayesian formulation of the latent class analysis (LCA), without using a gold standard. Submandibular lymph nodes and sera from 495 wild boars hunter-harvested in three endemic areas (Aquitaine region, Côte d'Or region, and Corsica region) were collected between 2014 and 2016. Only eight individuals were positive for M. bovis by bacteriology (1.61%; CI95% 0.70-3.51%). The LCA method provided high specificities (99.2%; CI95% 98.2-99.8% for INgezim TB Porcine and 99.7%; CI95% 98.8-100% for IDEXX M. bovis Ab Test) and sensitivities (78.5%; CI95% 65.1-88.8% for INgezim TB Porcine and 83.9%; CI95% 58.9-97.2% for IDEXX M. bovis Ab Test) for both ELISAs using the MPB83 and MPB70 antigens. Bacterial culture showed limited sensitivity (42.8%; CI95% 19.0-70.6%), estimated as the probability of a positive result in an animal exposed to M. bovis. PCR and ELISA using the bPPD antigens demonstrated high specificities, and sensitivities intermediates between culture and the ELISAs using the MPB83 and MPB70 antigens. These results suggest that ELISA tests using the MPB83 and MPB70 antigens are useful to detect and monitor TB exposure of wild boar populations in field conditions in France."

A retrospective cohort study involving 855,297 people was conducted. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis fitted the multiple pollutant models for two targeted pollutants, including total hydrocarbons (THC), nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC) were used, and the risk of RVO was estimated. The chi-squared test and one-way analysis of variance were used to test differences in demographics and comorbidity distribution among tertiles of the targeted pollutants. Before controlling for multiple pollutants, hazard ratios for the overall population were 19.88 (95% CI: 17.56–22.50) at 0.51-ppm increases in THC and 4.33 (95% CI: 3.97–4.73) at 0.27-ppm increases in NMHC. The highest adjusted hazard ratios for different multiple pollutant models of each targeted pollutant were statistically significant (all p values were ≤0.05) for all patients at 29.67 (95% CI: 25.57–34.42) for THC and 16.24 (95% CI: 14.14–18.65) for NMHC.

https://openalex.org/W2975130279,"The equine hoof inner epithelium is folded into primary and secondary epidermal lamellae which increase the dermo-epidermal junction surface area of the hoof and can be affected by laminitis, a common disease of equids. Two keratin proteins (K), K42 and K124, are the most abundant keratins in the hoof lamellar tissue of Equus caballus. We hypothesize that these keratins are lamellar tissue-specific and could serve as differentiation- and disease-specific markers. Our objective was to characterize the expression of K42 and K124 in equine stratified epithelia and to generate monoclonal antibodies against K42 and K124. By RT-PCR analysis, keratin gene (KRT) KRT42 and KRT124 expression was present in lamellar tissue, but not cornea, haired skin, or hoof coronet. In situ hybridization studies showed that KRT124 localized to the suprabasal and, to a lesser extent, basal cells of the lamellae, was absent from haired skin and hoof coronet, and abruptly transitions from KRT124-negative coronet to KRT124-positive proximal lamellae. A monoclonal antibody generated against full-length recombinant equine K42 detected a lamellar keratin of the appropriate size, but also cross-reacted with other epidermal keratins. Three monoclonal antibodies generated against N- and C-terminal K124 peptides detected a band of the appropriate size in lamellar tissue and did not cross-react with proteins from haired skin, corneal limbus, hoof coronet, tongue, glabrous skin, oral mucosa, or chestnut on immunoblots. K124 localized to lamellar cells by indirect immunofluorescence. This is the first study to demonstrate the localization and expression of a hoof lamellar-specific keratin, K124, and to validate anti-K124 monoclonal antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2975184792,"Objective An infectious disease outbreak such as the 2009 influenza pandemic is an unexpected demand shock to hospital emergency departments (EDs). We analysed changes in key performance metrics in (EDs) in Victoria during this pandemic to assess the impact of this demand shock. Design and setting Descriptive time-series analysis and longitudinal regression analysis of data from the Victorian Emergency Minimum Dataset (VEMD) using data from the 38 EDs that submit data to the state’s Department of Health and Human Services. Main outcome measures Daily number of presentations, influenza-like-illness (ILI) presentations, daily mean waiting time (time to first being seen by a doctor), daily number of patients who did-not-wait and daily number of access-blocked patients (admitted patients with length of stay >8 hours) at a system and hospital-level. Results During the influenza pandemic, mean waiting time increased by up to 25%, access block increased by 32% and did not wait presentations increased by 69% above pre-pandemic levels. The peaks of all three crowding variables corresponded approximately to the peak in admitted ILI presentations. Longitudinal fixed-effects regression analysis estimated positive and statistically significant associations between mean waiting times, did not wait presentations and access block and ILI presentations. Conclusions This pandemic event caused excess demand leading to increased waiting times, did-not-wait patients and access block. Increases in admitted patients were more strongly associated with crowding than non-admitted patients during the pandemic period, so policies to divert or mitigate low-complexity non-admitted patients are unlikely to be effective in reducing ED crowding."
https://openalex.org/W2976206429,"Seabirds are well known to be attracted by fishing boats to forage on offal and baits. We used recently developed loggers that record accurate GPS position and detect the presence of boats through their radar emissions to examine how albatrosses use Area Restricted Search (ARS) and if so, have specific ARS behaviours, when attending boats. As much as 78.5% of locations with a radar detection (contact with boat) during a trip occurred within ARS: 36.8% of all large-scale ARS (n = 212) and 14.7% of all small-scale ARS (n = 1476) were associated with the presence of a boat. During small-scale ARS, birds spent more time and had greater sinuosity during boat-associated ARS compared with other ARS that we considered natural. For, small-scale ARS associated with boats, those performed over shelves were longer in duration, had greater sinuosity, and birds spent more time sitting on water compared with oceanic ARS associated with boats. We also found that the proportion of small-scale ARS tend to be more frequently nested in larger-scale ARS was higher for birds associated with boats and that ARS behaviour differed between oceanic (tuna fisheries) and shelf-edge (mainly Patagonian toothfish fisheries) habitats. We suggest that, in seabird species attracted by boats, a significant amount of ARS behaviours are associated with boats, and that it is important to be able to separate ARS behaviours associated to boats from natural searching behaviours. Our study suggest that studying ARS characteristics should help attribute specific behaviours associated to the presence of boats and understand associated risks between fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W2977202771,"Noise is a major challenge for the analysis of fMRI data in general and for connectivity analyses in particular. As researchers develop increasingly sophisticated tools to model statistical dependence between the fMRI signal in different brain regions, there is a risk that these models may increasingly capture artifactual relationships between regions, that are the result of noise. Thus, choosing optimal denoising methods is a crucial step to maximize the accuracy and reproducibility of connectivity models. Most comparisons between denoising methods require knowledge of the ground truth: of what is the ‘real signal’. For this reason, they are usually based on simulated fMRI data. However, simulated data may not match the statistical properties of real data, limiting the generalizability of the conclusions. In this article, we propose an approach to evaluate denoising methods using real (non-simulated) fMRI data. First, we introduce an intersubject version of multivariate pattern dependence (iMVPD) that computes the statistical dependence between a brain region in one participant, and another brain region in a different participant. iMVPD has the following advantages: 1) it is multivariate, 2) it trains and tests models on independent partitions of the real fMRI data, and 3) it generates predictions that are both between subjects and between regions. Since whole-brain sources of noise are more strongly correlated within subject than between subjects, we can use the difference between standard MVPD and iMVPD as a ‘discrepancy metric’ to evaluate denoising techniques (where more effective techniques should yield smaller differences). As predicted, the difference is the greatest in the absence of denoising methods. Furthermore, a combination of removal of the global signal and CompCorr optimizes denoising (among the set of denoising options tested)."

We aimed to investigate the effect of fear of movement-related pain (FMRP) and contextual pain related anxiety (CPRA) on the magnitude of placebo analgesia induced by verbal suggestion. Fifty-six female participants completed a modified voluntary joystick movement paradigm (VJMP) where half participated in a predictable pain condition (PC), in which one of the joystick movements is always followed by pain and the other movement is never followed by pain, and half in an unpredictable pain condition (UC), in which pain was delivered unpredictably. By varying the level of pain predictability, FMRP and CPRA were induced in PC and UC respectively. Colour stimuli were presented at the beginning of each trail. Half of the participants were verbally informed that the green or red colour indicated less painful stimuli (experimental groups), the other half did not receive any suggestion (control groups). We measured self-reported pain intensity, expectancy of pain intensity (PC only), pain related fear and anxiety (eyeblink startle response and self-ratings) and avoidance behaviour (movement-onset latency and duration). The results indicate that the placebo effect was successfully induced in both experimental conditions. In the PC, the placebo effect was predicted by expectancy. Despite the fact that FMRP and CPRA were successfully induced, no difference was found in the magnitude of the placebo effect between PC and UC. Concluding, we did not find a divergent effect of fear and anxiety on placebo analgesia."
https://openalex.org/W2975843860,"Background Pleural fluid homocysteine (HCY) can be useful for diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion (MPE). There are no published studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of HCY with other tumour markers in pleural fluid for diagnosis of MPE. The aim was to compare the accuracy of HCY with that of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA) 15.3, CA19.9 and CA125 in pleural fluid and to develop a probabilistic model using these biomarkers to differentiate benign (BPE) from MPE. Methods Patients with pleural effusion were randomly included. HCY, CEA, CA15.3, CEA19.9 and CA125 were quantified in pleural fluid. Patients were classified into two groups: MPE or BPE. By applying logistic regression analysis, a multivariate probabilistic model was developed using pleural fluid biomarkers. The diagnostic accuracy was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Results Population of study comprised 133 patients (72 males and 61 females) aged between 1 and 96 years (median = 70 years), 81 BPE and 52 MPE. The logistic regression analysis included HCY (p<0.0001) and CEA (p = 0.0022) in the probabilistic model and excluded the other tumour markers. The probabilistic model was: HCY+CEA = Probability(%) = 100×(1+e-z)-1, where Z = 0.5471×[HCY]+0.3846×[CEA]–8.2671. The AUCs were 0.606, 0.703, 0.778, 0.800, 0.846 and 0.948 for CA125, CA19.9, CEA, CA15.3, HCY and HCY+CEA, respectively. Conclusions Pleural fluid HCY has higher accuracy for diagnosis of MPE than CEA, CA15.3, CA19.9 and CA125. The combination of HCY and CEA concentrations in pleural fluid significantly improves the diagnostic accuracy of the test."

To study individuals with an intensive, longitudinal study design that requires repetitive sampling in their daily life, non-invasive sampling techniques are a necessity. Urine can be collected in a non-invasive way, but this may be demanding for participants and little is known about fluctuation of inflammatory markers in urine over time. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of non-invasive sampling, and to explore intra-individual differences in inflammatory markers in urine. Materials & methods Ten healthy individuals collected 24-hour urine for 63 consecutive days. In a pilot analysis, 39 inflammatory markers were examined for detectability in urine, stability over time and under storage conditions, and daily fluctuations. Multiplex analyses were used to quantify levels of eight selected markers: C-reactive protein (CRP), Fractalkine, Interleukin-1 receptor-antagonist (IL-1RA), interferon-α (IFNα), interferon-γ (IFNγ), Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP10), Macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). Cross-correlations were calculated between the overnight and 24-hour samples were calculated, to examine whether 24-hour urine could be replaced by the overnight portion for better feasibility. We examined intra- and interindividual differences in the levels of inflammatory markers in urine and the fluctuations thereof. Results This study showed that levels of selected inflammatory markers can be detected in urine. Cross-correlation analyses showed that correlations between levels of inflammatory markers in the night portion and the 24-hour urine sample varied widely between individuals. In addition, analyses of time series revealed striking inter- and intra-individual variation in levels of inflammatory markers and their fluctuations. Conclusion We show that the assessment of urinary inflammatory markers is feasible in an intensive day-to-day study in healthy individuals. However, 24-hour urine cannot be replaced by an overnight portion to alleviate the protocol burden. Levels of inflammatory markers show substantial variation between and within persons."

Among the thousands of human ENaC variants, only a few exist whose functional consequences have been experimentally tested. Here, we used the Xenopus oocyte expression system to investigate the functional roles of four nonsynonymous human ENaC variants located within the β7-strand and its adjacent loop of the α-subunit extracellular β-ball domain. αR350Wβγ and αG355Rβγ channels exhibited 2.5- and 1.8-fold greater amiloride-sensitive currents than WT αβγ human ENaCs, respectively, whereas αV351Aβγ channels conducted significantly less current than WT. Currents in αH354Rβγ-expressing oocytes were similar to those expressing WT. Surface expression levels of three mutants (αR350Wβγ, αV351Aβγ, and αG355Rβγ) were similar to that of WT. However, three mutant channels (αR350Wβγ, αH354Rβγ, and αG355Rβγ) exhibited a reduced Na+ self-inhibition response. Open probability of αR350Wβγ was significantly greater than that of WT. Moreover, other Arg-350 variants, including αR350G, αR350L, and αR350Q, also had significantly increased channel activity. A direct comparison of αR350W and two previously reported gain–of–function variants revealed that αR350W increases ENaC activity similarly to αW493R, but to a much greater degree than does αC479R. Our results indicate that αR350W along with αR350G, αR350L, and αR350Q, and αG355R are novel gain–of–function variants that function as gating modifiers. The location of these multiple functional variants suggests that the αENaC β-ball domain portion that interfaces with the palm domain of βENaC critically regulates ENaC gating."

The level of plasma insulin was significantly reduced in 1-triple TTA-treated rats, resulting in a 32% reduction in the insulin/glucose ratio. The hepatic glucose and glycogen levels were lowered by 22% and 49%, respectively, compared to control. This was accompanied by lower hepatic gene expression of phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, and Hnf4A, a regulator of gluconeogenesis. Gene expression of pyruvate kinase, catalysing the final step of glycolysis, was also reduced by 1-triple TTA. In addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was reduced, accompanied by 10-15-fold increased gene expression of its regulator pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 compared to control, suggesting reduced entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. Indeed, the NADPH-generating enzyme malic enzyme 1 (ME1) catalysing production of pyruvate from malate, was increased 13-fold at the gene expression level. Despite the decreased glycogen level, genes involved in glycogen synthesis were not affected in livers of 1-triple TTA treated rats. In contrast, the pentose phosphate pathway seemed to be increased as the hepatic gene expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was higher in 1-triple TTA treated rats compared to controls. In human Huh7 liver cells, but not in myotubes, 1-triple-TTA reduced glucose oxidation and induced fatty acid oxidation, in line with previous observations of increased hepatic mitochondrial palmitoyl-CoA oxidation in rats. Importantly, this work recognizes the liver as an important organ in glucose homeostasis. The mitochondrially targeted fatty acid analogue 1-triple TTA seemed to lower hepatic glucose and glycogen levels by inhibition of gluconeogenesis. This was also linked to a reduction in glucose oxidation accompanied by reduced PHD activity and stimulation of ME1 and G6PD, favouring a shift from glucose- to fatty acid oxidation. The reduced plasma insulin/glucose ratio indicate that 1-triple TTA may improve glucose tolerance in rats."

They are not completely synthesized during DNA replication and are elongated by specific mechanisms. The structure of the telomeres and the elongation mechanism have not been determined in Dictyostelium discoideum. This organism presents extrachromosomal palindromic elements containing two copies of the rDNA, also present at the end of the chromosomes. In this article the structure of the terminal region of the rDNA is shown to consist of repetitions of the A(G)n sequence where the number of Gs is variable. These repeats extend as a 3’ single stranded region. The G-rich region is preceded by four tandem repetitions of two different DNA motifs. D. discoideum telomere reverse transcriptase homologous protein (TERTHP) presented RNase-sensitive enzymatic activity and was required to maintain telomere structure since terthp-mutant strains presented reorganizations of the DNA terminal regions. These modifications were different in several terthp-mutants and changed with their prolonged culture and subcloning. However, the terthp gene is not essential for D. discoideum proliferation. Telomeres could be maintained in terthp-mutant strains by homologous recombination mechanisms such as ALT (Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres) or HAATI (heterochromatin amplification-mediated and telomerase-independent). In agreement with this hypothesis, the expression of mRNAs coding for several proteins involved in homologous recombination was induced in terthp-mutant strains. Extrachromosomal rDNA could serve as substrate in these DNA homologous recombination reactions."

However, a few pansy germplasms with improved heat tolerance have been discovered or bred, but the mechanisms of their heat resistance are not understood. In this study, we investigated the transcript profiles of a heat-tolerant pansy inbred line, DFM16, in response to high temperatures using RNAseq. Approximately 55.48 Gb of nucleotide data were obtained and assembled into 167,576 unigenes with an average length of 959 bp, of which, 5,708 genes were found to be differentially expressed after heat treatments. Real-time qPCR was performed to validate the expression profiles of the selected genes. Nine metabolic pathways were found to be significantly enriched, in the analysis of the differentially expressed genes. Several potentially interesting genes that encoded putative transcription regulators or key components involving heat shock protein (HSP), heat shock transcription factors (HSF), and antioxidants biosynthesis, were identified. These genes were highlighted to indicate their significance in response to heat stress and will be used as candidate genes to improve pansy heat-tolerance in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2975965659,"The intensive measures of luminescence in a GaN/InGaN multiple quantum well system are used to examine the thermodynamics and phenomenological structure. The radiative /nonradiative transitions along with absorbed or emitted phonons that occur between the different quantum states of the electrons and holes associated with these processes make the quantum efficiency of a semiconductor nanosystem in an equilibrium state an extensive property. It has long been recognized that tuning of the indium (In) composition in InGaN interlayers gives the potential to obtain a spectrum in the near-infrared to near-ultraviolet spectral range. The thermodynamic intensive properties, including the Debye temperature, carrier temperature, and junction temperature, are the most appropriate metrics to describe the optical-related interactions inherent in a given heterostructure and so can be used as the state variables for understanding the quantum exchange behaviors. The energetic features of the quantum processes are characterized based on analysis of the intensive parameters as determined by means of electroluminescence (EL) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and current-voltage measurement and then correlated with the designed InGaN/GaN microstructures. According to the McCumber-Sturge theory, the EL and PL Debye temperatures obtained experimentally signal the strength of the electron-phonon and photon-phonon interaction, respectively, while the EL and PL carrier/junction temperatures correspond to the carrier localization. Higher EL Debye temperatures and lower EL carrier/junction temperatures reflect significantly higher luminescence quantum yields, indicative of electron-phonon coupling in the transfer of thermal energy between the confined electrons and the enhancement by excited phonons of heat-assisted emissions. On the other hand, the observation of low luminescence efficiency, corresponding to the lower PL Debye temperatures and higher PL carrier/junction temperatures, is attributed to photon-phonon coupling. These findings are in good accordance to the dependence of the EL and PL quantum efficiency on the In-content of the InGaN/GaN barriers, suggesting that the characteristic Debye and carrier/junction temperatures are intensive parameters useful for assessing the optical properties of a nano-engineered semiconductor heterostructure."
https://openalex.org/W2976257519,"Background Though mass evacuation may increase the need for long-term care (LTC) services, how the need for LTC services increases and how the public LTC system affects it is not well understood. We evaluated changes in public LTC benefits for the people living in the mandatory evacuation areas established after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster and examined the roles of the universal LTC insurance system in Japan. Methods In order to evaluate the effect of the mandatory evacuation on LTC benefits, we examined the trends of LTC benefits in the Fukushima evacuation group and the nationwide non-evacuation group. We first decomposed per-elderly-individual benefits at the municipality level into the LTC certification rate and per-certified-individual benefits, and then implemented difference-in-differences analysis using these variables as outcomes. Results Per-elderly-individual benefits significantly increased from 2012 onward in the evacuation group, and this was explained by an increase in the certification rate rather than in per-certified-individual benefits. Increases in per-elderly-individual benefits and the certification rate in the post-disaster period were observed in all but the highest care level, and the corresponding outcomes for the highest care level decreased immediately after the disaster. We also found that the increase in the certification rate had been mostly realized by an increase in the number of certified individuals. Conclusions The increase in LTC benefits can be associated with the impact of the increase in the number of people newly certified to receive LTC benefits after the mandatory evacuation. In order to cope with the increase in utilization of long-term care and associated costs after disasters in aging societies, both formal long-term care services and social support for informal care for evacuees should be considered important."

https://openalex.org/W2975679158,"Sport fencing is an open-skilled combat sport practiced around the world. Although previous research addressed kinematics of the lunge and fleche, there are currently no studies on the flick. The flick is a high-level action that involves bending the blade toward the opponent, much like a whip or fly-fishing cast. The aim of our research was to identify the kinematic variables that significantly influence scoring success in two elite foil fencers. In particular, we asked what aspect of the movement each individual fencer can change to improve their likelihood of scoring. Two elite foil fencers of similar skill were instructed to execute flicks at a dummy target that mimicked the opponent's shoulder. High speed video (650 fps) captured the motion of the tip of the foil, blade of the foil, and limb joints; the latter were used to calculate joint angular velocities, hand height and distance throughout the flick. Scoring success was determined with a conventional scoring box. Our results showed that the two fencers exhibited significantly different kinematics, coordination and scoring. Using three complementary regression approaches, we showed that each fencer could improve scoring by changing specific aspects of their kinematics. For fencer A, only improvement in consistency in distance from the target would improve scoring. For fencer B, the changes were more complex. In addition to improvement in consistency in distance, fencer B could also increase (finger, wrist) or decrease (shoulder) joint angular velocity or improve consistency of limb joint angular velocities. Unexpectedly, and in contrast to common coaching practice, hand height had only a weak effect, possibly because both fencers had learnt to keep their hand high at the end of the action. In summary, our results emphasize that coaching of elite fencers should be individualized."
