https://openalex.org/W2164631251,"Direct and selective replacement of carbon-hydrogen bonds with new bonds (such as C-C, C-O, and C-N) represents an important and long-standing goal in chemistry. These transformations have broad potential in synthesis because C-H bonds are ubiquitous in organic substances. At the same time, achieving selectivity among many different C-H bonds remains a challenge. Here, we focus on the functionalization of C-H bonds in complex organic substrates catalyzed by transition metal catalysts. We outline the key concepts and approaches aimed at achieving selectivity in complex settings and discuss the impact these reactions have on synthetic planning and strategy in organic synthesis."

Cobalt oxide has shown excellent electrochemical cycling properties and is thus under consideration as an electrode for advanced lithium batteries. We used viruses to synthesize and assemble nanowires of cobalt oxide at room temperature. By incorporating gold-binding peptides into the filament coat, we formed hybrid gold–cobalt oxide wires that improved battery capacity. Combining virus-templated synthesis at the peptide level and methods for controlling two-dimensional assembly of viruses on polyelectrolyte multilayers provides a systematic platform for integrating these nanomaterials to form thin, flexible lithium ion batteries."
https://openalex.org/W2152350731,"Aortic aneurysm and dissection are manifestations of Marfan syndrome (MFS), a disorder caused by mutations in the gene that encodes fibrillin-1. Selected manifestations of MFS reflect excessive signaling by the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of cytokines. We show that aortic aneurysm in a mouse model of MFS is associated with increased TGF-beta signaling and can be prevented by TGF-beta antagonists such as TGF-beta-neutralizing antibody or the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) blocker, losartan. AT1 antagonism also partially reversed noncardiovascular manifestations of MFS, including impaired alveolar septation. These data suggest that losartan, a drug already in clinical use for hypertension, merits investigation as a therapeutic strategy for patients with MFS and has the potential to prevent the major life-threatening manifestation of this disorder."

In principle, evolution to this high-resistance β-lactamase might follow any of the 120 mutational trajectories linking these alleles. However, we demonstrate that 102 trajectories are inaccessible to Darwinian selection and that many of the remaining trajectories have negligible probabilities of realization, because four of these five mutations fail to increase drug resistance in some combinations. Pervasive biophysical pleiotropy within the β-lactamase seems to be responsible, and because such pleiotropy appears to be a general property of missense mutations, we conclude that much protein evolution will be similarly constrained. This implies that the protein tape of life may be largely reproducible and even predictable."

https://openalex.org/W2133078492,"Intercellular flow of the phytohormone auxin underpins multiple developmental processes in plants. Plant-specific pin-formed (PIN) proteins and several phosphoglycoprotein (PGP) transporters are crucial factors in auxin transport–related development, yet the molecular function of PINs remains unknown. Here, we show that PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. Conditional gain-of-function alleles and quantitative measurements of auxin accumulation in Arabidopsis and tobacco cultured cells revealed that the action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGP, rate-limiting, specific to auxins, and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors. This suggests a direct involvement of PINs in catalyzing cellular auxin efflux."
https://openalex.org/W2044185750,"Understanding the fundamental patterns and determinants of human cooperation and the maintenance of social order in human societies is a challenge across disciplines. The existing empirical evidence for the higher levels of cooperation when altruistic punishment is present versus when it is absent systematically ignores the institutional competition inherent in human societies. Whether punishment would be deliberately adopted and would similarly enhance cooperation when directly competing with nonpunishment institutions is highly controversial in light of recent findings on the detrimental effects of punishment. We show experimentally that a sanctioning institution is the undisputed winner in a competition with a sanction-free institution. Despite initial aversion, the entire population migrates successively to the sanctioning institution and strongly cooperates, whereas the sanction-free society becomes fully depopulated. The findings demonstrate the competitive advantage of sanctioning institutions and exemplify the emergence and manifestation of social order driven by institutional selection."
https://openalex.org/W2137231405,Polar flow of the phytohormone auxin requires plasma membrane‐associated PIN proteins and underlies multiple developmental processes in plants. Here we address the importance of the polarity of subcellular PIN localization for the directionality of auxin transport in Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression of different PINs in the root epidermis revealed the importance of PIN polar positions for directional auxin flow and root gravitropic growth. Interfering with sequence-embedded polarity signals directly demonstrates that PIN polarity is a primary factor in determining the direction of auxin flow in meristematic tissues. This finding provides a crucial piece in the puzzle of how auxin flow can be redirected via rapid changes in PIN polarity.

All but two subfamilies are recovered as monophyletic. Divergence time estimates calibrated by minimum age constraints from 43 fossils indicate that most of the subfamilies representing extant ants arose much earlier than previously proposed but only began to diversify during the Late Cretaceous to Early Eocene. This period also witnessed the rise of angiosperms and most herbivorous insects."
https://openalex.org/W2007486557,"The liver can regenerate its volume after major tissue loss. In a mouse model of liver regeneration, thrombocytopenia, or impaired platelet activity resulted in the failure to initiate cellular proliferation in the liver. Platelets are major carriers of serotonin in the blood. In thrombocytopenic mice, a serotonin agonist reconstituted liver proliferation. The expression of 5-HT2A and 2B subtype serotonin receptors in the liver increased after hepatectomy. Antagonists of 5-HT2A and 2B receptors inhibited liver regeneration. Liver regeneration was also blunted in mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase 1, which is the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of peripheral serotonin. This failure of regeneration was rescued by reloading serotonin-free platelets with a serotonin precursor molecule. These results suggest that platelet-derived serotonin is involved in the initiation of liver regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2123653059,"According to Darwinian theory, complexity evolves by a stepwise process of elaboration and optimization under natural selection. Biological systems composed of tightly integrated parts seem to challenge this view, because it is not obvious how any element's function can be selected for unless the partners with which it interacts are already present. Here we demonstrate how an integrated molecular system—the specific functional interaction between the steroid hormone aldosterone and its partner the mineralocorticoid receptor—evolved by a stepwise Darwinian process. Using ancestral gene resurrection, we show that, long before the hormone evolved, the receptor's affinity for aldosterone was present as a structural by-product of its partnership with chemically similar, more ancient ligands. Introducing two amino acid changes into the ancestral sequence recapitulates the evolution of present-day receptor specificity. Our results indicate that tight interactions can evolve by molecular exploitation—recruitment of an older molecule, previously constrained for a different role, into a new functional complex."
https://openalex.org/W1997381585,"We have demonstrated laser cooling of a single electron spin trapped in a semiconductor quantum dot. Optical coupling of electronic spin states was achieved using resonant excitation of the charged quantum dot (trion) transitions along with the heavy-light hole mixing, which leads to weak yet finite rates for spin-flip Raman scattering. With this mechanism, the electron spin can be cooled from 4.2 to 0.020 kelvin, as confirmed by the strength of the induced Pauli blockade of the trion absorption. Within the framework of quantum information processing, this corresponds to a spin-state preparation with a fidelity exceeding 99.8%."
https://openalex.org/W2144275955,"Biological responses to histone methylation critically depend on the faithful readout and transduction of the methyl-lysine signal by “effector” proteins, yet our understanding of methyl-lysine recognition has so far been limited to the study of histone binding by chromodomain and WD40-repeat proteins. The double tudor domain of JMJD2A, a Jmjc domain–containing histone demethylase, binds methylated histone H3-K4 and H4-K20. We found that the double tudor domain has an interdigitated structure, and the unusual fold is required for its ability to bind methylated histone tails. The cocrystal structure of the JMJD2A double tudor domain with a trimethylated H3-K4 peptide reveals that the trimethyl-K4 is bound in a cage of three aromatic residues, two of which are from the tudor-2 motif, whereas the binding specificity is determined by side-chain interactions involving amino acids from the tudor-1 motif. Our study provides mechanistic insights into recognition of methylated histone tails by tudor domains and reveals the structural intricacy of methyl-lysine recognition by two closely spaced effector domains."

https://openalex.org/W1975437766,"A tropical Pacific climate state resembling that of a permanent El Niño is hypothesized to have ended as a result of a reorganization of the ocean heat budget ∼3 million years ago, a time when large ice sheets appeared in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. We report a high-resolution alkenone reconstruction of conditions in the heart of the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) cold tongue that reflects the combined influences of changes in the equatorial thermocline, the properties of the thermocline's source waters, atmospheric greenhouse gas content, and orbital variations on sea surface temperature (SST) and biological productivity over the past 5 million years. Our data indicate that the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation ∼3 million years ago did not interrupt an almost monotonic cooling of the EEP during the Plio-Pleistocene. SST and productivity in the eastern tropical Pacific varied in phase with global ice volume changes at a dominant 41,000-year (obliquity) frequency throughout this time. Changes in the Southern Hemisphere most likely modulated most of the changes observed."
https://openalex.org/W1989068240,"The quantum description of light as photons leads to predictions that have no classical counterpart. Coalescence is a striking example: when two identical photons arrive simultaneously at the two sides of a partially reflecting mirror, they always leave the mirror together. Beugnon et al. demonstrate this effect by producing quantum interference between two single photons emitted by two independently trapped atoms. This is a step towards synchronized, independent sources emitting indistinguishable photons. Such sources would be a useful resource for quantum data processing. A collection of synchronized, independent sources emitting indistinguishable photons represents a highly useful resource for quantum data processing. Demonstration of quantum interference between two single photons emitted by two independently trapped single atoms is an important step towards this goal. When two indistinguishable single photons are fed into the two input ports of a beam splitter, the photons will coalesce and leave together from the same output port. This is a quantum interference effect, which occurs because two possible paths—in which the photons leave by different output ports—interfere destructively. This effect was first observed in parametric downconversion1 (in which a nonlinear crystal splits a single photon into two photons of lower energy), then from two separate downconversion crystals2, as well as with single photons produced one after the other by the same quantum emitter3,4,5,6. With the recent developments in quantum information research, much attention has been devoted to this interference effect as a resource for quantum data processing using linear optics techniques2,7,8,9,10,11. To ensure the scalability of schemes based on these ideas, it is crucial that indistinguishable photons are emitted by a collection of synchronized, but otherwise independent sources. Here we demonstrate the quantum interference of two single photons emitted by two independently trapped single atoms, bridging the gap towards the simultaneous emission of many indistinguishable single photons by different emitters. Our data analysis shows that the observed coalescence is mainly limited by wavefront matching of the light emitted by the two atoms, and to a lesser extent by the motion of each atom in its own trap."
https://openalex.org/W2048663379,"The idea of ‘fallback’ in supernova explosions, where some of the explosion ejecta fail to escape, has been invoked to explain black-hole formation, the spin distribution of magnetars, and the origin of Earth-mass planets around pulsars. Until now there has been no direct evidence that the process occurs. But a cool dust disk around an isolated young X-ray pulsar, detected in data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, may be the first supernova fallback disk to have been observed. By analogy with protoplanetary disks around ordinary stars, a passive debris disk like this around a neutron star could be a site of planet formation. Pulsars are rotating, magnetized neutron stars that are born in supernova explosions following the collapse of the cores of massive stars. If some of the explosion ejecta fails to escape, it may fall back onto the neutron star1 or it may possess sufficient angular momentum to form a disk2. Such ‘fallback’ is both a general prediction of current supernova models3 and, if the material pushes the neutron star over its stability limit, a possible mode of black hole formation4. Fallback disks could dramatically affect the early evolution of pulsars2,5, yet there are few observational constraints on whether significant fallback occurs or even the actual existence of such disks. Here we report the discovery of mid-infrared emission from a cool disk around an isolated young X-ray pulsar. The disk does not power the pulsar's X-ray emission but is passively illuminated by these X-rays. The estimated mass of the disk is of the order of 10 Earth masses, and its lifetime (≥ 106 years) significantly exceeds the spin-down age of the pulsar, supporting a supernova fallback origin. The disk resembles protoplanetary disks seen around ordinary young stars6, suggesting the possibility of planet formation around young neutron stars."

CorA-type transporters are the main Mg2+ uptake system in most prokaryotes and in mitochondria. Now the crystal structure of bacterial CorA in the closed state has been determined. The transporter is a funnel-shaped homopentamer; the presence of a conserved Mg2+ binding site in the cytoplasmic domain suggests a mechanism to link the gating of the pore to the intracellular concentration of the ion. The magnesium ion, Mg2+, is essential for myriad biochemical processes and remains the only major biological ion whose transport mechanisms remain unknown. The CorA family of magnesium transporters is the primary Mg2+ uptake system of most prokaryotes1,2,3 and a functional homologue of the eukaryotic mitochondrial magnesium transporter4. Here we determine crystal structures of the full-length Thermotoga maritima CorA in an apparent closed state and its isolated cytoplasmic domain at 3.9 Å and 1.85 Å resolution, respectively. The transporter is a funnel-shaped homopentamer with two transmembrane helices per monomer. The channel is formed by an inner group of five helices and putatively gated by bulky hydrophobic residues. The large cytoplasmic domain forms a funnel whose wide mouth points into the cell and whose walls are formed by five long helices that are extensions of the transmembrane helices. The cytoplasmic neck of the pore is surrounded, on the outside of the funnel, by a ring of highly conserved positively charged residues. Two negatively charged helices in the cytoplasmic domain extend back towards the membrane on the outside of the funnel and abut the ring of positive charge. An apparent Mg2+ ion was bound between monomers at a conserved site in the cytoplasmic domain, suggesting a mechanism to link gating of the pore to the intracellular concentration of Mg2+."

https://openalex.org/W2153631395,"Dialysis-related amyloidosis is characterized by the deposition of insoluble fibrils ofβ2-microglobulin (β2-m) in the musculoskeletal system. Atomic force microscopy inspection of ex vivo amyloid material reveals the presence of bundles of fibrils often associated to collagen fibrils. Aggregation experiments were undertaken in vitro with the aim of reproducing the physiopathological fibrillation process. To this purpose, atomic force microscopy, fluorescence techniques, and NMR were employed. We found that in temperature and pH conditions similar to those occurring in periarticular tissues in the presence of flogistic processes, β2-m fibrillogenesis takes place in the presence of fibrillar collagen, whereas no fibrils are obtained without collagen. Moreover, the morphology ofβ2-m fibrils obtained in vitro in the presence of collagen is extremely similar to that observed in the ex vivo sample. This result indicates that collagen plays a crucial role in β2-m amyloid deposition under physiopathological conditions and suggests an explanation for the strict specificity of dialysis-related amyloidosis for the tissues of the skeletal system. We hypothesize that positively charged regions along the collagen fiber could play a direct role inβ2-m fibrillogenesis. This hypothesis is sustained by aggregation experiments performed by replacing collagen with a poly-l-lysine-coated mica surface. As shown by NMR measurements, no similar process occurs when poly-l-lysine is dissolved in solution with β2-m. Overall, the findings are consistent with the estimates resulting from a simplified collagen model whereby electrostatic effects can lead to high local concentrations of oppositely charged species, such as β2-m, that decay on moving away from the fiber surface.

The deposition of β2-microglobulin (β2-m) 2The abbreviations used are: β2-m, β2-microglobulin; DRA, dialysis-related amyloidosis; ThT, thioflavin T; AFM, atomic force microscopy; TM-AFM, tapping mode AFM. into amyloid fibrils is the hallmark of dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA), a disease arising as a complication of long-term hemodialysis. β2-m is a 99-residue protein (molecular mass 11.7 kDa) that represents the light chain of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI), an integral membrane protein involved in the immune response. As a result of normal MHCI catabolism, β2-m is released in the serum from the cell surface and carried to the kidney for clearance. In the presence of kidney failure, the concentration of free circulating β2-m can increase by up to 50-fold; the persistent increase in β2-m concentration results in amyloid deposition, preferentially localized in the musculoskeletal system. The accumulation of β2-m deposits has been shown to cause arthralgias, destructive osteoarthropathies, and carpal tunnel syndrome (1Drüeke T.B. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2000; 15: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although a high concentration of β2-m is a necessary condition for the onset of the disease, there is not a strict correlation between the disease severity and β2-m levels (2Floege J. Ehlerding G. Nephron. 1996; 72: 9-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), suggesting that other factors might be involved in β2-m amyloid deposition. The aggregation process of β2-m has been the object of extensive investigation for many years. Several experiments have been designed to reproduce β2-m amyloid deposition in vitro and to understand the molecular conformational changes involved in this process. Spontaneous assembly of β2-m amyloid fibrils was observed in vitro under acidic conditions hardly compatible with the physiologic ones; in this case the morphology of in vitro fibrils was influenced by pH and ionic strength (3Kad N.M. Thomson N.H. Smith D.P. Radford Smith D. A.S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 4Kad N.M. Myers S.L. Smith D.P. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. Thomson N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It has been reported that, at neutral pH, β2-m can form fibrils in the presence of high concentrations of free copper ions (5Morgan C.J. Gelfand M. Atreya C. Miranker A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, at neutral pH, β2-m can elongate preformed fibrils when the solution contains trifluoroethanol (6Yamamoto S. Yamaguchi I. Hasegawa K. Tsutsumi S. Goto Y. Gejyo F. Naiki H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) or sodium dodecyl sulfate (7Kihara M. Chatani E. Sakai M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol.

Grossi S. Mangione P. Giorgetti S. Caccialanza G. Dobson C.M. Merlini G. Ramponi G. Bellotti V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46714-46721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The ability of β2-m to elongate preformed fibrils at neutral pH is also enhanced by truncation at the N terminus (9Esposito G. Michelutti R. Verdone G. Viglino P. Hernández H. Robinson C.V. Amoresano A. Dal Piaz F. Monti M. Pucci P. Mangione P. Stoppini M. Merlini G. Ferri G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) as well as by cleavage of the peptide bond at the carbonyl side of Lys-58 (10Heegaard N.H. Jorgensen T. J. Rozlosnik Corlin N. Pedersen D.B. Tempesta J.S. Roepstorff A.G. Bauer P. Nissen R.M.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4397-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although the information resulting from these in vitro experiments can contribute to insight into the aggregation process of β2-m, it cannot be directly related to in vivo fibrillogenesis. A further step toward the understanding of β2-m fibrillation in vivo is required, by designing aggregation conditions as close as possible to the physiopathological ones. One of the most surprising properties of DRA is its strict specificity for tissues of the skeletal system, despite the fact that β2-m is ubiquitously released throughout the body from every cell expressing the major histocompatibility complex class I. In all patients, in fact, bones and ligaments are primarily involved. Therefore, it might be speculated that the molecular environment that β2-m encounters in the skeletal system might favor the local protein aggregation and formation of amyloid fibrils. Two macromolecules highly represented in these tissues, glycosaminoglycans and collagen, have been investigated as a putative target of β2-m deposition. Ohashi et al. (11Ohashi K. Kisilevsky R. Yanagishita M. Nephron. 2002; 90: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have found that β2-m binds glycosaminoglycans with a Kd of ∼1 × 10–5. Our group has shown that β2-m binds collagen, giving an adduct with similar affinity, whereas with the truncated β2-m form lacking six amino acids at the N terminus the collagen adduct exhibits a 10-fold higher affinity (12Giorgetti S. Rossi A. Mangione P. Raimondi S. Marini S. Stoppini M. Corazza A. Viglino P. Esposito G. Cetta G. Bellotti V. MerliniG. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this work we have explored the fibrillogenesis of β2-m under physiopathological conditions by atomic force microscopy, which is one of the most sensitive and specific techniques currently available to study amyloid aggregate morphology (13Relini A. Canale C. Torrassa S. Rolandi R. Gliozzi A. Rosano C. Bolognesi M. Plakoutsi G. Bucciantini M. Chiti F. Stefani M. J. Mol.

We started from the inspection of ex vivo material and then settled on a procedure for monitoring by AFM the process of β2-m aggregation in vitro under conditions as close as possible to the physiopathological ones. Thioflavin T assay was employed to check fibril formation in solution, while NMR spectroscopy was used to monitor possible changes of the protein structure in solution. Our experiments revealed a strict association between β2-m fibrils and collagen fibrils and suggest that collagen might act as a catalyzer for fibril formation as a consequence of its positive surface charge. To test this hypothesis, we performed aggregation experiments in the presence of artificial positively charged surfaces. Finally, a simplified model of the collagen fiber was developed to analyze direct and/or orientational electrostatic effects that could lead to an accumulation of β2-m at the charged interface. Extraction and Purification of ex Vivo β2-m Amyloid Material—Amyloid fibrils were extracted from amyloid deposits isolated from the femoral head of a patient admitted for hip replacement surgery. The material was homogenized in 2 ml of 10 mm Tris/EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 1.5 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/100 mg of tissue and centrifuged at 50,000 × g in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman L8–704; Beckman Instruments) for 30 min and the supernatant removed. After this step was repeated nine times, the absorbance measurement at 280 nm was <0.05. The pellet was then homogenized in water in the presence of 1.5 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride following the procedure of Gejyo et al. (16Gejyo F. Yamada T. Odani S. Nakagawa Y. Arakawa M.

The yield in fibrils was monitored by microscopic analysis of the extracted material stained with Congo Red. Expression and Purification of Recombinant β2-m—Expression and purification of recombinant β2-m and ΔN6β2m were carried out as previously reported (9Esposito G. Michelutti R. Verdone G. Viglino P.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The concentration of the protein sample was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm by using an extinction coefficient (A 1 cm%) of 16.17 for β2m and 17.22 for ΔN6β2m. Preparation of Type I Fibrillar Collagen—Type I collagen was purified from calf skin as previously described (12Giorgetti S. Rossi A. Mangione P. Raimondi S. Marini S. Stoppini M. Corazza A. Viglino P. Esposito G. Cetta G. Bellotti V. MerliniG. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The purity of collagen was checked by SDS-PAGE, and the concentration of the collagen solutions was determined by the hydroxyproline assay according to Huszar et al. (17Huszar G. Maiocco J. Naftolin F. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Fibrillar collagen was prepared by solubilizing purified collagen in 5 mm acetic acid. The solution was diluted 1:1 with 2× phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Thioflavin T Assay—Quantification of amyloid fibril formation was performed with the method described by LeVine (18LeVine H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). Thioflavin T (ThT) concentration was 5 mm, and the buffer used was 50 mm glycine NaOH, pH 8.5. Measurements were made using a LS50 PerkinElmer spectrofluorometer with excitation at 455 nm; emission was collected at 485 nm. The slits were set at 5 mm. Congo Red Birefringence—Congo Red birefringence of β2-m fibrils grown in the presence of collagen was assayed as described previously (19Puchtler H. Sweat F. Levine M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1962; 10: 355-364Crossref Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—1H NMR spectra were obtained at 500.13 MHz with a Bruker Avance spectrometer on 0.1–0.63-mm solutions of pure β2-m or mixed with poly-l-lysine (hydrobromide, viscosimetric MWav 55,200; Sigma). The average molecular mass of 50 kDa was adopted to calculate poly-l-lysine amounts to be added to the β2-m solution. Samples were dissolved in H2O/D2O 90/10 or 95/5 with 50–70 mm phosphate buffer, 50–100 mm NaCl and pH in the range 6.5–6.7 or in 150 mm deuterated ammonium acetate at pH 6.4. Deuterium oxide (D 99.9%) was from Aldrich; d4-acetic-acid (D 99.5%) was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Samples were filtered using 20-nm pore Whatman filters. The studies were carried out at 37 and 40 °C. For the pure protein samples two-dimensional TOCSY (20Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3112) Google Scholar) spectra were acquired as previously reported (21Corazza A. Pettirossi F. Viglino P. Verdone G. Garcia J. Dumy P. Giorgetti S. Mangione P. Raimondi S. Stoppini M. Bellotti V. Esposito G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9176-9189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Experiments with poly-l-lysine were carried out on filtered samples of protein at pH 6.6 (0.63 mm β2-m, 70 mm phosphate buffer, 100 mm NaCl) and pH 6.4 (0.50 mm β2-m, 150 mm ammonium acetate-d3). The protein samples were incubated at those conditions for 24 h at 37 °C before addition of calculated amounts of poly-l-lysine directly into the NMR tube at final concentrations ∼0.04 mm (β2-m/poly-l-lysine 14–16/1). The interaction between β2-m and poly-l-lysine was monitored at 37 °C over 7–9 days by alternating acquisitions of one- and two-dimensional diffusion-ordered spectroscopy NMR experiments (22Morris K.F. Johnson Jr., C.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3139-3141Crossref Scopus (657) Google Scholar). To remove the effects of convective motions, a compensated pulse sequence was used (23Jerschow A. Müller N. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 125: 372-375Crossref Scopus (570) Google Scholar) including solvent suppression by excitation sculpting (24Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). The length of the diffusion time was between 60 and 90 ms, and the duration of the encoding/decoding gradient was 3–4 ms. Using the same two-dimensional acquisition parameter as described for TOCSY, 131 increments (128 scans/increment) were collected in the indirect dimension, with a gradient strength varying from 2 to 95% of the maximum (68 G/cm). Data processing and analysis were performed using Felix software (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA), and spectra were referenced on the L23 CdH3 resonance peak (21Corazza A. Pettirossi F. Viglino P. Verdone G. Garcia J. Dumy P. Giorgetti S. Mangione P. Raimondi S. Stoppini M. Bellotti V. Esposito G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9176-9189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Diffusion-ordered spectroscopy spectra were analyzed by means of the routines of GIFA 4.4 (25Pons J.L. Malliavin T.E. Delsuc M.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), i.e., single-exponential fitting and inverse Laplace transformation with the maximum entropy. Fitting was performed on the most intense peaks from β2-m and poly-l-lysine, and final results were estimated from averaging over the values affected by small errors (<2%). Mass Spectrometry—Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry analysis was carried out with a Q-STAR spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/PE SCIEX), operating in positive electrospray ionization mode at atmospheric pressure and coupled to an Agilent 1100 series micro-LC pump equipped with a Phenomenex Jupiter 5 μ C4 300 Å (150 × 0.50 mm) column for standard reverse phase chromatographic elution. Typically, the pellet deposited in the NMR tube was isolated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g and dissolved in 5 m guanidinium chloride (BDH) to get 0.1–0.3 mm concentration of denatured β2-m. Aliquots of treated pellet and of NMR tube surfactant were diluted 20-fold by 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid aqueous solution before running liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The analysis was systematically repeated by direct infusion of trifluoroacetic acid-free aqueous solution for the optimal detection of the highly charged poly-l-lysine polypeptide. Atomic Force Microscopy—AFM images were acquired in tapping mode using a Multimode Scanning Probe microscope (Digital Instruments-Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with an “E” scanning head (maximum scan size 10 μm) and driven by a Nanoscope IV controller. For larger scan sizes, a Dimension 3000 microscope (Digital Instruments-Veeco), equipped with a “G” scanning head (maximum scan size 100 μm) and driven by a Nanoscope IIIa controller, was employed. Single-beam uncoated silicon cantilevers (type OMCL-AC, Olympus, and RTESP, Veeco) were used for air imaging. For imaging in liquid, we used V-shaped gold-coated Si3N4 cantilevers (200 μm length, nominal spring constant 0.06 N/m) with pyramidal tips having nominal curvature radii of ∼40 nm. The drive frequency was ∼300 kHz in air and 6 kHz in liquid; the scan rate was between 0.3 and 0.8 Hz. Vertical displacements were calibrated measuring the depth of grating notches (180 nm) and the half unit cell steps (1 nm) obtained by treating freshly cleaved mica with hydrofluoric acid. The horizontal displacements of the piezoelectric tubes were calibrated using a 3-μm pitch diffraction grating. Aggregation of β2-m—Lyophilized β2-m was dissolved in ammonium acetate 50 mm, pH 7.4, at the concentration of 2 mg/ml and centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 1 h to remove large aggregates. The supernatant was collected and filtered with a 20-nm pore filter; protein concentration was then determined using a Jasco V-530 spectrophotometer. Aggregation experiments were performed at protein concentrations in the 0.2–0.4 mg/ml range, after acidification of the protein solution to pH 6.4 by using an HCl solution at pH 2. The final ammonium acetate concentration was in the 12–30 mm range. For AFM inspection, 20-μl aliquots of the sample kept in an incubator at the chosen temperature were extracted at different times during the aggregation reaction, deposited onto freshly cleaved mica, and dried under mild vacuum. For the experiments in the presence of collagen, fibrillar collagen was sonicated for 10 min in a bath sonicator (ACAD, Genoa, Italy), washed with the ammonium acetate buffer, and, while keeping it under hydration on a microscope slide, cut into several pieces that were washed again and added to the protein solution. Aggregation was performed under the same conditions described above, except for the protein concentration, which was increased to 0.5 or 0.6 mg/ml. For AFM inspection, a piece of collagen with its surrounding protein solution was extracted from the sample, deposited onto freshly cleaved mica, and dried under mild vacuum. Poly-l-lysine-coated mica substrates were prepared by incubating a drop (typically 10 μl) of 1 mg/ml of poly-l-lysine solution onto freshly cleaved mica for 2 min; the excess polymer was then washed out with the buffer used for the protein. Aliquots of the protein sample extracted at different aggregation times were deposited onto poly-l-lysine-coated mica, incubated for 10 min, washed with buffer, and then imaged under liquid. Zeta Potential Measurements—Zeta potential was measured at 25 °C with a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments) at a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml in ammonium acetate 25 mm, pH 6.4. Each measurement was performed on a freshly extracted aliquot of the protein sample incubated at 40 °C and pH 6.4. Analysis of ex Vivo β2-m Amyloid Material—Ex vivo fibrillar material was extracted from the amyloid deposits surgically obtained from a patient who after 20 years of chronic hemodialysis suffered from femoral fracture. The AFM analysis of this material revealed the presence of bundles of fibrils of typical length between 0.7 and 3 μm and height between 1.5 and 3 nm. As the sample was dried under mild vacuum to facilitate its adhesion to the mica substrate, this procedure resulted in a reduction in the size of the imaged objects due to dehydration and/or deformation. Similar results have been obtained by other groups using tapping mode AFM in air to image amyloid fibrils (26Hatters D.M. MacRaild C.A. Daniels R. Gosal W.S. Thomson N.H. Jones J.A. Davis J.J. MacPhee C.E. Dobson C.M. Howlett G.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3979-3990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Previous control measurements yielded a correction factor of ∼2.5 for monomeric globular proteins; in the case of amyloid fibrils, however, this factor may be larger (∼5) (14Relini A. Rolandi R. Bolognesi M. Gliozzi A. Aboudan M. Merlini G. Bellotti V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1690: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Taking into account this correction, the measured sizes are compatible with those generally acknowledged as peculiar to amyloid fibrils (27Stefani M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Ex vivo β2-m fibrils are closely packed laterally to generate a kind of planar sheet or plaque (Fig. 1). To obtain a reliable estimate of fibril height, the statistical analysis of the fibril height in cross-section was performed considering only measurements obtained on those fibrils that were sufficiently separated from the rest, thus avoiding artifacts possibly induced by fibril close packing. A fibril height of 2.4 ± 0.4 nm was obtained. Adjacent fibrils are often partially interconnected or supercoiled (Fig. 1a). A very interesting feature of the ex vivo material is that β2-m fibrils are often found in association to collagen fibrils, as shown in Fig. 1b and in the surface reconstructions reported in Fig. 2. Collagen fibrils are much thicker than amyloid fibrils and exhibit the characteristic banding pattern with a periodicity of 67 nm. The height of the collagen fibril shown in Fig. 2 is 50 nm, while its width is ∼300 nm. The latter value is much larger than expected as a result of broadening effects due to the AFM tip size and indicates that the collagen fibril is flattened on the mica surface. The measured sizes, however, are consistent with the well known diameter of collagen fibrils (28Lodish H. Baltimore D. Berk A. Zipursky S.L. Matsudaira P. Darnell J. Molecular Cell Biology. 1995; (W. H. Freeman & Company, New York): 1128Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Surface plots of a TM-AFM image (height data) of β2-m ex vivo amyloid material obtained from the femoral head of a patient affected by DRA. a, amyloid fibrils surrounding a collagen fibril. b, higher resolution image of a portion of panel a showing amyloid fibrils crowding around the collagen fibril.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Designing Conditions for β2-m Fibrillation in Vitro—To model the conditions occurring in vivo in periarticular tissues of patients subject to long-term hemodialysis, we chose to operate at pH 6.4, a value reported to be plausible in the synovial fluids in the presence of flogistic processes (29Ward T.T. Steigbigel R.T. Am. J. Med. 1978; 64: 933-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out at temperatures of 37 °C, mimicking the physiologic state, and 40 °C, which could represent the extreme temperature occurring in the presence of fever. When β2-m is dissolved at pH 6.4, isolated tangles of fibrils can already occasionally be observed at room temperature (not shown). This scanty formation of fibrils could be due to the presence of small seeds that are not removed by filtration with the 20-nm pore filter. To avoid the presence of this material, all the experiments discussed below were performed by first dissolving the protein at pH 7.4, which results in a more stable sample with negligible fibril formation, and then lowering the pH to 6.4 just at the start of the aggregation experiment. Fig. 3a shows typical patterns observed for β2-m kept at 40 °C and pH 6.4. A relatively low number of globular aggregates and rare filamentous structures are found. The height of the latter is between 0.6 and 1.0 nm; taking into account the dehydration effects discussed above, it is consistent with protofilament rather than fibril size. The number of aggregates of both kind observed over a 30 × 30-μm scan area at different aggregation times is shown in the histogram in Fig. 3b. These results show that at the concentrations employed in our experiments (30–50 μm), β2-m does not exhibit massive aggregation in vitro at 40 °C and pH 6.4, although there is a significant increase in the number of aggregates within 1 h from the start of the aggregation process. However, no increase in ThT fluorescence was observed, indicating that the amount of cross-β-structured protein is too low to provide a significant fluorescence signal. After 6 days of aggregation, neither fibrils nor filaments were observed and only a few globular structures (5 ± 1 over a 30 × 30-μm area) were found. The results obtained for β2-m at 40 °C and pH 6.4 are in agreement with those obtained under different ionic strength conditions and slightly lower temperature (37 °C) by McParland et al. (30McParland V.J. Kad N.M. Kalverda A.P. Brown A. Kirwin-Jones P. Hunter M.G. Sunde M. Radford S.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The same experiment was repeated with the addition of 30% of the truncated form of the protein ΔN6β2-m, i.e., the variant devoid of the first six residues at the N terminus. In this case the sample morphology after 30 min at 40 °C was similar to that observed with wild-type β2-m, whereas after 3 h large globular aggregates 70–300 nm high were found to coexist with straight, flat aggregates 2–3 nm high and a few hundred nm wide, resembling two-dimensional crystals (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, filament loops (indicated by the arrows in Fig. 4) often detach from the body of the flat aggregates. The filament size is compatible with that measured for β2-m alone. The histogram in Fig. 3d shows the counts of filamentous and other structures. Compared with the experiment with wild-type β2-m alone, a much larger number of nonfilamentous aggregates is found, whereas the number of filaments does not increase. The aggregate morphologies observed in vitro at 40 °C and pH 6.4 for β2-m and ΔN6β2-m-enriched β2-m are completely different from those observed in the ex vivo amyloid material, as non-fibrillar morphologies prevail. In addition, no increase in ThT fluorescence is detected during aggregation, indicating that no amyloid formation occurs. From these experiments we have therefore concluded that in these conditions β2-m was unable to make amyloid fibrils despite the formation of various types of other aggregates. A new set of experiments was then carried out under the same conditions described above but in the presence of fibrillar collagen of type I. After 4 days of aggregation we observed the formation of bundles of fibrils whose morphology was extremely similar to that reported in Figs. 1 and 2 for the ex vivo sample. Also in this case fibrils were not isolated but grew with a close lateral packing. Fibril formation was more extensive as the aggregation time increased (Fig. 5, a and b). When the protein was prefiltered with a 0.22-instead of 0.02-μm pore filter the aggregation kinetics was accelerated, resulting in fibril formation already after 2 days of aggregation (Figs. 5, c and d, and 6a). Because these experiments were carried out at 40 °C, which is close to denaturation conditions for collagen, control experiments in the absence of β2-m were also performed to rule out possible temperature-induced modificat"

The new data show that NMDARs exist on the myelin sheath formed by oligodendrocytes, that an uncompetitive NMDAR antagonist has successfully passed human clinical trials, and that NMDARs trigger multiple deleterious cascades to inflict cellular damage on both neurons and glia during cerebral ischemia (stroke). These recent findings bode well for clinical intervention with NMDAR antagonists in more neurological disorders than previously thought, including multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy (periventricular leukomalacia), and spinal cord injury. Recent reports have overturned a series of dogmas that have been well entrenched in the neuroscience literature concerning NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). The new data show that NMDARs exist on the myelin sheath formed by oligodendrocytes, that an uncompetitive NMDAR antagonist has successfully passed human clinical trials, and that NMDARs trigger multiple deleterious cascades to inflict cellular damage on both neurons and glia during cerebral ischemia (stroke). These recent findings bode well for clinical intervention with NMDAR antagonists in more neurological disorders than previously thought, including multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy (periventricular leukomalacia), and spinal cord injury. The latest scientific myth to be dispelled concerns oligodendrocytes, the glial cells that produce the myelin sheath of axons in the brain. Previously, it was widely held that oligodendrocytes have only AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) and kainate-type glutamate receptors that contribute to their demise. This dogma was recently refuted by work in three independent laboratories and may have far-reaching implications for the treatment of a variety of neurological disorders. The laboratories involved are those of David Attwell (University College, London), Robert Fern (University of Leicester), and Peter Stys (University of Ottawa). The three groups published new work in a single issue of Nature showing that N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) are prominent on oligodendrocytes or their processes that myelinate axons and that excessive influx of Ca2+ via NMDAR-associated ion channels leads to damage of these cells. Previously, NMDAR-type glutamate receptors were known to exist on neurons and were thought to contribute to neuronal damage during ischemia and various neurodegenerative disorders. However, NMDARs were not generally thought to effect oligodendrocyte/myelin injury because these cells were said to lack such receptors. While there were some hints from immunocytochemical evidence that NMDARs might exist on glial cells, these data were largely ignored. A few groups had previously reported the presence of functional NMDARs on rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells from neurohypophysial explants, on human dissociated Müller cells from the retina, and on mouse astrocytic processes in neocortical slices (Wang et al., 1996Wang C. Pralong W.F. Schulz M.F. Rougon G. Aubry J.M. Pagliusi S. Robert A. Kiss J.Z. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1565-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, Puro et al., 1996Puro D.G. Yuan J.P. Sucher N.J. Vis. Neurosci. 1996; 13: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, Schipke et al., 2001Schipke C.G. Ohlemeyer C. Matyash M. Nolte C. Kettenmann H. Kirchhoff F. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1270-1272PubMed Google Scholar), but again the widely-held view was that these receptors were rare or not important on glial cells. Very recently, Lalo et al., 2006Lalo U. Pankratov Y. Kirchhoff F. North R.A. Verkhratsky A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2673-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar performed whole-cell recordings with patch electrodes on astrocytes identified in culture or in slices prepared from transgenic mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein under the control of the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter. This group found that functional NMDARs contribute to ionic currents in cortical astrocytes and that these receptors are involved in physiological neuron-to-astrocyte signal transmission. Thus, increasing evidence points to the fact that functional NMDARs exist on glial cells, including both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Concerning the potential pathophysiological relevance of these new findings, impairment of oligodendrocytes and myelination—leading to what is termed “white matter” disease—is a major factor in hypoxic-ischemic disease (stroke), cerebral palsy (periventricular leukomalacia), spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis. Hence, the presence of functional NMDARs on these cells implies that NMDAR antagonists, heretofore thought not to exert a large effect on these glial cells, might be able to protect them from these disease processes. In the first new paper considered here on cells of oligodendrocytic lineage (Káradóttir et al., 2005Káradóttir R. Cavelier P. Bergersen L.H. Attwell D. Nature. 2005; 438: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), David Attwell's group performed patch-clamp recordings from rat oligodendrocyte precursors and from immature and mature oligodendrocytes in slice preparations of cerebellum and corpus callosum. During both simulated ischemic conditions and with the application of glutamate, currents were at least partially inhibited by NMDAR antagonists. With a critical eye, one might say that these currents were not robust and exhibited rundown. Nonetheless, these recordings are technically quite demanding and a real tour-de-force. In this context, they are quite impressive and strongly support the existence of functional NMDARs on these cells. The group of Salter and Fern, 2005Salter M.G. Fern R. Nature. 2005; 438: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar examined oligodendrocytes in the developing mouse optic nerve. They found that oxygen and glucose deprivation (to simulate ischemia) produced damage to oligodendrocyte processes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Although blockade of AMPA or kainate receptors protected oligodendrocyte cell bodies, they did not protect their processes. Only NMDAR antagonists prevented this type of injury. While most of these methods are indirect, taken together with the electrophysiology recordings of the Attwell group, the evidence for NMDARs is fairly strong, and the implications for an effect of NMDARs on oligodendrocyte survival are provocative to say the least. Finally, the group led by Peter Stys (Micu et al., 2006Micu I. Jiang Q. Coderre E. Ridsdale A. Zhang L. Woulfe J. Yin X. Trapp B.D. McRory J.E. Rehak R. et al.Nature. 2006; 439: 988-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) studied adult rat optic nerve and found that the Ca2+ concentration of myelin encasing the nerve dramatically increased during chemically induced ischemia. NMDAR antagonists, but not AMPA or kainate receptor antagonists, prevented this rise in Ca2+ and the consequent myelin damage. In addition to the pathophysiological significance of these findings, this report also raises the possibility of physiological glutamate signaling from axon to myelin mediated by NMDARs. Looking critically, this evidence for functional NMDARs on adult myelin is somewhat indirect, since Ca2+ imaging is involved rather than direct electrophysiological recording of currents. However, coupled with immunocytochemical data from all three labs for the presence of NMDAR subunits on oligodendrocytes, it is very hard to dismiss these data, which imply that NMDARs are pathophysiologically relevant to oligodendrocyte and myelin function. Nonetheless, to be balanced and given the complexities of myelin, we must acknowledge that with present techniques it is not possible to directly show the presence of functional NMDARs on adult myelin, e.g., with patch-clamp recording techniques. Interestingly, all three of these studies suggested that the NMDAR-mediated currents of oligodendrocytes were made up of not only NR1 and various NR2 NMDA receptor subunits but also NR3A subunits. As we and our colleagues had previously shown (Das et al., 1998Das S. Sasaki Y.F. Rothe T. Premkumar L.S. Takasu M. Crandall J.E. Dikkes P. Connor D.A. Rayudu P.V. Cheung W. et al.Nature. 1998; 393: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, Sasaki et al., 2002Sasaki Y.F. Rothe T. Premkumar L.S. Das S. Cui J. Wong H.-k. Sucher N.J. Zhang D. Nakanishi N. Lipton S.A. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 2052-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), NR3 subunits can render NMDARs much less sensitive to blockade by Mg2+, as was indeed found to the be case for the NMDARs on oligodendrocytes. Similarly, Lalo et al., 2006Lalo U. Pankratov Y. Kirchhoff F. North R.A. Verkhratsky A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2673-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar reported that the NMDAR-mediated currents of cortical astrocytes were also highly resistant to Mg2+ block, raising the possibility that NR3 subunits may contribute to those functional receptors as well. But additional dogmas and myths form a virtual shroud over the story of NMDARs in clinical medicine. Long before NMDARs were shown to be on oligodendrocytes, the neurological community had very high hopes of relieving damage to neurons after publication of the landmark 1984 publication of Roger Simon, Brian Meldrum, and colleagues (Simon et al., 1984Simon R.P. Swan J.H. Griffiths T. Meldrum B.S. Science. 1984; 226: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar) showing that excessive NMDAR activity underlays ischemic damage. However, the myth arose that all NMDAR antagonists failed in clinical trials. This misinformation was then followed by the myth that the failure of clinical trials occurred because white matter did not have NMDARs; hence, NMDAR antagonists were said not to be useful in preventing ischemic damage because white matter (axons and their surrounding myelin sheaths) and astrocytes are injured in addition to gray matter (neurons). In actuality, most NMDAR antagonists failed in clinical trials because they could not be tolerated by humans at neuroprotective doses (Lipton, 2006Lipton S.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Many basic science and clinical studies did not even use neuroprotective doses of NMDARs, because such doses proved to be too toxic or at least exhibited severe side effects. After all, the NMDAR is responsible for normal synaptic transmission contributing to long-term potentiation (LTP) and other important processes in many areas of the brain. Therefore, high-affinity, effective NMDAR antagonists block normal brain activity and lead to intolerable side effects, such as hallucinations, sleepiness, and even coma. In fact, what was needed was a more gentle type of NMDAR antagonist, one that relatively spared normal synaptic activity while blocking excessive (pathological, probably extrasynaptic) activity (Hardingham et al., 2002Hardingham G.E. Fukunaga Y. Bading H. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). One such example of a clinically tolerated NMDAR antagonist that has passed multiple clinical trials is memantine, which was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease and is also used clinically in Europe for vascular (multi-infarct or multiple stroke) dementia. While memantine may also interact with α7-nicotinic and 5HT3 channels, its major mode of action at clinically used concentrations is at the NMDAR (Lipton, 2006Lipton S.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Our group showed that memantine is clinically tolerated because of its mode of action on the NMDAR—it is an uncompetitive antagonist that acts as an open-channel blocker, and, most importantly, with a relatively fast “off rate.” This fast off rate is a critical factor contributing to its low-affinity mechanism of action and thus to its clinical tolerability; memantine prevents excessive NMDAR activity while not accumulating in NMDAR-operated channels. Hence, it does not block subsequent physiological neurotransmission. This mode of drug action has been termed “Pathologically-Activated Therapeutics” or PAT drugs, that is, a gentle tap compared to most high-affinity drugs that manifest severe side effects, as previously produced by Big Pharma (Lipton, 2006Lipton S.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Another misconception arose recently when memantine was shown to have only a modest effect on rodent models of cerebral ischemia; in contrast, blocking Ca2+ influx occurring via acid-sensing channels (ASICs) was more effective (Xiong et al., 2004Xiong Z.G. Zhu X.M. Chu X.P. Minami M. Hey J. Wei W.L. MacDonald J.F. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Simon R.P. Cell. 2004; 118: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). However, that report used a submaximal dose of memantine, so the full neuroprotective yet clinically tolerated action of the drug was not achieved (Chen et al., 1998Chen H.-S.V. Wang Y.F. Rayudu P.Y. Edgecomb P. Neill J.C. Segal M.M. Lipton S.A. Jensen F.E. Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In point of fact, a more recent publication in Neuron has shown that NMDARs may be very important in neuronal cell death from ischemia because excessive NMDAR activity leads to phosphorylation and thus activation of ASICs (Gao et al., 2005Gao J. Duan B. Wang D.-G. Deng X.-H. Zhang G.-Y. Xu L. Xu T.-L. Neuron. 2005; 48: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, both types of channels are important, and these new studies converge to the contrarian view that NMDARs may be even more critical in cerebral ischemia and other neurodegenerative disorders than appreciated in recent years, bringing us full-circle back to the original view espoused in 1984 (Simon et al., 1984Simon R.P. Swan J.H. Griffiths T. Meldrum B.S. Science. 1984; 226: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). For some, this may conjure up an Orwellian image of NMDARs controlling the fate of neurons and glia, especially because of the date of that initial publication. In contrast, others will express a new sense of optimism that the recent, albeit modest, clinical success of memantine in Alzheimer's disease may in fact lead to similar treatment of cerebral ischemia, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, glaucoma, and therefore both white matter and gray matter diseases with NMDAR antagonists. Time will tell if this premise holds true, but at a minimum we can say that clinical neurologists are excited by these prospects (although hopefully not overly excited, so as to avoid excitotoxic damage in their own thinking). As a challenge for the future, the new work shows that white matter (oligodendrocytes and myelin) contain NMDARs with NR3A subunits. NR3 subunits can change the properties of NMDARs—rendering the channels much less sensitive to Mg2+ blockade and therefore potentially active even at the resting membrane potential. Currently, there are no selective agonists or antagonists for NR3 subunits. It will be important for future basic science studies and possible clinical interventions to further elucidate the properties of receptors containing NR3 subunits and to develop appropriate drugs to selectively and specifically interact with these receptors. And concerning dogmas, we must continue to challenge and reinterpret our findings with an open mind, a passionate heart, and an inquiring intellect. Dr. Lipton has no direct ownership in the drugs mentioned in this article. Under Harvard University rules, he does participate in a royalty sharing plan administered by Harvard Medical School and Children's Hospital, Boston, as the inventor on patents for the use of memantine in neurodegenerative disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2167373140,"Carbohydrate recognition is central to the biological and industrial exploitation of plant structural polysaccharides. These insoluble polymers are recalcitrant to microbial degradation, and enzymes that catalyze this process generally contain non-catalytic carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) that potentiate activity by increasing substrate binding. Agarose, a repeat of the disaccharide 3,6-anhydro-α-l-galactose-(1,3)-β-d-galactopyranose-(1,4), is the dominant matrix polysaccharide in marine algae, yet the role of CBMs in the hydrolysis of this important polymer has not previously been explored. Here we show that family 6 CBMs, present in two different β-agarases, bind specifically to the non-reducing end of agarose chains, recognizing only the first repeat of the disaccharide. The crystal structure of one of these modules Aga16B-CBM6-2, in complex with neoagarohexaose, reveals the mechanism by which the protein displays exquisite specificity, targeting the equatorial O4 and the axial O3 of the anhydro-l-galactose. Targeting of the CBM6 to the non-reducing end of agarose chains may direct the appended catalytic modules to areas of the plant cell wall attacked by β-agarases where the matrix polysaccharide is likely to be more amenable to further enzymic hydrolysis.

The polysaccharides in the cell wall of both marine and terrestrial plants represent the most abundant reservoir of organic carbon in the biosphere. The microbial hydrolysis of these polymers is not only central to the carbon cycle but also of considerable industrial significance. Indeed, the enzymes that catalyze this process are already widely used in the paper/pulp, animal feed, fruit juice, detergent, and textile sectors (1Subramaniyan S. Prema P. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 33-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 2Warren R.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 183-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 3Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 211-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major potential industrial application for these enzymes is, however, the conversion of the energy stored in plant structural polysaccharides, estimated to be equivalent to 600 billion barrels of oil, into bioethanol, a renewable and environmentally friendly fuel (4Boudet A.M. Kajita S. Grima-Pettenati J. Goffner D. Trends Plant. Sci. 2003; 8: 576-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The complex interactions between the polysaccharides within the plant cell wall restrict their accessibility to enzyme attack. To overcome this problem glycoside hydrolases that degrade the plant cell wall often have a complex molecular architecture comprising both catalytic domains and non-catalytic carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) 3The abbreviations used are: CBM, carbohydrate binding module; GH, glycoside hydrolase; SeMet, selenomethionine. (5Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). By binding to plant structural polysaccharides, CBMs bring the appended catalytic domain into intimate contact with its target substrate and potentiate catalysis (6Tomme P. Van Tilbeurgh H.

A recent study also showed that a CBM, which is not appended to a catalytic module, is able to increase substrate access by disrupting the crystalline structure of the polysaccharide chitin (11Vaaje-Kolstad G.

CBMs are currently grouped into 45 sequence-based families (5Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar, 12Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. 1999; (Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge): 3-12Google Scholar), analogous to the classification of the catalytic modules of these enzymes into glycoside hydrolase families (GHs) (13Henrissat B. Teeri T.T. Warren R.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) (available at afmb.cnrsmrs.fr/CAZY). CBM families, such as 1, 2a, 3a, 5, and 10, contain “type A” modules, which bind to crystalline polysaccharides. The ligand specificity of the different members of these families is highly conserved (9Gill J. Rixon J.E. Bolam D.N. McQueen-Mason S. Simpson P.J. Williamson M.P. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J.

J. 1990; 272: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). By contrast, type B and type C CBMs, where the proteins typically interact with single saccharide chains either internally or at the termini, respectively, generally recognize polysaccharides that are hydrolyzed by the appended catalytic module (17Boraston A.B. Nurizzo D. Notenboom V. Ducros V. Rose D.R. Kilburn D.G. Davies G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Abou Hachem M. Nordberg Karlsson E.

Ligand specificity in type B and C CBM families is highly variable: for example, CBM family 4 (CBM4) contains proteins that bind to amorphous cellulose (β-1,4-glucans), xylan (β-1,4-xylose polymers), and laminarin (β-1,3-glucans) (17Boraston A.B.

CBM6 represents one of the most extensive families with members present in enzymes that display a range of different activities (19Henshaw J.L. Bolam D.N. Pires V.M. Czjzek M. Henrissat B.

This fold comprises two β-sheets, one of which presents a concave surface. Although the ligand binds to the concave β-sheet in the majority of CBM families with this fold, the site of saccharide recognition varies in different members of CBM6. In the laminarase- and xylanase-derived CBM6s the ligand binding site is located within the loops connecting the two β-sheets (20Czjzek M. Bolam D.N. Mosbah A. Allouch J. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M.

Thus, not only does the ligand binding site vary in CBM6, but the family contains “type B” (for example, CtXyl-CBM6 and CsXyl-CBM6) binding sites, while CmCBM6–2 displays both type B and type C ligand binding modes. Agarose is an important marine linear polysaccharide of molecular weight ∼120,000 (24Labropoulos K.C. Niesz D.E. Danforth S.C. Kevrekidis P.G. Carbohydr. Polym. 2002; 50: 393-406Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar), based on the repeating unit 3,6-anhydro-α-l-galactose-(1,3)-β-d-galactopyranose-(1,4) (Fig. 1) (25Allouch J. Helbert W. Henrissat B. Czjzek M. Structure. 2004; 12: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The polysaccharide forms a double helical paracrystalline structure, which is highly recalcitrant to enzyme attack (26Arnott S. Fulmer A. Scott W.E. Dea I.C. Moorhouse R. Rees D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 90: 269-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The agarose backbone is hydrolyzed by α- and β-agarases, which cleave the α-1,3- and β-1,4-glycosidic bonds, respectively (25Allouch J. Helbert W. Henrissat B. Czjzek M. Structure. 2004; 12: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The vast majority of agarases described in the literature act on β-glycosidic bonds (β-agarases), whereas there are only three enzymes (all in glycoside hydrolase family 96) in the CAZY data base (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/) that are classified as α-agarases. The mechanism by which these enzymes are able to access single agarose chains is currently unclear, although the recent description of the crystal structure of a β-agarase reveals an auxiliary agarose binding site in the catalytic module that may contribute to local unwinding of the double helical structure (25Allouch J. Helbert W. Henrissat B. Czjzek M. Structure. 2004; 12: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although several CBM6s are located in β-agarases, their functional significance is unclear. Here we show that three family 6 CBMs located in two Saccharophagus degradans β-agarases, Aga16B and Aga86E (so called because they contain catalytic modules belonging to glycoside hydrolase families 16 and 86, respectively), bind to the non-reducing end of single agarose chains. The crystal structure of one of these CBMs in complex with neoagarooligosaccharides reveals that, despite a paucity of hydrogen bonds between ligand and protein, the exploitation of the hydroxyls that are unique to the 3,6-anhydro-α-l-galactose-(1,3)-β-d-galactopyranose-(1,4) repeating unit of agarose as recognition determinants contributes to the exquisite specificity displayed by these protein modules for the marine polysaccharide. The functional significance of the binding mode of these CBM6s is discussed. Protein Expression and Purification—The DNA sequences encoding the Aga16B and Aga86E family 6 CBMs were amplified by PCR from plasmids containing aga16B and aga86E, respectively, using the thermostable DNA polymerases Pfx (Invitrogen, amplified aga16B) or Pfu Turbo (Stratagene, amplified aga86E) and the primers listed in Table S1 (supplemental material). The amplified DNA from aga86E was cloned into NdeI- and XhoI-restricted pET22b to generate pJH1 (Aga86E-CBM6-1), pJH2 (Aga86E-CBM6-2), and pJH3 (Aga86E-CBM6-3). Amplified DNA encoding the CBM6 modules of Aga16B was ligated into NheI- and HindIII-digested pET28a to generate pJH4 (Aga16B-CBM6-1) and pJH5 (Aga16B-CBM6-2), respectively (Fig. 2). The encoded recombinant proteins, which contain a C-terminal His6 tag, were expressed in Escherichia coli strains TUNER (Novagen, Aga86E-derived CBMs) or BL21 STAR DE3 (Aga16B-derived CBMs), harboring the appropriate recombinant plasmid. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C to mid exponential phase (A600 ∼0.7), isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 200 μm, and the cells were incubated for a further 16 h at 16 °C. The bacteria were harvested and fractionated to produce cell-free extract and insoluble fractions. The His6-tagged recombinant proteins in the insoluble fraction were redissolved in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer containing 500 mm NaCl (Buffer A) and 6 m urea and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The bound protein was refolded on the immobilized nickel metal ion column by washing the matrix with a step gradient of 6 to 0 m urea in Buffer A. The refolded protein was eluted using a 0 to 300 mm imidazole gradient in Buffer A. To generate selenomethionine (SeMet) Aga16B-CBM6-2 the E. coli methionine auxotroph B834(DE3) was cultured as described in Carvalho et al. (27Carvalho A.L. Goyal A. Prates J.A. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Pires V.M. Ferreira L.M. Planas A. Romao M.J. Fontes C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34785-34793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and the protein was purified using the same procedures employed for the native CBM6s, except 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol was included in all buffers. For crystallization experiments Aga16B-CBM6-2 was concentrated using an Amicon 10-kDa molecular mass centrifugal concentrator and washed three times in 5 mm dithiothreitol (for the SeMet proteins) or water (for the native proteins). Generation of CBM6 Mutants—Mutants of Aga16B-CBM6-2 were generated using the PCR-based QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions, employing pJH5 as the template DNA and the primers listed in Table 1S. To investigate the ligand-binding site of the protein, the mutant W97M was generated. To assist in solving the crystal structure of the protein, five methionine mutants (I5M, A65M, V69M, L77M, and L131M) were produced, because the native CBM6 does not contain any methionine residues. These mutants were combined in various permutations, and we used the I5M/L77M double mutant to solve the crystal structure of the protein. Source of Sugars Used—Agarose, oat spelt xylan, laminarin, hydroxyethylcellulose, and neoagarooligosaccharides were obtained from Sigma, pustulan was from Calbiochem, and cellooligosaccharides were from Seikagaku Corp. (Japan). All other sugars were purchased from Megazyme International (Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland). Reduced neoagarohexaose was prepared by incubating the oligosaccharide with sodium borohydride as described previously (28Proctor M.R. Taylor E.J. Nurizzo D. Turkenburg J.P. Lloyd R.M. Vardakou M. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2697-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Ligand Binding Studies—The qualitative binding of the CBM6 proteins to soluble polysaccharides was assessed by affinity gel electrophoresis, as described previously (29Freelove A.C. Bolam D.N. White P. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43010-43017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To incorporate agarose, the polysaccharide (10% w/v) was solubilized by boiling and then added to the polyacrylamide gels prior to polymerization. Ligand binding was also assessed by isothermal titration calorimetry. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements were made at 25 °C following standard procedures (19Henshaw J.L. Bolam D.N. Pires V.M. Czjzek M. Henrissat B. Ferreira L.M. Fontes C.M. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21552-21559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) using a MicroCal Omega titration calorimeter. Proteins were dialyzed, extensively, against 50 mm sodium Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm CaCl2, and the ligand was dissolved in the same buffer to minimize heats of dilution. During a titration experiment the protein sample (40–250 μm), stirred at 300 rpm in a 1.4331-ml reaction cell maintained at 25 °C, was injected with a single 1-μl aliquot, followed by 29 successive 10-μl injections of oligosaccharide ligand (0.5–5 mm) at 200-s intervals. Integrated heat effects, after correction for heats of dilution, were analyzed by non-linear regression using a single-site binding model (MicroCal Origin, version 7.0). The fitted data yielded the association constant (KA) and the enthalpy of binding (ΔH). Other thermodynamic parameters were calculated using the standard thermodynamic equation: –RT ln KA =ΔG =ΔH – TΔS. To investigate the role of calcium in ligand binding the metal was removed with 10 mm EDTA. Structure Solution and Crystallization of Aga16B-CBM6-2—Large single diffraction quality crystals of both the native protein and the I5M/L77M mutant were obtained by the hanging drop, vapor diffusion method with a mother liquor of 2 m NaCl and 16–20% polyethylene glycol 4000 buffered to pH 7.5 with 100 mm Tris/HCl. The protein was used at concentration of 30 mg/ml and co-crystallized with an excess (∼5 mm) of neoagarohexaose, and drops were formed using 1 μl of protein and 1 μl of well solution. The crystals, which formed overnight at 18 °C, were harvested in rayon fiber loops with cryoprotection provided by short soaks in mother liquor supplemented with 10–15% ethylene glycol before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of native Aga16BCBM6-2 co-crystallized with neoagarohexaose and soaked in cryoprotectant were mounted on the detector and frozen directly in the nitrogen stream at 113 K. The 1.6-Å resolution data were collected with a Rigaku R-AXIS 4++ area detector coupled to an MM-002 x-ray generator with Osmic “blue” optics. Data were processed using the Crystal Clear/d*trek software provided with the instrument (30Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Three wavelength multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility on beamline ID-23.1 using a Marmosaic 225 charge-coupled device detector. The appropriate wavelengths for data collection were determined using a fluorescence detector. Data (180°) were collected with Δφ of 0.5° and processed using MOSFLM (32Leslie A.G.W.

Structure Solution, Model Building, and Refinement—The structure of the SeMet-labeled Aga16BCBM6-2 I5M/L77M mutant was determined using multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing; selenium positions were determined using SHELXD, and density modification was carried out in SHELXE (34Sheldrick G. Schneider T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). Data were prepared for input into SHELXD with SHELXC. An initial model was built automatically with ARP/wARP followed by successive rounds of model building/correction and refinement with COOT (35Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

This essentially complete, but preliminary model was used as a starting point for model correction and refinement against the high resolution native data set.

Production of Agarase-derived CBM6s—The β-agarases Aga86E and Aga16B from S. degradans are modular enzymes containing a GH86 and GH16 catalytic module appended to three and two CBM6s, respectively (Fig. 2). To explore the function of these CBMs, attempts were made to express these modules in E. coli. All of these CBMs could be produced as insoluble inclusion bodies. Of these all except Aga16B-CBM6-1 could be refolded by removal of urea (∼70% solubilization) and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Ligand Specificity of Agarase-derived CBM6s—The capacity of the CBM6s to bind to polysaccharides was explored by affinity gel electrophoresis. The data revealed no electrophoretic retardation of the three modules in the presence of soluble cellulose, xylans, mannans, pectins, and agarose (data not shown). Despite its apparent inability to bind solubilized agarose, initial UV difference experiments (data not shown) suggested that Aga16B-CBM6-2 binds neoagarobiose in the presence of calcium, prompting further exploration of neoagarooligosaccharide binding by isothermal titration calorimetry. Example data are displayed in Fig. 3, and the full data set is presented in Table 2. Although Aga86E-CBM6-3 did not recognize these ligands, the other three modules bound to neoagarobiose, neoagarotetraose, and neoagarohexaose, which comprise one two and three repeats of the disaccharide repeating unit of agarose, 3,6-anhydro-α-l-galactose-(1,3)-β-d-galactopyranose-(1,4) (Fig. 1), respectively. d-Galactose and 3,6-anhydro-l-galactose did not interact with the CBM6s. The affinities of the three ligands for each of the CBMs were similar, with a KA of ∼105. The experimental stoichiometries were ∼1 indicating that each of the refolded CBMs contains a single ligand binding site. Oligosaccharide binding was enthalpically driven while the change in entropy had a detrimental influence on affinity. The thermodynamics of ligand binding displayed by the three modules is typical of the interaction of CBMs with soluble ligands, and the possible mechanisms for this loss in entropy and increase in enthalpy have been extensively discussed previously (38Boraston A.B.

https://openalex.org/W1966491286,"The folding and activation of furin occur through two pH- and compartment-specific autoproteolytic steps. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), profurin folds under the guidance of its prodomain and undergoes an autoproteolytic excision at the consensus furin site Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg107/ generating an enzymatically masked furin-propeptide complex competent for transport to late secretory compartments. In the mildly acidic environment of the trans-Golgi network/endosomal system, the bound propeptide is cleaved at the internal site 69HRGVTKR75/, unmasking active furin capable of cleaving substrates in trans. Here, by using cellular, biochemical, and modeling studies, we demonstrate that the conserved His69 is a pH sensor that regulates the compartment-specific cleavages of the propeptide. In the ER, unprotonated His69 stabilizes a solvent-accessible hydrophobic pocket necessary for autoproteolytic excision at Arg107. Profurin molecules unable to form the hydrophobic pocket, and hence, the furin-propeptide complex, are restricted to the ER by a PACS-2- and COPI-dependent mechanism. Once exposed to the acidic pH of the late secretory pathway, protonated His69 disrupts the hydrophobic pocket, resulting in exposure and cleavage of the internal cleavage site at Arg75 to unmask the enzyme. Together, our data explain the pH-regulated activation of furin and how this His-dependent regulatory mechanism is a model for other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2102922226,"Previous work has shown that channels formed by both connexin (Cx)26 and Cx32 (heteromeric Cx26/Cx32 hemichannels) are selectively permeable to cAMP and cGMP. To further investigate differential connexin channel permeability among second messengers, and the influence of connexin channel composition on the selectivity, the permeability of inositol phosphates with one to four phosphate groups through homomeric Cx26, homomeric Cx32, and heteromeric Cx26/Cx32 channels was examined. Connexin channels were purified from transfected HeLa cells and from rat, mouse, and guinea pig livers, resulting in channels with a broad range of Cx26/Cx32 aggregate ratios. Permeability to inositol phosphates was assessed by flux through reconstituted channels. Surprisingly, myoinositol and all inositol phosphates tested were permeable through homomeric Cx32 and homomeric Cx26 channels. Even more surprising, heteromeric Cx26/Cx32 channels showed striking differences in permeability among inositol phosphates with three or four phosphate groups and among isomers of inositol triphosphate. Thus, heteromeric channels are selectively permeable among inositol phosphates, whereas the corresponding homomeric channels are not. There was no discernible difference in the permeability of channels with similar Cx26/Cx32 ratios purified from native and heterologous sources. The molecular selectivity of heteromeric channels among three inositol triphosphates could not be accounted for by simple connexin isoform stoichiometry distributions and therefore may depend on specific isoform radial arrangements within the hexameric channels.

Connexin channels, which compose most vertebrate gap junctions, mediate direct intercellular movement of ions and molecules.

Heteromeric mixing of different connexin isoforms, producing variation in channel stoichiometry and/or arrangements of isoforms within the hemichannels, may allow cells to dynamically regulate their intercellular communication properties, including molecular selectivity.

We have reported previously the molecular selectivity between cAMP and cGMP by heteromeric Cx26/Cx32 channels (20Locke D. Stein T. Davies C. Morris J. Harris A.L. Evans W.H. Monaghan P. Gusterson B. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 643-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Bevans C.G. Kordel M. Rhee S.K. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2808-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Specifically, we found that in populations of native heteromeric channels, composed of channels with a range of isoform stoichiometries and arrangements, some of the channels were permeable to cAMP, and a much larger fraction of the channels was permeable to cGMP. This selectivity between highly similar biological signaling molecules was unanticipated from dye permeability studies of these channels. The ability of connexin channels to discriminate among second messengers is likely to be a biologically important property. Therefore, we asked whether the selective permeability among second messengers extended to inositol phosphates (IPs). IP permeability is difficult to assess in cells because of the biological effects of manipulation of the levels of these compounds and their short lifetimes in cytoplasm. For example, the lifetime of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate ((1,4,5)-IP3) in cytoplasm ranges from 9 to 60 s, depending on cell type (26Wang S.S. Alousi A.A. Thompson S.H. J. Gen.

For this reason, we utilized a well characterized liposome-based technique for assessing permeability of functional connexin channels (20Locke D. Stein T. Davies C. Morris J. Harris A.L. Evans W.H.

Permeability to each IP was determined by direct assessment of its loss and/or retention in liposomes containing functional connexin channels. In this way, the identity of the permeable molecular species was unambiguously determined. The use of IPs as permeability tracers has several advantages. First, they are endogenous cytoplasmic molecules available for permeation through gap junction channels in vivo. Second, several IPs, in addition to (1,4,5)-IP3, have been shown to be biologically active (35Cullen P.J. Irvine R.F. Dawson A.P. Biochem.

Third, the availability of IPs with different numbers of phosphate groups at several positions around the inositol ring allows exploration of the structural correlates of any selective permeability observed. To reveal the effect of connexin channel composition on the selective permeability, two strategies were employed to obtain homomeric Cx26 and Cx32 channel populations, and heteromeric channel populations with a wide range of aggregate ratios of the two connexins, from both native and heterologous sources. We report here the surprising ability of heteromeric, but not homomeric, connexin channels to distinguish among biologically active IPs, including those with the same molecular weight and charge. The selectivity is not a simple function of the content of one or the other of the connexins but is a function of the heteromeric character of the channels. This has clear implications for the biological role of heteromeric channels and for modulation of intercellular molecular signaling. Components of the “Tet-On” connexin expression system (30Koreen I.V. Elsayed W.A. Liu Y.J. Harris A.L. Biochem.

Lipids (egg phosphatidylcholine, bovine brain phosphatidylserine, and lissamine rhodamine B-labeled egg phosphatidylethanolamine (rhodamine-PE)) were from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, IL). n-Octyl-β-d-glucoside (OG; purity ≤ 99.5%) was from Glycon Biochemicals (Luckenwalde, Germany). Bio-Gel gel filtration matrix (A-0.5m, 100–200 mesh, exclusion limit 500 kDa) was from Bio-Rad. Myoinositol and inositol phosphates were from Echelon (Salt Lake City, UT), except (1,4,5)-IP3 and (1,4,6)-IP3, which were from Alexis (San Diego, CA).

Secondary antibodies for Western blotting and the BioTrak TRK assay kit to measure (1,4,5)-IP3 were from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Expression of Tagged Connexin Channels in HeLa Cells—Bi-directional tetracycline-responsive expression vectors (Clontech), containing one or two multiple cloning sites, were used to express homomeric or heteromeric connexin channels in HeLa cells, which have virtually no endogenous connexin expression (43Mesnil M. Krutovskikh V. Piccoli C. Elfgang C. Traub O. Willecke K. Yamasaki H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 629-639PubMed Google Scholar). For expression of homomeric channels, rat (r) Cx26 or Cx32 coding sequences were subcloned into one cloning site in-frame with a sequence coding for a carboxyl-terminal (CT) tag consisting of a thrombin cleavage site followed by a hemagglutinin epitope (not His-Ala) and (His-Asn)6, i.e. a HA(HN)6 tag. When both cloning sites contained different connexin coding sequences, only one connexin was tagged. “Tet-On” cell lines were maintained in 200 μg/ml hygromycin and 100 μg/ml G418. Channels are designated as Cx26Tag or Cx32Tag when homomeric and designated as Cx26Tag/Cx32 or Cx26/Cx32Tag when heteromeric. Purification of Tagged Connexin Channels—Cells at 35% confluence in four 500-cm2 dishes were induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 48 h, during which time the expressed connexin(s) formed functional gap junctions as the cells became confluent (30Koreen I.V.

The supernatant (100,000 × gav for 30 min at 4 °C) was incubated with 0.25 ml of agarose-immobilized anti-HA mouse IgG overnight at 4 °C with shaking. The antibody matrix was collected at 700 × gav for 1 min at 4 °C and washed in a fritted column with 20 ml of 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, 1 m NaCl, 80 mm OG, 1 mg/ml azolectin, pH 7.4, followed by 20 ml of the same solution containing only 138 mm NaCl. Hemichannels were eluted with 50 mm CH3COOH·Na, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 80 mm OG, pH 4.0, and 0.6-ml fractions were collected into 0.05 ml of 1 m NaHCO3, 10 mm KCl, 80 mm OG, pH 9.0. The final pH was ∼7.4. Tag Cleavage—Purified protein (200 μl) was incubated with 2 units of restriction grade thrombin (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) for 18 h at 4 °C (30Koreen I.V. Elsayed W.A. Liu Y.J. Harris A.L. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Tag cleavage leaves four extra amino acids at the CT (Leu-Val-Pro-Arg) part of the cleavage site. For these studies, there was no statistical difference in permeability of any of the compounds tested between tagged and tag-cleaved channels (p < 0.05; n = 5). Purification of Cx26 and/or Cx32 Channels from Rodent Livers—Mouse (m), guinea pig (gp), and rat (r) hemichannels were immunopurified from rodent livers using methods established previously (21Bevans C.G.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, a crude plasma membrane fraction was prepared from Polytron and Dounce homogenate of liver in 5 mm NaHCO3, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, pH 8.0. A low speed pellet (11,000 × gav for 30 min) was washed by centrifugation (25,000 × gav for 20 min) in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 0.75 mg/ml azolectin, pH 7.5. The pellet was solubilized in 80 mm OG (final concentration; 80 ml final volume). The supernatant (100,000 × gav) was incubated with 0.6 ml of Sepharose-conjugated M12.13 anti-Cx32 monoclonal mouse antibody (42Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Jesaitis L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1817-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Bead washing and connexin elution were carried out as described for tagged connexins. From solubilized mouse and guinea pig membranes, the channels purified are heteromeric Cx26/Cx32. The proportion of Cx26 recovered is greater from guinea pig than from mouse livers, consistent with the composition in the livers themselves (46Traub O. Look J. Dermietzel R. Brummer F. Hulser D.

Obtaining Different Aggregate Cx26/Cx32 Ratios from Native Tissue—To obtain different ratios from a single native source, we took advantage of the fact that purification was on the basis of the presence of Cx32. After the connexin was bound to the anti-Cx32 immunobeads, we found that the earliest elution fractions contained the highest proportion of Cx26, presumably due to the lower number of Cx32 epitopes per channel. For example, from solubilized rat liver membranes, the bulk of connexin channels purified are homomeric rCx32. However, when small (∼200 μl) elution fractions are used instead of the usual ∼600-μl fractions, the first several fractions contained heteromeric rCx26/Cx32 channels with significant Cx26 content, which elute more easily from the antibody matrix. The later fractions contain only homomeric rCx32 channels. This allows a range of isoform stoichiometries to be obtained from a single native source. Channel Reconstitution—Immunopurified connexins (∼1 mg/ml connexin in 80 mm OG, 459 mm urea, and 10 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine/rhodamine-PE at a molar ratio of 2:1:0.01; 200 μl) were reconstituted into unilamellar liposomes using a glass HR10/30 chromatography column (bed volume ∼24 ml) packed with Bio-Gel A-0.5m 100–200 mesh media (exclusion limit 500 kDa) in chilled, degassed 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 459 mm urea (500 mosm/kg). This solution is referred to below as “urea buffer.” Flow rate was 9 ml/h, and connexin proteoliposomes were eluted in the column void volume. Transport-specific Fractionation Activity Assay—Transport-specific fractionation (TSF) was used to assess the molecular selectivity of reconstituted connexin hemichannels (21Bevans C.G. Kordel M. Rhee S.K. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2808-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 28Harris A.L. Walter A. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr.

Walter A. Paul D. Goodenough D.A. Zimmerberg J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). TSF fractionates liposomes containing reconstituted connexin channels into two populations within an iso-osmolar density gradient, based on channel functionality. Fractionation is based on channel permeability to urea and sucrose, uncharged solutes that permeate open connexin channels and have different density at iso-osmolar concentrations (459 mm urea or 400 mm sucrose; 500 mosm/kg). Equilibration of these solutes across the liposome through an open hemichannel occurs rapidly and increases the density of the liposome. TSF therefore reports all-or-nothing permeation of urea and sucrose through connexin channels on a per liposome basis. Other entrapped molecules that are permeable through the channels will be lost from the liposomes during the TSF spin. This means that when the tracer/liposome ratio for liposomes with channels (TSF lower band) is less that that for liposomes without channels (TSF upper band), the difference reflects the number of liposomes in the former population that have channels permeable to the tracer. Fractionation of liposomes into bands is monitored by the fluorescence of rhodamine-PE (λex 570 nm and λem 590 nm) in the liposome membrane. Typically, TSF uses linear iso-osmotic gradients and centrifugation at 37 °C (20Locke D. Stein T. Davies C. Morris J. Harris A.L. Evans W.H. Monaghan P. Gusterson B. Exp.

However, for these studies, step iso-osmolar density gradients were formed at 4 °C in Beckman SW60Ti 4.4 ml ultracentrifuge tubes (Fig. 1). The buffer solutions were the urea buffer mentioned above and “sucrose buffer,” in which the urea was osmotically replaced with sucrose. The step gradients were composed, from the bottom up, of 1.4 ml of 10:90 urea/sucrose mixed buffers, 2 ml of 55:45 urea/sucrose mixed buffers, and 0.4 ml of 90:10 urea/sucrose mixed buffers (all v/v). An aliquot, typically 400 μl, of connexin proteoliposomes loaded with tracer molecules by gel filtration (see below) was layered onto each gradient. Gradients were centrifuged at 300,000 × gav for 3 h at 4°C. Liposomes impermeable to sucrose are buoyed by the lighter entrapped urea, banding at the interface between the upper two layers. Liposomes containing functional channels continuously equilibrate the internal and external solution, moving to a position in the gradient corresponding to the density of the liposome phospholipid membrane. These liposomes band at the interface between the middle and the bottom layer. Tracer permeability was assessed by direct comparison of tracers selectively lost or retained by the liposomes in the upper versus lower TSF bands. Tracer retention in the upper liposomes acts as an internal control for tracer loading and for nonspecific membrane leakage. Tracer Loading—Tracers used for this study were d-myoinositol, inositol 1-monophosphate (1-IP), inositol 1,4-diphosphate ((1,4)-IP2), (1,4,5)-IP3, inositol 1,4,6-triphosphate ((1,4,6)-IP3), inositol 1,3,4-triphosphate ((1,3,4)-IP3), and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate ((1,3,4,5)-IP4). Test compounds (100 μm myoinositol or inositol phosphates) were loaded during liposome formation by gel filtration. The liposome-forming solution contained the 100 μm inositol or IPs, as did 2 ml of urea buffer loaded onto the gel filtration column preceding the liposome-forming solution, and 0.5 ml of the same solution was added immediately following the liposome-forming solution. Each gel filtration column was calibrated to determine the position where liposomes elute (column void volume). Unentrapped and connexin channel-permeable tracers elute in the excluded volume well after the liposomes, as established by trapping MPTS (538 Da, z –3, λex 404 nm and λem 430 nm; data not shown), which has similar molecular weight and charge as IP3 isomers. Nonspecific binding of test compounds to liposomes was assessed by incubation of an aliquot of unloaded proteoliposomes with 100 μm of each test compound overnight followed by removal of unbound material by passage through a smaller (0.5 × 10 cm inner diameter) column containing Bio-Gel A-1.5m gel filtration matrix. Tracer Recovery—Upper and lower liposome bands in ∼100-μl volumes recovered from TSF density gradients were analyzed for myoinositol or inositol phosphate content. Liposomes were diluted 1:1 v/v with high pressure liquid chromatography-grade methanol and vortexed. The mixture was slowly passed through a Sep-Pak tC18 solid phase extraction cartridge (Waters Associates), pre-equilibrated in methanol, followed by 50% v/v methanol in water to elute the tracer. These samples were dried under argon. As an index of lipid removal, fluorescent rhodamine-PE lipid was completely removed from tracer samples by this technique. Residual inositol or inositol phosphate did not bind to the tC18 matrix solid phase extraction cartridge, as quantitative recovery of unentrapped tracer mixed with liposomes versus untreated tracer samples was obtained (p 0.05; n = 3). Tracer Analysis, Enzymatic—Inositol phosphates were dephosphorylated to myoinositol, which was detected using the method of Maslanski et al."

https://openalex.org/W2073959208,"In Escherichia coli, secretory proteins (preproteins) are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane by the Sec system composed of a protein-conducting channel, SecYEG, and an ATP-dependent motor protein, SecA. After binding of the preprotein to SecYEG-bound SecA, cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis by SecA are thought to drive the stepwise translocation of the preprotein across the membrane. To address how the length of a preprotein substrate affects the SecA-driven translocation process, we constructed derivatives of the precursor of the outer membrane protein A (proOmpA) with 2, 4, 6, and 8 in-tandem repeats of the periplasmic domain. With increasing polypeptide length, an increasing delay in the time before full-length translocation was observed, but the translocation rate expressed as amino acid translocation per minute remained constant. These data indicate that in the ATP-dependent reaction, SecA drives a constant rate of preprotein translocation consistent with a stepping mechanism of translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2064981534,"Interactions between yeast Dnm1p, Mdv1p, and Fis1p are required to form fission complexes that catalyze division of the mitochondrial compartment. During the formation of mitochondrial fission complexes, the Dnm1p GTPase self-assembles into large multimeric complexes on the outer mitochondrial membrane that are visualized as punctate structures by fluorescent labeling. Although it is clear that Fis1p.Mdv1p complexes on mitochondria are required for the initial recruitment of Dnm1p, it is not clear whether Dnm1p puncta assemble before or after this recruitment step. Here we show that the minimum oligomeric form of cytoplasmic Dnm1p is a dimer. The middle domain mutant protein Dnm1G385Dp forms dimers in vivo but fails to assemble into punctate structures. However, this dimeric mutant stably interacts with Mdv1p on the outer mitochondrial membrane, demonstrating that assembly of stable Dnm1p multimers is not required for Dnm1p-Mdv1p association or for mitochondrial recruitment of Dnm1p. Dnm1G385Dp is reported to be a terminal dimer in vitro. We describe conditions that allow assembly of Dnm1G385Dp into functional fission complexes on mitochondria in vivo. Using these conditions, we demonstrate that multimerization of Dnm1p is required to promote reorganization of Mdv1p from a uniform mitochondrial localization into punctate fission complexes. Our studies also reveal that Fis1p is present in these assembled fission complexes. Based on our results, we propose that Dnm1p dimers are initially recruited to the membrane via interaction with Mdv1p.Fis1p complexes. These dimers then assemble into multimers that subsequently promote the reorganization of Mdv1p into punctate fission complexes."

Here we investigated the effect of phosphatidylinositol metabolism and modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, two regulatory mechanisms that have individually been suggested to function in biosynthetic traffic, on polarized traffic in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Overexpression of phosphatidylinositol 5-kinase (PI5K) increased actin comet frequency in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and concomitantly stimulated trans-Golgi network (TGN) to apical membrane delivery of the raft-associated protein influenza hemagglutinin (HA), but did not affect delivery of a non-raft-associated apical protein or a basolateral marker. Modulation of actin comet formation by pharmacologic means, by overexpression of the TGN-localized inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase Ocrl, or by blockade of Arp2/3 function had parallel effects on the rate of apical delivery of HA. Moreover, HA released from a TGN block was colocalized in transport carriers in association with PI5K and actin comets. Inhibition of Arp2/3 function in combination with microtubule depolymerization led to a virtual block in HA delivery, suggesting synergistic coordination of these cytoskeletal assemblies in membrane transport.

The maintenance of polarized cell function requires continuous active sorting and delivery of newly synthesized proteins and lipids to differentiated apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains. Tight junctions between the cells prevent the diffusion of surface proteins between these domains, but polarity is established and maintained largely by the selective delivery and recycling of proteins to their appropriate site of function. In polarized renal cells, it is thought that newly synthesized proteins are sorted initially at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 3The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; AV, adenovirus; DOX, doxycycline; endo H, endoglycosidase H; HA, hemagglutinin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; N-WASP, neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; PI5K; human phosphatidylinositol 5-kinase α isoform; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; PI4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.3The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; AV, adenovirus; DOX, doxycycline; endo H, endoglycosidase H; HA, hemagglutinin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; N-WASP, neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; PI5K; human phosphatidylinositol 5-kinase α isoform; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; PI4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. into distinct carriers destined for the apical or basolateral domain (1Schuck S.

Transport of some proteins to their ultimate destination may be indirect and include passage through endosomal compartments or the opposite surface domain (2Rodriguez-Boulan E. Kreitzer G. Müsch A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar).The sorting of individual proteins to the apical and basolateral cell surface domains is signal-mediated. Basolateral sorting signals generally reside in the cytoplasmically disposed regions of proteins, whereas glycan-, lipid-, and peptide-dependent signals have been identified that reside in the lumenal, membrane-associated, or cytoplasmic regions of distinct apically targeted proteins (2Rodriguez-Boulan E. Kreitzer G. Müsch A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Little is known about how the sorting machinery recognizes these diverse signals; however, a current model suggests that preferential incorporation of a subset of apical proteins, including those with glycosphingolipid anchors or sorting signals within their transmembrane domains, into glycolipid-enriched microdomains (lipid rafts) is important for their polarized delivery (1Schuck S.

However, it is conceivable that these effects are due to a downstream metabolite of PI4P, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Indeed, although there is only a small amount of this lipid that can be visualized in the Golgi complex (10Watt S.A. Kular G. Fleming I.N. Downes C.P. Lucocq J.M. Biochem.

Genet. 1995; 57: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar).Increases in PIP2 levels upon expression of PI5Ks leads to production of rapidly nucleating branches of actin filaments, termed actin comets, which are capable of propelling transport vesicles through the cytoplasm (16Taunton J. Rowning B.A. Coughlin M.L. Wu M. Moon R.T. Mitchison T.J. Larabell C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), a potent stimulator of actin nucleation via the Arp2/3 complex, is activated by PIP2 and transduces elevated PIP2 levels into an increased frequency of actin comets (17Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). N-WASP and Arp2/3 are localized to the Golgi complex (among other sites), and a link between actin comets and biosynthetic traffic has been previously suggested (18Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). However, the effects of manipulating PI5K or Arp2/3 activity on the fidelity or rate of biosynthetic transport have not been explored.Here we have examined the effect of increasing PIP2 synthesis on polarized biosynthetic traffic in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Expression of PI5K selectively stimulated the TGN to apical delivery of a raft-associated protein without affecting the overall polarity of delivery. Moreover, the effect of PIP2 appears to involve an Arp2/3-dependent pathway, as a dominant-negative inhibitor of Arp2/3 function selectively inhibited biosynthetic transport of this protein. MDCK cells overexpressing PI5K had markedly increased numbers of actin comets, and HA could be visualized at the tips of these structures. Disruption of actin comet formation together with microtubule depolymerization led to a nearly total blockade in apical delivery, suggesting a concerted role of these distinct cytoskeletal assemblies for efficient and polarized apical transport. Our data suggest that actin comets contribute selectively to the polarized delivery of apically destined transport containers enriched in lipid raft-associated cargo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA and Replication-defective Recombinant Adenoviruses—The α isoform of murine phosphatidylinositol 5-kinase (PI5K) cloned into the pAdtet vector was provided by Andreas Jeromin (Baylor University).

For measurements of intra-Golgi transport, kinetics of surface delivery, and surface polarity, cells were seeded at superconfluence in 12-mm transwells (0.4-μm pore; Costar, Cambridge, MA) for 2–4 days prior to infection with recombinant AVs at the following multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) (control AV, AV-PI5K, AV-W, and AV-WA, m.o.i. 100–250; AV-HA, AV-p75, and AV-VSV-G, m.o.i. 25–50) as described in Ref. 19Henkel J.R. Apodaca G. Altschuler Y. Hardy S. Weisz O.A. Mol. Biol.

Experiments were performed the following day.Indirect Immunofluorescence—MDCK cells grown on transwell filters or coverslips were infected with AVs at the indicated m.o.i. The following day, cells were rinsed once with PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, rinsed with PBS containing 10 mm glycine (PBS-G), then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS-G for 3 min at room temperature. After washing, nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation for 5 min in PBS-G containing 0.25% (w/v) ovalbumin. Coverslips were incubated for 30 min with monoclonal anti-HA tag antibody (1:500 dilution; Covance) followed by washing in blocking buffer. Cells were then incubated for 30 min with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor goat anti-mouse 488 (1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Rhodamine phalloidin (1:80; Invitrogen) was included in this step where indicated. After extensive washing, coverslips or filters were mounted onto slides. Filter-grown MDCK cells were fixed with formaldehyde using a pH-shift protocol and processed as described in Ref. 20Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar. Images were captured using a Leica TCS-SL confocal microscope equipped with argon and green and red helium neon lasers (Leica, Dearfield, IL). Images were taken with a ×100 (1.4 numerical aperture) plan apochromat oil objective. TIFF images were processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA).Intracellular Transport and Cell Surface Delivery Assays—AV-infected filter-grown MDCK cells were starved for 30 min and radiolabeled for 5–10 min (endoglycosidase H (endo H) kinetics) or 15–20 min (TGN to surface delivery) with 1 mCi/ml Tran-35S-label® (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). To measure endo H kinetics, cells were chased in bicarbonate-free modified Eagle's medium for the indicated periods, solubilized, and HA immunoprecipitated as previously described in Ref. 19Henkel J.R.

After collection of antibody-antigen complexes, samples were eluted, divided in half, and mock-treated or treated overnight with endo H prior to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. To measure TGN to surface delivery, radiolabeled cells were chased at 19 °C for 2 h unless otherwise indicated to stage newly synthesized membrane proteins in the TGN. The cells were then rapidly warmed to 32 or 37 °C as indicated. Apical delivery of HA was measured by trypsinization as described in Ref. 21Henkel J.R. Popovich J.L. Gibson G.A. Watkins S.C.

To quantitate surface delivery of p75NTR, cells were radiolabeled on 25-μl drops of sulfate-free medium containing 100 μCi of [35S]sulfate at 18 °C and the rate of surface delivery was assessed using domain selective biotinylation upon subsequent warmup to 37 °C (23Yeaman C. Burdick D. Muesch A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 237-245Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of HA, VSV-G, or p75 was performed using supernatants from cultured hybridomas (Fc125 from Dr. Thomas Braciale, University of Virginia; 8G5 from Dr. Douglas Lyles, Wake Forest University (24Lefrancois L.

The following day cells were infected with AVs (m.o.i. 100–250) encoding the indicated proteins, and incubated overnight with 0.25 ng/ml doxycycline (DOX) to partially suppress protein expression. The following morning DOX was removed by thorough washing. Cells were then pressure-injected with cDNA encoding GFP- or YFP-actin and were returned to culture for 5 h. Following that time the cells were imaged on an Olympus IX81 microscope using a ×100 Olympus UPlanApo objective (numerical aperture 1.35). Random fields containing fluorescent actin-expressing cells were imaged every 2 s for 4 min. Data were analyzed using acquisition software (Slidebook) to determine the percentage of cells with comets. Stable cells lines expressing fluorescent protein-tagged actin were generated using Lipofectamine 2000 and mixed populations were isolated by selection in G418. These cells were infected with AV-PI5K where indicated and used for the quantification of actin comets in cells treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 5 μg/ml), cytochalasin D (25 μg/ml), 1-butanol (1% v/v), and t-butyl alcohol (1% v/v).Visualization of Cargo Associated with Actin Comets—MDCK cells (3 × 105) were seeded onto coverslips in 12-well dishes. The following day the cells were co-infected with AVs encoding HA and either PI5K or control AV. After 8 h at 37 °C, the cells were incubated at 19 °C for 2.5 h to stage HA in the TGN. Dishes were then warmed to 37 °C for 0 or 30 min before fixation and processing for indirect immunofluorescence to detect HA, PI5K, and actin.RESULTSPI5K Selectively Stimulates Biosynthetic Delivery of an Apical Raft-associated Protein—We examined the effect of AV-mediated overexpression of murine PI5Kα on biosynthetic traffic in polarized MDCK cells. Overexpression of PI5K increased cellular levels of PIP2 by 2–3-fold (not shown) but did not alter intra-Golgi kinetics based on the quantitation of the rate of acquisition of resistance to endo H digestion of influenza HA (Fig. 1A). To examine the effect of PI5K on the kinetics of post-Golgi transport, we staged newly synthesized radiolabeled HA in the TGN at 19 °C, and using a cell surface trypsinization assay measured the rate of its delivery to the apical cell surface upon warming to 37 °C. Roughly 50% of the total HA expressed in control cells reached the apical membrane within 1 h (Fig. 1B). In contrast, HA delivery was markedly stimulated in cells overexpressing PI5K (∼67% at 1 h).We next examined the effect of PI5K on the TGN to surface transport kinetics of p75, an apical marker not known to associate with lipid rafts in MDCK cells (Fig. 1C), as well as on the basolateral marker VSV-G (Fig. 1D). PI5K had no effect on the biosynthetic delivery of either of these proteins. Thus, the stimulatory effect of PI5K on surface delivery appears to be selective for raft-associated proteins.Overexpression of Ocrl Selectively Inhibits Biosynthetic Delivery of Influenza HA—To examine whether stimulation of PIP2 synthesis in the TGN was responsible for the stimulatory effect of PI5K, we compared the effect of overexpressing the TGN-localized PIP2 5′-phosphatase Ocrl (or as a control, expressing a phosphatase-deficient mutant of Ocrl) on the delivery of HA and p75. Because overexpression of both wild type and mutant Ocrl slowed intra-Golgi transport as assessed by monitoring endo H kinetics, we used [35S]sulfate to selectively radiolabel proteins in the TGN. As shown in Fig. 1E, expression of wild type Ocrl inhibited TGN to apical delivery of HA, whereas mutant Ocrl had no effect. Consistent with the selective effect of PI5K on HA delivery, neither wild type nor mutant Ocrl affected the kinetics of p75 delivery (Fig. 1F).PI5K Stimulates the Formation of Actin Comets in MDCK Cells—Because PI5K-mediated actin comets have been implicated in the transport of raft-associated proteins (18Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), we asked whether actin comet-mediated propulsion of HA transport carriers could be responsible for the stimulated surface delivery we observed. First, we sought to determine the relationship between PI5K and actin in fixed cells. MDCK cells were infected with AV expressing PI5K, then fixed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence 16 h later. Actin filaments were visualized using rhodamine phalloidin and the HA epitope tag on PI5K was detected using a monoclonal mouse antibody. PI5K colocalized extensively with actin filaments in confocal sections of MDCK cells (Fig. 2A). This is consistent with previous reports that PI5K is found in actin-rich fractions isolated from thrombin-activated platelets (25Yang S.A. Carpenter C.L. Abrams C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42331-42336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Next, we used a live cell approach to determine whether PI5K stimulates the formation of actin comets. Actin comets have not previously been reported in MDCK cells. MDCK cells were seeded on glass coverslips, infected with AV encoding PI5K or control AV, and then incubated in the presence of 0.25 ng/ml DOX to suppress PI5K expression. The following day, the DOX was washed out and cells were microinjected with cDNA encoding GFP-actin. Random fields were imaged 5 h later for 4-min intervals using an Olympus IX81 equipped with a ×100 Olympus UPlanApo objective. Actin comets were defined as rapidly moving bursts of actin followed by a fading tail of presumably depolymerizing actin. Comets generated in MDCK cells were distinct but generally smaller than comets described by others using different cell lines, which have been reported to be up to 5 μm in length (18Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr.

Comets were observed in 7% of control cells and in 27% of the cells overexpressing PI5K (Table 1, Fig. 2B, and supplementary movie).FIGURE 2PI5K localizes to actin filaments and stimulates actin comet formation in MDCK cells. A, MDCK cells seeded on coverslips were infected with AV-PI5K and processed for indirect immunofluorescence the following day to detect actin (with rhodamine phalloidin) and the PI5K HA epitope tag (visualized using Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody). Individual confocal sections and a merged image are shown. The enlarged insets highlight areas where colocalization of PI5K with short actin filaments is clearly evident. Scale bar, 7.5 μm. B, MDCK cells stably expressing GFP-actin were infected with AV-PI5K for 6 h and then imaged every 2 s. Enlarged areas shown are from individual frames from the supplementary movie. Two comets are seen to initiate from the area highlighted by the square over the time course; one at 108 s, and the other at 146 s. The starting points for each comet are marked with white arrowheads in subsequent frames.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Quantitation of actin comet frequency in MDCK cellsConditionNo. of cells imagedCells with comets%Control277.4WA100PI5K21226.9WA+PI5K440PMA3331.4PI5K + cyto D100PI5K + 1-butanol156.7PI5K + Ocrl470 Open table in a new tab Additionally, we were able to increase the frequency of actin comet formation in control cells by addition of the protein kinase C activator PMA, which has been previously demonstrated to stimulate actin comets in vivo (Table 1) (16Taunton J.

PMA also stimulated the rate of apical delivery of HA to an extent comparable with that observed upon overexpression of PI5K (Fig. 3). Conversely, addition of 1-butanol, which disrupts phospholipase D-mediated synthesis of the PI5K activator phosphatidic acid, profoundly inhibited the formation of PI5K-stimulated actin comets (Table 1) and also blocked delivery of TGN-staged HA to the apical surface (Fig. 3). 1-Butanol-mediated inhibition of phosphatidic acid synthesis has previously been implicated in the release of secretory vesicles from the TGN of endocrine cells (28Chen Y.-G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.-C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In contrast, t-butyl alcohol, which does not affect phosphatidic acid synthesis, had no effect on comet formation or HA delivery (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3PMA and 1-butanol have opposing effects on HA delivery. MDCK cells infected with AV-HA were radiolabeled for 15 min and chased for 2 h at 19°C. PMA (5 μg/ml PMA), 1-butanol (n-butanol; 1% v/v), or t-butyl alcohol (t-butanol; 1% v/v) were added as indicated 10 min prior to the end of the chase period and included upon subsequent incubation at 37 °C for the indicated times. HA delivery to the apical surface was measured by cell surface trypsinization. Similar results were obtained in at least three experiments for each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Effect of PI5K on HA Delivery Is Mediated through Arp2/3—If actin comets are involved in the TGN to apical membrane delivery of HA, then blockade of the N-WASP-Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization would be expected to inhibit HA transport. The WA domain of WASP/WAVE family proteins provides the binding sites for actin monomers and Arp2/3, and when expressed in isolation is a potent inhibitor of N-WASP function (18Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). As a control, we expressed the W domain, which binds to actin monomers but not to Arp2/3 (29Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar).Infection of MDCK cells with AVs encoding W or WA yielded comparable levels of the expected protein products (W ∼16 kDa; WA ∼18 kDa; Fig. 4A). As expected, expression of WA abolished PI5K-mediated formation of actin comets, demonstrating effective inhibition of Arp2/3 function (Table 1). We next examined the effect of the WA domain and PI5K on the morphology of polarized, filter-grown MDCK cells. Neither the WA domain nor PI5K had any apparent effect on cytoskeletal organization in polarized cells (Fig. 4B; similar results for W domain, not shown). Moreover, neither tight junction morphology nor the positioning and morphology of the Golgi complex was affected by expression of these constructs (Fig. 4, C and D), although we did notice in cells expressing very high levels of WA that the Golgi appeared to be somewhat dispersed toward the edges of the cells. Interestingly, whereas WA was diffusely expressed throughout the cytoplasm of polarized MDCK cells as expected, PI5K was concentrated near the apical membrane, a region that contains the supranuclear Golgi comp"

Both the Cl– channel ClC-5 and the Na+-H+ exchanger isoform 3 are critical components of the macromolecular endocytic complex that is required for albumin uptake, and therefore the cell-surface levels of these proteins may limit albumin endocytosis. This study was undertaken to investigate the potential roles of the epithelial PDZ scaffolds, Na+-H+ exchange regulatory factors, NHERF1 and NHERF2, in albumin uptake by opossum kidney (OK) cells. We found that ClC-5 co-immunoprecipitates with NHERF2 but not NHERF1 from OK cell lysate. Experiments using fusion proteins demonstrated that this was a direct interaction between an internal binding site in the C terminus of ClC-5 and the PDZ2 module of NHERF2. In OK cells, NHERF2 is restricted to the intravillar region while NHERF1 is located in the microvilli. Silencing NHERF2 reduced both cell-surface levels of ClC-5 and albumin uptake. Conversely, silencing NHERF1 increased cell-surface levels of ClC-5 and albumin uptake, presumably by increasing the mobility of NHE3 in the membrane and its availability to the albumin uptake complex. Surface biotinylation experiments revealed that both NHERF1 and NHERF2 were associated with the plasma membrane and that NHERF2 was recruited to the membrane in the presence of albumin. The importance of the interaction between NHERF2 and the cytoskeleton was demonstrated by a significant reduction in albumin uptake in cells overexpressing an ezrin binding-deficient mutant of NHERF2.

The epithelial cells of the renal proximal tubule reabsorb large amounts of water, Na+, Cl–,HCO3−,PO4−, glucose, and amino acids from the glomerular filtrate (1Maack T. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, New York2000: 3005-3038Google Scholar). In addition to ions and small molecules, proteins such as albumin cross the glomerular barrier (2Gekle M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 573-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions the tubular concentration of albumin in humans is ∼4 mg/liter (3Norden A.G.W. Lapsley M. Lee P.J. Pusey C.D. Scheinman S.J. Tam F.W.K. Thakker R.V. Unwin R.J. Wrong O.

This equates to 720 mg of albumin entering the kidneys each day and yet <30 mg of albumin is excreted per day, with the rest is constitutively reabsorbed in the proximal tubule by receptor-mediated endocytosis (2Gekle M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 573-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This process involves the binding of albumin to the megalin/cubulin scavenger receptor, internalization of the complex, subsequent dissociation of the albumin from the receptor in the endosomes (2Gekle M.

The functional basis for the obligate role of NHE3 in albumin uptake is less clear and may involve initiating the acidification of the nascent endosome by the electroneutral exchange of endosomal Na+ for cytosolic H+ (9Gekle M.

Christensen E.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F549-F558Google Scholar). These data are complemented by the finding of elevated levels of urinary protein in NHE3 knock-out mice (12Gekle M. Volker K. Mildenberger S. Freudinger R. Shull G.E. Wiemann M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F469-F473Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The situation with ClC-5 is more precise, because defective ClC-5 in Dent's disease patients results in proteinuria (13Lloyd S.E. Pearce S.H. Fisher S.E. Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Scheinman S.J. Harding B. Bolino A. Devoto M. Goodyer P. Rigden S.P. Wrong O. Jentsch T.J. Craig I.W. Thakker R.V. Nature. 1996; 379: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) as does ClC-5 knock-out in mice (14Wang S.S. Devuyst O. Courtoy P.J. Wang X.T. Wang H. Wang Y. Thakker R.V. Guggino S.

Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The proteinuria was hypothesized to result from reduced albumin uptake due to the lack of an anion shunt and failure of the endosomes to acidify (15Piwon N. Gunther W. Schwake M. Bosl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), although new data showing that ClC-5 functions as a Cl–/H+ antiporter questions the role of ClC-5 as an anion shunt (16Picollo A. Pusch M. Nature. 2005; 436: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 17Scheel O. Zdebik A.A. Lourdel S. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2005; 436: 424-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Another possible role played by ClC-5 is in mediating the protein-protein interactions that are involved in the assembly of the endocytic complex (6Hryciw D.H. Ekberg J. Pollock C.A. Poronnik P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by data from the proximal tubules of ClC-5 knock-out mice and patients with Dent's disease where megalin is down-regulated and the v-H+-ATPase is mistrafficked to the basolateral domain (18Christensen E.I. Devuyst O. Dom G. Nielsen R. Van der Smissen P. Verroust P. Leruth M. Guggino W.B. Courtoy P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 1285-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is also clear that albumin uptake involves actin cytoskeleton acting as an anchoring point for the endocytic complex (20Yun C.C. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 21Hryciw D.H. Pollock C.A. Poronnik P. Am. J.

Poronnik P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: F1227-F1235Google Scholar, 23Gekle M. Mildenberger S. Freudinger R. Schwerdt G. Silbernagl S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F668-F677PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of albumin causes actin clusters to form at the apical membrane that colocalize with the sites of albumin uptake (21Hryciw D.H. Pollock C.A. Poronnik P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: F1227-F1235Google Scholar). We have also shown that an interaction between ClC-5 and the actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin is required for albumin uptake (22Hryciw D.H.

Thus, although significant progress has been made in identifying both ClC-5 and NHE3, as essential and therefore rate-limiting components in albumin uptake, we have little insight into the protein-protein interactions that direct the formation of the endocytic complex and anchor it to the cytoskeleton.One class of proteins that is critically involved in the assembly of macromolecular complexes are PDZ module-containing scaffolds (24Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Cunningham R. Weinman E.J. Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The first PDZ scaffold protein described for an epithelial transporter was the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF, NHERF1, or EBP50) that was found to mediate the regulation of NHE3 by cAMP in the proximal tubule (25Weinman E.J. Steplock D.A. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a second protein, NHERF2 (or E3KARP), was also identified as a binding partner for NHE3 (26Yun C.H. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). NHERF1 and NHERF2 contain tandem PDZ modules and a C-terminal ezrin binding domain that can anchor the complex to the underlying actin cytoskeleton (24Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Cunningham R. Weinman E.J. Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Typically, PDZ modules bind to PDZ binding motifs in the extreme C terminus of target proteins, but they can also bind to internal sequences and lipids (27Hernando N. Wagner C.A. Gisler S.M. Biber J. Murer H. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2004; 13: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as well as also forming homo- and heterodimers (28Lau A.G. Hall R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8572-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).NHERF1 and NHERF2 share only 44% homology with most sequence conservation in their PDZ modules (26Yun C.H. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Significantly, they display pronounced spatial heterogeneity in the proximal tubule with reports in both mouse and human (29Weinman E.J. Lakkis J. Akom M. Wali R. Drachenberg C. Coleman R.A.

Physiol. 2003; 285: C1494-C1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) showing that NHERF1 is strongly expressed in the microvilli, while NHERF2 is primarily localized at the base of the microvilli in the vesicle-rich domains (29Weinman E.J. Lakkis J. Akom M. Wali R. Drachenberg C. Coleman R.A. Wade J.B. Pathobiology. 2002; 70: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 30Wade J.B. Welling P.A. Donowitz M. Shenolikar S.

Physiol. 2003; 285: C1494-C1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). NHERF proteins clearly have the capacity to nucleate the formation of functional complexes at the plasma membrane (30Wade J.B. Welling P.A. Donowitz M. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C192-C198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Thelin W. Hodson C. Milgram S. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and restrict the mobility of plasma membrane proteins, such as NHE3 (33Alexander R.T. Furuya W. Szaszi K. Orlowski J. Grinstein S.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3353-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus the organized subcellular distribution of NHERF1/2 is speculated to play a role in the specific interactions that mediate the physiological regulation of transporter function (31Wade J.B. Liu J. Coleman R.A. Cunningham R. Steplock D.A. Lee-Kwon W. Pallone T.L. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C1494-C1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The current study was therefore undertaken to investigate the potential involvement of NHERF1/2 in albumin uptake and whether this involved interactions with ClC-5, a key component of the albumin endocytic complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Antibodies—Anti-NHERF1 (35Lamprecht G.

Anti-GST conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was provided by Amersham Biosciences, and anti-MBP conjugated to HRP was provided by New England Biolabs. Secondary antibody conjugated to rhodamine was obtained from Calbiochem. Secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP were from Pierce.Cell Culture—The opossum kidney (OK) cell line was obtained from Dr. Daniel Markovich (University of Queensland), and the cells were maintained in DMEM/Ham's F-12 (DMEM/F-12) media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For experimental protocols, OK cells were seeded at confluence and grown for 5 days. Two days prior to experimentation, cells were incubated in DMEM/F-12 with 5 mm glucose medium lacking serum. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2.Characterization of NHERF2 in OK Cells—RNA was extracted from OK cells and HEK-293 (control) cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (2 μg) was treated with DNase (Promega) and then reverse-transcribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen). NHERF2 was amplified using primers described previously (37Yun C.C. Chen Y. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7676-7683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For Western blot detection, Triton X-100-soluble fractions of OK cells (40 μg) were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. NHERF2 was then detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-NHERF2 antibody (1:10,000 dilution). The cellular distribution of NHERF2 was determined by confocal microscopy using the NHERF2 antibody (1:100) and a secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to rhodamine (Calbiochem, 1:40).GST Pull-down Assay—Generation of the GST fusion proteins containing NHERF1 and NHERF2, the individual PDZ domains NHERF2 PDZ1 (PDZ1), NHERF2 PDZ2 (PDZ2) and NHERF2 C terminus (C-term) and the C terminus of ClC-5 (GST-ClC-5) have been previously described (19Moulin P. Igarashi T. Van Der Smissen P. Cosyns J. Verroust P. Thakker R. Scheinman S.J. Courtoy P.J. Devuyst O.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3353-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins were produced as described previously using the GST purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions (22Hryciw D.H. Wang Y.H. Devuyst O. Pollock C.A. Poronnik P. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40169-40176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In brief, the bacteria were induced to produce GST fusion protein with IPTG (1 mm), cells lysed and the GST fusion protein purified using a glutathione Sepharose 4B column. For the pulldown assay, 50 μg of GST or GST fusion protein were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4°C. The beads were then washed, centrifuged, and incubated with ∼1 mg of lysate from OK cells at 4 °C for 18 h. The beads were washed repeatedly, and the samples were eluted into Laemmli gel sample buffer. Samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blotting was performed using the appropriate antibody, and the blots were detected using secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP and the Super-Signal West Pico Substrate (Pierce). In addition, 50 μg of GST fusion proteins was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-GST conjugated to HRP to demonstrate an equal amount of protein in the reaction. The protein was detected using the SuperSignal West Pico Substrate (Pierce).MBP Pull-down Assay—The C terminus of ClC-5 was subcloned into pMAL-c2x (New England Biolabs). A mutant that lacked the final five amino acids (D741X) was generated using site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (38Hryciw D.H. Rychkov G. Hughes B. Bretag A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4304-4307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both plasmids were used to transform BL-21 component cells. The fusion protein containing the C terminus of ClC-5 fused to MBP (MBP-ClC-5) and the D741X mutant (MBP-ΔPDZ) were induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), the cells were lysed, and the fusion protein was isolated using an amylose column. For the direct interaction assay, 5 μg of MBP-ClC-5, MBP-ΔPDZ, or MBP alone as a control was incubated with amylose beads for 3 h at 4°C. GST-NHERF2 (300 ng) was then added to the complex, and the mixture was incubated overnight. The complex was pelleted and washed four times with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. The samples were suspended in Laemmli gel sample buffer, separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blotting was performed using the anti-NHERF2 antibody, and the blots were detected using secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP and the SuperSignal West Pico Substrate (Pierce). As a further control, 50 μg of MBP fusion proteins was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-MBP conjugated to HRP to demonstrate an equal amount of protein in the reaction. The protein was detected using the SuperSignal West Pico Substrate (Pierce).Immunoprecipitation—Protein-A-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) were used for immunoprecipitation experiments using the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, OK cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). 50 μl of Protein-A-agarose was incubated with the lysate for 3 h at 4 °C. The pre-cleared lysate was then incubated with anti-NHERF1 or anti-NHERF2 antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Protein-A-agarose (50 μl) was added to the sample, and the mixture was incubated for 3 h at 4°C. The pelleted beads were then washed three times in 500 μl of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), and the samples were eluted into Laemmli gel sample buffer, separated on a 5% SDS-PAGE gel, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blotting was performed with anti-ClC-5 antibody as previously described (22Hryciw D.H. Wang Y.H. Devuyst O. Pollock C.A. Poronnik P. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40169-40176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As a further control, 50 μg of OK cell lysate was resolved on SDS-PAGE gel transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-ClC-5, anti-NHERF1, and anti-NHERF2 to demonstrate equal loading of the lysate in each reaction.Electrophysiological Recording of ClC-5 Currents in Xenopus oocytes—Capped RNA (cRNA) transcripts encoding the full-length ClC-5 and NHERF2 were synthesized using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). Xenopus laevis stage V–VI oocytes were treated with collagenase (Type I, Sigma) for defolliculation. The oocytes were then injected with cRNA for ClC-5 (5 ng/oocyte) in the absence and presence of the cRNA encoding NHERF2 (10 ng/oocyte) or water as a control. The oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm pyruvic acid, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.5) prior to recording. Three days after cRNA injection, membrane currents were recorded from oocytes using the two-electrode (virtual ground circuit) voltage clamp technique using microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl. All recordings were made at room temperature (20–23 °C) using ND96 solution. Using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier and pCLAMP 8 software (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA), data were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and leak-subtracted on-line using a -P/8 protocol and analyzed offline. Inward Cl– currents mediated by ClC-5 were generated by holding the cells at –70 mV and applying 100-ms step depolarizations to membrane potentials from –30 mV to +80 mV. Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired t test (95% confidence interval).Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed with 8% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and then processed for frozen sectioning according to published methods (39Liou W. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 106: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Thawed sections were labeled with antibodies to NHERF1 or NHERF2 followed by 10 nm Protein A-gold (University of Utrecht).Transfections and Plasmid DNA—OK cells were transiently transfected with either a wild-type-NHERF1, NHERF2, dominant negative-NHERF1 lacking the ezrin binding domain (NHERF-1ΔEZR), NHERF2 (NHERF-1ΔEZR), or control pCDNA3 plasmid. The ezrin binding domain links the NHERF proteins to the actin cytoskeleton (24Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Cunningham R. Weinman E.J. Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, cells were transfected with the silencing RNA construct pSHAG (40Paddison P. Caudy A. Bernstein E. Hannon G. Conklin D. Genes Dev. 2002; 15: 948-958Crossref Scopus (1306) Google Scholar) containing OK NHERF1-specific sequences (EBP114: 5′-CCAACGAGCCGGGCTCCACCAGGCCGGAT-3′ and EBP248: 5′-GTCGACCACCAGCAGGCGCACGGCGTTG-3′) and human NHERF2-specific sequences (pSHAG 274: 5′-ACGGCGTCAACGTGGAGGGCGAGACGCA-3′ and pSHAG 361: 5′-CCGAAGCCAGACTGGGCACACACCGGCAG-3′) or the control vector (pSHAG-FF that contains small interference RNA against firefly luciferase). All transfections were performed using Fugene (Roche Applied Science) or Effectene (Qiagen), following the manufacturers' protocol.Albumin Uptake—We used standard albumin uptake methods in OK cells, a cell line commonly used for the study of proximal tubule albumin uptake (22Hryciw D.H.

For transfected cells, control (mock transfected with vector) OK cells or cells transfected with the various constructs were grown in 48-well plates for 7 days (21Hryciw D.H. Pollock C.A. Poronnik P.

To determine albumin uptake, cells were exposed to 50 μg/ml albumin conjugated to Texas Red (Molecular Probes) under the different conditions for 120 min (22Hryciw D.H. Wang Y.H. Devuyst O.

As a control to determine the level of endocytosis dependent on the intact cytoskeleton, some cells were pre-treated with cytochalasin B (1.5 μm) for 60 min before exposure to TR-albumin. Nonspecific binding was determined in cells exposed to albumin for 1 min. At the end of the uptake period, cells were washed in HEPES buffer, pH 6 at 4 °C, and then lysed in MOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS with 0.1% Triton X-100). The TR-albumin fluorescence was determined using a Fusion spectrophotometer (Hewlett Packard, Black-burn, Victoria, Australia) at 580 nm excitation and 630 nm emission wavelengths. TR-albumin uptake was standardized to total cellular protein, and the amount of fluorescence per microgram of cellular protein was adjusted for background.Cell-surface Biotinylation—Cell-surface biotinylation was used to detect the levels of ClC-5 in the plasma membrane and the levels of NHERF1 and NHERF2 associated with the plasma membrane. OK cells were transiently transfected with pSHAG-FF, EBP114, EBP248, pSHA"
https://openalex.org/W2089206274,"Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) binds steroids in the blood but is also present in the extravascular compartments of some tissues. Mice expressing a human SHBG transgene in the liver have human SHBG in their blood. In these animals, human SHBG accumulates within the stromal matrix of the endometrium and epididymis. This is remarkable because these tissues do not express the transgene. Human SHBG administered intravenously to wild-type mice in the presence of estradiol is rapidly sequestered within the endometrial stroma, and this prompted us to search for SHBG interacting proteins. Yeast two-hybrid screens revealed that fibulin-1D and fibulin-2 interact with the amino-terminal laminin G domain of SHBG. These interactions were verified in GST-pull down assays in which human SHBG bound the carboxyl-terminal domains of fibulin-1D and fibulin-2 in a steroid-dependent manner, with estradiol being the most effective ligand, and were enhanced by reducing the N-glycosylation of human SHBG. Like human SHBG, fibulin-1 and fibulin-2 concentrate within the endometrial stroma. In addition, SHBG co-immunoprecipitates with these fibulins in a proestrus uterine extract. These matrix-associated proteins may therefore sequester plasma SHBG within uterine stroma where it can control sex-steroid access to target cells. Given the interplay between fibulins and numerous proteins within the basal lamina, interactions between SHBG and matrix proteins may exert novel biological effects.

Like human SHBG, fibulin-1 and fibulin-2 concentrate within the endometrial stroma. In addition, SHBG co-immunoprecipitates with these fibulins in a proestrus uterine extract. These matrix-associated proteins may therefore sequester plasma SHBG within uterine stroma where it can control sex-steroid access to target cells. Given the interplay between fibulins and numerous proteins within the basal lamina, interactions between SHBG and matrix proteins may exert novel biological effects. Biologically active androgens and estrogens are transported in the blood by proteins, including sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), 4The abbreviations used are: SHBG, sex hormone-binding globulin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR.4The abbreviations used are: SHBG, sex hormone-binding globulin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR. and SHBG concentrations are the main determinant of the plasma distribution of these sex steroids between the protein-bound and non-protein-bound fractions (1Siiteri P.K. Murai J.T. Hammond G.L. Nisker J.A. Raymoure W.J. Kuhn R.W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1982; 38: 457-510PubMed Google Scholar). This is important because only non-protein-bound or “free” steroids diffuse from blood vessels to their target cells, according the “free hormone hypothesis” (2Mendel C.M. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 232-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). However, this process is influenced by physiological and anatomical variables, including blood flow and transit time in a given tissue, the extent of tissue vascularization and vascular permeability, the lipid composition of cell types in various compartments within tissues, and the extracellular matrix composition (2Mendel C.M. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 232-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). These are important considerations because in some organs the free steroid must traverse several cell types within the stroma, such as lipid-rich adipose cells, as well as the complex macromolecular structure of the basal lamina, before gaining access to target epithelial cells. Occupancy of the SHBG steroid-binding site varies depending on physiological state and circulating steroid levels, with almost all sites being unoccupied in children prior to puberty, and substantially greater occupancy of the sites in men than in women (3Hammond G.L. Obstet. Gynecol. Clin. North Am. 2002; 29: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). High resolution crystal structure analyses have shown that each subunit of the human SHBG homodimer contains a high affinity binding site for both testosterone and estradiol within its amino-terminal laminin G-like (LG-4) domain (4Westphal U.

Moreover, occupancy of the steroid-binding site by different types of steroids influences the conformation of the LG-4 domain (6Avvakumov G.V. Grishkovskaya I. Muller Y.A. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34453-34457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), especially in relation to a flexible loop structure that covers the steroid-binding pocket (8Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this region of the LG-4 domain of SHBG represents either a ligand-binding site or a macromolecular interaction domain in several structurally related proteins, such as neurexin, serum amyloid P component, and laminin-2α (9Rudenko G. Hohenester E. Muller Y.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 363-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Steroid ligand-dependent interactions between plasma SHBG and cell membranes have been reported (10Avvakumov G.V. Zhuk N.I. Strel'chyonok O.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 881: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Hryb D.J. Khan M.S. Romas N.A. Rosner W. J. Biol.

The current consensus is that unliganded SHBG interacts with a receptor located within the plasma membranes of some steroid-sensitive cell types, including breast (13Fortunati N. Fissore F. Fazzari A. Berta L. Benedusi-Pagliano E. Frairia R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and prostate cells (14Hryb D.J. Khan M.S. Romas N.A. Rosner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5378-5383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that occupancy of the SHBG steroid-binding site propagates an intracellular signaling event (15Rosner W. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). However, there is also evidence that SHBG interacts with human endometrial plasma membranes in a steroid ligand-specific manner (10Avvakumov G.V. Zhuk N.I. Strel'chyonok O.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 881: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although the identity of plasma membrane “receptors” for SHBG remains obscure, ligands (e.g. protein S and gas-6) for members of the tyro-family of orphan tyrosine kinases receptors comprise a carboxyl-terminal region, which resembles the tandem LG-4/LG-5 domain structure of SHBG and functions as their receptor-binding site (16Mark M.R. Chen J. Hammonds G. Sadick M. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9785-9789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that mouse megalin binds and internalizes SHBG-steroid complexes via an endocytotic mechanism (17Hammes A. Andreassen T.K. Spoelgen R. Raila J. Hubner N. Schulz H. Metzger J. Schweigert F.J. Luppa P.B. Nykjaer A. Willnow T.E. Cell. 2005; 122: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), as observed earlier in human breast cancer cells (18Porto C.S. Gunsalus G.L. Bardin C.W. Phillips D.M. Musto N.A. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and epithelial cells of the rat epididymis (19Pelliniemi L.J. Dym M. Gunsalus G.L. Musto N.A. Bardin C.W. Fawcett D.W. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). During our studies of mice that express human SHBG transgenes (20Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we have noted that human SHBG accumulates in the stroma of several sex steroid-sensitive tissues in which the transgenes are not expressed, such as the endometrium and epididymis, and that the sequestration of human SHBG from the blood by the endometrial stroma of mice is enhanced specifically by estrogen. These observations support an active mechanism to enhance sex steroid availability to specific target tissue compartments. To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying this extravascular sequestration of plasma SHBG, we set out to identify proteins that interact with human SHBG in yeast two-hybrid screens of a human prostate cDNA library, by using the LG-4 domain of SHBG as “bait,” and we then screened candidate proteins for their ability to interact with human SHBG in vitro. These experiments revealed that the matrix-associated proteins, fibulin-1D and fibulin-2, interact specifically with SHBG in a sex steroid-dependent manner, and co-localization of these proteins in the endometrial stroma suggests that fibulin family members contribute to the ligand-dependent sequestration of human SHBG within the extravascular compartments of some sex steroid-sensitive tissues in vivo. Animals—Mice expressing human SHBG transgenes and their wild-type (C57BL/6 x DBA2) littermates have been characterized previously (20Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For some studies, female mice were ovariectomized using a standard operating procedure. Mice were maintained under standard conditions with food and water provided ad libitum, and the experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Use Subcommittee of the University Council on Animal Care at the University of Western Ontario. Immunohistochemistry—After transcardial perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline, tissues of transgenic or wild-type mice were fixed in situ by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by immersion in the same fixative overnight at 4 °C. Fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin wax for routine histology and immunohistochemistry, as described previously (20Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry included rabbit anti-human SHBG antibodies purified by immunoaffinity chromatography (21Avvakumov G.V. Muller Y.A. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25920-25925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-human fibulin-1, which also recognizes mouse fibulin-1 isoforms (sc-20818, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and fibulin-2 antisera (generously provided by R. Timpl). Immunoreactive proteins were located using the EnVision™ + System, HRP (DAB or AEC) detection system (DakoCytomation California Inc., Carpinteria, CA). In Vivo Experiments—Wild-type BALB/c female mice were treated by gavage with 2.5 μg of estradiol/g of body weight in 100 μl of sesame oil daily for 3 days. This pretreatment was done to circumvent cycle-dependent changes in uterine morphology and to ensure that the uteri were at the same condition of estrogen stimulation. On day 4, mice received either 100 μl of sesame oil vehicle alone, or 2.5 μg of estradiol or testosterone/g of body weight in the same volume of sesame oil by gavage. Two hours later, anesthetized mice were injected via the tail vein with either 100 μl of physiological saline containing 130 μg of unliganded human SHBG, or the same amount of human SHBG in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of either estradiol or testosterone. Two hours postinjection, blood samples were taken for a saturation steroid-ligand binding capacity assay of SHBG concentrations (22Hammond G.L. Lähteenmäki P.L.A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 132: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and the mice were sacrificed for immunohistochemistry, as described above. Yeast Two-hybrid Experiments—Coding sequences from the aminoterminal (LG-4) domains of human (residues 1–205) and rabbit (residues 1–199) SHBG (23Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Smith C.L. Goping I.S.

Endocrinol. 1997; 153: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR using specific oligonucleotide primer pairs for insertion into the pAS1 vector at BamHI and SalI sites in-frame with the DNA-binding domain of GAL4. These GAL4-fusions were used as baits in independent screening assays of a human prostate cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain in pACT2 (Matchmaker cDNA library HL4037AH, BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190 was co-transformed with the pAS1 bait constructs and the prostate cDNA library. Selection for the HIS3 reporter gene was performed on plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and containing 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. After 1 week, colonies were restreaked and tested for β-galactosidase activity by using a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) colony-lift filter assay (as recommended in the Matchmaker manual). Plasmids from positive colonies were extracted and amplified in Escherichia coli JM109 to obtain the DNA sequences, which were then used to screen public databases with BLAST 2.0. In this initial screen, the following proteins were identified as interacting with both human and rabbit SHBG baits: filamin A, translation initiation factor F, metallothionein-II (MT-II), protein KIAA116, and fibulin-2. A separate screen using only the human SHBG bait confirmed potential interactions with filamin, MT-II, and fibulin-2 and added the carboxyl-terminal domain of fibulin-1D as a potential interacting partner. The specificity of interaction between human fibulin-1D and fibulin-2 and SHBG was evaluated using other baits. For this experiment, coding sequences for the LG-4 domains of human, mouse, and rabbit SHBG, the LG-5 domain of human SHBG (residues 205–373) and the amino-terminal LG domain of protein S were amplified by PCR and cloned into pAS1 for co-transformation into the yeast Y190 with either the human fibulin-1D or fibulin-2 pACT2 clones identified in the initial yeast two-hybrid screen. The interaction assay was monitored by both HIS3 selection and LacZ reporter gene activation, as described above. To map the region of human fibulin-2 that interacts with SHBG, deletion mutants of fibulin-2 were prepared by PCR. Amplified sequences were inserted between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pACT2 and co-transformed into the Y190 yeast strain together with a pAS1 vector containing coding sequence of the human SHBG LG-4 domain, and two-hybrid interactions were monitored by HIS3 selection. GST Pull-down Assays—The cDNAs encoding residues 495–677 of fibulin-1D and 1063–1157 of fibulin-2 were excised from the pACT2 clones obtained from the human prostate cDNA library by EcoRI and XhoI digestion. These cDNAs were then inserted into the same sites of a pGEX-KGK expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) for transformation into E. coli BL21 and the production and purification of GST fusion proteins, as recommended by Amersham Biosciences. Purified GST-fusion protein (25 μg) or the same amount of GST was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose, and incubated with diluted transgenic mouse serum containing ∼20 nm human SHBG in the presence or absence of 100 nm sex steroid (estradiol or 5α-dihydrotestosterone) or with a culture medium from Chinese hamster ovary cells that contained a similar amount of recombinant human SHBG or human SHBG mutants lacking specific N-linked carbohydrate chains in the presence of 100 nm estradiol (25Bocchinfuso W.P. Warmels-Rodenhiser S. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Sepharose-bound complexes were sedimented by centrifugation, and the beads were washed three times with the same buffer (without bovine serum albumin). Proteins bound to the beads were extracted by boiling in SDS-loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred by electrophoresis onto a nitrocellulose membrane for immunochemical detection of human SHBG, as described previously (25Bocchinfuso W.P. Warmels-Rodenhiser S. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Soluble protein was obtained from uteri of human SHBG transgenic mice at diestrus or proestus. Tissues were first minced and then homogenized by sonication in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 nm estradiol) containing complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The protein concentration of extracts was measured and 400-μg aliquots were incubated with antibodies specific to the fibulin-1 or fibulin-2 (0.5 μg/reaction) at 4 °C overnight. Protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were then added, and the reactions were further rocked at 4 °C for 2 h to allow antibody-protein complexes to be captured by the agarose beads. Immunoprecipitated protein complexes were recovered by centrifugation, supernatants containing the unbound proteins were removed, and the beads were washed with ice-cold extraction buffer without protease inhibitor. After three washes, the agarose beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and the immunoprecipitated protein complexes were recovered and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis for the target proteins. RNA Analyses—Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR experiments were performed from 2.5 μg of total RNA extracts of tissues taken from adult male and female transgenic mice carrying an 11-kb human SHBG transgene. Human SHBG and mouse fibulin-1D and fibulin-2 cDNAs were first prepared by reverse-transcription and were then amplified in a PCR with primers specific for the corresponding nucleotide sequences (Table 1). Mouse ribosomal RNA S16 was also amplified from each sample as a control for RNA integrity and for the RT-PCR.TABLE 1Primers used in the RT-PCR analysisPrimer nameSequenceHuman SHBG forward5′-GGGAGTGATTTTTTATGGHuman SHBG reverse5′-TGGACATACTCAGCTTCAMouse fibulin-1D forward5′-TGCCGACGAGGTTACCAGMouse fibulin-1D reverse5′-GGCGCACGACACCCACAGMouse fibulin-2 forward5′-CGAAGGGCAATGAGGAGGGCTACTMouse fibulin-2 reverse5′-AAGGAATGGAATGTCAGCTGTAGCMouse S16 forward5′-TCCGCTGCAGTCCGTTCAAGTCTTMouse S16 reverse5′-GCCAAACTTCTTGGATTCGCAGCG Open table in a new tab Statistical Analysis—Data are reported as mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments for all measurements.

Human SHBG Accumulates within the Stroma of the Endometrium and Epididymis of Transgenic Mice—Immunohistochemical analyses of tissues from several lines of transgenic mice that express human SHBG transgenes (20Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) revealed pronounced accumulations of immunoreactive human SHBG in the stroma of the endometrium and epididymis (Fig. 1A). This observation was remarkable because northern blotting experiments had indicated that these tissues lack human SHBG transcripts (not shown). Under high power magnification, the human SHBG in the endometrial and epididymal stroma appears to be associated with matrix fibers (Fig. 1A, iii and v, respectively). In light of a report that megalin is concentrated on the luminal surface of mouse endometrial epithelial cells (17Hammes A. Andreassen T.K. Spoelgen R. Raila J. Hubner N. Schulz H. Metzger J. Schweigert F.J. Luppa P.B. Nykjaer A. Willnow T.E. Cell. 2005; 122: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), it is also of interest to note there was absolutely no human SHBG in this location. Sequestration of Human SHBG from Blood by the Mouse Endometrial Stroma Is Steroid-Ligand-dependent—Because human SHBG transcripts are undetectable in the uteri of our transgenic mice, we performed an experiment to determine whether the human SHBG within the endometrial stroma originates from the blood. To accomplish this, we administered human SHBG into the tail veins of estrogen-primed, wild-type female mice in the presence or absence of testosterone or estradiol. Two hours later the uteri were removed and prepared for immunohistological analyses. The serum concentrations of human SHBG in these animals at the time of sacrifice were ∼600 nm, which is similar to that in the blood of mice that express human SHBG transgenes (26Jänne M. Hogeveen K.N. Deol H.K. Hammond G.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and is about twice as high as in the blood of pregnant women (1Siiteri P.K. Murai J.T. Hammond G.L. Nisker J.A. Raymoure W.J. Kuhn R.W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1982; 38: 457-510PubMed Google Scholar) or women taking oral contraceptives (27Hammond G.L. Langley M.S. Robinson P.A. Nummi S. Lund L. Fertil. Steril. 1984; 42: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, human SHBG was undetectable in the uteri of vehicle-treated control mice. Although low levels of human SHBG are present in the uteri of animals injected with the purified protein in the absence steroid ligands or the presence of testosterone, pronounce accumulations of human SHBG were consistently observed in mice in which the protein was administered in the presence of estradiol (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the human SHBG accumulated primarily in the stromal matrix and was concentrated toward the basal lamina of the endometrial epithelium in the animals treated with SHBG in combination with estradiol (Fig. 1B). The Carboxyl-terminal Domains of Fibulin-1D and Fibulin-2 Interact with the Amino-terminal LG-4 Domain of SHBG in a Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—To minimize the false positives encountered in yeast two-hybrid assays, we screened the yeast expression library independently with two bait constructs that comprised the LG-4 domains of human or rabbit SHBG. Although several potential SHBG-interacting proteins were consistently identified in a series of yeast two-hybrid screens (see “Experimental Procedures”), our observation that human SHBG is sequestered within the stromal matrix of the endometrium and epididymis focused our attention on the matrix-associated proteins, fibulin-1D and fibulin-2, which were both identified as potential binders of the LG-4 domain of SHBG (Fig. 2). In both cases, only the carboxyl-terminal regions of fibulin-1D and fibulin-2 were present in the pACT2 clones identified from the human prostate cDNA “prey” library. To confirm the specificity of these interactions, we examined the ability of these fibulin-1D and fibulin-2 sequences to interact with the LG-4 domains of SHBG from several species, as well as several other LG domain structures (i.e. the corresponding LG-4 domain within human protein S and the carboxyl-terminal LG-5 domain of human SHBG) in yeast two-hybrid assays. The results show that these fibulin-1D and fibulin-2 sequences interact only with the LG-4 domains of human, mouse, and rabbit SHBGs (Fig. 3). The region of fibulin-2 identified as interacting with SHBG is much smaller than the fibulin-1D sequence and spans only 95 residues within the carboxyl-terminal fibulin-type module (Fig. 2). Moreover, when amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions of this fibulin-2 sequence were tested in a yeast two-hybrid assay, we identified a minimal interaction domain spanning residues 1081–1157 within the fibulin-2 sequence (Fig. 4). Interactions between the Carboxyl-terminal Domains of Fibulin-1D and Fibulin-2 and Human SHBG Are Steroid-Ligand-dependent—A GST pull-down assay was used to verify the interaction between the carboxyl-terminal domains of fibulin-1D or fibulin-2 and human SHBG and to determine the effects of steroid ligands on these interactions. Instead of using pure SHBG for these studies, we used diluted transgenic mouse serum containing ∼20 nm human SHBG as a means of testing the specificity of the interactions in a semiphysiological context, i.e. in the presence of other plasma proteins. The results show the carboxyl-terminal domains of these fibulin family members interact selectively with human SHBG (Fig. 5A) and that this is more efficient in the presence of steroid-ligand, with estradiol promoting a stronger interaction than the androgen 5α-dihydrotestosterone (Fig. 5B). Loss of N-linked Oligosaccharides from Human SHBG Enhances Its Ability to Interact with Fibulin-1D and Fibulin-2—Because plasma SHBG exists as mixture of isoforms characterized primarily by the differential utilization of specific N-linked glycosylation sites (25Bocchinfuso W.P. Warmels-Rodenhiser S. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of SHBG mutants lacking specific N-linked glycosylation sites to interact with the carboxyl-terminal regions of fibulin-1D or fibulin-2 fused to GST in pull-down assays. This experiment indicated that disruption of either one of the two consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation within human SHBG promoted its ability to interact with fibulin-1D and fibulin-2 sequences in the presence of estradiol, and disruption of both sites further enhanced these interactions (p < 0.005) as compared with normally glycosylated human SHBG (Fig. 6). Uterus and Epididymis of Human SHBG Transgenic Mice Lack Human SHBG mRNA but Contain Fibulin-1D and Fibulin-2 mRNA—A semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis was used to verify the absence of human SHBG mRNA in the uterus and epididymis from mice expressing an 11-kb human SHBG transgene and to assess the expression profiles of endogenous fibulin-1D and fibulin-2 in the uterus and epididymis, as compared with other tissues. As expected from our previous studies (20Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), human SHBG mRNA is confined to the livers and kidneys of both male and female transgenic mice, with only very low levels in the testes (Fig. 7). In addition, the results confirm a lack of human SHBG transgene expression in the epididymis and uterus, and add credence to our assumption that the presence of immunoreactive human SHBG in these tissues is because of the sequestration of SHBG from the blood. By contrast, mouse fibulin-1D and fibulin-2 transcripts are present in all the male and female tissues studied but appear to be most abundant in the uterus and epididymis (Fig. 7). Human SHBG and Mouse Fibulin-1 and Fibulin-2 Co-localize within the Endometrial Stroma of Human SHBG Transgenic Mice, and Human SHBG Accumulates at This Site during Proestrus When Plasma Estradiol Levels Are Highest—To determine whether the biochemical interactions observed between SHBG and fibulin-1D and fibulin-2 might be relevant in vivo, we compared the tissue distribution of human SHBG and mouse fibulin-1 and fibulin-2 in serial histology sections of a human SHBG transgenic mouse uterus. This immunohistochemical study demonstrated that human SHBG (brown), mouse fibulin-1 (pink), and fibulin-2 (pink) are confined to the endometrial stroma of the uterus, with little if any immunoreactivity in the myometrial cell types or the luminal epithelium of the endometrium. Within the endometrial stroma, staining of all three proteins was frequently concentrated toward the luminal epithelium (Fig. 8, A–C), and immunoreactive human SHBG and mouse fibulin-1 appear to concentrate in the proximity of the basal lamina of the luminal epithelium under high power magnification (Fig. 8, D and E), whereas immunoreactive mouse fibulin-2 was distributed more uniformly throughout the endometrial stroma (Fig. 8F). To explore whether the accumulation of human SHBG"
https://openalex.org/W2025421894,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is a serine/threonine kinase with a broad array of cellular targets, such as cytoskeletal proteins and transcription factors. Recent studies with GSK-3β-null mice showed impaired NFκB-mediated survival responses. Because NFκB serves a dual role as a key regulator of cytokine-induced inflammatory gene expression and apoptosis, we investigated whether modulation of GSK-3β expression affects cytokine-induced and NFκB-mediated inflammatory gene expression. We observed that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) treatment of primary cultures of human microvascular cells reduced net endogenous active GSK-3β protein levels while inducing inflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)) expression. Interestingly, inhibition of GSK-3β by antisense oligonucleotides or pharmacological agent (10 mm lithium) potentiated TNF-induced expression of IL-6 and MCP-1 by 2–6-fold suggesting that inhibition of GSK-3β under inflammatory conditions (exposure to TNF-α and IL-1β) may contribute to enhanced cytokine expression. Overexpression of GSK-3β in endothelial cells, in contrast, significantly inhibited (by 70%, p < 0.01) both TNF-α and IL-1β-induced expression of IL-6, MCP-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Using adenoviruses in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mice, overexpression of GSK-3β significantly decreased TNF-α expression in lung and heart tissues (38 and 15%, respectively), further confirming the anti-inflammatory role of GSK-3β. Overexpression of GSK-3β did not affect the TNF-α-induced nuclear translocation of NFκB but reduced the nuclear half-life of TNF-α-induced NFκB considerably (by as much as 9 h) and enhanced phosphorylation (by as much as 33%). Interestingly, neither endothelial cell survival nor NFκB-mediated expression of anti-apoptotic genes was affected by GSK-3β overexpression. We conclude that GSK-3β selectively regulates NFκB-mediated inflammatory gene expression by controlling the flow of NFκB activity between transcription of inflammatory and survival genes. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is a serine/threonine kinase with a broad array of cellular targets, such as cytoskeletal proteins and transcription factors. Recent studies with GSK-3β-null mice showed impaired NFκB-mediated survival responses. Because NFκB serves a dual role as a key regulator of cytokine-induced inflammatory gene expression and apoptosis, we investigated whether modulation of GSK-3β expression affects cytokine-induced and NFκB-mediated inflammatory gene expression. We observed that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) treatment of primary cultures of human microvascular cells reduced net endogenous active GSK-3β protein levels while inducing inflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)) expression. Interestingly, inhibition of GSK-3β by antisense oligonucleotides or pharmacological agent (10 mm lithium) potentiated TNF-induced expression of IL-6 and MCP-1 by 2–6-fold suggesting that inhibition of GSK-3β under inflammatory conditions (exposure to TNF-α and IL-1β) may contribute to enhanced cytokine expression. Overexpression of GSK-3β in endothelial cells, in contrast, significantly inhibited (by 70%, p < 0.01) both TNF-α and IL-1β-induced expression of IL-6, MCP-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Using adenoviruses in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mice, overexpression of GSK-3β significantly decreased TNF-α expression in lung and heart tissues (38 and 15%, respectively), further confirming the anti-inflammatory role of GSK-3β. Overexpression of GSK-3β did not affect the TNF-α-induced nuclear translocation of NFκB but reduced the nuclear half-life of TNF-α-induced NFκB considerably (by as much as 9 h) and enhanced phosphorylation (by as much as 33%). Interestingly, neither endothelial cell survival nor NFκB-mediated expression of anti-apoptotic genes was affected by GSK-3β overexpression. We conclude that GSK-3β selectively regulates NFκB-mediated inflammatory gene expression by controlling the flow of NFκB activity between transcription of inflammatory and survival genes.

Two isomers, GSK-3α and -3β, sharing an 85% overall sequence homology have been isolated in mammals. The isomers have been implicated in multiple biological processes including cell proliferation, cell differentiation, embryonic development, cell motility, cell cycle, transcription, and metabolism. Unique to GSK-3β is its reported involvement in NFκB-mediated cell survival (8Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). GSK-3β is also responsible for the phosphorylation of a variety of proteins, including transcription factors (c-Jun, c-Myc, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein), translation eukaryotic initiation factor 2, and cytoskeletal proteins. GSK-3β activity is down-regulated by phosphorylation.In vivo, the function of GSK-3β is not clear. Data from knock-out mice studies show GSK-3β to be necessary for cell survival and NFκB activity (8Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Knock-out mice deficient in components involved in the NFκB signaling pathway, such as p65 and IκB kinase-β (9Beg A.A. Sha W.C.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3409) Google Scholar), are observed to share a similar phenotype to the GSK-3β knock-out mice, including massive liver degeneration and TNF-α-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis. These results point to an unexpected role of GSK-3β in the suppression of TNF-α-mediated apoptosis.NFκB is known to regulate both inflammatory genes (e.g. genes encoding IL-6, MCP-1, and VCAM-1) as well as genes related to cell survival (e.g. genes encoding BclxL, IAP1, and TRAF2). Previous studies have shown data that GSK-3β affects NFκB activity in hepatocytes and fibroblasts (8Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 13Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not clear if GSK-3β differentially regulates NFκB-dependent inflammatory and survival genes (12Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3409) Google Scholar, 14Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3261-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Here we show that in endothelial cells, GSK-3β selectively regulates NFκB activity and inflammatory gene expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Biological Reagents—Stock preparations of primary lung cell cultures from human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) were maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clonetics), and passages no higher than 10 were used in experiments. Cells were stimulated overnight in basal microvascular medium supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Biological reagents that were used to stimulate tissue culture cells included TNF-α and IL-1β (R&D Systems) and lithium chloride and dexamethasone (Sigma).Western Blot Analysis and ELISAs—Extracts for Western blots were prepared using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents kit (Pierce). Protein concentrations were determined with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–12% acrylamide) and then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with the appropriate primary antibody. The following antibodies were used: polyclonal rabbit antibodies against phospho-GSK-3β (Ser-9), phospho-NFκB p65 (Ser-536) (either Cell Signaling Technology or Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and NFκB p65 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Monoclonal antibodies against GSK-3β and BclxL were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories and Oncogene Science, respectively. Protein detection was carried out with the appropriate species-specific horseradish peroxides conjugated secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). To demonstrate equivalent protein loading, membranes were probed with anti-actin antibodies and with the appropriate secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) as described above. Densitometry analysis was carried out on all Western-blotted membranes using TotalLab software (Nonlinear Dynamics). For total tissue TNF-α concentration, protein was extracted with T-PER tissue protein extraction reagent (Pierce) at a ratio of 20 μl/mg of tissue, and TNF-α was measured by ELISA. ELISAs were performed on tissue culture supernatants (for IL-6 or MCP-1), methanol-fixed tissue culture cells (for VCAM-1, ICAM-1), and total tissue extracts (for TNF-α). ELISA reagents including cytokine specific antibodies for IL-6, MCP-1, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and TNF-α were obtained from RD Systems, and all protocols were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cytokine expression data were collected at 450 nm on a Labsystems Multiskan Ascent spectrophotometer.Antisense Oligonucleotide Treatment—In the GSK-3β knock-down assay, HMVEC cells were cultured in a 12-well tissue culture plate (0.5 × 105 cells/well; culture volume, 1 ml) and allowed to reach 60–80% confluency. The antisense phosphothioate oligonucleotides (gaggTGGTTCTGGGCCGCCCTacat) or sense phosphothioate control (atgtCAGGGCGCCCAGAACCAcctc) was mixed with Cytofectin™ transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Gene Therapy) and added dropwise onto the monolayers. After 3 h of transfection, the mixture was replaced with fresh basal treatment medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and TNF-α (10 ng/ml). After overnight treatment, the supernatants were saved for ELISA analysis, and the cells were lysed using 100 μl/well lysing solution containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 20% glycerol. The cellular lysates were assayed to determine protein concentrations using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Equivalent amounts of each sample were subjected to Western blotting as described above to evaluate the effects of silencing the GSK-3β gene in stimulated microvascular cells.NFκB Gene Arrays—Commercially available human NFκB and apoptosis arrays were obtained from SuperArray (Human PathwayFinder GEArray Q series, version 1 and Human Apoptosis GEArray Q series, version 1, respectively). Each array had 96 marker genes associated with the NFκB signal transduction pathway or apoptosis, which also included five housekeeping genes on each array. The arrays were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HMVEC were infected with Ad295ΔE1 or AdGSK-3β virus for 3 h at a multiplicity of infection of 250. Viruses were removed, and cells were allowed to recover in HMVEC growth medium (Clonetics) for 36 h. Cells were then washed and subjected to a treatment medium (basal growth medium plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin and TNF-α (10 ng/ml)) for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated by using Ambion's RNaqueous kit, and the concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. One microgram of RNA from each Ad295ΔE1 and AdGSK-3β-infected HMVEC was reversely transcribed into biotin-16-deoxy-UTP-labeled single-strand cDNA by using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. After prehybridization, membranes were hybridized with biotin-labeled cDNA and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin. Chemiluminescence was visualized by autoradiography. The five housekeeping genes on each array were used to confirm the integrity of RNA and the correct loading of different samples. Because the NFκB array included inflammation and only a few survival genes, we included the NFκB apoptosis array so that a representative number of survival genes would also be evaluated. By comparing the hybridization profiles in RNA samples from AdGSK-3β- and Ad295ΔE1-infected cells, we determined, for example, the expression profile for the Rel/NFκB/IκB family, which are the genes that are responsive to NFκB signaling (such as genes encoding ICAM-1–5, E-selectin, and VCAM-1) as well as other genes involved in the NFκB signal transduction pathway. The arrays were scored solely on the presence or absence of the gene expression. Array results were verified, in part, by Western blot and reverse transcription-PCR.Plasmid and Adenovirus Constructs—PCR was done with forward primer 5′-TCCTTTGGAATCTGCCATCGGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTCGGAAGACCTTAGTCCAAGGT-3′ to prescreen several cDNA libraries for GSK-3β gene amplification. Gel electrophoresis produced a 403-bp PCR amplicon that was highly expressed in a human skeletal muscle retroviral library (Clonetics). Five clones were positive for having GSK-3β cDNA. Sequence analysis showed that the clones contained GSK-3β cDNA (1263 bp) and some untranslated regions at the 5′ (145 bp) and 3′ (∼300 bp) ends. A 2-kb region containing the GSK-3β expression cassette was released from pLIB retroviral vector (Clontech), using SalI and XbaI and ligated in the shuttle vector pCI-neo plasmid (Promega) for the construction of the pCI-GSK-3β encoding GSK-3β. An intermediate vector called pAdGSK-3β (7.5 kb) was then constructed. pAdGSK-3β was generated from a 3.5-kb BglII-FspI fragment from pCI-GSK-3β containing a cytomegalovirus-GSK-3β promoter and SV40 poly(A) signal. pAdGSK-3β was inserted into pZap2.2 (optical density of 260) that contained the E1 and E3 regions of the adenovirus 5 genome, between the BglII and EcoRV sites and then cloned into Escherichia coli top 10 (Invitrogen). Briefly, the expression cassette was inserted in place of the E1 region (the E1 deletion was 3151 bp long and corresponds to the region 354–3503 in the Ad5 genome). The two SfiI sites that are naturally present in wild type/Ad5 DNA were mutated, introducing silent mutations in the adenovirus PVII and DNA-binding protein coding sequences. A control plasmid, pAd295Δ, was constructed similarly, except that GSK-3β gene was omitted. Adenoviruses AdGSK-3β and Ad295ΔE1 (experimental and control, respectively) were both constructed using the Adenoma™ cloning system (AdenoZap). Virus amplification and titration were done in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, which were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.Animal Experiments—One-month-old C57BL6 mice were infected intravenously with adenovirus AdGSK-3β or Ad295ΔE1 at 109 plaque-forming units of virus per mouse. Three days later, the mice were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (50 μg/kg) and sacrificed 3 h later. Pre- and post-LPS plasma were collected and tested for TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 expression by ELISA. Tissues including liver, lung, and heart were isolated and snap-frozen. Cellular lysates were prepared using T-PER tissue protein extraction reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by Western blotting.RESULTSGSK-3β Is Down-regulated by Inflammatory Cytokines—To determine the levels of GSK-3β in the presence of inflammatory agents, we used TNF-α and IL-1β, which are proinflammatory agents and dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory agent. Fig. 1A confirms that TNF-α and IL-1β induce a robust inflammatory response evidenced by an increased production of IL-6. Dexamethasone, as expected, did not change the basal IL-6 levels. Fig. 1B shows the effects of these agents on GSK-3β and pGSK-3β proteins (Western blot data from three independent experiments). We observed a trend for GSK-3β expression to be down-regulated by proinflammatory stimuli and not anti-inflammatory agents regularly, including dexamethasone. Interestingly, phospho-GSK-3β (pGSK-3β; the inactive form of GSK-3β) is slightly elevated by the proinflammatory agents (Fig. 1B). The pGSK/GSK ratio was increased by TNF-α and IL-1β (1.75 and 1.88, respectively; p < 0.01) suggesting an increase in inactive GSK-3β (Fig. 1C). Dexamethasone treatment did not show this increase in pGSK/GSK ratio. These data certainly suggest that the factors normally associated with inflammation (high levels of cytokines) may reduce GSK-3β expression and function.GSK-3β Inhibition Stimulates a Robust Inflammatory Response—To further explore the role of GSK-3β in inflammatory response in endothelial cells, we designed an antisense oligonucleotide to specifically block GSK-3β gene expression (see “Experimental Procedures”). We found that inhibition of GSK-3β using antisense oligonucleotides led to a significant (p < 0.001) increase in inflammatory activity of TNF-α as determined by the levels of TNF-α-induced IL-6 levels (Fig. 2A). The GSK-3β antisense-transfected cells showed greater than a 3-fold increase in IL-6 levels over the “sense” negative controls (average of three independent experiments). Analysis of GSK-3β and pGSK-3β revealed a 75% reduction in active GSK in antisense-treated cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 2B). To further understand the role of active GSK-3β in inflammation, we used lithium, a pharmacological inhibitor of GSK-3β enzyme activity (14Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3261-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 15Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20005-20010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of HMVEC with lithium significantly enhanced (by 8-fold) TNF-α-induced IL-6 expression (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that the inhibition of GSK-3β can contribute to a robust inflammatory response in endothelial cells.FIGURE 2Inflammatory response exacerbated by inhibition of GSK-3β activity. HMVEC were transfected with sense or antisense GSK-3β oligonucleotides and then stimulated with TNF-α (1 ng/ml) for 24 h. IL-6 levels in culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. Cellular lysates were analyzed for GSK-3β and pGSK-3β by Western blotting. β-Actin was used to normalize expression of GSK-3β and pGSK-3β. The histograms represent the average volume times the intensity of the bands (taken from three independent Western blot experiments). A, GSK-3β antisense-transfected cells showed a greater than 3-fold increase in IL-6 levels over the “sense” negative controls (average of three independent experiments; p < 0.01). B, analysis of GSK-3β and pGSK-3β revealed a 75% reduction in active GSK in antisense-treated cells compared with control cells. C, effects of lithium (a pharmacological inhibitor of GSK-3β; 10 μm) on TNF-α-induced expression of IL-6. Pretreatment of HMVEC with lithium significantly enhanced TNF-α-induced IL-6 expression (8-fold).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Overexpression of GSK-3β Suppresses the Inflammatory Response—We then investigated whether overexpression of GSK-3β blocks inflammatory gene expression. We used AdGSK-3β adenovirus to determine the effects of GSK-3β overexpression on inflammation. HMVEC were infected with adenoviruses (AdGSK-3β or Ad295ΔE1) and then stimulated with either TNF-α or IL-1β. We found that infections with AdGSK-3β resulted in the robust expression of GSK-3β in cells (Fig. 3A). Regardless of the stimuli (TNF-α or IL-1β) used, both IL-6 and MCP-1 expressions were down-regulated significantly (54–90%, p < 0.05) in cells that were infected with AdGSK-3β (Fig. 3B). Similar results were found with VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 (data not shown). Therefore, these data suggest that overexpression of GSK-3β down-regulates inflammatory gene expression.FIGURE 3Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GSK-3β down-regulates cytokine expression. HMVEC were infected with recombinant adenoviruses encoding GSK-3β vector or empty vector as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were stimulated with TNF-α (5 ng/ml)) or IL-1β (1 ng/ml) for 24 h. IL-6 and MCP-1 concentrations in tissue culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. A, Western blot analysis shows an abundant expression of GSK-3β in GSK-3β vector-infected cells compared with control vector-infected cells. B, IL-6 and MCP-1 expressions are down-regulated significantly (54–90%; *, p < 0.02; **, p < 0.03; or ***, p < 0.005) in cells infected with AdGSK-3β compared with control vector-infected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Anti-inflammatory Effects of GSK-3β in Vivo—Next, the in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of GSK-3β were determined. We used mice infected with AdGSK-3β or control vectors and challenged them with LPS for 3 days postinfection. As expected, most of GSK-3β expressions were found in the liver. Plasma levels of TNF-α in these animals were unaffected (data not shown). The tissue expression of TNF-α, however, was significantly decreased in the lung and heart (38%, p < 0.05 and 15%, p = 0.059, respectively) (Fig. 4). Plasma IL-6 levels were also significantly decreased (p < 0.05), when GSK was overexpressed (Fig. 4C). Our in vivo and in vitro data suggest an anti-inflammatory role for GSK-3β.FIGURE 4Anti-inflammatory effects of GSK-3β in a mouse model of acute inflammation. Mice were injected with an adenovirus containing GSK-3β gene or empty vector at a multiplicity of infection of 109 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Seventy-two hours postinjection, mice were injected with LPS (10 μg/kg) and sacrificed 3 h later, and plasma and tissues were collected. Cytokine levels in plasma and tissue lysates were analyzed by ELISA. The tissue expression of TNF-α was significantly decreased in the lung and heart (38%, p < 0.05, and 15%, p = 0.059, respectively) (A and B). Plasma IL-6 levels were also significantly decreased (p < 0.05) when GSK-3β was overexpressed (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Overexpression of GSK-3β Does Not Affect Nuclear Translocation of NFκB or Survival Genes—NFκB is a key regulatory molecule in inflammation. NFκB is responsible for the transcription of over 150 known genes including inflammatory genes such as those coding for IL-6, MCP-1, and VCAM-1 (12Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3409) Google Scholar). The NFκB translocation to the nucleus is a critical event in the regulation of the NFκB-dependent genes. Therefore, we investigated whether overexpression of GSK-3β had an effect on NFκB function. Interestingly, Western blot analysis showed that overexpression of GSK-3β did not show a significant effect on nuclear NFκB levels (Fig. 5, A and C). Thus, nuclear translocation of NFκBwas not interrupted by excess GSK-3β. In addition, NFκB-dependent expression of BclxL (gene associated with cell survival) was not affected by GSK-3β overexpression (Fig. 5, B and C). We further evaluated the effect of GSK overexpression on different NFκB-dependent genes using the cDNA GE array containing 96 NFκB target genes (supplemental Table 1). Total RNA from control and GSK overexpressing cells was hybridized to membranes containing probes for different NFκB genes. The expression levels were normalized to housekeeping genes on each membrane. Only 17 of 96 genes were affected by GSK-3β overexpression. The majority of those affected was inflammatory-related and showed a decrease in gene expression. Apart from cytokines, proteins related to NFκB transcription and those involved in TNF-α and toll-like receptor signaling (myd88, TIL4, and TLR3) were affected. The expression of proteins involved in apoptosis (e.g. inhibitor of apoptosis, caspases, and the Bcl2 family of proteins) was not affected (supplemental Table 1). These data suggest that overexpression of GSK-3β preferentially inhibits NFκB-dependent inflammatory genes without affecting survival genes.FIGURE 5Overexpression of GSK-3β does not affect nuclear translocation of NFκB nor expression of survival genes. HMVEC were transfected with adenoviruses containing either GSK-3β vector or empty vector. Forty-eight hours later, cells were stimulated with TNF-α (1 ng/ml) for 8 h. Nuclear extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-p65 (NFκB subunit) antibodies to monitor NFκB translocation (A and C quantified data). Overexpression of GSK-3β did not show a significant effect on nuclear NFκB levels. In separate experiments, 48 h after infection, cells were stimulated with TNF-α (5 ng/ml) for 24 h, and BclxL levels were determined by (an NFκB-driven gene) Western blotting. Overexpression of GSK-3β did not show a significant effect on BclxL levels (B and D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Overexpression of GSK-3β Reduces the Half-life of Nuclear p65—Although we found that nuclear translocation of NFκB is not affected by excess GSK-3β (Fig. 5), we examined whether the residence time for NFκB is affected by GSK-3β overexpression. Nuclear p65 (NFκB subunit) levels at different time points (post-TNF-α treatment) were analyzed by Western blotting. At 16 h, although 65–70% of the initial p65 was still present in control cells, it was reduced to 30% in GSK-3β-treated cells (Fig. 6A). Because GSK-3β is known to phosphorylate members of the NFκB superfamily, we tested whether the decreased half-life of NFκB was because of increased phosphorylated p65. To accomplish this, we monitored phosphorylated p65 levels and expressed them as a ratio to total p65. After 4 h, the ratio of phospho-p65/p65 was increased 3-fold in GSK-3β-infected cells and remained high (2-fold) until 8 h (Fig. 6B). Thus, it is conceivable that by phosphorylating p65, GSK-3β reduces the residence time of p65 in the nucleus.FIGURE 6GSK-3β reduces the half-life of nuclear NFκB in TNF-α-induced HMVEC by affecting the phosphorylation of p65. HMVEC were transfected with adenoviruses containing either GSK-3β vector or empty vector. A, forty-eight hours later, cells were stimulated with TNF-α (1 ng/ml) for 8, 16, and 24 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared at each time point. Nuclear extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-p65 antibodies to monitor NFκB translocation (quantified data, average of triplicates, actin normalized, p < 0.05). Although overexpression of GSK-3β did not show a significant effect on nuclear NFκB levels at 8 h, at 16 h, while 65–70% of the initial p65 was still present in control cells, it was reduced to 30% in GSK-3β treated cells. B, in parallel experiments, p65 levels were determined at different time points following TNF-α treatment (phospho-p65/p65 ratio quantified). After 4 h, the ratio of phospho-p65/p65 was increased 3-fold in GSK-3β-infected cells and remained high (2-fold) until 8 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONOur studies identified a critical role for GSK-3β in the regulation of inflammatory gene expression induced by TNF-α and IL-1β.

https://openalex.org/W1628804289,"We compared near-infrared observations of the recently discovered outer rings of Uranus with Hubble Space Telescope results. We find that the inner ring, R/2003 U 2, is red, whereas the outer ring, R/2003 U 1, is very blue. Blue is an unusual color for rings; Saturn's enigmatic E ring is the only other known example. By analogy to the E ring, R/2003 U 1 is probably produced by impacts into the embedded moon Mab, which apparently orbits at a location where nongravitational perturbations favor the survival and spreading of submicron-sized dust. R/2003 U 2 more closely resembles Saturn's G ring, which is red, a typical color for dusty rings."
https://openalex.org/W2154651542,"Cystatins are important natural cysteine protease inhibitors targeting primarily papain-like cysteine proteases, including cathepsins and parasitic proteases like cruzipain, but also mammalian asparaginyl endopeptidase. Mammalian cystatin F, which is expressed almost exclusively in hematopoietic cells and accumulates in lysosome-like organelles, has been implicated in the regulation of antigen presentation and other immune processes. It is an unusual cystatin superfamily member with a redox-regulated activation mechanism and a restricted specificity profile. We describe the 2.1Å crystal structure of human cystatin F in its dimeric “off” state. The two monomers interact in a fashion not seen before for cystatins or cystatin-like proteins that is crucially dependent on an unusual intermolecular disulfide bridge, suggesting how reduction leads to monomer formation and activation. Strikingly, core sugars for one of the two N-linked glycosylation sites of cystatin F are well ordered, and their conformation and interactions with the protein indicate that this unique feature of cystatin F may modulate its inhibitory properties, in particular its reduced affinity toward asparaginyl endopeptidase compared with other cystatins. Cystatins are important natural cysteine protease inhibitors targeting primarily papain-like cysteine proteases, including cathepsins and parasitic proteases like cruzipain, but also mammalian asparaginyl endopeptidase. Mammalian cystatin F, which is expressed almost exclusively in hematopoietic cells and accumulates in lysosome-like organelles, has been implicated in the regulation of antigen presentation and other immune processes. It is an unusual cystatin superfamily member with a redox-regulated activation mechanism and a restricted specificity profile. We describe the 2.1Å crystal structure of human cystatin F in its dimeric “off” state. The two monomers interact in a fashion not seen before for cystatins or cystatin-like proteins that is crucially dependent on an unusual intermolecular disulfide bridge, suggesting how reduction leads to monomer formation and activation. Strikingly, core sugars for one of the two N-linked glycosylation sites of cystatin F are well ordered, and their conformation and interactions with the protein indicate that this unique feature of cystatin F may modulate its inhibitory properties, in particular its reduced affinity toward asparaginyl endopeptidase compared with other cystatins. The cystatin superfamily of proteins constitutes an important class of natural cysteine protease inhibitors present in a wide variety of organisms. Their primary targets are family C1 cysteine proteases, including plant enzymes like papain, microbial proteases, and mammalian cathepsins (1Turk B. Turk V. Turk D. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 141-150PubMed Google Scholar). Besides playing a major role in lysosomal protein degradation, cathepsins have been shown to have more specific functions in antigen presentation, apoptosis, and bone remodeling (2Honey K. Rudensky A.Y. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 472-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 3Turk B. Stoka V. Rozman-Pungercar J. Cirman T. Droga-Mazovec G. Oresic K. Turk V. Biol.

Correspondingly, aberrant cathepsin function has been implicated in disease processes like inflammation, tumor invasion, or neurodegeneration (5Lang A. Horler D. Baici A. J. Rheumatol. 2000; 27: 1970-1979PubMed Google Scholar, 6Adkison A.M. Raptis S.Z. Kelley D.G. Pham C.T.N. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 7Podgorski I.

S. A. 2002; 99: 7883-7888Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To prevent inappropriate activation, cathepsin function must be tightly regulated. An important component of this regulation is provided by cystatins, inhibitory proteins that act through the formation of tight reversible complexes with cathepsins.Mammalian cystatins are divided into three classes (9Turk V. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 10Abrahamson M. Alvarez-Fernandez M. Nathanson C.M. Biochem. Soc.

Type II cystatins are somewhat larger (∼120 residues) extracellular proteins that usually contain two conserved intramolecular disulfide bridges. Kininogens (type III cystatins), which are present in blood, consist of three type II-like domains. In addition to inhibiting papain-like enzymes, a subset of type II cystatins has also been shown to reversibly inhibit mammalian asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP), 3The abbreviations used are: AEP, asparaginyl endopeptidase; CEW, chicken egg white; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.3The abbreviations used are: AEP, asparaginyl endopeptidase; CEW, chicken egg white; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. a family C13 cysteine protease involved in antigen processing, using a binding site distinct from the family C1 interaction site (11Alvarez-Fernandez M.

The inhibitor shares <35% sequence identity with other type II cystatins and possesses a unique extension of ∼6 amino acids at its N terminus. Compared with other cystatins, the protein exhibits a distinct specificity profile, binding tightly to cathepsins F, K, L, and V, less tightly to cathepsins S and H, and not inhibiting cathepsins B, C, or X (20Ni J. Fernandez M.A. Danielsson L. Chillakuru R.A. Zhang J. Grubb A. Su J. Gentz R. Abrahamson M. J. Biol.

The expression of cystatin F is limited to hematopoietic cells, with the highest expression levels being observed in monocytes, dendritic cells, and certain types of T-cells (19Halfon S. Ford J.

Furthermore, it has been shown that cystatin F mRNA becomes up-regulated during dendritic cell maturation (23Hashimoto S.I. Suzuki T. Nagai S. Yamashita T. Toyoda N. Matsushima K. Blood. 2000; 96: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these suggest a specific role for cystatin F in immune response-related processes, even though the details of this role, and indeed its primary enzyme target, remain unknown.Two N-linked glycosylation sites make cystatin F one of only two known glycosylated human type II cystatins (20Ni J. Fernandez M.A. Danielsson L. Chillakuru R.A. Zhang J. Grubb A. Su J. Gentz R. Abrahamson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24797-24804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition to the two disulfide bridges common to all type II cystatins, mature cystatin F has two additional cysteine residues. Either one or both of these form a third, intermolecular disulfide that allows redox potential-dependent dimerization of cystatin F (19Halfon S. Ford J. Foster J. Dowling L. Lucian L. Sterling M.

Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that is inactive as a cathepsin inhibitor. The dimer can be activated by chemical reduction, which is accompanied by a shift from dimeric to monomeric species (22Langerholc T. Zavasnik-Bergant V. Turk B. Turk V. Abrahamson M. Kos J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Here we present the crystal structure of recombinant human cystatin F. The structure reveals a disulfide-dependent inhibitor dimer with an unusually positioned ordered glycan that appears to protect the intermolecular disulfide. The structure suggests a molecular mechanism for reduction-dependent activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Expression—Cell lines overproducing full-length, C-terminal His5-tagged human cystatin F were obtained by methotrexate selection of dihydrofolate reductase-negative Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with a vector based on pcDNA DHFR, employing a protocol similar to that previously described for human asparaginyl endopeptidase (25Li D.N.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38980-38990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).Protein Purification—Up to 10 liters of culture medium were adjusted to pH 7.5 and loaded onto a nickel-agarose column that was washed with 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Cystatin F was eluted with washing buffer containing 300 mm imidazole and then dialyzed exhaustively into 100 mm NaCl in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. After concentration using Vivaspin 20 concentrators (Vivascience) the protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-200 column (Amersham Biosciences), followed by cation exchange chromatography on a HiTrap SP XL column (Amersham Biosciences) using a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Crystallization and Data Collection—The protein was concentrated to 25 mg ml–1. Crystals were grown at 4 °C from drops of 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of reservoir solution over a 400-μl reservoir containing 9% polyethylene glycol 3350, 180 mm zinc acetate/acetic acid, pH 4.6. The space group is P41212 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 65.35 Å and c = 123.18 Å.Two data sets, at the peak and inflection point of the zinc K edge, respectively, were collected at BM14, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, from a single crystal maintained at 100 K with 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol as a cryoprotectant. The data were processed using the HKL suite (26Otwinowski Z. Minor V.

No electron density was visible for the N-terminal 5 residues, whereas the C-terminal pentahistidine tag could be built in defined electron density. It is noteworthy that the ordered His tag, together with two aspartic acid side chains from a symmetry mate, coordinates three of the five zinc atoms found in the asymmetric unit and thus likely played an essential role in the phasing of the structure.Carbohydrate topologies were generated with PRODRG (33Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M.F.

Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar); coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB; ID code 2CH9).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMonomer Structure and Cathepsin Specificity—Human cystatin F was cloned, overexpressed, and purified from Chinese hamster ovary cell culture supernatant as will be described in detail elsewhere. The x-ray crystal structure was solved by a Zn-MAD approach and refined to Rwork = 21.7% with one protein molecule in the asymmetric unit (Table 1). The structure shows a typical cystatin fold: five β-strands forming a twisted antiparallel β-sheet, which wraps around an α-helix (Fig. 1, A and B). Excluding the β3-β4 loop, the cystatin F structure is most similar to that of CEW cystatin (PDB accession number 1CEW, 84 equivalenced Cα atoms, r.m.s.d. 1.6 Å). The only significant difference between the two structures is the positioning of the L1 and L2 loops with respect to the rest of the molecule, which most likely results from differences in crystal contacts.Cystatin F has a unique cathepsin inhibition profile, with a clear preference for cathepsins F, K, L, and V (20Ni J. Fernandez M.A. Danielsson L. Chillakuru R.A. Zhang J. Grubb A. Su J. Gentz R. Abrahamson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24797-24804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 22Langerholc T. Zavasnik-Bergant V. Turk B. Turk V. Abrahamson M. Kos J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interactions of cystatins with family C1 cysteine proteases are mediated by three regions, an N-terminal segment and the two hairpin loops L1 and L2 (Fig. 1B). Comparison with cystatin-protease complex structures (17Stubbs M.T. Laber B. Bode W. Huber R. Jerala R. Lenarcic B. Turk V. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 18Jenko S. Dolenc I. Guncar G. Dobersek A. Podobnik M. Turk D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) suggests that for cystatin F the relevant residue stretches are 35–40 at the N terminus, 81–87 (L1), and 127–133 (L2 and part of the preceding strand; cf. Fig. 1A). Local superpositions show that, as for the overall structure, cystatin F is most similar to CEW cystatin, which gives an r.m.s.d. of ∼0.85 Å for 24 Cα atoms. Given this degree of similarity, the differences in target profile are likely due to the properties of the amino acid side chains in the binding regions. Notably, cystatin F contains several unique basic residues, namely Lys35 and Lys40 in the N-terminal region and Lys84 in the L1 loop. Correspondingly, an electrostatic surface potential calculation reveals a mostly positively charged cathepsin binding edge (Fig. 1C) in contrast to the hydrophobic binding site of CEW cystatin (not shown). Considering the surface potentials of various cathepsins, it becomes obvious why cystatin F would preferentially bind to cathepsin L with its highly negatively charged active site cleft rather than to cathepsin S, which has an almost electroneutral active site surface (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, this preference is inverted for cystatin D (36Balbin M. Hall A. Grubb A. Mason R.W. Lopez-Otin C. Abrahamson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23156-23162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which presents a partly negatively charged binding site (14Alvarez-Fernandez M. Liang Y.-H. Abrahamson M. Su X.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18221-18228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Cystatin F Is a Covalent Dimer—Cystatin F contains two conserved disulfide bridges connecting residues Cys124 from β4 to Cys144 from β5 and Cys99 to Cys110 from the β3-β4 loop, respectively (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, cysteines Cys26 and Cys63, unique to cystatin F, form an additional intermolecular disulfide bridge across a crystallographic 2-fold axis, generating a covalent dimer (Fig. 2A) distinctly different from the three-dimensional domain-swapped cystatin C dimers observed previously (16Janowski R. Abrahamson M. Grubb A. Jaskolski M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The dimer interface brings the convex faces of the two β-sheets together, burying 2 × 1780 Å2 or ∼20% of the combined monomer solvent-accessible surface area. It involves five pairs of direct hydrogen bonds and additional water-mediated interactions. It is a common feature of the known cystatin structures that the N terminus of the inhibitor is highly flexible both in the crystalline state and in solution, even when bound to a target enzyme. Strikingly, the longer cystatin F N terminus (Fig. 1A) results in the cystatin F structure extending by ∼12 ordered residues adopting a coil structure and a minimal “swapped” sixth β-strand, which contributes two hydrogen bonds to the dimer interface (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2The cystatin F dimer. The histidine tag residues (146–150) have been removed in all panels. A, schematic of the cystatin F dimer, showing the crystallographic 2-fold axis. B, the dimer interface. The solvent-accessible surface of one subunit is colored to indicate the “footprint” of the second subunit (shown as a semitransparent schematic). Coloring shows interactions involving residues 25–36 from either subunit (dark blue), other interactions involving residues 37–40 from at least one subunit (light blue), and the remaining interactions involving only core residues from both subunits (pale green). C, steric hindrance prevents the dimer from binding to C1 family proteases. Left, a cystatin F molecule (cyan) has been oriented correctly for binding to papain (gray). Residues 25–36 of cystatin F have been removed for clarity. Right, reconstitution of the complete cystatin F dimer shows that the second cystatin molecule (purple) occupies the same space as the papain L domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Experimental data show that dimeric cystatin F is inactive as a family C1 protease inhibitor (22Langerholc T. Zavasnik-Bergant V. Turk B. Turk V. Abrahamson M. Kos J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To understand why the dimer is inactive, a model for the interaction of cystatin F with papain was constructed by superposition of cystatin F dimer on the (monomeric) stefin moiety of the crystallographic stefin B-papain complex (PDB accession number 1STF). The resulting complex shows that, whereas the binding edges of the dimer are accessible to papain, there is a significant clash between the cystatin dimer and the protease; the second cystatin F molecule, as well as the N-terminal extension of the first one, overlaps with almost the entire L domain of the cysteine protease, making productive binding impossible (Fig. 2C).Although the extent of the interface and the observed intermolecular disulfides are compatible with cystatin F forming a stable dimer, other properties of the interface are more suggestive of a transient interaction (37Bahadur R.P. Chakrabarti P. Rodier F. Janin J. Proteins. 2003; 53: 708-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar): the interface is unusually hydrophilic, ∼50% of the direct protein-protein contacts involve polar groups on both sides. Furthermore, the interface is fragmented, lacking a distinct solvent-excluding core (Fig. 2B), with most of the interface being supplied by a single chain of amino acids, namely the cystatin F N-terminal extension. Residues 25–36 (i.e. the residues uniquely ordered in the present structure) alone contribute two-thirds of either the buried surface area or the interatomic contacts and all ten direct hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2B, dark blue regions). Including the residues up to Lys40, the N-terminal region participates in >90% of all intersubunit contacts; a significant part of these contacts involves Phe38, a residue unique to cystatin F (Fig. 1A).Outside the N terminus few direct dimer interactions (Fig. 2B, pale green regions) are observed. In fact, the dimer structure could be described as forming a solvent-filled bowl with the N-terminal extension forming the base and two (low) sides, while the two β-sheets form the other two sides (Fig. 2A looks into the bowl). Not only are there few interactions between the two cores, but according to a hydrogen bonding network analysis carried out with WHAT IF (38Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar) potential hydrogen bonding interactions remain unsatisfied, which is energetically unfavorable compared with the solvated monomeric state. The N-terminal extension up to residue Pro36 forms mostly polar but electroneutral contacts with the other chain, suggesting that it would be enthalpically indifferent to the dimer/(solvated) monomer transition, while the entropic gain on flexibilization of the polypeptide chain should favor the monomeric state. Taken together, this suggests that the cystatin F dimer, far from being thermodynamically stable, may be “spring loaded” and ready to fall apart as soon as the stabilizing intermolecular disulfide bridges become reduced. This is in agreement with the observation that cystatin F becomes active as an inhibitor only after reduction (22Langerholc T. Zavasnik-Bergant V. Turk B. Turk V. Abrahamson M. Kos J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).N-linked Glycosylation Modulates Function—As predicted, cystatin F is modified by N-linked glycosylation on Asn62 and Asn115. The latter site lies in a less ordered part of the cystatin F structure, and the glycan is only partly visible in the electron density. In contrast, the sugars bound to Asn62 at the C-terminal end of helix α1 are significantly better ordered: both N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues are clearly visible, and the electron density shows evidence for core fucosylation, i.e. an l-fucose residue α1–6 linked to the protein-proximal GlcNAc (Fig. 3A). Two of the sugars form hydrogen bonds with the protein; the side chain amide of Asn65 donates a hydrogen bond to O4 of the fucose, while the proximal GlcNAc accepts two hydrogen bonds, one from Nζ of Lys59 to the acetyl oxygen, the other from the backbone amide of Thr25′ of the second cystatin chain to O3 (Fig. 3A). This sugar thus contributes to the dimer interface.FIGURE 3N-linked glycosylation at Asn62.

Considering that they are anchored by hydrogen bonds, it is conceivable that this arrangement helps to prevent inappropriate reduction of the cystatin F dimer. This is in agreement with the observation that unusually high concentrations of reductant are required to activate the dimeric form in vitro (22Langerholc T. Zavasnik-Bergant V. Turk B. Turk V.

Although entry of the charged transfer messenger RNA (tmRNA) into the ribosome proceeded in the absence of elongation factor (EF-Tu) and in the presence of EF-Tu and the antibiotic kirromycin, evidence was found for the involvement of EF-Tu in trans-translation initiation. The polyalanine synthesis system attained by using a tmRNA variant consisting of only the tRNA-like domain revealed that it was completely dependent on the presence of SmpB and greatly enhanced by EF-Tu and EF-G. Actually, ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of EF-Tu was stimulated by the addition of SmpB and tmRNA but independently of template mRNA, demonstrating that SmpB compensates for the lack of codon-anticodon interaction during the first step of the trans-translation initiation. Based on these results, we suggest that SmpB structurally mimics the anticodon arm of tRNA and elicits GTP hydrolysis of EF-Tu upon tmRNA accommodation in the A site of the ribosome.

(also known as 10Sa RNA or SsrA RNA) to rescue stalled ribosomes that are translating incomplete mRNAs that lack termination codons (reviewed in Refs. 1Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar and 2Haebel P.W. Gutmann S. Ban N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the first step of the trans-translation process, tmRNA enters the A site of the stalled ribosome in an alanine-charged form and functions as tRNA without deciphering the codon, followed by the addition of an alanine residue to the nascent polypeptide. Subsequently, tmRNA serves as a substitute for mRNA using a short open reading frame (ORF) with a termination codon within tmRNA. By switching the message from that encoded in an incomplete mRNA to that encoded within tmRNA, protein synthesis is completed, and the protein is tagged with a specific C-terminal sequence that marks it for degradation (3Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The stalled ribosomes are released to participate in new translation reactions. The addition of the tmRNA-encoded tag peptide causes the degradation of newly synthesized incomplete protein that may be unnecessary or harmful to the cell, because of its inability to fold correctly. In this way, bacterial cells maintain the quality of translation and newly synthesized proteins. It is known that SmpB (Small protein B) binds to tmRNA to participate in trans-translation. SmpB interacts with the tRNA-like domain (TLD) of tmRNA (4Barends S. Karzai A.W. Sauer R.T. Wower J. Kraal B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 5Gutmann S.

Ueda T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A recent report that C-tail-truncated or -mutated SmpB facilitates tmRNA binding to the ribosome, but cannot attach an alanine residue to the nascent peptide, indicates that SmpB is also involved in the peptidyl transfer reaction at the A site of the ribosome in addition to conveying tmRNA onto the ribosome (12Sundermeier T.R.

It is known that EF-Tu binds to an aminoacyl moiety of alanyl-tmRNA (13Barends S. Wower J. Kraal B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2652-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Rudinger-Thirion J.

Biol. 2001; 314: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and EF-Tu is thought to be important for the initial entry of the alanyl-tmRNA into the A site of the ribosome, in a manner similar to the entry of common aminoacyl-tRNA. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that EF-Tu enhances tmRNA entry into the ribosome (8Hallier M. Ivanova N. Rametti A. Pavlov M. Ehrenberg M. Felden B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25978-25985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The binding of EF-Tu to the alanyl-tmRNA, as well as the binding of SmpB, on the ribosome has been shown with a cryoelectron microscopy density map (16Valle M. Gillet R. Kaur S. Henne A. Ramakrishnan V. Frank J. Science. 2003; 300: 127-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In contrast, the dispensability of EF-Tu for the initial step of trans-translation also has been described (8Hallier M. Ivanova N. Rametti A. Pavlov M. Ehrenberg M. Felden B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25978-25985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It has not been shown whether the hydrolysis of GTP occurs in the EF-Tu-dependent tmRNA entry into the ribosome. In our previous report (10Shimizu Y. Ueda T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we analyzed the role of SmpB in the trans-translation reaction by using a reconstituted in vitro system with purified components of the translation process (PURESYSTEM) (17Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Here, by using this system, we have carried out further investigations of trans-translation initiation, including the functional analysis of SmpB and EF-Tu. The involvement of EF-Tu in trans-translation initiation is evaluated by using purified stalled ribosomes and revealed that alanyl-tmRNA entry into the A site of the ribosome can proceed independently of EF-Tu. However, protection analysis reveals that EF-Tu, as well as SmpB, binds to the TLD of tmRNA with high affinity, although excess amounts of SmpB decrease this affinity by competing for the same binding site on the TLD. Surprisingly, template-independent polyalanine synthesis on the ribosome is observed using SmpB and a tmRNA variant that possesses only the TLD, and the rate of polyalanine synthesis is enhanced by the addition of EF-Tu or by the addition of EF-G but inhibited by the addition of kirromycin and template RNA. Furthermore, the complex consisting of SmpB and tmRNA or SmpB and TLD directly stimulates the ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of EF-Tu, suggesting SmpB conveys a signal equivalent to the codon-anticodon pairing. These results, combined with the previous structural studies, suggest that SmpB mimics an anticodon arm of the canonical tRNA and compensates for the lack of the codon-anticodon pairing in the trans-translation initiation. Preparation of Protein Factors—The components used in the PURESYSTEM were purified as described in a previous report (17Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). SmpB was purified as described previously (10Shimizu Y. Ueda T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); however, the digestion with thrombin and subsequent Mono-S purification steps were abbreviated. The plasmid encoding mutant SmpB that lacks the C-terminal seven amino acid residues was generated using a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). This mutant SmpB was purified in the same manner as wild-type SmpB. The concentration of the purified protein was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Preparation of RNA Samples—E. coli tRNAPhe was prepared as described (18Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Watanabe K. Ueda T. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli tmRNA, tRNAAla, and the tmRNA mutant, TLDwAL, were runoff-transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase. DNA templates for in vitro transcription were prepared as follows. DNA fragments encoding the respective RNA sequences were amplified from genomic DNA (tmRNA) or without template DNA (tRNAAla, TLDwAL) and cloned into pUC18. With the resulting plasmids as templates, DNA fragments containing a T7 promoter directly upstream of the RNAs were amplified by PCR using the appropriate primers. The in vitro transcription products were purified by 5 (tmRNA) or 12% (tRNAPhe, tRNAAla, and TLDwAL) denaturing PAGE. Aminoacylation—Reaction conditions and methods for the aminoacylation were as described previously (10Shimizu Y. Ueda T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 3H-Labeled alanyl-tmRNA, alanyl-TLDwAL, and alanyl-tRNAAla for protection analysis were prepared as follows. The reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, 95 mm potassium chloride, 5 mm ammonium chloride, 0.5 mm calcium chloride, 1 mm spermidine, 8 mm putrescine, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 740 kBq of [3H]alanine (Amersham Biosciences), 2 μm SmpB (for tmRNA and TLDwAL), 350 units of AlaRS, and 42 pmol of each RNA. After a 40-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 10% (v/v) 3 m potassium acetate, pH 5.2, followed by water-saturated phenol extraction. The aqueous layer containing aminoacylated RNA was precipitated by isopropyl alcohol, and the pellet was dissolved in 10 mm potassium acetate, pH 5.2. Aliquots containing 4700–8700 cpm (0.07–0.13 pmol) of alanylated RNA were stored at –80 °C. Translation Experiments—The template plasmid for the truncated DHFR was prepared as described previously (10Shimizu Y. Ueda T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The reaction conditions for the PURESYSTEM were as described previously (17Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar), with a slight modification. Synthesized proteins containing [14C]alanine were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized with a BAS-5000 bio-imaging analyzer (Fujifilm). Radioactive alanine incorporation into the synthesized protein on the ribosome was measured as follows. The reaction mixtures (50 μl), with poly(U) as a template (Fig. 6, A and B), contained 5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, 95 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm ammonium chloride, 0.5 mm calcium chloride, 1 mm spermidine, 8 mm putrescine, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm each ATP and GTP, 50 μm phenylalanine, 9.25 kBq of [14C]alanine, 12 pmol of ribosome, 1 μg of EF-G, 2 μg of EF-Tu, 1 μg of EF-Ts, 10 μgof AlaRS, 10 μg of PheRS, and 1.1 μm SmpB. The reaction mixtures (50 μl) without template (Fig. 6, C–E) contained 7 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, 95 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm ammonium chloride, 0.5 mm calcium chloride, 1 mm spermidine, 8 mm putrescine, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm each ATP and GTP, 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2.3 units/ml pyruvate kinase (Sigma), 40 μm cold alanine, 185 kBq of [3H]alanine, 12 pmol of ribosome, 1 μg of EF-G, 1 μg of EF-Ts, and 10 μg of AlaRS. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for the specified times. Aliquots (8 μl) were withdrawn, spotted on Whatman 3MM filter paper, and boiled in 10% trichloroacetic acid at 90 °C for 30 min to deacylate the aminoacyl-RNAs. The radioactivity in the 10% trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. For the Tricine-SDS-PAGE analysis, aliquots (5 μl) were withdrawn and mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer at specified times. Synthesized proteins containing [14C]alanine were separated by Tricine-SDS-PAGE (19Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) and visualized with a BAS-5000 bio-imaging analyzer (Fujifilm). Preparation of the Pre-trans-translation Complex—The pre-trans-translation complex was prepared as follows. A template for the truncated DHFR without a stop codon was translated in the PURESYSTEM (100 μl) containing 100 pmol of ribosome. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, reaction mixtures were loaded on 300 μl of a 20% sucrose buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 60 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 20% sucrose, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), followed by ultracentrifugation at 66,000 rpm for 3 h using a TLA 100.2 rotor (Beckman Coulter). The supernatant was discarded, and the pelleted pre-trans-translation complex was dissolved with 20 μl of ribosome buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 30 mm KCl, 6 mm Mg(OAc)2, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The sample was used immediately in the trans-translation experiment. Trans-translation Experiment Using the Pre-trans-translation Complex—The reaction mixtures (10 μl) used for the trans-translation experiment contained 9 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, 95 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm ammonium chloride, 0.5 mm calcium chloride, 1 mm spermidine, 8 mm putrescine, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm each ATP and GTP, 1.85 kBq of [14C]alanine, 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.1 unit of pyruvate kinase, 0.2 μg of SmpB, and 70 units of alanyl-tRNA synthetase. After a preincubation at 37 °C for 10 min to allow pyruvate kinase to put the EF-Tu in the GTP form, the reaction was started by the addition of 10 pmol of tmRNA and 2μl of pre-trans-translation complex (10 pmol of ribosome). After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were spotted on Whatman 3MM filter paper and boiled in 10% trichloroacetic acid at 90 °C for 30 min to deacylate the alanyl-tmRNA. The radioactivity in the 10% trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. Protection Analysis—Protection analysis was performed according to Hanada et al. (20Hanada T. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Takemoto-Hori C. Sprinzl M. Watanabe K. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 7 mm magnesium chloride, 60 mm ammonium chloride, 1 mm DTT, 200 μm GTP, 2.25 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2.3 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 60 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the specified concentrations of EF-Tu and SmpB. After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C for the conversion of EF-Tu/GDP to EF-Tu/GTP, the reaction mixtures were placed on ice. After the reaction mixtures were preincubated at 30 °C, 3H-alanylated RNA (0.07 nmol of alanyl-tmRNA, 0.08 nmol of alanyl-TLDwAL, or 0.13 nmol of alanyl-tRNAAla) was added. After 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min of incubation, 15 μl were withdrawn from each sample and spotted on Whatman 3MM filter paper. The radioactivity of the 5% trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fractions was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. The natural logarithmic ratios of the remaining 3H counts at the specified times over the one at 0 min were plotted, and the reciprocal slopes of the linear fits were calculated as the rate constants of alanylated RNA decay. GTPase Assay—Ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of EF-Tu was measured spectrophotometrically with a GTP-regenerating system as described (21Ueno T. Taguchi H. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 7 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, 95 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm ammonium chloride, 0.5 mm calcium chloride, 1 mm spermidine, 8 mm putrescine, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm each ATP and GTP, 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 2.3 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 4 μg l-lactate dehydrogenase (Roche Applied Science), 100 μm alanine, 1 μg of EF-Ts, and 10 μg of AlaRS. When indicated, 4 μm EF-Tu, 2 μm SmpB, and 50 pmol of TLDwAL, tmRNA, or tRNAAla were added to the reaction mixtures. After the reaction mixture was preincubated at 37 °C for 2–3 min, 50 pmol of ribosomes were added, and the mixtures were vigorously stirred to initiate the GTP hydrolysis reaction. The decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm, because of oxidation of NADH, was monitored continuously with a spectrophotometer (V-550, Jasco, Japan) at 37 °C. EF-Tu Is Dispensable for tmRNA Entry into the Ribosome—To observe the effect of EF-Tu on tmRNA entry into the ribosome, a pretrans-translation complex was prepared, corresponding to a ribosome stalled by a truncated mRNA. An E. coli dhfr gene that had been digested in the middle of the ORF was translated using the PURESYSTEM. The stalled ribosome-mRNA-polypeptide complex was carefully isolated through sucrose density ultracentrifugation to eliminate soluble factors, especially EF-Tu (Fig. 1A). By using this complex, the tagging reaction mediated by tmRNA and SmpB in the presence and absence of EF-Tu was monitored by the incorporation of the [14C]alanine into the nascent polypeptide, as determined by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1B, the complete tagging reaction proceeded in the presence of EF-Tu, whereas the omission of EF-Tu resulted in the synthesis of shorter polypeptide but labeled with [14C]alanine corresponding to the alanylated truncated DHFR. In the presence of EF-Tu, the addition of kirromycin, an antibiotic that specifically inhibits the conformational change of EF-Tu on the ribosome, thereby hindering the proper positioning of the aminoacyl-tRNA on the ribosome and the subsequent peptidyl transfer reaction (22Rodnina M.V. Fricke R. Kuhn L. Wintermeyer W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2613-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), also resulted in the synthesis of [14C]alanine-labeled truncated DHFR. The fact that the depletion of EF-Tu and the addition of kirromycin both failed to carry out the complete tagging reaction indicated that it progressed in an EF-Tu-dependent manner and that the pre-trans-translation complex preparation contained no EF-Tu. However, these results also demonstrated that [14C]alanine could be incorporated into the protein even in the absence of EF-Tu, indicating that alanyl-tmRNA was able to enter the A site of the ribosome without EF-Tu. In order to define the minimal components necessary for alanyl-tmRNA entry into the ribosome and peptidyl transfer to the alanyl-tmRNA, the incorporation of the alanine residue into the nascent polypeptide on the pre-trans-translation complex was examined in the absence of tmRNA, in the presence and absence of EF-Tu, and in the presence of EF-Tu and kirromycin (Fig. 2A). As expected, similar levels of alanine were incorporated into the nascent polypeptide in the presence or absence of EF-Tu and in the presence of EF-Tu and kirromycin. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the product corresponded to the alanylated truncated DHFR (data not shown). Fig. 2B shows that use of the GDP-form of EF-Tu in place of the GTP-form did not affect the incorporation of the alanine into the nascent polypeptide. These observations could not be attributed to nonspecific binding to the ribosome, because normal tRNAAla could not bring about the incorporation of alanine (data not shown). These data demonstrate that EF-Tu was dispensable for the alanylation of the polypeptide. EF-Tu Strongly Binds to Alanyl-tmRNA—The finding that the transtranslation initiation was independent of EF-Tu led to a reinvestigation of the interactions among alanyl-tmRNA, EF-Tu, and SmpB. Previous studies on the interaction of EF-Tu and alanyl-tmRNA were conducted in the absence of SmpB (13Barends S. Wower J. Kraal B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2652-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Rudinger-Thirion J. Giege R. Felden B. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1999; 5: 989-992Google Scholar, 15Stepanov V.G. Nyborg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although the interaction of EF-Tu and alanyl-tmRNA was demonstrated in the presence of SmpB (4Barends S. Karzai A.W. Sauer R.T. Wower J. Kraal B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the interrelationships among the three molecules were not elucidated clearly. The affinity of EF-Tu for alanyl-tmRNA has been reported as both Kd ∼5 μm (13Barends S. Wower J. Kraal B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2652-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and Kd ∼50 nm (15Stepanov V.G. Nyborg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, the affinity of EF-Tu for alanyl-tmRNA was examined in the absence and presence of SmpB. Because both SmpB and EF-Tu had been shown to protect against RNase A cleavage (4Barends S. Karzai A.W. Sauer R.T. Wower J. Kraal B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the protection of alanyl-tmRNA against nonenzymatic deacylation in a neutral buffer was examined. As shown in Fig. 3A, the addition of increasing concentrations of EF-Tu had a drastic effect on the protection of alanyl-tmRNA. Almost all the alanyl-tmRNA was protected in the presence of 0.8 μm EF-Tu. Half-maximal protection was observed in the range of 0.05–0.1 μm EF-Tu, in agreement with the results of Stepanov and Nyborg (15Stepanov V.G. Nyborg J. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2652-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the addition of increasing amounts of SmpB to reaction mixtures containing 0.8 μm EF-Tu, a concentration that conferred nearly complete protection of the aminoacyl moiety of alanyl-tmRNA, decreased the protection of the alanyl-tmRNA. Equimolar amounts of SmpB to the amounts of EF-Tu almost completely eliminated the protection (Fig. 3B). Because SmpB did not protect the aminoacyl moiety of alanyl-tmRNA in the previous study (4Barends S. Karzai A.W. Sauer R.T. Wower J. Kraal B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), these data indicated that the binding site of SmpB competed with its counterpart in EF-Tu. This result is also inconsistent with previous results indicating that SmpB had no effect on the protection by EF-Tu (4Barends S. Karzai A.W. Sauer R.T. Wower J. Kraal B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, those experiments used 40 μm EF-Tu in the reaction mixtures, a concentration at which competition by SmpB probably was not detectable. Positive and Negative Cooperativity of SmpB and EF-Tu toward the Alanylated TLD of tmRNA—The tertiary interactions between EF-Tu and aminoacyl-tRNA have been well investigated. The interacting region is concentrated in the acceptor arm of tRNA (23Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In contrast, structural analysis of SmpB and the TLD of tmRNA revealed that SmpB bound to the upper side of the anticodon stem region (5Gutmann S. Haebel P.W. Metzinger L. Sutter M. Felden B. Ban N. Nature. 2003; 424: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which is opposite the EF-Tu interacting region. Our results indicated that the tmRNA-binding site of SmpB competed with the EF-Tu binding region, which is inconsistent with the structural results. Therefore, to evaluate EF-Tu binding to the alanylated TLD of tmRNA, a tmRNA variant consisting of only the TLD of tmRNA was prepared. The truncated tmRNA with an anticodon corresponding to Ala (GCA or GCG) is shown in Fig. 4A. The efficient charging of the resultant RNA, TLDwAL, with alanine by AlaRS was strongly dependent on SmpB (Fig. 4B). This result indicated that the complex composed of SmpB and TLDwAL, but not the RNA alone, was the AlaRS substrate. EF-Tu binding to the alanyl-TLDwAL was also analyzed. Most surprisingly, EF-Tu did not protect alanyl-TLDwAL in the range of 0.05–0.8 μm, indicating that there was no interaction between EF-Tu and alanyl-TLDwAL (data not shown). However, the addition of 0.2–0.8 μm SmpB to the reaction mixtures containing 0.8 μm EF-Tu protected alanyl-TLDwAL, demonstrating a stimulating effect by SmpB on the binding of EF-Tu to the alanyl-TLD (Fig. 5A). Because SmpB enhanced EF-Tu binding to the alanyl-tmRNA, the protection of alanyl-TLDwAL by EF-Tu in the presence of 0.4 μm SmpB was reevaluated (Fig. 5B). Half-maximal protection occurred in the presence of 0.05–0.1 μm EF-Tu, similar to the results obtained with intact tmRNA, and 0.8 μm EF-Tu was sufficient to protect almost all of the alanyl-TLDwAL, indicating that the EF-Tu concentration was saturable in the experiment in Fig. 5A. Fig. 5A also indicated that, as with intact tmRNA, high concentrations of SmpB dissociated EF-Tu from alanyl-TLD, demonstrating that two molecules of SmpB could bind to the TLD of tmRNA. The tighter binding of SmpB that stimulated EF-Tu binding to the aminoacyl moiety of the alanyl-TLD may have been the canonical binding to the upper side of the anticodon stem, as visualized in the crystal structure of the complex consisting of the TLD and SmpB (5Gutmann S. Haebel P.W. Metzinger L. Sutter M. Felden B. Ban N. Nature. 2003; 424: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The looser binding that competed with EF-Tu for the TLD may have been the alternative binding to the acceptor arm region. The same experiment was carried out using alanylated tRNAAla. Fig. 5C shows that this alternative binding to the acceptor arm region may be general to the TLD structure. These results suggested that at least two SmpB molecules could bind to the TLD of tmRNA, and the competitive binding of SmpB and EF-Tu to the intact alanyl-tmRNA was due not to the canonical binding but to alternative binding to the TLD. To test this hypothesis, the effect of SmpB on the protection of alanyl-tmRNA was reevaluated using higher concentrations of alanyl-tmRNA and EF-Tu. As shown in Fig. 3C, in the presence of 4 μm EF-Tu, a semi-saturable concentration for the protection of 20 nm alanyl-tmRNA, a small amount of SmpB (∼0.5 μm) actually promoted EF-Tu binding to the alanyl-tmRNA, although the effect was less than for the alanyl-TLD (Fig. 5A). Equimolar amounts of SmpB and EF-Tu resulted in the complete dissociation of EF-Tu from the alanyl-tmRNA, in agreement with the previous result (Fig. 3A). These observations showed that the canonical binding SmpB, in which the Kd value was reported to be ∼1 nm for intact tmRNA (12Sundermeier T.R. Dulebohn D.P. Cho H.J. Karzai A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), could occur and stimulate EF-Tu binding of both the alanyl-tmRNA and the alanyl-TLD. However, this canonical binding of SmpB had very little effect on the binding of EF-Tu to the intact tmRNA, because EF-Tu itself bound well to the intact alanyl-tmRNA in the absence of SmpB (Fig. 3A).

We have examined primary murine interleukin-7-dependent bone marrow-derived pro-B cells, where IFNβ, but not IFNα, induces programmed cell death (PCD). IFNβ-stimulated apoptosis is the same in pro-B cells derived from wild type and Stat1–/– mice. However, in pro-B cells from Tyk2–/– mice, where there is normal activation of Stat1 and Stat2, IFNβ-stimulated PCD is not observed. Loss of B cells in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-infected mice has been shown to be mediated through the expression of IFNα/β (1Binder D. Fehr J. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. J. Exp.

In wild type mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, there is a greater loss of B cells in the bone marrow and spleen than in Tyk2–/– mice infected with the virus, suggesting that the expression of this kinase plays an in vivo role in IFNα/β-mediated PCD. In contrast to IFNβ-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2, Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation is defective in Tyk2–/– pro-B cells, suggesting that this Stat family member is required for apoptosis. In support of this hypothesis, inhibition of Stat3 activation in wild type B cells reverses the apoptotic effects of IFNβ. Furthermore, expression of a constitutively active form of Stat3 in Tyk2–/– B cells partially restores IFNβ-stimulated PCD.

The antiviral, antigrowth, and immunomodulatory activities of interferons (IFNs), 2The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; PCD, programmed cell death; LCMV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus; IL, interleukin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CA, constitutively active; DN, dominant negative; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting.2The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; PCD, programmed cell death; LCMV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus; IL, interleukin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CA, constitutively active; DN, dominant negative; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting. appear to be controlled, in part, by a set of cellular genes that are rapidly induced upon the binding of type 1 interferons (IFNα/β) or type 2 interferon (IFNγ) to specific cell surface receptors. Type 1 IFNs consist of several subtypes of IFNα, a single gene encoding IFNβ as well as IFNτ and IFNλ. These cytokines bind to a common receptor composed of two subunits, IFNaR1 and IFNaR2. In most systems, the actions of IFNα and IFNβ are similar; however, there are reports that IFNβ and IFNα can stimulate distinct sets of genes and selectively regulate different biological responses (2Rani M.R.S. Ransohoff R.M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2005; 25: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interferon-stimulated gene factors mediate gene induction by binding to enhancers found within the promoters of type 1 IFN-induced early response genes (3Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 4Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Src homology 2 domain-containing transcription factors called Stats are required for the activation of genes by IFNs. These transcription factors are covalently modified by tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequently translocate to the nucleus such that they interact with enhancers needed for interferon-stimulated gene expression. The Jak family of tyrosine kinases is also an integral component in these signaling cascades (5Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Expression of both Jak1 and Tyk2 is required for type 1 IFN activation of Stats in human cells, whereas in mouse cells, the actions of type 1 IFNs are only partially dependent upon Tyk2 (6Shimoda K. Kato K. Aoki K. Matsuda T. Miyamoto A. Shibamori M. Yamashita M. Numata A. Takase K. Kobayashi S. Shibata S. Asana Y. Gondo H. Sekiguchi K. Nakayama K. Nakayama T. Okamura T. Okamura S. Niho Y.

The biological consequences of type 1 IFN activation of Stat3 in most cells are not clear. Type 1 IFNs are inhibitors of cell growth and are presently used for the treatment of leukemias and other malignancies, such as melanomas and renal cell carcinomas. Although it is clear that type 1 IFN activation of the Jak/Stat pathway is required for their antiproliferative effects (8Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Schreiber R.D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7673-7678Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), it is not clear what role, if any, this signaling cascade plays in determining whether type 1 IFNs stimulate cell cycle arrest, a slowing of the cell cycle without accumulation in a single phase of the cell cycle, or induction of programmed cell death (PCD). In Daudi cells, a human Burkitt lymphoma B cell line, cells are arrested at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle after treatment with IFNα, whereas in the human leukemic Jurkat cell line, IFNα causes a slowing of the cell cycle without inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (9Petricoin E.F.

Nature. 1997; 390: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Daudi cells show a suppression of the DNA binding activity of the E2F transcription factor as well as decreased levels of phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (10Melamed D. Tiefenbrun N.

A variety of hematopoiesis-derived T and B cell lines, certain melanomas, and other cell lines derived from solid tumors have been reported to undergo apoptosis when incubated with type 1 IFNs (12Sangfelt O.

Cooper M.D. Immunity. 1995; 3: 475-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The best described system to examine type 1 IFN-stimulated apoptosis of primary cells is murine IL-7-dependent bone marrow-derived B cells. These pro-B cells show both inhibited cell growth as well as apoptosis when incubated with a combination of virally produced IFNα and IFNβ for 24–48 h. Similar effects of this mixture of cytokines are seen in several IL-7-dependent murine pro-B cell lines (16Wang J. Lin Q. Langston H. Cooper M.D. Immunity. 1995; 3: 475-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Two reports using mice support in vitro studies concerning the ability of type 1 IFN to inhibit the expression of pro-B cells in vivo. IFNα treatment of newborn mice inhibits the development of both T and B cell populations, and infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) causes a transient bone marrow aplasia due to the production of type 1 IFNs (1Binder D. Fehr J. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 17Lin Q. Dong C. Cooper M.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In both of these reports, the actions of either IFNα or infection of mice with LCMV did not occur in mice where the IFNaR1 subunit of the type 1 IFN receptor was deleted. It remains to be determined whether under these same conditions type 1 IFNs inhibit cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. IFN β-mediated inhibition of cell growth in primary murine pro-B cells does not require the expression of Stat1 but appears to require IFNα-stimulated expression and translocation of Daxx (18Gongora R. Stephan R.P. Zhang Z. Cooper M.D. Immunity. 2001; 14: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Daxx expression has been associated with Fas-regulated apoptosis. This protein has been found in promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies as well as in the cytoplasm. IFNα-mediated induction of Daxx does not require the expression of Fas and appears to be blunted in Tyk2–/– cells (18Gongora R. Stephan R.P. Zhang Z. Cooper M.D. Immunity. 2001; 14: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Shimoda K. Kamesaki K. Numata A. Aoki K. Matsuda T. Oritani K. Tamiya S. Kato K. Takase K.

Previous studies have indicated that in the presence of vanadate, IFNα can stimulate PCD in a variety of tissue culture cells, whereas treatment with IFNα alone slows cell growth without inducing apoptosis (20Gamero A.M. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13547-13553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the human 2fTGH fibrosarcoma cell mutant that does not express the tyrosine kinase Tyk2, the apoptotic actions of IFNα and vanadate are lost. If these Tyk2–/– cells are reconstituted with wild type Tyk2, but not kinase-inactive Tyk2, IFNα + vanadate-stimulated PCD is restored. This observation was interesting, because expression of the kinase-inactive form of Tyk2 does restore IFNα-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2 and the induction of early response genes that are controlled by these transcription factors (21Rani M.R.S. Leaman D.W. Han Y. Leung S. Croze E. Fish E.N. Wolfman A. Ransohoff R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32507-32511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, incubation of cells that express kinase-inactive Tyk2 with IFNα does not restore tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3. Given that the kinase-active form of Tyk2 is required for IFNα + vanadate-stimulated PCD, it is likely that other events in addition to activation of Stat1-dependent genes must also be needed for this event. These results provided a clue to a potential role of type 1 IFN-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 as it relates to the biological actions of this cytokine. Stat3 activation was also implicated in a report examining an uncharacterized Daudi cell variant that is insensitive to the antigrowth and antiviral actions of type one interferons (22Yang C.-H. Murti A. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this study, we confirm that IFNβ-stimulated PCD of primary pro-B cells requires the expression of Tyk2 in vitro, and these results are also seen in mice infected with LCMV. Our studies also implicate Stat3 as a key regulator of IFNβ-stimulated apoptosis of pro-B cells. Although Stat3 has been known for several years to be activated by type 1 IFNs, this is one of the first studies that documents a physiological role of IFNα/β-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of this transcription factor in primary cells. Cell Culture and Reagents—Murine IL-7-dependent bone marrow-derived pro-B cells were isolated from 129Sv mice and the various mice deficient in Stat1, Stat 1, 5a/b, and Tyk2, as described (23Gongora R. Stephan R.P. Schreiber R.D. Cooper M.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2362-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). IL-7 was present at all times in the experiments described here. Murine IFNβ was prepared as described (24Sakamoto S. Qin J. Navarro A. Gamero A. Potla R. Yi T. Zhu W. Baker D.P. Feldman G. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3245-3253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Murine IFNα was a generous gift of Dr. Ernest Borden. Antibodies and Chemical Reagents—Anti-Stat1, anti-Stat2, and anti-Stat3 antisera were used as described previously (25Gamero A.M. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16574-17578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Anti-phosphospecific Stat1, Stat2, and Stat3 were purchased from Cell Signaling. Stat3 blocking peptide was obtained from Calbiochem and used at a final concentration of 500 μm (26Turkson J. Ryan D. Kim J.S. Zhang Y. Chen Z. Haura E. Laudano A. Sebti S. Hamilton A.D. Jove R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45443-45455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Preparation of Whole Cell and Cytoplasmic Extracts—Cells were lysed in whole cell extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm NaF, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). After centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min, supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad/Bradford protein assay. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Immunoblots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of Apoptosis by Annexin V Staining—Cells were left untreated or incubated with type 1 IFNs (1000 units/ml) for various times at 37 °C. Cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2). Cells were then incubated with 5 μl of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate or PE (Pharmingen, Palo Alto, CA) for 10 min at room temperature in the dark, followed by the addition of 400 μl of binding buffer. Cells were collected ungated (10,000 events) and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan™ (BD Biosciences). Data were further analyzed using CellQuest™ (BD Biosciences). Expression of Tyk2 Is Required for IFNβ-mediated Apoptosis of Murine Pro-B Cells—To examine the role of Tyk2 in IFNβ-stimulated apoptosis, we studied primary bone marrow-derived IL-7-dependent pro-B cells, since they have been shown previously to undergo PCD in the presence of a combination of IFNα and IFNβ (16Wang J. Lin Q. Langston H. Cooper M.D. Immunity. 1995; 3: 475-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in Stat1–/– pro-B cells, the antigrowth effects of type 1 IFNs are intact, whereas in Tyk2–/– cells, the antigrowth effects of IFNβ are lost (19Shimoda K. Kamesaki K. Numata A. Aoki K. Matsuda T. Oritani K. Tamiya S. Kato K. Takase K. Imamura R. Yamamoto T. Miyamoto T. Nagafuji K. Gondo H. Nagafuchi S. Nakayama K. Harada M. J.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 2362-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These reports, however, did not address the issue of type 1 IFN-stimulated apoptosis in pro-B cells. To examine whether IFNβ-stimulated PCD in pro-B cells requires the expression of Stat1 and Tyk2, we isolated IL-7-dependent pro-B cells from bone marrow of Tyk2–/–, Stat1–/–, and Stat1,5a,b–/– mice. Since the genetic background of each knock-out mouse varied, B cells from wild type littermates were used to confirm that IFNβ-mediated apoptotic responses were intact. IFNβ-stimulated apoptosis in pro-B cells isolated from mice with different genetic backgrounds did not significantly differ (data not shown). Cells were incubated with or without IFNβ (1000 units/ml) or IFNγ (10 ng/ml) for 36 h. IL-7 was present during all incubations. Apoptosis was assayed by staining with annexin V. (Table 1). Both IFNβ and IFNγ stimulated apoptosis in pro-B cells from wild type mice. Induction of PCD by IFNβ was also observed in cells from mice that do not express Stat1 or Stat1,5a,b. In contrast, IFNγ was not able to stimulate PCD in cells from Stat1–/– or Stat1,5a,b–/– mice. Cells isolated from mice that do not express Tyk2 showed normal induction of apoptosis in the presence of IFNγ, but IFNβ-induced apoptosis was absent. Similar results were observed using terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assays (data not shown). Interestingly, the antiproliferative actions of IFNβ are present but are not as pronounced in Tyk2–/– pro-B cells when compared with wild type pro-B cell counterparts. The difference in the antigrowth effects of IFNβ in wild type compared with Tyk2–/– cells is approximately the percentage of annexin V-positive cells seen in wild type cells incubated with IFNβ (Table 2). These results differ from those of Shi-moda et al. (19Shimoda K. Kamesaki K. Numata A. Aoki K. Matsuda T. Oritani K. Tamiya S. Kato K. Takase K. Imamura R. Yamamoto T. Miyamoto T. Nagafuji K.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 4707-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), who observed no antiproliferative effects of type 1 IFNs in bone marrow cells from Tyk2–/– mice. However, they were not isolating the same population of bone marrow cells used in these assays.TABLE 1Interferon-induced apoptosis in murine IL-7-dependent pro-B cellsMouse genotypeIFNβIFNγWild type28 ± 422 ± 3Stat1-/-24 ± 50Stat1-/-Stat5a-/-, Stat5b-/-40 ± 70Tyk2-/-024 ± 3 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Antigrowth and apoptotic actions of IFNβ in murine IL-7-dependent pro-B cellsApoptosisCell count (growth inhibition)%%Wild type22 ± 265 ± 5Tyk2-/-4 ± 336 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Previous studies examining the actions of type 1 IFNs on PCD of pro-B cells have used either a combination of IFNα and IFNβ isolated from virally infected cells or recombinant IFNα (16Wang J.

We wanted to examine whether there were any differential actions of IFNα and IFNβ on apoptosis of pro-B cells. Cells isolated from wild type mice were incubated with or without recombinant murine IFNα or recombinant IFNβ for 48 h, and numbers of cells were counted or cells were stained with annexin V (Table 3). Cells incubated with either IFNβ or IFNα displayed about 50 and 34% fewer cells, respectively, than untreated cells. However, only cells treated with IFNβ were annexin V-positive. Although this finding was somewhat surprising, since most of the actions of IFNα and IFNβ appear to be similar, there are a number of reports suggesting that the actions of these two IFNs can be selective with regard to the activation of immediate early genes as well as their antiviral and antiproliferative actions (for a review, see Ref. 2Rani M.R.S.

Pools of cells that stably express either GFP or Tyk2-GFP were obtained by FACS sorting, and these cells were incubated without or with IFNβ for 48 h. The amount of apoptosis was then determined by annexin V staining (Fig. 1). Tyk2-null cells that express only GFP are resistant to IFNβ-stimulated apoptosis, whereas wild type or Tyk2-null pro-B cells reconstituted with Tyk2 showed equivalent degrees of IFNβ-stimulated apoptosis. These results demonstrate that the mechanisms by which IFNβ and IFNγ induce PCD are distinct, although they both use Stat1 as a transcription factor to regulate a variety of their biological actions. Furthermore, expression of Tyk2 is required for the apoptotic actions of IFNβ. This result is surprising in light of reports that activation of Stat1 and Stat2, as well as antiviral effects of IFNα, are similar in wild type and Tyk2–/–mice (6Shimoda K. Kato K. Aoki K.

IFNβ-induced Apoptosis of Pro-B Cells Requires Activation of Stat3—Previous studies have indicated that there is a selective defect in IFNα-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 in Tyk2–/– bone marrow-derived macrophages, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 is normal in cells incubated with IFNγ, IL-12, IL-6, and IL-10 (6Shimoda K.

We wanted to confirm these findings in primary B cells that were used for the apoptosis assays. Cell extracts were prepared from wild type, Stat1–/–, Stat1, 5a/b–/–, and Tyk2–/– pro-B cells that had been incubated with or without IFNβ (1000 units/ml) for 20 min. Immunoblots were probed with phosphotyrosine-specific Stat1 antiserum (Fig. 2A top panel) and also with Stat1 antiserum to ensure equal loading of protein (Fig. 2A, bottom). As reported by Shimoda et al. (6Shimoda K. Kato K. Aoki K. Matsuda T. Miyamoto A. Shibamori M. Yamashita M. Numata A. Takase K. Kobayashi S. Shibata S. Asana Y. Gondo H. Sekiguchi K. Nakayama K.

Immunity. 2000; 13: 549-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), using primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, we detected comparable levels of IFNβ-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 in pro-B cells from wild type and Tyk2–/– mice. We next examined IFNβ-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 (Fig. 2B, top). Whereas IFNβ-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 was observed in wild type, Stat1–/–, and Stat1,5a,b–/– pro-B cells, we were unable to detect any tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 in Tyk2–/– pro-B cells. IFNβ-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 in the Tyk2-null B cells was examined after a variety of incubation times (10–60 min) with the cytokine to ensure that there was no change in the kinetics of activation. These findings correlate with an absence of IFNα/β-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 in bone marrow-derived macrophages isolated from Tyk2-null mice (7Karaghiosoff M. Neubauer H.

Immunity. 2000; 13: 549-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). As mentioned earlier, in 2fTGH cells that do not express Tyk2 or express a kinase-inactive Tyk2, IFNα-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and IFNα + vanadate-induced PCD are not observed (20Gamero A.M. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13547-13553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Rani M.R.S. Leaman D.W. Han Y. Leung S. Croze E. Fish E.N. Wolfman A.

The loss of IFNβ-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 in Tyk2–/– pro-B cells and its activation in all other B cells where IFNβ stimulates PCD suggests that Tyk2 may mediate some or all of its apoptotic actions through changes in the phosphorylation state of Stat3. To directly address this issue, we infected primary bone marrow-derived B cells from wild type mice with constructs that express either GFP or constitutively active (CA) or dominant negative (DN) Stat3 (27McLemore M.L. Grewal S. Liu F. Archambault A. Poursine-Luarent J. Haug J. Link D.C. Immunity. 2001; 14: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). CA-Stat3 contains two substitutions of cysteines in its Src homology 2 domain, which results in spontaneous dimerization of the protein (28Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgam G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2486) Google Scholar). Pools of cells that stably express GFP were obtained by FACS, and these cells were incubated without or with IFNβ for 48 h. The amount of apoptosis was then determined by annexin V staining (Table 4). Pro-B cells that express either GFP or GFP-CA STAT3 showed approximately a 50% increase in annexin V-positive cells following treatment with IFNβ compared with untreated samples. However, pro-B cells that expressed GFP-DN Stat3 showed only a 20% increase in annexin V-positive staining compared with untreated samples. The basal apoptosis in each pool of cells was approximately the same (5%). To determine the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3, each of the pools of infected cells was incubated with IFNβ for 30 min. Cell lysates were then subjected to Western blotting with phosphotyrosine-specific Stat3 anti-serum (Fig. 3, middle). Cells expressing MSCV-GFP showed induction in tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 after incubation with IFNβ (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and 2). This induction is decreased about 50% in cells expressing DN Stat3 (Fig. 3, compare lanes 2 and 4), whereas cells expressing CA Stat3 show a basal level of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 that is further increased by incubation of cells with the cytokine (Fig. 3, compare lanes 5 and 6). The partial decrease in tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 in cells expressing the dominant negative form of the protein correlates with the partial but significant decrease in IFNβ-stimulated apoptosis seen in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2041127248,"In female heterogamous (ZW) species, sex-linked genes coding for maternal products that are packaged into the egg open a unique arena for genetic conflict that does not occur in male heterogamous (XY) species. Z-linked maternal-effect alleles that help sons and harm daughters are expected to go to fixation, as are W-linked alleles that help daughters and harm sons. This conflict differs from known cases of meiotic drive, because sex-specific ontogeny, physiology, and gene expression greatly simplify the genetic interactions that lead to sexual conflict. Selection on maternal-effect genes may substantially alter the evolution of ZW compared with XY systems."
