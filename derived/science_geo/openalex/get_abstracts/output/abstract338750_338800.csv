https://openalex.org/W1969324628,"Geographical curves are so involved in their detail that their lengths are often infinite or, rather, undefinable. However, many are statistically ""selfsimilar,"" meaning that each portion can be considered a reduced-scale image of the whole. In that case, the degree of complication can be described by a quantity D that has many properties of a ""dimension,"" though it is fractional; that is, it exceeds the value unity associated with the ordinary, rectifiable, curves."
https://openalex.org/W2093739403,"Geographic range has been regarded as a property of species rather than of individuals and thus as a potential factor in macroevolutionary processes. Species durations in Late Cretaceous mollusks exhibit statistically significant positive relationships with geographic range, and the attainment of a typical frequency distribution of geographic ranges in the cohort of species that originated just before the end-Cretaceous extinction indicates that species duration is the dependent variable. The strong relation between geographic ranges in pairs of closely related species indicates that the trait is, in effect, heritable at the species level. The significant heritabilities strengthen claims for processes of evolution by species-level selection, and for differential survivorship of organismic-level traits owing to extinction and origination processes operating at higher levels."

https://openalex.org/W2065887186,The microstructure of superconducting films that have shown high-critical current densities has been studied. The films are shown to be epitaxial and contain twins and precipitates. The main difference between these films and low current carrying samples is the absence of grain boundaries. These boundaries are therefore identified as the cause of the lower critical current in ceramic samples.

It is closely associated with mathematical knowledge, which forms the basis of intuition. This knowledge contributes to the growth of intuition and is in turn increased by new conceptual materials suggested by intuition. The major role of intuition is to provide a conceptual foundation that suggests the directions which new research should take. The opinion of the individual mathematician regarding existence of mathematical concepts (number, geometric notions, and the like) are provided by this intuition; these opinions are frequently so firmly held as to merit the appellation ""Platonic."" The role of intuition in research is to provide the ""educated guess,"" which may prove to be true or false; but in either case, progress cannot be made without it and even a false guess may lead to progress. Thus intuition also plays a major role in the evolution of mathematical concepts. The advance of mathematical knowledge periodically reveals flaws in cultural intuition; these result in ""crises,"" the solution of which result in a more mature intuition. The ultimate basis of modern mathematics is thus mathematical intuition. and it is in this sense that the Intuitionistic doctrine of Brouwer and his followers is correct. Modern instructional methods recognize this role of intuition by replacing the ""do this, do that"" mode of teaching by a ""what should be done next?"" attitude which appeals to the intuitive background already developed. It is in this way that understanding and appreciation of new mathematical knowledge may be properly instilled in the student."
https://openalex.org/W2068978039,"Several high-intensity synchrotron x-ray sources have been constructed over the past few years in the United States, West Germany, Great Britain, Japan, France, Italy, and the Soviet Union. Crystallographers have begun to use these facilities for experiments that take advantage of the characteristics of synchrotron radiation, namely, a broad distribution of wavelengths, high intensity, low divergence, strong polarization, and a pulsed time structure. In addition to more familiar diffraction experiments on single crystals and powdered samples, new types of crystallographic studies, for example, energy-dispersive and surface diffraction studies, have progressed rapidly with more general accessibility of synchrotron sources. These high-intensity sources allow diffraction experiments to be performed on very small crystals or on large biological molecules, and permit weak magnetic scattering to be detected Anomalous dispersion experiments can exploit he ability to vary the wavelength of the radiation, and the pulsed time structure of the beam makes possible fast time-resolved experiments. Because of the availability of synchrotron x-radiation, these and other kinds of experiments will be in the forefront of crystallographic research for the next several years."
