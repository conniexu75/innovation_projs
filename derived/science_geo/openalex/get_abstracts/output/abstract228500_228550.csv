https://openalex.org/W2144654038,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful new tool with which to perform loss-of-function genetic screens in lower organisms and can greatly facilitate the identification of components of cellular signalling pathways. In mammalian cells, such screens have been hampered by a lack of suitable tools that can be used on a large scale. We and others have recently developed expression vectors to direct the synthesis of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that act as short interfering RNA (siRNA)-like molecules to stably suppress gene expression. Here we report the construction of a set of retroviral vectors encoding 23,742 distinct shRNAs, which target 7,914 different human genes for suppression. We use this RNAi library in human cells to identify one known and five new modulators of p53-dependent proliferation arrest. Suppression of these genes confers resistance to both p53-dependent and p19ARF-dependent proliferation arrest, and abolishes a DNA-damage-induced G1 cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, we describe siRNA bar-code screens to rapidly identify individual siRNA vectors associated with a specific phenotype. These new tools will greatly facilitate large-scale loss-of-function genetic screens in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2104711019,"Our studies demonstrate that the ABC transporter and marker of stem and progenitor cells known as the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP or ABCG2) confers a strong survival advantage under hypoxic conditions. We show that, under hypoxia, progenitor cells from Bcrp(-)/(-)mice have a reduced ability to form colonies as compared with progenitor cells from Bcrp(+/+) mice. Blocking BCRP function in Bcrp(+/+) progenitor cells markedly reduces survival under hypoxic conditions. However, blocking heme biosynthesis reverses the hypoxic susceptibility of Bcrp(-/-) progenitor cells, a finding that indicates that heme molecules (i.e. porphyrins) are detrimental to Bcrp(-/-) cells under hypoxia. BCRP specifically binds heme, and cells lacking BCRP accumulate porphyrins. Finally, Bcrp expression is up-regulated by hypoxia, and we demonstrate that this up-regulation involves the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor complex HIF-1. Collectively, our findings suggest that cells can, upon hypoxic demand, use BCRP to reduce heme or porphyrin accumulation, which can be detrimental to cells. Our findings have implications for the survival of stem cells and tumor cells in hypoxic environments."

https://openalex.org/W2090510390,"Peripheral inflammation involves an increase in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-mediated prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in the central nervous system (CNS), which contributes to allodynia and hyperalgesia. In the present study we have determined the changes in prostanoid tissue levels and in expression of terminal prostanoid synthases in both the CNS and inflamed peripheral tissue during carrageenan-induced paw inflammation in the rat. Prostanoid levels were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and enzyme expression at the RNA level by quantitative PCR analysis during both the early (1-6 h) and late (12 and 24 h) phases of the inflammatory response. In the paw, the early phase was associated with increases in PGE2 and thromboxane (TX)B2 levels and with a peak of COX-2 expression that preceded that of microsomal prostaglandin-E2 synthase-1 (mPGES-1). COX-2 and mPGES-1 remained elevated during the late phase, and PGE2 continued to further increase through 24 h. The cytosolic PGE2 synthase (cPGES) showed a small transient increase during the early phase, whereas mPGES-2 expression was not affected by inflammation. In the cerebrospinal fluid, elevated levels of PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1α, PGD2, and TXB2 were detected during the early phase. PGE2 levels also increased in the spinal cord and, to a lesser extent, in the brain and remained elevated in both the cerebrospinal fluid and the spinal cord during the late phase. The expression of mPGES-1 was strongly up-regulated in the brain and spinal cord during inflammation, whereas no change was detected for the expression of cPGES, mPGES-2, COX-1, and terminal PGD, TX, or PGI synthases. The results show that the carrageenan-induced edema in the paw elicits an early phase of COX-2 induction in the CNS leading to an increase synthesis in PGD2, 6-keto-PGF1α, and TXB2 in addition to the major PGE2 response. The data also indicate that the up-regulation of mPGES-1 contributes to COX-2-mediated PGE2 production in the CNS during peripheral inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W1976433941,"Resorption of amino acids in kidney and intestine is mediated by transporters, which prefer groups of amino acids with similar physico-chemical properties. It is generally assumed that most neutral amino acids are transported across the apical membrane of epithelial cells by system B0. Here we have characterized a novel member of the Na+-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family (B0AT1) isolated from mouse kidney, which shows all properties of system B0. Flux experiments showed that the transporter is Na+-dependent, electrogenic, and actively transports most neutral amino acids but not anionic or cationic amino acids. Superfusion of mB0AT1-expressing oocytes with neutral amino acids generated inward currents, which were proportional to the fluxes observed with labeled amino acids. In situ hybridization showed strong expression in intestinal microvilli and in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Expression of mouse B0AT1 was restricted to kidney, intestine, and skin. It is generally assumed that mutations of the system B0 transporter underlie autosomal recessive Hartnup disorder. In support of this notion mB0AT1 is located on mouse chromosome 13 in a region syntenic to human chromosome 5p15, the locus of Hartnup disorder. Thus, the human homologue of this transporter is an excellent functional and positional candidate for Hartnup disorder.

Thus, the human homologue of this transporter is an excellent functional and positional candidate for Hartnup disorder. Epithelial resorption of amino acids across the apical membrane in the kidney and intestine is thought to be carried out by four different transporters (1Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Google Scholar). Anionic amino acids are taken up by a Na+-dependent aspartate/glutamate transporter, which has been designated system X-AG. Molecular cloning has identified this transporter as EAAT3 (2Kanai Y. Stelzner M. Nussberger S. Khawaja S. Hebert S.C. Smith C.P. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20599-20606Google Scholar). Cationic amino acids are taken up by system b0,+; the molecular correlate of this transporter being the heteromeric amino acid transporter rBAT/b0,+AT (3Palacin M. Borsani G. Sebastio G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 328-335Google Scholar). Proline and glycine are thought to be transported by the IMINO system (4Stevens B.R. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 87: 27-34Google Scholar), and it has recently been proposed that the molecular correlate of this transporter may be the proton-dependent amino acid transporter PAT1 (5Chen Z. Fei Y.J. Anderson C.M. Wake K.A. Miyauchi S. Huang W. Thwaites D.T. Ganapathy V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 546: 349-361Google Scholar). Most neutral amino acids are thought to be transported by system B0, which has not yet been identified at the molecular level (6Broer S. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 444: 457-466Google Scholar, 7Chillaron J. Estevez R. Mora C. Wagner C.A. Suessbrich H. Lang F. Gelpi J.L. Testar X. Busch A.E. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17761-17770Google Scholar). System B0 has been characterized in jejunal brush border vesicles (8Stevens B.R. Ross H.J. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 66: 213-225Google Scholar, 9Maenz D.D. Patience J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22079-22086Google Scholar, 10Munck B.G. Munck L.K. J. Physiol. 1994; 480: 99-107Google Scholar), bovine epithelial cells (11Doyle F.A. McGivan J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1104: 55-62Google Scholar), and Caco-2 cells (12Souba W.W. Pan M. Stevens B.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 746-753Google Scholar). These studies suggest that system B0 is a Na+-dependent, chloride-independent transporter that accepts a wide variety of neutral amino acids. Failures to resorb amino acids in the kidney and intestine underlie a number of inherited transporter diseases, with mutations in either rBAT or b0,+AT causing cystinuria (13Palacin M. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 547-553Google Scholar), mutations of the IMINO system believed to cause iminoglycinuria (14Chesney R.W. Scriver C.H. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases. 3. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 4971-4982Google Scholar), and mutations of system B0 thought to cause Hartnup disorder (15Levy L.L. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases. 3. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 4957-4969Google Scholar). Hartnup disorder (MIM 234500) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from impaired neutral amino acid transport, largely limited to the kidneys and the small intestine. Its diagnostic hallmark is a striking neutral hyperaminoaciduria (15Levy L.L. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases. 3. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 4957-4969Google Scholar, 16Baron D.N. Dent C.E. Harris H. Hart E.W. Jepson J.B. Lancet. 1956; 2: 421-428Google Scholar). A number of additional symptoms have been reported in Hartnup disorder patients, including photosensitive skin rash, ataxia, and psychotic behavior (15Levy L.L. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases. 3. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 4957-4969Google Scholar, 16Baron D.N. Dent C.E. Harris H. Hart E.W. Jepson J.B. Lancet. 1956; 2: 421-428Google Scholar). Nevertheless, many of those affected remain asymptomatic despite the hyperaminoaciduria. This variation in manifestations of Hartnup disorder may be a consequence of compensation for the reduced amino acid transport by increased peptide transport in the intestine or the presence of genetic or environmental modifiers, such as dietary variations. Despite its apparently mild phenotype, Hartnup disorder has been a model disease, because it illustrates the principles of amino acid resorption in epithelial cells. Homozygosity mapping in consanguineous families has recently localized the disorder to chromosome 5p15 (17Nozaki J. Dakeishi M. Ohura T. Inoue K. Manabe M. Wada Y. Koizumi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 255-260Google Scholar). Here we describe the cloning and characterization of a neutral amino acid transporter from mouse kidney, which belongs to the family of Na+- and Cl--dependent neurotransmitter transporters, has all the functional hallmarks of system B0, and is expressed mainly in kidney and intestine. Its human homologue is found on chromosome 5p15. It is suggested that the human homologue of this gene is an excellent candidate for Hartnup disorder. cDNA Cloning and Plasmids—Total RNA was isolated from mouse kidney by the acid-guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). For cloning of mouse B0AT1, 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)15 was added to 1.5 μg of kidney RNA in a total volume of 4.5 μl. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 65 °C and then chilled on ice. Reverse transcription was carried out in a buffer designed to improve the temperature stability of reverse transcriptase (19Carninci P. Nishiyama Y. Westover A. Itoh M. Nagaoka S. Sasaki N. Okazaki Y. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 520-524Google Scholar). The reaction was assembled by adding the following components to the RNA mixture: 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 1 μl of dNTPs (each 10 mm), 0.5 μl of 40× reverse transcriptase buffer, 30 units of RNaseout (Invitrogen), 10 μl of 1.8 m trehalose, 2 μl of 100% glycerol. The mixture (20 μl) was then incubated at 42 °C for 2 min. For cDNA synthesis 200 units of Superscript II-RT (Invitrogen) was added followed by incubation at 55 °C for 1 h. The cDNA was purified by using a PCR product purification kit (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, VIC, Australia). For PCR a proofreading polymerase was used (Pfu polymerase, Promega, Madison, WI). The coding sequence was amplified during 30 PCR cycles with the temperature profile 94 °C 30 s, 55 °C 60 s, and 72 °C 12 min using the sense primer 5′-GAC ACA ACC ACT TGC CCT TT and the antisense primer 5′-GTC CTG CAT CTT GCT TCC TC. The final 11 base pairs of the sense primer correspond to bases 1–11 of the mouse cDNA clone XM_127449 (Riken cDNA 4632401C08). The antisense primer corresponds to bases 2005–2024 of the same cDNA clone. The amplified PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the 2033-bp fragment was isolated using a gel elution kit (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, VIC, Australia). The isolated PCR fragment was initially cloned using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). The mouse B0AT1 sequence was determined by BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing using conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and an ABI 3730 capillary genetic analyzer (Biomolecular Resource Facility, Australian National University). Its sequence is deposited as AJ633679 in the EMBL data base. For expression studies, mouse B0AT1 was excised with HindIII-XbaI and inserted into the same sites of the oocyte expression vector pGEM-He-Juel (20Broer S. Rahman B. Pellegri G. Pellerin L. Martin J.L. Verleysdonk S. Hamprecht B. Magistretti P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30096-30102Google Scholar). Oocytes and Injections—Oocyte isolation and management have been described in detail elsewhere (21Broer S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 227: 245-258Google Scholar). For expression in oocytes mouse B0AT1 in pGem-He-Juel was linearized with SalI and transcribed in vitro using the T7 mMessage mMachine Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Oocytes were injected with 20 ng of cRNA encoding mouse B0AT1. Transport measurements were carried out after 3–6 days of expression. Flux Measurements—For each determination, groups of 7–10 cRNA or non-injected oocytes were washed twice with 4 ml of ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, titrated with NaOH to pH 7.4 unless indicated otherwise) before incubation at room temperature in a 5-ml polypropylene tube containing 70 μl of the same buffer supplemented with 14C-labeled amino acids and different amounts of unlabeled substrate. Transport was stopped after different time intervals by washing oocytes 3 times with 4 ml of ice-cold ND96 buffer. Single oocytes were placed into scintillation vials and lysed by the addition of 200 μl of 10% SDS. After lysis, 3 ml of scintillation fluid was added, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. In Na+-free incubation buffer NaCl was replaced by NMDG 1The abbreviations used are: NMDG, N-methyl-d-glucamine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; RT, reverse transcription; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid. -Cl or LiCl. To determine the dependence of transport activity on the Na+ concentration NaCl-ND96 (pH 7.4) was mixed with NMDG-Cl-ND96 (pH 7.4, NaCl was replaced by NMDG-Cl) in different proportions. Different pH values were adjusted by mixing MES-buffered ND96 (5 mm HEPES replaced by 5 mm MES) with Tris-buffered ND96 (5 mm HEPES replaced by 5 mm Tris-base). Uptake of [14C]phenylalanine or [14C]leucine increased linearly with time for up to 20 min. As a result, uptake was determined using an incubation period of 15 min. To determine substrate specificity the following compounds were used (all Amersham Biosciences): [U-14C]phenylalanine, [U-14C]glutamine, [U-14C]alanine, [U-14C]leucine, [U-14C]glycine, [U-14C]arginine, [U-14C]glutamate, [U-14C]histidine, [U-14C]proline, and [U-14C]isoleucine. For competition experiments uptake of 100 μm labeled amino acid was challenged with an excess of 20 mm unlabeled amino acid. Electrophysiological Recordings—Amino acid induced currents were analyzed by two-electrode voltage clamp recording. The recordings were performed with 1× LU and 10× MGU headstages connected to a Geneclamp 500B electronic amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The output signal was amplified 10 times and filtered at 50 Hz. The analog signal was converted into digital figures by a Digidata 1322A (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), and data were sampled at 3Hz using pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Oocytes were chosen that had a membrane potential more negative than -30 mV. Once a stable membrane potential was reached under current clamp conditions, the amplifier was switched to voltage clamp mode holding the oocytes at -50 mV. Oocytes were superfused with ND96 solution with or without saturating amounts of amino acids (5 mm). A complete change of the bath to a new solution was accomplished in about 10 s. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from male adult NRMI mouse tissues by the acid-guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). For reverse transcription 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)15 was added to 2 μg of total RNA in a total volume of 12 μl. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 65 °C and then chilled on ice. Dithiothreitol, dNTPs, 5× reverse transcriptase buffer, and 30 units of RNasin (Promega) were added, and the whole mixture (20 μl) was incubated at 42 °C for 2 min. For cDNA synthesis 200 units of Superscript II-RT (Invitrogen) was added followed by incubation at 42 °C for 1 h. A standard PCR protocol with 100 pmol of each primer anda2-μl aliquot of the purified cDNA was used for amplification of the fragments during 40 cycles (95 °C 30 s; 55 °C 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min) in a Thermocycler using Taq polymerase (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, VIC, Australia). After amplification the samples were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The mB0AT1 specific fragment was amplified with sense primer, 5′-CTTCATGGTGGGCCTGTACT (corresponding to positions 428–447 of XM_127449), and antisense primer, 5′-GTCCTGCATCTTGCTTCCTC(corresponding to positions 2005–2025 of XM_127449). To determine the identity of the amplified fragment it was cloned into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector, and its sequence was determined (Biomolecular Resource Facility, Australian National University). From both kidney and intestine, six clones were isolated, and all sequences were found to be identical to that of XM_127449. A 1-kilobase actin cDNA fragment was amplified during 30 cycles as a control using the sense primer, 5′-GCT CAC CAT GGA TGA TGA TAT CGC-3′, and the antisense primer, 5′-GGA GGA GCA ATG ATC TTG ATC TTC-3′. In Situ Hybridization—Tissue specimens of kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, small intestine, skeletal muscle, lymph nodes, and brain from C57BL/6, SWR/J, and DBA1/J mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 4 h, and embedded in paraffin. Five-μm tissue sections were dewaxed and hybridized as previously described (22Klingel K. Hohenadl C. Canu A. Albrecht M. Seemann M. Mall G. Kandolf R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 314-318Google Scholar). Hybridization probes were generated by in vitro transcription of mB0AT1 cDNA cloned into pCR-blunt II-TOPO using SP6 polymerase (antisense) and T7 polymerase (sense). The hybridization mixture (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50% (v/v) deionized formamide, 600 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 10% dextran sulfate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μg/ml denatured sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 100 μg/ml rabbit liver tRNA) contained either the 35S-labeled RNA antisense or sense control mB0AT1 probe at a concentration of 500 ng/ml. Hybridization with RNA probes proceeded at 42 °C for 18 h. After washing steps, the slide preparations were dipped in NTB2 emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.) and exposed at 4 °C for 3 weeks. After development the slides were stained with hematoxylin/eosin and photographed with a Sony DSC digital camera. Calculations, Statistics, and Computer Analysis—Each data point or bar in the figures and tables represents the mean ± S.D. activity of m = 7–10 mB0AT1-expressing oocytes minus the mean ± S.D. activity of m = 7–10 non-injected oocytes. Kinetic constants were derived by non-linear curve fitting of the means to the corresponding equation using Origin 7.0 software (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). To determine Km and Vmax the Michaelis-Menten equation v = (Vmax × S/(Km + S)) was used. The cotransport stoichiometry was determined by using a linear form of the Hill equation: log(v/(Vmax - v)) = n × log [S] + log Km. The number n of independent experiments is indicated in the figure legends. Throughout the manuscript we show representative figures from one of these experiments. Sequence alignments and the tree were calculated using programs of GCG and PHYLIP packages supplied by the Australian National Genomic Information Service (ANGIS). Sequence alignment was performed using ClustalW (23Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar). Subsequently, protein distance was calculated by using the Dayhoff PAM matrix (24Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar) and converted into a tree diagram using an additive tree model. The peptide sequence of mB0AT1 was analyzed by hydropathy plotting using the TMHMM 2.0 program (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0) and the TMpred program (www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html). The structural plot was computed using the transmembrane protein display software (www.sacs.ucsf.edu/TOPO/topo.html). Cloning of Mouse B0AT1—Hydrophobicity analysis of predicted open reading frames on human chromosome region 5p15 in the NCBI human genome data base and the ENSEMBL data base revealed the presence of only a limited number of proteins with more than five hydrophobic putatively membrane spanning domains (data not shown). Some of these had already been annotated as transporter genes, such as the dopamine transporter (SLC6A3), the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE-3 (SLC9A3), and the potassium chloride cotransporter KCC4 (SLC12A7). These are well characterized transporters and were unlikely to mediate or affect neutral amino acid transport and were not considered valid candidates. Two additional proteins with multiple hydrophobic domains were identified in this region. One of these is XT2, an orphan member of the SLC6 family that does not appear to have a transport activity (25Wasserman J.C. Delpire E. Tonidandel W. Kojima R. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F688-F694Google Scholar, 26Nash S.R. Giros B. Kingsmore S.F. Kim K.M. el-Mestikawy S. Dong Q. Fumagalli F. Seldin M.F. Caron M.G. Receptors Channels. 1998; 6: 113-128Google Scholar). The second lies distal to XT2 on chromosome 5p15 is a close homologue of XT2 and has recently been annotated (NCBI accession number XM_291120). BLAST searches revealed that the mouse homologue of this transporter (94% similarity on the amino acid level) is a cDNA deposited under the accession number XM_127449 in the NCBI data base. Because of its functional properties, which will be described below, we named the mouse cDNA mB0AT1. There were no differences between the coding sequence of mB0AT1 obtained by us and the coding sequence of XM_127449 in the NCBI data base. The genomic localization of mouse B0AT1 is on chromosome 13 in cytoband C1. This region is syntenic to human chromosome 5p15. The transcript is deposited as ENSMUST00000022048 in the EMBL data base (or as locus LOC340024 in the NCBI data base) (27Waterston R.H. Lindblad-Toh K. Birney E. Rogers J. Abril J.F. Agarwal P.

Zody M.C. Lander E.S. Nature. 2002; 420: 520-562Google Scholar). The 12 coding exons span an area of 18920 bp (Fig. 1). Alignment of all mouse members of the SLC6 family reveals that mB0AT1 together with XT2 and XT3, another orphan member of the SLC6 family (26Nash S.R. Giros B. Kingsmore S.F. Kim K.M. el-Mestikawy S. Dong Q. Fumagalli F. Seldin M.F. Caron M.G. Receptors Channels. 1998; 6: 113-128Google Scholar), form a subfamily (Fig. 2). mB0AT1 has 51 and 43% identical amino acids with XT3 and XT2, respectively; all other SLC6 members having between 21 and 35% identical amino acids with mB0AT1. The mouse cDNA has a coding sequence of 1904 bp and encodes a protein of 634 amino acids. Hydropathy analysis indicates the presence of 12 transmembrane domains (Fig. 3A), which is in agreement with the general structure of transporters in the SLC6 family (28Chen N.H. Reith M.E. Quick M.W. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 519-531Google Scholar). However, B0AT1, XT2, and XT3 are predicted to have a larger loop between helix 7 and 8 compared with other members of the SLC6 family. The predicted structure was supported by the exon/intron boundaries, which in membrane proteins are usually found in the sequence between transmembrane domain-encoding regions (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Hydropathy plot and topological model of mB0AT1. A, hydropathy plot of mB0AT1 as calculated by the TMpred program. Predicted transmembrane-spanning domains are numbered. B, topological model of mB0AT1 derived from the combined analysis of several topology predictions. The location of the amino and carboxyl terminus were both postulated to be intracellular in accordance with other members of this family. The transporter is predicted to have 12 transmembrane-spanning domains. Charged residues in the membrane are shaded in gray. Exon/intron boundaries, translated into the peptide sequence, are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Tissue Distribution and Cellular Distribution of mB0AT1— The successful cloning of mB0AT1 from mouse kidney cDNA indicated its presence in this tissue. This was confirmed by RT-PCR experiments, which showed significant expression of mouse B0AT1 only in kidney and small intestine (Fig. 4). The RT-PCR experiments were confirmed by analysis of the EST data base. Of 62 deposited EST corresponding to XM_127449, 19 are found in the kidney, and 14 are found in the small intestine. Further EST (numbers in parentheses) were detected in skin (9), thymus (7), spleen (5), uterus (4), hematopoietic stem cells (1), diencephalon (1), inner ear (1), and blood vessels (1). To localize the transcriptional activity of mB0AT1 in mouse organs we performed radioactive in situ hybridization assays on paraffin-embedded tissue sections. As depicted in Fig. 5 and 6, hybridization with the 35S-labeled mB0AT1-specific antisense RNA probe revealed significant expression of B0AT1 mRNA only in small intestine (Fig. 5, panel A) and kidney (Fig. 5, panel C) of all investigated mouse tissues. Specific autoradiographic signals were not observed in other organs, such as lung (Fig. 5, panel E), skeletal muscle (Fig. 5, panel F), brain (Fig. 5, cerebellum shown in panel G), liver (Fig. 5, panel H), and pancreas (Fig. 5, panel I). No autoradiographic signals were detected in tissue specimens of all organs when hybridized with the 35S-labeled sense mB0AT1 control probe (Fig. 5 panel B (small intestine) and panel D (kidney)). In kidney, mB0AT1 transcripts were localized in the renal cortex but not in the medulla as exemplarily shown in Fig. 5, panel C. Analysis of hybridization positive cells at higher resolution (Fig. 6) revealed substantial amounts of mB0AT1 mRNA in the proximal tubules (Fig. 6A). The distal nephron segments and the glomeruli were consistently hybridization negative. In the small intestine, mB0AT1 transcripts were found to be exclusively localized in villus enterocytes. As shown in Fig. 6B, high resolution of the hybridization-positive villi reveals a gradient of mB0AT1 transcription with the highest levels of expression in apical cells. The mB0AT1 mRNA was not detected in crypt cells or in any other cell types of the small intestine (Fig. 5A and 6B).Fig. 6In situ hybridization of mB0AT1 in kidney and intestine at higher resolution. Probes corresponding to the sense and antisense strand of mB0AT1 cDNA were generated by in vitro transcription. The antisense probe was hybridized to mRNA in sections from kidney (panel A) and small intestine (panel B). Panel A shows strong expression in segments of the proximal tubule. In panel B a notable increase of expression is observed toward the tip of the villus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Functional Properties of Mouse B0AT1—Expression of mB0AT1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes resulted in a significant increase of leucine uptake activity compared with control oocytes. On day 5 of expression, for example, mB0AT1-expressing oocytes took up 100 μm [14C]leucine at a rate of 56 ± 10 pmol/15 min. This was more than five times higher than the activity of non-injected oocytes, which amounted to 10 ± 1 pmol/15 min. Uptake of [14C]leucine was Na+-dependent; replacement of NaCl by NMDG-Cl or LiCl completely abolished the transport activity (Fig. 7A). In contrast to other members of the SLC6 family, leucine uptake via mB0AT1 was not significantly affected by replacement of chloride with gluconate (Fig. 7A). Transport of amino acids via mB0AT1 was driven by the membrane potential. The addition of 50 mm KCl to the transport buffer, a manipulation that reduces the membrane potential of oocytes from -40 ± 7 to -16 ± 3 mV, reduced leucine uptake by 52% (Fig. 7B); the addition of 50 mm NH4Cl reduced transport activity further (68%), consistent with its stronger depolarizing effect (-8 ± 3 mV) as compared with 50 mm KCl (Fig. 7B). Reduction of the transport activity was not caused by the increased osmolarity in these solutions, as evidenced by unaltered transport activity observed when 50 mm NMDG-Cl or 100 mm sucrose was added to the ND96 buffer, which contains 96 mm NaCl (Fig. 7B). Transport of leucine via mB0AT1 was pH-dependent, strongly increasing with alkaline pH (Fig. 7C). The data from Fig. 7, A and B, suggest that mB0AT1 is an electrogenic Na+-dependent transporter but, in contrast to other members of the neurotransmitter transporter family, does not appear to be chloride-dependent. This suggests that at least 1 Na+ is co-transported together with neutral amino acids. An activation analysis of leucine transport as a function of the Na+ concentration showed a sigmoidal dependence. Half-maximal transport velocity was reached at a Na+ concentration of 54 ± 4 mm (Fig. 8A). L"

Blood-borne neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, and platelets exhibit heparanase activity that is thought to be stored in specific granules. The degranulated heparanase is implicated in extravasation of metastatic tumor cells and activated cells of the immune system. Degranulation and heparanase release in response to an inflammatory stimulus or platelet activation would facilitate cellular extravasation directly, by altering the composition and structural integrity of the extracellular matrix, or indirectly, by releasing HS-bound proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. We hypothesized that in addition to such indirect effect, the released heparanase may also locally affect and activate neighboring cells such as endothelial cells. Here, we provide evidence that addition of the 65-kDa latent heparanase to endothelial cells enhances Akt signaling. Heparanase-mediated Akt phosphorylation was independent of its enzymatic activity or the presence of cell membrane HS proteoglycans and was augmented by heparin. Moreover, addition of heparanase stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent endothelial cell migration and invasion. These results suggest, for the first time, that heparanase activates endothelial cells and elicits angiogenic responses directly. This effect appears to be mediated by as yet unidentified heparanase receptor. Heparanase is a mammalian endoglycosidase that degrades heparan sulfate (HS) at specific intra-chain sites.

Participating in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and remodeling, heparanase activity has been traditionally correlated with the metastatic potential of tumor-derived cells (4Nakajima M.

Among the few cell types that express heparanase under normal physiological conditions, platelets possess a high heparanase activity and were used as a source for heparanase purification (2Freeman C.

Physiol. 1998; 175: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Heparanase was localized to tertiary granules of neutrophils (12Matzner Y. Bar-Ner M. Yahalom J. Ishai-Michaeli R. Fuks Z.

Cleavage of HS side chains by degranulated heparanase during inflammation may facilitate the passage of blood-borne normal and malignant cells into tissues by altering the composition and structural integrity of the subendothelial ECM (1Vlodavsky I.

In addition, heparanase may facilitate the release of a multitude of HS-bound growth factors, cytokines and chemokines that would, in turn, amplify the immune reaction or activate the vascular endothelium (16Vaday G.G.

We hypothesized that in addition to this indirect effect mediated by HS-bound growth factors, degranulated heparanase may also activate endothelial cells directly. To study this hypothesis, human (HUVEC) and bovine (BAEC) endothelial cells (EC) were incubated with the latent 65-kDa heparanase protein. As noted for primary fibro-blasts (18Nadav L. Eldor A. Yacoby-Zeevi O. Zamir E. Pecker I. Ilan N. Geiger B. Vlodavsky I. Katz B.Z. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 115: 2179-2187Google Scholar) and tumor-derived cells (19Zetser A. Bashenko Y. Miao H.-Q. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7733-7741PubMed Google Scholar), the exogenously added heparanase rapidly interacts with EC, followed by internalization and processing into the 50-kDa active form. Interestingly, heparanase uptake by EC was accompanied by Akt phosphorylation that preceded heparanase processing and exhibited time and dose dependence. Heparanase-mediated Akt phosphorylation was independent of its enzymatic activity and the presence of membrane HS proteoglycans (HSPG) and was augmented by heparin. Moreover, addition of heparanase stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent endothelial cell migration and invasion. These results suggest, for the first time, that heparanase activates EC and elicits angiogenic responses directly. This effect appears to be mediated by as yet unidentified heparanase receptor. Cells and Cell Culture—HUVEC were kindly provided by Dr. Neomi Lanir (Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel) and were cultured in gelatin-coated dishes, as described previously (20Ilan N. Mahooti S. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3621-3631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adult BAEC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor and antibiotics, as described previously (21Elkin M. Miao H.-Q.

Mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (pgsA-745) deficient in xylosyltransferase and unable to initiate glycosaminoglycan synthesis, were kindly provided by Dr. J. Esko (University of California, San Diego, CA) and cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. CHO K1 and HT-29 colon carcinoma cells (also known as WiDr) were purchased from the ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, as above. HT-29 cells synthesize perlecan, a secreted proteoglycan, but no other proteoglycans (22Fuki I.V. Iozzo R.V. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25742-25750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and are therefore a useful model for cell surface HS-deficient cells. In vitro tube-like structure formation on Matrigel-coated plates was performed as described (23Ilan N. Mahooti S. Rimm D.R. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3005-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells, stably transfected with the human heparanase cDNA construct in the mammalian pSecTag vector (Invitrogen), were kindly provided by Dr. H-Q. Miao (ImClone Systems Inc., New York). This plasmid vector provides the IgGκ signal peptide to ensure efficient protein secretion, together with Myc and His tags at the C terminus of the enzyme to enable easy detection and purification (19Zetser A. Bashenko Y. Miao H.-Q. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7733-7741PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies and Reagents—The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: anti-Erk 2 (sc-154), anti-phospho-ERK (sc-7383), anti-Akt (sc-5298), and anti-Myc epitope tag (sc-40). Anti-phospho-Akt antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-heparanase antibody (number 1453) was raised against the entire 65-kDa heparanase precursor isolated from the conditioned medium of heparanase-transfected 293 cells. This antibody was affinity-purified on immobilized bacterially expressed 50-kDa heparanase-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (24Zetser A. Levy-Adam F. Kaplan V. Gingis-Velitsky S. Bashenko Y. Schubert S. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Cell Sci. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Laminaran sulfate (LS) was purchased from Qingdao Third Pharmaceutical Company (Qingdao, China) (25Miao H.-Q. Elkin M. Aingorn E. Ishai-Michaeli R. Stein C. Vlodavsky I. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The PI3K inhibitor LY 294002 was purchased from Sigma and was dissolved in Me2SO. Equivalent volume of the vehicle was always included as a control. Heparanase Uptake Studies—For uptake studies, the 65-kDa Myc-tagged heparanase precursor was added to confluent cell cultures at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, under serum-free conditions. At the indicated time points, the medium was aspirated, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and total cell lysates were prepared as described below. Heparanase uptake and processing were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc and anti-heparanase (number 1453) antibodies. Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Protein Blotting—Cell cultures were pretreated with 1 mm orththovanadate for 10 min at 37 °C, washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm orththovanadate, and scraped into lysis buffer containing a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysate samples were subjected to immunoblotting as described previously (19Zetser A. Bashenko Y. Miao H.-Q. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7733-7741PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ilan N. Mahooti S. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3621-3631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Migration Assay—HUVEC were allowed to grow in tissue culture plates until confluence and were then scraped with the wide end of a 1-ml tip (time 0). Plates were washed twice with PBS to remove detached cells and incubated with complete growth medium, and cell migration into the wounded area was followed for 7 days in the presence or absence of exogenously added heparanase (1 μg/ml). Matrigel Invasion Assay—Invasion assay was performed using modified Boyden chambers with Matrigel-coated polycarbonate Nucleopore membrane (Corning Glass), essentially as described previously (19Zetser A. Bashenko Y. Miao H.-Q. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7733-7741PubMed Google Scholar). Migration assay was similarly performed, except that inserts were coated with fibronectin. Heparanase Immobilization and Adhesion Studies—Heparanase (1 μg/ml) was diluted with 50 mm carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and applied onto tissue culture dishes (16 h, 4 °C). Dishes were subsequently washed, and the remaining binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. Control dishes were coated with BSA alone. HUVEC (2 × 105) were plated onto BSA-or heparanase-coated 35-mm dishes (1 h, 37 °C) and, following several washes, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, photographed, and counted. For immunoblot analysis, HUVEC were similarly plated onto heparanase-coated dishes or were left in suspension as control, and cell lysates were prepared as described above. Heparanase Activity Assay—Preparation of ECM-coated dishes and determination of heparanase activity were performed as described in detail elsewhere (12Matzner Y. Bar-Ner M. Yahalom J. Ishai-Michaeli R. Fuks Z. Vlodavsky I. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1306-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 26Vlodavsky I. Bonifacino J. Dasso M. Harford J. Lippincott-Schwartz J.

Briefly, purified heparanase (1 μg) was incubated (4 h, 37 °C, pH 6) with soluble Na235SO4-labeled material extracted from ECM (peak I). The incubation medium was subjected to gel filtration on a Sepharose CL-6B column. Fractions (0.2 ml) were eluted with PBS and their radioactivity counted in a β-scintillation counter. To evaluate the enzymatic activity of immobilized heparanase, soluble ECM-derived sulfate-labeled material (peak I) was applied onto heparanase-coated dishes and following incubation (4 h, 37 °C, pH 6) was subjected to gel filtration, as described above. All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Akt activation is presented as mean ± S.E. of at least five independent experiments quantified by densitometry analysis. Heparanase Is Subjected to Processing at the C Terminus—Under certain physiological conditions vascular EC are likely to be exposed locally to elevated levels of heparanase. To study the effect of heparanase on EC, human (HUVEC) and bovine (BAEC) EC were incubated with exogenously added Myc-tagged latent 65-kDa heparanase precursor, and heparanase uptake was followed by means of immunoblotting. As demonstrated in Fig. 1A, heparanase rapidly interacts with primary EC in culture. Immunoblot analysis with the anti-Myc epitope antibody revealed a strong signal already 15 min (HUVEC, upper panel, left) and 30 min (BAEC, upper panel, right) following heparanase addition. Interestingly, the anti-Myc antibody recognized only a single protein band that corresponded to the added 65-kDa heparanase form, while a lower protein band was not detected even at later time points, when heparanase processing was evident (Fig. 1, second panel, 2h and 4h). Reactivity with the anti-Myc antibody declined rapidly and preceded heparanase processing that became detectable by 60 min and was mainly apparent by 2 h and 4 h (Hepa, second panel). This may suggest that in addition to the processing at Glu109-Ser110 and Gln157-Lys158 that removes the linker domain and ultimately generates the 8-and 50-kDa heparanase subunits (27McKenzie E.

Heparanase Induces Akt Phosphorylation—We have recently reported that heparanase expression in stably transfected U87 glioma cells induced a marked increase in Akt phosphorylation levels that correlated with an enhanced cellular motility (19Zetser A. Bashenko Y. Miao H.-Q. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7733-7741PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of the latent 65-kDa heparanase protein resulted in a similar Akt phosphorylation in EC. Akt activation appeared maximal 30-60 min after heparanase addition and subsequently declined to basal levels (Fig. 1A, third panel). Moreover, heparanase-induced Akt phosphorylation was dose dependent (Fig. 1B), reaching a maximal effect at 1 μg/ml (∼5-fold increase as judged by densitometry analysis) (Fig. 1C). This Akt activation was specific as the phosphorylation of other signaling molecules such as MAPK was not induced or even reduced (Fig. 1A, fifth panel). Similar results were obtained with mouse (EOMA) EC (not shown). HSPG Are Not Required for Heparanase-induced Akt Activation—The rapid and efficient uptake of heparanase by various cell types is thought to be mediated, at least in part, by the cell membrane HSPG (18Nadav L. Eldor A. Yacoby-Zeevi O. Zamir E. Pecker I. Ilan N. Geiger B. Vlodavsky I. Katz B.Z. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 115: 2179-2187Google Scholar). To evaluate the possible involvement of HSPG in Akt activation, heparanase was added to CHO 745 cells that exhibit minimal HS and chondroitin sulfate synthesis (29Esko J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Addition of heparanase to these HS-deficient cells resulted in Akt activation, similar in magnitude and kinetics to that observed in EC (Fig. 2A, left upper panel). This apparent HSPG-independent heparanase function was further confirmed by performing the same experiment with HT-29 cells. This human colon tumor-derived cell line synthesizes perlecan, a secreted HSPG residing mainly in the ECM, but no other species of HSPG (22Fuki I.V. Iozzo R.V. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25742-25750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Addition of heparanase to HT-29 cells resulted in time-dependent Akt activation (Fig. 2A, right upper panel), further supporting the notion that heparanase-induced Akt activation does not involve membranous HS. As was noted for EC (Fig. 1A), Akt activation appeared specific, and MAPK phosphorylation was not affected by heparanase addition (Fig. 2A, third panel). Densitometry analysis revealed a comparable, 4-5-fold increase in Akt phosphorylation upon heparanase addition to EC and to HS-deficient cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, Akt activation was also evident following addition of heparanase to heparitinase-treated EC (data not shown). These findings suggest that cell surface molecules other than HSPG are involved in heparanase-mediated Akt activation. Heparanase-induced Akt Activation Is Independent of Its Enzymatic Activity—In terms of kinetics, maximal Akt activation was observed 30 min following heparanase addition and preceded its processing into the 50-kDa active form that was first detected 60 min after its addition (Fig. 1A), suggesting that Akt activation is independent of heparanase enzymatic activity. To further confirm this notion, CHO 745 cells were incubated with heparanase in the presence or absence of the heparanase inhibitor LS (Fig. 3, left panel). We have previously reported that this chemically sulfated polysaccharide inhibits both heparanase activity and experimental metastasis (25Miao H.-Q. Elkin M. Aingorn E. Ishai-Michaeli R. Stein C. Vlodavsky I. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Addition of heparanase to CHO 745 cells resulted in a 4-fold increase of Akt activation, in agreement with our previous results (Fig. 2A, left panel). Interestingly, addition of heparanase to CHO 745 cells together with LS at 10 μg/ml, a concentration that completely abolished heparanase enzymatic activity (25Miao H.-Q. Elkin M. Aingorn E. Ishai-Michaeli R. Stein C. Vlodavsky I. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), did not prevent Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B). On the contrary, combined addition of heparanase and LS resulted in a further nearly 2-fold induction of Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B). It is well documented that several HS-bound growth factors prototyped by members of the fibroblast growth factor family, require HS or heparin to establish a stable complex with their receptor and exert a maximal biological effect (30Ornitz D.M. BioEssay. 2000; 22: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 31Powers C.J. McLesky S.W. Wellstein A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 32Pellegrini L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Being a sulfated polysaccharide, we questioned whether the augmentation of Akt activation by LS could be reproduced by commercial heparin. To this end, HUVEC (Fig. 3, C and D) cells were left untreated or incubated with heparanase without or with heparin. As shown in Fig. 3C, Akt activation by heparanase was augmented by heparin in a manner and magnitude comparable with LS (Fig. 3, C and D), while heparin alone had no effect (not shown). Similarly, heparanase induced Akt activation in wild type CHO K1 cells (Fig. 3, E and F), albeit to a lower magnitude due to high endogenous Akt phosphorylation levels in these cells (not shown). Nevertheless, the addition of heparin augmented Akt phosphorylation by heparanase nearly 2-fold (Fig. 3, E and F), as was noted for primary endothelial cells (HUVEC, Fig. 3, C and D). These findings support the notion that Akt activation is mediated by a putative heparanase receptor and that heparin may be required for maximal receptor activity. Although the 50-kDa active heparanase enzyme was not detected in our 65-kDa heparanase preparation by means of immunoblotting (not shown), a low heparanase activity was evident applying the highly sensitive sulfate-labeled ECM assay (Fig. 4A). It is therefore possible that Akt activation was induced by this low level of the active 50-kDa heparanase form. To further rule out the necessity of heparanase activity for Akt activation, heparanase was bound to the tissue culture plastic under high pH conditions (carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6). Exposure of active heparanase to pH 9.6 irreversibly inactivated the enzyme (Fig. 4A). In addition, and in contrast to the soluble protein, the immobilized inactive heparanase protein is not available to uptake and processing, providing an experimental system in which inactive heparanase can only function from outside the cell. The immobilized heparanase protein induced an 8-fold increase in EC adhesion compared with control BSA-coated dishes (Fig. 4B), supporting the notion that under certain physiological conditions heparanase may mediate cell adhesion (19Zetser A. Bashenko Y. Miao H.-Q. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7733-7741PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gilat D. Hershkoviz R. Goldkorn I. Cahalon L. Korner G. Vlodavsky I. Lider O. J. Exp.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). HUVEC adhesion to the immobilized inactive heparanase resulted in a marked 10-fold induction of Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 4C, upper panel, and D), again implying that Akt activation is independent of heparanase activity. Interestingly, under these experimental conditions, MAPK was also activated (Fig. 4C, third panel, and E), suggesting that additional adhesion related pathways were engaged. Heparanase Induces Akt-dependent EC Migration—To evaluate the possible effect of exogenously added heparanase on EC behavior, HUVEC were plated on top of Matrigel-coated dishes. Under these conditions, EC rearrange themselves into lumen-containing tube-like structures (23Ilan N. Mahooti S. Rimm D.R. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3005-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a process that resembles several features of angiogenesis. Control cultures exhibited only a limited network formation (Con, Fig. 5A). In contrast, addition of heparanase resulted in a well organized EC structures composed of interconnected, elongated EC (Hepa, Fig. 5A). EC network formation on Matrigel-coated dishes was rapid and completed within 24 h. Thus, EC migration rather than EC proliferation is likely to be involved in this assay. To evaluate the effect of heparanase on EC migration, confluent HUVEC cultures were scraped with the wide end of a 1-ml pipette tip, and cell migration into the wounded area was examined over 7 days in culture, without or with heparanase addition. As shown in Fig. 5B, addition of heparanase stimulated a significant migratory response compared with untreated cultures. Enhanced migration rates in response to heparanase addition were further confirmed and quantified by migration assay on fibronectin-coated inserts. Under these conditions, addition of heparanase resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in HUVEC migration rate (Fig. 5, C and D). Importantly, addition of heparanase together with the PI3K inhibitor LY 294002 abolished the promigratory effect of heparanase (Fig. 5, C and D), while the heparanase inhibitor LS had no effect on EC migration (Fig. 5, C and E), in agreement with our previous finding that heparanase enzymatic activity is not required for Akt activation (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, heparanase stimulated a 5-fold increase in EC invasion through Matrigel-coated inserts, and this effect was similarly prevented by LY 294002 (Fig. 5, F and G). These findings clearly indicate that heparanase directly stimulates EC motility. This effect is PI3K-dependent, is likely mediated by heparanase-induced Akt activation, and may involve a putative heparanase receptor. Heparanase activity has long been attributed to metastatic and immune cells capable of penetrating the ECM barrier (5Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. Elkin M. Aingorn H. Atzmon R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bitan M.

Blood-borne neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, and platelets exhibit heparanase activity that is thought to be stored in specific granules (1Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. J. Clin.

Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The degranulated heparanase was implicated in cellular extravasation (7Bashkin P. Razin E. Eldor A. Vlodavsky I. Blood. 1990; 75: 2204-2212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Vlodavsky I. Eldor A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Matzner Y. Ishai-Michaeli R. Lider O. Naparstek Y. Cohen I.R. Fuks Z. Invasion Metastasis. 1992; 12: 112-127PubMed Google Scholar). Degranulation and heparanase release in response to a proper inflammatory stimulus, or upon platelet activation, may facilitate cellular extravasation directly by altering the composition and insolubility of the ECM or indirectly by releasing HS-bound proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (16Vaday G.G. Lider O. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In addition, the released heparanase may also locally affect and activate neighboring cells such as endothelial cells. Indeed, exogenously added heparanase stimulated Akt phosphorylation in human, bovine, and mouse EC (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4), while other signaling pathways such as the MAPK were not induced (Figs. 1A and 2A). The rapid and efficient cellular binding and uptake of heparanase appear to be mediated by the cell membrane HSPG (18Nadav L. Eldor A. Yacoby-Zeevi O. Zamir E. Pecker I. Ilan N. Geiger B. Vlodavsky I. Katz B.Z. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 115: 2179-2187Google Scholar). Nevertheless, elevated Akt phosphorylation levels, comparable in magnitude and kinetics, were observed in HS-deficient CHO 745 and HT-29 cells (Fig. 2), implying that heparanase can interact with cell surface molecules other than HSPG. The augmentation of Akt phosphorylation levels by heparin (Fig. 3, C and D) may suggest the existence of a specific heparanase receptor that, similar to several growth factor receptors, requires heparin to exert maximal activities (31Powers C.J. McLesky S.W. Wellstein A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 35Zioncheck T.F. Richardson L. Liu J. Chang L. King K.L. Bennett G.L. Fugedi P.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19315-19321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Studies aiming to identify this putative heparanase receptor are currently in progress. Several lines of evidence suggest that Akt activation is independent of heparanase enzymatic activity. In terms of kinetics, elevated Akt phosphorylation levels were evident already 15 min following heparanase addition (Figs. 1A and 2A) and preceded heparanase processing detected 60 min following heparanase application (Fig. 1A). In addition, enhanced Akt phosphorylation in response to heparanase was not prevented by the heparanase inhibitor LS but was rather augmented (Fig. 3, A and B). This finding is in agreement with the contribution of heparin to Akt activation by heparanase (Fig. 3, C and D), arguing, perhaps, for a general stimulation mediated by sulfated polysaccharides. Exposure of heparanase to pH 9.6 resulted in inactivation of the enzyme. Immobilizing heparanase under high pH conditions (pH 9.6) not only ensures complete inactivation of heparanase enzymatic activity (Fig. 4A) but also prevents heparanase uptake, thus forcing response mediated by cell membrane proteins. The immobilized heparanase markedly facilitated HUVEC adhesion (Fig. 4B). This phenomenon is in agreement with our recent findings that heparanase-mediated Eb lymphoma (28Fairbanks M.B. Mildner A.M.

Importantly, HUVEC adhering to the immobilized heparanase responded by a marked elevation of Akt phosphorylation levels (Fig. 4, C and D), strongly arguing for Akt activation independent of heparanase enzymatic activity. Interestingly, the MAPK pathway was also activated (Fig. 4, D and E), suggesting that under these experimental conditions, other signaling pathways were engaged. Integrins, possibly co-operating with syndecan family members such as syndecan-4 (37Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Robinson S.D. Hynes R.O. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl.

In agreement with these reports, Akt phosphorylation by heparanase correlated with enhanced PI3K-dependent EC migration (Fig. 5, B-D) and invasion (Fig. 5, F and G).

YML059c, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein with sequence homology to NTE, had similar catalytic properties to the mammalian enzyme in assays of microsome preparations and, like NTE, was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Yeast lacking YML059c were viable under all conditions examined but, unlike the wild-type strain, did not convert PtdCho to GroPCho. Despite the absence of the deacylation pathway, the net rate of [14C]choline incorporation into PtdCho in YML059c-null yeast was not greater than that in the wild type; this was because, in the null strain diminished net uptake of extracellular choline and decreased formation of the rate-limiting intermediate, CDP-choline, resulted in a reduced rate of PtdCho synthesis. In [14C]choline labeling experiments with cultured mammalian cell lines, production of [14C]GroPCho was enhanced by overexpression of catalytically active NTE and was diminished by reduction of endogenous NTE activity mediated either by RNA interference or organophosphate treatment.

In both yeast (1Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3756-3763Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (2Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9400-9408Google Scholar), PtdCho synthesized by the CDP-choline pathway (see Fig. 1) is deacylated by as yet unidentified phospholipases to form glycerophosphocholine (GroPCho). In principle, this deacylation at both sn-2 and sn-1 positions of PtdCho could be mediated either by a single enzyme with phospholipase B activity or by sequential action of a phospholipase A2 and a lysophospholipase. We have reported that when mixed micelles of PtdCho with detergent were incubated with the recombinant catalytic domain of neuropathy target esterase (NTE), fatty acid was liberated very slowly from the sn-2 position followed by rapid deacylation of the resulting lysophospholipid (3van Tienhoven M. Atkins J. Li Y. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20942-20948Google Scholar). Because the rates and selectivities of bond cleavage observed in phospholipase assays in vitro are profoundly affected by the physicochemical nature of the substrate (4Reynolds L.J. Washburn W.N. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 3-23Google Scholar, 5Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Google Scholar, 6Lin Q. Higgs H.N. Glomsett J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9335-9344Google Scholar), it is possible that in vivo NTE could deacylate the sn-2 position of PtdCho more efficiently than observed in our experiments. Thus, NTE might be the phospholipase B responsible for converting PtdCho to GroPCho (see Fig. 1). NTE was originally identified as the target site for those organophosphates that cause a paralyzing delayed neuropathy with degeneration of long nerve axons (7Johnson M.K. Biochem. J. 1969; 114: 711-714Google Scholar). In adult animals NTE is present in the nervous system and a variety of non-neural tissues (8Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 625-631Google Scholar). NTE is also widely expressed during fetal development (9Moser M. Stempfl T. Li Y. Glynn P. Buettner R. Kretzschmar D. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 279-282Google Scholar). Studies on green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged NTE constructs expressed in COS cells indicate that NTE is anchored to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (10Li Y. Dinsdale D. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8820-8825Google Scholar). Definitive evidence that NTE can convert PtdCho to GroPCho could be obtained by comparing PtdCho metabolism in wild-type and NTE-null cells. However, mice lacking NTE die by mid-gestation (11Winrow C.J. Hemming M.L. Allen D.M. Quistad G.B. Casida J.E. Barlow C. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 477-485Google Scholar, 12Moser M. Li Y. Vaupel K. Kretzschmar D. Kluge R. Glynn P. Buettner R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1667-1679Google Scholar), and fibroblasts from day 8 embryos can be cultured for only limited periods (12Moser M. Li Y. Vaupel K. Kretzschmar D. Kluge R. Glynn P. Buettner R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1667-1679Google Scholar). On the other hand, a gene, YML059c, in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, encodes a putative protein with substantial sequence homology to NTE. The availability of a YML059c-null mutant strain from the Euroscarf collection suggested that this protein is not essential for yeast viability under all growth conditions. The aim of the present study was to determine whether YML059c has the same catalytic properties and subcellular location as NTE, whether YML059c-null mutant yeast can be used to investigate a role for this protein in PtdCho deacylation, and finally, whether NTE mediates the same biochemical reaction in cultured mammalian cells. Materials—[Methyl-14C]Choline chloride (56 mCi/mmol) and l-[methyl-14C]methionine (59 mCi/mmol), cytidene 5′-diphospho[methyl-14C]choline (56 mCi/mmol), and phosphoryl[methyl-14C]choline (55 mCi/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. Lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPtdCho; from egg yolk containing primarily palmitic and stearic acids; catalogue number L4129), choline, and methionine were purchased from Sigma. Double-stranded siRNA (with and without a 3′-fluorescein label) was synthesized by Xeragon, and the sequences used were 5′-AAGAUUAUGCGGAAGGUGUCAdTT-3′ for NTE-siRNA and 5′-CAGGAGUUAGGCGUAGUCGAAdTT-3′ as a control siRNA. The sources for all other reagents have been described previously (3van Tienhoven M. Atkins J. Li Y. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20942-20948Google Scholar, 10Li Y. Dinsdale D. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8820-8825Google Scholar). Generation of Yeast Strains—The basic yeast strains used in this study (Table I) were obtained from Euroscarf and were maintained on standard YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose). Unless stated otherwise, yeast strains were grown at 30 °C. The Euroscarf Yml059cΔ deletion strains carry an allele wherein the complete YML059c open reading frame has been replaced by PCR-mediated insertion of the G418-resistance module Kan MX4 (13Wach A.

A cassette containing the GAL1 promoter plus GFP tag and HIS3MX6 marker was amplified by PCR from a pFA6a-HIS3MX6-Pgal1-GFP plasmid (15Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Google Scholar); the PCR primers were designed so that the flanking sequence of the cassette would allow insertion by homologous recombination of the selectable marker, the GAL1 promoter, and the GFP tag upstream of YML059c. One of the resultant heterozygous diploid transformants was induced to undergo meiosis and sporulation to give the haploid progeny BY4741 Pgal1-GFP-YML059c and BY4742 Pgal1-GFP-YML059c, which were subsequently crossed to form the homozygous diploid BY4743 Pgal-GFP-YML059c/Pgal-GFP-YML059c (hereafter called GFP-YML059c +/+). To allow overexpression of a plasmid-based construct (rather than a chromosomal one, as above), genomic DNA from BY4743 Pgal-GFP-YML059c was amplified by PCR, and the resulting product was ligated into the SacI and XhoI sites of the URA3 centromeric yeast cloning vector pRS416. The codon for the putative active site serine (Ser-1406) in the plasmid pRS416-Pgal-GFP-YML059c was mutated to code for alanine by making a single T to G transversion of base 4216 using the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit. Yeast (BY4743 strains) were transformed to uracil prototrophy with these plasmids by heat shocking in 0.1 m lithium acetate (16Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Google Scholar). Phenotypic Tests—A series of standard tests (17Hampsey M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1099-1133Google Scholar) was carried out to compare the haploid wild-type BY4741 and BY4741 yml059cΔ mutant response to a wide variety of nutrients, stress conditions, and inhibitors. Most of these involved spotting serial dilutions of the wild-type or mutant yeast onto YP (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone medium) agar plates with a variety of carbon sources (glucose, galactose, sucrose, maltose, glycerol, acetate, and a 2-deoxglucose/sucrose mixture) or on YPD agar with various concentrations of stressor/inhibitor agents (H2O2, sorbitol, acid, ethanol, calcofluor, caffeine, EDTA, phenanthroline, formamide, cycloheximide, sodium orthovanadate, and heavy metal ions). Growth on YPD-agar was assessed at various temperatures from 4 to 37 °C and at 30 °C after 55 °C heat shock (30–90 min). Growth was also assessed under anaerobic conditions on YPD-agar containing Tween 80 and ergosterol and under aerobic conditions on yeast nitrogen base agar with either ammonium sulfate or proline as the nitrogen source. Growth of Yeast for Overexpression of YML059c and Isolation of Microsomes—Overnight cultures of yeast strains in YP medium containing 2% galactose were diluted to a standard concentration (A600 ∼ 0.2) and then grown in YP, 2% galactose until A600 ∼ 1.0 (5–6 h). Yeast were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then stored at –20 °C. Frozen yeast cell pellets (equivalent to 30-ml culture with A600 ∼ 1.0) were thawed, resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and then vortexed (5 min; 4 °C) with 0.5 g of glass beads (425–600 μm diameter; Sigma). The resulting homogenate was made up to a volume of 1 ml with TE buffer, then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The pellet fraction was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold TE buffer by using a syringe with a 25-gauge needle, and then spun in an Eppendorf centrifuge (1 min; 300 × g). The resulting supernatant fraction was carefully recovered and used as a yeast microsomal preparation. Localization of GFP-YML059c by Confocal and Immunoelectron Microscopy—Yeast overexpressing GFP-YML059c were grown as described above, harvested, and washed twice with PBS. For confocal microscopy, unfixed yeast were immobilized in agarose and examined using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a 488-nm argon laser. Confocal micrographs were deconvolved using the Huygens 2 software system, and volume rendering of confocal image stacks was done using Improvision Velocity 2.5 software. Other samples were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and then treated with zymolyase (18Bauer C. Herzog V. Bauer M.F. Microsc. Microanal. 2001; 7: 530-534Google Scholar) before being prepared for routine electron microscopy. Yeast for immunoelectron microscopy were fixed with a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde and embedded in LR-White resin (19Dinsdale D. Green J.A. Manson M.M. Lee M.J. Histochem. J. 1992; 24: 144-152Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were incubated with a mixture of monoclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptides of GFP (#8367, BD Biosciences) and secondary antibodies conjugated with 10-nm colloidal gold (British Biocell International Ltd). Isolation of Microsomes from COS Cells Overexpressing NTE-GFP— Methods for cloning full-length human NTE into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) to create a construct with a carboxyl-terminal GFP tag, for the generation of a catalytically inactive NTE-GFP construct with serine 966 mutated to alanine, for transient overexpression of these constructs in COS and HeLa cells, and for isolating microsomes from these cells have been detailed previously (10Li Y. Dinsdale D. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8820-8825Google Scholar). Esterase and Lysophospholipase Assays on Microsomes—Esterase activity in microsome preparations was determined using phenyl valerate as substrate as described (20Atkins J. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24477-24483Google Scholar). The procedure for assaying lysophospholipase activity has been detailed previously (3van Tienhoven M. Atkins J. Li Y. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20942-20948Google Scholar). In brief, microsomes (0.05–0.1 mg of protein) were incubated (37 °C) with various concentrations of LysoPtdCho in 0.5 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, containing 2.4 mm CHAPS. Reactions were stopped at either zero time or after 3 min by the addition of 10 μl of 1 mm methylarachidonylfluorophosphonate, and fatty acids liberated were subsequently determined using a kit assay (Roche Diagnostics). PtdCho Metabolism in Yeast—Our initial experiments followed the protocols described by Dowd et al. (1Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3756-3763Google Scholar). To investigate the turnover of phosphatidylcholine, wild-type and YML059cΔ/Δ yeast were grown for 18 h at 25 °C in SD medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base with 2% glucose and histidine (0.02 mg/ml), leucine (0.03 mg/ml), and uracil (0.02 mg/ml)) containing 0.1 mm choline or 0.1 mm methionine supplemented with 1 μCi/ml [14C]choline or [methyl-14C]methionine. Yeast were then pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with water, resuspended to a density of A600 of 0.8 in SD medium containing either 10 mm choline or 10 mm methionine, and then grown for 4 h at 25 °C. Subsequently, yeast were grown at 37 °C, and aliquots (1.0 ml) were removed at various times and pelleted by centrifugation (Eppendorf centrifuge; 16,000 × g; 5 min). An aliquot (0.5 ml) of the supernatant, representing extracellular medium, was saved, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid and recentrifuged. An aliquot (0.25 ml) of the supernatant (representing the water-soluble intracellular fraction) was saved, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 1.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and recentrifuged. An aliquot (0.25 ml) of the supernatant was combined with the previously saved aliquot of the trichloroacetic acid supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in 1.0 ml of 1% SDS in TE buffer, and 0.5 ml (representing the membrane fraction) was saved. Total 14C radioactivities in the three 0.5-ml aliquots representing extracellular, soluble intracellular, and membrane fractions (see Ref. 1Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3756-3763Google Scholar) were determined by scintillation counting. Aliquots (0.5 ml) of the resuspended membrane fraction were extracted with 1.0 ml chloroform-methanol-acetic acid (2:1:0.02), and distribution of radioactivity between the aqueous and organic phases was determined. TLC fractionation in chloroform, methanol, acetic acid, 0.9%NaCl (100:50:16:5) followed by phosphorimaging was used to show that essentially all the radioactivity in the organic phase comigrated with PtdCho. To examine PtdCho synthesis via the CDP-choline pathway, yeast were grown for 18 h at 25 °C in SD medium with 0.1 mm choline, then pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended to a density of A600 of 0.3–0.4 in fresh SD medium containing 0.1 mm choline supplemented with 1 μCi/ml [14C]choline, and grown at 37 °C. Aliquots (1.0 ml) were removed at various times and pelleted in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold water and then frozen. After thawing, yeast were vortexed for 5 min at 4 °C in chloroform-methanol (1:1) with glass beads, and then water and chloroform were added to allow phase separation as described by Williams and McMaster (21Williams J.G. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13482-13487Google Scholar). Radioactivity in aliquots of the aqueous and organic solvent phases was determined by scintillation counting. The remainder of the aqueous phase was dried in a Speed-Vac, then dissolved in water and fractionated by TLC in methanol, 0.6% NaCl, aqueous ammonia (1:1:0.1) (21Williams J.G. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13482-13487Google Scholar). The distribution of 14C-labeled metabolites on the TLC plate was determined by phosphorimaging. [14C]Choline Labeling, Whole Cell NTE-Esterase Assays, and siRNA Experiments in Mammalian Cells—COS-7 and HeLa cells were plated (0.2 × 106/35-mm dish) in 1.0 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum and after 24 h were transfected with 1 μgof plasmid and 10 μl of Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. For RNA interference experiments, varying amounts of siRNA (see “Materials” under “Experimental Procedures”) were co-transfected with pEGFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech) and Polyfect. Forty-eight hours after transfection, [14C]choline (1 μCi/ml) was added to each dish, and incubation was continued for various periods up to a further 24 h. Medium was then aspirated, and cells were rinsed twice with PBS and then harvested by scraping in ice-cold 0.5 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 and transferred to an Eppendorf tube. One ml of chloroform-methanol-acetic acid (2:1:0.02) was then added, and after vortexing and centrifugation, aliquots of the aqueous and organic solvent phases were analyzed by scintillation counting, TLC, and phosphorimaging as for the yeast samples. In some experiments, organophosphorus esters (OP) were added to non-transfected cells at the same time as [14C]choline. In experiments to determine the effect of RNA interference or OPs on NTE-esterase activity cells were not labeled with [14C]choline, but medium was aspirated, cells were rinsed twice with PBS, and then 1.0 ml of TE buffer containing 40 μm paraoxon with or without 50 μm mipafox (22Johnson M.K. Arch. Toxicol. 1977; 37: 113-115Google Scholar) was added to replicate dishes of cells that were then incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. Subsequently, 1.0 ml of phenyl valerate substrate was added for a further 20 min at 37 °C before the reaction was stopped, and phenol liberated was determined spectrophotometrically (22Johnson M.K. Arch. Toxicol. 1977; 37: 113-115Google Scholar). To estimate the efficiency of siRNA transfection, cells were incubated for 24 h with 10 μl of Polyfect and 1 μg of 3′-fluorescein-labeled siRNA (NTE or control sequence), then medium was aspirated, and cells were rinsed twice with PBS and examined by fluorescence microscopy; about 75% of the cells contained detectable amounts of 3′-fluorescein-labeled siRNA (see the supplemental figure, Fluo-siRNA). YML059c, a Putative NTE Homologue, Is Not Essential for Yeast Viability under a Variety of Conditions—A battery of standard tests were performed to determine whether yeast lacking YML059c display a phenotype (see “Experimental Procedures”). However, no significant difference in growth between the wild-type and deletion mutant was detected under any of these conditions. Similarly, other laboratories have attempted global phenotypic analysis by examining large numbers of S. cerevisiae deletion mutants, some of which included YML059c, but none have uncovered a phenotype for yeast lacking this gene (14Giaever G. Chu A.M. Ni L. Connelly C. Riles L. Veronneau S. Dow S. Lucau-Danila A. Anderson K. Andre B. et al.Nature. 2002; 418: 387-391Google Scholar, 23Ross-Macdonald P. Coelho P.S. Roemer T. Agarwal S. Kumar A. Jansen R. Cheung K.H. Sheehan A. Symoniatis D. Umansky L. Heidtman M. Nelson F.K. Iwasaki H. Hager K. Gerstein M. Miller P. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Nature. 1999; 402: 413-418Google Scholar). YML059c Has OP-sensitive Serine Esterase Activity and Can Deacylate Exogenous Lysophospholipid—Sequence similarity between YML059c and NTE (39% identity in the catalytic domain; see Fig. 2a and alignments in Ref. 20Atkins J. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24477-24483Google Scholar) strongly suggest that the yeast protein may have serine esterase activity. However, using phenyl valerate as a substrate, we were unable to detect a significant difference between the low levels of esterase activity in microsomes from wild-type or YML059c-null mutant yeast (Table II). A recent study determined levels of expression of >4000 open reading frames of S. cerevisiae by tagging with GFP and quantitative Western blotting; this revealed that YML059c is present at a level of only ∼500 copies per cell (24Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W-K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Google Scholar). To permit detection of this protein's putative esterase activity we overexpressed various GFP-tagged constructs (see “Experimental Procedures”). Microsomes from yeast overexpressing a chromosomal construct of GFP-YML059c displayed substantially greater esterase activity than the wild-type parent, and the diploid overexpressing strain had twice the activity of the haploid (Table II). Similarly, overexpression of YML059c from a plasmid also led to increased esterase activity, but this increase was abolished in a strain expressing an analogous construct in which the putative active site serine, Ser-1406, was mutated to alanine (Table II).Table IIEsterase activities in microsomes from different yeast strainsStrain (in BY4743)Esterase activityaEsterase activity in nmol of phenyl valerate hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein.

Open table in a new tab NTE was originally identified in brain homogenates as an esterase activity inhibited by neuropathic OP compounds (7Johnson M.K. Biochem. J. 1969; 114: 711-714Google Scholar). Esterase activity in microsomes from COS cells overexpressing NTE-GFP and from yeast overexpressing GFP-YML059c was inhibited by a series of OPs, with both enzymes showing the same rank order of sensitivity: phenyl saligenin phosphate ≫ PDPP ∼ diisopropyl fluorophosphate ≫ paraoxon (Fig. 2, b and c). The potency of OPs toward YML059c in yeast microsomes was 5–10-fold less than against NTE in COS cell microsomes. Preincubation of OPs with yeast microsomal preparations did not reduce their potency to subsequently inhibit the esterase activity of the purified recombinant catalytic domain of NTE (data not shown); this indicates that OPs are not degraded by enzymes in the yeast preparation but, rather, that YML059c is intrinsically less sensitive than NTE to OP inhibition. The purified recombinant catalytic domain of NTE has potent lysophospholipase activity (3van Tienhoven M. Atkins J. Li Y. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20942-20948Google Scholar). Microsomes from COS cells overexpressing NTE-GFP or yeast overexpressing GFP-YML059c showed substantially increased lysophospholipase activity against exogenous LysoPtdCho compared with control microsomes (Fig. 2d). Determination of activity at varying substrate concentrations indicated that both NTE and YML059c were half-maximally active at LysoPtdCho concentrations around 0.05 mm, comparable with the Km value determined previously for the purified recombinant catalytic domain of NTE (3van Tienhoven M. Atkins J. Li Y. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20942-20948Google Scholar). YML059c Localizes to Yeast Endoplasmic Reticulum—Confocal microscopy of yeast overexpressing GFP-tagged YML059c from the chromosomal construct or plasmids showed that fluorescence was confined to the cytoplasm, where it exhibited a reticular distribution with particular focal concentrations (Fig. 3a). Electron microscopy showed that the cytoplasm of most cells contained tubuloreticular complexes that were in continuity with the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3, b and c). Huh et al. (25Huh W.-K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Google Scholar) have recently localized >4000 GFP-tagged yeast proteins expressed at their endogenous levels and concluded that YML059c is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. We have confirmed this localization by immunoelectron microscopy, which revealed that GFP-tagged YML059c was associated with the cytoplasmic complexes (Fig. 3d); these resembled, but were less pronounced and had many more associated mitochondria than complexes observed in mammalian cells overexpressing GFP-tagged NTE (10Li Y. Dinsdale D. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8820-8825Google Scholar). Importantly, we did not detect immunogold labeling in mitochondria despite their close association with the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3d) or in the Golgi apparatus. YML059c Deacylates CDP-choline-derived Phosphatidylcholine—Dowd et al. (1Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3756-3763Google Scholar) report that PtdCho synthesized by the CDP-choline pathway is rapidly deacylated by an unidentified phospholipase in wild-type S. cerevisiae grown at 37 °C. To determine whether YML059c mediates this deacylation, we labeled PtdCho in wild-type and YML059c-null strains by growing them at 25 °C in the presence of [14C]choline and then chased out the label by growing at 37 °C in the presence of excess unlabeled choline. We performed this experiment and analyzed the data essentially as described by Dowd et al. (1Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3756-3763Google Scholar). Under these conditions, [14C]PtdCho was degraded by about 50% within 1 h in wild-type yeast but was much more stable in the YML059c-null strain (Fig. 4a). By contrast, PtdCho labeled by growing yeast in [methyl-14C]methionine (via methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine) was relatively stable in both wild-type and null strains during a subsequent 4-h chase at 37 °Cin the presence of excess unlabeled methionine (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, the degradation of [14C]Cho-labeled PtdCho could be"
https://openalex.org/W2020425240,"Hepatic stellate cells are the major source of the extracellular matrix that accumulates in fibrotic liver. During progressive liver fibrosis, hepatic stellate cells proliferate, but during resolution of fibrosis there is extensive stellate cell apoptosis that coincides with degradation of the liver scar. We have examined the possibility that the fate of stellate cells is influenced by the extracellular matrix through the intermediary of αvβ3 integrin. αvβ3 integrin was expressed by activated, myofibroblastic rat and human stellate cells in culture. Antagonism of this integrin using neutralizing antibodies, echistatin, or small inhibitory RNA to silence αv subunit expression inhibited stellate cell proliferation and their expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and activated forms of p44 and p42 MAPK. These αvβ3 antagonists also increased apoptosis of cultured stellate cells, and this was associated with an increase in the BAX/BCL-2 protein ratio, induction of nuclear DNA fragmentation, and activation of intracellular caspase-3. Expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 by activated stellate cells was reduced by the αvβ3 antagonists, while matrix metalloproteinase-9 synthesis was enhanced. Stellate cells incubated with active recombinant matrix metalloproteinase-9 showed enhanced apoptosis, while cells treated with a synthetic inhibitor of this protease showed increased survival. Our studies suggest that αvβ3 integrin regulates the fate of hepatic stellate cells. Degradation of αvβ3 ligands surrounding activated stellate cells during resolution of liver fibrosis might decrease αvβ3 integrin ligation, suppressing stellate cell proliferation and inducing a fibrolytic, matrix metalloproteinase-secreting phenotype that may prime stellate cells for apoptosis. Hepatic stellate cells are the major source of the extracellular matrix that accumulates in fibrotic liver. During progressive liver fibrosis, hepatic stellate cells proliferate, but during resolution of fibrosis there is extensive stellate cell apoptosis that coincides with degradation of the liver scar. We have examined the possibility that the fate of stellate cells is influenced by the extracellular matrix through the intermediary of αvβ3 integrin. αvβ3 integrin was expressed by activated, myofibroblastic rat and human stellate cells in culture. Antagonism of this integrin using neutralizing antibodies, echistatin, or small inhibitory RNA to silence αv subunit expression inhibited stellate cell proliferation and their expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and activated forms of p44 and p42 MAPK. These αvβ3 antagonists also increased apoptosis of cultured stellate cells, and this was associated with an increase in the BAX/BCL-2 protein ratio, induction of nuclear DNA fragmentation, and activation of intracellular caspase-3. Expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 by activated stellate cells was reduced by the αvβ3 antagonists, while matrix metalloproteinase-9 synthesis was enhanced. Stellate cells incubated with active recombinant matrix metalloproteinase-9 showed enhanced apoptosis, while cells treated with a synthetic inhibitor of this protease showed increased survival. Our studies suggest that αvβ3 integrin regulates the fate of hepatic stellate cells. Degradation of αvβ3 ligands surrounding activated stellate cells during resolution of liver fibrosis might decrease αvβ3 integrin ligation, suppressing stellate cell proliferation and inducing a fibrolytic, matrix metalloproteinase-secreting phenotype that may prime stellate cells for apoptosis. IntroductionPerisinusoidal hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) 1The abbreviations used are: HSC, hepatic stellate cell; ECM, extracellular matrix; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; DMEM, Dulbecco's minimal Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; siRNA, small inhibitory RNA; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Ct, cycle threshold; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; F-actin, fibrillar actin; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; BAX, BCL-2-associated x protein; BCL-2, B-cell lymphoma 2; p125FAK, phosphorylated 125-kDa FAK. play an essential role in the development of liver fibrosis. In the normal liver, HSCs have a low proliferative rate and produce trace amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM), but following chronic liver injury HSCs undergo profound alterations in morphology and synthetic capabilities, transforming to proliferative myofibroblastic cells expressing a wide range of collagenous and non-collagenous ECM molecules as well as the characteristic marker α-smooth muscle actin (1Burt A.D. J. Pathol. 1993; 170: 105-114Google Scholar, 2Ramm G.A. Britton R.S. O'Neill R. Blaner W.S. Bacon B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G532-G541Google Scholar, 3Benyon R.C. Arthur M.J. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1998; 27: 75-85Google Scholar). These so called activated HSCs are the major source of the ECM that accumulates in fibrotic liver (4Reeves H.L. Friedman S.L. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 808-826Google Scholar, 5Maher J.J. Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. Bissell D.M. Gastroenterology. 1988; 94: 1053-1062Google Scholar, 6Milani S. Herbst H. Schuppan D. Hahn E.G. Stein H. Hepatology. 1989; 10: 84-92Google Scholar). HSC activation in vivo can be accurately mimicked in vitro by culturing HSCs isolated from normal liver for 7–14 days on uncoated tissue culture plastic or type I collagen films in serum-containing media (1Burt A.D. J. Pathol. 1993; 170: 105-114Google Scholar, 7Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. Boyles J. Arenson D.M. Bissell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10756-10762Google Scholar). Activated HSCs maintain the capability of degrading ECM as they express matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, -9, and -14, but they simultaneously express tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and -2, which effectively curb activity of these MMPs in vitro (8Benyon R.C. Arthur M.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 373-384Google Scholar, 9Benyon R.C. Hovell C.J. Da Gaca M. Jones E.H. Iredale J.P. Arthur M.J. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 977-986Google Scholar, 10Knittel T. Mehde M. Grundmann A. Saile B. Scharf J.G. Ramadori G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 113: 443-453Google Scholar). The TIMPs, particularly TIMP-1, are also highly expressed by HSCs in ongoing liver fibrosis and might act to stabilize the ECM against degradation by MMP-2 and -14, which remain expressed at high levels during fibrogenesis (11Takahara T. Furui K. Yata Y. Jin B. Zhang L.P. Nambu S. Sato H. Seiki M. Watanabe A. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1521-1529Google Scholar, 12Takahara T. Furui K. Funaki J. Nakayama Y. Itoh H. Miyabayashi C. Sato H. Seiki M. Ooshima A. Watanabe A. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 787-795Google Scholar, 13Milani S. Herbst H. Schuppan D. Grappone C. Pellegrini G. Pinzani M. Casini A. Calabro A. Ciancio G. Stefanini F. Burroughs A.K. Surrenti C. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 528-537Google Scholar). However, during spontaneous resolution of liver fibrosis in rats, we have shown that TIMP-1 expression in liver declines sharply within the first 7 days of resolution, which correlates with enhanced MMP activity in liver homogenates and active resorption of collagen septa (14Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C. Pickering J. McCullen M. Northrop M. Pawley S. Hovell C. Arthur M.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 538-549Google Scholar). This phase of matrix degradation coincides with apoptosis of the activated HSCs thus removing these key TIMP- and ECM-producing fibrogenic cells (8Benyon R.C. Arthur M.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 373-384Google Scholar, 14Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C. Pickering J. McCullen M. Northrop M. Pawley S. Hovell C. Arthur M.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 538-549Google Scholar, 15Issa R. Williams E. Trim N. Kendall T. Arthur M.J. Reichen J. Benyon R.C. Iredale J.P. Gut. 2001; 48: 548-557Google Scholar, 16Iredale J.P. BMJ. 2003; 327: 143-147Google Scholar). The natural trigger for HSC apoptosis is unknown, but our recent studies show that intact type I collagen within the fibrotic neomatrix acts as an effective survival signal for HSCs in vivo (17Issa R. Zhou X. Trim N. Millward-Sadler H. Krane S. Benyon C. Iredale J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 47-49Google Scholar). Therefore, degradation of ECM proteins during resolution might remove HSC survival signals resulting in their apoptosis. Pericellular ECM is known to exert profound influences on cellular proliferation, synthetic capabilities, and survival (18Volloch V. Kaplan D. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 533-543Google Scholar). The key receptors that mediate these effects are the heterodimeric α/β integrin family, which can act to potentiate signals from soluble growth and survival factors (19Van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Google Scholar, 20Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Google Scholar). There is increasing awareness that many cultured cells require contact with an appropriate ECM to survive, and apoptosis due to loss of appropriate adhesion is referred to as “anoikis” (21Grossmann J. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 247-260Google Scholar, 22Frisch S.M. Screaton R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Google Scholar). As in the case of HSC apoptosis during resolution of liver fibrosis (14Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C. Pickering J. McCullen M. Northrop M. Pawley S. Hovell C. Arthur M.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 538-549Google Scholar), ECM remodeling is associated with apoptosis in vivo (23Lund L.R. Romer J. Thomasset N. Solberg H. Pyke C. Bissell M.J. Dano K. Werb Z. Development. 1996; 122: 181-193Google Scholar, 24Wiesen J. Werb Z. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2000; 56: 534-540Google Scholar). In one of the best studied examples, unscheduled apoptosis of mouse mammary gland epithelial cells with consequent glandular involution was induced during weaning by forced overexpression of MMP-3 in these cells, an effect that was reduced when cells were induced to overexpress TIMP-1 (25Alexander C.M. Howard E.W. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1669-1677Google Scholar). Therefore, in tissues that undergo extensive remodeling as part of a natural physiological response (e.g. development of mammary gland, embryo implantation, and embryogenesis (26Alexander C.M. Hansell E.J. Behrendtsen O. Flannery M.L. Kishnani N.S. Hawkes S.P. Werb Z. Development. 1996; 122: 1723-1736Google Scholar, 27Cai D.H. Brauer P.R. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 441-449Google Scholar)) or as a repair response to pathological insult (e.g. resolution of fibrosis), matrix degradation might act as a common pathway for removing redundant cells by depriving them of integrin ligands essential for their survival.A key question is how apoptosis is triggered by changes in ECM composition. In several cell types, protection from apoptosis is critically dependent on engagement of specific integrins; for example, endothelial cell survival in vitro and in vivo (28Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. Cancer J. 2000; 3: S245-S249Google Scholar) requires ligation of integrin αvβ3, while survival of mammary gland epithelial cells requires β1 integrin ligation (29Faraldo M.M. Deugnier M.A. Thiery J.P. Glukhova M.A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 480: 169-174Google Scholar, 30Streuli C.H. Gilmore A.P. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1999; 4: 183-191Google Scholar). HSC activation and proliferation are profoundly influenced by their culture matrix in vitro (7Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. Boyles J. Arenson D.M. Bissell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10756-10762Google Scholar, 31Gaca M.D. Zhou X. Issa R. Kiriella K. Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 229-239Google Scholar), but the role of specific integrins in regulating these cells has not been investigated. In this study, we have demonstrated that integrin αvβ3 becomes expressed by HSCs during their activation in vitro and promotes their proliferation and survival. We suggest that the accumulation of αvβ3 ligands within the space of Disse during fibrogenesis might contribute to HSC proliferation, whereas degradation of such ligands during resolution of liver fibrosis may contribute to the observed apoptotic depletion of these cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExperimental Models of Progressive Fibrosis and Fibrosis Recovery— Experimental models of reversible fibrosis were established by injecting cohorts of Sprague-Dawley rats with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4, 0.1 ml/100 g of rat body weight, dissolved in an equal volume of olive oil) twice weekly intraperitoneally for 6 weeks. Livers were harvested at peak fibrosis (3 days after the final injection of carbon tetrachloride) and at 8 and 28 days of spontaneous recovery (n = 4 at each time point in each model). Four normal rat livers were also harvested for use as controls. Approximately 30 mg of harvested livers were homogenized using a probe homogenizer in buffer containing 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.15 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin A, 0.1 mm iodoacetamide, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6.Isolation of Human and Rat Hepatic Stellate Cells—Human HSCs were extracted from normal human liver samples removed from margins of liver resected from patients with colonic metastatic disease as described previously (32Iredale J.P. Goddard S. Murphy G. Benyon R.C. Arthur M.J. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1995; 89: 75-81Google Scholar). Local ethics committee approval was obtained for the studies with human liver. Rat HSCs were extracted from normal rat liver using pronase and collagenase as described previously (9Benyon R.C. Hovell C.J. Da Gaca M. Jones E.H. Iredale J.P. Arthur M.J. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 977-986Google Scholar). HSCs were purified to 90–95% purity by density gradient centrifugation and elutriation. Purified HSCs were cultured on plastic for 7–10 days to induce activation to an α-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblastic phenotype. Unless otherwise stated, human and rat HSCs were used for our studies after activation in primary culture for ∼10 days or after first or second passage. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (BioWhittaker) in the presence of 16% fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamycin (Invitrogen).Culture of HSCs on Different Matrix Proteins—The wells of 24-well, 6-well, or 96-well tissue culture plates were coated with fibronectin (50 ng/cm2 in DMEM), vitronectin (50 ng/cm2 in DMEM), and collagen I (50 μg/cm2 in 0.3 m acetic acid) at 4 °C overnight. Growth factor-reduced Matrigel (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) diluted 2:1 by volume in DMEM at 37 °C was applied as a ∼0.5-mm layer and allowed to polymerize overnight. All coated wells were washed three times with Hanks' buffered salt solution. Activated HSCs were removed from plastic using trypsin (2.5 mg/ml) in EDTA (0.58 mm) and replated on the matrix-coated plates at a density of 3 × 106 cells/ml.Treatment with Echistatin, Blocking Antibody, and Vitronectin— Activated HSCs at either primary culture or first passage on plastic at 70–80% confluence were treated with 100 nm echistatin (Sigma) or neutralizing antibodies to integrins αvβ3, β1, and β3 at 20 μg/ml (all from Chemicon).Design and Synthesis of Small Inhibitory RNA (siRNA) to Silence αv Integrin Expression—siRNAs were synthesized using the Silencer™ siRNA construction kit (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK). The sense and antisense RNAs were annealed, digested, and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. The double strands of siRNA for human and rat αv integrin were of sequence 5′-ugaacugcacuucagauauuu-3′ and 3′-uuacuugacgugaagucuaua-5′. The strand sequences of the random siRNA used in control studies were 5′-ucucuauauguguauguauuu-3′ and 3′-uuagagauauacacauacaua-5′.αv Integrin Gene Silencing in HSC Culture—Primary rat or first passage human HSCs were diluted to 106 cells/ml in DMEM + 16% FCS, and 2 ml were seeded into each well of a 6-well culture plate. When cells reached log phase growth at 50–60% confluence, cells were treated with 2, 5, 10, and 20 nm siRNA in RiboJuice™ siRNA transfection reagent (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells cultured in the presence or absence of RiboJuice without siRNA were used as controls, and where stated, random siRNA in the same concentration and condition was also used as a control.Determination of Messenger RNA Using Taqman Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from freshly isolated or activated HSCs treated as described using a Qiagen RNeasy minikit. The total RNA concentration in each sample was measured by absorbance at 260 nm. The first strand cDNA synthesis from 1 μg of RNA was undertaken using random primers and a Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase system (Promega, Southampton, UK). All primers and probes were designed using the Taqman Primer Express program, and real time Taqman PCR quantitation was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK). The primers and probe sequences of rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) used were as follows: sense, 5′-ggcctacatggcctccaa-3′; antisense, 5′-tctctcttgctctcagtatccttgc-3′; probe, 5′-fluor-labeled VIC™-agaaaccctggaccacccagccc-TAMRA-3′ (TAMRA is 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine). The remaining probes for target genes were labeled by 6-carboxyfluorescein at the 5′-end and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine at the 3′-end. These primers and probes were as follows: integrin β3: sense, 5′-ccactgatgccaagacccata-3′; antisense, 5′-tggcagcgcccatcat-3′; probe, 5′-ctgccagccttccgtccacg-3′; integrin αv: sense, 5′-cagtggccttacaaatacaacaaca-3′; antisense, 5′-tgcagttcattggtccatcaa-3′; probe, 5′-ctttgctgtacattctccattacgac-3′; MMP-9: sense, 5′-cgtggcctacgtgacctatga-3′; antisense, 5′-tgcaccgctgaagcaaaag-3′; probe, 5′-ctgcagtgcccttgaactaaggct-3′; TIMP-1: sense, 5′-agcctgtagctgtgccccaa-3′; antisense, 5′-aactcctcgctgcggttctg-3′; probe, 5′-agaggctctccatggctggggtgta-3′. 1 μl of first strand cDNA (reverse transcribed from 10 ng of RNA), 0.3 μm primers, and 0.3 μm probe were used in a 25-μl PCR in 0.2-ml optical reaction tubes (Applied Biosystems). Taqman 2× Universal PCR Master Mix (12.5 μl) was added. The conditions of the cycling were as follows: initial steps were 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by cycles of a denaturing step for 15 s at 95 °C and an annealing extension step at 60 °C for 1 min. Amplification of the housekeeping gene GAPDH was performed simultaneously with target cDNA, and all reactions were undertaken in triplicate. After detection of the threshold cycle for each mRNA in each sample, relative concentrations were calculated and normalized to GAPDH analyzed in parallel using the ΔΔCt technique.Western Blotting—Western blot analysis using homogenates of rat liver tissue and HSC lysate (cells collected from the cell monolayer and culture medium) was performed using a panel of primary antibodies applied at the concentrations shown in Table I. Homogenates of liver were prepared as described above. HSCs were lysed by freeze-thawing three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by addition of 2× SDS sample buffer as described previously (31Gaca M.D. Zhou X. Issa R. Kiriella K. Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 229-239Google Scholar). The extracted proteins were subjected to 8, 10, or 12% SDS-PAGE in reduced or non-reduced conditions as stated. Equal amounts of cell protein or DNA equivalents were applied to each lane of the gel as stated. Protein was measured using the bicinchoninic acid technique (Sigma), and DNA was measured using Pico Green dye as described previously (31Gaca M.D. Zhou X. Issa R. Kiriella K. Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 229-239Google Scholar). The protein samples were electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane after resolution. The membrane was blocked for 1 h in 1–5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Immunodetection was performed as described previously (9Benyon R.C. Hovell C.J. Da Gaca M. Jones E.H. Iredale J.P. Arthur M.J. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 977-986Google Scholar). Reactive bands were identified using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography according to the manufacturer's instructions. Where shown, scanning densitometry analysis was used to quantitate relative expression with Phoretix Advanced 1-D software (Non-Linear Dynamics Ltd., Newcastle, UK).Table IDetails of the antibodies used in this studyPrimary antibodiesWorking concentrationSecondary antibodiesWorking concentrationIntegrin αvaSupplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology.1:1,000Goat anti-rabbit HRPbHRP, horseradish peroxidase.,cSupplied by Sigma.1:5,000Integrin β3aSupplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology.1:1,000Goat anti-rabbit HRPcSupplied by Sigma.1:5,000FAKaSupplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology.1:1,000Goat anti-rabbit HRPcSupplied by Sigma.1:3,000PCNAaSupplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology.1:500Goat anti-rabbit HRPcSupplied by Sigma.1:3,000BCL-2aSupplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology.1:500Goat anti-rabbit HRPcSupplied by Sigma.1:3,000BAXaSupplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology.1:500Goat anti-rabbit HRPcSupplied by Sigma.1:3,000VitronectinaSupplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology.1:2,000Goat anti-mouse HRPcSupplied by Sigma.1:5,000Integrin αvβ3aSupplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology.1:1,000Goat anti-mouse HRPcSupplied by Sigma.1:3,000MMP-9dSupplied by Chemicon.1:2,000Goat anti-mouse HRPcSupplied by Sigma.1:5,000MAPKcSupplied by Sigma.1:2,000Goat anti-mouse HRPcSupplied by Sigma.1:5,000β-ActincSupplied by Sigma.1:500Goat anti-mouse HRPcSupplied by Sigma.1:10,000MMP-14dSupplied by Chemicon.1:1,000Goat anti-rabbit HRPcSupplied by Sigma.1:3,000a Supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology.b HRP, horseradish peroxidase.c Supplied by Sigma.d Supplied by Chemicon. Open table in a new tab Fibrillar Actin (F-actin) Expression of HSCs Examined by Confocal Laser Scanning Analysis—For fluorescent staining, the HSCs cultured in the presence or absence of echistatin or integrin αv siRNA on cover-slips were washed with PBS, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, and then incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. The cells were stained for F-actin with 0.1 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) applied for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. 7-Aminoactinomycin D (Sigma) diluted 1:500 in Tris-buffered saline was used for counterstaining. After staining, cells were mounted by Mowiol (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK) and then observed using an LSM-410 confocal laser scanning microscope and LSM system software version 3.70 or using a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).Examination of Nuclear Morphology Using Acridine Orange—Acridine orange was used to stain cell nuclei to obtain evidence of nuclear fragmentation pathognomonic of apoptosis. Activated HSCs were treated with disintegrins, MMP inhibitors, or other agents as described to induce apoptosis for 6 h in 24-well culture plates containing 500 μlof DMEM with 5% FCS unless otherwise stated. 0.5 μl of acridine orange (1 mg/ml) was added to each well to give a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. After 10 min the number of cells having nuclei with apoptotic morphology (in both supernatant and the cell monolayer) was determined using UV microscopy as described previously (33Murphy F.R. Issa R. Zhou X. Ratnarajah S. Nagase H. Arthur M.J. Benyon C. Iredale J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11069-11076Google Scholar). The recombinant active form of MMP-9 and the MMP-9/-13 inhibitor were from Calbiochem.Caspase-3 Activity Kinetic Assay—Caspase-3 plays a key role in apoptosis of mammalian cells. To examine its activity in treated HSCs, a caspase-3 activity assay kit (Promega) was used that uses a colorimetric substrate, Ac-DEVD-p-nitroanilide, which caspase-3 cleaves to release yellow p-nitroanilide measured by absorbance at 405 nm. Aliquots of 4 × 106 HSCs cultured in 50-ml (25-cm2) flasks were treated with disintegrins for 24 h in DMEM + 5% FCS. Cycloheximide (50 μm), which induces HSC apoptosis, was used to provide a positive control. Detached cells in culture supernatant as well as adherent cells in the monolayer were collected and washed with ice-cold PBS. Protein extracts were prepared following the manufacturer's instructions. Caspase-3 kinetic activity was measured in 96-well microtiter plates by product absorbance at 405 nm after 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, 50-, and 60-min incubation at 37 °C using a Thermomax microplate reader (Amersham Biosciences).Determination of Cell Apoptosis by DNA Fragmentation Assay— Activated HSCs were cultured with or without disintegrins for 24 h in 12-well plates with equal cell seeding (5 × 105 cells/well) determined by trypan blue staining and cell counting. Cells were collected from the supernatant and monolayer, and total DNA was extracted using the Suicide-Track™ DNA ladder isolation kit (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA). DNA isolated from cells was processed according to the manufacturer's instruction (procedure 2 for both intact and fragmented DNA). Total DNA was then subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel at 100 V. A positive control DNA ladder (extracted from HL-60 cells induced into apoptosis with actinomycin) was provided in the kit. DNA ladders were stained using 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized by UV illumination.[3H]Collagen Preparation and Determination of Collagenase Activity in Cultured HSCs Using [3H]Collagen Degradation Assay—Acid-soluble type I collagen was extracted and purified from rat tail using the method described previously by Cawston and Barrett (34Cawston T.E. Barrett A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 340-345Google Scholar). The purity of the final preparation was verified by SDS-PAGE as described by Melkko et al. (35Melkko J. Niemi S. Risteli L. Risteli J. Clin. Chem. 1990; 36: 1328-1332Google Scholar). Radiolabeling of collagen using [3H]acetic anhydride was carried out as described previously (36Mallya S.K. Mookhtiar K.A. Van Wart H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 158: 334-345Google Scholar, 37Dioszegi M. Cannon P. Van Wart H.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 413-431Google Scholar). The 3H-labeled collagen was diluted with unlabeled collagen to obtain a specific activity of 30 cpm/μg(5 μg/μl, 600 cpm/μl). The assay for collagenase activity uses intact collagen as the substrate since the denatured collagen molecule is susceptible to attack by a number of relatively nonspecific proteases, and it is based on the release of 3H-containing peptides from collagen. To determine collagenolytic activity in HSC cultures, 20 μl of 600 cpm/μl [3H]collagen (12,000 cpm) was directly added into cultured HSCs in 24-well plates containing 250 μl of serum-free DMEM + 0.2% bovine serum albumin for a 16-h degradation at 30 °C. Cells monolayers were disrupted by scraping, pooled with supernatant, and transferred into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes from which 50 μl was taken for Pico Green assay to determine the total DNA content. Equal proportions of 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 50 μl of gelatin (20 mg/ml) were added into the tube on ice for precipitation. Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, cleaved 3H-peptides in 500 μl of supernatant were added into 3 ml of scintillation fluid and measured by β-counting. The collagenolytic activity was expressed relative to total DNA in the culture wells and expressed in cpm/μg of DNA.Zymography—10 μl of culture media from HSCs maintained in serum-free DMEM and treated for 24 h with disintegrins were subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing condition in gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatin. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed twice with 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min to remove SDS. The gels were rinsed briefly with distilled H2O and then incubated overnight at 37 °C in proteolysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 5mm CaCl2). The gels were stained with 0.125% Coomassie Brilliant Blue for 10 min and destained in 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol. The 72-kDa proform and 62-kDa activated MMP-2 and 92-kDa proform and 82-kDa activated MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity appeared as a colorless zone against a blue background. Proteolysis buffer with EDTA (10 mm, a pan-MMP inhibitor) and lacking CaCl2 was used as negative control incubation buffer to verify lack of nonspecific gelatin degradation. Densitometry analysis was used to quantitate density of the zones of gelatinase activity in the gel (Phoretix Advanced 1-D software, Non-Linear Dynamics Ltd.).Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as means ± S.E. Significance of the differences between means was assessed using two-tailed Student's t tests. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.

https://openalex.org/W2094778744,"We have identified a mammalian arginine N-methyltransferase, PRMT7, that can catalyze the formation of ω-NG-monomethylarginine in peptides. This protein is encoded by a gene on human chromosome 16q22.1 (human locus AK001502). We expressed a full-length human cDNA construct in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. We found that GST-tagged PRMT7 catalyzes the S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]-l-methionine-dependent methylation of the synthetic peptide GGPGGRGGPGG-NH2 (R1). The radiolabeled peptide was purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography and acid hydrolyzed to free amino acids. When the hydrolyzed products were separated by high-resolution cation-exchange chromatography, we were able to detect one tritiated species which co-migrated with an ω-NG-monomethylarginine standard. Surprisingly, GST-PRMT7 was not able to catalyze the in vitro methylation of a GST-fibrillarin (amino acids 1–148) fusion protein (GST-GAR), a methyl-accepting substrate for the previously characterized PRMT1, PRMT3, PRMT4, PRMT5, and PRMT6 enzymes. Nor was it able to methylate myelin basic protein or histone H2A, in vitro substrates of PRMT5. This specificity distinguishes PRMT7 from all of the other known arginine methyltransferases. An additional unique feature of PRMT7 is that it seems to have arisen from a gene duplication event and contains two putative AdoMet-binding motifs. To see if both motifs were necessary for activity, each putative domain was expressed as a GST-fusion and tested for activity with peptides R1 and R2 (acetyl-GGRGG-NH2). These truncated proteins were enzymatically inactive, suggesting that both domains are required for functionality.

Type I enzymes catalyze the formation of ω-NG-monomethylarginine and ω-NG,NG-asymmetric dimethylarginine residues. Type II enzymes form ω-NG-monomethylarginine and ω-NG,NG′-symmetric dimethylarginine residues. Type III enzymes catalyze only the formation of ω-NG-monomethylarginine residues.

The previously described mammalian enzymes PRMT1, PRMT3, PRMT4/CARM1, and PRMT6 and the yeast enzyme RMT1 have been shown to be responsible for type I methylation (5Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S.

No activity has currently been defined for the mammalian PRMT2 gene product, although its amino acid sequence is similar to that of the other PRMT gene products (17Qi C. Chang J. Zhu Y. Yeldandi A.V.

In searching the human genome for novel protein arginine methyltransferases, we found a gene that appears to code for the seventh PRMT. A recombinantly expressed form of this PRMT is incapable of methylating GST-GAR, MBP, and histone H2A, typical substrates of the previously described protein arginine methyltransferases. However, this methyltransferase, now designated PRMT7, is able to methylate two arginine-containing peptides and exhibited type III enzymatic activity, catalyzing the formation of ω-NG-monomethylarginine residues. A similar species has recently been described in Chinese hamster cells, but the biochemical reaction catalyzed by it has not yet been determined (18Gros L. Delaporte C. Frey S.

Construction of PRMT7, PRMT7ΔC, and PRMT7ΔN Expression Vectors—The plasmid pGEX-PRMT7 was constructed by PCR amplification of a 2.1-kb fragment from a template of an IMAGE human cDNA clone (clone ID 2900965; GenBank accession number AW675040) with primers PRMT7-N1 (5′-CTA GTG TCG ACC ATG AAG ATC TTC TGC AGT CGG GCC-3′) and PRMT7-C1 (5′-CT CGC GGC CGC TCA GTC TTG GGT ATC TGC ATG CCT GAA CTC-3′). The PCR fragment was digested with SalI and NotI and ligated into pGEX(SN) (19Han L. Colicelli J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1318-1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pGEX-PRMT7ΔC was constructed by PCR-amplifying from pGEX-PRMT7 a 1.1-kb fragment with primers PRMT7-N1 and PRMT7-ΔC1 (5′-CTC TCC TCA CCG CGG CCG CTT CAA GAG CAG GTG AGC CTG-3′), which introduces a single N375K mutation to place a NotI site at the 3′ end of the fragment for the purpose of cloning. The PCR product was digested with SalI and NotI and ligated into pGEX(SN). The plasmid pGEX-PRMT7ΔN was constructed by PCR amplification of pGEX-PRMT7 with primers PRMT7-ΔN1 (5′-CTA GTG TCG ACC ATG TTT GGA GAG ATC AAT GAC CAG-3′) and PRMT7-C1, resulting in a 950-bp fragment. PCR fragments were digested with SalI and NotI and ligated into pGEX(SN). Purification of GST-GAR, GST-PRMT1, GST-PRMT7, GST-PRMT7ΔC, and GST-PRMT7ΔN—GST-GAR and GST-PRMT1 were constructed as described previously (11Lin W.J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J.

GST-GAR, GST-PRMT1, GST-PRMT7, GST-PRMT7ΔC, and PRMT7ΔN were overexpressed in Escherichia coli DH5α cells (Invitrogen) by induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were lysed in the presence of 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with seven 20-s sonicator pulses (50% duty; setting 4) on ice with a Sonifier cell disrupter W-350 (Smith-Kline Corp.). The resulting lysate was centrifuged for 40 min at 23,000 × g at 4 °C. The protein was then purified from extracts by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions; the GST-fusion proteins were eluted with 30 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 120 mm NaCl at protein concentrations of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/ml. In Vitro Labeling of MBP, Histone H2A, GST-GAR, Peptide R1, and Peptide R2 and Chemical Analysis of the Methylated Species—10 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) (purified from bovine brain, lyophilized powder; Sigma), 10 μg of histone H2A (purified from calf thymus, Roche Applied Science), 10 μg GST-GAR, 52 μg peptide R1 (GGPGGRGGPG-NH2, California Peptide Research, Inc.) or 26.5 μg of peptide R2 (acetylGGRGG-NH2, California Peptide Research, Inc.) was incubated with 2 μg of GST-PRMT7. 52 μg of peptide R1 or 26.5 μg of peptide R2 were incubated with 2 μg of PRMT7ΔC or PRMT7ΔN. Sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) was added to all reactions to a final concentration of 100 mm. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 3 μl of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine ([3H]AdoMet, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 72.0–79.0 Ci/mmol; 13–14 μm) in a final volume of 60 μl. Reactions were allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 1 h. As a control, 2 μg of GST-GAR was added to 2 μg of GST-PRMT1 and sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) for a final concentration of 100 mm and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 3 μlof[3H]AdoMet in a final volume of 30 μl. Reactions were stopped by freezing on dry ice. The in vitro reactions for MBP, histone H2A, and GST-GAR were mixed with 20 μg of bovine serum albumin as a carrier protein and an equal volume of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in a 6 × 50-mm glass vial and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The precipitated protein was then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 30 min at 25 °C, the supernatant was drawn off and discarded, and the pellets were allowed to air dry. Acid hydrolysis was then carried out on these reactions in a water Pico-Tag Vapor-Phase apparatus in vacuo for 20 h at 110 °C using 200 μl of 6 N HCl. The in vitro reactions for peptides R1 and R2 were added to a 6 × 50-mm glass vial and dried by speed vacuum. 50 μl of 6 N HCl was added to each vial, and the samples were hydrolyzed in vacuo for 20 h at 110 °C. Hydrolyzed samples were resuspended in 50 μl of water and mixed with 1.0 μmol of each of the standard ω-NG-monomethylarginine (ω-MMA, acetate salt, Sigma) and asymmetric ω-NG,NG-dimethylarginine (ADMA, hydrochloride, Sigma) for amino acid analysis by column chromatography. 500 μl of citrate dilution buffer (0.2 m Na+, pH 2.2) was added to the hydrolyzed samples before loading onto a cation-exchange column (Beckman AA-15 sulfonated polystyrene beads; 0.9-cm inner diameter × 7-cm column height) equilibrated and eluted with sodium citrate buffer (0.35 m Na+, pH 5.27) at 1 ml/min at 55 °C. Analysis of Column Fractions—Amino acid standards were determined by a ninhydrin assay as described previously (13Gary J.D. Lin W.J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Radioactivity in column fractions was quantitated using a Beckman LS6500 counter as an average of three 3-min counting cycles. The efficiency of counting was determined to be 36% using a calibrated standard. High-pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Purification of Methylated Peptide R1 and Chemical Analysis of the Purified Methylated Product—520 μg of peptide R1 was added to 20 μg of GST-PRMT7 and incubated with 10 μlof[3H]AdoMet at 37 °C for 5 h in a final volume of 600 μl and a final concentration of 100 mm sodium phosphate. All reactions were stopped by freezing on dry ice. Samples were then thawed and dried under vacuum in a Speed Vac apparatus and resuspended in 60 μl of water. An equal volume of 10% trifluoroacetic acid was added to acidify the reaction and precipitate out the proteins that were present. The sample was spun at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was injected onto a C18 reverse-phase column (5-micron spherical particles, column dimensions 4.6 × 250 mm; Alltech Econo-sphere) equilibrated at room temperature in solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water). At a flow rate of 1 ml/min, the sample was eluted with increasing proportions of solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.9% water in acetonitrile) using the following gradient: 0–5 min, 0% B; 5–55 min, 0–100% B; 55–65 min, 100% B; and 65–70 min, 100–0% B. The column effluent was monitored at 214 nm and 1-ml fractions were collected. Fractions corresponding to the peptide peak were pooled and concentrated under vacuum to ∼200 μl. Samples were reinjected onto the C18 column and eluted under the same conditions as before. Fractions corresponding to the peptide peak were dried under vacuum in a 6 × 50-mm glass vial. 50 μl of 6 N HCl was added to each 6 × 50-mm glass vial, and acid hydrolysis was then carried out on the reactions in a water Pico-Tag Vapor-Phase apparatus in vacuo for 20 h at 110 °C. The hydrolyzed samples were resuspended in 50 μl of water and analyzed on a cation exchange column as described above. UV Crosslinking with [3H]AdoMet—Either 7.2 μg of GST-PRMT7, 3.2 μg of GST-PRMT7ΔC, or 2 μg of GST-PRMT7ΔN were incubated with 0.8 μm [3H]AdoMet (72 Ci/mmol) and 5 mm dithiothreitol in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 50 μl. In control reactions, unlabelled AdoMet (HSO –4 salt, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy, Sigma), 5′-deoxy-5′-methyl-thioadenosine (MTA, Sigma) or ATP (Sigma) were added to a final concentration of 100 μm. Samples were added to 96-well plates and incubated at 4 °C for 20 mins. Samples were exposed to UV irradiation at 254 nm using a Model UVGL-25 Mineralight lamp (UVP, Inc., San Gabriel, CA) held directly against the 96-well plate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of SDS gel sample buffer (180 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.1% â-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed at 35 mA for 4 h using a Laemmli buffer system on a gel prepared with 10% acrylamide and 0.34% N,N-methylene-bisacrylamide (1.5-mm thick, 10.5 cm resolving gel, 2 cm stacking gel). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 30 min and destained in 10% methanol and 5% acetic acid overnight. For fluorography, gels were treated with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Gels were dried at 70 °C in vacuo and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR scientific imaging film at –80 °C. The PRMT family of enzymes exhibits amino acid conservation within the characteristic seven β-strand methyltransferase motifs I, post I, II, and III (20Katz J.E. Dlakic M. Clarke S. Mol. Cell.

This cDNA (locus AK001502) is encoded by a gene on human chromosome 16q22.1 and itself encodes a 692-amino acid hypothetical protein FLJ10640. We compare the sequence of this protein, now designated PRMT7, with the six previously described human PRMTs in Fig. 1. PRMT7, although sharing conserved seven β-strand methyltransferase motifs I and post I with other PRMTs, appears more distantly related at motifs II and III. Significantly, PRMT7 shares additional sequences common to only the PRMT family in the N-terminal region (residues 22–65) in the region between motifs I and post I and at two active-site regions, the “double E” loop and adjacent sequences between motifs II and III, and the THW loop and adjacent sequences at residues 312–330 (21Zhang X. Zhou L. Cheng X. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 24Zhang X. Cheng X. Structure. 2003; 11: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the two glutamate residues are present at the conserved positions in the double E loop, there is only marginal similarity in the residues in between that are generally conserved in most of the other PRMT enzymes. Furthermore, PRMT7 is unique among these enzymes in that the threonine residue of the THW loop is replaced by an aspartic acid residue in PRMT7. A protein-protein BLAST search of the GenBank NR database with the human PRMT7 sequence revealed clear orthologs in a variety of organisms including mice (85% identity over 690 residues), the frog Xenopus laevis (64% identity over 686 residues), the fly Drosophila melanogaster (36% identity over 706 residues), the worm Caenorhabditis elegans (30% identity over 700 residues), and the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana (31% identity over 667 residues). However, we find no homologs in the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe or in prokaryotes. A plasmid encoding a fusion construct of GST and the full-length coding sequence of PRMT7 was expressed in E. coli cells and purified by affinity chromatography, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A single major polypeptide of 108 kDa was observed, consistent with that expected for GST linked to the 692-residue PRMT7 polypeptide (Fig. 2A). We first asked if the GST-PRMT7 fusion protein could bind to the methyl donor AdoMet. GST-PRMT7 was exposed to UV irradiation at 254 nm in the presence of [3H]AdoMet. The reaction mixture was then fractionated by SDS gel electrophoresis and analyzed by fluorography. As shown in Fig. 2B, a radiolabeled band was observed migrating at 108 kDa, corresponding to the GST-PRMT7 fusion polypeptide. In control experiments, addition of the non-isotopically labeled AdoMet and AdoHcy substrate and product fully inhibited the crosslinking reaction, whereas the addition of the UV-absorbing non-substrate ATP had no effect. An intermediate effect was seen with the substrate analog MTA (Fig. 2B). Histones, MBP, and GST-GAR have been used as methyl-accepting substrates to identify, partially purify, and characterize protein-arginine N-methyltransferases (12Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S.

To identify the possible methyltransferase activity of PRMT7, the GST-fusion protein was incubated with GST-GAR, MBP, or histone H2A in the presence of [3H]AdoMet. Protein reaction products were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, acid-hydrolyzed to their amino acid components, and fractionated by high-resolution amino acid cation-exchange chromatography along with standards of unlabeled asymmetric ADMA and ω-MMA (Fig. 3). No protein arginine methyltransferase activity was observed when GST-GAR, MBP, or histone H2A was used as a substrate for GST-PRMT7. However, activity was seen in a control experiment when GST-GAR was used as a substrate for GST-PRMT1 under these conditions (Fig. 3A). Because PRMT7 cannot use these substrates as methyl-acceptors, PRMT7 may have a substrate specificity that is distinct from the other known arginine methyltransferases. The R1 peptide, GGFGGRGGFG-amide, derived from the fibrillarin consensus methyl-acceptor site for PRMT enzymes, has been used to characterize protein-arginine N-methyltransferase activity present in cultured cells and in mammalian tissues along with the activity of PRMT1 (11Lin W.J.

Even though PRMT7 was unable to methylate the parent protein GST-GAR, we decided to ask whether PRMT7 might be able to methylate the consensus site in a peptide context. Reactions with peptide R1 alone, peptide R1 plus GST-PRMT7, or GST-PRMT7 alone were incubated with [3H]AdoMet. The R1 peptide was then separated from other reaction components by C18 HPLC. 3Hradioactivity was found to co-migrate with peptide R1 on the C18 column in all three reaction mixtures (data not shown). However, when the fractions corresponding to the peptide peak were pooled in each case, acid-hydrolyzed, and then fractionated by high-resolution amino acid analysis, we found radioactivity to elute with the ω-NG-monomethylarginine derivative only in the reaction containing GST-PRMT7 and peptide R1, and not in the control reactions containing PRMT7 alone or peptide alone (Fig. 4). Because GST-PRMT7 is able to methylate a small peptide, we decided to see whether PRMT7 could methylate free arginine. We were intrigued by the presence of free ω-NG-monomethylarginine and asymmetric ω-NG,NG-dimethylarginine in mammals and their role as endogenous inhibitors of the nitric oxide signaling pathway (27Leiper J. Vallance P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 28Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33995-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Free arginine (1 mm) was incubated with GST-PRMT7 and [3H]AdoMet. Analysis of the reaction by high-resolution cation exchange chromatography did not reveal the presence of any 3H-methylated arginine derivatives, suggesting that free arginine is not, in fact, a substrate of PRMT7 (data not shown). PRMT7 appears to have resulted from a gene duplication event resulting in two PRMT domains (Fig. 5). The N-terminal half of PRMT7 shown in Fig. 1 (amino acids 1–378) contains a PRMT domain that is most similar to the catalytic core of PRMT5, sharing 33% sequence identity, and is least similar to PRMT2 and PRMT6 (21% identity). The C-terminal half of PRMT7 (amino acids 379–692) shares 26% sequence identity with PRMT1 and 22% sequence identity with the N-terminal half of the protein (Fig. 5). The C-terminal half of PRMT7 shows less conservation in the AdoMet-binding motif I than the N-terminal half and other PRMT enzymes, although it has an identifiable THW loop. To determine whether the PRMT7 domains can function independently, N-terminal and C-terminal fusion proteins (GST-PRMT7ΔC and GST-PRMT7ΔN) were purified from E. coli and analyzed for peptidyl arginine methyltransferase activity. When either peptide R1 (Fig. 6A) or peptide R2 (Fig. 6B) was used as a substrate, neither fusion protein showed any methyltransferase activity, whereas the full-length construct was able to catalyze the formation of ω-NG-monomethylarginine in both peptides. UV crosslinking experiments using [3H]AdoMet were also performed with GST-PRMT7ΔC and GST-PRMT7ΔN. We found that GST-PRMT7ΔC was able to crosslink with [3H]AdoMet, whereas GST-PRMT7ΔN was not (data not shown). As seen with the full-length protein, the addition of AdoMet, AdoHcy, and MTA inhibited the crosslinking of [3H]AdoMet to GST-PRMT7, whereas the addition of ATP had no effect.Fig. 6Deletion of PRMT7 C-terminal or N-terminal domain leads to a loss of methyltransferase activity. Peptide R1 (A) or peptide R2 (B) were incubated with [3H]AdoMet and either GST-PRMT7 (♦), GST-PRMT7ΔC (amino acids 1–378, ▴), or GST-PRMT7ΔN (amino acids 379–992, ▪) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After reactions were dried and acid-hydrolyzed, methylated standards were added, and the hydrolysate was fractionated using cation exchange chromatography, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 3H-radioactivity was determined by counting a 600-μl aliquot of every other fraction diluted with 400 μl of water in 5 ml of fluor three times for 3 min. The unlabeled amino acid standards were analyzed using a ninhydrin assay with 100-μl aliquots of every other fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In a recent study looking for genes that control the cell response to cytotoxic agents, the Chinese hamster ortholog of PRMT7 was identified as a gene corresponding to a genetic suppressor element conferring resistance to a topoisomerase II inhibitor (18Gros L. Delaporte C. Frey S. Decesse J. de Saint-Vincent B.R. Cavarec L. Dubart A. Gudkov A.V. Jacquemin-Sablon A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 164-171PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates of hemagglutinin-tagged PRMT7 from the Chinese hamster cell line DC-3F cells were shown to methylate MBP. Although the methylated product was not identified in this study, it was assumed to be at an arginine residue from the sequence similarities with other PRMT enzymes (18Gros L. Delaporte C. Frey S. Decesse J. de Saint-Vincent B.R. Cavarec L. Dubart A. Gudkov A.V. Jacquemin-Sablon A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 164-171PubMed Google Scholar). However, we show here that human GST-PRMT7 purified from E. coli does not display any detectable methyltransferase activity when MBP is used as a substrate. Because the human and hamster proteins differ at 102 residues, it is possible that this difference is species-dependent. However, it is hard to rule out the possibility that the activity seen with the hamster enzyme preparation may be due to a contaminating PRMT activity in the immunoprecipitated PRMT7, or to the presence of additional subunits or regulatory posttranslational modifications (12Tang J.

In this work, we present direct evidence that GST-PRMT7 is an arginine methyltransferase that can catalyze the formation of ω-NG-monomethylarginine in peptides, although its physiological substrate(s) have yet to be determined. The facts that PRMT7 has an apparent duplication of methyltransferase domains and is incapable of methylating the common PRMT substrates GST-GAR, MBP, or histone H2A distinguishes it from all other known arginine methyltransferases. It is not clear whether PRMT7 may be a peptide-specific enzyme in vivo or may be specific for yet unidentified substrates. It also remains to be determined whether PRMT7 would be capable of the addition of a second methyl group to an arginine residue in an endogenous substrate to generate the asymmetric ADMA residue of type I enzymes or the ω-NG,NG'-symmetric dimethylarginine residues of type II enzymes. It was previously suggested that a crucial difference between enzymes that catalyze type I versus type II methylation reactions is the size of the side chain at the position corresponding to residue 163 in PRMT1 (15Branscombe T.L. Frankel A. Lee J.H. Cook J.R. Yang Z. Pestka S. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32971-32976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 21Zhang X. Zhou L. Cheng X. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Here, the type I PRMT1, PRMT3, PRMT4, and PRMT6 enzymes contain a methionine residue, and the type II PRMT5 enzyme contains a serine residue; the latter may allow the second methylation reaction to occur on the opposite guanidino nitrogen atom. In the case of PRMT7, the residue here is an alanine, suggesting the possibility of type II catalysis."

They reside within the endoplasmic reticulum and belong to the group of 2-oxoglutarate and iron-dependent dioxygenases. Although prolyl 4-hydroxylase has been characterized as an α2β2 tetramer in which protein disulfide isomerase is the β subunit with two different α subunit isoforms, little is known about the enzyme prolyl 3-hydroxylase (P3H). It was initially characterized and shown to have an enzymatic activity distinct from that of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, but no amino acid sequences or genes were ever reported for the mammalian enzyme. Here we report the characterization of a novel prolyl 3-hydroxylase enzyme isolated from embryonic chicks. The primary structure of the enzyme, which we now call P3H1, demonstrates that P3H1 is a member of a family of prolyl 3-hydroxylases, which share the conserved residues present in the active site of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase. P3H1 is the chick homologue of mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1. Two other P3H family members are the genes previously called MLAT4 and GRCB. In this study we demonstrate prolyl 3-hydroxylase activity of the purified enzyme P3H1 on a full-length procollagen substrate. We also show it to specifically interact with denatured collagen and to exist in a tight complex with other endoplasmic reticulum-resident proteins. Immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody specific for chick P3H1 localizes P3H1 specifically to tissues that express fibrillar collagens, suggesting that other P3H family members may be responsible for modifying basement membrane collagens.

The biosynthesis of collagen involves a number of unique post-translational modifications that are catalyzed by several specific enzymes. Hydroxylation of the appropriate prolyl and lysyl residues to 4-hydroxyprolyl, 3-hydroxyprolyl, and hydroxylysyl residues is a modification required inside the cell to ensure proper folding and assembly of procollagen. These modifications occur because of the enzymatic activities of specific rough endoplasmic reticulum-resident (rER) 1The abbreviations used are: rER, rough endoplasmic reticulum; P3H, prolyl 3-hydroxylase; P4H, prolyl 4-hydroxylase; LH, lysyl hydroxylase; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; CYPB, cyclophilin B; CRTAP, cartilage-associated protein. proteins (1Kivirikko K.I.

Prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H), prolyl 3-hydroxylase (P3H), and lysyl hydroxylase (LH) all belong to the group of 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenases and require Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, O2, and ascorbate for their activity. The 2-oxoglutarate is stoichiometrically decarboxylated during hydroxylation, with one atom of the O2 molecule incorporated into succinate, whereas the other is incorporated into the hydroxy group formed on the proline or lysine residue. P4Hs catalyze the formation of 4-hydroxyproline by the hydroxylation of prolines in -Xaa-Pro-Gly-sequences in collagens and more than 15 other proteins that have collagen-like domains (1Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). P4H exists as a α2β2 tetramer with a molecular mass of ∼240,000 daltons. Two isoforms of the catalytic α subunit have been characterized and shown to form [α(I)2β2] and [α(II)2β2] tetramers, the β subunit of which is identical to the chaperone protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (3Parkkonen T.

A third isoform of the α subunit, cloned just recently, was characterized and found to be expressed at lower levels than the other two isoforms in human tissues (5Kukkola L. Hieta R. Kivirikko K.I.

There also exists a family of cytoplasmic prolyl 4-hydroxylases, the hypoxia-inducible factor P4Hs that catalyze the hydroxylation of the α subunit of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor and play a key role in the response of cells to hypoxia (6Bruick R.K.

The lysyl hydroxylases are a family of three proteins, LH1-3, that catalyze the hydroxylation of -Xaa-Lys-Gly-sequences. Their activity is essential for the stability of the intermolecular collagen cross-links, and their hydroxy groups serve as attachment sites for carbohydrate units (1Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is little primary sequence identity between the P4Hs and LHs, they share conserved catalytic residues in their active sites (2Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 10Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In collagen, 4-hydroxylation of proline residues is crucial for the formation of the triple helix (11Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Almost all proline residues in the Yaa position of the -Gly-Xaa-Yaa-repeated sequence are hydroxylated to 4(R)-hydroxyproline by prolyl 4-hydroxylase. 3(S)-hydroxyproline is found in almost all collagens in the sequence -Gly-3Hyp-3Hyp-Gly- (12Fietzek P.P. Rexrodt F.W. Wendt P. Stark M. Kuhn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 30: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Fietzek P.P. Kuhn K. Int. Rev. Connect.

The role of 3(S)hydroxyproline in the Xaa position of all collagens is not well understood. The extent of 3-hydroxylation varies with the different types of collagens and occurs in the largest amounts in collagen types IV and V (15Rhodes R.K. Miller E.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3442-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 16Kefalides N.A. Int. Rev. Connect. Tissue Res. 1973; 6: 63-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prolyl 3-hydroxylase and prolyl 4-hydroxylase activities have been shown to be derived from separate proteins (17Tryggvason K. Risteli J. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 76: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Risteli J. Tryggvason K. Kivirikko K.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 73: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), however no amino acid sequences or genes have ever been reported for prolyl 3-hydroxylase. P3H was reported to be purified 5000-fold from a chick embryo extract, and its molecular mass was estimated to be 160,000 daltons by gel filtration (19Tryggvason K. Majamaa K. Risteli J. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study we report the identification and characterization of a prolyl 3-hydroxylase purified from chick embryos. The translated sequence of the cloned prolyl 3-hydroxylase gene, as well as partial amino acid sequences from the purified protein, indicates that it is the chick homologue of leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1). Leprecan was initially identified from a rat cDNA library as a basement membrane-associated proteoglycan, which was also shown to possess the endoplasmic reticulum retention signal KDEL (20Wassenhove-McCarthy D.J. McCarthy K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25004-25017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Subsequently the mouse homologue to leprecan, Gros1, was cloned and found to be a potential growth suppressor on chromosome 1 (21Kaul S.C. Sugihara T. Yoshida A. Nomura H. Wadhwa R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3576-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Leprecan was then classified as a member of the 2-oxoglutarate- and iron-dependent dioxygenases using sequence profile searches and protein fold recognition to propose a biological function for unknown proteins (22Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (RESEARCH0007)Crossref Google Scholar). Based on the results presented here, we choose to call the protein prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1. We also have identified two homologous gene sequences that we predict to be other members of this novel P3H family. We show this enzyme to have prolyl 3-hydroxylase activity in a previously described assay with full-length procollagen (26Risteli J. Tryggvason K. Kivirikko K.I. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 84: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Gelatin-Sepharose affinity chromatography, used previously to identify proteins that bind to denatured collagen (23Saga S. Nagata K. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 24Zeng B. MacDonald J.R. Bann J.G. Beck K. Gambee J.E. Boswell B.A. Bachinger H.P. Biochem.

Finally, immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody to P3H1 demonstrates its presence in tissues that express fibrillar collagens. Gelatin-Sepharose Affinity Chromatography and Enzyme Purification—P3H and P4H were isolated from 15-day-old chick embryos by affinity chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) (23Saga S. Nagata K. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 24Zeng B. MacDonald J.R. Bann J.G. Beck K. Gambee J.E. Boswell B.A. Bachinger H.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 12 dozen chicken embryos were mixed with an equal volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.25 m sucrose and proteinase inhibitors (5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Homogenization was carried out in a Waring blender at maximum speed for 3 min. This and all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 15 min in a H-6000A rotor (Sorvall). The supernatant was then centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 1 h in a 45 Ti rotor (Beckman). The resulting pellets were resuspended in twice the volume of 50 mm Tris-HOAc buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20, 0.15 m NaCl, and the same protease inhibitors as described above, treated with 1 μl/ml diisopropyl fluorophosphate (2 mm), and stirred gently overnight on ice. The extract was centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 1 h, filtered through cheesecloth and Miracloth, and run over a gelatin-Sepharose 4B column (2.6 × 30 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HOAc buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 m NaCl and 0.05 (v/v) % Tween 20). The column was washed with at least two bed volumes of buffer A and then with two bed volumes of 50 mm Tris-HOAc buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 m NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20 followed by another bed volume of buffer A. Elution was performed using a pH gradient from 7.5 to 5.0 with buffer A. Peak fractions containing P3H and P4H were pooled, dialyzed into PBS (Invitrogen) at 4 °C, and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter prior to being loaded onto the monoclonal antibody affinity column. Sequencing and identification of the majority of the proteins in the low pH elution peak from the gelatin-Sepharose affinity chromatography have been described previously (24Zeng B. MacDonald J.R. Bann J.G. Beck K. Gambee J.E. Boswell B.A. Bachinger H.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Gene Sequencing and Alignments—For the P3H1 sequencing, SDS-polyacrylamide gels were run with the gelatin-Sepharose-eluted material, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein bands of interest were cut out and either sequenced directly or proteolytically digested, and the resulting fragments were then sequenced. Degenerate primers were synthesized, and PCR was performed using cDNA from cultured chick tendon fibroblasts from 15-day embryonic chicks. (Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA was then reverse transcribed using Super-Script II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen).) Resulting PCR fragments were sequenced and then used to create new primers. RACE PCR was used to clone the remainder of the gene using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences) following instructions in the user's manual. Full-length sequences were verified by aligning them with sequences obtained from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) chick data base (www.chick.umist.ac.uk) and by repeated PCR amplification and sequencing of the P3H1 gene. Alignments were done using the Vector NTI version 7 software (Infor-Max, Inc.). Antibodies and Immunoaffinity Chromatography—The mouse monoclonal antibody 1C10 was generated using the pooled peak fractions from the gelatin-Sepharose low pH eluted material as the immunogen. The antibody was produced and selected by standard methods, and the specificity of the antibody was determined using immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques. The antibody, which recognizes both nonreduced and reduced (at much lower affinity) P3H1, was used to create an affinity column for the purpose of protein purification. Briefly, a 2-ml column was created using ∼10 mg of the 1C10 antibody and Aminolink Plus Coupling Gel (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Pooled and dialyzed peak fractions from the gelatin-Sepharose elution were then loaded onto the antibody column, and the flow-through was collected and concentrated for further purification of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and PDI by sieve chromatography on Superose 12 resin (Amersham Biosciences). The 1C10 antibody column was washed with 5 volumes of PBS (procedure described in Ref. 39Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. 1. John Wiley and Sons, New York1996: 9.5.1-9.5.11Google Scholar), and then washed with 5 volumes of wash buffer B containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 to elute associated proteins. P3H1 was eluted in 50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and then dialyzed extensively into 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl, aliquoted, and frozen at -20 °C for future use in enzyme assays (see below). Sequences of proteins eluted with the wash buffer B were determined by Edman degradation in a protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencer). In the case of proteins in which the N termini were blocked, peptides for sequencing were prepared by digestion with trypsin followed by separation on a Vydac C18 reversed-phase column. Labeled Substrate Preparation and Enzyme Assays—Prolyl 3-hydroxylase activity was measured based on the amount of tritiated water formed from a labeled procollagen substrate (25Kivirikko K.I.

The cells were preincubated for 30 min in 0.3 mm α,α′-dipyridyl and then for an additional 4 h with 500 μCi of l-[2,3-3H]proline. The nonhydroxylated procollagen was extracted with 0.1 m acetic acid (28Berg R.A. Prockop D.J. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3395-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was dialyzed at 4 °C into 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 200 mm NaCl, heated to 100 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove the precipitate formed during heating. The supernatant was incubated with ∼5 μg of purified chick prolyl 4-hydroxylase for 4 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 10 ml containing 0.08 mm FeSO4, 2 mm ascorbic acid, 0.5 mm 2-oxoglutarate, and 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, to convert all appropriate prolyl residues to 4-hydroxylprolyl residues (17Tryggvason K. Risteli J. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 76: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The solution was dialyzed into 200 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and then stored in aliquots at -70 °C. The substrate was heated at 100 °C for 10 min immediately before use. The prolyl 3-hydroxylase reactions were performed as described previously (17Tryggvason K. Risteli J. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The enzyme reaction was carried out for 60 min at 24 °C in a final volume of 2.0 ml containing 1 × 106 dpm of l-[2,3-3H]proline-labeled substrate, 0.08 mm FeSO4, 2 mm ascorbic acid, 0.5 mm 2-oxoglutarate, 0.2 mg/ml catalase, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the tritiated water formed was assayed by vacuum distillation of the whole reaction mixture (25Kivirikko K.I. Myllyla R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 26Risteli J. Tryggvason K. Kivirikko K.I. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 84: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A 1.8-ml aliquot of the tritiated water was mixed with 10 ml of Ecolume liquid scintillation mixture (ICN) and counted in a Beckman LS5000TD liquid scintillation counter. The prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity was assayed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (25Kivirikko K.I. Myllyla R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed in a final volume of 1.0 ml, which contained 0.1 mg of (Pro-Pro-Gly)10·9 H2O as substrate, 2 mm ascorbic acid, 0.05 mm FeSO4, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml catalase, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 0.1 mm 2-oxo[l-14C]glutarate (100,000 dpm). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of 1 m KH2PO4, pH 5.0. Immunohistochemistry—Light microscopic immunohistochemical procedures were performed as been described previously (29Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 29-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissues were frozen in hexanes prior to cryosectioning. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) was used for immunofluorescence microscopy, using 8-μm cryosections. The monoclonal antibody 201 against fibrillin-1 has been described previously (30Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J.

Prolyl 3-Hydroxylases Are a Novel Family of Proteins—In this study we identify prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 as a novel rER protein present in chick embryo rER extracts partially purified by affinity chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose. As we have previously reported, proteins from rER-enriched extracts can be selected according to their interactions with gelatin (denatured collagen) (24Zeng B. MacDonald J.R. Bann J.G. Beck K. Gambee J.E. Boswell B.A. Bachinger H.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Eluted proteins were run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and bands were cut out for amino-terminal sequencing. Partially purified proteins were also subjected to limited trypsin digestions to obtain internal amino acid sequences (data not shown). Degenerate primers were synthesized, and PCR experiments were performed to obtain gene fragments. After an initial PCR fragment was cloned and sequenced, RACE PCR was used to clone the remainder of the gene. Sequence searches against the human and mouse genomes identified three separate genes as potential orthologs of the chick protein we had cloned. Further analysis of all of the nucleotide and translated sequences demonstrated the presence of three closely related genes in all three species (human, mouse, and chicken), one of which clearly matched the published sequence of leprecan or Gros1 and the gene we had cloned from chicken embryos. The names P3H1, -2, and -3 correspond to the human genes leprecan on chromosome 1, MLAT4 on chromosome 3, and GRCB on chromosome 12, respectively. They are classified as such based on identity; for example, the translated human sequences for P3H1 and P3H2 are 46% identical, for P3H1 and P3H3 are 41% identical, and for P3H2 and P3H3 are 38% identical. The chicken P3H3 sequence is not yet complete. Fig. 1 is an alignment of the translated amino acid sequence of all three genes from human and mouse and two genes from chicken. The carboxyl-terminal portion of all of the molecules is highly conserved and contains critical catalytic residues shared with the lysyl and prolyl 4-hydroxylase enzymes (Fig. 1, indicated with an asterisk) including the two Fe2+-binding histidines and an aspartic acid residue. Additionally these enzymes share a positively charged residue (lysine in P4H and arginine in LH) at position +10, with respect to the second iron-binding histidine, which is important for binding the C-5 carboxyl group of 2-oxoglutarate (1Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). The only known exception to this rule thus far is the hypoxia-inducible factor asparaginyl hydroxylase (FIH) in which the residue binding the C-5 carboxyl group of the 2-oxoglutarate is a lysine in position +15 with respect to the first iron-binding histidine (33Hewitson K.S. McNeill L.A. Riordan M.V. Tian Y.M. Bullock A.N. Welford R.W. Elkins J.M. Oldham N.J. Bhattacharya S. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. J. Biol.

More variations are found in the amino-terminal portion of the molecules across families and species; however, all family members contain four repeats of CXXXC, of unknown function, in that region of the molecule (indicated by a + sign in Fig. 1) Finally, all proteins contain the rER retention signal at their carboxyl-terminal end, indicating that they are likely to be resident ER proteins. P3H1 Binds to Denatured Collagen and Exists in a Complex of Proteins—As reported previously, protein extracts from the rER enriched fraction of 15-day-old chick embryos bind to gelatin-Sepharose (24Zeng B. MacDonald J.R. Bann J.G. Beck K. Gambee J.E. Boswell B.A. Bachinger H.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This method was initially developed as a functional assay to identify proteins or complexes of proteins that associate with unfolded or partially folded collagen in the rER during collagen biosynthesis. Molecules that bound specifically were identified and are now known to perform vital roles in the post-translational modifications and processing of the nascent procollagen molecules, such as two members of the peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase family, cyclophilin B (CYPB) and FKBP65, as well as HSP47 and the collagen P4H and PDI. After a high salt wash to remove loosely bound proteins, proteins bound to gelatin-Sepharose were eluted with low pH buffer (Fig. 2A). In addition to the proteins mentioned above, another protein with an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa on SDS-PAGE was present in the low pH eluted material. We cloned and sequenced the 90-kDa protein and identified it as the chicken homologue of leprecan or what we call herein P3H1. The fact that P3H1 can be specifically eluted from gelatin-Sepharose columns suggests that it may bind directly to denatured collagen or that is exists in a complex of proteins that bind to denatured collagen. We raised a monoclonal antibody against the chicken P3H1 protein and used it to make an affinity column to further purify the enzyme. During these procedures it became evident that P3H1 forms strong complexes with other proteins eluted from the gelatin affinity column. Fig. 2B shows a reduced SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Blue of the proteins that are specifically eluted off of the P3H1 antibody column. Initially the column was loaded with the eluted extract from the gelatin-Sepharose affinity step, as shown in Fig. 2A, and then washed extensively in PBS. The column was then washed with a more stringent buffer (pH 6 and 0.5 m NaCl), and two proteins were specifically eluted (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-4). They had apparent mobilities on SDS-PAGE of 21 and 46 kDa. Amino-terminal sequencing of these bands as well as tryptic digestions of the protein with a blocked amino terminus (CRTAP) identified these proteins as cyclophilin B (CYPB) and the cartilage-associated protein CRTAP. Purified P3H1 was then eluted with a low pH buffer (Fig. 2B, lanes 5-8). In Fig. 2C the P3H1 antibody column was not washed with the midrange buffer but eluted immediately following the PBS washes. All three proteins eluted simultaneously (CYPB, CRTAP, and P3H1), with P3H1 apparently the most abundant (Fig. 2C, lanes 1-4). These results suggest the likelihood of P3H1 not only associating intracellularly with unfolded collagen molecules but also with other proteins in a specific manner.

https://openalex.org/W2008537833,"We have examined overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) to determine if it modifies the anti-proliferative effect of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β against MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells. Exogenous TGF-β inhibited cell proliferation and induced Smad-dependent transcriptional reporter activity in both MCF-10A/HER2 and MCF-10A/vector control cells. Ligand-induced reporter activity was 7-fold higher in HER2-overexpressing cells. In wound closure and transwell assays, TGF-β induced motility of HER2-transduced, but not control cells. The HER2-blocking antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) prevented TGF-β-induced cell motility. Expression of a constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor (ALK5T204D) induced motility of MCF-10A/HER2 but not MCF-10A/vector cells. TGF-β-induced motility was blocked by coincubation with either the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor U0126, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, and an integrin β1 blocking antibody. Rac1 activity was higher in HER2-overexpressing cells, where both Rac1 and Pak1 proteins were constitutively associated with HER2. Both exogenous TGF-β and transduction with constitutively active ALK5 enhanced this association. TGF-β induced actin stress fibers as well as lamellipodia within the leading edge of wounds. Herceptin blocked basal and TGF-β-stimulated Rac1 activity but did not repress TGF-β-stimulated transcriptional reporter activity. These data suggest that 1) overexpression of HER2 in nontumorigenic mammary epithelial is permissive for the ability of TGF-β to induce cell motility and Rac1 activity, and 2) HER2 and TGF-β signaling cooperate in the induction of cellular events associated with tumor progression.

IntroductionThe transforming growth factors (TGF-β) 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor; TβRII, TGF-β type II receptor; MMTV, murine mammary tumor virus; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; HA, hemagglutinin; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; GST-PBD, glutathione S-transferase fused with the Pak family binding domain for Cdc42/Rac1; EST, Expressed Sequence Tag; IL, interleukin. are polypeptides that are part of the superfamily of structurally related ligands that include the TGF-βs, activins, and bone morphogenetic proteins. TGF-β ligands can modulate cell proliferation, lineage determination, functional differentiation, extracellular matrix production, cell motility, and apoptosis (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Google Scholar). TGF-β was originally reported to induce anchorage-independent growth of mouse fibroblasts (2Moses H.L. Branum E.L. Proper J.A. Robinson R.A. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 2842-2848Google Scholar). Later studies indicated that TGF-β is a potent inhibitor of epithelial cell proliferation (3Roberts A.B. Anzano M.A. Wakefield L.M. Roche N.S. Stern D.F. Sporn M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 119-123Google Scholar, 4Tucker R.F. Shipley G.D. Moses H.L. Holley R.W. Science. 1984; 226: 705-707Google Scholar), suggesting a role in tumor suppression. Transgenic mice expressing active TGF-β1S223/225 in the mammary gland exhibit delayed ductal morphogenesis, renewal capacity, and functional differentiation (5Pierce Jr., D.F. Johnson M.D. Matsui Y.

Inhibition of autocrine TGF-β signaling in the mouse mammary gland by tissue-specific expression of a truncated dominant-negative TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) results in accelerated lobulo-alveolar development (8Gorska A.E. Joseph H. Derynck R. Moses H.L. Serra R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 229-238Google Scholar) and enhanced propensity for the development of carcinogen-induced lung, mammary, and skin tumors (9Bottinger E.P. Jakubczak J.L. Haines D.C. Bagnall K. Wakefield L.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5564-5570Google Scholar, 10Go C. Li P. Wang X.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2861-2868Google Scholar) as well as spontaneous invasive mammary carcinomas (11Gorska A.E. Jensen R.A. Shyr Y. Aakre M.E. Bhowmick N.A. Moses H.L. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1539-1549Google Scholar). Mice with targeted disruption of either the Tgfb1 or the Smad3 genes develop colon adenomas and carcinomas (12Engle S.J. Hoying J.B. Boivin G.P. Ormsby I. Gartside P.S. Doetschman T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3379-3386Google Scholar, 13Zhu Y. Richardson J.A. Parada L.F. Graff J.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 703-714Google Scholar). Mice heterozygous for deletion of the Tgfb1 gene express 10-30% of the TGF-β1 protein, and this partial loss is sufficient to attenuate epithelial growth restraint and inhibit tumor suppression function, resulting in enhanced carcinogen-induced liver and lung tumors (14Tang B. Bottinger E.P. Jakowlew S.B. Bagnall K.M. Mariano J. Anver M.R. Letterio J.J. Wakefield L.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 802-807Google Scholar). MMTV/TGF-β1 mice are resistant to (7,12-dimethylbenz[a]-anthracene)-induced mammary tumors, and when cross-bred with mice expressing the EGF receptor ligand TGF-α in the mammary gland (MMTV/TGF-α), the bigenic (TGF-β/TGF-α) progeny fails to develop TGF-α-induced mammary hyperplasias and carcinomas while still exhibiting a hypoplastic phenotype (15Pierce Jr., D.F. Gorska A.E. Chytil A. Meise K.S. Page D.L. Coffey Jr., R.J. Moses H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4254-4258Google Scholar). Finally, mice overexpressing active TGF-β1 under the control of the K14 keratinocyte-specific promoter are relatively protected from skin tumors induced by chemical carcinogens (16Cui W. Fowlis D.J. Bryson S. Duffie E. Ireland H. Balmain A. Akhurst R.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 531-542Google Scholar), further supporting the tumor suppressive role of TGF-β signaling.Most cancer cells lose or attenuate TGF-β-mediated antiproliferative effects either by mutational inactivation of TGF-β receptors or their signal transducers or by less known mechanisms (for review, see Refs. 17Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Google Scholar, 18Wakefield L.M. Roberts A.B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 22-29Google Scholar, 19Siegel P.M. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-820Google Scholar). There is also abundant experimental evidence to support that excess production and/or activation of TGF-β in tumors, including breast cancers, can foster cancer progression by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms (for review, see Ref. 20Dumont N. Arteaga C.L. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 531-536Google Scholar). These include enhancement of tumor cell motility and survival, increase in tumor neo-angiogenesis and extracellular matrix production, up-regulation of peritumor metalloproteases, and inhibition of host immune surveillance mechanisms (17Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Google Scholar, 21Dumont N. Arteaga C.L. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 125-132Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of active TGF-β1 or an activated type I TGF-β receptor (TβRI) in the mammary gland of transgenic mice results in acceleration of metastases derived from neu-induced primary mammary tumors (22Siegel P.M. Shu W. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Massague J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8430-8435Google Scholar, 23Muraoka R.S. Koh Y. Roebuck L.R. Sanders M.E. Brantley-Sieders D. Gorska A.E. Moses H.L. Arteaga C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8691-8703Google Scholar). Furthermore, in transgenic mice expressing the Polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyVmT) in mammary epithelium, blockade of TGF-β with a soluble fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of TβRII and the Fc domain of human IgG1 (sTβRII:Fc) results in increased apoptosis in primary mammary tumors and a reduction in both circulating tumor cells and lung metastases (24Muraoka R.S. Dumont N. Ritter C.A. Dugger T.C. Brantley D.M. Chen J. Easterly E. Roebuck L.R. Ryan S. Gotwals P.J. Koteliansky V. Arteaga C.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1551-1559Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that 1) TGF-β can suppress some but not all oncogenic signals in epithelial cells, and 2) some oncogenes can engage TGF-β signaling and utilize it for tumor maintenance and progression.We have studied the HER2 proto-oncogene product, the human homolog of erbB2 and neu, to determine if it modulates cellular responses to TGF-β in MCF-10A nontumorigenic human mammary epithelial cells. The HER2 protein is a member of the erbB family of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases, which also includes the EGF receptor (HER1, erbB1), HER3 (erbB3), and HER4 (erbB4). Binding of ligands to EGFR, HER3, and HER4 induces the formation of homodimeric and heterodimeric, kinase-active complexes to which HER2 is recruited as a preferred partner (25Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Google Scholar). Even though HER2 is unable to interact directly with receptor ligands, it can amplify signaling pathways activated by erbB co-receptors, which include phospholipase Cγ-1, Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt-p70S6 kinase, Pak-JNKK-JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase), stress-activated protein kinases, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (26Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Google Scholar). Some of these pathways such as ERK, p38 MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase are also stimulated by TGF-β in some cells (18Wakefield L.M. Roberts A.B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 22-29Google Scholar, 27Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Google Scholar), thus providing a biochemical basis for synergy between TGF-β and erbB receptor signaling.As indicated above, TGF-β can suppress TGF-α-induced transformation in the mammary gland (15Pierce Jr., D.F. Gorska A.E. Chytil A. Meise K.S. Page D.L. Coffey Jr., R.J. Moses H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4254-4258Google Scholar). Furthermore, TGF-β can also suppress EGF-induced mitogenesis in epithelial cells (28Coffey Jr., R.J. Sipes N.J. Bascom C.C. Graves-Deal R. Pennington C.Y. Weissman B.E. Moses H.L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1596-1602Google Scholar). These results imply that TGF-β is dominant over the EGF receptor. Because of the ability of HER2 to signal with increased potency than the EGF receptor (26Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Google Scholar), we speculated that overexpression of HER2 may prevent TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition and/or modulate other cellular responses of non-transformed mammary epithelial cells to this ligand. In this report, the proliferation of MCF-10A cells overexpressing stably transduced HER2 was still delayed by exogenous TGF-β. However, MCF-10A/HER2 cells exhibited increased motility and Rac1 activity in response to TGF-β, suggesting that HER2 and TGF-β signals can cooperate in inducing cellular events required for tumor progression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Reagents—MCF-10A cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with horse serum, l-glutamine, human recombinant EGF (Calbiochem), cholera toxin (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), insulin (Calbiochem), and hydrocortisone (Sigma). Experiments were performed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium /F-12 medium supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (fraction V). 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. All tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen unless otherwise specified. Human recombinant TGF-β1 was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and the humanized IgG1 HER2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) was purchased from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Pharmacy. ZD1839 (Iressa) was kindly provided by Alan Wakeling (AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, UK). LY294002 and SB202190 were from Calbiochem, U-0126 was from Promega (Madison, WI), and the integrin β1 blocking antibody was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA).Retroviral and Adenoviral Vectors—c-Myc-tagged HER2 cDNA (provided by Dr. James Staros, Vanderbilt University) was excised using XbaI/HindIII enzymes, purified by agarose-gel electrophoresis, and converted to blunt ends with Klenow DNA polymerase. The retroviral expression vector pBMN-IRES-EGFP (29Grignani F. Kinsella T. Mencarelli A. Valtieri M. Riganelli D. Lanfrancone L. Peschle C. Nolan G.P. Pelicci P.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 14-19Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. Gary Nolan, Stanford University) was digested with SnaBI and dephosphorylated at the 5′-ends with alkaline phosphatase (Promega). The blunt-ended vector and the HER2 cDNA were ligated and then replicated in DH5α (Invitrogen). To confirm that the HER2 insert had no truncations, the vector was digested with StuI and also sequenced using the primer 5′-GACCTTACACAGTCCTGC-3′. Restriction enzymes, T4-DNA ligase, and DNA polymerases were all from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). 293T retrovirus-packaging cells (2.5 × 106/60-mm dish; ATCC) were transfected with 5 μg of pBMN-HER2-IRES-EGFP or 5 μg of pBMN-IRES-EGFP (control) for 24 h using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). For each case, cells were cotransfected with 3 μg of pHCMV-G (30Yee J.K. Miyanohara A. LaPorte P. Bouic K. Burns J.C. Friedmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9564-9568Google Scholar) and 3 μg of pSV-Ψ-env-MLV (pSV-pol/gag) (31Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5110-5113Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. Jane Burns, University of California, San Diego, CA). Virus-containing medium was collected 48-72 h later and passed through a 45-μm filter. MCF-10A cells (105/60-mm dish) were transduced with control or HER2-encoding retroviral vectors for 2 h. After 5 passages, cells stably expressing EGFP were sorted by flow cytometry and expanded. EGFP expression was monitored with an inverted fluorescent microscope and maintained at 100% throughout all experiments.The hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ALK5T204D adenoviral construct was provided by Dr. Kohei Miyazono (Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan). Stock of recombinant viruses was replicated in 293 cells and titered using the adenovirus expression vector kit (Takara Biomedicals, Tokyo). MCF-10A cells were infected with ALK5T204D or a control β-galactosidase adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units per cell for 1 h, unless otherwise specified. After 48 h, β-galactosidase expression was assessed using the β-galactosidase enzyme system (Promega). Expression of HA-tagged mutant ALK5 was confirmed by HA and TβRI immunoblot analyses.Immunoblot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin. Protein content was quantitated using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described previously (32Dumont N. Bakin A.V. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3275-3285Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (32Dumont N. Bakin A.V. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3275-3285Google Scholar) after preclearing cell lysates with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. The antibodies utilized were HER2 (erbB2 Ab1) and HER3 (erbB3 C-17; NeoMarkers, Union City, CA), c-Myc (9E10; Roche Applied Science), HA, TβRI (V22), and Pak1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Rac1 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), and Tyr(P) monoclonal (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY).Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were harvested by trypsinization and labeled with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) containing 125 units/ml protease-free RNase (Calbiochem). A total of 10,000 stained nuclei were analyzed in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) as described previously (33Shin I. Bakin A.V. Rodeck U. Brunet A. Arteaga C.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3328-3339Google Scholar).Cell Motility Assays and BrdUrd Incorporation—Cell motility was assessed in wound closure assays as described previously (32Dumont N. Bakin A.V. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3275-3285Google Scholar). For wound closure experiments, cells were allowed to reach confluence in serum-containing complete growth medium and then incubated for 16 h in serum-free medium before the addition of TGF-β or other inhibitors. Wound closure was monitored by microscopy at various times. In some cases wounded monolayers were incubated with BrdUrd (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for 3 h and then stained with a biotinylated BrdUrd antibody according to the BrdUrd staining kit protocol (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Transwell migration was performed utilizing 5-μm pore, polycarbonate filters (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) as described (32Dumont N. Bakin A.V. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3275-3285Google Scholar). Cells migrated to the underside of transwell filters were fixed, stained with Diff-Quick (Düdingen, Switzerland), and counted by bright field microscopy at 200× in five random fields.Transcription Reporter Assays—Cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected with 3 μg/35-mm dish of the Smad-dependent reporter construct p(CAGA)12-luciferase (provided by J.-M. Gauthier, Laboratoire GlaxoSmithKline, Les Ulis Cedex, France) along with 0.02 μg/well of pCMV-Renilla using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Firefly and Renilla reniformis luciferase activities were measured using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega), and the data were normalized utilizing the ratio of firefly to R. reniformis luciferase as described previously (32Dumont N. Bakin A.V. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3275-3285Google Scholar).Immunofluorescent Microscopy—Cells were treated with TGF-β1 on glass coverslips and then fixed and permeabilized as described previously (34Bakin A.V. Rinehart C. Tomlinson A.K. Arteaga C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3193-3206Google Scholar) followed by incubation with phalloidin-Texas Red (2 units/ml in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min; Molecular Probes). Fluorescent images of coverslips mounted in AquaPolyMount (Polysciences) were captured using a Princeton Instruments cooled CCD digital camera from a Zeiss Axiophot upright microscope.Rac1 Activity Assay—The pGEX plasmid containing GST-PBD (glutathione S-transferase fused with the Pak family binding domain for Cdc42/Rac1) (35Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Google Scholar) was a gift from R. Cerione (Cornell University, New York, NY). GST-PBD was expressed in Escherichia coli and immobilized by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads after the GST gene fusion system protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Fifty μg of GST-PBD were incubated with 800 μg of protein from precleared cell lysates for 3 h at 4 °C. GST-PBD was affinity-precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), and the adsorbed proteins were eluted from the beads by suspending them in Laemmli sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and Rac1 immunoblot analysis as described previously (34Bakin A.V. Rinehart C. Tomlinson A.K. Arteaga C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3193-3206Google Scholar).cDNA Array and Northern Analysis—Cells were incubated for 16 h in serum-free medium and then treated with TGF-β1 for 24 h. Total RNAs were isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), digested with RNase-free DNase (0.1 unit/1 μg RNA; Promega), and purified using a silica gel column (RNeasy Kit, Qiagen). Purified RNAs (50 μg) were reverse-transcribed to cDNAs, and these were labeled with Cy3-conjugated dCTP (MCF-10A/HER2) or Cy5-conjugated dCTP (MCF-10A/vector). The procedures for reverse transcription, RNA template digestion, and cDNA purification and hybridization to a human 5000 cDNA array were performed following the protocols listed in www.array.vanderbilt.edu. Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNAs were scanned at 532 and 635 nm, respectively, in GenePix Pro (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). DNA polymerase, primers, and fluorescent dye-conjugated nucleotides were from Invitrogen unless otherwise specified. For Northern analysis, RNAs were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred onto nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schüll), and hybridized with cDNA probes using Express hybridization solution (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA probes were made from 3′-ESTs excised from cloning vectors, 1) TβRII 3′-EST (accession number AA487034, restriction enzymes EcoR-I/Xho-1) and 2) metallothionein I-H (H77597, EcoR-I/Pac-1). The excised 3′-ESTs were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the Random Primer labeling system (Invitrogen), and purified with a silica gel column (Qiagen).RESULTSTGF-β Induces Motility of MCF-10A/HER2 Cells—We have examined the effects of HER2 overexpression on the response of human mammary epithelial cells to TGF-β. MCF-10A nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells were stably transduced with a retroviral vector encoding Myc-tagged HER2 (Fig. 1A). By Western analysis with HER2 and c-Myc antibodies, protooncogene expression was confirmed in the transduced cells. Both HER3 and a 185-kDa phosphotyrosine band were identified in HER2 immunoprecipitates from the HER2-transfected cells, indicating that HER2 was constitutively phosphorylated and associated with HER3 (erbB3) in the absence of exogenous ligands (Fig. 1B). Treatment with recombinant TGF-β (for 24 h) increased the fraction of cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle in MCF-10A/HER2 (34 → 47%) and control cells (32 → 49%) with a simultaneous reduction in the S-phase fraction and a 50% reduction in cell number after 6 days (Figs. 1, C and D).We next examined the effect of TGF-β on the motility of HER2-overexpressing cells in wound closure and transwell motility assays. After 18 h, MCF-10A/HER2 cells migrated into the wounded area but did not close the wound, whereas in MCF-10A/vector cells the wound remained completely open. Similar results were observed in cells plated in transwells (Fig. 2, A and B, first column). The addition of TGF-β resulted in complete wound closure by MCF-10A/HER2 cells but had no effect on motility of control cells (Fig. 2, A and B, second column). TGF-β-induced motility was blocked by the addition of a saturating concentration of the HER2 blocking antibody Herceptin (Fig. 2, A and B), thus implying that the effect of TGF-β was HER2-specific. The EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 (Iressa), which has been shown to block phosphorylation of HER2 (36Moulder S.L. Yakes F.M. Muthuswamy S.K. Bianco R. Simpson J.F. Arteaga C.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8887-8895Google Scholar), also inhibited TGF-β-induced wound closure completely (data not shown).Fig. 2TGF-β induces motility of MCF-10A/HER2 cells. A, confluent cell monolayers in serum-free medium were wounded with a pipette tip. After wounding, TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) and/or Herceptin (10 μg/ml) were added as indicated, and wound closure was monitored by microscopy at 18 h. Scale bar, 100 μm. B, a single cell suspension of 2 × 105 cells in serum-free medium was seeded onto transwell filters (6-mm diameter, 5-μm pores) in 12-well plates and allowed to migrate. After 18 h, cells on the underside of the filters were fixed, stained, and counted. Scale bar, 100 μm. The results are represented quantitatively in the bar graph below. Each data point represents the mean ± S.D. of three wells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Expression of ALK5T204D Enhances Motility in MCF-10A/HER2 Cells—To determine whether the motility effect was specific to activated TGF-β receptors, we induced TGF-β signaling in both cell types by expressing an HA-tagged adenovirus encoding a constitutively active mutant of TβRI (ALK5T204D). Mutation of threonine 204 in ALK5 to aspartic acid leads to constitutive activation of the type I receptor serine/threonine kinase, allowing it to signal in the absence of added ligand or TβRII (37Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Google Scholar). Cells infected with a β-galactosidase adenovirus at the same multiplicity of infection were used as controls. The efficiency of transduction was >90% as evaluated by in situ staining for β-galactosidase activity 48 h after infection (data not shown). Expression of ALK5T204D was confirmed by HA immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3A). The β-galactosidase-transduced MCF-10A/HER2 cells exhibited slightly higher basal motility than the non-motile MCF-10A/vector cells. However, ALK5T204D induced wound closure and transwell migration in HER2-overexpressing but not in control cells (Fig. 3, B and C).Fig. 3Expression of ALK5T204D enhances motility in MCF-10A/HER2 cells. A, MCF-10A/vector and MCF-10A/HER2 cells were infected with adenoviruses encoding β-galactosidase or an HA-tagged constitutively active mutant of TβRI (ALK5T204D) at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell for 1 h. Forty-eight h after infection, HER2 and ALK5 expression was verified by immunoblot (IB) utilizing HER2, HA, TβRI, and actin antibodies. B, confluent monolayers of adenovirus-infected cells were wounded with a pipette tip as indicated in Fig. 2A, and wound closure was monitored 18 h later. Scale bar, 100 μm. C, adenovirus-transduced cells were plated onto transwell filters as indicated in Fig. 2B. Cell migration to the underside of the transwell filters was assessed 18 h after plating.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)TGF-β-induced Motility of HER2-overexpressing MCF-10A Cells Requires Multiple Signaling Pathways—TGF-β-induced cell motility in HER2 cells was blocked by the addition of mitomycin C, a compound that inhibits DNA synthesis (data not shown). Therefore, we examined if TGF-β stimulated DNA synthesis in the wounded monolayers as measured by BrdUrd incorporation. Interestingly, the addition of TGF-β clearly stimulated BrdUrd incorporation in MCF-10A/HER2 but not MCF-10A/vector cells, but this was limited to cells in the edge of the wound (Fig. 4A). Because TGF-β can activate non-Smad signaling pathways or induce molecules associated with cell motility (32Dumont N. Bakin A.V. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3275-3285Google Scholar, 34Bakin A.V. Rinehart C. Tomlinson A.K. Arteaga C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3193-3206Google Scholar), we examined for evidence of activated (phosphorylated) Akt, ERK and p38 MAPK as well as increased integrin β1 by immunocytochemistry focusing on cells in the leading edge of the wound. Using commercially available (phospho-specific) antibodies, we were unable to detect the above-mentioned molecules. However, TGF-β-induced wound closure was completely blocked in the presence of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, the MEK1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) inhibitor U0126, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, and the CD29 integrin β1 blocking antibody (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4TGF-β-induced motility of HER2-overexpressing MCF-10A cells requires multiple signaling pathways.

https://openalex.org/W1994346219,"Lantibiotics are lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotics. Nisin, encoded by nisA, is a pentacyclic lantibiotic produced by some Lactococcus lactis strains. Its thioether rings are posttranslationally introduced by a membrane-bound enzyme complex. This complex is composed of three enzymes: NisB, which dehydrates serines and threonines; NisC, which couples these dehydrated residues to cysteines, thus forming thioether rings; and the transporter NisT. We followed the activity of various combinations of the nisin enzymes by measuring export of secreted peptides using antibodies against the leader peptide and mass spectroscopy for detection. L. lactis expressing the nisABTC genes efficiently produced fully posttranslationally modified prenisin. Strikingly, L. lactis expressing the nisBT genes could produce dehydrated prenisin without thioether rings and a dehydrated form of a non-lantibiotic peptide. In the absence of the biosynthetic NisBC enzymes, the NisT transporter was capable of excreting unmodified prenisin and fusions of the leader peptide with non-lantibiotic peptides. Our data show that NisT specifies a broad spectrum (poly)peptide transporter that can function either in conjunction with or independently from the biosynthetic genes. NisT secretes both unmodified and partially or fully posttranslationally modified forms of prenisin and non-lantibiotic peptides. These results open the way for efficient production of a wide range of peptides with increased stability or novel bioactivities. Lantibiotics are lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotics.

These results open the way for efficient production of a wide range of peptides with increased stability or novel bioactivities. A wide spectrum of biological functions, such as hormone, growth factor, enzyme inhibitor, antigen, antibiotic, and ionophore, can be found among peptides. Cyclization of peptides has been shown to be a valuable method to obtain biostable analogs. Furthermore, by conformational constraints, enhanced or modulated receptor interaction can be obtained (1Li P. Roller P.P. Curr. Top. Med.

Thioether rings can contribute to enhanced peptide stability, enhanced resistance against proteolytic degradation (3Bierbaum G. Szekat C. Joste M. Heidrich C. Kempter C. Jung G. Sahl H.-G. Appl.

Lantibiotics are bacterial peptides with intramolecular thioether bridges (5Bierbaum G. Kelly J.W. Barton D. Nakanishi K. Meth-Cohn O. Amino Acids, Peptides, Porphyrins, Alkaloids. 4. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1999: 275-301Google Scholar). They owe their name to their antibiotic activities and the presence of lanthionine residues. Lanthionines are thioether-containing amino acids. A variety of activities have been demonstrated for lantibiotics, e.g. the autoinduction of lantibiotic synthesis (6Kuipers O.P.

(Tokyo). 1983; 36: 1295-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These activities all depend on the presence of thioether rings. By controlling the lanthionine-synthesizing enzyme complex, one might envisage the possibility of introducing thioether rings at any peptide position. However, at present, only one new thioether ring has been synthesized in a lantibiotic (3Bierbaum G. Szekat C. Joste M. Heidrich C. Kempter C. Jung G. Sahl H.-G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 385-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most interestingly, in vitro activity of the lanthionine-synthesizing enzyme LctM has recently been demonstrated (17Xie L. Miller L.M. Chatterjee C. Averin O. Kelleher N.L. van der Donk W.A. Science. 2004; 303: 679-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The best known lantibiotic is nisin, which is produced by some Lactococcus lactis strains. Nisin is widely applied as a food preservative (18Delves-Broughton J. Blackburn P. Evans R.E. Hugenholz J. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1996; 69: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) because of its antimicrobial activity. It displays a variety of antibiotic activities against many Gram-positive bacteria (7Sahl H.-G. Jack R.W. Bierbaum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 827-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 19Van Kraay C. de Vos W.M. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. Nat. Prod.

Science. 1999; 286: 2245-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) found that nisin interacts with lipid II of the target cell and, already at very low concentrations, this complex permeabilizes the membranes for small ions and solutes. Nisin is composed of 4 methyllanthionines, 1 lanthionine, 2 dehydroalanines, 1 dehydrobutyrine, and 26 unmodified amino acids (20Gross E. Morrell J.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 4634-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 21Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). At position 33, mostly a dehydroalanine is present, but in some cases, an unmodified serine can be found (22Karakas S.A. Narbad A. Horn N. Dodd H.M. Parr A.J. Colquhoun I. Gasson M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The above-mentioned uncommon residues are posttranslationally produced by intracellular membrane-associated enzyme complexes (23Siegers K. Heinzman S. Entian K.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12294-12301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Kiesau P. Eikmans U. Gutowsky-Eckel Z. Weber S. Hammelmann M. Entian K.-D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1475-1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme NisB dehydrates serines and threonines; NisC is responsible for thioether bridge formation by coupling the dehydro residues to cysteines, and NisT exports fully modified prenisin. The extracellular serine protease NisP cleaves off the N-terminal 22–23 amino acid leader peptide (with or without initiating methionine), whereupon the active nisin is released (Fig. 1). Here we show that the nisin-precursor transporter NisT, in different combinations with NisB and NisC, is able to transport a wide variety of modified and unmodified peptides. This now opens the way to the biotechnological production of modified peptides with novel bioactivities and improved stability. Moreover, we show that the processing enzyme, NisP, requires lanthionine formation of the propeptide for proper functioning. Leader Peptide—A synthetic leader peptide without initiating methionine was purchased from Synpep, Dublin, CA. Bacterially produced leader peptide was purified by binding to Teflon beads, a C18 column, and elution with an acetonitrile gradient. Cleavage of leader peptide from fully modified prenisin resulted from a 15-min incubation at 37 °C with 1 mg/ml trypsin. Anti-leader Peptide Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against the peptide H2N-STKDFNLDLVSVSKKDC-CONH2 coupled via the cysteine to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Samples for Western blotting were prepared as follows. Ten ml (20 ml for samples from cells with pLP1vp and pLP1ang) of bacterial culture supernatant was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, kept on ice for 2 h, pelleted by centrifugation at 18,514 × g during 30 min at 4 °C, washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid and with acetone, and vacuum-dried. Pellets were dissolved in 50 μl (for TP9703, NZ9700, and PA1001 containing pBMDL5) or 20 μl of sample buffer and applied on a gel. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—Strains and plasmids are listed in Table I. L. lactis strains PA1001 and TP9703 were prepared from NZ9000 and NZ9700, respectively, using the pOri gene replacement system (29Leenhouts K. Buist G. Bolhuis A. ten Berge A. Kiel J. Miereau I.

DNA amplification was carried out using Expand high fidelity polymerase (Roche Applied Science) or Pfu polymerase (Invitrogen), in the case of insertion or deletion via round-PCR. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Roche Applied Science kit. DNA was restricted using restriction enzymes from New England BioLabs Inc. Ligation was carried out with T4 DNA ligase (Roche Applied Science). DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gel using the Zymoclean gel DNA recovery kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA) or from a PCR mix by using the Roche Applied Science PCR purification kit. For intermediate cloning steps, pGEM-T (Promega) was used. Transformation of Escherichia coli (E. coli DB3.1 (ccdB mutant); E. coli DH5α and E. coli TOP10, all obtained from Invitrogen) was carried out using established procedures (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Electrotransformation of L. lactis was carried out as described previously (31Holo H. Nes I.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 47: 195-199PubMed Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Nucleotide sequence analyses were performed by BaseClear (Leiden, The Netherlands). Culturing—L. lactis was grown in M17 broth (32Terzaghi B.E. Sandine W.E. Appl. Microbiol. 1975; 29: 807-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.5% glucose (MG17) with or without chloramphenicol (5 μg/ml) and/or erythromycin (5 μg/ml). E. coli was cultured in trypton-yeast medium with or without ampicillin (100 μg/ml) or erythromycin (100 μg/ml). Preceding mass spectrometry, cells were cultured, and samples were prepared as follows. Overnight cultures of L. lactis grown in MG17 broth were diluted 1/100. At an optical density at 660 nm of 0.4, cells were centrifuged, and the medium was replaced by minimal medium (33Jensen P.R. Hammer K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 4363-4366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with or without 1/1000 volume of filtered (0.4 μm) overnight L. lactis NZ9700 culture medium containing nisin. Incubation was continued for 4 h or overnight, after which mass spectrometry samples were prepared. In the case of cells containing pNGnisBT, 50 ml of medium was subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation prior to further analysis. Growth inhibition experiments were performed as described previously (34Nissen-Meyer J. Holo H. Håverstein L.S. Sletten K. Nes I.F. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5686-5692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but in the absence of Tween. Mass Spectrometry—Samples were obtained by ZipTip purification (C18 ZipTip, Millipore). ZipTips were wetted and equilibrated with 50% acetonitrile followed by demineralized water. Then peptides were bound and washed with demineralized water, eluted with a solution of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with 30 or 50% acetonitrile, vacuum-dried, and stored at -20 °C until analysis. The dried ZipTip eluent was resuspended in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and 1 μl was applied to the target. Subsequently, 1 μl of matrix (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid completely dissolved by mildly heating and vortexing in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) was added to the target and allowed to dry. Mass spectra were recorded with a Bruker Biflex III MALDI-time-of-flight mass spectrometer. To maintain high sensitivity, an external calibration was applied. Ethanethiol treatment (35Novak J. Kirk M. Caufield P.W. Barnes S. Morrison K. Baker J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 358-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was applied to confirm posttranslational modification. Measurement of Leader Peptidase Specificity—NisP-mediated cleavage of peptides was measured by MALDI-TOF 1The abbreviations used are: MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry. MS. Log phase L. lactis strains were induced during 4 h or overnight. In the indicated cases, NisP-mediated cleavage was measured after pH-induced ring closure. Ring closure in dehydrated prenisin was achieved by a 1-h incubation at pH 8.0, which was followed by readjustment of the pH to 4.3. Treatment of peptide-containing supernatant with cells of NZ9000 containing pNGnisTP was performed during 4 h followed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Induction Assay—The presence of nisin was also tested using the sensitive GusA assay (6Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. de Ruyter P.G.G.A. Luesink E.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27299-27304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) that monitors the capacity of nisin to induce the nisin promoter. Detection of the Nisin Leader Peptide—We first investigated whether the nisin leader peptide would remain present in the culture medium of a nisin-producing L. lactis NZ9700 strain. Peptides isolated from the supernatant of this strain reacted with anti-leader peptide antibodies (Fig. 2, lane 3). A Coomassie-stained gel of a C18 column elution fraction showed the presence of peptide (Fig. 3A) with a mass of 2350.9 Da (MALDI-TOF MS). An identical peptide (Fig. 3B) was observed when ZipTip-treated supernatant from a nisin-producing L. lactis NZ9700 strain, grown overnight in minimal medium (33Jensen P.R. Hammer K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 4363-4366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was analyzed via mass spectrometry. This mass corresponds to the nisin leader peptide without the initiating methionine. In addition, peaks with masses corresponding to the nisin leader peptide with the initiating methionine (2482.2 Da) and nisin (3354.2 Da) were detected (Fig. 3B). In control incubations with L. lactis strain NZ9000, which does not produce nisin, no peaks were observed. A synthetic leader peptide of residues 2–23 gave a mass peak identical to the peak we assigned to the cleaved leader peptide without the initiating methionine. These data for the first time demonstrated the presence of intact nisin leader peptide in the culture medium following secretion and processing.Fig. 3Isolation of nisin leader peptide from culture medium.A, leader peptide isolated from L. lactis NZ9700 culture medium by binding to Teflon beads and a C18 column was subjected to gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie. B, detection of the nisin leader peptide by MALDI-TOF MS. The supernatant of overnight L. lactis NZ9700 grown on minimal medium was ZipTip-treated followed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Expected average masses (M+H+) are: for the nisin leader peptide residues 2–23, 2352.6 Da; for the nisin leader peptide residues 1–23, 2483.8 Da; for nisin, 3355.2 Da. The experiment shown is a typical result that was repeated more than 10 times with identical results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Thioether Ring Formation by NisBTC—To investigate whether NisBTC are sufficient for thioether ring formation, we cloned the nisABTC genes. Both uninduced (Fig. 2, lane 13) and induced PA1001 (Fig. 2, lane 14) containing pBMDL5 produced prenisin. Apparently, when no inducing nisin was added, some transcription still occurred; this has also been reported previously for wild-type nisin producers (6Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. de Ruyter P.G.G.A. Luesink E.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27299-27304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we analyzed the prenisin peptides. The uninduced strain PA1001 containing pBMDL5 produced two peptides with masses corresponding to dehydrated prenisin or fully modified prenisin with and without the initiating methionine (5817.4 and 5686.5 Da) and a third peptide corresponding to unmodified prenisin (5833.9 Da). Similar peptide masses were observed after the induction of PA1001 containing pBMDL5 (Table II), but the mass peak of dehydrated or fully modified prenisin (5688.9 Da) was more pronounced.Table IIModification and export of peptides in L. lactis Cells were induced and grown 4 h (NZ9000 containing pNGnisT and pNGang, NZ9000 containing pNGnisT and pLP1vp) or overnight in minimal medium followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and/or direct ZipTip treatment of the supernatant and MALDI-TOF MS.

Uninduced cells showed a much lower activity. In addition, trypsin-treated culture medium of uninduced and nisin-induced PA1001 cells containing pBMDL5 gained in induction capacity as measured with the GusA assay (6Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. de Ruyter P.G.G.A. Luesink E.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27299-27304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The production of fully modified prenisin by PA1001 containing pBMDL5 was confirmed by overlaying agar plate cells with NZ9000 (Fig. 4A) and with NZ9000 containing pNGnisTP (Fig. 4B). As expected, NZ9700 (position 2) produced clear halos with both overlays, whereas PA1001 (position 1) did not form a halo. By contrast, PA1001 containing pBMDL5 (position 3) and TP9703 (position 4) only produced halos when overlaid with NZ9000 containing pNGnisTP (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the lower activity of trypsin-treated TP9703 supernatant, the halos produced by TP9703 were much smaller than those of PA1001 cells containing pBMDL5. These data demonstrate that both induced, and to a lesser extent, uninduced PA1001 cells containing pBMDL5 produce fully modified prenisin, thus showing that the NisBTC enzymes are sufficient for the thioether ring formation. Export of Dehydrated Prenisin via NisBT—Next, we investigated the functionality of NisBT in the absence of NisC. Strikingly, NZ9000 cells containing pBMDL8B produced prenisin (Fig. 2, lane 12). Mass spectrometry analysis of the supernatant of these cells with plasmid-encoded NisABT (the nisA gene of this construct having two leader peptide mutations, S -6 P and P -2 L) demonstrated the production of dehydrated prenisin (5711.2 Da) and unmodified prenisin (5857.0 Da) (Table II). This shows that NisBT can act independently of NisC and also demonstrates that the NisT transport activity is not strictly coupled to full posttranslational modification of prenisin. Modification and Transport of a Non-lantibiotic Peptide—To investigate whether fusions of the leader with a non-lantibiotic peptide could be modified by NisB and transported by NisT, peptide production by NZ9000 containing pNGnisBT and pLP1ang, encoding a fusion of the leader peptide with NRSY-ICP, was investigated. Both unmodified (3317.9 and 3186.5 Da) and dehydrated fusions of leader peptide with angiotensin-(1–7) (3302.9 and 3169.2 Da), with and without methionine 1, were observed (Table II). To confirm the observed dehydration, prior to analysis, the peptide samples were treated with ethanethiol, which reacts with dehydro residues. Indeed, after ethanethiol treatment, the peptide with the mass of dehydrated leader angiotensin-(1–7) had disappeared, whereas a peptide corresponding to ethanethiol-modified dehydrated peptide appeared (3235.6 Da). As expected, ethanethiol treatment did not alter the mass of the non-dehydrated peptide (3188.6 Da). These data clearly prove that the fusion of leader peptide with angiotensin-(1–7) was dehydrated and transported by NisBT. NisT Has a Broad Substrate Specificity—We subsequently determined whether NisT, in the absence of NisBC, is capable of transporting various unmodified fusion peptides containing the nisin leader peptide. Experiments were performed with NZ9000 cells containing two plasmids, one coding for NisT and the second for a leader peptide fusion. Export of unmodified prenisin (Fig. 2, lane 11), unmodified prenisin with a C-terminally fused enkephalin peptide (Fig. 2, lane 5), a fusion of the leader peptide with a vasopressin variant (Fig. 2, lane 7), and a fusion of the leader peptide with an angiotensin variant (Fig. 2, lane 9) was measured using anti-leader peptide antibodies. Mass spectra clearly demonstrated export of unmodified prenisin without the initiating methionine (5833.2 Da), of a fusion peptide of unmodified prenisin with a C-terminal enkephalin variant (6403.2 Da), of a fusion of nisin leader peptide with vasopressin (3405.2 Da), and of a fusion peptide of the nisin leader peptide with angiotensin-(1–7) (3186.6 Da) (Table II). Control experiments without pNG-nisT and with strain NZ9743 (26Ra R. Beerthuyzen M.A. de Vos W.M. Saris P.E.J. Kuipers O.P. Microbiology (Reading). 1999; 145: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) containing disrupted nisT showed no detectable levels of secreted peptide in the culture medium. Furthermore, in the cell fraction of induced NZ9743 cells, an antibody-reactive peptide was detected (data not shown). Taken together, the data clearly demonstrate that NisT can act independently of the other lantibiotic enzymes and further show that the substrate specificity of NisT is much wider than only the fully modified prenisin. NisP Is Specific for Thioether Ring-containing Prenisin—We measured which leader peptide-containing peptides could be cleaved by the leader peptidase. The leader peptide could neither be cleaved from the leader peptide-angiotensin fusion nor be cleaved from the unmodified or dehydrated prenisin (Table III). However, after keeping the dehydrated prenisin for 1 h at pH 8.0, the leader peptide could be cleaved off. At pH 8.0, thioether rings can be closed spontaneously (36Okeley N.M. Zhu Y. van der Donk W.A. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 3603-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 37Burrage S. Raynham T. Williams G. Essex J.W. Allen C. Carno M. Swali V. Bradley M. Chem. Eur. J. 2000; 6: 1455-1466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), after which the peptide apparently had become substrate for the leader peptidase. The pH 8.0- and NisP-treated dehydrated prenisin had, however, no antimicrobial activity (data not shown), which indicates that no fully modified prenisin had been formed. Fully modified prenisin itself was also cleaved by the leader peptidase, and a control experiment showed that, in the absence of leader peptidase, the pH 8.0 treatment alone did not liberate the leader peptide (Table III).Table IIIThe leader peptidase is specific for thioether ring containing prenisin Cleavage of peptides by NisP was measured by MALDI-TOF MS.

https://openalex.org/W2046541342,"Skeletal muscle is involved in the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. We hypothesized that the skeletal muscle produces and secretes bioactive factor(s), similar to adipocytokines secreted by fat tissue. Here, we report the identification of a novel secretory factor, musclin, by signal sequence trap of mouse skeletal muscle cDNAs. Musclin cDNA encoded 130 amino acids, including NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 30-amino acid signal sequence. Musclin protein contained a region homologous to natriuretic peptide family, and KKKR, a putative serine protease cleavage site, similar to the natriuretic peptide family. Full-length musclin protein and KKKR-dependent cleaved form were secreted in media of musclin cDNA-transfected mammalian cell cultures. Musclin mRNA was expressed almost exclusively in the skeletal muscle of mice. Musclin mRNA levels in skeletal muscle were markedly low in fasted, increased upon re-feeding, and were low in streptozotocin-treated insulin-deficient mice. Musclin mRNA expression was induced at late stage in the differentiation of C2C12 myocytes. In myocytes, insulin increased, while epinephrine, isoproterenol, and forskolin reduced musclin mRNA, all of which are known to increase the cellular content of cyclic AMP, a counter-regulator to insulin. Pathologically, overexpression of musclin mRNA was noted in the muscles of obese insulin-resistant KKAy mice. Functionally, recombinant musclin significantly attenuated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in myocytes. In conclusion, we identified musclin, a novel skeletal muscle-derived secretory factor. Musclin expression level is tightly regulated by nutritional changes and its physiological role could be linked to glucose metabolism."

Inhibiting the type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) in human and mouse pancreatic β-cells markedly increased apoptosis. This mode of programmed cell death was not associated with robust caspase-3 activation prompting a search for an alternative mechanism. Increased calpain activity and calpain gene expression suggested a role for a calpain-dependent death pathway. Using a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches, we demonstrated that the calpain-10 isoform mediated ryanodine-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis induced by the fatty acid palmitate and by low glucose also required calpain-10.

One of the major factors involves in remodeling process is matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP-13 that has been shown to degrade the native interstitial collagens in several tissues. To study how mechanical strain affects extracellular matrix degradation by MMP-13, a biaxial strain was applied to MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells plated onto a collagen-coated flexible elastic membrane. The MMP-13 protein and mRNA expression were determined by Western blotting and reverse transcriptase-PCR, respectively. The zymographic activities of MMP-13 increased dramatically at 30 min, reached a peak by 2-fold at 1 h, and maintained up to 4 h. Moreover, the MMP-13 and c-fos mRNA expressed at 5 min, increased to 2.8- and 3-fold at 1 h, respectively, and gradually declined thereafter. Cycloheximide and actinomycin D did not inhibit the MMP-13 and c-fos mRNA expression, suggesting that such expression does not require de novo protein synthesis and not change their stabilities. To investigate which of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways involves in the expression of MMP-13, inhibitors such as PD98059, SB203580, and SP600125 were used. However, only PD98059 (an inhibitor of MEK1/2 activation) inhibited MMP-13 and c-fos gene expression; the result was further substantiated by transfecting with the dominant negative mutants of MEK1/2 (MEK K97R) and ERK2.

Although osteoblasts have been implicated only in bone formation, in response to resorption stimulators, they may cease synthesis of collagen and start secreting neutral proteinases such as collagenase (10Chambers T.J.

These collagenases may degrade the unmineralized osteoid layer covering bone surfaces, leading to the exposure of the mineralized matrix to osteoclasts. On the other hand, recent findings by Holliday et al. (13Holliday L.S. Welgus H.G. Fliszar C.J. Veith G.M. Jeffrey J.J. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22053-22058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) suggested that collagenases enable osteoblasts to initiate bone resorption by generating collagen fragments, which in turn activate osteoclasts. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13, one of the collagenase subgroup of MMPs, is a neutral proteinase capable of degrading native fibrillar collagens in the extracellular space (14Nagase H. Woessner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar, 15Visse R. Nagase H. Circ.

It cleaves type I, II, and III collagens at a specific site generating 3/4 N-terminal and 1/4 C-terminal fragments, which rapidly denature in physiologic temperature and become susceptible to degradation by other MMPs such as gelatinases. Furthermore, MMP-13 has been demonstrated to cleave type II collagen more readily than types I and III (16Knauper V. Will H. Lopez-Otin C. Smith B. Atkinson S.J. Stanton H. Hembry R.M. Murphy G. J.

Secreted as proenzyme, it consists of a small propeptide cleaved for activation, a catalytic domain, a linker, and a C-terminal hemopexin-like domain that may be involved in matrix binding and alignment of the catalytic domain at the site of enzymatic cleavage (15Visse R. Nagase H. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (3568) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain in mouse MMP-13 has 97% identity to rat and 93% identity to human (18Freije J.M. Diez-Itza I.

The induction of MMP-13 by growing dermal fibroblasts in three-dimensional type I collagen has been analyzed (19Ravanti L. Heino J. López-Otín C. Kähäri V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2446-2455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The results showed that among the three distinct classes of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the p38 MAPK dominantly activates, whereas p42/p44 MAPK inhibits, the MMP-13 expression. A plausible function of MMP-13 may be involved in situations where rapid and effective remodeling of collagenous ECM is required. Originally identified in human breast carcinoma, MMP-13 was also present with limited amount in normal chondrocytes and osteoblasts (17Mitchell P.G. Magna H.A. Reeves L.M. Lopresti-Morrow L.L.

It plays a significant physiological role during bone morphogenesis as in primary fetal ossification and during remodeling of the mature skeletal tissue (22Gack S. Vallon R. Schmidt J. Grigoriadis A.

Moreover, MMP-13 is also implicated in excessive degradation of collagenous ECM in chronic inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritic cartilage, rheumatoid synovium, chronic ulcer, intestinal ulcerations, and periodontitis and in malignant tumors such as breast carcinomas. Osteoblasts have been shown to respond to mechanical loading of bone tissue by changes in enzyme activity and protein production. It remains unclear whether mechanical loading directly coupled to specific gene expression and protein synthesis without participation of circulating systemic or local regulatory factors. In the present study, we cultured MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts onto collagen-coated elastic membrane with a defined serum-free medium, then imposed mechanical strain in vitro to the adherent cells and later examined the induction of the MMP-13 expression.

In Vitro Equibiaxial Stretch Device—To deliver uniform and isotropic tensile strains to osteoblasts in the absence of shear, we used the equibiaxial stretch device (hereafter called biaxial stretcher), which was modified from the original work of Lee et al. (24Lee A.A. Delhaas T. Waldman L.K. MacKenna D.A. Villarreal F.J. McCulloch A.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1400-C1408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A biaxial stretcher is a cell culture chamber, the lid of which is obtained from a 35-mm cell culture dish in diameter, whereas the bottom, the silicone sheet, is suspended and secured by the screw base cylinder. The middle portion contains three concentric cylinders: an inner indenter ring, a membrane holder, and an outer screw top. The stretcher is passive when an indenter ring is resting on the elastic sheet. The degree of stretch is calibrated by the turns of the screw top, which in turn presses down the indenter ring. Biaxial strain was applied when the indenter ring was pressed against the elastic sheet toward the base (Fig. 1). It has been reported that tensile equibiaxial strains of 3 and 6% yield cell area ratios of 1.06 and 1.12, which are equivalent to the cell area changes produced by 10 and 20% uniaxial strain (25Lee A.A. Delhaas T. McCulloch A.D. Villarreal F.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, we used 8% stretch for the optimal expression of MAPKs (data not shown). There was no significance in release of lactate dehydrogenase in test versus control culture medium and no slippage of the strain cells from the collagen-coated membrane with a prolonged period of time. The assembled stretchers were H2O2 gas-sterilized before use. MC3T3-E1 Osteoblastic Cells—The MC3T3-E1 cells were grown to subconfluence in α-MEM containing 10% FBS before plating to biaxial stretchers. At first, to promote cell attachment, elastic membranes of the biaxial stretcher were coated with a solution of 0.01% type 1 collagen overnight and dried. Then, MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 to the collagen-coated sheet of the stretchers and grown to confluence. After changing to serum-free α-MEM medium for 24 h, quiescent adherent cells were stretched under testing condition. For experimental purposes, the specific inhibitors or blockers were added 1 h prior to stretching. Control cells were treated in an identical fashion as test cells except for stretching. Test and control experiments were carried out simultaneously with the same pool of cells in each experiment to match temperature, CO2 content, and pH of the medium for the stretched and control cells. Zymogram, Western Blot Analysis, and Immunoprecipitation—Unless mentioned otherwise, protein concentrations were determined (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211941) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. In this session, the MMPs secreted into the culture medium by strain cells were collected and analyzed. Moreover, the anti-MMP-13 mAb was used to identify by Western blotting and to immunoprecipitate the MMP-13 molecule in the culture medium. Both fractions of immunoprecipitant and of supernatant were further subjected to zymographic analysis. Briefly, aliquots of the control, test medium, and fractions from immunoprecipitant and supernatant were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 1.25% gelatin. Afterward, the gel was washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS, rinsed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then incubated overnight at room temperature with the developing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, 0.02% thimerosal, 1% Triton X-100). The zymographic activities were revealed by staining with 1% Coomassie Blue and, subsequently, destaining of the gel and were quantified by laser densitometry of the corresponding bands in the linear response range of the gelatin zymogram. RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription (RT), and PCR—The adherent cells were harvested after strained for various times, and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and quantified by optical density. One μg of total RNA was added to a RT reaction in RT buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dNTPs, 0.1 m DTT, 0.5 mg oligo(dT) primer, 200 units of SuperScript II RT and Rnase H. Five μl of cDNA from the RT was added directly to a 50-μl PCR containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dNTP, 2.5 unit of Taq DNA polymerase. The amplification conditions were as follows: 94 °C/1 min, 62 °C/1 min, 72 °C/2 min (for MMP-13); 94 °C/45 s, 60 °C/45 s, 72 °C/2 min (for c-fos); 94 °C/1 min, 63 °C/1 min, 72 °C/1 min (for 18 S), all of which were amplified for 30 cycles. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to span at least one intron to detect any contaminating genomic DNA carried over from the RNA isolation step. Eighteen S ribosomal RNA and c-fos primer sequences have been described previously (Ambion), and MMP-13 primer sequences were derived from the mouse MMP-13 sequence (27Henriet P. Rousseau G.G. Eeckhout Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) as follows: MMP-13, 5′-GGT CCC AAA CGA ACT TAA CTT ACA-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-CCT TGA ACG TCA TCA TCA GGA AGC-3′ (antisense primer), a total of 445 bp. Conditions were established so that PCR was stopped in the linear range, and the reaction products could be accurately quantified and compared. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels. Ethidium bromide staining of the bands corresponding to MMP-13, c-fos, and 18 S ribosomal RNA was photographed and digitized by using a Kodak DC290 Zoom digital camera. Density analysis was performed using the UN-SCAN-IT gel program (Silk Scientific, Inc. Orem, UT). The levels of MMP-13 or c-fos mRNA were normalized to those of 18 S ribosomal RNA to correct for differences in loading and/or transferring. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Western Blot Analysis of MAPKs— Cells in control or in test (by 8% stretch) groups were incubated for various times before subjected to cell lysis as described previously (28Yang C.M. Chien C.S. Hsiao L.D. Pan S.L. Wang C.C. Chiu C.T. Lin C.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1531-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). At the termination of mechanical stimulation, the osteoblastic cells were rapidly washed with ice-cold PBS twice and lysed on ice in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na2VO4, 2.5 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors such as 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to yield the cell extract. Equal amounts of samples were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gel and were then blotted to nitrocellulose membrane. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated at room temperature with 5% bovine serum albumin in TTBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h. The total protein profile and the phosphorylated forms of the MAPKs were identified by Western blotting analysis using anti-phospho-p38, anti-phospho-p42/p44, and anti-phospho-JNK, respectively. Briefly, membranes were incubated first with a 1:1000 diluted solution of specific anti-phospho-MAPK Ab or anti-GAPDH Ab and then with the second antibody (anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin/TTBS, 1:1500 dilution). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by an ECL system. Plasmids and Transfection—The plasmids encoding K52R ERK2 and MEK K97R (dominant negative mutants of ERK2 and MEK1/2) were generously provided by Dr. M. Cobb (Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and by Dr. K. L. Guan (Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Harbor, MI), respectively. All plasmids were prepared by using Qiagen plasmid DNA preparation kits. For transfection, the amount of plasmid (0.7 μg) was kept constant for each experiment. The DNA PLUS-LipofectAMINE reagent complex was prepared according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The adherent MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells grown to 70% confluence were washed once with PBS and then with serum-free α-MEM. Subsequently, cells were transfected and incubated with plasmid in serum-free α-MEM (0.8 ml) and DNA PLUS-LipofectAMINE reagent (0.2 ml) at 37 °C for 5 h and later with α-MEM medium (1 ml) containing 10% FBS overnight. After 24 h of transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and maintained in α-MEM containing 10% FBS for additional 24 h. Before applying 8% stretch, cells were washed once with PBS and incubated with serum-free α-MEM for 24 h. Statistics—Data were presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons of control group with treated groups were carried out using the paired sample t test with p values corrected by the Bonferroni method. Comparisons among three or more groups were made by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnetts' modified t test for post hoc analysis. Significance was accepted at the p < 0.05 level. Mechanical strain generated by physiologic demand may dictate local bony architecture through bone remodeling. MMP-13 has been proposed to participate actively in situations where rapid and effective remodeling of collagenous ECM is required. Hence, it is reasonable to investigate the molecular mechanism leading to the expression of the MMP-13 by applying mechanical strain to osteoblasts. MMP-13 Secretion by MC3T3-E1 Osteoblastic Cells in Response to Mechanical Strain—MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells were plated to the collagen-coated elastic membrane of the stretcher, grown to confluence, conditioned in serum-free α-MEM medium for 24 h, and then subjected to test by 8% stretch. The media were collected at 30 and 45 min and run under SDS-PAGE. The anti-MMP-13 was included for the works of Western blotting to identify MMP-13 (Fig. 2, lane 1) and of immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2, lanes 4–7). Moreover, to detect the activities of the MMP-13, zymogram was incorporated (Fig. 2, lanes 2–7). To identify and reveal the presence of the MMP-13 molecule in the test medium, the large amount of 2 ml of sample medium was pooled, precipitated by trichloroacetic acid, and centrifuged. The pellet was subjected to Western blotting analysis. These results revealed that MMP-13 molecule, present in the test medium, was recognized by anti-MMP-13 mAb (Fig. 2, lane 1) at a molecular mass of 60 kDa as pro-MMP-13 form in agreement with previous reports (29Knauper V. Lopez-Otin C. Smith B. Knight G. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1544-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). To differentiate the activities of the MMP-13 between the control and the test culture media, a small amount (200 μl) of the sample medium was collected and examined under zymography. The results showed that the control medium contained trace amount of the zymographic activity (Fig. 2, lane 2). In contrast, when adherent cells were strained for 30 min, the activity of MMP-13 appeared in the test medium (Fig. 2, lane 3). Taken together, these data indicated that being present in the test medium, the MMP-13 itself matched with the co-migrated zymographic activity at the molecular mass of 60 kDa. To ascertain that the zymographic activity is expressed exactly by MMP-13, the anti-MMP-13 mAb (as in Fig. 2, lane 1) was once again used to immunoprecipitate the molecule in the test medium (as in Fig. 2, lane 3). Both fractions of the pellet and the supernatant were run separately to localize the distribution of the zymographic activities of MMP-13. Only trace amounts of activity showed in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5), whereas the majority of the MMP-13 zymographic activities appeared in the pellet fraction (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 7). Furthermore, the response of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts to strain in vitro appeared to be time-dependent (Fig. 3). The zymogram revealed that the strain-induced activities of MMP-13 increased with time, were dramatically enhanced by 50% at 30 min, reached plateau by 1.8-fold increase at 1 h, and remained up to 4 h. Strain Induces Expression of MMP-13 and c-fos Genes in MC3T3-E1 Osteoblastic Cells—The early appearance of the MMP-13 molecule in the test medium prompted us to examine the time-dependent manner of its gene expression by mechanical induction (Fig. 4A). In parallel, the inductive expression of c-fos gene, known as an immediate early mechanoresponsive gene, was included (Fig. 4B). It was clear that the induction of the MMP-13 and c-fos genes increased dramatically to 2.8- and 3-fold, respectively, within an hour by mechanical strain, tapered gradually afterward, yet was prolonged and maintained up to 2-fold even 4 h later. The inductive profiles of the mRNA level of MMP-13 (Fig. 4) ran in parallel with that of its zymographic activities (Fig. 3). Thus, the results confirmed that the early onset of the induced gene of the enzyme corresponded with its prompt appearance as the protein profile in the test medium. Furthermore, the findings that the inductive profile of the MMP-13 genes matched with that of the c-fos gene suggest that MMP-13 should also be recognized as an immediate early mechanoresponsive molecule. To determine whether the effect of mechanical strain on mRNA expressions of c-fos and MMP-13 were dependent on de novo protein synthesis, adherent cultures of osteoblastic cells were stretched by 8% in the absence or presence of cycloheximide at doses known to inhibit protein synthesis (30Obrig T.G. Culp W.J. McKeehan W.L. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 174-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with cycloheximide alone did not affect the mRNA expressions of the c-fos and MMP-13. Moreover, the same results were produced by treatment with osteoblast stretching alone or in combination with cycloheximide, suggesting that MMP-13 (Fig. 5A) and c-fos (Fig. 5B) gene expression induced by mechanoinduction was a primary response through the activation of pre-existing transcriptional factors and was not dependent on de novo protein synthesis. To determine whether effects of mechanical strain on c-fos and MMP-13 mRNA levels were due to changes in transcription stability, osteoblastic cells were exposed to control or strain for 1 h and then treated with RNA polymerase II inhibitor actinomycin D at 10 μm (31Aktipis S. Panayotatos N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 655: 278-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), in the presence or absence of strain for 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9 h. The half-life of MMP-13 mRNA in transcriptionally arrested osteoblastic cells was 4 h in control and test cultures (Fig. 6A). Slope analysis indicated that control and strain did not change the stability MMP-13 mRNA. Similar findings were obtained by examining the c-fos transcriptional mechanism (Fig. 6B). Involvement of p42/p44 MAPK in Strain-induced MMP-13 Gene Expression in MC3T3-E1 Osteoblastic Cells—Three distinct signaling pathways of MAPKs have been identified. They are p42/p44 MAPK cascade, which preferentially regulates cell growth and differentiation, JNK, p38 MAPK cascades, which function mainly in stress responses like inflammation and apoptosis (32Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). To determine whether mechanical strain stimulated MMP-13 expression through activation of these MAPK cascades, the cells were preincubated with specific MAPK inhibitors such as PD98059 (for MEK1/2, upstream of p42/p44 MAPK), SB203580 (for p38 MAPK), and SP600125 (for JNK), respectively. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, mechanical strain stimulated phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK, p38, and JNK-1 and JNK-2 in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells determined by Western blotting using antiserum reactive with anti-phosphop42/p44-MAPK, p38, JNK-1, and JNK-2 antibodies. The phosphorylation of these MAPKs was inhibited by pretreatment of MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells with respective inhibitors. The membranes were then stripped, and the amounts of GAPDH were determined with the use of an antibody that recognized GAPDH as an indicative of protein loading in each well. There was no significant difference in the amount of GAPDH among these samples. The results showed that the activities of these three MAPKs were all stimulated by the mechanical strain and were abolished by the inclusion of the specific inhibitors. To determine which of the MAPK cascades may mediate the expression of the c-fos and MMP-13 genes induced by mechanical strain, the cells were preincubated with specific MAPK inhibitors. At the mRNA level, the amounts of the expressed c-fos and MMP-13 genes were determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 7, C and D). Only the MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, was able to diminish the expression of both c-fos and MMP"

This established aging model is able to respire by either the standard or the alternative pathway. In the latter pathway, electrons are directly transferred from ubiquinol to the alternative oxidase and thus bypass complexes III and IV. We show that the cytochrome c oxidase pathway is organized according to the mammalian “respirasome” model (Schägger, H., and Pfeiffer, K. (2000) EMBO J. 19, 1777–1783). In contrast, the alternative pathway is composed of distinct supercomplexes of complexes I and III (i.e. I2 and I2III2), which have not been described so far. Enzymatic analysis reveals distinct functional properties of complexes I and III belonging to either cytochrome c oxidase- or alternative oxidase-dependent pathways. By a gentle colorless-native PAGE, almost all of the ATP synthases from mitochondria respiring by either pathway were preserved in the dimeric state.

The inner mitochondrial membrane harbors the four major respiratory complexes (I–IV) of the standard respiratory chain and the F0F1-ATP synthase (complex V) designated as OXPHOS 1The abbreviations used are: OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; AOX, alternative oxidase; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; BN-PAGE, blue-native PAGE; CN-PAGE, colorless-native PAGE; COX, cytochrome c oxidase; cyt, cytochrome; DBQ, decylubiquinone; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.-complexes (oxidative phosphorylation). The OXPHOS-complexes I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), III (ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase), and IV (cytochrome c oxidase, also referred to as COX) transduce the energy of nutritional compounds, ultimately leading to the generation of ATP by the F0F1-ATP synthase. According to the generally accepted “random collision model”, the OXPHOS-complexes are distributed independently from each other in the membrane (1Hackenbrock C.R. Chazotte B. Gupte S.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 331-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In contrast to this textbook view, it was proposed recently that the OXPHOS-complexes of mammals were organized as very large supramolecular structures termed the “respirasome” consisting of two different supercomplexes (I1III2IV4 and III2IV4) as building blocks in a 2:1 ratio (2Schägger H.

This model was based on results by blue-native PAGE (BN-PAGE) after mild solubilization of bovine and human mitochondria with digitonin by which most of complexes I and III, as well as a smaller but significant proportion of complex IV were resolved as specific supercomplexes. As an important functional consequence of the respirasome architecture, a kinetic advantage through “substrate channeling” between the OXPHOS-complexes was suggested (2Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Apart from the standard respiratory chain, plants, some fungi, and protozoa contain alternative respiratory chains utilizing an alternative oxidase (AOX). Recently, in higher plant mitochondria, a stable supercomplex formed by complexes I and III was described. Importantly, the interactions of the plant AOX with other respiratory complexes could not be found (5Eubel H. Jänsch L. Braun H.P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 2003; 133: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Until now, nothing was known about the occurrence of supercomplexes in the branched respiratory chain of fungi possessing complex I. In obligate aerobes like mammals and most fungi, mitochondria produce >90% of cellular ATP and therefore are indispensable to satisfy the cellular energy demands. Impairments of this machinery lead to severe diseases and are thought to be causatively involved in aging. The latter is conceptualized in the “mitochondrial theory of aging” (reviewed in Ref. 6Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7349) Google Scholar). A paradigm of an organism in which mitochondria play an etiological role in aging is the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina. In contrast to almost all of the other fungi, which are capable of infinite growth, all of the examined wild-type strains of P. anserina exhibit a characteristic “senescence syndrome” (7Rizet G. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1953; 237: 838-855Google Scholar). After prolonged vegetative propagation, the growth rate of the culture decreases and the pigmentation of the mycelium changes. Finally, the filamentous “cells” of the mycelium, the hyphae, die at their tips. These features and the fact that a number of mutants were selected in which lifespan is significantly increased led to extensive investigations aimed to understand the molecular basis of aging in this model system (reviewed in Refs. 8Osiewacz H.D. Ageing Res. Rev. 2002; 1: 425-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and 9Osiewacz H.D. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The lifespan of P. anserina is determined by environmental factors (e.g. growth temperature, nutrition) and by both nuclear as well as extranuclear genetic traits. The most significant insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in lifespan control of P. anserina is derived from the characterization of different long-lived mutants. Interestingly, some mutants are characterized by impairments of the standard respiratory chain at complex IV. They respire via an AOX (see above), which circumvents the electron transport to complexes III and IV and directly transfers electrons from ubiquinol to oxygen (reviewed in Refs. 8Osiewacz H.D. Ageing Res. Rev. 2002; 1: 425-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and 9Osiewacz H.D. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that respiration via this pathway leads to a reduction in reactive oxygen species generation (10Dufour E. Boulay J. Rincheval V. Sainsard-Chanet A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4138-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition, in such strains, the mtDNA was found to be stabilized (10Dufour E. Boulay J. Rincheval V. Sainsard-Chanet A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4138-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 11Borghouts C. Kimpel E. Osiewacz H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2004; 3: 200-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the structural, functional, and regulatory features of the AOX pathway are still enigmatic in many aspects (15Joseph-Horne T. Hollomon D.W. Wood P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 179-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 16Affourtit C. Albury M.S. Crichton P.G. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In an attempt to further elucidate the molecular basis of the observed link between respiration and lifespan control in P. anserina, we performed an extensive biochemical study of mitochondrial proteins from wild-type strain s as well as from the COX-deficient longevity mutants ex1 and grisea with emphasis on the characterization of the OXPHOS-complexes. We investigated digitonin-solubilized mitochondria by BN-PAGE as described previously (2Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) but extended our analysis using the more gentle colorless-native (CN)-PAGE that allows the detection of weak protein-protein interactions. We specially focused on the properties of COX and AOX. Here we show that the COX-dependent respiratory machinery in P. anserina is organized according to the respirasome model of the mammalian respiratory chain. Moreover, we demonstrate the dimeric complex I (I2) and the large supercomplex I2III2 as distinct components of the AOX-dependent respiratory machinery. The low yield of supercomplexes associated via complex I-I and complex I-III interactions is improved by CN-PAGE. Enzymatic analysis reveals substantially distinct functional properties of complexes I and III belonging to either COX- or AOX-dependent respiratory pathways. Additionally, as in mammalian and yeast mitochondria (2Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 17Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), ATP synthases appear to exist as dimer V2 because by digitonin-supplemented CN-PAGE analysis almost all of the ATP synthases were isolated in the dimeric state in all of the investigated P. anserina strains. We discuss the general importance of the results presented for the respirasome model of the standard respiratory chain as well as its significance as a molecular basis for lifespan control in this aging model. Strains and Media—The wild-type strain s and the two mutant strains, grisea and ex1, of P. anserina were investigated in this study (13Schulte E. Kück U. Esser K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 211: 342-349Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Esser K. King R.C. Handbook of Genetics. Plenum Press, NY1974: 531-551Google Scholar, 19Prillinger H. Esser K. Mol. Gen.

Genet. 1985; 9: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Juvenile cultures were derived from a mononucleate ascospore incubated on germination medium (2.3 g of ammonium acetate in 500 ml of cornmeal medium (18Esser K. King R.C. Handbook of Genetics. Plenum Press, NY1974: 531-551Google Scholar)) for 2 days at 27 °C in the dark. Subsequently, pieces of the developing mycelium were transferred to an agar plate containing cornmeal medium. After 2 days of incubation at 27 °C in the light, pieces of the mycelium from the growth front were transferred to liquid complete medium for 2–3 days (12Borghouts C. Kerschner S. Osiewacz H.D. Curr. Genet. 2000; 37: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Alternatively, agar plates were stored at 4 °C and later used to generate a liquid culture. Copper supplementation of grisea cultures was carried out by the addition of 250 μm CuSO4 to the autoclaved medium at a temperature of ∼60 °C. Isolation of Mitochondria—All of the isolation steps were performed at 4 °C. Wet mycelium (15 g) was grinded in liquid nitrogen and subsequently suspended in 75 ml of grinding buffer (350 mm mannitol, 30 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.6). Immediately, 0.45 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone and 0.095 g of l-cysteine were added. The cell debris was stirred for 1 h and subsequently centrifuged at 1450 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered through two layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of wash medium (300 mm mannitol, 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2) and homogenized using a glass homogenizer. 10 ml of wash medium were added, and 20 ml of the suspension were layered onto 8 ml of 0.6 m sucrose in a centrifuge tube. Mitochondria were pelleted at 10,800 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of suspension solution (250 mm sucrose, 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.2). Aliquots of mitochondria were stored at -80 °C. Electrophoretic Techniques—Digitonin and Triton X-100 were of high purity grade from Calbiochem Merck Biosciences GmbH, and Roche Diagnostics GmbH, respectively. Mitochondria from P. anserina strains were processed as described (2Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 17Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) using a digitonin/protein ratio of 4 g/g for the first dimension BN-PAGE and CN-PAGE supplemented with Triton X-100 as well as a digitonin/protein ratio of 2 g/g for the first dimension CN-PAGE supplemented with digitonin, respectively. Each lane was loaded with the extract from mitochondria, each containing 150 μg of protein before solubilization. For BN-PAGE, linear 4–13% gradient gels overlaid with a 3.5% stacking gel were used. CN-PAGE was performed according to Schägger et al. (21Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar) with complete omission of Coomassie Blue dye using linear 3–16% gradient gels overlaid with a 3% stacking gel, which were both supplemented with either 0.01% Triton X-100 or 0.01–0.08% digitonin. Strips from the first dimension BN-PAGE or CN-PAGE, respectively, were then excised and used for a second dimension 16.5% SDS-PAGE as described (21Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). The first dimension gels were Coomassie Blue-stained, and second dimension gels were silver-stained, respectively. Second dimension SDS-PAGE revealed the characteristic subunit compositions of the OXPHOS-complexes. Additionally, nine polypeptides (e.g. COX subunits II and V) were excised from second dimension gels, subjected to in-gel trypsinization, and identified by MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystems Voyager DE PRO) as described (22Rexroth S. Meyer zu Tittingdorf J.M.W. Krause F. Dencher N.A. Seelert H. Electrophoresis. 2003; 24: 2814-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular masses of the OXPHOS-complexes and their supercomplexes were calibrated by digitonin-solubilized bovine heart mitochondria (2Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) applied to the same first dimension BN gel. The supercomplexes a–c (I1III2IV0–2), I2III2, as well as dimeric ATP synthase and dimeric complex I were assigned according to their subunit compositions and apparent molecular masses. The stoichiometry of the supercomplex I2III2 was additionally verified by densitometric comparison of staining intensities of its subunits with those of supercomplex a (I1III2) from the same second dimension gel performed with three independent gels. An attempt was not made to determine the stoichiometries of supercomplexes resolved by CN-PAGE that were designated as IxIIIyIVz and IxIIIy, respectively. Quantification of gel bands was performed using a calibrated densitometer (Bio-Rad GS-800). Enzymatic Analyses—The activities of respiratory chain complexes were monitored as described previously (2Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) with some modifications. P. anserina mitochondrial membranes (2 mg of protein/ml) suspended in 150 mm NaCl and 75 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, were supplemented with digitonin to adjust variable digitonin/protein ratios. After 10 min of incubation on ice, all of the catalytic activities were measured at 22 °C using 150 mm NaCl and 75 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, as the test buffer. Cyanide and salicylhydroxamic acid (each 2 mm of final concentration) were added to the buffer. NADH:ubiquinol reductase (complex I) was measured by the decylquinazolinamine-sensitive oxidation of NADH (200 μm, 340–400 nm, and ϵ340–400 nm = 6.3 mmcm-1) using decylubiquinone (DBQ, 75 μm) as electron acceptor. Ubiquinol:cytochrome c reductase (complex III) was measured by the antimycin-sensitive reduction of cytochrome c (70 μm horse heart cytochrome c; 550–540 nm, ϵ550–540 nm = 19.1 mm-1 cm-1). Decylubichinol (75 μm) was used as the substrate for complex III. NADH:cytochrome c reductase (complex I+III) was measured by the antimycin- and decylquinazolinamine-sensitive reduction of cytochrome c (as above) using 200 μm NADH as electron donor. The catalytic activity was determined with or without added quinone (0–50 μm DBQ). The NADH dehydrogenase activity of complex I was probed by in-gel formazan precipitation using a modified protocol described by Kuonen et al. (23Kuonen D. Roberts P.J. Cottingham I.R. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 153: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and Grandier-Vazielle and Guerin (24Grandier-Vazeille X. Guerin M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 242: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the cytochrome c oxidase activity of complex IV by precipitation of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine oxides and indamine polymers using a slightly modified protocol of Zerbetto et al. (25Zerbetto E. Vergani L. Dabbeni-Sala F. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2059-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Immediately after BN-PAGE, gel strips were incubated for 1 h at room temperature either in 100 mm Tris, 768 mm glycine, 0.04% (w/v) 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride, and 0.1 mm β-NADH, pH 7.4, or in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 mg/ml 3,3′-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride, 0.5 mg/ml cytochrome c (horse heart), catalase (20 units/ml), and 75 mg/ml sucrose, pH 7.4, respectively. Subsequently, the gels were fixed in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 15 min. Mammalian-like OXPHOS-supercomplexes in Mitochondria of P. anserina—To test whether a respirasome organization was found in mitochondria of P. anserina, we performed BN-PAGE/second dimension SDS-PAGE of digitonin-solubilized mitochondria (digitonin/protein = 4 g/g) from juvenile cultures of wild-type strain s of P. anserina. Second dimension SDS-PAGE resolved the characteristic subunit composition of the native OXPHOS-complexes separated by BN-PAGE (Fig. 1A). Overall, the pattern of OXPHOS-complexes and their supercomplexes of wild-type mitochondria was similar to that of mammalian mitochondria (2Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 3Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37861-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schägger H. IUBMB Life. 2001; 2: 119-128Google Scholar). Most of the complex I and complex III were found assembled together in three supercomplexes, each with a single copy of monomeric complex I and dimeric complex III as well as 0–2 copies of complex IV (Fig. 1A, a–c, and Table I). The most abundant supercomplex with an apparent molecular mass of ∼1,700 kDa was b (I1III2IV1). As in the case of mammalian mitochondria, the stability of supercomplexes was hardly affected by the digitonin/protein ratio at least until 8 g/g (not shown). Importantly, the separated supercomplexes a–c were enzymatically active as demonstrated by in-gel staining of NADH-dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase activities according to their content of complex I and complex IV (Fig. 1C). A specific staining of complex III activity is not available (25Zerbetto E. Vergani L. Dabbeni-Sala F. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2059-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Free complex III known to exist as dimer III2 (calculated molecular mass = ∼450 kDa) had an unusual electrophoretic mobility and migrated only slightly faster than monomeric ATP synthase (complex V) at nearly the same position in the gel with an apparent molecular mass of ∼600 kDa. This was obviously due to boundary lipids, which play a pivotal role for stability and respiratory function of complex III (26Schägger H. Hagen T. Roth B. Brandt U. Link T.A. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Lange C. Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6591-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Indeed, using dodecylmaltoside or Triton X-100 (in 1 m 6-aminocaproic acid, 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0) solubilized mitochondrial membranes from all of the strains used in this study, we could not identify substantial amounts of assembled complex III. 2F. Krause, C. Q. Scheckhuber, A. Werner, S. Rexroth, N. H. Reifschneider, N. A. Dencher, and H. D. Osiewacz, unpublished result. This observation suggests that in these cases complex III most probably dissociated into its subunits due to a detergent-induced loss of critical bound lipids. A heavy complex (Fig. 1A, V2) running between supercomplex a (I1III2) and monomeric complex I with the same subunit composition as monomeric ATP synthase was resolved. Its apparent molecular mass of ∼1,250 kDa indicates that this complex represents dimeric ATP synthase. Dimeric ATP synthase populations amount to ∼50% of the total detected ATP synthase. The remainder represents monomeric ATP synthase. This is comparable to the situation in yeast mitochondria (2Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 17Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and is a much larger portion of dimeric ATP synthases than was obtained from bovine heart mitochondria under the same conditions (2Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 3Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. J. Biol.

Werner A. Elthon T. Osiewacz H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Lorin S. Dufour E. Boulay J. Begel O. Marsy S. Sainsard-Chanet A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or senescent wild-type cultures (28Borghouts C. Werner A. Elthon T. Osiewacz H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) grown under standard conditions. To study the composition and supramolecular organization of the AOX-dependent respiratory system in P. anserina by BN-PAGE/second dimension SDS-PAGE, we examined digitonin-solubilized mitochondria (digitonin/protein = 4 g/g) of the COX-deficient mutant ex1, which exclusively respires via AOX because of the lack of a mitochondrially encoded structural gene for COX assembly (13Schulte E. Kück U. Esser K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 211: 342-349Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Frese D. Stahl U. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1992; 65: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As expected, no COX (complex IV) was detected in either free form or in supercomplexes. However, although in this mutant complex III was not engaged as an electron transducer coupled to translocation of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, it was found to be a major protein component (Fig. 1B). In contrast to the cytochrome respiratory system of the wild type in which most of complexes I and III were assembled together in supercomplexes (Fig. 1A), most of complex III was present as a dimer and only a minor part bound to complex I (Table I). Only after solubilizing ex1 mitochondria by ≤1 g of digitonin/g protein, which gave <50% solubilization efficiency, most of the extracted complexes I and III were found as weakly resolved supercomplexes (not shown). Most importantly, besides the supercomplex a (I1III2), there were two supercomplexes not observed in wild-type mitochondria, exhibiting NADH dehydrogenase activity (Fig. 1, B and C). The smaller one with a molecular mass of ∼1,900 kDa had the same subunit composition as monomeric complex I (∼900 kDa) and apparently represents a dimer of complex I. The larger one (I2III2) was composed of the subunits of complexes I and III. Densitometric quantification of the protein subunits in second dimension gels and the apparent mass of ∼2,400 kDa in BN-PAGE indicated that it consisted of each a complex I dimer (∼1,900 kDa) and a complex III dimer (∼600 kDa). Notwithstanding their low abundance, after increasing the digitonin/protein ratio to at least 8 g/g (not shown), all three supercomplexes were found in approximately the same yield. Remarkably, in the ex1 mutant, ATP synthase was found in essentially the same ratio of dimeric to monomeric complexes as in the wild type (Fig. 1, A and B). The supercomplexes I2III2, I2, and a (I1III2) simultaneously occur besides monomeric complex I and dimeric complex III. This finding suggests that most or even all of the monomeric complex I and dimeric complex III as well as the smaller supercomplexes I2 and I1III2 are assembled into the large supercomplex I2III2 or even larger supercomplexes. These are biochemically distinguishable from monomeric complex I and its supercomplexes of the COX respiratory pathway. We tested whether a stable interaction of the AOX with such supramolecular assemblies might exist to facilitate electron transfer from complex I to AOX. However, Western blot analysis of second dimension BN/SDS gels using a monoclonal antibody raised against the AOX of Sauromatum guttatum (31Elthon T.E. Nickels R.L. McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1989; 89: 1311-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed no interactions of complex I and AOX. Instead, two signals at the migration front of first dimension BN-PAGE were detected corresponding to monomeric and possibly dimeric AOX (not shown). Characteristic Supramolecular Organization of COX- and AOX-dependent Respiratory Chains in Different Strains—Mild digitonin solubilization of mitochondrial membranes and subsequent BN-PAGE revealed two distinct interaction patterns of both complexes I and III apparently corresponding to the COX- and AOX-dependent respiration of the wild-type and the COX-deficient mutant ex1, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). To examine whether the supramolecular organization of both respiratory pathways are general characteristics not confined to specific strains, we investigated the nuclear grisea mutant, which respires simultaneously via both pathways. The mutant phenotype of this strain is the result of a loss-of-function mutation in the nuclear gene coding for the copper-dependent transcription factor GRISEA (32Borghouts C. Osiewacz H.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because GRISEA controls the expression of a gene coding for the high affinity copper transporter PaCTR3 (33Borghouts C. Scheckhuber C.Q. Stephan O. Osiewacz H.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1355-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the grisea mutant is characterized by severely reduced intracellular copper levels and, consequently, a significant reduction of the copper-dependent COX. However, the mutant phenotype can be rescued to wild-type characteristics by supplementation of the growth medium with high amounts of copper (28Borghouts C. Werner A. Elthon T. Osiewacz H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34Marbach K. Fernandez-Larrea J. Stahl U. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, copper uptake occurs presumably via a low affinity system and is efficient enough to restore the COX-dependent respiration and all other wild-type specific features. Mitochondrial membranes of two independently grown juvenile cultures (c1, c2) of the grisea mutant as well as a juvenile culture of this mutant grown in medium supplemented with 250 μm CuSO4 were examined.

https://openalex.org/W2133957638,"The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT-I) is a 350-kDa complex of three proteins, Vps23, Vps28, and Vps37. The N-terminal ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant (UEV) domain of Vps23 is required for sorting ubiquitinated proteins into the internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies. UEVs are homologous to E2 ubiquitin ligases but lack the conserved cysteine residue required for catalytic activity. The crystal structure of the yeast Vps23 UEV in a complex with ubiquitin (Ub) shows the detailed interactions made with the bound Ub. Compared with the solution structure of the Tsg101 UEV (the human homologue of Vps23) in the absence of Ub, two loops that are conserved among the ESCRT-I UEVs move toward each other to grip the Ub in a pincer-like grasp. The contacts with the UEV encompass two adjacent patches on the surface of the Ub, one containing several hydrophobic residues, including Ile-8Ub, Ile-44Ub, and Val-70Ub, and the second containing a hydrophilic patch including residues Asn-60Ub, Gln-62Ub, Glu-64Ub. The hydrophobic Ub patch interacting with the Vps23 UEV overlaps the surface of Ub interacting with the Vps27 ubiquitin-interacting motif, suggesting a sequential model for ubiquitinated cargo binding by these proteins. In contrast, the hydrophilic patch encompasses residues uniquely interacting with the ESCRT-I UEV. The structure provides a detailed framework for design of mutants that can specifically affect ESCRT-I-dependent sorting of ubiquitinated cargo without affecting Vps27-mediated delivery of cargo to endosomes. The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT-I) is a 350-kDa complex of three proteins, Vps23, Vps28, and Vps37. The N-terminal ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant (UEV) domain of Vps23 is required for sorting ubiquitinated proteins into the internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies. UEVs are homologous to E2 ubiquitin ligases but lack the conserved cysteine residue required for catalytic activity. The crystal structure of the yeast Vps23 UEV in a complex with ubiquitin (Ub) shows the detailed interactions made with the bound Ub. Compared with the solution structure of the Tsg101 UEV (the human homologue of Vps23) in the absence of Ub, two loops that are conserved among the ESCRT-I UEVs move toward each other to grip the Ub in a pincer-like grasp. The contacts with the UEV encompass two adjacent patches on the surface of the Ub, one containing several hydrophobic residues, including Ile-8Ub, Ile-44Ub, and Val-70Ub, and the second containing a hydrophilic patch including residues Asn-60Ub, Gln-62Ub, Glu-64Ub. The hydrophobic Ub patch interacting with the Vps23 UEV overlaps the surface of Ub interacting with the Vps27 ubiquitin-interacting motif, suggesting a sequential model for ubiquitinated cargo binding by these proteins. In contrast, the hydrophilic patch encompasses residues uniquely interacting with the ESCRT-I UEV. The structure provides a detailed framework for design of mutants that can specifically affect ESCRT-I-dependent sorting of ubiquitinated cargo without affecting Vps27-mediated delivery of cargo to endosomes. Ubiquitination serves as a general mechanism for regulating protein localization and destiny in eukaryotic cells. This mechanism involves conjugation of the 76-residue polypeptide ubiquitin (Ub) 1The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinases; MVB, multivesicular bodies; ESCRT, endosomal sorting complex required for transport; Vps, vacuolar protein sorting; Tsg, tumor susceptibility gene; UEV, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant; MAD, multiple anomalous dispersion; CCD, charge-coupled device; ESRF, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility; SAD, single anomalous dispersion; UIM, ubiquitin-interacting motif; UBC, Ub-conjugating enzyme. to the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues on target proteins. The conjugation occurs by means of a sequential series of thiolester-bound intermediates involving the E1, E2, and E3 enzymes and results in proteasomal, nuclear, and endosomal targeting, depending upon the protein and the nature of the ubiquitination. Whereas proteasomal targeting requires attachment of a chain of at least four ubiquitins linked by isopeptide bonds between the C terminus of one Ub and Lys-48 of the next (1Chau V. Tobias J.W.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar), mono-ubiquitination is sufficient for endosomal targeting. Ubiquitination regulates internalization and/or MVB sorting of many transmembrane proteins, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels, transporters, and permeases (reviewed in Refs. 3Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 4Raiborg C. Rusten T.E. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin.

Ub-mediated endocytosis of RTKs is a principle mechanism for their down-regulation (7Peschard P. Park M. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 519-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Although mono-ubiquitination of RTKs is sufficient for endocytosis, several RTKs are monoubiquitinated at multiple sites (8Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 9Mosesson Y. Shtiegman K. Katz M. Zwang Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21323-21326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), potentially changing the dynamics of endocytosis. For yeast uracil permease, monoubiquitination is sufficient for endocytosis, but Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination seems to stimulate the process (10Galan J.-M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The role of ubiquitination in endocytosis is not limited to initial internalization of proteins from the plasma membrane. Once proteins are localized to endosomal membranes, ubiquitination serves to sort proteins into internal vesicles within the endosomes through inward budding-forming structures known as multivesicular bodies (MVBs). The late endosomes containing MVBs eventually fuse with lysosomes to degrade the internal vesicles and their protein cargo (11Piper R.C. Luzio J.P. Traffic. 2001; 2: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In yeast, sorting into MVBs involves the endosomal-sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT-I). This 350-kDa complex is made up of three proteins, Vps23, Vps28, and Vps37 (12Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 13Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. Traffic. 2000; 1: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologue of Vps23, the tumor susceptibility gene (Tsg101), is also part of a 350-kDa complex that binds Ub and mediates the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins into vesicles (13Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. Traffic. 2000; 1: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 14Bishop N. Woodman P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11735-11742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); however, the mammalian homologue of Vps37 has not yet been identified. Both Vps23 and Tsg101 have an N-terminal domain known as a Ub-conjugating enzyme E2 variant (UEV) (15Ponting C.P. Cai Y.D. Bork P. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Koonin E.V. Abagyan R.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 330-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). UEVs are homologous to E2 ligases but lack a cysteine necessary for catalysis (17Sancho E. Vila M.R. Sanchez-Pulido L. Lozano J.J. Paciucci R. Nadal M. Fox M. Harvey C. Bercovich B. Loukili N. Ciechanover A. Lin S.L. Sanz F. Estivill X. Valencia A. Thomson T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 576-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Compared with the E2 ligases, the UEVs form only a small family of proteins, with only a few representatives in the human genome (Figs. 1 and 2). One of the genes (UEV-1 or Croc-1) encodes several splice variants. The UEVs constitute an ancient protein family with a conserved structure, which is related to but distinct from the E2 ligases (15Ponting C.P. Cai Y.D. Bork P. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Koonin E.V. Abagyan R.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 330-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Villalobo E. Morin L. Moch C. Lescasse R. Hanna M. Xiao W. Baroin-Tourancheau A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The first characterized UEVs, UEV-1A (Croc-1A) and Mms2, form complexes with the E2 ligase Ubc13, which function with the E3 ring proteins TRAF6 and Rad6, respectively, to catalyze the assembly of Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains (19Hofmann R.M.

UEVs can occur as single-domain proteins, as in the case of Mms2, or within multi-domain proteins, such as the human UEV-1B and UEV3, which are fused to fatty-acid hydrolase (22Thomson T.M.

The Tsg101 UEV domain is also able to recognize a PTAP motif from the late domain p6 protein of HIV-1 Gag, and this PTAP binding is necessary for efficient viral budding (25Garrus J.E. von Schwedler U.K. Pornillos O.W.

The interaction between the Tsg101 UEV and the HIV-1 p6 protein seems to recruit the ESCRT complexes to the plasma membrane in a manner that mimics the recruitment of the ESCRT complexes to the early endosomes (reviewed in Rev. 33).

Several modules, such as the UIM, UBA, CUE, and NZF domains, have been characterized recently (34Wang B. Alam S.L. Meyer H.H. Payne M. Stemmler T.L. Davis D.R. Sundquist W.I. J. Biol.

In most cases, the molecular details of the Ub/recognition module interaction have been indirectly inferred from site-specific mutagenesis or from NMR chemical shift changes in the recognition modules elicited by the addition of Ub. Two notable exceptions are the structures of CUE domain/Ub complexes (35Prag G. Misra S. Jones E.A. Ghirlando R. Davies B.A. Horazdovsky B.F. Hurley J.H.

Radhakrishnan I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4597-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We report here the 1.85 Å resolution x-ray crystal structure of the Vps23 UEV domain in a complex with Ub. Plasmids—The sequence encoding the UEV domain of S. cerevisiae Vps23 (residues 1–161) was cloned into vector pOPCH using NdeI-BamHI sites, resulting in a construct with an MAH6 affinity tag immediately preceding residue Met-1. The construct was verified by sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—Selenomethionine-substituted protein was grown in methionine-requiring B834 (DE3) cells in M9 minimal media supplemented with 1 mg/l riboflavin, 1 mg/liter niacinamide, 1 mg/liter pyridoxine monohydrochloride, 1 mg/liter thiamine, 0.4% D(+)-glucose, 2 mm MgSO4, 25 mg/liter FeSO4, 40 mg/liter of each amino acids except methionine, 40 mg/liter seleno-l-methionine, and 0.1 g/liter ampicillin. Cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 = 1.0, then induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated at 16 °C for 12 h. Native protein was expressed in C41(DE3) cells. Cells were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl) and disrupted with a French press. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-affinity column equilibrated with buffer B (Buffer A + 15 mm imidazole) and eluted with an imidazole gradient. Fractions containing Vps23 UEV were pooled and diluted with an equal volume of buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol), loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column, and eluted with a NaCl gradient. Fractions containing Vps23 UEV were pooled, concentrated, and purified by gel filtration on Superdex 75 16/60 equilibrated in buffer D (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). The purified Vps23 UEV domain was concentrated to 78 mg/ml for crystallization screens. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were done in a Beckman Optima XLI analytical ultracentrifuge with Ti-60 rotor using interference and absorbance at 280 and 230 nm, at 10 °C. The Vps23 UEV in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl was loaded into six-sector 12-mm path length cells at three different concentrations: 3, 18, and 470 μm. The samples were spun at 22,000, 28,000 and 35,000 rpm until they reached equilibrium, as judged by the changes in the subsequent scans. Data were analyzed using UltraSpin software (available on the World Wide Web at www.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk). The Vps23 UEV was monomeric at loading concentrations of 3 and 18 μm. At the highest concentration used (470 μm), higher order oligomers of ∼90,000 ± 10,000 were detected. The relative proportion of the oligomeric species decreased as the speed increased, suggesting that it was removed from the equilibrium, possibly by forming large oligomers that sedimented to the bottom of the cell. Crystallization—Solutions for 1200 crystallization conditions were dispensed into reservoirs of 96-well crystallization plates (Corning, NY). Protein (100 nl) and reservoir (100 nl) solutions were added to the plates as sitting drops using a Cartesian robot (Genomics Solutions, Huntingdon, UK) and incubated at 17 °C. The selenomethionine-substituted Vps23 UEV domain was mixed with bovine Ub (Sigma) at a 1:1.1 molar ratio. Optimal crystals were obtained in 22% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.5, and 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4. Crystals used for data collection were grown by hair seeding in hanging drops containing 0.5 μl of protein mixed with 0.5 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals were cryoprotected by incubation over a reservoir containing mother liquor supplemented with 35% polyethylene glycol 8000 for at least 48 h; they were then frozen in a cryostream at 100 K. Data Collection, Phasing, and Model Refinement—Data were collected at 100 K from crystals frozen in a nitrogen gas stream. Multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) data sets were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) beamline ID14–4 using an ADSC charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. Two additional crystals were used for data collection at single wavelengths: one at SRS beamline 14.1 using an ADSC CCD, and another at ESRF BM30A using a Mar CCD. Prior to MAD data collection at ID14–4, a fluorescence spectrum for the crystal was obtained, and three data sets were collected at wavelengths corresponding to the fluorescence peak, inflection, and a high energy remote. Table I lists statistics for data collection. We were unable to locate the Se sites using either FAs derived from all three wavelengths or anomalous differences for the peak wavelength only. However, using a highly redundant, lower resolution single anomalous dispersion (SAD) data set collected at SRS 14.1, eight Se sites were readily located using the program SnB (44Weeks C.M. Miller R.

The 2.6 Å resolution phases from the SRS 14.1 SAD data set were used to locate Se sites for the 2.3 Å resolution ID14–4 MAD data using difference Fourier maps.

The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains one Ub and one UEV domain. The UEV fold consists of a twisted four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet having a meander topology, with four α-helices packed against one face of the sheet (Fig. 3B). The Vps23 UEV domain has greatly extended and twisted S1 and S2 strands (Fig. 3, B and C) to form a feature that has been referred to as the β-hairpin “tongue” (54Pornillos O. Alam S.L. Rich R.L.

Although CAF1 protein belongs to the DEDDh family of RNases, CCR4 appears to be the principle deadenylase of the CCR4-NOT complex. Here, we present evidence that mCAF1 is a processive, 3′–5′-RNase with a preference for poly(A) substrates. Like CCR4, increased length of RNA substrates converted mCAF1 into a processive enzyme. In contrast to two other DEDD family members, PAN2 and PARN, mCAF1 was not activated either by PAB1 or capped RNA substrates. The rate of deadenylation in vitro by yCCR4 and mCAF1 were both strongly influenced by secondary structures present in sequences adjacent to the poly(A) tail, suggesting that the ability of both enzymes to deadenylate might be affected by the context of the mRNA 3′-untranslated region sequences. The ability of mCAF1 to complement a ycaf1 deletion in yeast, however, did not require the RNase function of mCAF1. Importantly, yCAF1 mutations, which have been shown to block its RNase activity in vitro, did not inactivate yCAF1 in vivo, and mRNAs were deadenylated in vivo at nearly the same rate as found for wild type yCAF1.

IntroductionThe control of the rate of mRNA degradation is important to regulating the abundance and translation of mRNA in the cell. In eukaryotes a major pathway of mRNA degradation involves a poly(A)-shortening step followed by removal of the mRNA cap structure and 5′–3′ degradation of the body of the mRNA by the XRN1 exonuclease (1Tucker M. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 571-595Google Scholar). Deadenylation of the poly(A) tail is also a prerequisite to 3′–5′ degradation of the message by the exosome, most notably in control of nonsense-mediated decay (2Cao D. Parker R. Cell. 2003; 113: 533-545Google Scholar, 3Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1405-1413Google Scholar). Other analysis indicates that at least in yeast changes in the rate of mRNA deadenylation contribute to the greatest changes in the rates of mRNA degradation (4Cao D. Parker R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1192-1212Google Scholar). Identification of the functional deadenylases in eukaryotes and characterization of their properties is, therefore, most important to understanding the mRNA degradation process.In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the major cytoplasmic deadenylase is the CCR4-NOT complex (5Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Google Scholar, 6Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Google Scholar, 7Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Google Scholar, 8Daugeron M.C. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Google Scholar). CCR4 is the principle deadenylase within this complex and is a member of the exo III family of nucleases (9Dlakic M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 272-273Google Scholar). PAN2/PAN3 also functions as a deadenylase in yeast and is involved particularly in trimming of the poly(A) tail (5Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Google Scholar, 10Brown C.E. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6548-6559Google Scholar). Both the CCR4-NOT complex and PAN2/PAN3 are evolutionarily conserved (11Draper M.P. Salvadore C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3487-3495Google Scholar, 12Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 809-817Google Scholar) and hCCR4 and hPAN2 display deadenylase activity in vitro (7Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Google Scholar, 14Uchida N. Hoshino S. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1383-1391Google Scholar). Higher eukaryotes also contain the PARN deadenylase, which is a principle component of cell-free extracts capable of efficient poly(A) shortening (15Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Nilsson P. Ehrenberg M. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27923-27929Google Scholar). Both PAN2 and PARN are members of the DEDD family of RNases (16Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Google Scholar, 17Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Google Scholar). PAN2 is specifically activated by the poly(A)-binding protein (PAB1), whereas PARN becomes activated in the presence of the mRNA cap structure (15Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Nilsson P. Ehrenberg M. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27923-27929Google Scholar).A fourth deadenylase CAF1 (also known as POP2) exists within the CCR4-NOT complex. CAF1, which binds CCR4 and links it to the remainder of the CCR4-NOT complex (11Draper M.P. Salvadore C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3487-3495Google Scholar, 18Liu H.Y. Badarinarayana V. Audino D.C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1096-1106Google Scholar), is a member of the DEDDh family of RNases (16Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Google Scholar). In vitro studies have demonstrated that yeast CAF1 can display deadenylase activity (8Daugeron M.C. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Google Scholar, 19Thore S. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Suck D. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1150-1155Google Scholar), but the role of this activity in vivo is unclear. Removal of CAF1 does not impair CCR4 activity in vitro (5Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Google Scholar, 7Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Google Scholar), whereas mutations in the CCR4 putative catalytic residues abolish CCR4-NOT deadenylase function in vivo (6Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Google Scholar, 7Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Google Scholar). Although a caf1 deletion reduces the rate of in vivo poly(A) shortening, overexpression of CCR4 can complement this defect. In contrast, overexpression of CAF1 can not complement a ccr4 defect (5Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Google Scholar, 20Hata H. Mitsui H. Liu H. Bai Y. Denis C.L. Shimizu Y. Sakai A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 571-579Google Scholar). All of these data point toward CCR4 as comprising the major functional deadenylase activity in yeast.Previously (7Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Google Scholar), we have been unable to detect enzymatic activity in yeast CAF1 (yCAF1). 1The abbreviations used are: yCAF1, yeast CAF1; mCAF1, mouse CAF1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; nt, nucleotide. Because the mouse CAF1 (mCAF1) protein displays a greater homology to the canonical RNase motifs in the DEDDh family of proteins (17Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Google Scholar), we decided to characterize the putative deadenylase function of mCAF1. mCAF1 has also been shown previously to partially complement a ycaf1 deletion in yeast (21Shimizu-Yoshida Y. Sasamoto M. Yoshida A. Yoshioka T. Matsumoto A. Sakai A. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1357-1364Google Scholar) and to interact very strongly with yeast CCR4 and NOT1 (11Draper M.P. Salvadore C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3487-3495Google Scholar), 2Y-C. Chiang and C. L. Denis, unpublished observations. suggesting that it can act within a functional CCR4-NOT complex in vivo. To address the role of CAF1 in mRNA degradation, we have purified the mCAF1 to homogeneity and studied its in vitro and in vivo properties.We find that mCAF1 is a robust 3′–5′ processive exonuclease with a preference for poly(A) substrates. mCAF1, unlike PARN, deadenylates both capped and non-capped substrates and unlike PAN2 is inhibited by PAB1. mCAF1 deadenylase activity was found, however, to be 1000–10,000-fold less than that of CCR4. Both mCAF1 and CCR4 deadenylase function was inhibited by stem structures in regions upstream of the poly(A) sequence, suggesting that both proteins may recognize long stretches of RNA (22Viswanathan P. Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14949-14955Google Scholar). Most importantly, mutations in either yCAF1 or mCAF1 that completely abrogate the in vitro function of each protein had no effect on the ability of either protein to functionally complement a yeast caf1 deletion. The yCAF1 deadenylase-deficient protein, moreover, allowed normal deadenylation of mRNA in yeast. These results indicate that CAF1 deadenylase activity is not required for in vivo deadenylation nor for the other important roles of CAF1 in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Strains and Growth Conditions—The following yeast strains were used: A790, MATα aro7 his3 leu2 ura3; A792, isogenic to A790 except caf1::LEU2; EGY188-c1, MATa ura3 LexA-LEU2 trp1 his3 caf1::URA3; and RP1620, MATa cup1::LEU2PM his4-539 ccr4::NEO pan2::URA3 ura3-52 leu2-3,112 trp1. In vivo deadenylation of the GAL1 mRNA was monitored in strain KY803-c1 containing LexA-CAF1 proteins. Following growth on YEP (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone) medium supplemented with 2% galactose, 2% raffinose for 8 min, repression of transcription was initiated with the addition of 4% glucose as described (23Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Google Scholar). Caffeine sensitivity was monitored on medium containing YEP, 8 mm caffeine, 2% agar, and either 2% glucose or 2% galactose as the carbon source.Plasmids—The GST-mCAF1 plasmid was a kind gift from A. Sakai (21Shimizu-Yoshida Y. Sasamoto M. Yoshida A. Yoshioka T. Matsumoto A. Sakai A. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1357-1364Google Scholar). Point mutations (D39A/E41A and Y159A/D160A) of GST-mCAF1 were generated and inserted into the pGEX-KG plasmid. All the plasmids were expressed in the BL21 Escherichia coli strain prior to purification of GST proteins.RNA Substrates—The pT7A38 plasmid containing MFA2 was the kind gift of A. Stevens (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN), and the MFA2 RNA was synthesized as described (24Doktycz M.J. Larimer F.W. Pastrnak M. Stevens A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14614-14621Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA was prepared by Qiagen mini-prep, cut with HindIII, and treated with mung bean nuclease to trim the overhangs. The linearized DNA was transcribed, and synthesis of capped and non-capped MFA2 RNA was prepared with the Maxiscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion) using [α-32P]UTP as a radioactive probe. The transcribed RNA was eluted and quantified as described by the manufacturer of the kit. The commercially synthesized RNA substrates were 25N+20A (22Viswanathan P. Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14949-14955Google Scholar) and 50N+10A containing 50 nucleotides (nt) of the 3′-untranslated regions of COX17, and AHA1 (see Fig. 4B) RNAs with 10 adenine residues at the 3′-end, 50N+10A hybrid COX17 and AHA1 chimera RNAs containing 25 nt of COX17 or AHA1 attached, respectively, to 25 nt of AHA1 and COX17 with 10A residues at their 3′-end (see Fig. 4B), and the 50N+10A COX17 stem that had the sequence as depicted in Fig. 5B.Fig. 5A, a stem structure stalls deadenylase activity of mCAF1 and CCR4. Radiolabeled 50N+10A COX17 and 50N+10A COX17 stem RNAs were incubated with 10 μg of mCAF1 and 300 pg of CCR4 proteins as described in the legend to Fig. 4. The asterisk denotes the 50N+7A product. The concentration of mCAF1 and CCR4 was adjusted so as to give relatively similar rates of reaction with COX17 50N+10A. B, secondary structure of COX17 stem RNA. The predicted secondary structure for COX17 stem RNA was obtained as described in the legend to Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Protein Preparations—GST-mCAF1 protein expression and purification on glutathione-agarose beads were performed as suggested by the manufacturer with slight modifications. The E. coli cells were collected and sonicated with Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2) plus a protease inhibitor mixture. The cleared supernatants were incubated with pre-equilibrated glutathione-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. After extensive washes the GST-mCAF1 proteins were eluted with Tris buffer containing 50 mm glutathione or mCAF1 proteins purified following cleavage with factor-α or thrombin to remove the mCAF1 protein from the bound GST fusions. The Flag-yCCR4 was prepared by anti-Flag beads purification as described previously (7Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Google Scholar).In Vitro Deadenylase Assays—In vitro enzymatic assays with commercially synthesized RNA or in vitro transcribed RNA were conducted with CCR4 as described previously (22Viswanathan P. Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14949-14955Google Scholar) and similarly with mCAF1 except the following buffer was used, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 units of RNase inhibitor, 10% glycerol. The RNA substrates were radiolabeled as indicated (7Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Google Scholar). In vitro enzymatic assays with total RNA extracted from strain RP1620 was conducted as described above, but the products were visualized by Northern analysis following the separation of the RNA in gels containing 8 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide. Radiolabeled pG-specific probe (5Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Google Scholar) that was specific to the poly(G) tract in MFA2pG was used to probe the Northern blot. The mCAF1 kinetic assays were conducted as described for CCR4 (22Viswanathan P. Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14949-14955Google Scholar).RESULTSmCAF1 Is a Deadenylase/3′–5′-Exonuclease—We have shown previously that mammalian CCR4 can function as a deadenylase in vivo (7Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Google Scholar). The strong homology of mammalian CAF1 to that of members of the DEDD RNases suggested that it too may function as a deadenylase. To examine mCAF1 function in vitro we purified it to homogeneity (Fig. 1A, lane 6). Incubation of in vitro synthesized MFA2 RNA containing 38 A residues at its 3′-end (24Doktycz M.J. Larimer F.W. Pastrnak M. Stevens A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14614-14621Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4) indicated that mCAF1 processively removed the poly(A) tail and proceeded as a 3′–5′-exonuclease into the body of the mRNA before stalling at a site 99 nt into the RNA. Point mutations in the conserved putative catalytic residues in the exo I domain of mCAF1, D39A/E40A, and the exo II domain, Y159A/D160A, completely abolished the exonuclease activity (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–12). Similar results with these mutants were obtained with several other substrates and with GST-mCAF1 versions of the mCAF1 variants (data not shown), establishing that the enzymatic activity observed is because of mCAF1. It should be noted in Fig. 1B, lane 4 (identified with an asterisk) that mCAF1 formed a small amount of the MFA2-1 or 0 A product as if it were pausing at this site before proceeding into the body of the mRNA. Using increasing concentrations of mCAF1 (Fig. 1C), the MFA2-1A form becomes more apparent. The 267-nt final product was not the result of an endonucleolytic cleavage as no 99-nt fragment was observed even at increased mCAF1 concentrations (Fig. 1C). The 267-nt stall site occurs just prior to the presence of the first stable stem-loop structure in the MFA2 RNA (24Doktycz M.J. Larimer F.W. Pastrnak M. Stevens A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14614-14621Google Scholar). These results indicate that mCAF1 is a 3′–5′ processive RNase that displays a preference for poly(A) sequences.Fig. 1A, SDS-PAGE analysis of mCAF1 proteins. GST-mCAF1 proteins were analyzed on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. Lanes 1–4, GST and GST-mCAF1 proteins purified following glutathione-agarose chromatography.

The molecular mass of the proteins (in kilodaltons) is indicated on the left. B, mCAF1 displays the 3′–5′-exonuclease activity with in vitro synthesized MFA2 RNA. Deadenylation reactions were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” 5-μl aliquots were removed from a 30-μl reaction volume at the indicated time periods, the RNA products were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel, and the products were visualized with a PhosphorImager. The asterisk denotes the MFA2-1A or -0A product. C, mCAF1 is not an endonuclease. A uniformly labeled MFA2 RNA substrate was incubated in a 30-μl reaction volume containing purified mCAF1 (5 μgas 1X), and aliquots were removed at the indicated time. In vitro synthesized Ambion RNA markers are shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Substrate Specificity of mCAF1—Optimization of the mCAF1 enzyme reaction conditions indicated that mCAF1 functioned well with Mg2+ concentrations from 0.5 to 1 mm and with Na+ concentrations of 50–100 mm. Because the PARN deadenylase, also a member of the DEDD family of proteins, is much more active with capped mRNA substrates, we examined the activity of mCAF1 with capped and uncapped substrates. In vitro synthesized capped and non-capped MFA2 RNAs were degraded by mCAF1 at the same rates (data not shown). As in vitro transcribed RNA may only be partially capped in vitro, we prepared total RNA from yeast cells and analyzed the ability of mCAF1 to degrade the capped MFA2pG mRNA. Uncapped MFA2pG was prepared by hybridizing an oligonucleotide to the start codon of MFA2 followed by digesting with RNase H prior to incubation with mCAF1. This procedure cleaved ∼80 nt of the 5′-end of the RNA including the cap structure. Both capped and non-capped MFA2pG RNAs were incubated with mCAF1, and the products were detected by a probe specific to MFA2pG (Fig. 2). Equal rates of deadenylation were observed for capped and uncapped MFA2pG as well as for the pG-poly(A) fragment that results from decapping and 5′–3′-RNase digestion of the RNA in vivo (23Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Google Scholar). These results indicate that mCAF1 is not a cap-dependent RNase. It should be noted, however, that MFA2pG when present in a complex mixture of total RNA was degraded in a distributive fashion by mCAF1. Degradation beyond the poly(A) tract into the body of the mRNA also did not occur within the time period analyzed, consistent with a preference of mCAF1 for poly(A) substrates. We also determined the effect of PAB1 on mCAF1 activity. PAB1 inhibited the ability of mCAF1 to deadenylate a 25N+20A substrate and did so to the same extent as it inhibited CCR4 activity (data not shown) (6Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Google Scholar).Fig. 2In vitro deadenylation of capped and uncapped in vivo synthesized MFA2pG transcripts. Total yeast mRNA extracted from strain RP1620 was incubated with mCAF1 for the times indicated, and the products were visualized by Northern analysis. Capped mCAF1 refers to untreated RNA and uncapped RNA refers to RNA incubated with a oligonucleotide sequence complementary to the 5′-end of MFA2 and digested with RNase H. The MFA2pG fragment that results following in vivo decapping and 5′–3′-exonuclease activity is indicated at the bottom of the figure. The dT-treatment of capped and uncapped RNA with (dT) oligomer and RNase H was conducted to indicate the size of the deadenylated RNA. Reactions were conducted as described above with 40 μg of total RNA and 60 μg of mCAF1, and 20 μl of aliquots were taken out at the indicated time periods.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine the kinetic parameters of the deadenylase activity of mCAF1, a 25N+20A RNA substrate was used (22Viswanathan P. Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14949-14955Google Scholar). Typical reactions at different substrate concentrations are displayed in Fig. 3. With this short RNA molecule, mCAF1 behaved like a distributive enzyme and paused at the 25N+2A state before proceeding more slowly to the 25N+1A and even more slowly to the 25N+0A. In contrast, CCR4 paused only at 25N+1A with this same substrate (22Viswanathan P. Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14949-14955Google Scholar). We determined the Km for mCAF1 with this substrate to be 24.4 ± 2.6 μm and its kcat to be 0.18 ± 0.02 A/s. The Km value for mCAF1 was 7-fold higher than it was for yeast CCR4 with a similar substrate (22Viswanathan P. Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14949-14955Google Scholar), whereas the kcat value was 1000-fold lower.Fig. 3Deadenylase assays for determining the kinetic parameters of mCAF1. The indicated concentrations of 5′-labeled 25N+20A substrates were incubated with 20 μg of pure mCAF1 under standard assay conditions for the times indicated. The products were separated on a 15% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel and visualized by a PhosphorImager.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Deadenylation by mCAF1 and yCCR4 Is Affected by Secondary Structure in Upstream Non-poly(A) Sequences—We have shown previously (22Viswanathan P. Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14949-14955Google Scholar) that CCR4 prefers substrates of at least 17 nt in length, not necessarily poly(A), suggesting that the non-poly RNA region was capable of being recognized by the enzyme. The importance of non-poly(A) sequences to mCAF1 activity was investigated by examining the poly(A) removal rate of mCAF1 on synthetic 50N+10A RNA fragments modeled on the 3′-untranslated region sequences of COX17 and AHA1 (Fig. 4A). The 50N+10A COX17 RNA was degraded very rapidly (processively within 5 min) to the 50N+2A form and after that to near completion apparently, as no smaller fragments were observed, and the 50N+0A fragment disappeared at 15 and 30 min time intervals. In contrast the AHA1 50N+10A RNA was deadenylated much more slowly and resulted in a 50N+2A product. The rate of formation of the COX17 50N+2A product was estimated to be at least twice that of the rate of formation for the AHA1 50N+2A product (Table I). The difference in the behavior of these two RNAs could be attributed to sequences or secondary structures present on the 50N segment of COX17 and AHA1 RNAs. As shown in Fig. 4B, COX17 displays little secondary structure, whereas AHA1 forms two stem structures one of which occurs just upstream of the 10A tail. The inability of mCAF1 to deadenylate beyond the 50N+2A form of AHA1 suggests that mCAF1 activity is strongly inhibited by stem structures.Table IRelative rates of deadenylation activity with RNA containing different non-poly (A) sequences50N + 10A RNARelative ratemCAF1CCR4COX17100100AHA149 ± 4.569 ± 6.5COX17 ± AHA145 ± 2.550 ± 10AHA1 + COX17112 ± 3.283 ± 12 Open table in a new tab To examine this further we created hybrid 50N+10A substrates that contained either the 5′ 25 nt of COX17 followed by the 3′ 25 nt of AHA1 or inversely the 5′ 25 nt of AHA1 fused to the 3′ 25 nt of COX17. The predicted structures for these two RNA fragments are shown in Fig. 5B. COX17+AHA1 50N+10A RNA was slowly degraded to the 50N+2A form, whereas AHA1+COX17 was rapidly deadenylated to the 50N+2A form and then further degraded to two smaller species marked with asterisks in Fig. 4A. These smaller species correspond to stall sites immediately downstream of the major stem-loop structure of the AHA1+COX17 RNA (Fig. 4B). These results indicate two things about mCAF1 enzyme activity. First, the rate of deadenylation of mCAF1 can be influenced by non-poly(A) sequences that lie within 25 nt of the poly(A) sequences. Second, mCAF1 can function as a strong processive enzyme and stalls within 2–4 nt downstream of a stem structure.We also examined the ability of CCR4 to shorten poly(A) tails with these same RNA substrates. With COX17 RNA CCR4 exhibited rapid and processive deadenylation (Fig. 4C, lanes 1–4), whereas AHA1 was slowly and distributively deadenylated by CCR4 (lanes 5–8). As observed with mCAF1, the 25-nt proximal sequences of AHA1 inhibited CCR4 activity (Fig. 4C, lanes 5–12, relative rates are summarized in Table I), suggesting these proximal sequences are also affecting CCR4 deadenylation of RNAs. In contrast to mCAF1, however, yCCR4 was able to deadenylate AHA1 to the 50N+0A form suggesting it may be less sensitive to the stem structure than mCAF1.The previous results indicate that mCAF1 can not degrade RNA upon encountering a stem structure. For CCR4, however, this conclusion could not be made because the stem structure for AHA1 was in sequences upstream of the poly(A) sequence, and CCR4 does not readily degrade RNA through non-poly(A) sequences. We therefore tested the relative ability of mCAF1 and CCR4 to deadenylate through a stem structure that was embedded within the poly(A) tail. Using a 50N+10A substrate based on the COX17 sequences, we created a stem encompassing 5 of the As in the 10A tail (Fig. 5A). As expected mCAF1 had difficulty deadenylating through the stem structure of COX17 stem RNA and actually paused two and three nucleotides before encountering the stem (Fig. 5B). CCR4 in contrast, although obviously slowed by the stem as compared with COX17 50N+10A, distributively deadenylated through the stem structure with no obvious pause sites (Fig. 5B, lanes 13–16). These data and data described above indicate that both mCAF1 and CCR4 deadenylation function can be influenced by upstream secondary structures not located in the poly(A) region and that mCAF1 has difficulty deadenylating through stem structures.The Deadenylase Function of yCAF1 and mCAF1 Are Not Required in Yeast—Because both yCAF1 (8Daugeron M.C.

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1150-1155Google Scholar) and mCAF1 have been shown to display deadenylase functions in vitro, we determined subsequently whether the activities of yCAF1 and mCAF1 were required in vivo. LexA-yCAF1 proteins were created containing either the S199A/E201A alteration that inactivated yCAF1 deadenylase function in vitro (19Thore S. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Suck D. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1150-1155Google Scholar), which is comparable with the D39A/E41A mutation in mCAF1 that blocked its deadenylase activity (Fig. 1B), or the Y320A/D321A mutation that is comparable with the Y159A/D160A of mCAF1 that inhibited its activity. The expression of LexA-yCAF1 (S199A/E201A) and LexA-yCAF1 (Y320A/D321A) completely complemented the caffeine sensitivity of the ycaf1 deletion (Fig. 6 and data not shown) as did a LexA-yCAF1 fusion carrying all four mutations (data not shown).Fig. 6Deadenylase-deficient yCAF1 and mCAF1 genes complement caffeine-sensitive growth defects of the caf1Δ allele. The yCAF1/mCAF1 carried residues 1–147 of yCAF1 and the full-length version of mCAF1 (1–231) for the right panel, and in the left panel it carried residues 1–181 of yCAF1 and full-length mCAF1. The N-terminal residues 1–147 or residues 1–181 of yCAF1 are completely inactive in yeast (11Draper M.P. Salvadore C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3487-3495Google Scholar). Growth was de"

Invasive illness occurs after organisms traverse an epithelial boundary and enter deeper tissues. Previously we have reported that the alpha C protein (ACP) on the surface of GBS mediates GBS entry into ME180 cervical epithelial cells and GBS translocation across layers of these cells. We now demonstrate that ACP interacts with host cell glycosaminoglycan (GAG); the interaction of ACP with ME180 cells is inhibited if cells are pretreated with sodium chlorate, an inhibitor of sulfate incorporation, or with heparitinases. The interaction is also inhibited in the presence of soluble heparin or heparan sulfate or host cell-derived GAG. In addition, ACP binds soluble heparin specifically in inhibition and dot blot assays. After interaction with host GAG, soluble ACP enters ME180 cells and fractionates to the eukaryotic cell cytosol. These events are inhibited in cells pretreated with cytochalasin D or with Clostridium difficile toxin B. These data indicate that full-length ACP interacts with ME180 cell GAG and enters the eukaryotic cell cytosol by a mechanism that involves Rho GTPase-dependent actin rearrangements. We suggest that these molecular interactions drive ACP-mediated translocation of GBS across epithelial barriers, thereby facilitating invasive GBS infection.

A frequent colonizer of the human gastrointestinal and gynecological tracts, GBS has been noted more recently to cause a range of invasive syndromes in non-pregnant adults. Most commonly these patients have comorbid conditions, including malignancy, diabetes, and renal disease (1Jackson L.A. Hilsdon R. Farley M.M. Harrison L.H. Reingold A.L. Plikaytis B.D. Wenger J.D. Schuchat A. Ann. Intern. Med. 1995; 123: 415-420Google Scholar), that may predispose to bacterial invasion because of a loss of epithelial barrier protection in a chronically colonized site such as the rectum, vagina, cervix, urethra, skin, or pharynx. The molecular basis of the interaction between GBS and epithelial cells remains poorly understood. We have reported that the alpha C protein (ACP) on the surface of GBS interacts with epithelial cells. Expressed by many serotype Ia, Ib, and II GBS strains, ACP is the prototype for a family of Gram-positive surface proteins, the alpha-like proteins (Alps). Found on most GBS strains and some Enterococcus and group A Streptococcus strains, Alps share considerable sequence homology and common structural elements, including an N-terminal region, a series of tandem repeats of ∼80 amino acids each, and a C-terminal region containing a cell-wall anchor LPXTG motif common to several Gram-positive species. Despite the fact that these proteins may vary in size due to gene truncation within the repeat region (2Madoff L.C. Michel J.L. Gong E.W. Kling D.E. Kasper D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4131-4136Google Scholar), Alps elicit protective antibody in both adult and neonatal mouse models of GBS sepsis (3Madoff L.C. Michel J.L. Kasper D.L. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 204-210Google Scholar). In a neonatal mouse model of disease, deletion of the gene encoding ACP attenuates the virulence of GBS, with significant survival differences during the first 24 h of infection (4Li J. Kasper D.L. Ausubel F.M. Rosner B. Michel J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13251-13256Google Scholar). In vitro, the ACP-deficient mutant both enters ME180 human cervical epithelial cells and transcytoses across layers of these cells less effectively than the wild-type parent strain (5Bolduc G.R. Baron M.J. Gravekamp C. Lachenauer C.S. Madoff L.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 751-758Google Scholar). Recombinantly derived soluble protein representing the N-terminal region of ACP inhibits the entry of wild-type GBS into these cells and inhibits the association of full-length soluble ACP with these cells. We sought to identify the host cell surface receptor interacting with soluble Alps, to determine whether soluble Alps enter eukaryotic cells, and, if so, to delineate the mode of entry and the intracellular destination of the protein after internalization. Because host cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) mediate internalization of other organisms (6Alvarez-Dominguez C. Vazquez-Boland J.A. Carrasco-Marin E. Lopez-Mato P. Leyva-Cobian F. Infect.

Based on the data described above and the N-terminal region sequence similarities among Alps (12Lachenauer C. Creti R. Michel J. Madoff L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9630-9635Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the binding of Alp N-terminal domains to a host cell surface GAG might trigger uptake of the ligand and attached structures into cell vacuoles. GBS strain A909 is the prototype serotype Ia/C (α+, β+) strain (13Lancefield R.C. McCarty M. Everly W.N. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 142: 165-179Google Scholar).

The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and the insert was excised with BamH1 and EcoR1 and cloned into the pTrcHisA expression vector (Invitrogen). The resulting construct was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The protein was expressed and purified as described previously (5Bolduc G.R. Baron M.J. Gravekamp C. Lachenauer C.S. Madoff L.C.

ME180 (ATCC HTB33), a human cervical epithelial carcinoma cell line, was purchased from ATCC and propagated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium with l-glutamine (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Fluorescent Labeling of Proteins—An AlexaFluor 488 protein labeling kit (A-10235; Molecular Probes) was used to conjugate AlexaFluor 488 dye to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Alp products, according to the manufacturer's instructions as described previously (5Bolduc G.R. Baron M.J. Gravekamp C. Lachenauer C.S. Madoff L.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 751-758Google Scholar). Cell Staining—ME180 cells were grown to monolayer confluence in 6-well plates with 2 ml of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), including 10% FCS (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). The day prior to the assay, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh medium, and the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The next day AlexaFluor-labeled Alp product or BSA or mouse monoclonal antibody to known ME180 surface components CD46 (BD Pharmingen International) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, Sigma) was added to the wells for a final concentration of 0.1 μm (18Kallstrom H.

The 6-well plates were then incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for up to 24 h. The medium was removed from the wells, and the monolayers were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS to remove nonadherent proteins. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma) was added to wells treated with CD46-specific and EGFR-specific antibodies, and cells were incubated for 1 h then washed with PBS. 350 μl of trypsin-EDTA (0.25% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA-4 Na, Invitrogen) was added to the wells, and plates were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were detached by repeat pipetting and harvested by centrifugation at 650 rpm (50 x g) for 8 min. Cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS and resuspended in 0.1 ml of 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, then incubated at 4 °C overnight. The samples were washed with 1 ml of PBS to remove the fixative, resuspended in 0.4 ml of PBS, filtered through a cell-strainer cap (Falcon), and analyzed by flow cytometry on the MoFLo (Cytomation) machine. The cell population of interest was identified by using the AlexaFluor-labeled BSA sample to define nonspecific staining and/or autofluorescence levels. Positive staining was defined as a fluorescent signal greater than that of 98.5% of the BSA-treated control cell population. Inhibition assays were performed as described above, but prior to incubation with soluble proteins, cells were treated with reagents, including sodium periodate (Sigma, 10 mm, incubated at room temperature for 1 h), tunicamycin (Sigma, 10 μg/ml, incubated at 37 °C for 72 h), heparitinases (Seikagaku, 10 milliunits/ml, incubated at 37 °C for 3 h), cytochalasin D (Sigma, 2.5 μg/ml, incubated at 37 °C for 2 h), chlorpromazine (Sigma, 25 μg/ml, preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min), hypertonic sucrose (0.3 m, preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h), brefeldin A (Sigma, 5 μm, preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min), or Clostridium difficile toxin B (List Biological Laboratories, Inc., Campbell, CA, 10 or 100 ng/ml, incubated at 37 °C for 24 h). The incubation conditions were selected based upon literature reports and upon pilot studies in which cell morphology was observed by light microscopy periodically during incubation to ensure that pretreatment did not produce any loss of monolayer integrity. Additional inhibition studies were performed by preincubating Alex-aFluor-labeled ACP or BSA with varying concentrations of inhibitor (heparin sodium, chondroitin sulfates A, B, and C, heparan sulfate (all purchased from Sigma), hyaluronic acid, N-acetylglucosamine, GBS type Ia polysaccharide (kindly provided by Dr. Dennis Kasper and Barbara Reinap), or cell-derived GAG (see below)) for 1 h at 4 °C prior to adding this mixture to ME180 cells and incubating as described above. ME180 cervical epithelial cells were grown to confluence on glass coverslips in 6-well plates in 2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with l-glutamine containing 10% FCS (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). The night before the experiment, the medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml of fresh media. The following morning, AlexaFluor 488-labeled protein (ACP or BSA) at 0.5 μm was added. The proteins were incubated with ME180 cells at 37 °C for varying periods up to 4 h. The monolayers were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS, then treated with 0.25 ml of 2% paraformaldehyde fixative in PBS, incubated overnight at 4 °C, and washed again with 1 ml of PBS. To mark the cell surface, the monolayers were then incubated with mouse monoclonal EGFR-specific antibody for 1 h, washed, and treated with a rhodamine-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma) for 1 h, then washed again. The coverslips were then mounted on glass slides with Fluorotec mounting media (Accurate Chem., Westbury, NY). The slides were reviewed by confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC-1024/MP multiphoton microscope, using a multiline krypton/argon laser for standard confocal microscopy, interfaced with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope). All images were viewed at the same gain value. Inhibition assays were performed similarly, except cells were preincubated (as described above) with reagents that included cytochalasin D and brefeldin A. Modeled after enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods (17Lachenauer C.S. Baker C.J. Baron M.J. Kasper D.L. Gravekamp C. Madoff L.C. J. Infect.

Absorbance at 405 nm (A405) was measured after incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated avidin (Pierce Endogen) diluted 1:3000 in incubation buffer and phosphatase substrate (Sigma). Optimal concentrations of ACP and biotinylated heparin were determined initially by checkerboard. ME180 cells were grown to confluence in 100 mm × 20 mm polystyrene culture dishes (Corning), then incubated at 37 °C overnight in 4 ml of 6× Pronase solution (1 mg/ml Pronase (Calbiochem), 0.24 m sodium acetate, 1.92 m sodium chloride, pH 6.5) and 20 ml of culture media. The following morning, the resulting material was spun at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and supernatant was filtered, diluted 1:1.5 with water to diminish the salt concentration, and adjusted to pH 6.5 with 0.01% Triton X-100. The diluted supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml DEAE-Sephacel column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been pre-equilibrated with 12 ml of 0.25 m sodium chloride, 20 mm sodium acetate, 0.01% Triton X-100, pH 6.0. The column was washed with 30 ml of 0.25 m sodium chloride, 20 mm sodium acetate, 0.01% Triton X-100, pH 6.0, then GAG was eluted with 5 ml of 1 m sodium chloride in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0. Ethanol (10 ml per 2.5-ml eluate) was added to the eluate, and the GAG was allowed to precipitate at 4 °C overnight. The following morning, precipitate was spun for 10 min at 3000 rpm, and the pellet was washed with 1 ml of 70% ethanol, centrifuged for 7 min at 3000 rpm, and dried. The resulting material was resuspended in PBS for further studies. GAG concentration was measured by our kind collaborators Dr. Robert Rosenberg and Andre Love using Beckman's chromatographic equipment. Purified GAG was acid hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl. Automated o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA, Sigma) derivatization was performed with the 508 autosampler that was programmed to draw 31 μl of borate buffer, 4 μl of OPA, plus 5 μl of GAG sample and mix into the destination vial prior to autoinjection. Chromatographic separations were performed through a MAX-RP C12 column (Phenomenex). The mobile phase flow rate was 0.8 ml/min, and a binary gradient was employed where mobile phase A was 0.1 m sodium phosphate monobasic, pH 6.4, mobile phase B was mobile phase A, methanol, and tetrahydrofuran (30:70:3, v/v). For detection of the OPA-labeled sugars, the excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 340 and 450 nm, respectively. Titrations of glucosamine and Nor-leucine were used to generate an external standard curve from which GAG quantitations were obtained. A known amount of Nor-leucine, as the internal standard, was added to samples prior to hydrolysis. The chromatographic areas of GAG were calculated from the external standard curve and corrected with the internal standard. The amount of glucosamine in the hydrolyzed GAG sample was then used to calculate the concentration of GAG in the original sample as follows: grams of glucosamine × 450 (avg. molecular weight of disaccharide)/179 (average molecular weight of glucosamine) = grams of GAG. Digitonin Treatment (Modified from Ref. 21Lee V.T. Anderson D.M. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 593-601Google Scholar)—Confluent ME180 cells were incubated with 0.5 μm soluble ACP at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Cells were washed to remove unbound protein and then treated with 1% digitonin (Sigma), which binds membrane sterols, resulting in selective solubilization of the eukaryotic plasma membrane. The cells were detached using a rubber policeman and centrifuged at 20,000 × g to separate cytosolic components (supernatant) from cellular material (pellet). The samples were treated with methanol and chloroform to extract proteins, then suspended in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and evaluated by Western blot using 4G8, a monoclonal antibody to the ACP repeat region (3Madoff L.C. Michel J.L. Kasper D.L. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 204-210Google Scholar). Mechanical Fractionation (Modified from Ref. 22Schroter C.J. Braun M. Englert J. Beck H. Schmid H. Kalbacher H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 227: 161-168Google Scholar)—Confluent ME180 cells were incubated with ACP as described above, then detached from flasks by trypsin treatment, washed, and passed through a 27-gauge needle to lyse the cells. The resulting material was spun sequentially at 2500 rpm to pellet intact cells, at 8000 rpm to pellet nuclei, mitochondria, and other large organelles, and finally at 40,000 rpm to pellet lysosomal/endosomal compartments. The pellets were solubilized in 1% SDS. The final supernatant and solubilized pellets were treated with methanol and chloroform to extract proteins as described above, then evaluated by Western blot with monoclonal antibody recognizing ACP. Modeled after an immunoblot assay, protein binding to heparin was studied with a modified dot-blot technique (23Madoff L.C. Hori S. Michel J.L. Baker C.J. Kasper D.L. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2638-2644Google Scholar). Proteins (1 μg of each) were applied to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then blocked with 5% skim milk for 1 h. The membrane was then incubated with heparin-albumin-biotin (Sigma) at 0.05 mg/ml for 1 h, followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated avidin (Pierce Endogen) for 1 h before washing and developing. These were performed as described in a previous study (5Bolduc G.R. Baron M.J. Gravekamp C. Lachenauer C.S. Madoff L.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 751-758Google Scholar). For inhibition studies, these assays were modified as follows: ME180 cells were preincubated with individual ACP or Alp3 inhibitors for 1 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 prior to adding GBS. Eukaryotic Cell GAG Interacts with ACP—The ability of ACP to associate with cells despite the trypsin treatment used for detachment of cells prior to flow cytometry analysis (5Bolduc G.R. Baron M.J. Gravekamp C. Lachenauer C.S. Madoff L.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 751-758Google Scholar), in combination with the importance of host cell surface GAG molecules in mediating entry of many pathogens (6Alvarez-Dominguez C. Vazquez-Boland J.A. Carrasco-Marin E. Lopez-Mato P. Leyva-Cobian F. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 78-88Google Scholar, 7Bose S. Banerjee A.K. Virology. 2002; 298: 73-83Google Scholar, 8Calvet C.M. Toma L. De Souza F.R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2144-2154Google Scholar), led us to hypothesize that ACP might bind to cell surface GAG. In support of this hypothesis, cell staining with labeled ACP was diminished in ME180 cells pretreated with sodium periodate (which oxidizes surface carbohydrates) or with tunicamycin (which inhibits protein glycosylation) (data not shown). The following studies demonstrate more specifically that cellular GAG interacts with ACP. Sodium Chlorate Treatment of ME180 Cells Decreases Cellular ACP Association—To prevent sulfation of glycoproteins and carbohydrates (24Bauerle P.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 870-877Google Scholar), we treated confluent ME180 cells with sodium chlorate then added labeled ACP. This treatment diminished the cellular accumulation of ACP by 86.4-94% as measured by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 1). These data indicate that a sulfated host cell structure, such as GAG, interacts with ACP. Heparitinase Treatment of ME180 Cells Decreases Cellular ACP Association—Treatment of confluent ME180 cells with heparitinases prior to incubation with ACP diminished the cellular accumulation of ACP by 98% compared with untreated cells in flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 1). In contrast, pretreatment of ME180 cells with chondroitinase ABC (Sigma) did not diminish staining. These data demonstrate that ACP recognizes a cellular GAG that is altered by heparitinase treatment. Soluble GAG Inhibits Association of ACP with ME180 Cells—To investigate the type of cell surface GAG involved, we preincubated labeled soluble ACP with varying concentrations of soluble heparin (Sigma), then added this mixture to confluent ME180 cells. Flow cytometry analysis of the cells shows ACP accumulation diminished in proportion to the concentration of soluble heparin (Fig. 2). Specifically, 500 μg/ml heparin reduced ACP staining by 59.2%. At similar concentrations, heparan sulfate diminished ACP staining by 58.2%, whereas a mixture of chondroitin sulfate A and chondroitin sulfate C (Sigma C6737, ∼57% type A and 43% type C) diminished ACP staining by 33.3%. Similar concentrations of other sulfated and non-sulfated carbohydrates, including chondroitin sulfate B, chondroitin sulfate C, hyaluronic acid, GBS type Ia capsular polysaccharide, and N-acetylglucosamine, showed no substantive effect on the interaction of ACP with ME180 cells. These data indicate specificity in the interaction between ACP and heparin/heparan sulfate. Soluble ACP Specifically Binds Soluble Heparin—To further evaluate the degree of specificity with which heparin binds to ACP, we performed an inhibition assay, coating a microtiter plate with ACP (20 μg/ml), then incubating with 200 μg/ml heparin-albumin-biotin (Sigma) and unlabeled heparin in concentrations ranging from 0 to 25 mg/ml. After washing, bound biotinylated heparin was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated avidin and substrate. Decreasing concentrations of biotinylated heparin bound ACP in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor (Fig. 3). Specifically, 1000 μg/ml unlabeled heparin inhibited binding of labeled heparin by 84.1%. These results suggest that ACP binds specifically to heparin. Soluble GAG Derived from ME180 Cells Inhibits Interaction of ACP with ME180 Cells—To assess the interaction between ACP and cell surface GAG more directly, we purified ME180 cell surface GAG from other cellular components using the methods described above. The resulting GAG was added, in varying concentrations, to labeled ACP and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h before this mixture was added to confluent ME180 cells. The cells were subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry and showed concentration-dependent inhibition of ACP interaction with ME180 cells in the presence of ME180-derived GAG (Fig. 4). At ∼2 μg/ml, the highest tested concentration of GAG, ACP staining was inhibited by 57.5%. Although we cannot eliminate the possibility that contaminants present in small amounts in our preparation of purified GAG are responsible for the observed effects, these data further support the hypothesis that full ACP binds to cellular GAG. Kinetics of ACP Association with ME180 Cells—Based on our hypothesis that ACP recognizes ME180 surface GAG, we anticipated that soluble protein should associate with cells rapidly, within minutes. To test this hypothesis, we incubated confluent ME180 cells with fluorescently labeled protein (BSA or soluble ACP) at 37 °C for varying periods of time up to 24 h. Soluble ACP stained 21.08% of cells at 30 min, 64.15% of cells at 60 min, 95.09% of cells at 4 h, 99.22% of cells at 12 h, and 99.67% of cells at 24 h (Fig. 5). Of note, the majority of signal accumulated after 30 min of incubation. The mean levels of fluorescent signal per cell (data not shown) continued to increase during the later period as well, from 87.58 at 12 h, to 111.36 at 24 h. The BSA control samples changed minimally in signal over the entire time course. The gradual kinetics of cellular ACP accumulation, in combination with prior data indicating that ACP mediates internalization of GBS (5Bolduc G.R. Baron M.J. Gravekamp C. Lachenauer C.S. Madoff L.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 751-758Google Scholar), led us to test the hypothesis that the soluble ACP might enter cells over time. Soluble ACP Enters ME180 Cell Cytoplasm—We incubated confluent ME180 cells on a glass coverslip with labeled ACP for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed, fixed, stained with mouse monoclonal EGFR-specific antibody and a rhodamine-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody to mark the cell surface, and viewed by confocal microscopy. As shown (Fig. 6), ACP (green) is distributed throughout the cell interior, whereas EGFR (red) stains circumferentially. Images collected as a Z plane series (eight slices from top to bottom of the monolayer) include green signal in multiple planes, including slices 4 and 5, situated midway between the cell base and cell apex. Additional studies (not shown) were performed using fluorescently labeled phalloidin to identify the actin cytoskeleton. Images from these studies also show internal signal from labeled ACP. To further detect intracellular ACP, we evaluated the effect of an anti-AlexaFluor antibody (Molecular Probes) that quenches the fluorescence of AlexaFluor-488. This antibody (rabbit IgG) was added to ME180 cells that had been incubated with AlexaFluor-488-labeled ACP as described above. A rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody was then added to detect the anti-AlexaFluor antibody. Because we used no cell-permeabilizing treatment, we expected that surface-bound ACP (green) signal would be quenched and replaced by rhodamine (red) signal, whereas internal ACP signal would persist (green), because this ACP is inaccessible to the anti-AlexaFluor and secondary antibodies. The images (not shown) reveal green signal surrounded by peripheral red signal. Control samples without the quenching antibody show diffuse green signal and minimal red background. Control samples without ACP also show minimal red background, along with minimal green signal. These data support our hypothesis that free ACP enters ME180 cells. To confirm this finding and to determine the intracellular location of ACP, we incubated cells with ACP, washed away unbound material, and fractionated the samples either chemically (by selectively solubilizing the plasma membranes with 1% digitonin) or mechanically (by passing the cells through a 27-gauge needle), as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Resulting proteins in cellular fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and evaluated by Western blot using a monoclonal antibody recognizing ACP. These data (Fig. 7a) show full-length ACP in both the digitonin-derived pellet (membranous/cellular material) fraction and the supernatant (cytosol) fraction. Negative control studies included ME180 cells incub"

https://openalex.org/W2143812366,"The individual roles of hepatic versus intestinal ABCG5 and ABCG8 in sterol transport have not yet been investigated. To determine the specific contribution of liver ABCG5/G8 to sterol transport and atherosclerosis, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress human ABCG5 and ABCG8 in the liver but not intestine (liver G5/G8-Tg) in three different genetic backgrounds: C57Bl/6, apoE-KO, and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr)-KO. Hepatic overexpression of ABCG5/G8 enhanced hepatobiliary secretion of cholesterol and plant sterols by 1.5–2-fold, increased the amount of intestinal cholesterol available for absorption and fecal excretion by up to 27%, and decreased the accumulation of plant sterols in plasma by ∼25%. However, it did not alter fractional intestinal cholesterol absorption, fecal neutral sterol excretion, hepatic cholesterol concentrations, or hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Consequently, overexpression of ABCG5/G8 in only the liver had no effect on the plasma lipid profile, including cholesterol, HDL-C, and non-HDL-C, or on the development of proximal aortic atherosclerosis in C57Bl/6, apoE-KO, or LDLr-KO mice. Thus, liver ABCG5/G8 facilitate the secretion of liver sterols into bile and serve as an alternative mechanism, independent of intestinal ABCG5/G8, to protect against the accumulation of dietary plant sterols in plasma. However, in the absence of changes in fractional intestinal cholesterol absorption, increased secretion of sterols into bile induced by hepatic overexpression of ABCG5/G8 was not sufficient to alter hepatic cholesterol balance, enhance cholesterol removal from the body or to alter atherogenic risk in liver G5/G8-Tg mice. These findings demonstrate that overexpression of ABCG5/G8 in the liver profoundly alters hepatic but not intestinal sterol transport, identifying distinct roles for liver and intestinal ABCG5/G8 in modulating sterol metabolism.

Second, both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that ABCG5/G8 gene expression is modulated by transcription factors previously implicated in lipid and sterol metabolism. Agonists of LXR, a nuclear hormone receptor involved in sterol metabolism, enhance ABCG5/G8 gene expression in rat hepatoma cells (19Repa J.J. Berge K.E. Pomajzl C. Richardson J.A. Hobbs H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18793-18800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), and feeding mice cholesterol-rich diets up-regulates ABCG5/G8 gene expression in the liver and intestine of normal but not LXRα-deficient mice (10Berge K.E.

Deficiency of ABCG5 and ABCG8 in mice leads to increased intestinal cholesterol absorption and decreased gall bladder bile cholesterol concentration (23Yu L. Hammer R.E. Li-Hawkins J. von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16237-16242Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), a phenotype similar to that of patients with sitosterolemia. Conversely, overexpression of human ABCG5/G8 raised the gall bladder cholesterol concentrations by more than 5-fold and reduced dietary sterol absorption by 50% in transgenic mice (24Yu L. Li-Hawkins J. Hammer R.E. Berge K.E. Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Finally, recent studies in mice and rats have demonstrated an association between ABCG5 and ABCG8 gene expression and changes in biliary cholesterol secretion and intestinal cholesterol absorption (25Bloks V.W. Bakker-van Waarde W.M. Verkade H.J. Kema I.P. Wolters H. Vink E. Groen A.K. Kuipers F. Diabetologia Clin. Exp. Diabetes Metab. 2003; 47: 104-112Google Scholar, 26Kamisako T. Ogawa H. Hepatol.

Thus, ABCG5/G8 are transporters that play a major role in the excretion of cholesterol and other sterols from the body. Here we report the generation of transgenic mice that selectively overexpress hABCG5/G8 in the liver of C57Bl/6, apoE-KO, and LDL receptor (LDLr)-KO mice. We describe the contribution of liver ABCG5/G8 to hepatobiliary sterol transport and evaluate the effects of hepatic overexpression of these transporters on the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Our studies directly demonstrate a role for liver ABCG5/G8 in facilitating sterol secretion into bile and in reducing the plasma concentrations of potentially pro-atherogenic plant sterols in plasma. However, hepatic overexpression of ABCG5/G8 did not reduce fractional intestinal cholesterol absorption nor facilitate the elimination of cholesterol from liver G5/G8-Tg mice over that of control mice. Hence, despite increased hepatobiliary sterol secretion, overexpression of ABCG5/G8 in the liver did not alter hepatic cholesterol concentrations or induce compensatory changes in liver enzymes or in hepatic receptors that might lead to antiatherogenic changes in the plasma lipoprotein profile and decrease aortic atherosclerosis in C57Bl/6, apoE-KO and LDLr-KO mice. These findings identify separate functions for hepatic and intestinal ABCG5/G8, and suggest that increased expression of intestinal as well as hepatic ABCG5/G8 may be required to significantly increase the elimination of body cholesterol and modulate atherogenic risk. Generation of ABCG5/G8 Transgenic Mice—A fully characterized and sequenced 140-kb BAC clone (BAC 26313; Incyte Genomics, Palo Alto, CA) encoding the complete ABCG5 and ABCG8 proteins (28Remaley A.

Integration of the hABCG5/G8 genes was determined by dot blot hybridization analysis of genomic mouse tail DNA using full-length hABCG5/G8 cDNA probes and confirmed by PCR using human-specific ABCG5/G8 primers (sequences available upon request). Several different mouse lines expressing hABCG5/G8 were identified and expanded for further studies. To generate apoE-KO or LDLr-KO mice overexpressing hABCG5/G8, transgenic mice were crossed with apoE-KO or LDLr-KO mice in the C57Bl/6 background. All experiments were performed according to a research protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the NHLBI, National Institutes of Health. Diets—Control and transgenic mice (2–5 months of age) were maintained on the NIH-31 rodent diet (Harlan Teklad, Madison WI), designated as the regular chow diet (RCD: 0.025% cholesterol, 0.05% sitosterol, 0.015% campesterol, and 0.007% stigmasterol), or a 4% cholesterol diet (designated 4% C; 3.9% cholesterol, 0.04% sitosterol, 0.016% campesterol, and 0.009% stigmasterol) for a period of 10–12 weeks prior to analyses. To induce the formation of aortic lesions, C57Bl/6 control and transgenic mice were placed on the high fat, high cholesterol/cholate (HF-HC) diet as described (30Paigen B. Morrow A. Holmes P.A.

All diets were analyzed by Woodson-Tenent Laboratories (Memphis, TN) to confirm their sterol content. Daily food intake was measured in a representative group of four mice for each study group. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated (Ultraspec Kit, Biotecx, Houston, TX) from age- and sex-matched mice per the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (20–30 μg) was subjected to Northern analysis by hybridizing with 32P-labeled cDNA probes that detect either: (i) both human and mouse ABCG5 and ABCG8 mRNA (human ABCG5, full-length; human ABCG8, bp 1047–2561); (ii) only mouse ABCG5 and ABCG8 mRNA (mouse ABCG5, bp 2097–2287; mouse ABCG8, bp 2122–2236); and (iii) only human ABCG5 and ABCG8 mRNA (human ABCG5, bp 2099–2320; human ABCG8, bp 2112–2244). Other probes used include Cyp-7α hydroxylase (bp 719–1738), LDLr, HMGCoA reductase, ABCA1, and β-actin as described (32Joyce C. Amar M.J.A. Lambert G. Vaisman B.L. Paigen B. Najib-Fruchart J.

For RT-PCR, total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScriptII First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT) primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human and mouse ABCG5/G8 mRNA levels were quantitated by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green kit (Roche Applied Science) and a LightCycler, with mouse succinate dehydrogenase for normalization (Mouse SDHA-Certified LUX™ Primer Set, Invitrogen).

Bile Cannulations and Bile Assays—Mice fed different diets for 10–12 weeks were weighed, fasted for 4–6 h, and anesthetized with IP avertin (1.25%; 0.015–0.017 ml/gram body weight) at mid-dark cycle. The cystic duct, exposed by an upper midline abdominal incision, was clamped and the common bile duct was cannulated with a PE-10 polyethylene catheter with an inside diameter of 0.28 mm and an outside diameter of 0.61 mm (BD Biosciences Primary Care Diagnostics, Sparks, MD) superior to the sphincter of Oddi but inferior to the entrance of the cystic duct. Bile was collected for 45 min by gravity. Animals were maintained at 37 °C with a heat lamp. Total bile sterols were measured by both GC (Model GC2010, Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) as described below and by the cholesterol assay kit (Sigma). Bile acids were assayed with the bile acid assay kit (Sigma). Bile phospholipid content was assayed with the phospholipid assay kit (Wako, Richmond, VA). Analysis of Sterol Composition—Aliquots of plasma and bile for high pressure liquid chromatography analysis were extracted in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and separated by addition of water (35Folch R.J. Lees M. Sloan-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were hydrolyzed with 1 m ethanolic KOH at 80 °C for 1 h and extracted twice with hexane. Sterols were converted to their benzoate derivatives with benzoyl chloride reagent, re-extracted with dichloromethane, dissolved in acetonitrile/dichloromethane (2:1, v/v) and injected into a reverse phase column Ultrasphere 5μ C18 150 × 4.6 mm (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) according to the method of Kasama et al. (36Kasama T. Byun D.S. Seyama Y. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 400: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The eluting solvent was acetonitrile/acetic acid (100:0.2) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The instrument was a Waters 600 controller, 717 autosampler, and 486 tunable absorbance detector with column oven (Waters, Milford, MA). Peaks were processed using the Waters Millenium32, version 3.2 software, using sterol standards obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Cholesterol Absorption—Male mice (4–8 months of age) maintained on the RC diet were used for cholesterol absorption studies by the plasma dual-isotope ratio method (37Zilversmit D.B. Hughes L.B. J.

Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 328-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. Approximately 100 mg (wet weight) of liver and 50 mg (dry weight) of ground stool was homogenized in 1 ml of H2O. Sterols were extracted by adding 21 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and 4.5 ml of H2O (35Folch R.J. Lees M. Sloan-Stanley G.H. J. Biol.

Aliquots of the organic extract were saponified in ethanolic-KOH, sterols were extracted in hexane, and an aliquot of the hexane extract was dried and dissolved in ethyl acetate. The concentration of total neutral sterols in ethyl acetate was then measured by GC. Fecal excretion of cholesterol and its breakdown products was calculated by adding coprostanol, cholestanol and cholesterol measured in feces by GC. In parallel studies, dried aliquots of the Folch extract were dissolved in isopropyl alcohol for analysis of hepatic and fecal total neutral sterols using an enzymatic assay as described (41Gamble W.

Atherosclerosis. 1987; 68: 231-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). 3-mm sections of the aortic root and ascending aorta were stained with oil-red-O for neutral lipids and hematoxylin for nucleic tissue. Five sections per animal were evaluated to determine the mean cross-sectional area of lesions for each animal (30Paigen B. Morrow A. Holmes P.A. Mitchell D. Williams R.A. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 68: 231-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistically significant differences between control and transgenic mice were assessed by Student's t test and defined as a two-tailed probability of less than 0.05. Non-parametric data was analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test (Instat Software, Graphpad, Inc., San Diego, CA). Liver-specific Overexpression of Human ABCG5/G8 Does Not Alter Hepatobiliary Sterol Secretion and Intestinal Cholesterol Absorption on a Low Sterol Diet—ABCG5 and ABCG8 expressed in liver and intestine have important roles in biliary and intestinal sterol transport (10Berge K.E.

Many of the molecular factors that govern tumor initiation and progression remain unknown. Here, we evaluate the transformation suppressor potential of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and its ability to cooperate with a well established tumor suppressor, the INK4a locus. To study the effects of loss of caveolin-1 on cellular transformation, we established immortalized primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing and lacking caveolin-1 by interbreeding Cav-1 (+/+) and Cav-1 (-/-) mice with INK4a (-/-) mice. Analysis of these cells reveals that loss of caveolin-1 confers a significant growth advantage, as measured via cellular proliferation and cell cycle analysis. Loss of caveolin-1 in the INK4a (-/-) genetic background results in constitutive hyperactivation of the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade, decreased expression of p21Cip1, as well as cyclin D1 and PCNA overexpression, consistent with their hyperproliferative phenotype. Importantly, in cells lacking Cav-1 expression, transformation by activated oncogenes (H-RasG12V or v-Src) results in increased tumor growth in vivo (up to >40-fold). Finally, INK4a (-/-)/Cav-1 (-/-) mice demonstrate disturbed mammary epithelial ductal morphology, with hyperplasia, increased side-branching, and fibrosis.

https://openalex.org/W2040984041,"Antioxidants are important candidate agents for the prevention of disease. However, the possibility that different antioxidants may produce opposing effects in tissues has not been adequately explored. We have reported previously that (–)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a green tea polyphenol antioxidant, stimulates expression of the keratinocyte differentiation marker, involucrin (hINV), via a Ras, MEKK1, MEK3, p38δ signaling cascade (Balasubramanian, S., Efimova, T., and Eckert, R. L. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 1828–1836). We now show that EGCG activation of this pathway results in increased CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPα and C/EBPβ) factor level and increased complex formation at the hINV promoter C/EBP DNA binding site. This binding is associated with increased promoter activity. Mutation of the hINV promoter C/EBP binding site eliminates the regulation as does expression of GADD153, a dominant-negative C/EBP factor. In contrast, a second antioxidant, curcumin, inhibits the EGCG-dependent promoter activation. This is associated with inhibition of the EGCG-dependent increase in C/EBP factor level and C/EBP factor binding to the hINV promoter. Curcumin also inhibits the EGCG-dependent increase in endogenous hINV levels. The curcumin-dependent suppression of C/EBP factor level is inhibited by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that the proteasome function is required for curcumin action. We conclude that curcumin and EGCG produce opposing effects on involucrin gene expression via regulation of C/EBP factor function.

The observation that two antioxidants can produce opposite effects is an important consideration in the context of therapeutic antioxidant use. IntroductionThe human epidermis is a stratifying squamous epithelium comprised of a single, basally located layer of proliferating keratinocytes and multiple suprabasal layers of differentiating keratinocytes (1Green H. Harvey Lect. 1980; 74: 101-139Google Scholar, 2Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Robinson N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 397-424Google Scholar, 3Eckert R.L. Rorke E.A. Environ. Health Perspect. 1989; 80: 109-116Google Scholar, 4Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Google Scholar). During differentiation, keratinocytes undergo a choreographed series of morphological and biochemical changes that result in the assembly of a protective cornified envelope (5Steinert P.M. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 33-40Google Scholar). Involucrin is a component of this structure that is specifically expressed in the epidermal suprabasal layers (6Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Google Scholar, 7Yaffe M.B. Murthy S. Eckert R.L. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 3-9Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Activation of involucrin gene expression is controlled by a p38 MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; EGCG, (–)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate; hINV, human involucrin; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; KSFM, keratinocyte serum-free medium; EBS, ets factor binding site; caRas, constitutively active Ras. signaling cascade. This cascade includes novel protein kinase C, Ras, MEKK1, MEK3, and p38 (8Balasubramanian S. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1828-1836Google Scholar), and it targets various transcription factors (9Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Google Scholar, 10Banks E.B. Crish J.F. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 61-68Google Scholar, 11Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Google Scholar). These factors, in turn, bind to the hINV promoter upstream regulatory region (nucleotides –2473 to –1) to activate hINV gene expression (9Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Google Scholar, 12Efimova T. Deucher A. Kuroki T. Ohba M. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31753-31760Google Scholar). In the present manuscript, we utilize this system to study the role of antioxidants in regulating keratinocyte function.Antioxidants comprise a collection of agents, derived from various sources, that are potential disease-preventive agents (13Kelloff G.J. Crowell J.A. Steele V.E. Lubet R.A. Boone C.W. Malone W.A. Hawk E.T. Lieberman R. Lawrence J.A. Kopelovich L. Ali I. Viner J.L. Sigman C.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 889: 1-13Google Scholar, 14Mukhtar H. Ahmad N. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 234-238Google Scholar, 15Dong Z. Biofactors. 2000; 12: 17-28Google Scholar). We have reported recently that (–)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a green tea polyphenol antioxidant, increases hINV promoter activity and endogenous hINV expression in normal epidermal keratinocytes (8Balasubramanian S. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1828-1836Google Scholar). An important question is whether individual antioxidants produce similar or opposing effects in cells. This is important because these agents are being considered for use in treating a host of diseases, and the possibility exists that simultaneous treatment with structurally dissimilar antioxidants may produce opposing effects. To investigate this possibility, we have examined the interplay between EGCG and a second antioxidant, curcumin, in regulating involucrin gene expression.EGCG is the major bioactive polyphenol component of green tea and has been reported to regulate a wide range of processes in a variety of cell types (16Ahmad N. Mukhtar H. Nutr. Rev. 1999; 57: 78-83Google Scholar, 17Chung J.Y. Park J.O. Phyu H. Dong Z. Yang C.S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2022-2024Google Scholar, 18Chung J.Y. Huang C. Meng X. Dong Z. Yang C.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4610-4617Google Scholar). Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), commonly called turmeric, is a polyphenol derived from the plant Curcuma longa (19Bonte F. Noel-Hudson M.S. Wepierre J. Meybeck A. Planta Med. 1997; 63: 265-266Google Scholar, 20Aggarwal B.B. Kumar A. Bharti A.C. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 363-398Google Scholar, 21Leu T.H. Maa M.C. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Canc. Agents. 2002; 2: 357-370Google Scholar). Both agents are effective cancer therapeutic and prevention agents. However, because of the varying chemical structure of these agents, some of their effects may be unrelated to their antioxidant properties. Thus, it is important to evaluate the effects of individual antioxidants to determine whether they produce contributing or opposing effects. In the present study, we show that curcumin opposes the EGCG-dependent activation of involucrin gene expression by inhibiting the EGCG-dependent increase in C/EBP transcription factor levels. These finding indicate that not all antioxidants produce parallel changes in human keratinocyte function and indicate that potential opposing effects of these agents must be considered when antioxidants are proposed for therapeutic use.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and Reagents—(–)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate and curcumin were purchased from Sigma. EGCG was prepared as 1000-fold stock in sterile distilled water. MG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO) was purchased from Biomol.

Chemiluminescence was measured using a Berthold luminometer, and synthetic oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. C/EBP transcription factor-selective rabbit polyclonal antibodies specifying C/EBPα (sc-61X, 1:500), C/EBPβ (sc-150X, 1:2000), C/EBPδ (sc-636X, 1:500), and GADD153 (sc-793, 1:500) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. An antibody specific for β-actin from Sigma (A5441) was used for immunoblot at a dilution of 1:10,000.Plasmids—The structure of the hINV promoter reporter plasmid, pINV-241, has been described previously (11Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Google Scholar). To create pINV-241(C/EBPm), the C/EBP site mutant, the fragment containing the wild type C/EBP site (5′-GCTGCTTAAG-3′), was released as part of a larger fragment by digestion of pINV-241 with ApaI/PstI and replaced with the identical segment containing a mutated C/EBP site (5′-GCTGAGATCT-3′) (9Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Google Scholar). The modified nucleotides are underlined. C/EBPα was kindly provided by Dr. David Samols (Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine) (22Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Darlington G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4726-4733Google Scholar).

Carlson S.G. Sollott S.J. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20465-20470Google Scholar). Constitutively active Ras (RasG12V) was obtained from Dr. Michael Simonson (26Herman W.H. Simonson M.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19067-19073Google Scholar).Cell Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Normal human foreskin keratinocytes were isolated and cultured as described previously (9Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Google Scholar). Keratinocytes (60% confluent, third passage) were transfected in 9.5-cm2-area dishes. FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was added to KSFM at a final concentration of 4% and incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. The mixture was then added to 2 μg of involucrin promoter reporter plasmid or, for co-transfection experiments, with 1 μg of involucrin reporter plasmid and 1 μg of a second plasmid. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and then added directly to the cultures in 2 ml of KSFM. The final DNA concentration in all groups was adjusted to 2 μg of DNA/4 μlof FuGENE 6 reagent/9.5-cm2 dish by addition of empty expression vector. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with KSFM in the presence or absence of EGCG and/or curcumin. After an additional 24 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, dissolved in 200 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega), and harvested by scraping. Luciferase activity was assayed immediately using Promega luciferase assay kit and a Berthold luminometer. All assays were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. Luciferase activity was normalized per μg of protein. Transfection efficiency was normalized using a green fluorescent protein-encoding expression vector.Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Gel Mobility Shift Analysis— Cultured keratinocytes (80% confluent) were treated for 24 h with KSFM or with KSFM containing 40 μm EGCG and/or 20 μm curcumin prior to preparation of nuclear extracts (8Balasubramanian S. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1828-1836Google Scholar). The protein content was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Binding of transcription factors to the hINV promoter C/EBP site was detected using gel mobility shift assay (8Balasubramanian S. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1828-1836Google Scholar). Five μg of nuclear extract was incubated for 10 min at room temperature in a total volume of 20 μl containing 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 100,000 cpm of radioactive double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide, 5′-GGTTTGCTGCTTAAGATGCCTG-3′, that encodes the hINV C/EBP binding site (C/EBP site is underlined) was end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. For competition studies, radioinert DNA competitor was added to the DNA binding reaction at 10- or 100-fold molar excess. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel using 0.5× Tris/borate/EDTA running buffer. The gel was dried, and the radioactivity was detected by autoradiography.Immunoblot Analysis—Total cell extracts were prepared from cultured human keratinocytes as described previously (8Balasubramanian S. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1828-1836Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of protein were electrophoresed on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were blocked, incubated with a specific primary antibody, washed, and exposed to an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Biosciences) was used to visualize secondary antibody binding.RESULTSC/EBP Site Is Required for EGCG-dependent hINV Promoter Regulation—We first examined the effects of EGCG treatment on hINV promoter activity. Fig. 1A shows a schematic of the hINV promoter constructs. Promoter activity assays, shown in Fig. 1B, indicate that EGCG treatment produces a 4-fold increase in activity of the intact hINV promoter construct, pINV-241. Mutation of the C/EBP site, pINV-241(C/EBPm), results in a loss of the EGCG-dependent regulation. As a control, we examined the effects of EGCG treatment on a promoter construct in which an ets factor binding site (EBS), pINV-241(EBS-2m), is mutated. This mutation results in an overall increase in basal and EGCG-stimulated promoter activity, but the 4-fold EGCG-dependent increase is still observed. These results suggest that the C/EBP site is specifically required for EGCG-dependent gene expression. Fig. 1C confirms relevance of the response by showing that endogenous hINV gene expression is increased by 4-fold as measured by increased presence of hINV protein. Additional studies reveal a parallel increase in hINV mRNA (not shown).EGCG Increases C/EBPα-dependent hINV Promoter Activation—The above results suggest that C/EBP factors may be important mediators of the EGCG-dependent response. To test this further, we evaluated whether C/EBP factors influence hINV promoter activity. Cells were transfected with pINV-241 in the presence of expression vectors encoding C/EBPα, -β, or -δ. Fig. 2A shows that hINV promoter activity is markedly increased in the presence of C/EBPα, with a lesser increase observed in the presence of C/EBPβ and -δ. In contrast, GADD153, a dominant-negative C/EBP family member that suppresses function of other C/EBP proteins by inhibiting their interaction with DNA (9Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Google Scholar), completely inhibits the EGCG-dependent increase (Fig. 2B). Basal activity is also inhibited, indicating that basal transcription also relies on C/EBP factors. Fig. 2C confirms that C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and GADD153 are each expressed when cells are treated with the corresponding expression vector. Longer exposure of these films revealed the presence of endogenous C/EBPα and C/EBPβ; however, C/EBPδ was not detected (not shown).Fig. 2C/EBP factor activity is required for EGCG-dependent regulation of hINV gene expression. A, keratinocytes were co-transfected with 1 μg of pINV-241 reporter construct and 1 μg of empty expression vector (EV) or vectors encoding C/EBPα, -β, or -δ. After 48 h, the cells were harvested and assayed for the luciferase activity. Activity was normalized per μg of protein. B, GADD153 suppressed EGCG-dependent gene expression. Cultured keratinocytes were transfected with 1 μg of pINV-241 and 1 μg of either empty vector or GADD153 expression vector. After 24 h, the cells were treated for 24 h with 40 μm EGCG. After an additional 24 h, the cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. The errors bars represent the S.E. This experiment was repeated three times with similar results. C, cells were transfected in the absence (–) or presence (+) of vector expressing the indicated protein as described above. Total cell extracts were prepared and immunoblotted with antibodies specific for each transcription factor. β-Actin was immunoblotted to assure appropriate loading. Longer exposure revealed the presence of endogenous C/EBPα and C/EBPβ but not C/EBPδ (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The above results suggest that EGCG may control hINV promoter activity by regulating C/EBP factor level. To determine whether EGCG regulates endogenous C/EBP factor levels, nuclear extracts were prepared from keratinocytes after treatment for 24 h with 40 μm EGCG. C/EBP factor levels were then assayed by immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 3A, EGCG treatment substantially increases C/EBPα and C/EBPβ level. C/EBPδ could not be detected. To determine whether the increased C/EBP level correlates with increased C/EBP binding to the hINV promoter C/EBP DNA element, we performed gel mobility shift studies. Cells were treated with vehicle or 40 μm EGCG. After 24 h the cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled C/EBP oligonucleotide (32P-C/EBP). As shown in Fig. 3B, basal protein binding to the hINV C/EBP element is markedly increased following EGCG treatment. Moreover, addition of radioinert competitor oligonucleotide causes a reduction in DNA binding, suggesting that the binding is specific. In addition, this binding is not competed by an unrelated oligonucleotide, Sp1c, that encodes a consensus Sp1 site (11Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Google Scholar).Fig. 3EGCG regulation of C/EBP factor level and DNA binding. A, nuclear extracts were prepared from keratinocytes after treatment for 24 h in the absence (–) or presence (+) of 40 μm EGCG. Equal quantities of protein were electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with a C/EBPα- or C/EBPβ-specific antibody. Binding of the primary antibody was detected by incubation with an anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody with chemiluminescence-dependent visualization. Similar results were obtained in each of three experiments. B, sequence of oligonucleotides used in gel mobility shift experiments (11Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Google Scholar). The C/EBP sequence is derived from the hINV C/EBP site (bold) and flanking regions. C, nuclear extracts (NE) were prepared from near-confluent keratinocyte cultures following treatment for 24 h with (+) or without (–) 40 μm EGCG. Nuclear extracts were then incubated with 32P-labeled C/EBP double-stranded DNA oligomer containing the hINV C/EBP binding site (32P-C/EBP). Specific binding was demonstrated by including a 10- and 100-fold molar excess of homologous competitor oligonucleotide (C/EBP) or Sp1c during the binding reaction. DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a nondenaturing acrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. C/EBP indicates the migration position of the C/EBP oligonucleotide complex, and FP indicates migration of the free probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Curcumin Antagonizes the EGCG-dependent Regulation— The above studies indicate that EGCG increases hINV gene expression, both the endogenous gene and the promoter, and suggest that this increase is dependent upon a functional C/EBP site and also elevated C/EBP levels. We next assessed the role of another antioxidant, curcumin. As shown in Fig. 4, unlike EGCG, curcumin treatment does not increase hINV promoter activity. In addition, incubation of curcumin with EGCG results in inhibition of the EGCG-dependent increase in promoter activity. To assess the concentration dependence of this response, cells were treated with or without an optimal concentration of EGCG (40 μm) and challenged with increasing concentrations of curcumin. As shown in Fig. 5A, curcumin suppresses the EGCG-dependent increase in promoter activity. Complete suppression is observed at curcumin concentrations ≥15 μm. To determine whether the endogenous gene is regulated in a like manner, cells were treated with optimal concentrations of each agent, and involucrin protein level was measured in total cell extracts. Fig. 5B shows that EGCG increases the level of endogenous hINV by 3.3-fold and that this increase is inhibited by curcumin.Fig. 4Curcumin inhibits the EGCG-dependent increase in promoter activity. Human keratinocytes were grown in KSFM until 70% confluent and then transfected with the pINV-241 luciferase reporter construct (9Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Google Scholar). At 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated for 24 h in the presence or absence of 40 μm EGCG and/or 20 μm curcumin. The cells were then harvested for extract preparation and measurement of luciferase activity (28Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Google Scholar).

A, human keratinocytes were grown in KSFM until 70% confluent and then transfected with the pINV-241 luciferase reporter construct (9Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Google Scholar). At 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated for 24 h in the presence or absence of 40 μm EGCG in the presence of increasing curcumin concentration. Promoter activity was monitored by assaying luciferase activity (28Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Google Scholar). The errors bars represent the S.E. (n = 3). B, curcumin inhibits the EGCG-dependent increase in endogenous hINV protein levels. Cells were treated with the indicated concentration of EGCG or curcumin for 24 h, and extracts were prepared to monitor hINV and β-actin levels by immunoblot. The -fold change was determined by laser densitometric scanning after normalizing to the β-actin signal. This experiment is representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Curcumin Inhibits Ras- and MEKK1-dependent Activation of hINV Promoter Activity—Previous studies indicate that EGCG activates a Ras, MEKK1, MEK3, p38δ signaling cascade to increase hINV gene expression (8Balasubramanian S. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1828-1836Google Scholar). As outlined in Fig. 6A, our present studies show that C/EBP factors are a downstream target of this cascade. To identify potential sites of curcumin action in this cascade, hINV promoter activity was activated by kinases positioned at various levels within this cascade, and the effect of curcumin treatment was monitored. Constitutively active Ras (caRas) and wild type MEKK1 (MEKK1) were utilized, as these kinases are known to increase hINV promoter activity (28Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, B and C, treatment with curcumin inhibits both caRas- and MEKK1-dependent promoter activation. This suggests that the site of curcumin action is downstream of these kinases.Fig. 6Curcumin inhibits caRas- and MEKK1-dependent hINV promoter activity. A, EGCG regulates hINV gene expression via a MAPK cascade. B and C, human keratinocytes were grown in KSFM until 70% confluent and then transfected with the 1 μg of pINV-241 luciferase reporter construct (9Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of 1 μg of empty vector (EV) or caRas or MEKK1 expression vector. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated for 24 h in the presence of the indicated concentration of curcumin. The cells were then harvested for extract preparation and measurement of luciferase activity (28Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Google Scholar).

To test this, we monitored the effect of curcumin on the level of endogenous C/EBPα and -β. As shown in Fig. 7A, treatment with EGCG results in an increase in nuclear C/EBPα and C/EBPβ level, and this increase is inhibited by curcumin treatment. As shown in Fig. 7B, the reduction in C/EBP factor level is associated with reduced binding at the hINV promoter C/EBP site.Fig. 7Curcumin inhibits EGCG-dependent increase in the C/EBP factor level and also C/EBPα binding to the hINV promoter C/EBP site. A, cells were treated with EGCG and curcumin for 24 h, and extracts were prepared to monitor C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and β-actin levels by immunoblot. The -fold change was determined by laser densitometric scanning after normalizing to the β-actin signal. This experiment is representative of three separate experiments. B, curcumin reduces EGCG-dependent C/EBP factor binding to hINV promoter C/EBP site. Cells were treated for 24 h with the indicated concentration of EGCG or curcumin. Nuclear extracts (NE) were prepared for gel mobility shift analysis. The left-most lane shows migration of free 32P-C/EBP probe in the absence of nuclear extract. FP and C/EBP indicate migration of the free probe and the C/EBP band, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Proteasome Inhibition Reverses Curcumin-dependent Reduction in C/EBP Factor Level—We next investigated the mechanism of this regulation. Several studies suggest that C/EBP factor level may be regulated by proteasome-dependent mechanisms (29Hungness E.S. Robb B.W. Luo G.J. Pritts T.A. Hershko D.D. Hasselgren P.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To assess the impact of proteasome function on the curcumin-dependent reduction of C/EBPα and -β level, cells were incubated with curcumin in the absence or presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. As shown in Fig. 8, treatment with curcumin results in a reduction in endogenous C/EBPα and C/EBPβ levels. This reduction is reversed by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132.Fig. 8MG132 inhibits the curcumin-dependent reduction in C/EBP factor level. Keratinocytes were incubated in the presence of curcumin and/or MG132 for 24 h prior to preparation of nuclear extracts. Equivalent amounts of nuclear extract were electrophoresed on parallel lanes of a 10% denaturing acrylamide gel and then incubated with anti-C/EBPα or anti-C/EBPβ followed by incubation with an appropriate secondary antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2138675786,"Phospholipase C (PLC) is a ubiquitous enzyme involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes. Its dependence on Ca2+ is well recognized, but it is not known how PLC activity is affected by physiological variations of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Here, we applied evanescent wave microscopy to monitor PLC activity in parallel with [Ca2+]i in individual insulin-secreting INS-1 cells using the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate- and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-binding pleckstrin homology domain from PLCδ1 fused to green fluorescent protein (PHPLCδ1-GFP) and the Ca2+ indicator fura red. In resting cells, PHPLCδ1-GFP was located predominantly at the plasma membrane. Activation of PLC by muscarinic or purinergic receptor stimulation resulted in PHPLCδ1-GFP translocation from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, detected as a decrease in evanescent wave-excited PHPLCδ1-GFP fluorescence. Using this translocation as a measure of PLC activity, we found that depolarization by raising extracellular [K+] triggered activation of the enzyme. This effect could be attributed both to a rise of [Ca2+]i and to depolarization per se, because some translocation persisted during depolarization in a Ca2+-deficient medium containing the Ca2+ chelator EGTA. Moreover, oscillations of [Ca2+]i resulting from depolarization with Ca2+ influx evoked concentration-dependent periodic activation of PLC. We conclude that PLC activity is under tight dynamic control of [Ca2+]i. In insulin-secreting β-cells, this mechanism provides a link between Ca2+ influx and release from intracellular stores that may be important in the regulation of insulin secretion. Phospholipase C (PLC) is a ubiquitous enzyme involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes. Its dependence on Ca2+ is well recognized, but it is not known how PLC activity is affected by physiological variations of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Here, we applied evanescent wave microscopy to monitor PLC activity in parallel with [Ca2+]i in individual insulin-secreting INS-1 cells using the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate- and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-binding pleckstrin homology domain from PLCδ1 fused to green fluorescent protein (PHPLCδ1-GFP) and the Ca2+ indicator fura red. In resting cells, PHPLCδ1-GFP was located predominantly at the plasma membrane. Activation of PLC by muscarinic or purinergic receptor stimulation resulted in PHPLCδ1-GFP translocation from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, detected as a decrease in evanescent wave-excited PHPLCδ1-GFP fluorescence. Using this translocation as a measure of PLC activity, we found that depolarization by raising extracellular [K+] triggered activation of the enzyme. This effect could be attributed both to a rise of [Ca2+]i and to depolarization per se, because some translocation persisted during depolarization in a Ca2+-deficient medium containing the Ca2+ chelator EGTA. Moreover, oscillations of [Ca2+]i resulting from depolarization with Ca2+ influx evoked concentration-dependent periodic activation of PLC. We conclude that PLC activity is under tight dynamic control of [Ca2+]i. In insulin-secreting β-cells, this mechanism provides a link between Ca2+ influx and release from intracellular stores that may be important in the regulation of insulin secretion.

Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4065) Google Scholar). PLC signaling is involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes, including the secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells (2Hellman B. Gylfe E. Grapengiesser E. Lund P.-E. Marcström A. Flatt P.R. Nutrient Regulation of Insulin Secretion. Portland Press, London1992: 213-246Google Scholar, 3Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E409-E416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exocytosis of insulin secretory granules in response to glucose stimulation is the final step in a chain of events starting with the uptake and metabolism of the sugar, which leads to an increase in the cytoplasmic ATP/ADP ratio, closure of KATP channels with membrane depolarization, and Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent channels (4Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). The resulting rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) triggers exocytosis of the insulin-containing granules. The elevation of [Ca2+]i is usually manifested as complex patterns of oscillations, involving periodic depolarization (5Dryselius S. Grapengiesser E. Hellman B. Gylfe E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E512-E518PubMed Google Scholar) as well as intracellular mobilization (6Liu Y.J. Grapengiesser E. Gylfe E. Hellman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. PLC participates in the regulation of insulin secretion by mediating signals from G protein-coupled receptors for various hormones and neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (7Gilon P. Henquin J.C. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 565-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that the second phase of glucose-induced insulin secretion correlates with activation of PLC (3Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E409-E416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enhancement of secretion may be mediated, at least in part, by DAG-induced PKC activation (3Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E409-E416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, 11 isoforms of PLC have been characterized, all of them requiring Ca2+ for activity (8Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Early studies (9Mathias P.C. Best L. Malaisse W.J. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1985; 3: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Best L. Tomlinson S. Hawkins P.T. Downes C.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 927: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 11Biden T.J. Peter-Riesch B. Schlegel W. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3567-3571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of PLC in islets of Langerhans showed that stimulation with depolarizing concentrations of KCl resulted in a significant rise in inositol phosphate generation, indicating that elevation of [Ca2+]i might be sufficient to activate PLC. However, little is known about the kinetics of PLC activation in insulin-secreting cells. In particular, it is unknown whether the depolarization-induced oscillations of [Ca2+]i are associated with periodic activation of PLC with resulting generation of IP3 and release of Ca2+ from internal stores. One of the most widely used methods for measuring PLC activity is labeling cells with myo-[3H]inositol. However, this approach typically provides poor time resolution and no information about the response kinetics in individual cells. It has recently become possible to measure PLC activity in real time in individual living cells using the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain from PLCδ1 fused to green fluorescent protein (PHPLCδ1-GFP) (12Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). This PH domain binds specifically to 4,5-phosphorylated PIP2 and IP3 but only weakly to other phospholipids or inositol polyphosphates (14Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). PHPLCδ1-GFP was introduced to monitor plasma membrane PIP2 concentration during PLC activation with receptor agonists or Ca2+ ionophores (12Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), but was later employed it as a probe for the cytoplasmic IP3 concentration (15Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 16Nash M.S. Young K.W. Willars G.B. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Upon activation of PLC, PHPLCδ1-GFP dissociates from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm, a translocation that can be detected with confocal or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy (17van der Wal J. Habets R. Varnai P. Balla T. Jalink K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15337-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In the present study, we imaged the plasma membrane concentration of PHPLCδ1-GFP by applying evanescent wave microscopy, also known as total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. In this technique, fluorescent molecules are excited with an evanescent wave traveling in a thin layer of ∼100 nm above the interface between a coverslip and the aqueous solution bathing the adherent cells. Hence, fluorescent molecules closely adjacent to the plasma membrane are selectively excited, whereas those in the cell interior are not (18Steyer J.A. Almers W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 19Axelrod D. Traffic. 2001; 2: 764-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Imaging can therefore be made with improved resolution, lower background, and minimal phototoxicity compared with confocal microscopy. We applied this novel approach to monitor PLC activation in individual insulin-secreting INS-1 cells. Simultaneous measurements of PLC activation and [Ca2+]i enabled us to demonstrate that oscillations of [Ca2+]i resulting from periodic influx of the ion are associated with cyclic activation of PLC. Materials—Reagents of analytical grade and deionized water were used. Thapsigargin and the acetoxymethyl esters of the Ca2+ indicators fura-2 and fura red were from Molecular Probes. HEPES was obtained from Roche Applied Science, and Invitrogen provided RPMI 1640 medium and fetal calf serum. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Plasmids encoding the fusion construct between the PH domain of PLCδ1 and GFP (12Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as GFP targeted to the plasma membrane via covalent lipid modifications (20Teruel M.N. Blanpied T.A. Shen K. Augustine G.J. Meyer T. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1999; 93: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Tobias Meyer, Stanford University. Cell Culture and Transfection—Insulin-secreting INS-1 cells (passage 90–120 (21Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar)) were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5.5 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm glutamate, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Following plating onto 25-mm coverslips at a density of 1.5 × 105/ml, the cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA in a ratio of 1:2.5 with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and further cultured for 12–24 h. Fluorescence Microscopy—Before experiments were done, the cells were transferred to a buffer containing 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm HEPES with pH adjusted to 7.40 with NaOH. Where indicated, transfected cells were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fura-2 or fura red by a 30- or 40-min incubation at 37 °C with their acetoxymethyl esters at 1 or 10 μm, respectively. The coverslips were used as exchangeable bottoms of a 50-μl open chamber and superfused with buffer at a rate of 0.3 ml/min. All experiments were performed at 37 °C. [Ca2+]i imaging of fura-2 loaded cells was performed using an epifluorescence imaging system as described previously (22Dyachok O. Tufveson G. Gylfe E. Cell Calcium. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The subcellular distribution of the PHPLCδ1-GFP construct was analyzed using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Odyssey XL, Noran Instruments) equipped with a 60 × 1.40-NA objective (Nikon). Plasma membrane concentrations of the GFP constructs were measured using an evanescent wave microscopy setup built around an Eclipse TE2000 microscope (Nikon). The 488-nm beam of an argon ion laser (Creative Laser Production, Munich, Germany) was homogenized and expanded by a rotating light shaping diffuser (Physical Optics Corp.) and refocused onto the back focal plane of a 60 × 1.45-NA objective (Nikon). The laser beam was moved toward the periphery of the objective aperture until the critical angle was exceeded and total internal reflection occurred. The fluorescence excited by the evanescent field was detected using an Orca-ER camera (Hamamatsu) with a fire-wire interface and MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Selection of emission wavelength was made with interference (525 nm, 25 nm half bandwidth for GFP) and long pass (>630 nm for fura red) filters (Chroma Technology Corp.) mounted in a Lambda 10–2 filter wheel (Sutter Instruments) capable of changing positions within 60 ms. Images (or image pairs) were acquired every 5 s. To minimize exposure of the cells to the potentially harmful laser light, the beam was blocked by an electronic shutter (Sutter Instruments) between image captures. Data Analysis—Image analysis was made with MetaMorph, MetaFluor (Universal Imaging), or ImageJ (W. S. Rasband, National Institutes of Health, rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) software. GFP and fura red fluorescence intensities are expressed as changes relative to initial fluorescence (ΔF/Fo) after subtraction of background. Curve fitting was made with IgorPro software (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). All data are presented as mean values ± S.E. Confocal and Evanescent Wave Microscopy Imaging of PLC Activity—Confocal microscopy of INS-1 cells expressing PHPLCδ1-GFP demonstrated that the fluorescence was distributed predominantly in the plasma membrane under resting conditions. Weaker fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm, but the construct was excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 1, left panels). Activation of PLC by stimulation with the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol at 100 μm (Fig. 1A, right) or the purinergic agonist ATP (Fig. 1B, right) was associated with a pronounced translocation of PHPLCδ1-GFP from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm. We next investigated whether the PHPLCδ1-GFP translocation could be analyzed using evanescent wave microscopy. Fig. 2A shows cells expressing PHPLCδ1-GFP excited with an evanescent wave. A homogenous fluorescence was observed in the plasma membrane adhering to the coverslip. Dissociation of the PHPLCδ1-GFP construct from the plasma membrane upon stimulation with 100 μm carbachol was observed as a decrease in fluorescence, peaking at 27 ± 2% (n = 55) below initial intensity within 30 s (Fig. 2, A and B). In the continued presence of the agonist there was a partial recovery of the fluorescence to a level of 14 ± 1% (n = 55) below initial fluorescence within 2 min and a complete recovery upon removal of the stimulus (Fig. 2B). The drop in plasma membrane fluorescence was dose-dependent with half-maximal effect observed at about 10 μm carbachol (Fig. 2C). To verify that the changes in fluorescence reflected activation of PLC and not alterations in cell adhesion or morphology, we imaged cells expressing GFP targeted to the plasma membrane by a palmitoylation and myristoylation motif (PM-GFP (20Teruel M.N. Blanpied T.A. Shen K. Augustine G.J. Meyer T. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1999; 93: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)). Carbachol at a concentration of 100 μm was without effect on the evanescent wave-excited PM-GFP fluorescence (data not shown). Depolarization and Elevation of [Ca2+]i Activate PLC in Insulin-secreting Cells—Insulin-secreting INS-1 and pancreatic β-cells exhibit voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx upon stimulation with glucose. In INS-1 cells, [Ca2+]i oscillations of varying amplitudes and duration are often observed in the 3–11 mm glucose range (Fig. 3, A and B). These oscillations immediately disappear after removal of extracellular Ca2+ but persist after depletion of ER Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin (Fig. 3, A and B; see also Refs. 23Dorff G. Grapengiesser E. Hellman B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 842-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar and 24Herbst M. Sasse P. Greger R. Yu H. Hescheler J. Ullrich S. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Store depletion after thapsigargin pretreatment was verified by the lack of Ca2+ mobilization in response to 100 μm carbachol. To test whether depolarization and elevation of [Ca2+]i was sufficient to activate PLC in insulin-secreting cells, we challenged INS-1 cells with a high concentration of KCl. Isosmolarity was maintained by equimolar reduction of NaCl. Depolarization with 90 mm KCl resulted in a robust increase of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3C). In PHPLCδ1-GFP-expressing cells, the same stimulation resulted in a pronounced drop of evanescent wave-excited fluorescence (18 ± 1%; n = 51; Fig. 3D). Also in a Ca2+-deficient medium containing 2 mm EGTA, KCl depolarization slightly reduced the PHPLCδ1-GFP fluorescence (8 ± 1%; n = 17; Fig 3E). Reintroduction of Ca2+ to the depolarized cells resulted in a further rapid drop in fluorescence. In contrast, strong depolarization had no effect on PM-GFP fluorescence (data not shown). 90 mm KCl depolarizes the membrane to the levels reached only during short periods of time under physiological conditions. We therefore tested the effect of a lower KCl concentration. At 30 mm KCl, activation of PLC was still detectable in 6 of 15 cells in a Ca2+-deficient medium (3.5 ± 0.7% drop in PHPLCδ1-GFP fluorescence). These data indicate that elevation of [Ca2+]i in a depolarized cell is a strong stimulus for PLC activation and that plasma membrane depolarization per se is sufficient for partial activation of the enzyme. Oscillatory Activation of PLC by Periodic Depolarization and Ca2+ Influx—To investigate whether the influx-dependent [Ca2+]i oscillations may generate oscillatory PLC activation, we simultaneously measured evanescent wave-excited fluorescence from the [Ca2+]i indicator fura red and the PHPLCδ1-GFP probe. Fig. 4A shows such experiments demonstrating that [Ca2+]i oscillations imposed by 3-min pulses of high [K+] repeated with 3-min intervals were paralleled by cyclic activation of PLC (14 ± 1% loss of PHPLCδ1-GFP fluorescence; n = 30 cells). In 11 of 19 cells exhibiting naturally occurring [Ca2+]i oscillations in the presence of 3 or 11 mm glucose, PLC was activated in a periodic manner (6.3 ± 0.8% loss of PHPLCδ1-GFP fluorescence; Fig 4B). Increases of [Ca2+]i coincided with drops in PHPLCδ1-GFP fluorescence. It was ascertained that cross-talk between the channels did not significantly influence the results. Accordingly, spontaneous oscillations in PHPLCδ1-GFP fluorescence were observed in the absence of fura red loading, and intensity oscillations of the Ca2+ indicator were observed also in non-transfected cells. The spontaneously occurring [Ca2+]i oscillations exhibited varying amplitudes (on average 19 ± 2% change in fura red fluorescence, n = 48) and durations (30 ± 4 s width at half-maximum, n = 48). Fig. 4C shows an example of a cell with rapid [Ca2+]i transients of varying amplitude, where only some of the transients resulted in detectable activation of PLC. When the amplitude of each [Ca2+]i oscillation (relative change of fura red fluorescence) was plotted against the degree of PLC activation in the same cell (relative change of PHPLCδ1-GFP fluorescence), a strong correlation was found (r = 0.95; Fig 4D). This finding demonstrates that high amplitude [Ca2+]i transients are the most efficient in activating PLC. In the present study we have introduced a new approach for real-time monitoring of PLC activation dynamics in individual cells. Using evanescent wave microscopy, we have analyzed the membrane association of the PIP2/IP3-binding PH domain from PLCδ1 fused to GFP in parallel with measurements of [Ca2+]i with the fluorescent indicator fura red in insulin-secreting INS-1 cells. The selective excitation of plasma membrane fluorescence in evanescent wave microscopy provides lower background, better signal-to-noise ratio, and minimal photobleaching and phototoxicity compared with other fluorescence microscopy approaches (18Steyer J.A. Almers W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 19Axelrod D. Traffic. 2001; 2: 764-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Moreover, the image analysis is greatly simplified, because plasma membrane association and dissociation of the fluorescent protein can be detected simply as an increase or decrease of overall fluorescence. The translocation kinetics observed in response to the muscarinic M3 receptor agonist carbachol resembled that observed using other microscopy techniques, different cell types, and various G protein-coupled receptor agonists (12Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Varnai P. Balla T. J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It is in debate as to whether PHPLCδ1-GFP translocation in response to PLC activation reflects the drop of membrane PIP2 concentration or whether it is due to binding to the concomitantly formed IP3 (15Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 17van der Wal J. Habets R. Varnai P. Balla T. Jalink K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15337-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Some clarification was recently provided by a combined experimental and modeling study showing that both processes contribute to the dynamics of probe translocation in neuroblastoma cells (25Xu C. Watras J. Loew L.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, a definite distinction between PIP2 and IP3 is not required in order to reach the conclusions drawn about PLC in the present study. INS-1 cells express at least five different isoforms of PLC (PLCβ1, -β2, -β3, -γ1, and -δ2 (26Gasa R. Trinh K.Y. Yu K. Wilkie T.M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). Members of the PLCβ family are activated by heterotrimeric G proteins in response to activation of G protein-coupled receptors, and the PLCγ isoforms are typically activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (8Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Although all isoforms require Ca2+ for activity, the PLCδ family members are the most sensitive (8Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may be regulated directly by [Ca2+]i (27Allen V. Swigart P. Cheung R. Cockcroft S. Katan M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Our finding that depolarization-induced [Ca2+]i elevation triggers PLC activation in INS-1 cells is the first real-time demonstration of this mechanism in individual cells and is consistent with previous studies on islets and clonal insulin-secreting cells using radiotracer techniques (9Mathias P.C. Best L. Malaisse W.J. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1985; 3: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Best L. Tomlinson S. Hawkins P.T. Downes C.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 927: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 11Biden T.J. Peter-Riesch B. Schlegel W. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3567-3571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that depolarization per se activates PLC is also in agreement with previous observations of stimulated IP3 production in β-cells from ob/ob mice (6Liu Y.J. Grapengiesser E. Gylfe E. Hellman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and clonal βTC3 cells (28Gromada J. Frokjaer-Jensen J. Dissing S. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) under conditions in which Ca2+ influx was prevented. In contrast, depolarization was reported to inhibit PLC-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol without effect on PIP2 in rat islets (29Biden T.J. Davison A.G. Prugue M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The different regulation of phosphatidylinositol and PIP2 hydrolysis may reflect the involvement of different PLC isoforms with distinct substrate specificities (30Mitchell C.J. Kelly M.M. Blewitt M. Wilson J.R. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19072-19077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is not known how PLC activity is modulated by membrane potential. Further experiments are required to specify the PLC isozyme(s) responsible for depolarization and Ca2+-induced PIP2 hydrolysis in insulin-secreting cells. The most important finding in our study is that periodic depolarization and Ca2+ influx result in the oscillatory activation of PLC. Via generation of IP3, such oscillations will likely give rise to periodic release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum and thus provide a link between Ca2+ entry and intracellular release. The resulting enhancement of the initial [Ca2+]i elevation by mobilization of the ion from the stores is often referred to as Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. This term is most commonly used to denote the process by which Ca2+ promotes its own release by a direct interaction with the intracellular Ca2+ release channels (31Roderick H.L. Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is possible that Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mediated by IP3 receptors depends, at least in part, on Ca2+-stimulated generation of IP3. Although there is evidence that [Ca2+]i oscillations in β-cells (32Liu Y.J. Grapengiesser E. Gylfe E. Hellman B. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33Liu Y.J. Tengholm A. Grapengiesser E. Hellman B. Gylfe E. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and INS-1 cells (present data and Refs. 23Dorff G. Grapengiesser E. Hellman B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 842-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar and 24Herbst M. Sasse P. Greger R. Yu H. Hescheler J. Ullrich S. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) may occur without involvement of intracellular Ca2+ stores, various observations indicate that release of Ca2+ from the ER influences the dynamics and shaping of the [Ca2+]i oscillations (33Liu Y.J. Tengholm A. Grapengiesser E. Hellman B. Gylfe E. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Fridlyand L.E. Tamarina N. Philipson L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E138-E154Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). IP3-mediated release of Ca2+ from the ER may affect membrane potential and thereby feedback on the voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx. In mouse β-cells, IP3-induced Ca2+ release has been shown to activate a K+ current that contributes to repolarization during action potential firing (5Dryselius S. Grapengiesser E. Hellman B. Gylfe E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E512-E518PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ämmälä C. Larsson O. Berggren P.O. Bokvist K. Juntti-Berggren L. Kindmark H. Rorsman P. Nature. 1991; 353: 849-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Ca2+ release from the ER also results in activation of a depolarizing store-operated current that may be important in the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations (36Worley III, J.F. McIntyre M.S. Spencer B. Mertz R.J. Roe M.W. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14359-14362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Gilon P. Arredouani A. Gailly P. Gromada J. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20197-20205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Oscillations of [Ca2+]i are often observed in INS-1 cells at lower glucose concentrations than in primary β-cells. Despite the possible limitations associated with the use of the INS-1 cell line, it is tempting to believe that depolarization and Ca2+-induced oscillations of PLC activity is not unique to INS-1 cells. Primary β-cells and INS-1 cells exhibit comparable patterns of periodic depolarization and influx of Ca2+. Although the phenomenon still remains to be shown in primary β-cells, we have observed oscillations in PLC activity also in murine insulin-secreting MIN6 cells, which exhibit a glucose sensitivity similar to that of primary β-cells. 2S. Thore and A. Tengholm, unpublished observations. In addition to contributing to the generation and shaping of Ca2+ signals, PLC activation can be anticipated to play a role in regulating the kinetics and magnitude of insulin secretion via generation of DAG and activation of PKC (3Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E409-E416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKCβII has been shown to translocate to the membrane in response to [Ca2+]i oscillations in MIN6 cells (38Pinton P. Tsuboi T. Ainscow E.K. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37702-37710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Generation of DAG could then activate PKC recruited to the membrane during each [Ca2+]i oscillation. The activation of PLC by voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx may therefore result in a tight Ca2+-controlled temporal regulation of PKC substrate phosphorylation important in the regulation of insulin secretion.

https://openalex.org/W2089517263,"High affinity interaction between octameric mitochondrial creatine kinase (MtCK) and the phospholipid cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane plays an important role in metabolite channeling between MtCK and inner membrane adenylate translocator, which itself is tightly bound to cardiolipin. Three C-terminal basic residues revealed as putative cardiolipin anchors in the x-ray structures of MtCK and corresponding to lysines in human sarcomeric MtCK (sMtCK) were exchanged by in vitro mutagenesis (K369A/E, K379Q/A/E, K380Q/A/E) to yield double and triple mutants. sMtCK proteins were bacterially expressed, purified to homogeneity, and verified for structural integrity by enzymatic activity, gel filtration chromatography, and CD spectroscopy. Interaction with cardiolipin and other acidic phospholipids was quantitatively analyzed by light scattering, surface plasmon resonance, and fluorescence spectroscopy. All mutant sMtCKs showed a strong decrease in vesicle cross-linking, membrane affinity, binding capacity, membrane ordering capability, and binding-induced changes in protein structure as compared with wild type. These effects did not depend on the nature of the replacing amino acid but on the number of exchanged lysines. They were moderate for Lys-379/Lys-380 double mutants but pronounced for triple mutants, with a 30-fold lower membrane affinity and an entire lack of alterations in protein structure compared with wild-type sMtCK. However, even triple mutants partially maintained an increased order of cardiolipin-containing membranes. Thus, the three C-terminal lysines determine high affinity sMtCK/cardiolipin interaction and its effects on MtCK structure, whereas low level binding and some effect on membrane fluidity depend on other structural components. These results are discussed in regard to MtCK microcompartments and evolution.

Isoenzymes of creatine kinase (CK) 1The abbreviations used are: CK, creatine kinase; MtCK, mitochondrial CK; sMtCK, sarcomeric MtCK; uMtCK, ubiquitous MtCK; MM-CK, muscle-type CK; ANT, adenylate translocator; CL, cardiolipin; DMPC, dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine; DMPG, dimyristoyl-phosphatidylglycerol; GP, generalized polarization; GPex, excitation-generalized polarization; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-ethanesulfonic acid; WT, wild-type; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; REES, red edge excitation shift; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel. play a key role for energy homeostasis of cells with elevated or alternating energy requirements. Together with high intracellular concentrations of easily diffusible creatine and phosphocreatine, these CK isoenzymes maintain a unique cellular energy buffer and energy transport system, the CK/phosphocreatine-circuit (1Bessman S.P. Carpenter C.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 831-862Google Scholar, 2Wallimann T. Wyss M. Brdiczka D. Nicolay K. Eppenberger H.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 21-40Google Scholar, 3Schlattner U. Forstner M. Eder M. Stachowiak O. Fritz-Wolf K. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 125-140Google Scholar). In most vertebrate tissues, cytosolic dimeric CK is coexpressed with a predominantly octameric mitochondrial isoenzyme (MtCK), sarcomeric MtCK (sMtCK) or ubiquitous uMtCK (2Wallimann T. Wyss M. Brdiczka D. Nicolay K. Eppenberger H.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 21-40Google Scholar). This divergence is an early phylogenetic event since octameric MtCK is already present in the protostome marine worm Chaetopterus variopedatus (4Ellington W.R. Roux K. Pineda Jr., A.O. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 75-78Google Scholar, 5Pineda Jr., A.O. Ellington W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 67-73Google Scholar) and has preserved its sequence through evolution (6Ellington W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 289-325Google Scholar). These facts already point to a specific functional role of the mitochondrial CK octamer. In fact, MtCK is part of proteolipid complexes localized in the cristae and the peripheral intermembrane space of mitochondria (7Beutner G. Ruck A. Riede B. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 7-18Google Scholar, 8Brdiczka D. Beutner G. Ruck A. Dolder M. Wallimann T. Biofactors. 1998; 8: 235-242Google Scholar). These proteolipid complexes form microcompartments that maintain a privileged exchange of substrates and products, the so-called functional coupling (see Fig. 8) (9Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Lennarz W.J. Lane M.D. Encyclopedia of Biological Chemistry. Academic Press, New York2004Google Scholar). ATP from oxidative phosphorylation in the matrix space is exported by adenylate translocator (ANT) in the inner membrane and immediately converted by MtCK to ADP and phosphocreatine. ADP is subsequently reimported into the matrix space via ANT, an obligatory ATP/ADP antiporter, and phosphocreatine is released into the cytosol via mitochondrial porin (or voltage-dependent anion channel, VDAC) in the outer mitochondrial membrane. This intimate exchange of substrates and products, the so-called functional coupling or metabolite channeling (10Saks V.A. Kuznetsov A.V. Kupriyanov V.V. Miceli M.V. Jacobus W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7757-7764Google Scholar, 11Kay L. Nicolay K. Wieringa B. Saks V. Wallimann T. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2000; 208: 119-128Google Scholar): (i) phosphocreatine becomes the high energy intermediate that is exported from mitochondria into the cytosol (3Schlattner U. Forstner M. Eder M. Stachowiak O. Fritz-Wolf K. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 125-140Google Scholar); (ii) locally generated ADP stimulates oxidative phosphorylation (11Kay L. Nicolay K. Wieringa B. Saks V. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6937-6944Google Scholar); and (iii) ADP channeled through the MtCK/ANT interaction inhibits the Ca2+-induced opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (14O'Gorman E. Beutner G. Dolder M. Koretsky A.P. Brdiczka D. Wallimann T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 253-257Google Scholar, 15Dolder M. Walzel B. Speer O. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17760-17766Google Scholar), a well known trigger of apoptosis (16Crompton M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 11-21Google Scholar, 17Halestrap A.P. Doran E. Gillespie J.P. O'Toole A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 170-177Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of uMtCK in many malignant cancers with especially poor prognosis (18Pratt R. Vallis L.M. Lim C.W. Chisnall W.N. Pathology. 1987; 19: 162-165Google Scholar, 19Kornacker M. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Verneris M.R. Negrin R.S. Kornacker B. Staratschek-Jox A. Diehl V. Wolf J. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 513-519Google Scholar) may be related to high energy turnover and failure to eliminate cancer cells via apoptosis. MtCK functions in energy buffering and transport, as well as permeability transition pore regulation may also explain the supportive and protective effects of the CK substrate creatine in many muscular, neurodegenerative, and age-related disorders (20Klivenyi P. Ferrante R.J. Matthews R.T. Bogdanov M.B. Klein A.M. Andreassen O.A. Mueller G. Wermer M. Kaddurah-Daouk R. Beal M.F. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 347-350Google Scholar, 21Matthews R.T. Yang L. Jenkins B.G.

Muller-Felber W. Neurology. 2000; 54: 1848-1850Google Scholar). Thus, microcompartmentation of MtCK and the involved molecular interaction mechanisms are increasingly recognized to be important in human health and disease. Although MtCK has been characterized in quite some detail in vivo and in vitro, the regulation, dynamics, and topology of MtCK-containing microcompartments are far from being understood. Only recently, we provided evidence for a physical interaction between octameric MtCK and VDAC that is enhanced by physiological concentrations of Ca2+ (23Schlattner U. Dolder M. Wallimann T. Tokarska-Schlattner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48027-48030Google Scholar). The latter is characteristic for a lowered cellular energy state and thus of potential regulatory importance. VDAC may be the interaction partner sensing Ca2+ via a recently identified specific binding site (24Gincel D. Zaid H. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 147-155Google Scholar). By contrast, no direct binding of MtCK to ANT has been detected so far. Thus, the known high affinity (Kd <100 nm) of both proteins, MtCK as well as ANT, to the acidic phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) of the inner mitochondrial membrane is of prime importance (25Beyer K. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3821-3826Google Scholar, 26Muller M. Moser R. Cheneval D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3839-3843Google Scholar, 27Rojo M. Hovius R. Demel R.A. Nicolay K. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20290-20295Google Scholar, 28Vacheron M.J. Clottes E. Chautard C. Vial C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 316-324Google Scholar, 29Schlattner U. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17314-17320Google Scholar). It may allow for close co-localization of MtCK and ANT in proteolipid complexes, possibly through CL membrane patches. In support of this, mutations that reduce MtCK membrane binding through destabilization of its octameric structure also reduce creatine-stimulated respiration in cardiomyocyte mitochondria (30Khuchua Z.A. Qin W. Boero J. Cheng J. Payne R.M. Saks V.A. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22990-22996Google Scholar). In fact, it is well known that CL-protein interactions are important not only for activity and structural integrity of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins but also for subunit assembly and supercomplex formation (31Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Google Scholar, 32Lange C. Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6591-6600Google Scholar, 33Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W.

CL (diphosphatidyl glycerol) is unique in having a large dianionic headgroup that consists of three glycerol molecules connected by two phosphodiester linkages with the terminal glycerols bound to four acyl chains via their primary and secondary hydroxyl groups (31Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Google Scholar). Despite the importance of the MtCK-CL interaction for metabolite channeling, the structural components involved in the binding process have remained elusive so far. The x-ray structures of MtCK (35Fritz-Wolf K. Schnyder T. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Nature. 1996; 381: 341-345Google Scholar, 36Eder M. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Proteins. 2000; 39: 216-225Google Scholar) revealed the formerly purported N-terminal CL-binding domain of MtCK (37Cheneval D. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 1-9Google Scholar) to be buried inside the cuboidal octamer, making this domain unlikely to take part in the binding process. On the other hand, based on the molecular structures of both MtCK isoenzymes (35Fritz-Wolf K. Schnyder T. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Nature. 1996; 381: 341-345Google Scholar, 36Eder M. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Proteins. 2000; 39: 216-225Google Scholar), the flexible C-terminal stretches were proposed as putative interaction domains (3Schlattner U. Forstner M. Eder M. Stachowiak O. Fritz-Wolf K. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 125-140Google Scholar, 38Kabsch W. Fritz-Wolf K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 811-818Google Scholar), but no evidence has been provided so far. Here, we set out to test the latter hypothesis by generating point mutants of C-terminal basic residues of human sMtCK and subjecting them to detailed quantitative, biophysical analysis. Light scattering, surface plasmon resonance, and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed the prime importance of three C-terminal lysines for kinetic and equilibrium constants of the sMtCK/phospholipid membrane interaction, as well as for the structural changes that are induced in both interaction partners upon binding (39Granjon T. Vacheron M.J. Vial C. Buchet R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6016-6026Google Scholar). Plasmids and Chemicals—Plasmid pUS01 carrying the gene for human sMtCK between the NdeI and BamHI sites has been described before (40Schlattner U. Eder M. Dolder M. Khuchua Z.A. Strauss A.W. Wallimann T. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1063-1070Google Scholar). Cytosolic rabbit MM-CK was from Roche Applied Science, and laurdan and biotin-X-dihexadecylphosphatidylethanolamine were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). Phospholipids were obtained from Lipid Products for light scattering and Biacore experiments (South Nutfield, UK) or from Sigma for fluorescence experiments. If not mentioned otherwise, all other chemicals were from Sigma/Fluka. Single-site Mutagenesis—Mutation of C-terminal lysines into small, moderately hydrophobic alanine, polar glutamine, or negatively charged glutamate was performed with a convenient modular cloning system, using standard methods (41Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). A plasmid coding for C-terminally truncated human sMtCK (sMtCKΔ369–380, pFLO1) was obtained from pUS01 using inverse polymerase chain reaction as described (36Eder M. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Proteins. 2000; 39: 216-225Google Scholar). pFLO1 contains a new stop codon and unique restriction sites, namely EcoRV by silent mutation of the Ile-368 codon (ATT → ATC) and EcoRI inserted after the new stop codon. Synthetic oligonucleotide linkers coding for mutated C-terminal variants were then cloned in between EcoRI/EcoRV by ligation with a plasmid fragment (EcoRI/NdeI digest of pFLO1) and insert fragment (EcoRV/NdeI digest of pFLO1). The linkers maintained EcoRV and introduced a new unique KpnI site by silent mutation of the Val-370 codon (GTG → GTA), thus allowing us to screen for insert-containing vectors. Mutation of Lys-379/Lys-380 into alanines was initially performed by inverse polymerase chain reaction with mutagenic primers that were 5′-phosphorylated for religation of the linear product. To improve primer hybridization, different codons for alanine were used. All inserts were sequenced according to the chain termination method with an automated system (ABI PRISM 310, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to assure correct in vitro mutagenesis and the absence of random mutations. All utilized oligonucleotide linkers and primers are summarized in Table I.Table IOverview of mutagenic primers Mismatches with the template in the mutagenic primers and nucleotide exchanges as compared with the original sequence in the linkers are marked as bold and underlined. The silent mutations yielding the unique EcoRV and KpnI sites are indicated. Open table in a new tab Protein Expression and Purification—Wild-type (WT) and mutant sMtCK proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified as described in detail elsewhere (36Eder M. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Proteins. 2000; 39: 216-225Google Scholar, 40Schlattner U. Eder M. Dolder M. Khuchua Z.A. Strauss A.W. Wallimann T. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1063-1070Google Scholar). After purification on Blue Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and Resource S ion exchanger, the kinase was over 98% pure as revealed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions were routinely analyzed by standard 12% SDS-PAGE with a minigel apparatus and low Mr markers (Bio-Rad), stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad reagent according to Bradford (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Enzyme Kinetics, Gel Filtration, and CD Spectroscopy—CK enzymatic activity was determined with a photometer using a coupled enzyme assay as described in detail in Schlattner et al. (40Schlattner U. Eder M. Dolder M. Khuchua Z.A. Strauss A.W. Wallimann T. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1063-1070Google Scholar). Briefly, ATP production from phosphocreatine and ADP (reverse reaction) is coupled via hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to NADPH generation. Quantitation of octameric and dimeric sMtCK by gel filtration chromatography was carried out as described in Schlattner and Wallimann (29Schlattner U. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17314-17320Google Scholar). Far-UV (190–250 nm) and near-UV (250–320 nm) CD spectra of sMtCK were recorded on a JASCO J-715 dichrograph (Jasco, Great Dunmow, UK) at 25 °C and under constant nitrogen flow, using a quartz cell with a 1-cm optical path. sMtCK in 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.75) was diluted in this buffer to about 0.2 mg/ml (far-UV) or 0.6 mg/ml (near-UV) and sterile-filtered. Generation of Liposomes—Aliquots of the required lipids in chloroform solution were combined in the desired molar ratio, i.e. pure phosphatidylcholine (PC), PC/CL (10: 1), PC/PE/CL (2:1:1), or DMPC/DMPG (3:2). For fluorescence experiments, the amphiphilic membrane probe laurdan was added in a molar ratio phospholipids/laurdan of 400:1, whereas for Biacore experiments, 0.1% (w/w) biotin-X-dihexadecylphosphatidylethanolamine was incorporated. During liposome preparation, laurdan and laurdan-labeled liposomes were kept in darkness to avoid photobleaching, and all lipids were maintained above the gel to liquid-crystal transition temperature. Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by hydration and a combination of freeze-thawing and extrusion as described previously (28Vacheron M.J. Clottes E. Chautard C. Vial C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 316-324Google Scholar, 43Schlattner U. Wallimann T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 123-131Google Scholar). Briefly, dry lipids were hydrated (5–20 mg/ml) in 10 mm TES, pH 6.5, 50 mm potassium acetate (light scattering and Biacore experiments) or 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA (fluorescence experiments) with subsequent heating to 70 °C when containing laurdan and finally dispersed by vortexing to produce multilamellar vesicles. The lipid suspension was subjected to 6–10 freeze-thaw cycles and then extruded 19 times through polycarbonate membranes (Nucleopore) with 0.4- and then 0.2-μm diameter pores using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). The resulting large unilamellar vesicles have a diameter of ∼150 nm as analyzed by light scattering and electron microscopy and were used within 3 days. Light Scattering and Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy— Light scattering was measured at an angle of 90° using an SPEX fluorolog-2 instrument with a 450-watt xenon arc lamp as a light source as described in Stachowiak et al. (44Stachowiak O. Dolder M. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15522-15528Google Scholar). Intensity was measured using a single photon counter equipped with a Peltier-cooling unit. The wavelength for excitation and detection was 420 nm. All measurements were carried out at 25 °C in a stirred 1-cm quartz cuvette put into a thermostated sample holder. 50 μg of biotin-free vesicles and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol were added to standard buffer (10 mm TES, pH 6.5, 50 mm potassium acetate, pH 6.5) and preincubated for at least 15 min to achieve a constant scattering signal. Vesicle cross-linking was induced by the addition of 30 nm sMtCK and followed for 1000 s. Data were normalized to the scattering signal just after the addition of sMtCK. Binding of sMtCK to a model lipid membrane was measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with a Biacore 2000™ instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) according to Schlattner and Wallimann (29Schlattner U. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17314-17320Google Scholar, 43Schlattner U. Wallimann T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 123-131Google Scholar), using standard buffer with 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Briefly, a carboxymethyl sensorchip CM5 (Biacore) was covered with 20000 response units of avidin to immobilize 800–1000 response units of biotinylated liposomes. sMtCK-membrane association and dissociation kinetics were recorded at 25 °C and a flow rate of 0.3 ml h-1 with sMtCK concentrations ranging from 30 to 300 nm and a final injection of 0.5% SDS to recover the chip-avidin surface. Kinetic data were corrected for background binding to the chip surface by subtracting the signal for pure PC liposomes. Parts of the kinetics unlikely to be influenced by refractive index changes, mass transport, or rebinding effects (43Schlattner U. Wallimann T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 123-131Google Scholar) were fitted with a double exponential, integrated rate equation. This model corresponds to a heterologous interaction comprising two independent binding sites (for a detailed discussion, see Ref. 43Schlattner U. Wallimann T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 123-131Google Scholar). Only fits with residuals smaller than 1% of the response unit signal were retained to determine rate constants and equilibrium response Req. The affinity KD (dissociation equilibrium constant) was derived from rate constants as KD = koff/kon and independently from the slope of a plot Req/c versus c, analogous to a Scatchard plot. Data are given as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) of at least three data sets of different experiments. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence measurements of laurdan and endogenous tryptophan residues in sMtCK were done as described in Granjon et al. (39Granjon T. Vacheron M.J. Vial C. Buchet R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6016-6026Google Scholar). Laurdan measurements were performed with a Hitachi F4500 fluorometer. The excitation and emission band-pass values were 2.5 and 5 nm, respectively. All fluorescence spectra were corrected for spectra of the buffer solution containing liposomes without laurdan. The samples were stirred, and the temperature was controlled with a water thermostated bath. Laurdan emission spectra were recorded at 37 °C for DMPC/DMPG liposomes or 32 °C for PC/PE/CL liposomes by using a 355-nm excitation wavelength and either 60 μg of laurdan-liposomes or 60 μg of laurdan-liposomes in the presence of 60 μg of protein at a 500:1 phospholipids/protein molar ratio for DMPC/DMPG and 360:1 for PC/PE/CL. The final volume was adjusted to 800 μl with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol. The excitation-generalized polarization (GPex) spectra were constructed by calculating the GP value for each emission wavelength as GPex = (I440 - I490)/(I440 + I490) according to Parasassi et al. (45Parasassi T. De Stasio G. Ravagnan G. Rusch R.M. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1990; 60: 179-189Google Scholar), where I440 and I490 are the emission intensities at each excitation wavelength. The choice of the emission wavelengths for the calculation of GP values was based on the characteristic emission wavelengths of pure gel and liquid-crystalline phases. Endogenous tryptophan fluorescence measurements by red edge excitation shift (REES) were performed with a Spex Fluorolog fluorometer. Crossed polarizers were used to minimize the signal due to the diffusion (46Ladokhin A.S. Jayasinghe S. White S.H. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 235-245Google Scholar). Excitation and emission band-pass values were 2 and 3 nm, respectively. Emission spectra were recorded 20 min after the addition of CK to the liposomes, using a 0.4 × 1 cm cuvette at 25 °C. The assays were carried out using 60 μg of protein in 800 μl of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, in the presence or absence of 60 μg of DMPC/DMPG or PC/PE/CL liposomes. The maximum emission wavelength was measured by using excitation wavelengths ranging from 275 to 307 nm. Mutant Design—As already suggested earlier, the C-terminal stretches of the cuboidal MtCK octamers are prime candidates for membrane interaction (3Schlattner U. Forstner M. Eder M. Stachowiak O. Fritz-Wolf K. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 125-140Google Scholar, 35Fritz-Wolf K. Schnyder T. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Nature. 1996; 381: 341-345Google Scholar). As we could show by solving the x-ray structures of sMtCK and uMtCK isoenzymes (35Fritz-Wolf K. Schnyder T. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Nature. 1996; 381: 341-345Google Scholar, 36Eder M. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Proteins. 2000; 39: 216-225Google Scholar), there are four well exposed but poorly ordered C-terminal stretches at both of the opposite, 4-fold symmetric faces of the octamer (Fig. 1A, “top” and “bottom” faces). Mainly, these faces were found attached to phospholipid membranes when analyzed by electron microscopy (47Schnyder T. Cyrklaff M. Fuchs K. Wallimann T. J. Struct. Biol. 1994; 112: 136-147Google Scholar). The very C-terminal stretch of vertebrate MtCK contains three basic residues, the side chains of which protrude from the putative membrane binding face (Fig. 1B) and which are largely conserved among vertebrate MtCK but not in cytosolic CK isoenzymes (Fig. 1C). In human sMtCK, these basic amino acid residues correspond to Lys-369, Lys-379, and Lys-380. To analyze their role in membrane binding, we have replaced both terminal positive charges (Lys-379/Lys-380) alone or in combination with the third lysine (Lys-369/Lys-379/Lys-380), with polar glutamine (sMtCK-kqq, lowercase letters for residues at positions 369, 379, and 380), moderately hydrophobic alanine (sMtCK-kaa, sMtCK-aaa), or negatively charged glutamate (sMtCK-kee, sMtCK-eee). The different replacement mutants should allow us to titrate C-terminal charges from positive to neutral (hydrophobic) and negative and to identify non-specific effects possibly occurring with individual replacement mutants. However, glutamine and glutamate with a size close to lysine are not expected to introduce steric hindrance or to otherwise affect C-terminal structure. Generation and Integrity of Mutant sMtCK—Single-site mutations of C-terminal lysines were generated by using designed synthetic inserts (except for sMtCK-kqq). Human sMtCK WT and mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified by a two-step chromatographic protocol (40Schlattner U. Eder M. Dolder M. Khuchua Z.A. Strauss A.W. Wallimann T. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1063-1070Google Scholar) to over 98% purity as judged by SDS-PAGE (data not shown; see “Experimental Procedures”). All purified mutant proteins remained soluble and enzymatically active after storage at 4 °C, suggesting that stability and proper folding were not significantly affected by the mutations described. Structural and functional integrity were analyzed in more detail by enzyme activity assays, CD spectroscopy, and analytical gel filtration chromatography. All mutant proteins showed specific enzyme activities that were, within error, identical to wild type (Table II). Far-UV CD spectra of mutants were superimposable to those of wild-type enzyme, confirming the overall structural integrity (Fig. 2A). In the near-UV range (≥240 nm, Fig. 2B), the three Cotton bands (minima at ∼280, 290, and 300 nm) characteristic for sMtCK (48Gross M. Furter-Graves E.M. Wallimann T. Eppenberger H.M. Furter R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1058-1068Google Scholar) were conserved in all mutant proteins. The octamer/dimer ratio of mutant proteins determined by gel filtration chromatography was even slightly higher than with wild type, providing clear evidence for preservation of the oligomeric state (Fig. 3).Table IISpecific enz"
https://openalex.org/W1967287081,"Clinical isolates of Neisseria meningitidis produce a repeat in toxin (RTX) protein, FrpC, of unknown biological activity. Here we show that physiological concentrations of calcium ions induce a novel type of autocatalytic cleavage of the peptide bond between residues Asp414 and Pro415 of FrpC that is insensitive to inhibitors of serine, cysteine, aspartate, and metalloproteases. Moreover, as a result of processing, the newly generated amino-terminal fragment of FrpC can be covalently linked to another protein molecule by a novel type of Asp-Lys isopeptide bond that forms between the carboxyl group of its carboxyl-terminal Asp414 residue and the ϵ-amino group of an internal lysine of another FrpC molecule. Point substitutions of negatively charged residues possibly involved in calcium binding (D499K, D510A, D521K, and E532A) dramatically reduced the self-processing activity of FrpC. The segment necessary and sufficient for FrpC processing was localized by deletion mutagenesis within residues 400–657, and sequences homologous to this segment were identified in several other RTX proteins. The same type of calcium-dependent processing and cross-linking activity was observed also for the purified ApxIVA protein of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. These results define a protein cleavage and cross-linking module of a new class of RTX proteins of Gram-negative pathogens of man, animals, and plants.

Invasive infections by Neisseria meningitidis still belong to the most common causes of epidemic bacterial meningitis. Meningococci colonize the upper respiratory tract of about 10% of healthy asymptomatic carriers. Occasionally, however, the bacteria can penetrate across the mucosal barrier, invade the bloodstream, and pass the blood-brain barrier, causing lifethreatening septicemia and/or meningitis. Many potential virulence factors involved in meningococcal pathogenesis have been studied in substantial detail over the past few decades. These comprise the polysaccharide capsule, adhesins like pili, Opa and Opc proteins, and the iron acquisition systems, respectively (1Hauck C.R. Meyer T.F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2Merz A.J. So M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 423-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 3Schryvers A.B.

In contrast to a number of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, no proteinaceous exotoxins have yet been implicated in the pathogenesis of invasive meningococcal disease. In 1993, however, Thompson and colleagues (6Thompson S.A. Wang L.L. Sparling P.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Thompson S.A. Wang L.L. West A.

A number of RTX proteins have been shown to be involved in virulence of other Gram-negative genera, such as Actinobacillus, Bordetella, Escherichia, Moraxella, Morganella, Pasteurella, Proteus, and Vibrio (8Lally E.T. Hill R.B. Kieba I.R. Korostoff J. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 356-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 9Welch R.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 257: 85-111PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study, we have shown that genes encoding FrpC-like proteins of variable size are present in most clinical isolates of N. meningitidis and that sera of a majority of patients who had invasive meningococcal disease contain antibodies specifically recognizing these proteins (10Osicka R. Kalmusova J. Krizova P. Sebo P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although the biological activity of FrpC-like proteins remains unknown, the findings suggested that it might be contributing to meningococcal carriage and/or disease. We report here that the FrpC protein exhibits a novel type of “clip-and-link” self-processing activity. It is shown that FrpC undergoes a unique calcium-dependent autocatalytic processing at an Asp-Pro peptide bond that is accompanied by formation of high molecular weight oligomeric species of FrpC that contain subunits covalently cross-linked through a new type of isopeptide bond. The same type of calcium-dependent processing activity is demonstrated also for another RTX protein of unknown role in infections by Actinobacillus that also contains the novel protein cleavage and cross-linking module. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The Escherichia coli K12 strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene), used throughout this work for DNA manipulation, was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 150 μg of ampicillin/ml. Meningococci were grown on GCB medium (Difco) plates at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For analysis of FrpC processing in N. meningitidis, the wild type N. meningitidis strain MC58 and its previously described isogenic deletion variants ΔNMB0585 (lacking the frpC-like allele), ΔNMB1415 (lacking the frpC allele), and the double mutant (lacking both frpC-like and frpC alleles) were used (11Forman S. Linhartova I. Osicka R. Nassif X. Sebo P. Pelicic V. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2253-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Plasmids—The plasmid pTYB2N-FLAGfrpC was used for production of the FrpC protein tagged at its amino terminus with an artificial FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) inserted as a double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide encoding the FLAG epitope (5′-TATGGATTATAAAGATGACGATGACAAATCAACGCG-3′ annealed with 5′-TACGCGTTGATTTGTCATCGTCATCTTTATAATCCA-3′) into the NdeI site of pTYB2frpC (10Osicka R. Kalmusova J. Krizova P. Sebo P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The pTYB2frpCΔrtx construct was derived from pTYB2N-FLAGfrpC and was used for production of the truncated FrpCΔRTX protein lacking the 967 carboxyl-terminal residues of the RTX domain. FrpCΔRTX was tagged at the amino terminus by the FLAG peptide and at the carboxyl terminus by a His6 affinity purification tag. pJFFapxIVA1HisC′ was used for production of the recombinant carboxyl-terminally His-tailed ApxIVA protein in E. coli (12Schaller A. Kuhn R. Kuhnert P. Nicolet J. Anderson T.J. MacInnes J.I. Segers R.P. Frey J. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2105-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and was generously provided by J. Frey from the University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland. Deletion and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Deletions within the frpCΔrtx allele were obtained by PCR mutagenesis and/or by using the naturally occurring restriction sites in frpC to introduce in-frame deletions and insertions of suitable synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors. The constructions were called pTYB2frpCΔrtxΔX–Y where X and Y stand for the first and the last amino acid residues of the polypeptide segment that was deleted in the corresponding protein construct (e.g. the used X–Y deletions were 1–199, 200–397, 400–448, 659–862, 451–657, 451–562, and 564–657, respectively). Amino acid substitutions were introduced by site-directed PCR mutagenesis using the proofreading Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and suitable pairs of mutagenic PCR primers. The PCR products with introduced substitutions were examined for the absence of other undesired mutations by DNA sequencing and introduced into the pTYB2frpCΔrtx. Complete sequences and detailed schemes of the plasmid constructs will be provided upon request. Production and Purification of the FrpC-derived Proteins—The different FrpC-derived constructs were produced in the E. coli strain BL21(λ DE3) transformed with the appropriate plasmid. Exponential 500-ml cultures grown at 30 °C in LB medium with 150 μg of ampicillin/ml were induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) for 4 h. The cells were washed twice in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl (TN buffer), 5 mm EDTA, resuspended in TN buffer containing 1 mm EDTA (EDTA buffer), and disrupted by sonication. For protein purification by chitin affinity chromatography, the cell extract was cleared at 20,000 × g for 20 min and loaded on a chitin bead column (New England Biolabs) in the EDTA buffer. After washing, buffered 50 mm dithiothreitol was loaded on the column to promote self-excision of the intein-CBD from the fusion protein during overnight incubation at 4 °C. The given FrpC-derived protein was then eluted by restoring buffer flow through the column. In the final step, dithiothreitol was removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 in EDTA buffer. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Production and Purification of ApxIVA—Recombinant ApxIVA was produced from the pJFFapxIVA1HisC′ plasmid in isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced (1 mm) exponential cultures of E. coli BL21(λ DE3) at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice in TN buffer with 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and disrupted by sonication. ApxIVA was extracted from insoluble cell debris by 8 m urea in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) and loaded on DEAE-Sepharose. The urea concentration was decreased using a step gradient, and the column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl (pH 8.0). ApxIVA was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) and further purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). Imidazole was removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 in EDTA buffer. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed according to standard protocols (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, probed by the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (at a 1:3,000 dilution) or the anti-RTX monoclonal antibody 9D4 (at 1:5,000 dilution), and revealed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3,000) using the chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Amino-terminal Sequencing—Amino-terminal sequences of proteins electroblotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were determined according to standard protocols using the automated protein sequencing system Procise (Applied Biosystems). In Vitro Calcium-dependent Processing—The concentrations of free calcium ions were adjusted in the reaction mixtures within the range of 100 nm–9.2 mm by a Ca2+-EDTA buffering system based on calculations using WEBMAXC 2.10 software. 2See www.stanford.edu/∼cpatton/webmaxcS.htm. Unless indicated otherwise, processing was initiated by addition of CaCl2 to adjust free Ca2+ to 2 mm and allowed to proceed for 5 min at 37 °C before the reaction was stopped by mixing the sample with SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 10 mm EDTA to titrate out free calcium ions. In unprocessed controls, calcium addition was omitted, and the purified proteins were incubated in EDTA buffer under otherwise identical conditions. For determination of the pH optimum, acetate buffer was used in the pH range 4.0–5.5, Bis-Tris Propane buffer was used for pH 6.0–9.5, and CABS buffer was used for pH 10.5–11.5. The FrpCΔRTX aliquots were supplemented with 100 mm buffer prior to initiation of processing by addition of calcium. The final pH of each reaction was determined using 100 times larger volumes of the same solutions. FrpC Processing in N. meningitidis—N. meningitidis strains MC58, ΔNMB0585 (ΔfrpC-like), ΔNMB1415 (ΔfrpC), and the “double mutant” (11Forman S. Linhartova I. Osicka R. Nassif X. Sebo P. Pelicic V. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2253-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were grown on GCB plates at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 for 12 h. Bacteria were harvested, washed in RPMI 1640 medium and inoculated to A600 = 0.02 into fresh medium. Expression of the frpC and frpC-like genes was induced by addition of the iron chelator desferrioxamine to 100 μm. Where applicable, 0.4 mm EGTA was added to chelate the calcium ions present in the RPMI 1640 medium (∼0.42 mm). After 10 h of growth, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and the secreted proteins were precipitated from culture supernatants with acetone; dissolved in 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 150 mm NaCl; separated by SDS-PAGE (acrylamide, 7.5%); and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The Frp proteins were detected by Western blots with the anti-RTX monoclonal antibody 9D4 (at 1:3,000 dilution). Densitometric Analysis—Coomassie-stained 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were digitalized using the PDI 420oe scanner and the program PDQuest software (PDI Inc.). Images were analyzed using AIDA two-dimensional densitometry software version 2.11 (Raytest). The extent of calcium-induced cleavage was calculated using the equation (U–P)/U (%) where U is the integrated signal intensity of the unprocessed FrpCΔRTX band in the negative control and P is the integrated signal intensity of the unprocessed FrpCΔRTX band remaining in the processed protein sample. The integrated signal intensity of the gel background was subtracted from both values. The experiments were repeated four times, and the given values represent the average ± S.D. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—Twenty-four individual protein bands per analyzed higher molecular weight protein species were excised from Coomassie R-250-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gel slices were pooled, chopped, and destained as described elsewhere (14Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). In-gel protein digestions were carried out with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, 50 ng/μl) overnight at 37 °C. The generated peptides were extracted with 40% MeCN, 0.5% acetic acid; dried; and reconstituted into 5% MeCN, 0.5% acetic acid prior to separation on a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column (Smart System, Amersham Biosciences) in a linear gradient of MeCN in 0.5% acetic acid. The fractionated peptides were dried and reconstituted in 20 μl of 5% MeCN, 0.3% acetic prior to analysis by mass spectrometry. For esterification, 5 μl of the peptide mixture was dried and reconstituted in 20 μl of a 4:21 acetylchloride:absolute ethanol mixture. After 3 h of incubation at room temperature the mixture was dried and reconstituted with 10 μl of 30% MeCN, 0.3% acetic acid. Mass spectra were acquired using the MALDI-TOF spectrometer BIFLEX II (Bruker-Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm) and gridless delayed extraction ion source. Ion acceleration voltage was 19 kV, and the reflectron voltage was set to 20 kV. Spectra were calibrated externally using the monoisotopic [M + H]+ ion of the peptide standard somatostatin (Sigma). A saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% MeCN, 0.3% acetic acid was used as the MALDI matrix. 1 μl of the sample was mixed with 1 μl of matrix solution on the target, and the droplet was allowed to dry at ambient temperature. Conventional MALDI mass spectra were correlated with theoretical proteolytic peptide maps. The protonated molecules of selected suspect peptides were subjected to postsource decay (PSD) analyses, and the obtained spectra were manually interpreted. Calcium Ions Induce a Unique Processing of FrpC at an Asp-Pro Peptide Bond and Formation of Extremely Stable Higher Molecular Weight Forms of FrpC—While purifying the recombinant FrpC protein, we were unable to separate the full-length FrpC (∼198 kDa) from its ∼150-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment formed during production in E. coli (10Osicka R. Kalmusova J. Krizova P. Sebo P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It was, however, noted that the ∼150-kDa fragment was more abundant when the chelating agent EDTA was omitted from purification buffers. As shown in Fig. 1, when the purified FrpC protein was incubated for 1 h with 2 mm Ca2+ ions instead of 1 mm EDTA, it was almost completely cleaved to the ∼150-kDa carboxyl-terminal and ∼45-kDa amino-terminal fragments. More surprisingly, besides the FrpC fragments, several higher molecular weight forms of FrpC also formed during the calcium-induced processing (Fig. 1B, lanes 2, 4, and 6). These higher molecular weight forms were recognized both by the 9D4 anti-RTX monoclonal antibody recognizing the carboxyl-terminal part of FrpC as well as by the anti-FLAG M2 antibody targeting an amino-terminal FLAG tag in the FrpC construct used. This suggested that upon calcium-induced cleavage, the FrpC protein could form oligomers that were not dissociated under the strongly denaturing conditions of sample preparation for SDS-PAGE. Furthermore neither the calcium-dependent FrpC cleavage activity nor its capacity to form higher molecular weight oligomers could be removed by various rather vigorous purification schemes. These comprised both native and denaturing conditions (e.g. 8 m urea solutions) and different combinations of up to three chromatographic steps, such as affinity purification of His6-tagged FrpC on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and/or chitin affinity purification of the intein-CBD-tagged FrpC, ion-exchange, and hydrophobic chromatographies, respectively (data not shown). This strongly suggested that the calcium-dependent cleavage and higher molecular weight formation activities were catalyzed by the FrpC protein itself and not by a contaminating E. coli component. The latter possibility was rather unlikely since no calcium-dependent protein processing activity has been reported for E. coli. To characterize this activity of FrpC, the amino-terminal sequence was determined for the newly generated FrpC fragment resulting from calcium-induced processing and compared with the sequence of the co-purifying ∼150-kDa FrpC fragment formed in E. coli that was incubated in 1 mm EDTA. Unexpectedly, while the co-purifying fragment exhibited amino-terminal sequence FAPWVKE corresponding to cleavage between residues Cys395 and Phe396, a single and different amino-terminal sequence of PLALDL was found for the ∼150-kDa fragment generated by in vitro processing induced by 2 mm calcium ions. Hence both the full-length FrpC and its co-purifying fragment were processed at a novel site between residues Asp414 and Pro415. This cleavage, however, shortened the co-purifying fragment (starting at Phe396, molecular mass = 153.5 kDa) by only 2.3 kDa to the processed fragment (starting at Asp414, molecular mass = 151.2 kDa), and the two different fragments could not be resolved by SDS-PAGE. To facilitate a more detailed analysis of processing and oligomerization of FrpC, a truncated FrpCΔRTX construct, lacking the entire RTX carboxyl-terminal domain and consisting of only the first 862 residues of FrpC, was prepared. It was further fused to a self-excisable chitin affinity tag to allow purification on chitin beads. As documented in Fig. 2, again a carboxyl-terminal fragment (∼50 kDa) with the amino-terminal sequence FAPWVKETK was co-purified with FrpCΔRTX (∼95 kDa). As further shown in Fig. 2, in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+ the FrpCΔRTX protein was also fully competent for processing and oligomerization, yielding an expected ∼45-kDa amino-terminal fragment, several higher molecular weight forms, and a newly generated carboxyl-terminal fragment exhibiting the expected amino-terminal sequence of PLALDLDGDG. This latter fragment could now be resolved by SDS-PAGE from the co-purifying fragment of FrpCΔRTX (starting at Phe396), and the two fragments could be quantified separately. Moreover the size of the higher molecular mass products of FrpCΔRTX generated during processing also fell into a range allowing their better separation by SDS-PAGE (115–200 kDa). The FrpCΔRTX construct was, therefore, further used for detailed characterization of the calcium-induced processing of FrpC. Substitutions of the Asp414 and Pro415 Residues at the Processing Site Block the Calcium-induced Cleavage and Oligomerization of FrpC—To analyze the sequence specificity of FrpC processing, three individual substitutions disrupting the Asp-Pro cleavage site were constructed. Asp414 was replaced by alanine (D414A) or glutamate (D414E) residues, and Pro415 was substituted by alanine (P415A). As shown in Fig. 3, the substitutions of both Asp414 and Pro415 residues by an alanine abolished the calcium-dependent processing, while only a moderate reduction in the rate of FrpCΔRTX processing was observed upon substitution of Asp414 by a Glu residue. Furthermore production of higher molecular weight forms could be observed also with the D414E variant. This shows that the processing activity of FrpC requires the presence of an acidic residue at position 414. Characteristics of the Calcium-dependent Processing Reaction—To further analyze the calcium-dependent cleavage of FrpC, the kinetics, pH and temperature dependence, and the selectivity of the processing activity for divalent cations were determined. The processing products of FrpCΔRTX formed under various conditions were separated by SDS-PAGE and quantified by densitometric analysis of Coomassie-stained gels. As shown in Fig. 4, addition of 2 mm free calcium ions resulted in rapid FrpCΔRTX processing with a reaction half-time of about 5 min under the given conditions, and maximal conversion of about 85% was reached within 30 min. The temperature optimum of the processing reaction ranged between 35 °C and 45 °C (Fig. 5A), and a rather broad optimal pH range between 5.5 and 8.5 was found (Fig. 5B). The calcium dependence of FrpC processing was further studied using a series of free calcium ion concentrations adjusted between 100 nm and 9.2 mm by a Ca2+-EDTA buffering system (WEBMAXC 2.10).2 As shown in Fig. 5C, cleavage of FrpCΔRTX was induced by concentrations of free Ca2+ ions higher than 100 μm, and the processing rate continued to increase with rising Ca2+ concentrations up to the yield of about 80% FrpCΔRTX conversion in 5 min at 9.2 mm Ca2+. As further shown in Fig. 5D, other divalent cations, such as Zn2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, or Cu2+ of which some can be found as essential active site ions of metalloproteases, did not significantly influence the cleavage of FrpC. Among the seven tested divalent cations only cadmium could replace calcium and induced FrpCΔRTX processing at about half the rate induced by equal Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 5D).Fig. 5Dependence of processing on temperature, pH, calcium ion concentration, and presence of divalent cations. A, FrpCΔRTX was incubated at the different temperatures for 5 min in the presence of 2 mm free calcium ions at pH 7.4. B, FrpCΔRTX was incubated at the different pH values for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm calcium ions. C, FrpCΔRTX was incubated with 100 nm–10 mm concentrations of calcium ions for 5 min at 37 °C and pH 7.4. D, FrpCΔRTX was incubated in the presence of 2 mm concentrations of the indicated divalent metal cations for 5 min at 37 °C and pH 7.4. Aliquots of the processed protein were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5%) and stained with Coomassie Blue. Extent of cleavage of FrpCΔRTX was quantified by densitometric analysis of SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the values represent an average of four determinations ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Calcium-dependent Processing of FrpC Is Not Blocked by an Array of Prototype Protease Inhibitors—To get more information on the possible catalytic mechanism of FrpC processing, an array of typical inhibitors of all classes of conventional proteases was tested. However, as shown in Fig. 6, none of the inhibitors of serine proteases (e.g. antipain, aprotinin, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride (TLCK), and l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)), of cysteine proteases (e.g. leupeptin, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, TLCK, TPCK, and N-(N-(l-3-trans-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl)-l-leucyl)agmatine (E-64)), and aspartic proteases (pepstatin), respectively, could inhibit the cleavage of FrpCΔRTX when used at the recommended or 10 times higher than usual concentrations (Fig. 6). The cleavage activity was neither inhibited by phosphoramidon, 1,10-phenanthroline, and 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid, inhibitors of metalloproteases, nor was it blocked by bestatin, a typical inhibitor of aminopeptidases (Fig. 6). The Processing Activity of FrpC Resides within the Segment Delimited by Residues 400–657—To identify the domain of FrpC accounting for the Asp414-Pro415 bond cleavage, a set of further truncated constructs was derived from FrpCΔRTX (Fig. 7A) and examined for processing activity. As shown in Fig. 7B, neither large deletions within the 397 amino-terminal residues of FrpC nor removal of the 204 carboxyl-terminal residues of FrpCΔRTX had any effect on the calcium-dependent processing activity. This was, however, ablated by deletion of the segment between residues 451 and 657 and/or by two shorter deletions within this segment comprising residues 451–562 and 564–657, respectively (Fig. 7). As expected, deletion of the processing site between residues 400 and 448 also abolished FrpCΔRTX processing. The minimal FrpC segment accounting for the calcium-dependent processing of the Asp414-Pro415 bond was, thereby, delimited by residues 400–657. Point Substitutions of Residues Potentially Involved in Binding of Calcium Ions Abolish FrpC Processing—Extensive screening of the self-processing segment of FrpC (residues 400–657) for the consensus sequence motifs of a wide range of known proteases and proteins undergoing autocatalytic cleavage failed to yield any useful hits (Network Protein Sequence @nalysis, Institut de Biologie et Chimie des Protéines, Lyon, France). Since histidine residues are frequently involved in catalysis of peptide bond cleavage by other proteases, we examined whether any of the five histidine residues comprised within the processing segment of FrpC could play a role in its activity. However, individual substitutions of these histidine residues had no (H411L, H588A, and H651L) or very minor effect (H440V and H490L) on the rate of the calcium-induced processing as documented in Fig. 8. In contrast to the missing protease signature motifs, however, the sequence comparisons of the processing segment revealed the presence of five potential calcium binding sequences, which exhibited various degrees of homology to the well defined EF-hand motif (Table I). Of these sequences, two exhibited a particularly high homology (residues 499–511 and 521–533) and had conserved all the key residues involved in calcium ion coordination to the EF-hand consensus sites. Four of these residues were, therefore, individually replaced. As further shown in Fig. 8, single substitution of the Asp499 residue by the oppositely charged lysine residue (D499K) and/or substitutions of the Asp510 and Glu532 residues by the neutral alanine residues (D510A and E532A) significantly reduced the rate of FrpCΔ"

Studies on a rat breast cancer model indicate that human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone that is present in very high levels during pregnancy, could be responsible for this decrease. These findings, as well as those demonstrating the presence of functional luteinizing hormone (LH)/hCG receptors in human breast cells, prompted us to investigate the anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects of hCG in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells by down-regulating NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with highly purified hCG resulted in a modest dose-dependent and hormone-specific decrease in cell proliferation. hCG treatment also decreased cell invasion, which was more dramatic than the decrease in cell proliferation. These hCG actions were abrogated when receptor synthesis was inhibited by treatment with antisense hCG/LH receptor phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide. hCG treatment prevented the tumor necrosis factor-dependent NF-κB and AP-1 activation, which paralleled a decrease in the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. The findings that hCG treatment increased cAMP synthesis and activated cAMP-dependent protein kinase, dibutyryl cAMP mimicked hCG in preventing NF-κB activation, and dideoxyadenosine, an adenylate cyclase inhibitor, prevented the hCG effect on NF-κB suggested that the hCG actions are mediated via the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A signaling pathway. In summary, our results demonstrate that hCG has anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects in MCF-7 cells by down-regulating NF-κB and AP-1.

Teicher B.A. Drug Resistance in Oncology. Marcel Dekker, New York1993: 537-560Google Scholar), suggest that hCG may have a direct role in breast cancer protection. Since it is not practical to investigate anti-breast cancer effects of hCG in women and due to limitations in obtaining normal human breast epithelial cells or cells in primary breast cancer lesions, we used MCF-7 cells, which were first isolated from pleural effusion of a 69-year-old woman who had breast adenocarcinoma (35Soule H.D. Vazquez J. Long A. Albert S. Brennan M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). These cells retained several characteristics of differentiated mammary epithelium and have been extensively used in breast cancer research. Thus, this cell line is a reasonable choice to test our hypothesis that hCG has anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects via possibly down-regulating the activation of NF-κB and AP-1. Materials—The following items were obtained: highly purified hCG (CR-127; 14,900 IU/mg), human follicle-stimulating hormone (AFP-87929B, 1,683 IU/mg), human LH (AFP-0264B, 4,015 IU/mg), human thyroid-stimulating hormone (AFP-4314C, 15 IU/mg), α (CR-125) and β (CR-125; 29 IU/mg) subunits of hCG from the NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, National Hormone and Pituitary Program and Dr. A. F. Parlow, Torrance, CA; polyclonal hCG/LH receptor antibody raised in rabbits against a synthetic N terminus amino acid sequence of receptor protein and receptor peptide from Dr. Patrick Roche, who is now at Ventana Medical Systems Inc., Tucson, AZ; and bacteria-derived purified recombinant human TNF from Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA. The following items were purchased from indicated commercial sources: MCF-7 cells from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA); Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mixture F-12 Ham (DMEM/F-12) and antibiotics from Invitrogen; leupeptin, aprotinin, and dibutyryl cAMP from Sigma; enzyme immunoassay kits for cAMP measurements from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI); Pre-Tag nonradioactive protein kinase (PKA) activity measurement kits and CellTitre 96® Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay kits from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI); avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase kits from Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, CA); antibodies against IκBα and double-stranded oligonucleotide containing AP-1 consensus sequence from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); phospho-IkBα (Ser-32) antibody from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA); double-stranded oligonucleotide containing NF-κB consensus sequence from Invitrogen; Biocoat Matrigel invasion chambers from BD Biosciences. Twenty-one mer phosphorothioate antisense (5′-GCC GAG AAC CGC TGC TTC ATG-3′) and sense (5′-CAT GAA GCA GCG GTT CTC GGC-3′) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), designed from human hCG/LH receptor cDNA sequence covering ATG translation initiation codon, were synthesized in our laboratory. Cell Culture—MCF-7 cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. When cells reached ∼80% confluence, they were then washed twice and cultured in phenol red-free medium and used in various experiments. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates (5 × 103 cells/well) and cultured for 5 days in DMEM/F-12 containing various hormones. The culture medium was replaced every other day with medium of the same composition. At the end of culture, the cell proliferation was measured using CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay kits. Cell Invasion Assay—The cells (5 × 103) were incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of hCG. Then they were added to cell culture inserts mounted with Cyclopore 8.0-μm polyester membranes and coated with and without (control membranes) Matrigel. The cell inserts were then transferred to a 24-well cell culture cluster in which 1.25 ml of DMEM containing 2.5% NCS was pre-added to each well, and the plates were incubated for either 24 or 48 h at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells and Matrigel were removed by scrubbing the top surface of each insert with a cotton swab. Membranes were washed twice with DMEM/F-12 and then stained with Diffquick solution (Baxter, Chicago, IL). The membrane from each insert was cut, placed on a slide with the bottom side up, and examined under a light microscope. The pictures were taken from representative fields of each membrane, and the cell number was counted in a 49-cm2 area of the photographs. The percentage of invasion was calculated by a mean number of cells invading through the Matrigel insert membranes, divided by the mean number of cells migrating through the control insert membranes, multiplied by 100. Cell Culture with Phosphorothioate Antisense and Sense Human hCG/LH Receptor ODNs—MCF-7 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well and cultured for 24 h in 6-well plates in serum and phenol red-free medium containing 6 μm antisense or sense ODNs. Then immunostaining for hCG/LH receptors was performed on some cells, whereas others were used in different experiments. Immunocytochemistry—The cell pellets were fixed in Bouin's solution and immunostained by an avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method using a 1:500 dilution of hCG/LH receptor antibody (7Lojun S. Bao S. Lei Z.M. Rao Ch.V. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the procedural controls, the receptor antibody, preabsorbed with excess receptor peptide, was used. NF-κB Activation Assay—Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays were carried out as described previously (36Chaturvedi M.M. LaPushin R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14575-14583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts prepared from MCF-7 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated with 32P-end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide (6 μg of protein with 16 fmol of DNA) from the human immunodeficiency virus-long terminal repeat, 5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′ (bold indicates NF-κB binding sites) for 15 min at 37 °C, and then the DNA-protein complexes formed were resolved from free oligonucleotide on 6.6% native polyacrylamide gels. A double-stranded mutated oligonucleotide, 5′-TTGTTACAACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTTTCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′, was used to examine the specificity of NF-κB binding to DNA. The specificity of binding was also examined by competition assay with the unlabeled oligonucleotide. The gels were dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) using ImageQuaNT software. AP-1 Activation Assay—To assay AP-1 activation by electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay (36Chaturvedi M.M. LaPushin R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14575-14583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 6 μg of nuclear extract protein was incubated with 16 fmol of the 32P-end-labeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′ (bold indicates the AP-1 binding site) for 15 min at 37 °C, and then the DNA-protein complexes formed were resolved from free oligonucleotide on 6% native polyacrylamide gels. The specificity of binding was examined by competition assay with unlabeled oligonucleotide. The radioactive bands were visualized and quantified as indicated above. Western Blot for IκBα—Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from MCF-7 cells, and proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (37Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 38Chaturvedi M.M. Kumar A. Darnay B.G. Chainy G.B.N. Agarwal S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30129-30134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The proteins were then electroblotted to nitrocellulose filters, probed with 1:300 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against nonphosphorylated or phosphorylated IκBα, and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of cAMP Levels—The cAMP levels in 50-μl medium aliquots were quantified following the instructions provided in the enzyme immunoassay kit. The specificity of cAMP antibody was 100% for acetylated cAMP, 0.3% for cAMP, 0.05% for acetylated cGMP, and 0.01% or less for cGMP, acetylated adenosine, cytidine, guanosine, and uridine. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were less than 10%. The detection limit of the assay was 1.1 pmol/ml. Measurement of PKA Activity—Cells were lysed by sonication at 4 °C in 200 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotinin, and 50 μm leupeptin. PKA activity was determined by incubating 5–7 μg of lysate protein for 30 min at 30 °C with fluorescent-labeled A1 peptide. Nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated fluorescent peptides were separated on 0.8% agarose gels. Phosphorylated fluorescent peptide bands were excised and eluted, and the optical density at 570 nm was measured using a 96-well plate reader. PKA activity was calculated from the densitometric values using instructions provided by the kit manufacturer. Positive and negative controls supplied in the kits were assayed at the same time as MCF-7 cell samples. Replication of Experiments and Statistical Analysis—All the experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times on different occasions. All the data points were pooled for the calculation of means and their standard errors and for one-way analysis of variance and Duncan's multiple comparison test (39Steel R.G.D. Torrie J.H. Principles and Procedures of Statistics, with Special Reference to the Biological Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1960Google Scholar). The Effect of hCG on Cell Proliferation—Culturing MCF-7 cells with highly purified hCG resulted in a modest dose-dependent significant decrease in cell proliferation (Fig. 1A). This effect was mimicked by LH but not by others such as follicle-stimulating hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone in the same glycoprotein hormone family (Fig. 1B). Isolated subunits of hCG also had no effect. The Effect of hCG on Cell Invasion—Treatment of MCF-7 cells with hCG resulted in a dose-dependent significant decrease in invasion across Matrigel membranes at 24 or 48 h. (Fig. 2). This decrease was more dramatic than the decrease in cell proliferation. Receptor Requirement for the hCG Effects in MCF-7 Cells— The MCF-7 cells contain higher hCG/LH receptor levels than MDA-MB 231 and normal human breast epithelial HMEC cells (7Lojun S. Bao S. Lei Z.M. Rao Ch.V. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Hu Y.L. Lei Z.M. Rao Ch.V. Breast J. 1999; 5: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These higher levels were due to increased gene transcription as a result of increased levels of Ap2 and Egr transcription factors (9Hu Y.L. Lei Z.M. Rao Ch.V. Breast J. 1999; 5: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As MCF-7 cells are nontraditional targets of hCG/LH action, we felt some verification of receptor requirement in gonadotropins action was needed. This verification was obtained by inhibiting hCG/LH receptor synthesis in MCF-7 cells by treating them with phosphorothioate ODNs synthesized from human receptor sequence before treating them with hCG. As expected, MCF-7 cells were immunostained for hCG/LH receptor protein (Fig. 3A). This staining was absent when the receptor antibody was preabsorbed with excess receptor peptide (Fig. 3D). Treatment of MCF-7 cells with antisense (Fig. 3B) but not sense (Fig. 3C) hCG/LH receptor ODN resulted in a decreased receptor immunostaining to the procedural control level (Fig. 3D). hCG was ineffective in decreasing cell proliferation (Fig. 4A) and invasion (Fig. 4B) in antisense ODN-treated MCF-7 cells. In sense ODN-treated cells, which had similar receptor levels as non-ODN-treated cells, hCG was quite effective in decreasing both cell proliferation and invasion. Effect of hCG on NF-κB Activation—NF-κB is one of the transcription factors that inhibits cell proliferation and invasion by regulating the gene expression (40Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 41Biswas D.K. Dai S.C. Cruz A. Weiser B. Graner E. Pardee A.B. Med. Sci. 2001; 98: 10386-10391Google Scholar). Cytokines such as TNF mediate its effects by activating NF-κB (40Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 41Biswas D.K. Dai S.C. Cruz A. Weiser B. Graner E. Pardee A.B. Med. Sci. 2001; 98: 10386-10391Google Scholar, 42Manna S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 13307-13314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This led us to investigate the ability of hCG to prevent NF-κB activation induced by TNF. Fig. 5A shows that treatment of MCF-7 cells with TNF alone resulted in a time-dependent 8-fold activation of NF-κB. This activation was prevented by pretreatment with hCG. Effect of hCG on Phosphorylation and Degradation of IκBα— Inactive NF-κB is bound to inhibitor protein IκBα in cytoplasm (40Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 41Biswas D.K. Dai S.C. Cruz A. Weiser B. Graner E. Pardee A.B. Med. Sci. 2001; 98: 10386-10391Google Scholar). This binding masks the nuclear localization signal sequence in NF-κB. The phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα by the ubiquitin pathway are necessary for the release of NF-κB and expose its nuclear localization signal sequence, which allows it to move into the nucleus to bind to its target sequences in the promoter region of responsive genes (40Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 41Biswas D.K. Dai S.C. Cruz A. Weiser B. Graner E. Pardee A.B. Med. Sci. 2001; 98: 10386-10391Google Scholar). The ability of hCG to inhibit TNF-dependent NF-κB activation suggests that hCG might inhibit TNF-dependent IκB phosphorylation and degradation. The studies to investigate this possibility revealed that TNF treatment increased IκB phosphorylation between 5 and 15 min of incubation followed by return to basal levels, and hCG treatment inhibited the increase (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5C shows that TNF treatment also decreased IκBα levels at 10–15 min as a result of its degradation. This decrease was also prevented by hCG pretreatment. Effect of hCG on AP-1 Activation—AP-1 is another transcription factor that inhibits cell proliferation and invasion by regulating the gene expression (42Manna S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 13307-13314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 43Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). Various agents, such as TNF, that activate NF-κB can also activate AP-1 (42Manna S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 13307-13314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 43Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). This led us to test whether hCG could block AP-1 activation induced by TNF. Fig. 6 shows that treatment with TNF alone resulted in a time-dependent 4.8-fold activation of AP-1, and hCG treatment prevented this activation. Signaling in the hCG Actions in MCF-7 Cells—Although hCG is known to use more than one second messenger system, cAMP/PKA is the most common among them. Consistent with the possibility that hCG uses cAMP as a second messenger, hCG treatment of MCF-7 cells resulted in an increase in cAMP secretion (Fig. 7A). This response was abolished by pretreatment of cells with antisense hCG/LH receptor ODN, which decreased receptor protein levels. The treatment with sense ODN, which had no effect on the receptor protein, did not influence the ability of hCG to increase cAMP secretion. Since the cAMP increase results in PKA activation, the hCG effect on PKA activity was next investigated. As shown in Fig. 7B, treatment of MCF-7 cells with hCG resulted in a significant increase in PKA activity. This increase was not seen in antisense hCG/LH receptor ODN-treated cells. Sense ODN-treated cells, on the other hand, responded just as the hCG-treated cells, as compared with control cells. Further efforts to determine the cAMP involvement in the hCG action revealed that dibutyryl cAMP, a stable cAMP analog, mimicked hCG in blocking TNF-dependent NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8A). In addition, although dideoxyadenosine, an adenylate cyclase inhibitor, had no effect on its own nor could it affect the TNF-dependent activation of NF-κB, it was able to block the ability of hCG to prevent NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8B). Breast tissue and cells from a number of species contain hCG/LH receptors (6Tao Y-X. Lei Z.M. Rao Ch.V. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 1297-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 7Lojun S. Bao S.

Li, and C. V. Rao, submitted for publication. The physiological significance of breast receptors is largely unknown. It is possible, however, that breast LH/hCG receptors may play a role in the growth and differentiation in concert with ovarian steroid hormones. Consistent with this possibility, knockout of LH receptors resulted in a gross underdevelopment of mammary glands (44Russo I.H. Lei Z.M. Russo J. Beijia M. Rao Ch.V. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 2002; 9 (suppl.) (Abstr. 554): 245AGoogle Scholar). The development of glands in knockout animals can be stimulated by estradiol and progesterone replacement therapy; however, the branching pattern was not restored (44Russo I.H. Lei Z.M. Russo J. Beijia M. Rao Ch.V. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 2002; 9 (suppl.) (Abstr. 554): 245AGoogle Scholar). This finding suggests that LH and hCG might possibly control branching morphogenesis in mammary glands. Epidemiological studies demonstrated a decrease in breast cancer risk in women who complete full-term pregnancy at a young age (30MacMahon B. Cole P. Liu M. Lowe C.R. Mirra A.P. Ravinhar B.

Cancer Causes Control. 1996; 7: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since pregnancy is associated with the changes in numerous hormones, it was not clear which hormone(s) could be responsible for this protection. The studies on the rodent model of carcinogen-induced mammary tumor formation revealed that it could be hCG because its administration before, during, or after carcinogen treatment prevented or moderated mammary tumor formation (34Russo I.H. Russo J. Teicher B.A. Drug Resistance in Oncology. Marcel Dekker, New York1993: 537-560Google Scholar). Until mammary glands were shown to contain hCG/LH receptors, the beneficial effects of hCG in rodent mammary tumor model were thought to be due to stimulation of ovaries to secrete higher levels of estradiol, progesterone, and inhibin (15Alvarado M.V.

https://openalex.org/W1968013150,"Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is a tetramer composed of either intact (Trp(1)-Ala(222)) or proteolytically cleaved (Trp(1)-Glu(209)) subunits. The latter form is processed intracellularly before secretion and lacks the C-terminal extracellular matrix (ECM)-binding region ((210)RKKRRRESECKAA(222)-COOH). We have previously suggested that the C-terminal processing of EC-SOD is either a one-step mechanism accomplished by a single intracellular endoproteolytic event cleaving the Glu(209)-Arg(210) peptide bond or a two-step mechanism involving two proteinases (Enghild, J. J., Thogersen, I. B., Oury, T. D., Valnickova, Z., Hojrup, P., and Crapo, J. D. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 14818-14822). In the latter case, an initial endoproteinase cleavage occurs somewhere in the region between Glu(209) and Glu(216). A carboxypeptidase specific for basic amino acid residues subsequently trims the remaining basic amino acid residues to Glu(209). A naturally occurring mutation of EC-SOD substituting Arg(213) for Gly enabled us to test these hypotheses. The mutation does not prevent proteolysis of the ECM-binding region but prevents a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme from trimming residues beyond Gly(213). The R213G mutation is located in the ECM-binding region, and individuals carrying this mutation have an increased concentration of EC-SOD in the circulatory system. In this study, we purified the R213G EC-SOD variant from heterozygous or homozygous individuals and determined the C-terminal residue of the processed subunit to be Gly(213). This finding supports the two-step processing mechanism and indicates that the R213G mutation does not disturb the initial endoproteinase cleavage event but perturbs the subsequent trimming of the C terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2079022256,"Arterial wall sphingomyelinase (SMase) has been proposed to be involved in atherogenesis. SMase modification of lipoproteins has been shown to occur in atherosclerotic lesions and to facilitate their uptake by macrophages and foam cell formation. To investigate the mechanism of macrophage uptake enhanced by SMase, we prepared lipid emulsions containing sphingomyelin (SM) or ceramide (CER) as model particles of lipoproteins. SMase remarkably increased the uptake of SM-containing emulsions by J774 macrophages without apolipoproteins. The emulsion uptake was negatively correlated with the degree of particle aggregation by pretreatment with SMase, whereas the uptake of CER-containing emulsions was significantly larger than SM-containing emulsions, indicating that enhancement of uptake is due to the generation of CER molecules in particles but not to the aggregation by SMase. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) were crucial for CER-enhanced emulsion uptake, because heparin or lactoferrin inhibited the emulsion uptake. Confocal microscopy also showed that SMase promoted both binding and internalization of emulsions by J774 macrophages, which were almost abolished by lactoferrin. Apolipoprotein E further increased the uptake of CER-containing emulsions compared with SM-containing emulsions. These findings suggest the generation of CER in lipoproteins by SMase facilitates the macrophage uptake via HSPG and LRP pathways and plays a crucial role in foam cell formation.

The lipoprotein surface is mainly formed by phosphatidylcholine (PC) and SM together with cholesterol and apolipoproteins. The liver synthesizes sphingolipids de novo and incorporates the newly synthesized sphingolipids into very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (2Merrill Jr., A.H. Lingrell S. Wang E. Nikolana-Karakashian M. Valen T.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13834-13841Google Scholar). The SM/PC ratio in VLDL is 0.25 (3Barenholtz Y. Gatt S. Hauthorne J.N. Ansell G.B. Phospholipids. Elsevier Biomedical Press, NY1982: 129-177Google Scholar). Unlike PC, SM is not degraded by lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase, or lecithin/cholesterol acyltransferase (4Subbaiah P.V. Liu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20156-20163Google Scholar, 5Laboda H.M. Glick J.M. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 876: 233-242Google Scholar), and the transfer of SM among lipoproteins as well as between lipoproteins and cell membranes is slower than that of other phospholipids (6Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Pind S. Lipids. 1989; 24: 408-418Google Scholar). Thus, SM becomes enriched in VLDL remnants, and the SM/PC ratio in low density lipoproteins (LDL) is quite high (0.5) (7Schissel S.L. Jiang X.

Jiang X. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 905-912Google Scholar). The subendothelial retention of atherogenic lipoproteins, LDL, and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is a key event in the initiation of atherosclerosis. LDL extracted from human atherosclerotic lesions is highly enriched in SM compared with plasma LDL (7Schissel S.L. Jiang X. Tweedie-Hardman J. Jeong T. Camejo E.H. Najib J. Rapp J.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2738-2746Google Scholar). Sphingomyelinase (SMase) hydrolyzes SM to phosphorylcholine and ceramide (CER), a lipid second messenger in apoptosis, cell differentiation, and cell proliferation (13Kolesnick R.N. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 285-300Google Scholar). At least seven different SMases have been identified (14Kraemer F.B. Suzuki J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2509-2510Google Scholar). Acid lysosomal SMase is found ubiquitously in tissues and defective in types A and B Niemann-Pick disease (15Levade T. Salvayre R. Blazy-Douste L. J. Clin. Chem. Biochem. 1986; 24: 205-220Google Scholar). A variety of cell types present in atherosclerotic lesions secrete SMase (16Marathe S. Schissel S.L. Yellin M.J. Beatini N. Mintzer R. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4081-4088Google Scholar). Secretory SMase arises from the acid SMase gene via differential protein trafficking of a common protein precursor (17Schissel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Google Scholar). SMase secretion by endothelial cells is stimulated by inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β and interferon-γ (16Marathe S. Schissel S.L. Yellin M.J. Beatini N. Mintzer R. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4081-4088Google Scholar). The CER content of aggregated LDL in atherosclerotic lesions is 10- to 50-fold higher than that of plasma LDL (18Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Google Scholar). Treatment of LDL particles with SMase from Bacillus cereus has been shown to induce both aggregation and fusion of the particles, which depend on the accumulation of CER within the particles (18Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Google Scholar, 19Xu X.-X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24849-24858Google Scholar, 20Öörni K. Hakala J.K. Annila A. Ala-Korpela M. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29127-29134Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of LDL by SMase facilitated their uptake by macrophages and induced cholesteryl ester accumulation (foam cell formation) (19Xu X.-X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24849-24858Google Scholar, 21Marathe S. Choi Y. Leventhal A.R. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2607-2613Google Scholar). The formation of ceramide from SM could thus represent a critical step in atherosclerosis. However, no studies have addressed the effect of the SMase-induced lipid composition change on interactions between lipoproteins and cell surface receptors. Emulsion particles have been used as protein-free models for plasma lipoproteins. We previously demonstrated that incorporation of SM into emulsion surface reduced the apolipoprotein E (apoE)- or lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-mediated emulsion uptake by HepG2 cells (22Morita S. Okuhira K. Tsuchimoto N. Vertut-Doï A. Saito H. Nakano M. Handa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1631: 169-176Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the effect of SM hydrolysis with SMase on the aggregation of emulsion particles and the uptake by J774 macrophages. Our results show that the increase in SM-containing emulsion uptake by SMase is dependent on the formation of CER but not on the particle aggregation and that the CER-enhanced emulsion uptake involves the interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and LDL receptor-related protein (LRP). Materials—Egg yolk PC was generously provided by Asahi Kasei Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Triolein (TO), egg yolk SM, SMase (from B. cereus), heparin, bovine milk LPL, choline oxidase, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). 1-Pyrenemethyl 3β-(cis-9-octadecenoyloxy)-22,23-bisnor-5-cholenate (PMC oleate) and cholesteryl-4,4-difluoro-5-(2-pyrrolyl)-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indecene-3-dodecanoate (cholesteryl-BODIPY) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).

All other chemicals used were of highest reagent grade. Preparation of Emulsions—The lipid emulsions were prepared by the method described previously using a high pressure emulsifier (Nanomizer System YSNM-2000AR; Yoshida Kikai Co., Nagoya, Japan) (23Saito H. Minamida T. Arimoto I. Handa T. Miyajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15515-15520Google Scholar). Briefly, mixtures of TO, PC, SM, and CER were suspended in Hepes buffer (137 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 6.1 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm Hepes; pH 7.4) and successively emulsified under 100 MPa of pressure at 40–60 °C. Depending on the purpose of the experiment, PMC oleate or cholesteryl-BODIPY, which has been used as a tracer of lipoprotein endocytosis (24Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 932-936Google Scholar, 27Bisgaier C.L. Minton L.L. Essenburg A.D. White A. Homan R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1625-1634Google Scholar), was added into the lipid mixtures at a ratio of 1 or 0.1 mol% of TO, respectively. After removing contaminating vesicles by ultracentrifugation, homogenous emulsion particles were obtained. The mean particle diameter of each emulsions was about 120 nm, except for large TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsions (about 230 nm), determined from dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements using Photal LPA-3000/3100 (Otsuka Electronic Co., Osaka, Japan) equipped with a helium-neon laser at a wavelength of 632.8 nm. The concentrations of phospholipid (PL) and TO were determined using enzymatic assay kits purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals. SM and CER concentrations were determined by a thin layer chromatography-hydrogen flame ionization detector (Iatroscan MK-5; Iatron Laboratories Inc., Tokyo, Japan). As a result, we confirmed that the surface PC, SM, and ceramide composition of isolated emulsions was the same as that of the starting lipid mixtures, and isolated emulsions contained the expected amount of SM and ceramide. The molar ratios of core TO to total surface PL for isolated TO-PC, TO-PC/SM (4/1), TO-PC/SM (2/1), TO-PC/CER (2/1), and large TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsions were 4.75 ± 0.23 (n = 3), 4.68 ± 0.16 (n = 3), 5.08 ± 0.17 (n = 8), 5.18 ± 0.16 (n = 3), and 8.48 (n = 1), respectively. Assay for SM Hydrolysis—Lipid emulsions (250 μm TO) were incubated with 10 milliunits/ml SMase at 37 °C in Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.6 mm MgCl2 and 1.1 mm CaCl2. At the indicated time points, hydrolysis was stopped by delipidation with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), and the degree of SM hydrolysis was determined as the amount of released phosphorylcholine. Enzymatic measurement of phosphorylcholine concentrations was carried out by using a three-step procedure. The addition of alkaline phosphatase generated choline from phosphorylcholine. The newly formed choline was used to generate hydrogen peroxide in a reaction catalyzed by choline oxidase. Finally, with peroxidase as a catalyst, hydrogen peroxide was used together with phenol and 4-aminoantipyrine to generate a red quinone pigment, with an optimal absorption at 505 nm. The SMase preparation did not contain either phospholipase A1 or A2 activity against PC or lipase activity against TO, because fatty acid was not detected after the incubation of TO-PC emulsions with 10 milliunits/ml SMase for 2 h at 37 °C, which was tested by the enzymatic assay kit purchased from Wako. Size Estimation of the Emulsion Particles Aggregated by SMase— Lipid emulsions (250 μm TO) were incubated with 10 milliunits/ml SMase at 37 °C in Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.6 mm MgCl2 and 1.1 mm CaCl2 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1% BSA. After incubation for the indicated times, hydrolysis was stopped by the addition of EDTA to give a final concentration of 10 mm. The degree of the aggregation was determined as the mean diameter of emulsion particles measured by DLS. The emulsions were diluted by Hepes buffer and put into a quartz cell. The mean hydrodynamic diameter was evaluated by the cumulant method. Cell Cultures—J774 macrophages and HepG2 cells were grown in a humidified incubator (5% CO2) at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. The FBS was changed to 1% BSA 15 min before each experiment. Experiments were performed in DMEM containing 1% BSA. Cell Uptake Assays—The cells were incubated with PMC oleate-labeled emulsions (250 μm TO) at 37 °C for 2 h in the absence or presence of 10 milliunits/ml SMase. For experiments with apoE, PMC oleate-labeled emulsions were preincubated with apoE at 37 °C for 30 min, allowing sufficient time for equilibrium binding (28Yokoyama S. Kawai Y. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16375-16382Google Scholar). After incubation, the cells were chilled on ice and washed twice with cold Hepes buffer containing 0.2% BSA and then washed twice with cold Hepes buffer alone. Cells were then dissolved in 0.2% Triton X-100. Fluorescence intensity of PMC oleate (excitation 342 nm, emission 377 nm) measured with a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer and protein concentration determined by the method of Lowry (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) were determined to calculate particle uptake. By this method, uptake means binding and internalization by the cells. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Cholesteryl-BODIPY-labeled TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsions (250 μm TO) were added to J774 macrophages grown on coverglasses, and incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence or absence of 10 milliunits/ml SMase and 5 mg/ml lactoferrin. After incubation, the cells were washed twice with cold Hepes buffer containing 0.2% BSA and with cold Hepes buffer. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min on ice and washed three times with Hepes buffer. The plasma membrane glycoproteins were labeled by incubation with 20 μg/ml rhodamine-concanavalin A (ConA) at room temperature for 5 min. The labeled cells were washed three times with Hepes buffer to remove excess reagent. The cells were mounted in 2.5% triethylenediamine and 50% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline. Confocal fluorescence images were taken with a confocal microscope (MRC-1024; Bio-Rad) at 488 and 568 nm excitation with emission filters of 522DF35 for cholesteryl-BODIPY and HQ598DF40 for rhodamine-ConA. The objective specifications were 40× oil immersion and numerical aperture 1.0. Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of differences between mean values was analyzed using the non-paired t test. Multiple comparisons were performed using the Sheffé test following analysis of variance. Differences and correlation were considered significant at p < 0.05. Unless indicated otherwise, results are given as mean ± S.E. (n = 3). SM Hydrolysis and Aggregation of Emulsion Particles by SMase—To study the effect of SM hydrolysis on the aggregation of emulsion particles, TO-PC, TO-PC/SM (4/1), and TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsions (250 μm TO) were treated with 10 milliunits/ml B. cereus SMase at 37 °C. Bacterial SMases are a reasonable model for mammalian SMases in terms of enzymatic activity but not necessarily in terms of their structure. The degrees of hydrolysis by SMase were determined from the amounts of released phosphorylcholine. Under the above conditions, almost all of the SM molecules on TO-PC/SM (4/1) and TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsions were hydrolyzed by SMase after incubation for 30 min, whereas TO-PC emulsions were not hydrolyzed (Fig. 1A). The aggregation of the emulsion particles was determined from the mean diameter of emulsion particles measured by DLS. As shown in Fig. 1B, SMase induced aggregation of TO-PC/SM (4/1) and TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsions following a rapid enzymatic action. After 120-min incubation with SMase, the mean diameters of TO-PC/SM (4/1) and TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsions increased 1.6- and 2.1-fold, respectively, but TO-PC emulsions were not aggregated. The degree of aggregation was consistent with the degree of SM hydrolysis in each type of emulsions. When EDTA was added at the beginning of the reaction to inhibit the enzymatic activity of B. cereus SMase, an Mg2+-dependent enzyme (30Ikezawa H. Matsushita M. Tomita M. Taguchi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 588-595Google Scholar), the mean diameters of three types of emulsions did not change (data not shown). These results suggest the aggregation of SM-containing emulsions is due to the enzymatic activity but not the structural action of B. cereus SMase. Effects of SMase on Emulsion Uptake by J774 Macrophages—We examined the uptake of TO-PC, TO-PC/SM (4/1), and TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsions by J774 macrophages in the presence of 10 milliunits/ml SMase without apolipoproteins (Fig. 2). In the absence of SMase, the uptake of TO-PC/SM (4/1) and TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsions was slightly higher than TO-PC emulsions. SMase led to 2.3- and 3.0-fold enhancements of TO-PC/SM (4/1) and TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsion uptake, respectively. In contrast, SMase increased the uptake of TO-PC emulsions only 1.3-fold, suggesting the enhanced uptake of SM-containing emulsions was caused primarily by the action of SMase on the emulsion particles rather than on the cell surface. To determine which of the two consequences of SMase activity, generation of ceramide or particle aggregation, is responsible for the enhancement of the emulsion uptake, we next studied the relationship between cellular uptake and particle aggregation induced by the preincubation of TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsions with SMase. As depicted in Fig. 3A, prolongation of the preincubation time led to enhanced degree of emulsion aggregation, characterized by increased mean diameter, as well as to decreased uptake into J774 macrophages. The fall in the emulsion uptake was significantly correlated with the increase in the mean particle diameter (r = 0.983, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3B). To examine the involvement of CER molecules in the emulsion uptake by J774 macrophages, we conducted cellular uptake studies using CER-containing emulsions with similar size to SM-containing emulsions. Fig. 4 shows that the uptake of TO-PC/CER (2/1) emulsions was 2.1-fold larger than that of TO-PC/SM (2/1). Although TO-PC/CER (2/1) emulsions were neither hydrolyzed nor aggregated in the presence of 10 milliunits/ml SMase for 2 h at 37 °C (data not shown), this emulsion uptake was increased 1.3-fold by SMase. Large TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsion (about 230 nm) uptake was only 12% of TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsion (about 120 nm) uptake, indicating the uptake of the emulsions is largely dependent on their size. We conclude that CER formed in particles by SMase enhances their uptake into J774 macrophages, whereas the increase in size or particle aggregation decreases uptake. Involvement of HSPGs and LRP in Emulsion Uptake—To assess if known lipoprotein receptors on J774 macrophages play roles in the interaction with emulsion particles, we conducted a series of experiments using inhibitors of lipoprotein receptors. Lipoproteins bind to cell surfaces through interactions with HSPGs. LRP has multiple ligands and mediates remnant lipoprotein uptake. HSPGs participate in the uptake, either associating with LRP or acting alone as a receptor (31Mahley R.W. Ji Z.-S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Google Scholar). LRP has been reported to mediate the uptake of SMase-aggregated LDL by macrophages (32Sakr S.W. Eddy R.J. Barth H. Wang F. Greenberg S. Maxfield F.R. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37649-37658Google Scholar). We tested if cell surface HSPGs and LRP are responsible for the observed effect of SMase or CER on the emulsion uptake by incubating J774 macrophages with emulsions in the presence of heparin or lactoferrin (Fig. 5). At the current concentration (100 μg/ml), heparin selectively blocks ligand binding to heparan sulfate side chains of HSPGs but not lipoprotein binding to the members of the LDL receptor family or other lipoprotein receptors (33Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brunschede G.Y. Brown M.S. Cell. 1976; 7: 85-95Google Scholar, 34Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin.

Heparin significantly inhibited the uptake of TO-PC/SM emulsions in the presence and absence of SMase and that of TO-PC/CER emulsions. Lactoferrin interacts with HSPGs and LRP and has been suggested to inhibit remnant uptake by preventing their binding to HSPGs and subsequent transfer to LRP (37Ji Z.-S. Mahley R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 2025-2032Google Scholar, 38Ziere G.J. Krujit J.K. Bijsterbosch M.K. van Berkel T.J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 289-295Google Scholar). Lactoferrin also markedly reduced the uptake of TO-PC/SM emulsions in the presence and absence of SMase and that of TO-PC/CER emulsions. RAP is a potent inhibitor of all known ligand interactions of LRP (39Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Nerbonne J.M. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18521-18528Google Scholar). Inclusion of 40 μg/ml RAP in incubation with J774 macrophages resulted in significantly decreased uptake of TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsions in the presence of SMase (17.2 ± 4.2% inhibition). However, the antibody (20 μg/ml) against either CD36 or class A scavenger receptor on J774 macrophages, known to block oxidized LDL or acetyl LDL uptake, respectively, had no effect on TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsion uptake in the presence of SMase (data not shown). We next explored the cell specificity of the enhancement of the emulsion uptake by SMase. As shown in Fig. 6, larger enhancement of SM containing emulsion uptake by SMase was observed in HepG2 cells, expressing HSPGs and LRP, as well as in J774 macrophages. Thus, the enhancement of emulsion uptake by ceramide appears to occur largely through HSPGs and LRP, non-phagocytic means.Fig. 6Effect of SMase on the uptake of emulsion particles by HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with TO-PC (open bars), TO-PC/SM (4/1) (cross-hatched bars), and TO-PC/SM (2/1) (filled bars) emulsions (250 μm TO) in the absence or presence of 10 milliunits/ml SMase. The mean particle diameter of emulsions was about 120 nm. Each bar represents the mean ± S.E. of three measurements. *, p < 0.05, significant difference between TO-PC and TO-PC/SM (4:1) emulsions. §, p < 0.05, significant difference between TO-PC and TO-PC/SM (2:1) emulsions. #, p < 0.05, significant difference between TO-PC/SM (4:1) and TO-PC/SM (2:1) emulsions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Confocal Microscopic Images of Emulsion Uptake by J774 Macrophages—To investigate the distribution of emulsions in J774 macrophages, we observed the cells after incubation with TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsions in the presence or absence of SMase, using confocal fluorescence microscopy. The emulsions were labeled by cholesteryl-BODIPY (green). Plasma membrane glycoproteins were stained by rhodamine-ConA (red), which selectively binds to α-d-mannosyl and α-d-glucosyl residues (40Gunther G.R. Wang J.L. Yahara I. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1012-1026Google Scholar). When impermeable cells are incubated with rhodamine-ConA, fluorescence is visible around the cells but not within because the lectin binds only to plasma membrane glycoproteins (41Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G. Rosen A.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1317-1330Google Scholar). After an incubation time of 2 h with TO-PC/SM (2/1) emulsions, emulsion fluorescence (green) was detected not only on the cell surface but also inside the cells (Fig. 7A). As one can see, SMase enhanced both binding and internalization of the emulsions (Fig. 7B). Lactoferrin completely inhibited internalization of the emulsions in the presence of SMase, and only a slight amount of emulsion binding to the cell surface was shown (Fig. 7C). These results are consistent with those in Figs. 2 and 6 and indicate that SMase stimulated both binding and internalization of SM-containing emulsions by the cells. Effects of ApoE and LPL on Emulsion Uptake by J774 Macrophages—ApoE is a ligand for LDL receptor, LRP and VLDL receptor, and binds to cell surface HSPGs (31Mahley R.W. Ji Z.-S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Google Scholar, 42Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Google Scholar). Within atherosclerotic lesions, lipoproteins have been found to contain apoE in addition to apoB-100 (43Ylä-Herttuala S. Jaakkola O. Ehnholm C. Tikkanen M.J. Solakivi T. Särkioja T. Nikkari T. J.

Yagyu H. Chen Z. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Yahagi N. Tamura Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Yamada N. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 154: 51-60Google Scholar). ApoE directly modifies macrophage-mediated immune responses that contribute to atherosclerosis (46Curtiss L.K. Boisvert W.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 243-251Google Scholar). Increased LPL activity in the arterial wall is correlated with increased areas of lipid deposition and increased atherosclerotic lesion formation (47Zilversmit D.B. Circulation. 1979; 60: 473-485Google Scholar). LPL activity in mouse macrophages is correlated with their propensity to develop atherosclerosis (48Renier G. Skamene E. DeSanctis J.B. Radzioch D. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 190-196Google Scholar). LPL contains binding sites for lipoproteins and for specific cell-surface receptors, including HSPGs and LRP (49Williams S.E. Inoue I. Tran H.

https://openalex.org/W2122661102,"The thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent bio-synthetic enzyme acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) catalyzes decarboxylation of pyruvate and specific condensation of the resulting ThDP-bound two-carbon intermediate, hydroxyethyl-ThDP anion/enamine (HEThDP-), with a second ketoacid, to form acetolactate or acetohydroxybutyrate. Whereas the mechanism of formation of HEThDP- from pyruvate is well understood, the role of the enzyme in control of the carboligation reaction of HEThDP- is not. Recent crystal structures of yeast AHAS from Duggleby's laboratory suggested that an arginine residue might interact with the second ketoacid substrate.

Bioeng. 84, 833-840) provides a new tool for studying the fate of HEThDP- in AHAS, since the formation of the new product has a very different dependence on active site modifications than does acetohydroxyacid acid formation. The effects of mutagenesis of four different residues in the site on the rates and specificities of the normal and unnatural reactions support a critical role for Arg276 in the stabilization of the transition states for ligation of the incoming second ketoacid with HEThDP- and/or for the breaking of the product-ThDP bond.

However, despite the similarity of AHASs to, for example, pyruvate decarboxylases and pyruvate oxidases (3Chang Y.-Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3937-3945Google Scholar, 4Muller Y.A.

Biol. 1996; 256: 590-600Google Scholar), AHASs carry out a specific carboligation reaction in which the decarboxylation of pyruvate is followed by the condensation of the bound hydroxyethyl-ThDP anion/enamine (HEThDP-) intermediate with a second aliphatic ketoacid to form an acetohydroxyacid (Fig. 1). Whereas the role of the enzyme in the first steps in AHAS catalysis (i.e. activation of ThDP (7Huebner G. Tittmann K. Killenberg-Jabs M. Schaeffner J. Spinka M. Neef H. Kern D. Kern G. Schneider G. Wikner C. Ghisla S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 221-228Google Scholar), decarboxylation of pyruvate, and formation of HEThDP- (step 1 in Fig. 1)) is comparable with the function of other members of its homologous family (8Bar-Ilan A. Balan V. Tittmann K. Golbik R. Vyazmensky M. Hubner G. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11946-11954Google Scholar), it has been difficult to suggest roles for specific protein residues in the final steps (2 and 3) of the reaction in which the product acetohydroxyacid is formed and released. One reason for this uncertainty has been the lack of clear direct information on the structure of the regions of the active site that might be involved in selective reaction of HEThDP- with a second ketoacid. Although we have proposed a homology model for AHAS isozyme II from Escherichia coli (9Ibdah M. Bar-Ilan A. Livnah O. Schloss J.V. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16282-16291Google Scholar), based on the crystal structure of pyruvate oxidase from Lactobacillus plantarum (LpPOX) (4Muller Y.A. Schumacher G. Rudolph R. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 315-335Google Scholar), these two proteins have very different sequences in the region that is likely to interact with the second substrate. In the first published crystal structure of an AHAS, that of the catalytic subunits of the yeast enzyme (10Pang S.S. Duggleby R.G. Guddat L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 249-262Google Scholar), this region was disordered. The recent publication of a new structure of the yeast enzyme with a tightly bound herbicide (11Pang S.S. Guddat L.W. Duggleby R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7639-7644Google Scholar) now provides a solid framework for consideration of the role of the protein in directing the fate of the HEThDP- intermediate. A second, equally serious obstacle to the understanding of the mechanism of AHAS has been a lack of experimental tools for studying the rates of individual steps in the reaction and, thus, the effects of modifications of the enzyme on these steps. Ciskanik and Schloss (12Ciskanik L.M. Schloss J.V. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3357Google Scholar) showed that HEThDP- does not accumulate significantly in the reaction of AHAS II, so that following the formation and disappearance of covalent intermediates in presteady state experiments would be difficult. We were able to use the competition between pyruvate and 2-ketobutyrate (13Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Gollop N. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3750-3756Google Scholar), the two physiological second substrates that can react with the intermediate on AHAS, to show that the formation of the common intermediate is rate-determining and that the step that determines which product will be formed probably comes after HEThDP- formation (14Gollop N. Damri B. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6310-6317Google Scholar). The competition between second substrates was also used to identify a tryptophan residue critical for the high preference of most AHASs for 2-ketobutyrate (9Ibdah M. Bar-Ilan A. Livnah O. Schloss J.V. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16282-16291Google Scholar). An interesting side reaction, leading to peracetate formation in AHAS II, showed that oxygen could compete with the natural substrates for the intermediate (15Tse J.M.T. Schloss J.V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10398-10403Google Scholar, 16Schloss J.V. Hixon M.S. Chu F. Chang S. Duggleby R.G. Bisswanger H. Schellenberger A. Biochemistry and Physiology of Thiamin Diphosphate Enzymes. A. u. C. Intemann, Wissenschaftlicher Verlag, Prien, Germany1996: 580-585Google Scholar), but this very slow reaction is not appropriate for study of the function of residues in the enzyme active site. Tittmann et al. (17Tittmann K. Golbik R. Uhlemann K. Khailova L. Schneider G. Patel M. Jordan F. Chipman D.M. Duggleby R.G. Hubner G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7885-7891Google Scholar) have recently developed a quenched proton magnetic resonance technique for determining the partition of ThDP among various covalent intermediates in an enzymic reaction. For AHAS II, Tittmann et al. (17Tittmann K. Golbik R. Uhlemann K. Khailova L. Schneider G. Patel M. Jordan F. Chipman D.M. Duggleby R.G. Hubner G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7885-7891Google Scholar) demonstrated that by far the slowest step is formation of the first covalent intermediate, lactyl-ThDP. We have recently found that AHASs can catalyze an alternative reaction, in which an aromatic aldehyde reacts with the intermediate HEThDP- to form an arylacetylcarbinol (Fig. 1) with very high enantiomeric specificity (18Engel S. Vyazmensky M. Geresh S. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 84: 833-840Google Scholar). The stereochemistry, kinetics, and specificity of the competition between pyruvate and benzaldehyde shed light on the location of the reacting substrates in the active site of AHAS and can be used to identify residues in the enzyme that interact with the alternative electrophilic reagents. In particular, this approach has allowed us to identify Arg276 as crucial to the specificity of the enzyme for condensation with a second ketoacid. Reagents—Hepes, sodium pyruvate, FAD, ThDP, dithiothreitol (DTT), ethyl 2-acetoxy-2-methyl acetoacetate, benzaldehyde, and Me2SO were obtained from Sigma. Racemic acetolactate was prepared by basic (KOH) hydrolysis of ethyl 2-acetoxy-2-methyl-acetoacetate as previously described (19Krampitz L.O. Arch. Biochem. 1948; 17: 81-85Google Scholar). The concentration of S-acetolactate after conversion was determined from the spectrophotometric assay of NADPH oxidation by ketolacid reductoisomerase (20Aulabaugh A. Schloss J.V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2824-2830Google Scholar), which is quite specific for the S configuration (21Crout D.H.G. McIntyre C.R. Alcock N.W. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1991; 2: 53-62Google Scholar). All other materials were of analytical grade. Construction of Plasmids pRSET-GM and pQEV-GM—XL-1-Blue MRF′ strain (Stratagene Europe) was used as the host strain in construction of wild-type and mutated plasmids. In the initial phase of our work, we used the plasmid pRSET-GM for expression of a hexahistidine-tagged AHAS II. This plasmid was obtained by inserting the BamHI-EcoRI fragment containing the ilvGM genes from pET-GM (a gift from R. G. Duggleby (22Hill C.M. Pang S.S. Duggleby R.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 891-898Google Scholar)) into plasmid pRSET A (Invitrogen). Most of the coding region was then replaced by inserting the NsiI-EcoRI fragment from pRGM (8Bar-Ilan A. Balan V. Tittmann K. Golbik R. Vyazmensky M. Hubner G. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11946-11954Google Scholar) to create pRSET-GM, which expresses a protein with a sequence identical to the original AHAS II enzyme of E. coli ilvG2096 fused at its N terminus to the pRSET hexahistidine leader. pRSET-GM was transformed into BL21(DE3) for expression. In later work, the identical protein was expressed from plasmid pQEV-GM, a derivative of expression plasmid pQE60 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for which E. coli XL-MRF serves as host, in a system that we found to be more stable and easier to work with. A unique NdeI site was constructed immediately downstream of the promoter of pQE60, and the original unique NdeI site (bp 1370 from ORI) was destroyed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to create plasmid pQE601. 2H. Shmueli, personal communication. Two separate fragments from pRSET-GM (the first a 975-bp NdeI-NdeI fragment that includes the polyhistidine region and 5′-end of ilvG and the second a 1039-bp NdeIHindIII fragment that includes the remainder of ilvGM) were then ligated into the NdeI-HindIII sites of the pQE601 polylinker. Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced in pQEV-GM at positions corresponding to residues Phe109 and Arg276 using the QuikChange™site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers used were designed to introduce an additional restriction site or destroy existing sites, as an aid in screening for clones with mutated plasmids. Mutations were introduced at residues Trp464 (9Ibdah M. Bar-Ilan A. Livnah O. Schloss J.V. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16282-16291Google Scholar) and Met250 using the PCR overlap extension method (23Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar). Fragments containing the mutation were excised from the original mutated plasmids and introduced by ligation into pQEV-GM. The complete coding region of each plasmid used for mutein expression was sequenced. Preparation of Enzymes—Bacterial growth and expression of cloned genes were carried out as described elsewhere (8Bar-Ilan A. Balan V. Tittmann K. Golbik R. Vyazmensky M. Hubner G. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11946-11954Google Scholar). Wild-type AHAS isozyme II from E. coli and all of the mutated variants (muteins) of AHAS II whose properties are described here were obtained as N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged proteins overexpressed in XL-1-Blue MRF′. Bacterial cells were disrupted by sonication in a buffer (buffer A) with 10 mm imidazole, 0.5 m KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 20 μm FAD. After 1 h of centrifugation at 27,000 × g, the supernatant was loaded on a 1 × 5.5-cm column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) previously washed with buffer A. The column was then washed with ∼50 ml of buffer A (until no more protein eluted), and the His′-GM protein eluted with a buffer identical to A except for the addition of 0.4 m imidazole. The fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm KPi, pH 7.6, containing 20 μm FAD and 1 mm DTT. The protein was concentrated for storage at -20 °C by dialysis against 50 mm KPi, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm DTT, 20 μm FAD, 10% polyethylene glycol 20000 (Merck Schuchart, Darmstadt) and 50% glycerol. Enzyme assays were carried out using the methods previously described (8Bar-Ilan A. Balan V. Tittmann K. Golbik R. Vyazmensky M. Hubner G. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11946-11954Google Scholar) in a 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ThDP, and 75 μm FAD, with 100 mm pyruvate as substrate, except where otherwise indicated. The ketoacid substrate competition experiments were carried out in the same buffer, by measuring acetohydroxybutyrate and acetolactate formation simultaneously in reaction mixtures containing 2-ketobutyrate and pyruvate (14Gollop N. Damri B. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6310-6317Google Scholar), and analyzed by fitting the data to appropriate equations using the nonlinear least squares program SigmaPlot 2000 (SPSS, Inc.). At a given constant pyruvate concentration, the total rate of acetohydroxyacid production by wild type and some mutants of AHAS II, V, is constant (9Ibdah M. Bar-Ilan A. Livnah O. Schloss J.V. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16282-16291Google Scholar, 14Gollop N. Damri B. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6310-6317Google Scholar), and the 2-ketobutyrate dependence of the individual rates (VAL and VAHB) can be fit simultaneously to Equations 1 and 2. VAL=V⋅[Pyr]/([Pyr]+R⋅[KB])(Eq. 1) VAHB=V⋅R⋅[KB]/([Pyr]+R⋅[KB])(Eq. 2) R is the characteristic 2-ketobutyrate specificity parameter for a given enzyme, defined by R = (VAHB/VAL)·([Pyr]/[KB]). For muteins where the total rate is not constant, Equations 3 and 4 hold as follows, VAL=Va⋅[Pyr]/([Pyr]+f⋅[KB])(Eq. 3) VAHB=Vb⋅f⋅[KB]/([Pyr]+f⋅[KB])(Eq. 4) where Va is the rate in the absence of 2-ketobutyrate, Vb is the rate of acetohydroxybutyrate formation at saturation with 2-ketobutyrate, and f is a characteristic parameter for the enzyme. If Equations 3 and 4 hold, then the characteristic specificity of the enzyme is given by R = f·Vb/Va. Reactions with benzaldehyde were carried out at 30 °C, in the presence of 0.1 m Hepes/KOH, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ThDP, 0.05 mm FAD, 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and varied amounts of pyruvate and benzaldehyde. The reaction mixture contained Me2SO to facilitate dissolution of benzaldehyde. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. Analyses—For HPLC analyses of phenyl acetyl carbinol (PAC) formation, the enzymatic reaction was terminated by heating at 100 °C for 2 min, and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. The HPLC separations were carried out as previously described on a C18-TSKgel ODS-80TM 5 μm column (250 × 4.6 mm) (TosoHaas) with 30% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid (v/v) as eluent (18Engel S. Vyazmensky M. Geresh S. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 84: 833-840Google Scholar). A creatine-naphthol colorimetric method was used for the simultaneous assay of acetolactate and PAC (18Engel S. Vyazmensky M. Geresh S. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 84: 833-840Google Scholar). In this method, the colored products derived from PAC and acetolactate have different absorbance spectra, allowing the calculation of the concentrations of both products from absorbance at two wavelengths with simultaneous equations (18Engel S. Vyazmensky M. Geresh S. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 84: 833-840Google Scholar). Absorbance was measured with a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. Circular dichroism was measured on a Jasco model J715 spectropolarimeter. We have found 3M. Vinogradov, A. Kaplun, M. Vyazmensky, R. Golbik, K. Uhlemann, L. Meshalkina, Z. Barak, G. Hübner, and D. M. Chipman, manuscript in preparation. that circular dichroism can be reliably used for following reactions of AHAS. At 310 nm, S-acetolactate has a molar ellipticity of +2460 degrees cm2 dmol-1, and R-PAC has a molar ellipticity of -2390 degrees cm2 dmol-1. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Kinetics of Synthesis of Phenyl Acetyl Carbinol—We have found that, in addition to catalyzing the physiological reactions leading to the formation of acetohydroxybutyrate and acetolactate (Fig. 1) (24Chipman D. Barak Z. Schloss J.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 401-419Google Scholar), AHAS II can catalyze the formation of R-phenyl acetyl carbinol (R-PAC) from pyruvate and benzaldehyde (18Engel S. Vyazmensky M. Geresh S. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 84: 833-840Google Scholar). AHAS II specifically forms R-PAC with an enantiomeric excess of >98% (18Engel S. Vyazmensky M. Geresh S. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 84: 833-840Google Scholar), whereas the acetohydroxyacid products formed by AHAS have the S absolute configuration (25Crout D.H.G. Lee E.R. Rathbone D.L. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1990; 1: 1367-1370Google Scholar). If one assumes that the carbonyl groups of the alternative second substrates all make similar contacts in the enzyme active site as they react with HEThDP-, then the aromatic ring of benzaldehyde and the carboxyl group of a ketoacid must occupy the same general region in the site. The hydrogen on the new chiral carbon of R-PAC would thus point in the same direction as the methyl (or ethyl) group of the acetohydroxyacid (Fig. 2). If this analysis is correct, then different residues in the enzyme active site must be involved in determining the preference for pyruvate, 2-ketobutyrate, or benzaldehyde as the second substrate. This prediction has been born out by a series of competition experiments with wild-type AHAS II and its variants. In experiments where the concentration of pyruvate is held constant and that of 2-ketobutyrate is raised, the initial rate of formation of acetolactate (VAL) is slowed, and that of acetohydroxybutyrate (VAHB) is increased (9Ibdah M. Bar-Ilan A. Livnah O. Schloss J.V. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16282-16291Google Scholar, 14Gollop N. Damri B. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6310-6317Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The total rate of acetohydroxyacid formation by wild-type AHAS II remains essentially constant, and the rates can be fit simultaneously to Equations 1 and 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). For this enzyme, R, the preference for reaction with ketobutyrate, is close to 60. Acetolactate formation is also inhibited in the presence of benzaldehyde, and the initial rate of synthesis of acetolactate decreases and the rate of R-PAC synthesis increases as the concentration of benzaldehyde is raised (Fig. 3B). Equations 5 and 6 describing the dependence of the rates of formation of acetolactate and PAC (VPAC) at a given pyruvate and varying benzaldehyde (BA) concentrations would be the equivalent of Equations 3 and 4. VAL=Va⋅[Pyr]/([Pyr]+f[BA])(Eq. 5) VPAC=Vc⋅f⋅[BA]/([Pyr]+f⋅[BA])(Eq. 6) In this case, however, the total rate of the two reactions decreases with increasing aldehyde, so that the overall influence of the benzaldehyde concentration on the rates of formation of acetolactate and PAC can only be fit by Equations 7 and 8, in which the rates are multiplied by an inhibition term, Ki/(Ki + [BA]), VAL=Va⋅Ki⋅[Pyr]/(([Pyr]+f⋅[BA])(Ki+[BA]))(Eq. 7) VPAC=Vc⋅Ki⋅f⋅[BA]/(([Pyr]+f⋅[BA])(Ki+[BA]))(Eq. 8) where Vc is the rate at which PAC would be formed at saturating benzaldehyde if there were no overall inhibition, and Ki is an apparent inhibition constant for benzaldehyde. The apparent inhibition constant Ki is about 25 mm for wild-type enzyme. Since we have not demonstrated the kinetic details of the competition between pyruvate and benzaldehyde and have not measured the dependence of the two rates over a range of benzaldehyde concentrations for all of the muteins described here, we define a measure of the preference of an enzyme for formation of R-PAC, R̃Bz, as the ratio of the initial rates of formation of R-PAC and acetolactate when the two are measured simultaneously in the presence of 30 mm each of pyruvate and benzaldehyde. For the wild-type AHAS II, the rates of the two competing processes are approximately equal when concentrations of benzaldehyde and pyruvate are both 30 mm, with specific rates of formation of acetolactate and R-PAC of 2.9 and 3.3 μmol min-1 mg-1, respectively. Thus, R̃Bz for wild-type AHAS II is 1.14 (Table I).Table IProperties of AHAS II and its mutantsEnzymeSpec. Act. (acetolactate)aSpecific activity (Spec.

Open table in a new tab The limited solubility of benzaldehyde did not allow us to determine whether very high concentrations of benzaldehyde inhibit acetolactate formation completely. However, we could examine the competition between benzaldehyde and 2-ketobutyrate for the HEThDP- intermediate by following the rate of PAC formation in the presence of a constant concentration of both benzaldehyde and pyruvate, with increasing amounts of 2-ketobutyrate. The measurements of the rates of PAC formation are inaccurate at the lowest concentrations of 2-ketobutyrate; because of the high preference of the enzyme for reaction with 2-ketobutyrate, its concentration drops rapidly before sufficient PAC has been formed for accurate analysis. However, the results at higher 2-ketobutyrate concentrations (Fig. 4) show clearly that PAC formation is essentially completely inhibited by the competing substrate 2-ketobutyrate. Mutation of Trp464 to another amino acid leads to an active enzyme with a greatly reduced preference for 2-ketobutyrate as second substrate (9Ibdah M. Bar-Ilan A. Livnah O. Schloss J.V. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16282-16291Google Scholar). The influence of replacement of this residue on the ability of the enzyme to form R-PAC seems to be totally unrelated to its effect on the specificity of the enzyme toward 2-ketobutyrate. Fig. 5 shows the behavior of mutein W464L. The preference of this mutein for formation of acetohydroxybutyrate (Fig. 5A) is 20-fold less than that of the wild-type, whereas its specificity for formation of R-PAC (Fig. 5B) is not very different from that of the wild type (R̃Bz = 0.9). The mutein W464Q shows a similar pattern of competition (Table I). The effects of replacement of Trp464 can be rationalized if its indole ring interacts with the methyl group of 2-ketobutyrate, as we have suggested (9Ibdah M. Bar-Ilan A. Livnah O. Schloss J.V. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16282-16291Google Scholar), stabilizing intermediates on the pathway to acetohydroxybutyrate but not to acetolactate. The inverse stereochemistry of the reaction with benzaldehyde (Fig. 2) implies that the aldehydic hydrogen points toward Trp464,so that there would be no significant interactions between benzaldehyde and this side chain in the course of the reaction, and the formation of PAC should be indifferent to mutation of Trp464. In accord with the suggestion that the carboxylate of a ketoacid and the aromatic ring of benzaldehyde must occupy similar regions of the active site, it is significant that ketoacids carrying both a carboxylate and a phenyl group, benzoylformate or phenylpyruvate, are neither substrates of AHAS II nor inhibitors of its reactions with pyruvate (data not shown). A Model for the Structure of HEThDP- in the site of AHAS II—The recently published structure of the complex of the catalytic subunits of AHAS from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the sulfonylurea herbicide chlorimuron ethyl (RCSB structural data base entry 1N0H) (11Pang S.S. Guddat L.W. Duggleby R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7639-7644Google Scholar) allows us to place these observations in a structural context and to consider which additional residues in the active site might make contacts with a reacting second ketoacid or benzaldehyde molecule. Fig. 6 shows a tentative structure for the relevant region of the active site of AHAS II, based on the structure of the yeast enzyme-chlorimuron ethyl (CIE) complex. The residues shown are present in most AHASs (including the yeast enzyme and AHAS II), and their structural neighbors are also identical in most AHASs or have conservative replacements. Table II relates the sequence numbering of the relevant residues in AHAS II and yeast AHAS.

Dietary iron absorption occurs in the duodenum via villus cells, a differentiated cell type involved in the transport of a variety of nutrients in the body. In mammals, iron homeostasis is controlled at the level of iron uptake rather than excretion, making iron absorption across the intestinal epithelial cell a key control point for iron homeostasis (for a review, see Ref. 1Andrews N.C.

Approximately 80% of Type 1 HH cases are due to a missense mutation in the HFE protein whereby a cysteine is mutated to a tyrosine in the α-3 domain of this major histocompatibility complex-related protein (2Feder J.N.

People with Type 1 HH, an autosomal recessive disorder, absorb too much iron across the intestine, which eventually leads to excessive iron deposition in the liver, heart, and pancreas (4Powell L.W.

HFE has been shown to interact with TFR1, but mutations in HFE that abrogate this interaction still cause changes in iron homeostasis leaving open the possibility that HFE interacts with other proteins involved in iron uptake, storage, or efflux (5Zhang A.S.

Many of the essential proteins involved in the control of iron absorption have been identified. Ferric iron (Fe3+) is reduced to the ferrous form (Fe2+) prior to absorption into the duodenum.

The effect of HFE expression on iron homeostasis in cell lines remains controversial, and its effect in different cell types within organs appears to vary. In some cell lines such as HeLa, HEK293, and H1299, HFE expression results in decreased intracellular iron levels (15Roy C.N. Carlson E.J. Anderson E.L. Basava A. Starnes S.M. Feder J.N. Enns C.A.

Similar to cell lines, lack of functional HFE in humans causes opposite effects on iron levels in different cell types of affected tissues. Early in Type I HH, Kupffer cells of the liver and intestinal enterocytes of the duodenum are ironpoor (21Francanzani A.L. Fargion S. Romano R. Piperno A. Arosio P. Ruggeri G. Ronchi G. Fiorelli G.

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of HFE expression on iron homeostasis in HT29 cells, a human colonic carcinoma cell line. These cells were chosen as a cell culture model to study the mechanism of HFE because our initial experiments demonstrated negligible expression of HFE but endogenous expression of the other genes involved in intestinal iron absorption and transport. We found that expression of HFE in this cell line led to both increased FT and steady state iron levels. The increased intracellular iron level was not due to an effect on TF-mediated iron uptake as has been observed in HeLa cells expressing HFE (16Roy C.N. Penny D.M. Feder J.N. Enns C.A. J. Biol.

Furthermore, these results give insight to the observation that different cell types in the body respond differently in their iron status when HFE is not functionally expressed (21Francanzani A.L.

The human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29 (ATCC no. 38-HTB) exhibits an undifferentiated phenotype under standard growth conditions. When these cells are grown without glucose, but in the presence of galactose, on porous membrane inserts they form tight junctions and an apical microvillus brush border membrane (29Godefroy O.

HT29 cells were seeded in 6-well culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, pH 7.4 (non-polarized) or on cell culture inserts (0.4-μm pore size, clear polyester membrane, Costar Inc.) with DMEM without glucose supplemented with 5 mm galactose and 10% fetal bovine serum, pH 7.4 on either side of the insert (polarized). Cells were fed fresh medium every 2 days. Non-polarized Cells—HT29 cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 6-well culture dishes and 2 days later treated for 24 h with one of the following: 10 μm FeCl3 complexed to nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), 1 mm ascorbate (Fe-Asc); 10 μm diferric TF; 100 μm Desferal (Df); or no treatment. The pH of the medium was 7.4 for Df and TF treatments and 5.5 for Fe-Asc treatments. The low pH was used to facilitate the function of the DMT1 transporter and mimic the acidic environment of the intestinal lumen. Untreated wells were included as controls at each pH. Polarized Cells—HT29 cells (1 × 106) were seeded onto 24-mm membrane inserts in 6-well dishes. After 15–18 days of culture on the inserts, they were treated for 24 h with one of the following: 100 μm Df on both the apical and basolateral sides, 10 μm Fe-Asc on the apical side, 10 μm TF on the basolateral side, or no treatment. The apical side of the insert contained buffer at pH 5.5 (25 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1.8 mm CaCl2), and the basolateral side contained the galactose-supplemented medium mentioned above. The cells maintained tight barriers as indicated by the maintenance of a pH differential between the basolateral and apical media.

Two hundred microliters of HEPES-buffered saline solution (280 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES acid, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.05) was added to 200 μl of 0.25 m CaCl2 and 3 μg of plasmid while vortexing. The DNA solution was incubated for 20 min at room temperature, added to 1.6 ml of fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum per well, and incubated with cells for 16 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh medium, and cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. Cells were split 1:4 into 100-mm dishes with medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Calbiochem) for selection. Colonies were selected ∼4 weeks later and screened by Western analysis for expression of HFE using rabbit anti-HFE (1:10,000 dilution, EX1 no. 137, a gift from J. Feder) and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution, Chemicon). The resulting fWTHFE/HT29 and fW81AHFE/HT29 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml G418. RNA was isolated from HT29 cells using the RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) and treated with 10 units of DNase (Roche Applied Science) to remove any contaminating genomic DNA. cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Samples were diluted 1:5 after cDNA synthesis, and PCR using GAPDH primers spanning an intron/exon junction was performed to check cDNA yield and confirm the absence of genomic DNA contamination in samples containing no reverse transcriptase. qRT-PCR was carried out in triplicate on each sample for each gene in at least three independent experiments using the SYBR Green detection system on an ABI PRISM 7900 machine (Applied Biosystems).

Blood. 2004; 103: 1509-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and the ΔΔCT method (53Applied BiosystemsApplied Biosystems User Bulletin No. 2. Foster City, CA, 2001: 11Google Scholar). Briefly the threshold cycle (CT) indicates the fractional cycle number at which the amount of amplified target reaches a fixed threshold. The difference in threshold cycles for target (gene of interest) and reference (GAPDH)(CT-Target – CT-Reference) is ΔCT. The difference between the ΔCT of interest and that of a base-line cDNA calibrator is ΔΔCT. The -fold change in mRNA expression between these two, the amount of target normalized to an endogenous reference and relative to a base-line cDNA calibrator normalized to an endogenous reference, is given by 2–ΔΔCT. In order for this calculation to be valid, the efficiencies of target and reference amplifications must be approximately equal across a range of template concentrations. All primer sets used in these studies were validated against the reference primers (GAPDH) to ensure such efficiency. Validation was determined by plotting the log of template concentration versus the ratio of the CT of the gene of interest to the CT of GAPDH. A slope less than or equal to 0.1 indicated an acceptably low variation between the amplification efficiencies of the target and reference. HT29 cells were lysed with NET-Triton (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) with 1% Triton X-100) to make whole cell extracts, and protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Whole cell lysates (30 μg) were diluted with 2× Laemmli buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), boiled for 5 min, subjected to electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, and transferred to nitrocellulose.

Subconfluent HT29 cells (parent, fWTHFE, and fW81AHFE) grown in 6-well dishes were washed twice and equilibrated in DMEM, 20 mm HEPES for 15 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Wash medium was replaced with 1 ml of 200 nm55Fe-NTA (NTA in 40-fold excess) in DMEM, 20 mm HEPES supplemented with 2 mg/ml ovalbumin. After 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 min of uptake at 37 °C, 5% CO2, excess 55Fe was stripped from the cell surface by washing twice with 2 ml of 5 mm EDTA, phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. Solubilization detergent (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% NaOH) was added to the cells, mixed with 6 ml of UniverSol scintillation fluid (ICN), and counted for 10 min in a scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000SC). Subconfluent HT29 cells (parent, fWTHFE, and fW81AHFE) grown in 6-well dishes were washed twice with DMEM, 20 mm HEPES and equilibrated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 15 min. The medium was replaced with 200 nm55Fe-NTA (NTA in 40-fold excess) in DMEM, 20 mm HEPES supplemented with 2 mg/ml ovalbumin and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 3 h. This time point was chosen to allow sufficient time for iron transport across the cell, but it was not long enough for FT synthesis to begin. After 3 h of uptake, the radioactive medium was removed, cells were quickly washed twice at room temperature with 5 mm EDTA, phosphate-buffered saline to remove extracellular or nonspecific 55Fe from the cell surface, and 1 ml of efflux medium (DMEM, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm non-radioactive Fe-NTA) was added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 0, 5, 15, or 30 min. The plates were quickly washed twice with room temperature 5 mm EDTA, phosphate-buffered saline to again remove any extracellular 55Fe, and the cells were solubilized as described above. Six milliliters of UniverSol (ICN) were added to both the efflux media samples and the solubilized cells and counted as described above. Average values are represented ± S.D.

Establishment of HT29 Cells as a System to Study Iron Homeostasis—To determine whether HT29 cells endogenously express the key genes involved in iron absorption in the intestine, mRNA expression of these genes was examined by qRT-PCR and normalized to the internal standard, GAPDH.

HT29 cells also express detectable levels of HEPH mRNA, whereas HeLa cells do not (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Thus, the expression of FPN1, DMT1, and HEPH in HT29 cells is consistent with the phenotype of cells specialized for iron transport. HT29 cells were grown on permeable filter inserts and induced to polarize to test whether they exhibited enterocyte-like behavior with respect to an expression pattern of genes involved in iron transport. RNA was isolated from HT29 cells every 2 days for 3 weeks following seeding on cell culture inserts, and the mRNA expression levels of genes related to iron metabolism were examined. Changes in mRNA at each time point relative to mRNA levels after 1 day of growth were plotted for each gene after samples were normalized to the GAPDH control (Fig. 1C).

When plated on surfaces coated with the high affinity ligand invasin, β1B-integrin-expressing cells spread by forming filopodia with distinct adhesive phosphotyrosine complexes at the tips, without signs of lamellipodia. This suggested that the β1B-integrin mediated a partial signaling sufficient for formation of filopodia but insufficient for lamellipodia formation. When screening for proteins present in the distal filopodial phosphotyrosine complexes of β1B cells, p130Cas and the filopodia proteins vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and talin were found, whereas the typical focal complex proteins focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and vinculin were not. Invasin-promoted adhesion induced complex formation of p130Cas and the adapter Crk. Moreover, Crk together with Dock180 were present at the filopodial tips of β1B-integrin-expressing cells, and there was a prominent Rac1 activation. Expression of dominant negative variants of p130Cas or CrkII blocked β1B-integrin-mediated filopodia formation, indicating that this signaling scaffold is central in this process.

Integrins are a large family of at least 24 heterodimeric transmembrane receptors formed by 18 α and 8 β subunits (1van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). They are involved in bidirectional signaling across the cell membrane and influence several cellular events including cell spreading, cell migration, and cell survival (1van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Integrin receptors link the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton at sites known as cell-matrix adhesions, which are multimolecular structures where the extracellular matrix, integrins, filamentous actin (F-actin), 1The abbreviations used are: F-actin, filamentous actin; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; VASP, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SH2, Src homology 2; SH3, Src homology 3; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding domain.1The abbreviations used are: F-actin, filamentous actin; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; VASP, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SH2, Src homology 2; SH3, Src homology 3; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding domain. F-actin-stabilizing proteins, and proteins involved in cell signaling are found (2Burridge K. Nuckolls G. Otey C. Pavalko F. Simon K. Turner C. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 32: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 3Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells form different types of cell-matrix adhesions that are morphologically distinct and are divided into subtypes such as focal contacts/focal adhesions and focal complexes. Focal contacts represent the relatively large and arrow-shaped cell-matrix adhesion structures mainly found at the basolateral plane of the cell, whereas focal complexes represent the small round-shaped cell-matrix adhesions usually present at the rim of lamellipodia (4Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). One protein family that regulates the cell-matrix adhesions and the actin cytoskeleton during cell spreading and migration is the Rho family of GTPases that includes Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 (5Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar, 6Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During stimulated migration of NIH3T3 cells, Cdc42 is activated and induces formation of thin protrusions rich in actin, known as microspikes or filopodia (7Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 8Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3711) Google Scholar). Activation of Rac1 promotes formation of lamellipodia, which are sheath-like protrusions (9Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar). Both Cdc42 and Rac1 regulate protrusive events and promote formation of the smaller focal complexes (5Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). RhoA is also activated and mediates formation of stress fibers and focal contacts that firmly anchor the cell to the substratum and allow retraction of the rear end of the cell (5Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar, 10Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3806) Google Scholar, 11Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Among the proteins found in cell-matrix adhesions are FAK, Src, Crk-associated substrate (p130Cas), talin, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), paxillin, and vinculin (12Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3583-3590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vinculin plays a central role in the mechanical coupling of integrins to the cytoskeleton as well as in related control of cytoskeletal mechanics, cell shape, and motility (13Samuels M. Ezzell R.M.

Talin is responsible for a conformational change of integrins to an active state, and it also links the receptor to the actin cytoskeleton (17Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 2002; 110: 587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). VASP, which also is found in the tip of filopodia, is involved in regulation of actin-based types of cell movement and promotes the formation of long actin filaments over branching (21Bear J.E.

Paxillin can interact with a variety of signaling proteins and is presumed to be involved in several signaling pathways as well as in anchoring of the actin cytoskeleton (23Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). FAK is a tyrosine kinase that is activated early in response to integrin stimulation and is involved in regulating the turnover of cell-matrix adhesions (24Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar, 25Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). This kinase, together with members of the Src family of cytosolic tyrosine kinases, binds and phosphorylates the docking proteins p130Cas and paxillin (26Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tachibana K. Urano T. Fujita H. Ohashi Y. Kamiguchi K. Iwata S. Hirai H. Morimoto C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29083-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated p130Cas can interact with Crk, which in turn binds Dock180, which is an unconventional Rac-guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates Rac1 (28Albert M.L. Kim J.I. Birge R.B.

In a previous study (33Gustavsson A. Armulik A. Brakebusch C. Fässler R. Johansson S. Fällman M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2669-2678PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that the high affinity β1-integrin ligand of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, invasin (34Isberg R.R. Leong J.M. Cell. 1990; 60: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 35Leong J.M. Fournier R.S. Isberg R.R.

Chem. 1991; 266: 24367-24375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was unable to bind to a β1-integrin-deficient cell line, GD25, unless this cell line had been transfected with either of two splice variants of β1-integrin, β1A or β1B. These splice variants are identical in the extracellular, transmembrane, and membrane-proximal 20 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail but differ at the end of the cytoplasmic tail (37Armulik A. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: D219-D227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The distal part of the β1A tail contains 21 amino acids encompassing two NPXY motifs, a serine and a double threonine phosphorylation site. The unique part of the β1B tail does not contain any known motifs important for the function of β1B when it localizes to the cell surface although there is a double lysine motif that can cause intracellular accumulation of β1B (37Armulik A. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: D219-D227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kee W.J. Li E.R. Watt F.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 78: 97-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The β1A splice variant is most commonly expressed and can cluster, form cell-matrix adhesions, and mediate signaling upon binding to fibronectin or laminin. The β1B splice variant, on the other hand, is only expressed in a few human cell types and is unable to bind fibronectin unless stimulated with manganese ions that force the integrin into an active conformation, but even when binding an extracellular matrix ligand, the β1B variant fails to form detectable cell-matrix adhesions or induce signaling through FAK (37Armulik A. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: D219-D227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39de Melker A.A. Sonnenberg A. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We previously showed that GD25 cells complemented with β1A (GD25β1A) bound invasin with high affinity and spread readily when plated onto surfaces coated with this ligand (33Gustavsson A. Armulik A. Brakebusch C. Fässler R. Johansson S. Fällman M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2669-2678PubMed Google Scholar). GD25 cells complemented with β1B (GD25β1B), on the other hand, exhibited reduced binding and a spreading that was limited to distinct peripheral assemblies where β1-integrin co-localized with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (33Gustavsson A. Armulik A. Brakebusch C. Fässler R. Johansson S. Fällman M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2669-2678PubMed Google Scholar). The finding of the Tyr(P) complexes indicated that the β1B-integrin retained some signaling capacity, and in this study, we have used this to explore the signaling associated with this event of spreading. Materials—The following antibodies were purchased: mouse anti-FAK2A7 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), mouse anti-paxillin, mouse anti-Crk, rabbit anti-Tyr(P), mouse anti-Tyr(P) (PY20), mouse anti-Rac1, mouse anti-Cdc42, mouse anti-p130Cas, Tyr(P)-RC20:HRPO (Transduction Laboratories), goat anti-DOCK180 (N-19), goat anti-DOCK180 (C-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-human VASP (IE273; ALEXIS Biochemicals), mouse anti-talin, mouse anti-human vinculin (Sigma), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, lissamine-conjugated donkey anti-goat, rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, coumarine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc.). Polyclonal anti-p130Cas was kindly provided by Dr. J. T. Parsons (Department of Microbiology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). Alexa Fluor® 488 phalloidin, Alexa Fluor® 568 phalloidin, and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to lissamine were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Other reagents used were PP1 (Alexis Corp.), PP3 (Calbiochem), platelet-derived growth factor (R&D Systems), and the glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine (GRGDS) peptide (Bachem Feinchemicalien AG). The GST-invΔ1 (33Gustavsson A. Armulik A. Brakebusch C. Fässler R. Johansson S. Fällman M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2669-2678PubMed Google Scholar) protein was purified according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmids—Expression vectors encoding GFPp130Cas and GFPΔ SDp130Cas were constructed by insertion of PCR fragments from pRc/CMV-Cas(ctMyc) encoding murine p130Cas (40Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) into the pCB6GFP-N or pCB6GFP-C expression vector, respectively (41Reckmann I. Higley S. Way M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To generate GFPΔSDp130Cas, amino acids 117–420 were deleted. GFPCrkII, GFPCrkII SH2 (amino acids 1–110), and GFPCrkII SH3 (amino acids 110–235) were obtained by PCR from pE/L-GFPCrkII encoding murine CrkII and inserted into pCB6GFP-N. The constructs were validated by sequencing. The Rc/CMV-Cas(ctMyc) construct was kindly provided by Dr. S. Hanks (Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center). The pCB6GFP expression vectors, pE/L-GFP-CrkII (42Scaplehorn N. Holmstrom A. Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Way M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 740-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), pCB6/GFP-L61Rac1, N17Rac1, L61Cdc42, and N17Cdc42 constructs (43McGee K. Zettl M. Way M. Fällman M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. M. Way (Cancer Research, UK). GST-p21-activated kinase (PAK)-Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding domain (CRIB) (44Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. B. Hallberg (Department of Medical Biosciences/Pathology, Umea University, Sweden). Cell Culture—The cell lines GD25β1A and GD25β1B have been described previously (45Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 46Armulik A. Svineng G. Wennerberg K. Fässler R. Johansson S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% heat inactive fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and puromycin (20 μg/ml). To transfect the cells, they were incubated with a mixture of 3 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and 0.8 μg of plasmid for 5 h in antibiotic-free conditions, whereafter the medium was replaced and the cells were incubated for 14 h prior to spreading. Cell Spreading and Immunofluorescence Staining—Cell spreading and immunofluorescence staining were performed as previously described (33Gustavsson A. Armulik A. Brakebusch C. Fässler R. Johansson S. Fällman M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2669-2678PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, coverslips were coated with GST-invΔ1 (10 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C and blocked with 1% heat-treated bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were detached and incubated in serum-free DMEM containing cycloheximide (25 μg/ml; Sigma) on bovine serum albumin-blocked Petri dishes for 40 min. Thereafter, the GRGDS peptide (0.1 mg/ml) was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 20 min. Cycloheximide and GRGDS was used to inhibit the GD25 fibroblasts from synthesizing extracellular matrix proteins and to block binding to αvβ3-integrins, respectively. After this, 2 × 105 cells were allowed to attach on invasin-coated coverslips at 37 °C for 3 h. Unattached cells were washed away, and the remaining cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and further processed for double or triple immunofluorescence labeling. Samples were mounted onto microscope slides using ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes). The pictures were captured using a microscope (Zeiss Axioskop 50) and a CCD camera (ORCA; Hamamatsu) and processed using Adobe software (Adobe). The inhibition of Src family kinases by PP1 or the negative control, PP3, was performed as described above with the exception that the 60-min pretreatment with cycloheximide was exchanged with a 45-min pretreatment with PP1 or PP3 at various concentrations prior to seeding. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were trypsinized, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in serum-free DMEM containing cycloheximide (25 μg/ml; Sigma) before being plated on GST-invasin (10 μg/ml) or bovine serum albumin. The cells were allowed to attach at 37 °C for 60 min and thereafter were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) for 15 min on ice. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min and precleared with Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) coated with mouse γ-globulin (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose beads precoupled to anti-Crk antibodies. The beads were washed twice with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by semidry transfer to Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp.). Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (RC20) and then enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was stripped by incubation in 1 m glycine, pH 2.5, for 30 min, whereafter it was divided and subjected to Western blot with anti-p130Cas or anti-Crk antibodies. Pull-down—The plasmid-cured Y. pseudotuberculosis strain YPIII (47Bölin I. Norlander L. Wolf-Watz H. Infect. Immun. 1982; 37: 506-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to stimulate β1-integrins to investigate Cdc42 and Rac1 activation. An overnight culture of YPIII, grown in Luria broth at 26 °C, was centrifuged down, resuspended in antibiotic-free cell culture medium, and incubated for 1 h at 26 °C. This culture was then used to infect a 15-cm dish with cells at 75% confluence (starved for 17 h), at a multiplicity of infection of 5000:1. The infection was carried out at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cells were lysed in the pull-down lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture mix. As a positive control for Rac1 activation, the cells were treated with platelet-derived growth factor (3 ng/ml) for 2 min prior to lysis. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were saved as the cell lysates. The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay, and 1300 μg of the cell lysate was incubated with 30 μg of GST-PAK-CRIB (purified as described previously (44Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar)) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 12 mm MgCl2), whereafter bound GTP-Rac together with aliquots of cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12%) and Western blot with anti-Rac1 antibodies. β1B-Integrins Have a Partial Signaling and Mediate Formation of Filopodia When Binding to Invasin—To characterize the β1-integrin-mediated spreading, β1A- and β1B-expressing GD25 cells were allowed to spread on invasin-coated plates; triple-stained with phalloidin, wheat germ agglutinin, and anti-Tyr(P) antibodies; and subjected to both fluorescent and phase contrast light microscopy (Fig. 1A). Fluorescent phalloidin and wheat germ agglutinin were employed to visualize the F-actin architecture and cell edges, respectively. Cells expressing β1A-integrins became flat and spread with the typical star-like morphology of fibroblasts where lamellipodia and distinct cell-matrix adhesions were apparent (Fig. 1, A and B). On the other hand, cells expressing β1B-integrins had a round cell body with long extended F-actin structures consisting of fine threads that resembled filopodia, and there were no detectable lamellipodia-like F-actin structures or focal contacts (Fig. 1, A and B). Moreover, the tips of the thin filopodial extensions contained distinct assemblies of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 1A). There were no such long filopodia-like structures in the GD25β1A cells; the protrusive elements were instead broader lamellipodia-like extensions and some short filopodia-like structures (Fig. 1A). The initial spreading by β1B-integrin-expressing cells was delayed compared with that of cells expressing the β1A variant but was equal after 1 h, where 60% of all attached cells exhibited spread morphology with filopodia or lamellipodia, respectively (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. 1). Maximal spreading of β1B cells was detected after 2 h, but after longer periods of time cells started to detach (Fig. 1B), where very few cells adhered after 6 h (data not shown). Coating density of invasin did not influence the observed spreading behavior; 1–25 μg/ml of invasin resulted in similar spreading for both GD25β1A and GD25β1B cells (data not shown). Upon plating on poly-l-lysine, no spreading at all could be observed (data not shown), which confirmed that the filopodia formed by the β1B-expressing cells was an effect of invasin binding to the β1-integrin receptor. This indicates that the β1B-integrin receptor can mediate spreading with filopodia when binding to invasin but that signaling for lamellipodia formation is impaired. This system therefore provides a unique tool to dissect the complex signaling associated with filopodia formation, which may allow identification of molecular events in spreading that takes place without the formation of lamellipodia. Interestingly, GD25β1B cells that had spread with filopodia and then been ripped off during sample preparation left remnants of the phosphotyrosine-containing tip complexes on the coverslip (Fig. 1C). This shows that the tips of these filopodia are indeed attached to the invasin-coated coverslips, which is supported by our previous finding that the β1-integrins localize to these filopodial tips (33Gustavsson A. Armulik A. Brakebusch C. Fässler R. Johansson S. Fällman M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2669-2678PubMed Google Scholar). Src family kinases, especially Src and Fyn, are associated with integrin signaling and are activated upon integrin activation (48Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Src family kinases were important for the observed invasin-promoted filopodia formation by GD25β1B cells, the Src inhibitor PP1 was employed. This inhibitor blocked filopodia spreading of GD25β1B (Fig. 1D) and reduced the amount of detectable Tyr(P) in the tip complexes at lower concentrations (data not shown). As expected, PP1 also blocked spreading of GD25β1A cells (data not shown), whereas the negative control, PP3, did not affect the spreading of the cells (Fig. 1D). To explore the partial signaling from the β1B-integrin receptor, we aimed to identify proteins present within the Tyr(P) complexes at the filopodial tips. GD25β1B cells spread on invasin were subjected to a screen of immunostaining with antibodies directed against different proteins that are known to localize to focal contacts (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. 2). This screening revealed that VASP and p130Cas were present at sites enriched in Tyr(P), at the tips of filopodia in GD25β1B cells (Fig. 2A). FAK, vinculin, and paxillin were completely absent from these sites and mainly localized to a perinuclear region of the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the filopodial tip complexes are distinct from focal contacts and that FAK, vinculin, and paxillin are dispensable for filopodia formation. Talin could also be detected in association with the sites enriched in Tyr(P), but the localization was not as distinct as that seen with p130Cas and VASP, since talin also was present in punctate structures along the filopodial extensions (Fig. 2A). However, a closer examination of all detectable filopodial Tyr(P) complexes of the stained cells revealed that the majority of these contained talin (77%) as well as VASP (74%) and p130Cas (82%) (Fig. 2B). In GD25β1A cells that were stained in parallel, all of the focal adhesion markers including FAK, vinculin, and paxillin localized to distal protrusive structures, but also here talin was less distinct (Fig. 2A). Hence, the Tyr(P) complexes at the tips of β1B-mediated filopodia contain only a subset of proteins that can be found in focal contacts. p130Cas-Crk Is Required for Filopodia Formation in GD25β1B Cells—The previous finding that p130Cas was tyrosine-phosphorylated in GD25β1B cells upon adhesion to invasin (33Gustavsson A. Armulik A. Brakebusch C. Fässler R. Johansson S. Fällman M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2669-2678PubMed Google Scholar), together with the present observation that p130Cas localized to the tip of invasin-promoted filopodia, suggested a role for this docking protein in filopodia formation. To investigate this, we transfected GD25β1B cells with GFP-tagged full-length p130Cas and a GFP-tagged dominant negative variant of p130Cas (ΔSDp130Cas), which previously has been shown to impair cell migration (49Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In nearly 50% of the adherent transfected cells, expression of full-length p130Cas induced formation of lamellipodia-like structures between the bases of extending filopodia, which, as in the corresponding mock-transfected cells, contained distinct peripheral Tyr(P) complexes (Fig. 3, A and F). Interestingly, the expression of ΔSDp130Cas in GD25β1B cells completely blocked the filopodia spreading and assembly of Tyr(P) seen in nontransfected or GFP-transfected GD25β1B cells (Figs. 1 and 3, A and F). This suggests that signaling by p130Cas is crucial for invasin-stimulated f"

The crystal structure of the MMAB sequence homologue from Thermoplasma acidophilum (TA1434; GenBank™ identification number gi|16082403) was determined to a resolution of 1.5 Å. TA1434 was confirmed to be an ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase, which depended absolutely on divalent metal ions (Mg2+ > Mn2+ > Co2+) and only used ATP or dATP as adenosyl donors. The apparent Km of TA1434 was 110 μm (kcat = 0.23 s-1) for ATP, 140 μm (kcat = 0.11 s-1) for dATP, and 3 μm (kcat = 0.18 s-1) for cobalamin. TA1434 is a trimer in solution and in the crystal structure, with each subunit composed of a five-helix bundle. The location of disease-related point mutations and other residues conserved among the homologues of TA1434 suggest that the active site lies at the junctions between the subunits. Mutations in TA1434 that correspond to the disease-related mutations resulted in proteins that were inactive for ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase activity in vitro, confirming that these mutations define the molecular basis of the human disease.

Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is an important cofactor in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. A wide variety of cobalamin-dependent metabolic reactions are known, including acetyl-CoA synthesis, generation of deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis, methane production in methanogenic archaea, and fermentation of small molecules (1Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Bobbi T.A. Annul. Rev. Microbial. 1996; 50: 137-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The metabolic requirement for cobalamin varies among different organisms. Some bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, use the vitamin but do not synthesize it (2Dobson C.M. Way T. Lecher D. Nadir H. Nearing M. Lerner-Ellis J.P. Hudson T.J. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), whereas other bacteria have no need for it (1Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Bobbi T.A. Annul. Rev. Microbial. 1996; 50: 137-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Animals require cobalamin but must rely on dietary sources, and it is believed that plants and fungi neither synthesize nor use cobalamin (1Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Bobbi T.A. Annul. Rev. Microbial. 1996; 50: 137-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 3Martens J.H. Barg H. Warren M.J. Jahn D. Appl. Microbial. Biotechnol. 2002; 58: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). A characteristic that distinguishes cobalamin from all other vitamins is that only certain bacteria and archaea possess the ability for its de novo synthesis (3Martens J.H. Barg H. Warren M.J. Jahn D. Appl. Microbial. Biotechnol. 2002; 58: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 4Raux E. Schubert H.L. Warren M.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1880-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).Prior to its use in the cell, cobalamin must be metabolized into one of two biologically active forms, adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) 1The abbreviations used are: AdoCbl, adenosylcobalamin; HOCbl, hydroxocobalamin; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous diffraction/dispersion; MeCbl, methylcobalamin; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.1The abbreviations used are: AdoCbl, adenosylcobalamin; HOCbl, hydroxocobalamin; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous diffraction/dispersion; MeCbl, methylcobalamin; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. and methylcobalamin (MeCbl). In humans, these cofactors are known to be used in two enzyme systems. The first enzyme, methionine synthase, uses MeCbl to produce methionine from homocysteine (2Dobson C.M. Way T. Lecher D. Nadir H. Nearing M. Lerner-Ellis J.P. Hudson T.J. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 5Harding C.O. Arnold G. Barness L.A.

The second enzyme, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, uses AdoCbl as a coenzyme to convert methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, which can then enter the trichloroacetic acid cycle (6Leal N.A. Park S.D.

This AdoCbl-dependent reaction is important in the catabolism of methionine, valine, threonine, isoleucine, odd chain fatty acids, and cholesterol (8Drennan C.L. Matthews R.G. Rosenblatt D.S.

Warren M.J. Jahn D. Appl. Microbial. Biotechnol. 2002; 58: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 4Raux E. Schubert H.L. Warren M.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1880-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The conversion of cobalamin to AdoCbl and MeCbl involves the reduction of the cobalt ion from a Co(III) oxidation state to Co(I) and then the addition of the functional ligand (2Dobson C.M. Way T. Lecher D. Nadir H. Nearing M. Lerner-Ellis J.P. Hudson T.J. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10Dobson C.M. Way T. Lecher D.

In the formation of AdoCbl, the 5′-deoxyadenosyl moiety is transferred from ATP and covalently attached to the Co(I) by an ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase (11Fonseca M.V. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32101-32108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). There are three families of adenosyltranserases (EutT, CobA, and PduO) based on amino acid sequences and the pathways with which they are associated.Several inherited diseases are caused by mutations in genes encoding cobalamin metabolic enzymes. These mutations usually cause severe disease early in life, but symptoms can also appear later (12Rosenblatt D.S. Fenton W.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Valle D. Sly W.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3897-3933Google Scholar). Several different complementation groups are known; cblA, cblB, and cblH have defects related to AdoCbl synthesis, cblE and cblG, have MeCbl defects, and cblC, cblD, and cblF involve synthesis of both cofactors. Depending on the complementation group, patients present with either homocystinuria or methylmalonic aciduria or both. Increased levels of methylmalonic acid are associated with developmental retardation and infant mortality (7Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

To understand the relationship between the mutations in MMAB and its function, we undertook a biochemical and structural analysis of TA1434, an MMAB sequence homologue from Thermoplasma acidophilum that has 32% sequence identity to MMAB and 35% identity to the PduO adenosyltransferase in Salmonella. Enzyme assays confirmed that TA1434 is indeed an ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase, with higher activity than that reported for PduO or CobA. The crystal structure for TA1434 showed that it is a trimer, with each subunit composed of a five-helix bundle. Two disease-related mutations are located in a highly conserved region at the subunit interface, which is the likely active site. In TA1434, mutations that are homologous to disease-causing mutations in the human MMAB resulted in a properly folded yet inactive protein, providing biochemical evidence for the effect of these mutations in cblB patients.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Hydroxocobalamin (HOCbl) was from Sigma. Titanium (III) citrate was prepared as described previously (13Bobbi T.A. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1423-1427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning, Purification, and Crystallographic Studies—Cloning, purification, and crystallization experiments have been described elsewhere (14Christendat D. Saridakis V. Dharamsi A. Bochkarev A. Pai E.F. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24608-24612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For the preparation of selenomethionine-enriched protein, ATP: cobalamin adenosyltransferase was expressed in a methionine auxotroph strain B834(DE3) of E. coli and purified under the same conditions as native ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase with the addition of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol in all buffers. The morphology of single crystals of ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase is cubic, and the crystals appear after ∼24 h in crystallization set-ups containing ammonium phosphate as the precipitant. The native and selenomethionine-enriched crystals selected for diffraction experiments were grown in 0.4 m ammonium phosphate, 4% methyl-pentanediol, and 5% glycerol at 20 °C. The crystals belonged to the space group P23, with the unit cell parameters a = b = c = 89.1 Å. The Matthew's coefficient, VM, was determined as 3.2 Å3 Da-1, resulting in a solvent content of 61% with a single molecule in each asymmetric unit.X-Ray Diffraction and Structure Determination—A three-wave-length MAD experiment was carried out at 100 K on beamline ID19, Advanced Photon Source, and data from a native crystal of ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase were also collected on beamline ID19, Advanced Photon Source. MAD and native data were integrated and scaled with the DENZO/SCALEPACK suite of programs. Data collection statistics are presented in Table I. SOLVE was used to locate the selenium sites and calculate the phases, and RESOLVE was used to modify the density and build a portion of the model. Electron density visualization and model building were done with O. Rigid body and simulated annealing torsion angle refinement were normally followed by individual B-factor refinement and performed using CNS 1.0. Several rounds of refinement were combined with model rebuilding in O after inspection of both 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps.

Protein standards included aldolase, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and cytochrome c. Chromatography was performed at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.ATP:Cob(I)alamin Adenosyltransferase Assay—Adenosyltransferase assays were carried out under anaerobic conditions using a modification of a previously published method (15Johnson C.L. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobbi T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The assay mixtures (2 ml) were incubated at 70 °C (or at indicated temperature) under anaerobic conditions in 1-cm glass cuvettes closed by rubber stoppers (Suba Seal) and preflushed with argon for 5 min. The assay components (Master Mix; 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.4 mm ATP, 1.6 mm KH2PO4, and 2.8 mm MgCl2) were sparged with argon for 10 min and transferred anaerobically (using a Hamilton syringe) to the anaerobic spectrophotometric cuvettes. The anaerobic solutions of HOCbl (in methanol; 0.05 mm final concentration) and titanium (III) citrate (1 mm final concentration) were introduced by Hamilton syringes, and after 30 s of argon sparging the cuvettes were incubated at room temperature for 10 min (to allow reduction of HOCbl to cob(I)alamin). After 5 min of equilibration at 70 °C (in a thermo-jacketed cuvette holder), the reactions were initiated by the addition of an anaerobic solution of the enzyme (20-50 μg of protein), and the decrease in absorbance at 388 nm was monitored. The activity was quantified using ϵ = 24.9 mm-1 cm-1.The steady-state kinetic constants for ATP, dATP, and HOCbl were determined under the same conditions as described above except for substrate concentrations. These activity measurements were made for incubation mixtures ranging in substrate concentration from 0.01 to 0.8 mm for ATP (in the presence of 50 μm HOCbl), 0.025 to 1.5 mm for dATP (in the presence of 50 μm HOCbl), and 1 to 50 μm for HOCbl (in the presence of 0.4 mm ATP). All values were in duplicate, and the appropriate S.D. values are given. Data were analyzed with the kinetic analysis program GraphPad Prism® 4 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA), and kinetic parameters were obtained by non-linear curve fitting using the saturation kinetic equation v = (Vmax [S])/(Km + [S]).Site-directed Mutagenesis of TA1434 —Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using QuikChange™ (Stratagene). The mutagenic oligonucleotides used to prepare all of the TA1434 mutants are listed in Table III. DNA encoding wild-type TA1434 cloned into pET15B was used as a template for mutagenesis. Briefly, 25 ng of template DNA was incubated with the appropriate mutagenic primers, dNTPs, and Pfu DNA polymerase using the cycling parameters recommended in the supplier's manual. Following the temperature cycling steps, DpnI was added to each amplification reaction and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h followed by transformation of the mutagenized plasmid into XL2-Blue cells. Plasmid was purified from the resulting colonies using the Qia-prep Spin Mini Prep kit (Qiagen), and all mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.Table IIIATP:Cobalamin adenosyltransferase mutagenic oligonucleotidesMutationOrientationSequenceR119AForward5′-tcg ctc cac atg gca GCG gct gtt tcg agg agg ctt gag-3′Reverse5′-ctc aag cct cct cga aac agc CGC tgc cat gtg gag cga-3′R119WForward5′-tcg ctc cac atg gca TGG gct gtt tcg agg agg ctt gag-3′Reverse5′-ctc aag cct cct cga aac agc CCA tgc cat gtg gag cga-3′R124AForward5′-cgt gct gtt tcg agg GCG ctt gag agg agg ata-3′Reverse5′-tat ctt ctt cac aag CGC cct cga aac agc acg-3′R124FForward5′-cgt gct gtt tcg agg TTT ctt gag agg agg ata-3′Reverse5′-tat cct cct ctc aag AAA cct cga aac agc acg-3′R124KForward5′-cgt gct gtt tcg agg AAA ctt gag agg agg ata-3′Reverse5′-tat cct cct ctc aac TTT cct cga aac agc acg-3′R124WForward5′-cgt gct gtt tcg agg TGG ctt gag agg agg ata-3′Reverse5′-tat ctt ctt ctc aag CCA cct cga aac agc acg-3′E126AForward5′-gtt tcg agg agg ctt GCG agg agg ata gtt gcg-3Reverse5′-cgc aac tat cct cct CGC aag cct cct cga aac-3′E126KForward5′-gtt tcg agg agg ctt AAA agg agg ata gtt gcg-3′Reverse5′-cgc aac tat cct cct TTT aag cct cct cga aac-3′ Open table in a new tab Purification of ATP:Cobalamin Adenosyltransferase Mutants—Expression of the mutants yielded between 10 and 15 mg of soluble, recombinant proteins per liter of cell culture. All of the mutants were purified in the same manner as wild-type ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase and appeared as single bands after SDS-PAGE.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSequence Analysis—The primary amino acid sequence of the conserved 177-residue protein TA1434 was used to search the NCBI protein data base for sequence homologues. A number of homologues, mostly annotated as hypothetical proteins, were found in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes, with sequence identities ranging from 32 to 77%. The ClustalW alignment of TA1434 with eight homologues is shown in Fig. 2. TA1434 has 35% sequence identity to PduO and 32% identity to MMAB, which are ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferases from Salmonella typhi and humans, respectively, suggesting that TA1434 also has this activity. There are 22 residues that are absolutely conserved among the homologues. The conserved residues Arg-119, Arg-124, and Glu-126 in TA1434 correspond to Arg-186, Arg-191, and Glu-193 in the human MMAB, which are mutated residues in cblB patients (2Dobson C.M. Way T. Lecher D. Nadir H. Nearing M. Lerner-Ellis J.P. Hudson T.J. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Because of the relatively weak sequence identity of TA1434 with human MMAB, we first confirmed that TA1434 had ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase activity by using an adenosyltransferase assay (shown below) and, thus, we will refer to TA1434 as ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase.Fig. 2Partial alignment of TA1434 (tr|Q9HIA7) with sequence homologues. Sequences shown are for the hypothetical protein (HP) TV0097 from Thermoplasma volcanium (tr|Q97CK4), HP SSO0588 from Sulfolobus solfataricus (tr|Q9UWZ1), the YVQK protein from Bacillus subtilis (tr|O34899), HP from Klebsiella pneumoniae (tr|Q48424), PduO from S. typhi (tr|Q8Z5L4), Mus musculus MMAB (sp|Q9D273), Homo sapiens MMAB (sp|Q96EY8), and a putative ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase from Porphyromonas gingivalis (tr|Q7MVB4). The boxed amino acids are conserved in an alignment that includes four additional homologues (tr|Q970Z7, tr|Q9KCH6, tr|Q9RTW5, and tr|Q980D7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Structure Determination—The structure of ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase was determined by the MAD method using selenium as the anomalous scatterer. SOLVE was able to locate four of five selenium sites, and the figure of merit was 62. The resulting electron density was of high quality and allowed the automated model-building segment of RESOLVE to identify and build 124 of 177 amino acids from 30-70, 77-98, and 113-171. Amino acids 71-76 and 99-112 were built manually. The final model consists of 148 residues, from residue 23 to residue 170, and 170 water molecules. The first 22 and the last 7 residues were disordered and could not be built in the electron density map. The model was refined to 1.55 Å resolution with an Rcryst of 0.197 and an Rfree of 0.215. According to PROCHECK, 99.6% of the residues are in the most favored regions, and there are no residues in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (16Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).Structure Overview—ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase consists of a five-helix bundle (helices α1, α2, α3, α4, and α5) (Fig. 3A). Helix α1 extends from residue 25 to residue 45, helix α2 continues from residue 48 to residue 71, helix α3 runs from residues 80 to 97, helix α4 extends from residues 110 to 133, and helix α5 runs from residue 141 to residue 163. The topology of the bundle is 12354. There is a right-handed twist in the helical bundle, and helices α2 and α5 contain kinks. The interactions between helices α1 and α2 are predominantly hydrophobic, whereas the interactions between helices α2 and α3 are predominantly ionic. A combination of hydrophobic and polar interactions are formed between helices α3 and α5. Mostly polar interactions are found between helices α5 and α4, and hydrophobic interactions are formed between helices α4 and α1.Fig. 3Structure of ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase. A, ribbon diagram of one subunit of ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase. The monomer is composed of a single domain with a five-helix bundle core. The secondary structure elements are labeled α1-α5. B, ribbon diagram of trimeric ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase. The programs MOLSCRIPT and RASTER 3D were used in the production of the figures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Oligomeric Structure—ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase was shown to be trimeric (Fig. 3B) using gel filtration studies (data not shown). This is consistent with analysis of the crystal structure. The oligomer interface is formed by the interaction of helix α2 from one subunit with helix α4 of another subunit and is stabilized by a combination of ionic and hydrophobic interactions. The ionic interactions that are formed between subunits A and B consist of the following: OE1 of Glu-27A and NE of Arg-127B; OE1 of Glu-27A and NH1 of Arg-128B; and OE2 of Glu-34A and NH1 of Arg-124B. These interactions are repeated between subunits B and C as well as between subunits C and A. Other ionic interactions at the interface are mediated through water molecules. A hydrophobic patch is formed between residues Phe-56A, Phe-63A, Val-105B and Trp-171B. This patch is also found between subunits B and C and between C and A.Active Site—The putative active site in ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase was identified by examining the location of the conserved residues. Twenty-one of the twenty-two highly conserved residues are located at the interface of two subunits but are not involved in subunit packing, suggesting a conserved function. Mutations in two of these residues are found in the MMAB gene in patients with the cblB disease of cobalamin metabolism, further supporting a key role for these residues. This region is formed at the interface of two subunits and is made up of helices α1 and α2 from one subunit and helices α3, α4, and α5 from the other subunit. The electrostatic surface representation of ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase shows that this same region is positively charged, which would allow the negatively charged ATP residue to be directed toward this area (Fig. 4). The disordered loops (residues 1-22 and 171-177) also map to this location of the protein. The active site in the apo-form of another ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase, CobA, was also disordered but became clearly defined in the presence of ligands (17Bauer C.B. Fonseca M.V. Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Thompson T.B. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The residues important for ATP and HOCbl binding remain to be determined upon co-crystallization with these substrates.Fig. 4Electrostatic potential of ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase. Electrostatic potential ranges from -75 kiloteslas (red) to +42 kiloteslas (blue). The putative active site is positively charged and can attract negatively charged ATP molecules. SPOCK was used in the production of this figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Structural Homologues—A number of structural homologues of ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase were identified using DALI (with Z-scores ranging from 7.4 to 9.9). The list of homologues includes rubrerythrin (1RYT; Z-score 9.9, 2.0 Å r.m.s.d.), bacterioferritin (1BCF; Z-score 9.5, 2.9 Å r.m.s.d.), non-heme iron-containing ferritin (1QGH; Z-score 9.2, 2.4 Å r.m.s.d.), PexB (1DPS; Z-score 9.2, 2.3 Å r.m.s.d.), and ferritin (1EUM; Z-score 7.6, 2.6 Å r.m.s.d.). The homologues belong to the ferritin superfamily, whose members have a four-helix bundle core structure (18Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 40: 281-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All ferritin superfamily members exist as oligomers of 12 or 24 similar subunits comprising the four-helix bundle core structure (19Ilari A. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Tsernoglou D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In the case of the dodecamer oligomeric structures (1QGH and 1DPS), they are composed of trimers placed at the four corners of a tetrahedron. Four of the five helices of ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase overlap with those found in the subunits of the five ferritin superfamily proteins; however, the length of the helices as well as the topology differ. Although the structural alignments have high significance, we believe that the homology is not related to function. Although ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase also forms trimers, as do some of the ferritin oligomers, it does not contain any of the conserved iron-binding residues and, therefore, is unlikely to function as an iron-binding protein. Also, the location of the iron-binding site in the ferritin superfamily is almost always found in the interior of the four-helix bundle, whereas the putative active site of ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase is located on the exterior of the protein at the interface of two subunits.Structure Comparison with CobA—Based on amino acid sequence analysis, there are three families of cobalamin adenosyltransferases, namely the CobA-type, the PduO-type, and the EutT-type (2Dobson C.M. Way T. Lecher D. Nadir H. Nearing M. Lerner-Ellis J.P. Hudson T.J. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The recently determined crystal structure of CobA revealed a mixed α/β fold (17Bauer C.B. Fonseca M.V. Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Thompson T.B. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). By contrast, ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase contains a five-helix bundle. Thus, although CobA and ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase are both adenosyltransferases that generate AdoCbl, they have completely different structures. CobA and ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase also utilize different mechanisms for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. CobA belongs to the P-loop-containing family of nucleotide hydrolases (17Bauer C.B. Fonseca M.V. Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Thompson T.B. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas ATP: cobalamin adenosyltransferase is a PduO-type adenosyltransferase and, like PduO, has no recognizable P-loop for binding ATP. These differences in structure may contribute to the specificities of the adenosyltransferases for partic"

The abundance of Chk2 mRNA and protein has now been shown to be decreased by the induction of p53 in Saos2 cells. Ionizing radiation also triggered the phosphorylation and subsequent down-regulation of Chk2 in human colorectal HCT116 (p53+/+) cancer cells; irradiation of its isogenic mutant HCT116 (p53–/–) cells, which lack functional p53, induced Chk2 phosphorylation but not its down-regulation. In addition, HCT116 (p53+/+) cells constitutively expressing a dominant negative p53 (V143A) failed to suppress Chk2 expression after irradiation. Reporter gene assays in HCT116 (p53+/+) cells revealed that wild-type p53 repressed, whereas a dominant negative p53 mutant increased, the activity of the human Chk2 gene promoter. Mutational analysis showed that a CCAAT box located between nucleotides –152 and –138 of the promoter was responsible for its negative regulation by p53. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the transcription factor NF-Y binds to this CCAAT sequence. A dominant negative mutant of NF-YA abolished the effect of p53 on Chk2 promoter activity. These results suggest that p53 negatively regulates Chk2 gene transcription through modulation of NF-Y function and that this regulation may be important for reentry of cells into the cell cycle after DNA damage is repaired.

IntroductionThe fidelity of chromosome segregation is achieved by check-point controls that prevent cell cycle progression when damage to DNA is detected (1Elledge S.J.

Cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage in mammals is mediated predominantly through the transcriptional activation of specific genes by the tumor suppressor protein p53 (3el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). In addition, p53 functions as a negative regulator of various genes, although the promoters of most of these genes do not contain a typical consensus binding site for this protein (11Ginsberg D. Mechta F. Yaniv M. Oren M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9979-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which p53 exerts this inhibition is thought to involve physical interaction either with basal components of the transcription machinery (12Mack D.H. Vartikar J. Pipas J.M. Laimins L.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 13Seto E. Usheva A. Zambetti G.P. Momand J. Horikoshi N. Weinmann R. Levine A.J. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29677-29682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), but its molecular basis has remained unclear.Both the abundance and transactivation activity of p53 are regulated primarily by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, SUMO conjugation, and ubiquitylation (16Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar, 17Gostissa M. Hengstermann A. Fogal V. Sandy P. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Del Sal G.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of p53 at several sites within its transactivation domain is thus rapidly induced on exposure of human cells to genotoxic stresses such as ionizing radiation (19Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Both the kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM- and Rad3-related phosphorylate human p53 on Ser15, and this reaction appears to stabilize p53 by inhibiting its interaction with Hdm2 (the human ortholog of mouse Mdm2) (20Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar, 21Canman C.E.

If DNA damage is too severe for repair, p53 is phosphorylated on Ser46 by homeodomein-interacting protein kinase 2, resulting in specific activation of the gene for p53AIP1 and subsequent apoptosis (8Oda K.

Thus, although the consequences of p53 phosphorylation on specific residues are not fully characterized, such modifications probably not only regulate the transactivation activity of p53 but also determine the target gene specificity of this activity.The kinase Chk2, the mammalian ortholog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad53 (22Allen J.B.

Nature. 1995; 374: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), is implicated in the DNA damage checkpoint operative at the G2 phase of the cell cycle (25Blasina A. de Weyer I.V. Laus M.C.

Chk2 is thus rapidly activated as a result of its phosphorylation by ATM in response to the induction of DNA double strand breaks by ionizing radiation, and the activated enzyme is able to phosphorylate Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C in vitro (25Blasina A. de Weyer I.V.

Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). In addition, a potential role for Chk2 in the G1 cell cycle checkpoint has been suggested by the observation that overexpression of Chk2 induced G1 arrest in immortalized or transformed cells (31Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chk2 phosphorylates human p53 at multiple sites, including Ser20, in vitro (31Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of Ser20 does not inhibit the interaction of human p53 with Hdm2 in vitro, and substitution of the equivalent residue (Ser23) of murine p53 with Ala failed to prevent the accumulation or activation of p53 in embryonic stem cells in response to ionizing radiation (33Wu Z. Earle J. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of phosphorylation of human p53 on Ser20 has therefore remained unclear.Recent observations with Chk2 knockout (Chk2–/–) mice have implicated Chk2 in p53-dependent apoptosis (34Hirao A. Cheung A. Duncan G. Girard P.M. Elia A.J. Wakeham A. Okada H. Sarkissian T. Wong J.A. Sakai T. De Stanchina E. Bristow R.G. Suda T. Lowe S.W. Jeggo P.A. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Mol. Cell.

Both cell cycle arrest at G1 and p53-dependent transcriptional activation in response to ionizing radiation are impaired in embryonic fibroblasts from Chk2–/– mice. These observations thus suggested that Chk2 is an upstream regulator of p53 function. Furthermore, the abundance of Chk2 mRNA was shown to be inversely related to p53 status both in cell lines (27Tominaga K. Morisaki H. Kaneko Y. Fujimoto A. Tanaka T. Ohtsubo M. Hirai M. Okayama H. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31463-31467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and in specimens of human gastric cancer (37Shigeishi H. Yokozaki H. Oue N. Kuniyasu H. Kondo T. Ishikawa T. Yasui W. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 99: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that Chk2 is also a downstream target of p53. We have now investigated the regulatory interaction between Chk2 and p53. We show here that p53 negatively regulates Chk2 expression at the level of Chk2 gene transcription and that the transcription factor NF-Y appears to play an important role in this regulation.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Saos2, A172, and HeLa cells were cultured as described (38Nakanishi M. Adami G.R. Robetorye R.S. Noda A. Venable S.F. Dimitrov D. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HCT116 (p53+/+) and its isogenic mutant HCT116 (p53–/–) cells were cultured in McCoy's5A medium modified (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. The induction of p53 expression in Tet-on Saos2 cells was performed by the addition of doxycyclin (2 μg/ml) to the culture medium (39Ryan K.M. Ernst M.K. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). HCT116 (p53+/+) cells expressing a dominant negative p53 (V143A) were generated by the transfection of pcDNA3p53(V143A) into HCT116 (p53+/+) cells and the subsequent clonal selection using the culture medium containing 4 mg/ml of G418.Northern and Immunoblot Analyses—For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was isolated from Saos2 cells with the use of Isogen (Nippon Gene). The RNA (15 μg) was denatured, fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. Chk2, p53, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP with the use of a random primer labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were then subjected to hybridization with the labeled cDNAs, and hybridization signals were detected by autoradiography.For immunoblot analysis, cells were lysed in ice-cold IP kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml)) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, phosphatase substrate (5 mg/ml)(Sigma)). After removal of cell debris, the lysates (30 μg of protein) were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10 or 15% gels, and the separated proteins were then transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking of nonspecific sites with 5% nonfat dried milk in phosphatebuffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Chk2 (27Tominaga K.

Immune complexes were detected with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences).Flow Cytometry—Cells were harvested by exposure to trypsin, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed with 70% ethanol at –20 °C. They were then stained for 30 min in the dark with phosphate-buffered saline containing propidium iodide (30 μg/ml) and RNase A (5 μg/ml) before analysis of DNA content with a FACScan flow cytometer and Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson).Cloning of the 5′-Flanking Region of Human CHK2—A 6.0-kb fragment of the 5′ regulatory region of the human Chk2 gene (CHK2) was generated by PCR from genomic DNA of HeLa cells. The PCR primers, 5′-ACTGAATATAGTCTAACGGAGAACCCTTGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGCGAAGCTCAGGAGACTCCGTTCGCACA-3′ (reverse), were designed on the basis of sequence information deposited in GenBank™ (accession number AL117330). The PCR product was subcloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), yielding pGEM-T Chk2 6.0, and was sequenced for verification.RNase Protection Assay—A 274-bp DNA fragment was generated by PCR with the primers 5′-CTAATGTTGCTGATTGGCTG-3′ (nucleotides –160 to –141) and 5′-ATATGACTCACCGCGTGAGC-3′ (nucleotides 95–114) and with pGEM-T Chk2 6.0 as the template and was then cloned into pGEM-T easy. The resulting vector was linearized with NcoI and an antisense RNA probe (370 bp) was synthesized by SP6 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP with the use of a MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). An RNase protection assay was performed with 10 μg of total RNA from U937 cells and an RPAIII kit (Ambion). The size of protected fragments was determined by electrophoresis and comparison with the electrophoretic mobilities of molecular size markers and a sequencing ladder obtained from the single-stranded circular DNA of bacteriophage M13mp18, which was supplied with the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY).Reporter Plasmids—A series of human CHK2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs was generated by PCR with pGEM-T Chk2 6.0 as a template, a common 3′ primer (AS-1) with an NheI site at its 5′-end (5′-GGGGCTAGCAGCAGCAGATGTGGCCGTCA-3′; nucleotides –24 to –43), and 5′ primers with a SacI site at their 5′-ends (5′-GGGGAGCTCGGGAAATCACCTTACAAGGT-3′, –2848 to –2829, S-1; 5′-GGGGAGCTCCTAATGTTGCTGATTGGCTG-3′, –160 to –141; or 5′-GGGGAGCTCCCCGGGTTCTAAGTTCCGCT-3′, –107 to –88). Mutagenesis in putative protein binding sites was performed by the overlapping extension PCR method with two common primers (S-1 and AS-1) and the primers 5′-TAACCAGACTAATGTTGCTGGGCAGCTGGGGAGTCGAGGGGGCGG-3′ and 5′-CCGCCCCCTCGACTCCCCAGCTGCCCAGCAACATTAGTCTGGTTA-3′ for the CCAAT mutant and 5′-ATTGGCTGGGGAGTCGAGGGATGTGGATCACCCGAGGGGAACCCG-3′ and 5′-CGGGTTCCCCTCGGGTGATCCACATCCCTCGACTCCCCAGCCAAT-3′ for the SP1 mutant. The amplified DNA fragments were purified by electrophoresis, digested with SacI and NheI, and subcloned into the SacI-NheI sites of pGL2 Basic (Promega). The resulting constructs were sequenced for verification.Transient Transfection and Reporter Assay—HCT116 cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 12-well plates and then transfected, with the use of the Trans IT Transfection Reagent (Mirus), with 0.1 μg of human CHK2 promoter-luciferase reporter construct, 0.3 μg of a β-galactosidase expression vector (pCMVβ-gal; an internal control for normalization of transfection efficiency), 0.6 μg of pcDNA3 encoding either wild-type human p53, a dominant negative mutant, or a phosphorylation site mutant thereof, and, where indicated, 3 μg of pNF-YA29, a dominant negative mutant of NF-YA. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were harvested in Reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities with the use of a Bright-Glo luciferase assay system and β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). All assays were performed at least three times in duplicate, and representative data are presented.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay Analysis—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described (15Yun J.

In brief, double-stranded oligonucleotides containing either wild-type or mutant CCAAT (nucleotides –158 to –134) or C/EBP 1The abbreviation used is: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein. (–177 to –153) motifs of the human CHK2 promoter region were synthesized in vitro. The sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows: wild-type CCAAT motif, 5′-AATGTTGCTGATTGGCTGGGGAGTC-3′; mutant CCAAT motif, 5′-AATGTTGCTGCAGCTCTGGGGAGTC-3′; and wild-type C/EBP motif, 5′-GAGAGCGTCTAACCAGACTAATGTT-3′. The wild-type CCAAT oligonucleotide was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts of HeLa cells were prepared as described (40Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar), and 5 μg of extract protein were incubated for 30 min on ice with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), in the absence or presence of an unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide, in a final volume of 25 μl of a solution containing 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 20 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. The labeled probe (∼25,000 cpm) was added to the mixture, which was then incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. For “supershift” analysis, 2 μg of antibodies specific for the A or B subunits of NF-Y (Rockland) or for C/EBPα,β,δ or C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were incubated with the DNA/protein mixtures.RESULTSNegative Regulation of Chk2 Expression by p53—We have previously shown that the abundance of Chk2 mRNA in cancer cells was inversely related to their p53 status (27Tominaga K. Morisaki H. Kaneko Y. Fujimoto A. Tanaka T. Ohtsubo M. Hirai M. Okayama H. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31463-31467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transformation of normal cells by SV40 or adenovirus E6 up-regulated the amount of Chk2 mRNA and reintroduction of wild-type p53 reversed this up-regulation (27Tominaga K. Morisaki H. Kaneko Y. Fujimoto A. Tanaka T. Ohtsubo M. Hirai M. Okayama H. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31463-31467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that wild-type p53 inhibits the expression of Chk2. We therefore investigated this possibility further with the use of Tet-on Saos2 cells in which the expression of p53 is inducible by doxycyclin. Cells were lysed at various times after incubation with doxycyclin, and the amounts of Chk2 and p53 mRNA and protein were determined by Northern blot and immunoblot analyses. As expected, the abundance of both p53 mRNA and p53 protein increased with time of exposure to doxycyclin, with this effect being apparent as early as 2 h and maximal at 48 h (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the abundance of both Chk2 mRNA and protein decreased with a time course similar to that apparent for up-regulation of p53 expression, with <10% of the original amounts remaining after 48 h. As controls, the amounts of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA and β-actin were not affected by doxycyclin treatment.The expression of Chk2 has been shown to be regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, peaking at G2-M phases and decreasing in G1 (27Tominaga K. Morisaki H. Kaneko Y. Fujimoto A. Tanaka T. Ohtsubo M. Hirai M. Okayama H. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31463-31467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It was thus possible that the increased expression of p53 triggered by doxycyclin resulted in down-regulation of Chk2 expression as a result of the induction of G1 arrest. To examine this possibility, we monitored cell cycle progression in the doxycyclin-treated cells by flow cytometry. The up-regulation of p53 expression did not arrest the cell cycle of Saos2 cells at G1 phase (Fig. 1B); it did, however, increase the size of the cell population with a DNA content of less than 2 n. The p53-induced down-regulation of Chk2 expression was thus not likely to be due to G1 arrest of the cell cycle by p53.p53-dependent Down-regulation of Chk2 by Genotoxic Stress—Given that various types of genotoxic stress induce the accumulation of p53 (5Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar), we next examined whether such stress also triggers down-regulation of Chk2. Both HCT116 (p53+/+) cells expressing wild-type p53 and its isogenic mutant HCT116 (p53–/–) cells lacking p53 were exposed to ionizing radiation, and the abundance of p53, Chk2, and α-tubulin was then determined by immunoblot analysis. As expected, the amount of p53 in HCT116 (p53+/+) cells was increased as early as 2 h after irradiation, presumably as a result of protein stabilization (Fig. 2A). Also consistent with previous observations, Chk2 was phosphorylated (as revealed by a shift in electrophoretic mobility) in both cell types within 1 h of irradiation, confirming that ionizing radiation induced the activation of ATM in these cells. However, whereas the amount of Chk2 decreased in a time-dependent manner in irradiated HCT116 (p53+/+) cells, it remained unchanged in irradiated HCT113 (p53–/–) cells. The reduction in Chk2 abundance in HCT116 (p53+/+) cells was first detected at 2 h, with <30% of the protein remaining at 8 h. Similar reduction of Chk2 expression was also observed in HCT116 (p53+/+) but not in HCT116 (p53–/–) cells after UV irradiation, although the reduction of Chk2 and the accumulation of p53 in HCT116 (p53+/+) cells occurred somewhat later when compared with x-ray irradiation. Agents that affect cell cycle progression, such as hydroxyurea and aphidicolin, failed to induce p53 accumulation or to reduce the amount of Chk2 in HCT116 (p53+/+) cells (data not shown). HCT116 (p53+/+) cells expressing a dominant negative mutant of p53 (V143A) failed to down-regulate Chk2 protein level after x-ray irradiation. These results thus indicated that the accumulation of p53 induced by genotoxic stress triggers the down-regulation of Chk2 in HCT116 (p53+/+) cells.Fig. 2Down-regulation of Chk2 by ionizing radiation in a p53-dependent manner. A, HCT116 (p53+/+) or its isogenic mutant (p53–/–) cells were subjected to X-irradiation (20 grays) or UV irradiation (200 J/m2) and harvested at the indicated times thereafter. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for Chk2, p53, or α-tubulin, as indicated. B, HCT116 (p53+/+) cells expressing a dominant negative mutant of p53 (V143A) were subjected to X-irradiation (20 grays) and harvested at the indicated times thereafter. Cell lysates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis as done in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Isolation and Characterization of the Human CHK2 Promoter Region—A full-length human Chk2 cDNA was used as a probe to screen a human genomic DNA library. 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis of the positive genomic clones resulted in the identification of a 5′-noncoding exon and the consequent localization of the translational initiation codon (ATG) in exon 2 of CHK2. We isolated a 6.0-kb fragment of the CHK2 promoter region by PCR with genomic DNA from HeLa cells and primers based on available sequence information. To identify the transcriptional initiation site of CHK2, we performed an RNase protection assay with total RNA isolated from U937 human leukemia cells. An antisense RNA probe was synthesized from a PCR product that was obtained by amplification of the 6-kb fragment of the CHK2 promoter with primers thought to span the transcriptional start site. A protected RNA fragment of 103 bp was detected after treatment with RNase (Fig. 3A), indicating that the transcriptional initiation site (designated position +1) is located 7151 bp upstream of the translation start site. To identify potential regulatory elements in the CHK2 promoter, we sequenced the region upstream of exon 1 (Fig. 3B). A typical TATA-related sequence was not apparent in the region immediately 5′ to the transcription start site. Computer analysis did, however, reveal consensus binding sites for several transcription factors, including SP1, CCAAT box, C/EBP, AP1, and E2F sites.Fig. 3Determination of the transcriptional initiation site of human CHK2.

The molecular chaperone cooperates with many co-chaperones and partner proteins to fulfill its task. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, several co-chaperones of Hsp90 interact with Hsp90 via a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. Here we show that one of these proteins, Cns1, binds both to Hsp90 and to the yeast Hsp70 protein Ssa1 with comparable affinities. This is reminiscent of Sti1, another TPR-containing co-chaperone. Unlike Sti1, Cns1 exhibits no influence on the ATPase of Hsp90. However, it activates the ATPase of Ssa1 up to 30-fold by accelerating the rate-limiting ATP hydrolysis step. This stimulating effect is mediated by the N-terminal TPR-containing part of Cns1, whereas the C-terminal part showed no effect. Competition experiments allow the conclusion that Hsp90 and Ssa1 compete for binding to the single TPR domain of Cns1. Taken together, Cns1 is a potent cochaperone of Ssa1. Our findings highlight the importance of the regulation of Hsp70 function in the context of the Hsp90 chaperone cycle.

In contrast to Hsp70, which is involved in a wide variety of functions including folding of nascent polypeptide chains (4Nicolet C.M. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell.

Some of these partner proteins exhibit chaperone function on their own, such as Cdc37 (11Kimura Y. Rutherford S.L. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Freeman B.C. Yue L. Morimoto R.I. Lindquist S.

Another partner protein, Sti1 (stress-inducible protein 1), inhibits the ATPase of yeast Hsp90 as a noncompetitive inhibitor (14Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Binding involves the TPR domains of Sti1/Hop. TPR domains consist of TPR motifs, which are degenerated sequences of 34 amino acids (14Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Multiple TPR motifs adopt a righthanded superhelix structure, which creates a groove with a relatively large surface area, which is suitable for proteinprotein interactions. In the case of Hsp90 and Hsp70/Ssa1, binding of their highly conserved C-terminal residues EEVD to TPR domains is based predominantly on a “carboxylate clamp,” which anchors the aspartate via electrostatic interactions to a conserved set of side chains inside this groove. The TPR domain of Cns1 (cyclophilin seven suppressor) can be expected to form this clamp, since the residues Lys87, Asn91, Asn126, Lys156, and Arg160 agree with the respective consensus sequence (22Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Several Hsp90 co-chaperones, including the prolyl isomerases Cpr6 and Cpr7, Ppt1 (protein phosphatase 1), and the protein Cns1 contain TPR motifs. Cns1 was discovered as a suppressor of a severe growth defect caused by a deletion of Cpr7 (23Dolinski K.J. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7344-7352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A physical interaction between Cns1 und Hsp90 was shown by immunoprecipitation (23Dolinski K.J. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7344-7352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cns1 is a protein of 385 amino acids, resulting in a molecular mass of 44.1 kDa (24Baur A. Schaaff-Gerstenschlager I. Boles E. Miosga T. Rose M. Zimmermann F.K. Yeast. 1994; 10: 131Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of Cns1 is still unknown. Sequence analysis indicates the presence of three TPR motifs in the N-terminal part of the protein (Fig. 1). Cns1 shares weak homology of 24% and 18% sequence identity with Sti1. Thus, Cns1 was assigned to be a homologue of Sti1 (23Dolinski K.J. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7344-7352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, regions of high homology to Sti1 can only be found in the TPR domain of Cns1. In contrast to other co-chaperones containing a TPR domain, Cns1 is essential in yeast (4Nicolet C.M. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3638-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 23Dolinski K.J. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Mol. Cell.

Overexpression of Sti1, or of other TPR-containing proteins cannot compensate for the lethality of ΔCns1 (23Dolinski K.J. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7344-7352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Duina A.A. Marsh J.A. Gaber R.F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 943-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, unlike Sti1, Cns1 expression is not up-regulated upon heat shock (23Dolinski K.J. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7344-7352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under different stress conditions, Cns1 even seems to be regulated in an opposite manner compared with Sti1 (30Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). Also, the expression levels of the two proteins seem to be completely different, since Sti1 was found to be expressed with 6.77 × 105 molecules/cell, whereas Cns1 is present at ∼670 copies/cell and is therefore among the most poorly expressed proteins in yeast (31Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3006) Google Scholar). Here we were interested in analyzing the function of Cns1 in the regulation of the Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones. We show that Cns1 binds both to Hsp90 and Ssa1. Cns1 does not influence the ATPase activity of Hsp90, but it is a strong activator of the Ssa1 ATPase. Cloning of Cns1, Cns1 Fragments, and Ssa1-SBD—Cns1 and fragments of Cns1 were cloned by PCR using the following primers: for Cns1, 5′-GATCGGATCCATGAGCTCCGTTAACGCAAATGG-3′ and 5′-GATCGGTACCCACACAGATCTTCTTTCTAAGGCTTTTTC-3′; for Cns1 N-204, 5′-GATCGGATCCATGAGCTCCGTTAACGCAAATGG-3′, and 5′-GATCGGTACCTTGTTCTTTTCTATCAATCACTGATAACATATTGC-3′; for Cns1 218-C, 5′-GATCGGATCCCAGGAACGTGAAAACAAGAAAATTATG-3′ and 5′-GATCGGTACCTCACACAGATCTTCTTTCTAAGGCTTTTTC-3′. Ssa1-SBD was cloned by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTCCAAGACTCAAGATCTATTGTT-3′ and 5′-GATCGGATCCTTAATCAACTTCTTCAACGGTTG-3′. The resulting PCR products were cleaved with BamHI and KpnI and, for Ssa1-SBD, with BamHI and NdeI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pQE30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or pET28 a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI), respectively. The plasmids encode an N-terminal His6 tag. The sequence integrity of the clones was verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—Cns1 constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli HB101 (pUBS) (32Bolivar F. Backman K. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 68: 245-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8. After a temperature shift to 25 °C, recombinant protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 6 h, cells were lysed using a cell disruption system (Constant Systems Ltd., Warwick, UK). Cell lysis was performed in 40 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 8.5, 400 mm KCl, 6 mm imidazole. Cns1 was purified in a three-step approach, beginning with a chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), which was preloaded with 100 mm NiSO4. After applying the cell lysate, the column was washed with 10 volumes of 40 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 8.5, 400 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole before elution was performed in a step gradient with buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. Further purification was carried out on a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences), on which the protein was loaded in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm glycine, 5 mm DTT and eluted with a gradient from 20 mm to 1 m KCl. As a final step, a Superdex 75 26/60 HiLoad (Amersham Biosciences) was run in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl. Cns1 was stored in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT at concentrations of 3-9 mg/ml at -80 °C. Ssa1-SBD was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) codon+ cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that were grown at 37 °Ctoan A600 of 0.8. After the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the recombinant protein was expressed for 4 h. The Ssa1-SBD was purified as described for Cns1. Ssa1-SBD was stored in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, at concentrations of 1.4 mg/ml at -80 °C. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ssa1 was expressed using the Pichia pastoris expression system and purified as described earlier (33Wegele H. Haslbeck M. Buchner J. J. Chromatogr. B. 2003; 786: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Sti1 was purified as described elsewhere (15Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Citrate synthase (CS) and Cpr6 were purified as described (34Haslbeck M. Schuster I. Grallert H. J. Chromatogr. B. 2003; 786: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 35Mayr C. Richter K. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34140-34146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Ydj1 and the constructs Hsp90-Δ16 and Hsp90-ΔMEEVD were purified as described previously (14Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10328-10333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 36Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To verify the identity of Cns1, mass spectrometry of a tryptic digest of Cns1 was performed in a Biflex III matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany). The results from electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Ettan LC-MS system; Amersham Biosciences) confirmed the calculated mass of Ssa1-SBD and of the Hsp90-ΔMEEVD and -Δ16 constructs. Circular Dichroism Measurements—Far UV CD spectra were recorded using a J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a peltier unit (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany). The measurements were performed in 40 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.5, at 20 °C. Far UV spectra were measured with protein concentrations of 300 μg/ml in quartz-cuvettes of 0.1 cm in a wavelength range of 195-260 nm. All spectra were recorded in 10 accumulations and are buffer-corrected. Temperature transitions were recorded at a wavelength of 220 nm from 20 to 80 °C with a heating rate of 30 °C/h. CD spectra analysis was performed with the programs CDNN (CD deconvolution based on neural networks), using a network trained with 33 spectra (37Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar), and k2d, trained with 100 spectra (38Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Determination of the Oligomeric State of Cns1 by SEC-HPLC—To define the quaternary structure of Cns1, SEC-HPLC was performed on a PU-1580 system (Jasco). A Superdex 75 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) was run at 25 °C with 0.5 ml/min, using 10 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. Protein fluorescence was detected using an FP-920 fluorescence detector (Jasco) with excitation at 280 nm and emission at 320 nm. The proteins used to generate a calibration curve were bovine serum albumin (67.0 kDa), ovalbumin (47.9 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25.0 kDa), and ribonuclease A (15.7 kDa) (Amersham Biosciences). The standard proteins eluted at 17.06, 18.77, 24.06, and 26.14 min, respectively. The apparent molecular mass of Cns1 was determined by logarithmic interpolation from the calibration curve. Citrate Synthase Aggregation Assay—CS (Roche Applied Science) was thermally denatured by incubation at 40 °C in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2. Below, this buffer will be referred to as “standard buffer.” Aggregation of CS was measured by following the absorbance at 360 nm in a Cary50 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian, Darmstadt, Germany) with a thermostated cell holder. The CS assay was performed according to Buchner et al. (39Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Insulin Aggregation Assay—The insulin aggregation assay was performed in standard buffer. Turbidity was monitored at 360 nm in a Cary50 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian). Insulin (50 mm) (Sigma) was preincubated at 25 °C with varying concentrations of Cns1. The aggregation reaction was started by the addition of DTT to a final concentration of 20 mm. The assay was performed according to Scheibel et al. (40Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Peptidyl-Prolyl cis/trans-Isomerase (PPIase) Assay: Refolding of RCM-T1—To measure the PPIase activity of Cns1, we assayed the refolding of a reduced and S-carboxymethylated S54G/P55N variant of RNase T1 (RCM-T1), as described previously (41Mucke M. Schmid F.X. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14608-14619Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). RCM-T1 was preincubated in an unfolded state in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and allowed to refold spontaneously upon transfer into 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 m NaCl. The S54G/P55N mutation renders the cis/trans-isomerization of the Tyr38-Pro39 peptide bond as the limiting factor in refolding. The addition of a PPIase accelerates this reaction. The assay was run with 0.7 μm RNase T1, at 15 °C in a Spex FluoroMax-2 fluorescence spectrometer (Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ) at an excitation of 268 nm and an emission of 320 nm. Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements—Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were carried out on a Biacore X™ Instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). For determination of binding constants, Ssa1, Ssa1-SBD, and Hsp90-Δ16 were covalently linked on the matrix of a CM5 chip via amine coupling according to the supplier's instructions. Measurements were performed using standard buffer at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at 30 °C. To determine the binding constant, we directly measured the increase in resonance units (RU), when different concentrations of Cns1 were injected. Data analysis for direct binding curves used the linear relationship between the resonance signal (RU) and the amount of protein (c) bound to the chip. RUmax is the maximum signal, at which all molecules on the chip are saturated with the analyte (Equation 1).RU=RUmax×cc+KD(Eq. 1) ATPase Activity (Regenerative System)—ATPase activities were measured using a regenerative ATPase assay as described previously (42Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In short, the decrease in NADH concentration was detected by the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm, using a Cary50 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian). Assays were performed at 30 °C in standard buffer with 2 mm ATP added. Proteins were preincubated for 5 min at 30 °C. Typical protein concentrations were 2 μm for Hsp90, 5 μm for Ssa1, and up to 30 μm for the additional proteins. For full inactivation of the ATPase of Hsp90-ΔMEEVD, radicicol (Sigma) was used in a molar ratio of 2:1 to Hsp90-ΔMEEVD. Each protein was tested for contaminating ATPase activities. Data analysis was performed using Equation 2.kcat=kcat(max)×cc+KM(Eq. 2) ATPase Activity (Radioactive Assay)—ATPase assays were performed according to Kornberg et al. (43Kornberg A. Scott J.F. Bertsch L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3298-3304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were incubated in standard buffer at 30 °C. The ATPase reaction was initiated by the addition of the respective ATP concentrations including [α-32P]ATP (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany). A sample contained 0.1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP. As a control for unspecific protein effects, Cns1 was added after incubation at 70 °C for 30 min. For steady state hydrolysis measurements, a final ATP concentration of 2 mm was used. In the case of single turnover experiments, the ATP/protein ratio was kept constant at 0.8:1. After thin layer chromatography, the ATP/ADP ratio was quantified with a Typhoon 9200 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Hydrolysis rates were corrected for uncatalyzed, spontaneous ATP hydrolysis. Structure and Stability of Cns1—The hydropathy plot (44Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17272) Google Scholar) of Cns1 suggested two major structural units (Fig. 1). The first potential domain ranges from the N terminus to approximately amino acid 200, and the second is approximately between amino acid 215 and the C-terminal end of the protein. The respective constructs for each domain were produced with a view to analyze their contribution to the function of Cns1. Cns1 and Cns1 constructs were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. CD spectroscopy confirmed that Cns1 and the respective constructs are folded proteins, with a high α helix content in the full-length protein (Fig. 2A and Table I) and the N-terminal construct (data not shown). CD data analysis performed with the CD deconvolution program CDNN (37Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) or k2d (38Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) resulted in 38.6 or 43% α-helix and 26.4 or 23% β-structure content, respectively (Table I).Table ISecondary structure elements of Cns1 Data analysis of CD signals was carried out using the programs CDNN (37Bohm G.

Cns1 eluted at a elution time corresponding to a monomer (Fig. 2B). The fragments of Cns1 were also monomeric (data not shown). To analyze the functional integrity of Cns1 under assay conditions, we determined the stability of Cns1 against thermal unfolding. We observed a slight decrease in the far UV CD signal intensity at temperatures above 38 °C, followed by a defined transition in the range of 40 to 45 °C. The melting point (Tm) was determined to be at 42.8 ± 0.1 °C. Due to aggregation of Cns1 at high temperatures, the transitions were not reversible (data not shown). Chaperone/PPIase Activity of Cns1—Since several co-chaperones of Hsp90 exhibit chaperone activity on their own (11Kimura Y. Rutherford S.L. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Freeman B.C. Yue L. Morimoto R.I. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 12Bose S. Weikl T. Bugl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 13Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1996; 274: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), we were interested whether Cns1 has positive effects on the denaturation and aggregation of model substrate proteins. To test the influence of Cns1 on the thermal denaturation of a protein, we used the CS aggregation assay (39Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Here, even at a 10-fold molecular excess over CS, no effect of Cns1 was detectable (data not shown). The influence of Cns1 on chemical denaturation of a protein was assayed with insulin, which, upon reduction of its interchain disulfide bonds by DTT, is prone to aggregation (45Sanger F. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 45: 563-574Google Scholar). Cns1 was not able to prevent or delay insulin aggregation at any of the conditions tested (data not shown). For Cpr6 and Cpr7, PPIase activity has been demonstrated previously (26Warth R. Briand P.A. Picard D. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 35Mayr C. Richter K. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34140-34146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 46Duina A.A. Kalton H.M. Gaber R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18974-18978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Since Cns1 is a suppressor of the cellular defects observed upon deletion of the TPR-containing peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Cpr7, the formal possibility existed that Cns1 also may exhibit prolyl isomerase activity. Using the well established RNase T1 assay (47Scholz C. Stoller G. Zarnt T. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we could confirm that Cpr6 and Cpr7 clearly accelerated the refolding of the T1 RNase. Cns1, however, had no influence on the reaction under all conditions tested and therefore cannot be considered as a PPI-ase (data not shown). Cns1 Binds to Hsp90 —The presence of a TPR domain suggested that Cns1 may bind to the C-terminal end of Hsp90. To obtain quantitative data on the interaction between Cns1 and Hsp90-Δ16, SPR spectroscopy was applied. The analysis of sensorgrams of the binding of Cns1 at different concentrations to immobilized Hsp90-Δ16 allowed us to determine the dissociation constant of the Cns1-Hsp90 interaction to be 5.1 ± 0.4 μm (Fig. 3A). The TPR-containing fragment Cns1-N204 was also able to bind to Hsp90-Δ16 with comparable affinity of 5.3 ± 0.8 μm (data not shown). Binding of Cns1 to Hsp90-Δ16 required the TPR domain, since there was no detectable interaction between Hsp90-Δ16 and the C-terminal domain of Cns1, Cns1-218C (data not shown). In a different approach, using the C-terminally truncated Hsp90-ΔMEEVD construct immobilized on the SPR chip, we could not detect binding of Cns1 or its fragments Cns1-N204 and Cns1-218C (data not shown). In another approach, when Hsp90-ΔMEEVD was added to Cns1 prior to the injection on a Hsp90-Δ16 coated SPR sensor chip, it was not able to decrease the binding signal of Cns1 (Table III). A decrease would be expected for a protein that is able to bind to Cns1. The lack of the C-terminal residues of the Hsp90-ΔMEEVD construct abolishes the binding to Cns1. This demonstrates that the TPR domain of Cns1 interacts with the C-terminal end of Hsp90-Δ16.Table IIIAnalysis of the competition between Ssa1 and Hsp90 for binding to Cns1 The relative influences of Ssa1-SBD, Hsp90-Δ16, and Hsp90-ΔMEEVD as competitors for Cns1 binding were determined by assays with the Ssa1 ATPase or by SPR binding assays, as described. The stimulation/binding of Cns1 alone was set as 100%. The indicated proteins were added in a 10-fold excess (40 μm) over Cns1 (4 μm).

https://openalex.org/W2104181407,"Metabolism of glucocorticoids to A-ring-reduced dihydro- and tetrahydro-derivatives by means of hepatic 5α- and 5β-reductases has long been regarded as a pathway of irreversible inactivation. However, 5α-reduced metabolites of other steroids, e.g. testosterone and aldosterone, have significant biological activity. We investigated whether 5α-reduced metabolites of corticosterone are glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonists. Corticosterone, 5α-tetrahydrocorticosterone (5αTHB), and 5α-dihydrocorticosterone (5αDHB) were similarly effective in displacing tritiated dexamethasone from binding sites in hepatocytes, whereas 5β-reduced metabolites were less effective in binding. 5αTHB had glucocorticoid receptor agonist effects in vitro and in vivo. After transient co-transfection of hGR and a murine mammary tumor virus-luciferase reporter into HeLa cells, 5αTHB was active to a comparable extent as corticosterone (28-fold versus 37-fold induction, respectively, at 1 μm) and additive to the effect of corticosterone. 5β-Reduced metabolites did not activate GR. In H4IIE hepatoma cells, both 5αTHB and corticosterone induced mRNA expression of tyrosine aminotransferase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (6.0-versus 10.1-fold and 3.5-versus 3.9-fold at 1 μm, respectively), an effect that was inhibited by RU486. To assess in vivo glucocorticoid activity, suppression of plasma ACTH was demonstrated in adrenalectomized rats after intraperitoneal administration of vehicle (ACTH trough 80.2 pm), corticosterone (5 mg/kg; 22 pm, p < 0.001) or 5αTHB (5 mg/kg; 51.3 pm, p < 0.005). Similar endogenous concentrations of corticosterone and 5αTHB were detected in rat liver homogenates by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. We conclude that 5α-reduced glucocorticoids bind to and activate GR. Transcription of glucocorticoid-regulated genes in tissues that express 5α-reductases will thus be influenced by intracellular levels of both corticosterone and its 5α-reduced metabolites. Metabolism of glucocorticoids to A-ring-reduced dihydro- and tetrahydro-derivatives by means of hepatic 5α- and 5β-reductases has long been regarded as a pathway of irreversible inactivation.

We conclude that 5α-reduced glucocorticoids bind to and activate GR. Transcription of glucocorticoid-regulated genes in tissues that express 5α-reductases will thus be influenced by intracellular levels of both corticosterone and its 5α-reduced metabolites. The rate-limiting step in glucocorticoid metabolism is the reduction of the Δ4.5 double bond in the A-ring of the steroid structure. This reaction is catalyzed by either 5α- or 5β-reductase. The resulting dihydro-metabolites are then reduced further by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases to form tetrahydrometabolites (Fig. 1). Two genes encoding 5α-reductase type 1 and type 2 isozymes have been identified (1Normington K. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19548-19554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5α-Reductase type 1 predominates in androgen-independent tissues such as the skin, liver, and adipose tissue, whereas 5α-reductase type 2 is the predominant isozyme in reproductive tissues (2Andersson S.

However, 5α-reduced metabolites of other steroids may be potent agonists at the same receptor as their parent hormone. 5α-Reductases catalyze the conversion of testosterone to the more potent androgen receptor agonist dihydrotestosterone (4Siiteri P.K. Wilson J.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1974; 38: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Both 5α-dihydroaldosterone and 3α,5α-tetrahydroaldosterone possess mineralocorticoid activity in rat kidney (5Kenyon C.J. Saccoccio N.A. Harnik M. Morris D.J. Mantero F. The Adrenal Gland and Hypertension. Raven Press, New York1985: 209-214Google Scholar). The progesterone metabolites, 5α-dihydroprogesterone and allopregnanolone may act as neurosteroids, and allopregnanolone binds to the non-nuclear γ-aminobutyric acid, type A receptor (6Rapkin A. Morgan M. Goldman L. Brann D. Simone D. Matiesh V. J. Steroid Biochem. 1997; 90: 709-714Google Scholar). An early study by Carlstedt-Duke et al. (3Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson S.A. Gustafsson J.-A. Wrange O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 73: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) concluded that 5α-dihydrocorticosterone was practically devoid of glucocorticoid activity and competed for dexamethasone binding sites much less efficiently than corticosterone. However, Baxter and Tomkins (7Baxter J.D. Tomkins G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 932-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) found in rat hepatoma cells that 5α-dihydrocortisol induced tyrosine aminotransferase to a third of the level induced by cortisol. 5α-Reduced glucocorticoids may also regulate the gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and fructose-1,6-diphosphatase in rat liver (8Golf S.W.

However, no information is available on the activity of tetrahydro-metabolites at glucocorticoid receptors (GR) 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptors; 5αTHB, 5α-tetrahydrocorticosterone; 5αDHB, 5α-dihydrocorticosterone; 5βDHB, 5β-dihydrocorticosterone; 5βTHB, 5β-tetrahydrocorticosterone; TAT, tyrosine aminotransferase; GCMS, gas chromatography mass spectrometry; MMTV, murine mammary tumor virus; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; LAGS, low affinity glucocorticoid binding sites; GRE, glucocorticoid response element.. In the present study, we have determined the binding affinities of the A-ring-reduced metabolites of corticosterone for GR and studied the activation of GR by these metabolites in vitro and in vivo. Glucocorticoid Binding in Rat Hepatocytes—Male lean Zucker rats (6–8 weeks old, Harlan Olac Ltd, Bicester, UK; n = 6 per group) were anesthetized with sagatal (0.3 ml), the portal veins were cannulated, and livers were perfused in situ at a flow rate of 25 ml/min with a calcium-free buffer followed by a solution of collagenase type IV (Sigma) in Krebs buffer (10Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar). After tissue dissociation, hepatocytes were isolated by filtration through a nylon mesh (aperture = 0.125 mm). Hepatocytes were separated from dead cells by repeated low speed centrifugation (500 × g, 2 min), resuspended in hepatocyte incubation buffer (120 mm Krebs buffer with NaCl, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm lactate, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, and bovine serum albumin (2 g/100 ml buffer)) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion under a light microscope. For competitive binding experiments, duplicate incubations of hepatocytes (2 × 106/ml) were carried out at 4 °C overnight with [3H]4-dexamethasone (1.5 nm final concentration in molybdate buffer (25 μl, 0.1 m, pH 7.2) and non-radioactive competitor steroid (Steraloids, Newport, RI) dissolved in molybdate buffer (25 μl, final concentration from 0.63 nm to 200 μm). The competitors were dexamethasone, corticosterone, 5α-tetrahydrocorticosterone (5αTHB), 5α-dihydrocorticosterone (5αDHB), 5β-dihydrocorticosterone (5βDHB), and 5β-tetrahydrocorticosterone (5βTHB). Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration on filtermats pre-soaked in polyethylenimine (0.3%) using a Combi Cell Harvester (Skatron Instruments) with ice-cold H2O. Filters were dried and then encapsulated with Meltilex (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and counted in a 1450 Microbeta Plus Liquid Scintillation Counter (Wallac). Results were expressed as percentage of tritiated dexamethasone bound in the absence of competitor. Glucocorticoid Receptor Activation in Cell Lines—Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal-calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 200 mm l-glutamine and grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transient transfections were carried out using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. HeLa cells were seeded at 3 × 105/60-mm plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After overnight incubation, medium was replaced and cells were transfected with a total of 10 μg of DNA comprising 1 μg pCH110 (Pharmacia, St. Albans, UK; internal control), 5 μg pLTR-Luc (11Lefebvre P. Berard D.S. Cordingley M.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), 1 μg pRShGRα (11Lefebvre P. Berard D.S. Cordingley M.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and pGEM-3 (Promega, Southampton, UK). After overnight incubation, medium was replaced and steroid was added for 16 h before harvesting and lysis of cells. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured in cell lysates as described previously (12Voice M.W. Seckl J.R. Edwards C.R.W. Chapman K.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed using a Tropix Galacto Light Plus kit. All transfections were carried out in triplicate and the mean ratio of luciferase/β-galactosidase activities was calculated. Induction of tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) mRNA were assessed in H4IIE cells treated overnight with corticosterone, 5αTHB (1 μm in ethanol at <0.1% final volume) or vehicle and/or RU486 (1 μm; a GR antagonist). Total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and Northern analysis was carried out by using 32P-labeled TAT (13Ruppert S. Boshart M. Bosch F.X. Schmid W. Fournier R.E. Schutz G. Cell. 1990; 61: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), PEPCK (14Nyirenda M.J. Lindsay R.S. Kenyon C.J. Burchell A. Seckl J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2174-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), and U1 cDNA probes (15Manser T. Gesteland R.F. Cell. 1982; 29: 257-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Hybridized probe was quantified by using a Fuji FLA2000 PhosphorImager analyzer. Metabolic Transformation of Steroids—Medium was retained at –20 °C from all cell culture experiments. Steroids in medium were recovered by solid-phase extraction. Sep-pak C18 cartridges (Waters, Herts, UK) were activated using methanol (5 ml) followed by water (5 ml). Medium was loaded on to the column, and the eluant was discarded. The column was washed with water (5 ml) and steroids were eluted in methanol (2 ml). The eluant was dried under oxygen-free nitrogen at 60 °C and resuspended in ethyl acetate (2 ml) and water (200 μl). The organic layer was separated and dried before derivatization to form methoxime-trimethylsilyl derivatives as described (16Livingstone D.E.W. Jones G.C. Smith K. Andrew R. Kenyon C.J. Walker B.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Gas chromatographic mass spectrometric analysis was performed in electron impact mode (70 eV) using a Polaris Q ion-trap gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GCMS; Thermofinnigan, UK) (17Best R. Walker B.R. Clin. Endocrinol. 1997; 47: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The identities of steroids were confirmed by using analytical standards obtained from Steraloids. The level of detection for steroids was <1 nm. All solvents were high pressure liquid chromatography glass distilled grade (Rathburn, Walkerburn, UK), and reagents were obtained from Sigma (Poole, UK). In Vivo Glucocorticoid Activity and Suppression of ACTH—Adult lean male Zucker rats (6–8 weeks old, Harlan Olac Ltd, n = 6 per group) were fed ad libitum and maintained on a 12-h dark/light cycle. Rats were bilaterally adrenalectomized under halothane anesthesia and given 0.9% saline drinking water for 1 week before steroid treatment. Corticosterone, 5αTHB (both 5 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle (saline with 10% ethanol and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide) were injected intraperitoneally at 0900 h. Blood samples were taken at 0, 60, and 120 min after injection, and plasma was stored at –80 °C. Plasma ACTH concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay (Eurodiagnostica, Arnhem, The Netherlands). The inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation were < 4%. Plasma corticosterone levels were measured using an in-house radioimmunoassay (18Al-Dujaili E.A.S. Williams B.C. Edwards C.R.W. Steroids. 1981; 37: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation were <10%. Tissue Concentrations of Steroids—Livers (∼500 mg) from adult lean male Zucker rats (6–8 weeks old, n = 3) were homogenized in ice-cold potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7, 5 vol, 0.05 m) containing epi-tetrahydrocorticosterone and epi-corticosterone (250 ng) (Steraloids). The homogenate was dripped slowly into pre-chilled ethanol (95%) containing glacial acetic acid (3% v/v). The sample was stored overnight at –80 °C, allowed to return to 4 °C, and sonicated chilled (1–2 min). The sample was left on ice for 20–30 min and centrifuged (20,000 × g, 20 mins, 4 °C). The supernatant was reduced to dryness under a stream of nitrogen at 60 °C, and the dried residue was dissolved in methanol (0.5 ml, 80% v/v), sonicated (1 min), and additional water (0.5 ml) was added. This solution was passed through an activated Sep-pak column (C18, Waters). The steroids were eluted from the column in methanol (2 ml) after washes with water and methanol (40% v/v). The solvent was removed under a stream of nitrogen. Conjugates were hydrolyzed, and the resulting steroids were derivatized and analyzed by GCMS as described above and previously (17Best R. Walker B.R. Clin. Endocrinol. 1997; 47: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Calibration and blank standards were prepared concomitantly in the absence of tissue. Statistics—All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by least squares difference (Fisher's LSD) post hoc tests. 5α-Reduced Metabolites Bind to GR—Corticosterone and its 5α-reduced metabolites, 5αDHB and 5αTHB displaced dexamethasone in rat hepatocytes, with Kd in the nm range (Fig. 2; Table I). In contrast, 5β-reduced metabolites displaced dexamethasone to a minimal degree, having Kd values in the μm range.Table IBinding affinities of glucocorticoids in isolated hepatocytesSteroidKd nmp vs BDexamethasone38 ± 8<0.002Corticosterone153 ± 795αTHB268 ± 780.335αDHB336 ± 1420.025βTHB4484 ± 1313<0.0015βDHB9656 ± 3230<0.001 Open table in a new tab 5αTHB Activates GR in a Transient Transfection Assay— HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with an expression plasmid encoding human GR and LTR-luciferin (in which luciferin expression is driven by the glucocorticoid-responsive murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter). Both corticosterone and 5α-reduced corticosterone metabolites stimulated luciferase activity (Fig. 3A) was dependent upon co-transfection of glucocorticoid receptor. To test whether 5αTHB was a full or partial agonist at GR, 5αTHB was added to the incubation medium together with corticosterone. The effects upon luciferase activity were additive (Fig. 3B), suggesting that 5αTHB is a full agonist. It was not possible to measure maximal activation because high concentrations (>2 μm) of corticosterone and 5αTHB caused cell death. To eliminate the possibility that 5αTHB exerts its effects through conversion to corticosterone, the medium from cell experiments was analyzed by GCMS. Corticosterone was not detected in the medium from HeLa cells to which 5αTHB had been added and likewise 5αTHB was not detected in the medium to which corticosterone had been added (data not shown). 5αTHB Increases TAT and PEPCK mRNA in H4IIE Cells— The experiments above relied upon GR added exogenously. To test whether 5αTHB could activate endogenous GR, the ability of 5αTHB to increase TAT and PEPCK mRNA expression was assessed in the glucocorticoid-responsive cell line, H4IIE. After 16 h of incubation with 5αTHB, TAT mRNA expression was induced, albeit to a lesser extent than by corticosterone (Fig. 4A). In the case of PEPCK, corticosterone and 5αTHB induced the transcription of mRNA of PEPCK to the same degree (Fig. 4B). Incubation of H4IIE cells with the GR antagonist RU486 had no effect alone and prevented induction of transcription of TAT and PEPCK mRNAs by 5αTHB. 5αTHB Has Glucocorticoid Effects in Vivo—To test whether 5αTHB is a GR agonist in vivo, ACTH suppression in response to a bolus of steroid was measured in adrenalectomized animals. Basal plasma ACTH levels were high, consistent with prior adrenalectomy. 1 h after steroid injection, plasma ACTH levels were suppressed in corticosterone-treated animals compared with vehicle-treated animals. Suppression of ACTH levels was also seen with 5α-THB, although the effect was smaller than that with corticosterone (Fig. 5A). Plasma corticosterone levels were increased significantly in the corticosterone-treated animals by 1 h post-injection and remained elevated at 2 h. In contrast, plasma corticosterone levels in vehicle and 5αTHB-treated animals remained low throughout the experiment (Fig. 5B). Endogenous Concentrations of 5α-Glucocorticoid Metabolites—Similar concentrations of corticosterone (range 0.42–0.53 nmol/g tissue) and 5α-THB (range 0.14–1.2 nmol/g tissue) were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in extracts from rat liver homogenates (Fig. 6). Our studies demonstrate that 5α-reduced glucocorticoids are present at significant concentrations in vivo and are able to compete with dexamethasone for its binding sites in hepatocytes with affinity similar to that of corticosterone. We have shown in two cell models that this binding is associated with increased transcription by GR. Further, 5αTHB has glucocorticoid activity in vivo, as judged by suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis. Binding sites for glucocorticoids other than the cytosolic GR exist in rat liver. Low affinity glucocorticoid binding sites (LAGS) have been demonstrated in the microsomal fraction (19Ambellan E. Swanson M. Davidson A. J. Steroid Biochem. 1981; 14: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and nuclear envelope (20Roszak A.W. Lefebvre Y.A. Howell G.M. Codding P.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 37: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the nature and function of LAGS is uncertain. Melville et al. (21Melville J. King A.E. Watson D.E. Kenyon C.J. Benediktsson R. J. Endocrinol. Supplement. 1998; 156: 286Google Scholar) have shown that LAGS have a preference for 5α-rather than 5β-reduced steroids. It is possible that LAGS contributes to total binding in hepatocytes presented here, so that observed Kd values may be higher than we would find using purified GR. In isolated hepatocytes, 5β-reduced metabolites of corticosterone show substantially less binding to GR than corticosterone or 5α-reduced glucocorticoids. The ability of 5α- but not 5β-reduced metabolites to bind to GR is probably due to differences in stereochemistry around the A/B ring junction. Previous studies of dexamethasone binding to cytosolic GR indicate that binding is sensitive to the configuration at the C5 position (20Roszak A.W. Lefebvre Y.A. Howell G.M. Codding P.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 37: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The A/B ring junction of the 5β stereoisomers is “cis” and therefore skewed relative to the plane through rings B, C, and D, whereas the 5α isozyme is “trans” and, hence, has a structure akin to corticosterone. Similar stereospecificity in favor of 5α- rather than 5β-metabolites has been observed for binding to the androgen receptor (22Lefebvre Y.A. Morante S.J. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To address whether 5αTHB was not only bound to but also activated GR, we investigated GR-dependent responses in cells. We have shown in two different cell lines that 5α-reduced glucocorticoids induced GR-dependent gene transcription. First, in a transient transfection system, luciferase expression was placed under control of the MMTV promoter linked to a glucocorticoid response element (GRE). To induce translation of luciferase, ligand-activated GR must dimerize and associate with the GRE. The results indicate that the 5α-reduced metabolites were able to induce transcriptionally a glucocorticoid-sensitive reporter and that this response was dependent completely upon co-transfected GR. The effects of 5αTHB upon GR activation in this system were additive with those of corticosterone, suggesting this metabolite is a full agonist. However, it was not possible to compare maximal activation of 5αTHB to that of corticosterone in this system, because cell viability was compromised at the higher concentrations of glucocorticoids that would have been necessary (>2 μm). In a second model, H4IIE cells, activation of endogenous GR was measured by induction of transcription of endogenous TAT and PEPCK mRNAs. Expression of TAT and PEPCK mRNAs are controlled by numerous factors, including an upstream positive GRE (23Grange T. Cappabianca L. Flavin M. Sassi H. Thomassin H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3028-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Scott D.K. Stromstedt P.-E. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Transcriptional up-regulation of both genes was observed in the presence of 5αTHB, and this was prevented by the addition of the GR antagonist, RU486. Finally, we showed that 5αTHB administration in vivo induced a classical negative feedback effect upon the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In suppressing ACTH, 5αTHB had a slower onset of effect than corticosterone. This could relate in part to different central nervous system availability of 5αTHB compared with corticosterone. Although 5αTHB is bound minimally to plasma proteins (25Murphy B.P. Engelberg W. Pattee C.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. 1963; 23: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), its access across the blood-brain barrier and its susceptibility to export from the central nervous system by multidrug resistance P-glycoproteins are unknown. Moreover, corticosterone acts through both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors. The MR contributes more to early “shut-off” after stress and may account for the rapid effect of corticosterone (26Ratka A. Sutanto W.S. Bloemers M. De Kloet E.R. Neuroendocrinology. 1989; 50: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). It is not known whether 5αTHB can bind to MR; however, 5αDHB has no mineralocorticoid activity (27Sekihara H. Island D.P. Liddle G.W. Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 1450-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Importantly, we found no evidence in any of our model systems of the effects of 5α-reduced corticosterone being dependent upon metabolism to corticosterone. Using GCMS analysis of cell culture medium, or radioimmunoassay of plasma, corticosterone was not detected after administration of 5αTHB. The concentrations of corticosterone and 5αTHB were similar in extracts of liver from lean rats, suggesting that sufficient 5α- reduced metabolites of corticosterone are present to influence physiological processes. The assay did not reveal the presence of 5β-reduced glucocorticoid metabolites, in keeping with data from urinary analyses reported previously, showing that the 5α-reduced glucocorticoids are the predominant A-ring-reduced metabolite in the Zucker rat (16Livingstone D.E.W. Jones G.C. Smith K. Andrew R. Kenyon C.J. Walker B.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This result is unlike that from human urine, where equivalent 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites of cortisol are detected. The implication of these findings is that, when present at physiological concentrations, 5α-reduced glucocorticoids contribute to GR activation. Potentially, this will occur wherever 5α-reductases are expressed, including glucocorticoid target tissues such as liver and adipose tissue. This provides another intracrine mechanism, over and above the influence of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (28Seckl J.R. Walker B.R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), whereby local concentrations of active glucocorticoids can be modulated independently of circulating corticosterone levels. These findings are of significant clinical importance because our group has demonstrated previously that 5α-reduction of glucocorticoids is increased (often at least 2-fold) in human obesity and in the Zucker rat model of obesity (16Livingstone D.E.W. Jones G.C. Smith K. Andrew R. Kenyon C.J. Walker B.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 29Andrew R. Phillips D.I.W. Walker B.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1806-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). 5α-Reduction of glucocorticoids is also increased in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (30Stewart P.M. Shackleton C.H.L. Beastall G.H. Edwards C.R.W. Lancet. 1990; 335: 431-433Abstract PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Whether 5α-reductases contribute to GR activation and the adverse metabolic phenotype in these subjects is now a priority for further investigation.

Laminin 5A, which consists of the three truncated chains α3A, β3, and γ2, is known to have strong activity to promote cell adhesion and migration, whereas a laminin 5 variant consisting of a full-sized α3 chain (α3Β) and the β3 and γ2 chains, laminin 5B, has not been characterized yet. In the present study, we for the first time cloned a full-length human laminin α3B cDNA and isolated the human laminin 5B protein. The molecular size of the mature α3B chain (335 kDa) was approximately twice as large as the mature α3A chain in laminin 5A. Laminin 5B had significantly higher cell adhesion and cell migration activities than laminin 5A. In addition, laminin 5B potently stimulated cell proliferation when added into the culture medium directly. Furthermore, we found that the α3B chain undergoes proteolytic cleavage releasing a 190-kDa NH2-terminal fragment. The 190-kDa fragment had activities to promote cellular adhesion, migration, and proliferation through its interaction with integrin α3β1. These activities of the NH2-terminal structure of the α3B chain seem to contribute to the prominent biological activities and the physiological functions of laminin 5B.

Laminins are an important family of extracellular matrix proteins, which are mainly localized in the basement membranes of various tissues and regulate various cellular functions including cell adhesion and migration (1Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Google Scholar, 2Aumailley M. Rousselle P. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 19-28Google Scholar). The different combinations of five α, three β, and three γ chains give rise to at least 15 laminin heterotrimers with the well known cross-shaped structure (1Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Google Scholar). Of the three laminin subunits, the α chain is most important in determining the tissue-specific distribution and specific biological activity of the laminin isoforms (3Miner J.H. Patton B.L. Lentz S.I. Gilbert D.J. Snider W.D. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 685-701Google Scholar). The laminin α chains are classified into two groups, “full-sized” (α1, α2, α3Β, and α5) and “truncated” (α3A and α4) (1Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of the full-sized α chains contains three globular domains (VI, IVb, and IVa) and three rodlike domains (V, IIIb, and IIIa) consisting of laminin type epidermal growth factor repeats. The laminin NH2-terminal domain VI, which is completely absent in the truncated α chains (α3A and α4), is thought to be essential for the self-assembly and co-polymerization of laminins into large noncovalent networks in the basement membranes and have several cell-binding sites (1Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Google Scholar). On the other hand, all α chains contain a globular (G) domain consisting of five laminin G modules (G1 to G5) at the COOH terminus. The COOH-terminal G domain of the α chains plays major roles in the interaction with cell surface receptors such as integrins, syndecans, and dystroglycan (4Timpl R. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Andac Z. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Google Scholar, 5Ekblom P. Lonai P. Talts J.F. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 35-47Google Scholar, 6Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Tsubota Y. Moriyama K.

The β3 and γ2 chains are found only in LN5, and all the three LN5 subunits are truncated in the short arms (NH2-terminal regions). Consistent with the unique structure, LN5 has unique biological activities. LN5 strongly promotes cellular scattering, adhesion, and migration of various types of cells compared with other laminins and extracellular matrix proteins (7Miyazaki K. Kikkawa Y. Nakamura A. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11767-11771Google Scholar, 8Kikkawa Y. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 862-869Google Scholar, 9Rousselle P. Aumailley M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 205-214Google Scholar). These activities are mediated by the interaction with integrin receptors, α3β1, α6β1, and α6β4 (10Carter W.G. Ryan M.C. Gahr P.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 599-610Google Scholar, 11Niessen C.M. Hogervorst F. Jaspars L.H. de Melker A.A. Delwel G.O. Hulsman E.H. Kuikman I. Sonnenberg A. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 360-367Google Scholar). In the skin, the association of LN5 with integrin α6β4 is critical to form the hemidesmosome structure, which supports the stable adhesion of basal keratinocytes to the underlying connective tissues (12Nievers M.G. Schaapveld R.Q. Sonnenberg A. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 5-17Google Scholar, 13Baker S.E. DiPasquale A.P. Stock E.L. Quaranta V. Fitchmun M. Jones J.C. Exp.

Therefore, functional defects of LN5 cause a lethal skin disease, Herlitz's junctional epidermolysis bullosa (15Ryan M.C. Lee K. Miyashita Y. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1309-1323Google Scholar, 16Pulkkinen L. Uitto J. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 29-42Google Scholar). On the other hand, the cell migration-promoting activity of LN5 is thought to contribute to wound healing (17Ryan M.C. Tizard R. VanDevanter D.R. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22779-22787Google Scholar, 18Goldfinger L.E. Hopkinson S.B. deHart G.W. Collawn S. Couchman J.R. Jones J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2615-2629Google Scholar) and tumor invasion (19Pyke C. Salo S. Ralfkiaer E. Romer J. Dano K. Tryggvason K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4132-4139Google Scholar). Cloning of the laminin α3 chain cDNA has revealed two distinct mRNA transcripts encoding the truncated, α3A chain (α3EpA) and the full-sized, α3B chain (α3EpB) (17Ryan M.C. Tizard R. VanDevanter D.R. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22779-22787Google Scholar, 20Galliano M.F. Aberdam D. Aguzzi A. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21820-21826Google Scholar). The expression of the two transcripts is regulated by alternative splicing and distinct promoters (21Ferrigno O. Virolle T. Galliano M.F. Chauvin N. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. Aberdam D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20502-20507Google Scholar). The complete sequence of the α3B chain has recently been deduced from the sequences of partial cDNA clones and genomic DNA clones in mice (3Miner J.H.

Whittock N.V. Coleman C.M. Mellerio J.E. Ashton G.S. Dopping-Hepenstal P.J. Eady R.A. Jamil T. Phillips R.J. Shabbir S.G. Haroon T.S. Khurshid K. Moore J.E. Page B. Darling J. Atherton D.J.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 65-70Google Scholar). However, neither complete cDNA clones for the α3B chain nor the α3B-containing laminins have been isolated so far. The α3B chain is expected to associate with the laminin β3 and γ2 chains and with the laminin β1/β2 and γ1 chains to produce laminin 5B (LN5B) and laminin 6B/7B, respectively, because the α3A and α3B chains share the common I/II domain, which is essential for the coiled-coil structure of the three subunits. LN5B consists of the full-sized α3 chain (α3B) and the truncated β3 and γ2 chains, and thereby it is expected to have a long rodlike structure. This type of laminin isoform is not known apart from LN5B. Because the laminin α3B chain is more widely and more intensively expressed than the α3A chain in mouse and human tissues (20Galliano M.F. Aberdam D. Aguzzi A. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21820-21826Google Scholar, 24Doliana R. Bellina I. Bucciotti F. Mongiat M. Perris R. Colombatti A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 65-70Google Scholar), LN5B seems to be a major LN5 isoform in adult tissues. In the present study, we cloned a human laminin α3B chain cDNA and for the first time isolated and characterized the human LN5B protein from HEK293 cells, which had been transfected with the cDNAs for the three LN5B subunits. The results demonstrate unique biological activities of this novel LN5 isoform and an NH2-terminal, proteolytic fragment of the α3B chain. To distinguish the two forms of LN5, we designate the well characterized LN5 consisting of the α3A, β3, and γ2 chains as LN5A in this report. Materials—Human laminin 10/11 was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Mouse EHS laminin 1, human laminin 2/4 (merosin), and human fibronectin were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Human recombinant LN5A was purified as described previously (25Kariya Y. Ishida K. Tsubota Y. Nakashima Y. Hirosaki T. Ogawa T. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 607-612Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the NH2-terminal regions of human laminin α3A chain (Lsαc3) and γ2 chain (D4B5) have been described previously (26Kariya Y. Tsubota Y. Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. Miyazaki K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 506-520Google Scholar, 27Mizushima H. Koshikawa N. Moriyama K. Takamura H. Nagashima Y. Hirahara F. Miyazaki K. Horm. Res. 1998; 50: 7-14Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody against the human laminin β3 chain (kalinin B1) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Function-blocking anti-integrin antibodies used are the anti-α2-integrin antibody (P1E6), the anti-α3-integrin antibody (P1B5), the anti-α5-integrin antibody (P1D6), and the anti-β1-integrin antibody (6S6) from Chemicon, and the anti-α6-integrin antibody (GoH3) from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Cells and Culture—The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 (ATCC CRL-1573) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Rockville, MD). The human bladder carcinoma cell line EJ-1 and the Buffalo rat liver-derived epithelial cell line BRL have been used in previous studies (26Kariya Y. Tsubota Y. Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. Miyazaki K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 506-520Google Scholar). A spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, was a generous gift from Dr. N. E. Fuseing (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany). These four cell types were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin, and streptomycin sulfate. The human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A (ATCC CRL-10317) was obtained from ATCC, and cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, 0.01 mg/ml insulin, 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone, and 5% horse serum. Expression Vector Constructions—The expression vectors of human laminin α3A, β3, and γ2 chains have been described previously (25Kariya Y. Ishida K. Tsubota Y. Nakashima Y. Hirosaki T. Ogawa T. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 607-612Google Scholar). A human laminin α3B chain cDNA was constructed as follows. Because approximately half of the α3B sequence is identical to the α3A sequence, we used the α3A cDNA LS/CX encoding the COOH-terminal sequence of the α3B chain (28Mizushima H. Miyagi Y. Kikkawa Y. Yamanaka N. Yasumitsu H. Misugi K. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1196-1202Google Scholar). The remaining α3B cDNA sequence was deduced from a previously reported partial sequence (GenBank™ accession no. AF005258) and the sequences of two genomic clones, RP11-609K12 and RP11-666022 (GenBank™ accession nos. AC067796 and AC090366, respectively). To obtain overlapping cDNA clones, a human lung 5′-Stretch Plus cDNA library (Clontech, CA) was screened and amplified by the ECL direct nucleic acid labeling/detection system and PCR with Ex Taq polymerase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan), respectively. A cDNA fragment of 300 bp in the 5′ region was synthesized as three oligonucleotides and amplified by PCR. All PCR-derived cDNA fragments were cloned into the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and their sequences were verified. All primers used for PCR are listed in Table I. The different cDNA fragments that overlap each other were ligated. The full-length laminin α3B cDNA consisted of 10,002 bp and had an open reading frame encoding 3,333 amino acids (GenBank™ accession no. AB107369). To prepare an expression vector, we constructed a truncated α3B cDNA of 8,832 bp that had an open reading frame encoding 2,944 amino acid residues without the COOH-terminal G4-G5 domain. This truncated α3B cDNA was inserted into the EcoRV sites of pcDNA3.1/Hygro (+) mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) in correct orientation and used as LNα3B#3 pcDNA3.1 Hygro (+).Table IPrimers used in this studyPlasmidTemplatePrimerPrimer sequence5′-(I)OligonucleotideMet + EcoRV5′-TTGATATCATGGCGGCGGCCGCGCGGCCTCGGGGTCGG-3′I-3′5′-GCGGCCCCGGGATCCCGAGCGGT-3′5′-(II)OligonucleotideII-5′5′-GATCCCGGGGCCGCGGCCGGGCTCAG-3′II-3′5′-AGTAGAGCTCGGGCTGGGGCCTC-3′5′-(III)OligonucleotideIII-5′5′-CCGAGCTCTACTGCAAGTTGGTCGGG-3′III-3′5′-TCCATCGATGGCATTGGTGACAGG-3′VI-7cDNA libraryVI-5′5′-GCGGATCCAGGAAAGCACATCCTGTCACC-3′VI-3′5′-GCGAATTCCTGTGTTGTGCTGACAGTTAATGC-3′VI/V-10cDNA libraryVI/V-5′-25′-TACTATGATCCAGATGTTGAGCG-3′VI/V-3′5′-AGTTGATGGTACCAGCTGGGTC-3′V/IVb-3cDNA libraryV/IVb-5′5′-AGGTTCCAGCAGTGCTTGTGACC-3′V/IVb-3′5′-GAACAGACCCGGAGCTCTTCAC-3′IVb/IIIb-8cDNA libraryIVb/IIIb-5′5′-GTTGATGTGAATGTGAAGAGCTCC-3′IVb/IIIb-3′5′-CCACAATTGGTGATAAACTCGAGTG-3′IIIb/IVa-7cDNA libraryIIIb/IVa-5′5′-CTATGACTACCAAATACTTCAC-3′IIIb/IVa-3′5′-CACATCTGCCAGTCTAGACAGC-3′ Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of LN5B—HEK293 cells were sequentially transfected with the expression vectors of the laminin γ2 chain and laminin β3 chain using the LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) as described previously (25Kariya Y. Ishida K. Tsubota Y. Nakashima Y. Hirosaki T. Ogawa T. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 607-612Google Scholar). A HEK293 clone highly expressing both β3 and γ2 chains, β3γ2-HEK, was finally transfected with the LNα3B#3 pcDNA3.1 Hygro (+), and stable transfectants were selected with 100 μg/ml hygromycin (Wako, Osaka). Three HEK293 cell clones highly expressing the three LN5B chains were selected, and clone 9 was used as LN5B-HEK unless otherwise indicated. For purification of LN5B, the serum-free conditioned media from β3γ2-HEK293 cells and LN5B-HEK293 cells were collected in roller bottles, which had been precoated with poly-l-lysine, and proteins were precipitated by 80% saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved in and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 0.005% (w/v) Brij35, and 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, and then applied to molecular sieve chromatography on a Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. Fractions containing LN5B were pooled and applied to a gelatin-Sepharose 4B column to remove fibronectin. LN5B in the unbound fractions from the gelatin column was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with the anti-laminin α3 monoclonal antibody LSαc3. Bound proteins were eluted from the affinity column with 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and immediately neutralized to pH 7.0 to 7.5 with a small volume of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The LN5B protein thus purified was stored in the presence of 0.005% Brij35 and 0.1% CHAPS. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Purification of 190-kDa NH2-terminal Fragment of Laminin α3B Chain—The serum-free conditioned medium from LN5B-HEK293 cells was fractionated by molecular-sieve chromatography on a Sepharose 4B column as described above. Fractions containing the 190-kDa, proteolytic fragment of laminin α3B chain were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.05 m NaCl, 0.005% (w/v) Brij35 and 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, and applied to a Q-Sepharose FF anion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a 0.05-0.5 m NaCl gradient. The 190-kDa fragment was eluted at 0.15-0.2 m NaCl, and the protein was further purified by molecular sieve chromatography on a Superdex 200 HPLC column (Amersham Biosciences). To avoid a possible contamination of the sample with LN5B, the purified 190-kDa fragment was passed through an immunoaffinity column with the anti-laminin γ2 monoclonal antibody D4B5. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Two hundred microliters of the cell suspension (2 × 105 cells/ml) in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS was inoculated per well of Lab-Tek 8-well chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL). After incubation for 2 days, the cells were washed with PBS (-) and then fixed in 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS (-) for 15 min. For permeabilization, the cells were treated with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS (-). The fixed cells were blocked with 1.2% BSA in PBS (-) for 1 h and then incubated with a primary antibody diluted in the BSA-containing buffer for 1 h. A fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used for detection. F-actin was stained using rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (BX50-FLA; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with 100 ×/1.35 UPlan-Apochromat oil immersion objectives. Cell Adhesion Assay—Cell adhesion assay was performed as described previously (26Kariya Y. Tsubota Y. Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. Miyazaki K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 506-520Google Scholar). Briefly, each well of 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) was coated with a substrate protein and then blocked with 1% BSA. Cells (2 × 104 cells) were inoculated per each well containing serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After nonadherent cells were removed, adherent cells were fixed and stained with Hoechst 33432. The fluorescent intensity of each well of the plates was measured using a CytoFluor 2350 fluorometer (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For inhibition assay, the cell suspension was incubated with function-blocking anti-integrin antibodies for 20 min at room temperature before inoculation. Assays of Cell Scattering and Migration—The cell-scattering and cell migration activities of LN5A and LN5B proteins were assayed as reported previously (26Kariya Y. Tsubota Y. Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. Miyazaki K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 506-520Google Scholar). BRL cells were suspended in DMEM/F-12 plus 1% FCS and inoculated into each well of 24-well plates at a density of 7 × 103 cells/well. Each test sample was directly added to the cultures and incubated at 37 °C for approximately 40 h. For the cell migration assay, EJ-1 cells (2.0 × 104 cells in DMEM/F-12 plus 1% FCS) were inoculated per well of 24-well plates precoated with a test protein. After the preincubation for 1.5 h at 37 °C, cell movement was monitored using a time-lapse video equipment for 8 h. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed on 5% gels or 4.0-7.5% gradient gels under reducing or nonreducing conditions. Separated proteins were stained with a Wako silver staining kit II (Wako, Osaka, Japan) or Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). For immunoblotting analyses, proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and detected by the ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of Amino Acid Sequence—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Nippon Genetics, Tokyo, Japan). The blotted membranes were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G, and the NH2-terminal protein sequences were determined using a 492 Procise protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Secretion of LN5B by β3γ2-HEK Cells—The laminin α3B chain has been reported to be expressed in HEK293 cells (24Doliana R. Bellina I. Bucciotti F. Mongiat M. Perris R. Colombatti A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 65-70Google Scholar). We detected none of the laminin α3B, β3, and γ2 chains in the culture medium of HEK293 cells by immunoblotting analysis (data not shown). However, when HEK293 cells were transfected with the cDNA expression vectors for the β3 and γ2 chains, the conditioned medium of the HEK293 transfectant (β3γ2-HEK) showed a weak cell-scattering activity toward BRL cells, suggesting that the heterotrimer of LN5 or LN5B was secreted to the culture medium (data not shown). We purified this cell-scattering factor from the serum-free conditioned medium of β3γ2-HEK cells by immunoaffinity chromatography with a monoclonal antibody against the laminin α3 chain. The purified protein had activities to promote cell adhesion, migration, and scattering (data not shown). SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions resolved the purified protein into four major bands at ∼630, 580, 435, and 385 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 2), of which the latter two bands were similar in size to the two LN5A forms (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Under reducing conditions, the purified protein was resolved into five major bands of 335, 150, 145, 135, and 105 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 4). These bands were reactive to one of the antibodies against the three LN5 subunits in immunoblotting analysis, and the three smaller protein bands were also found in LN5A (data not shown). Because the 335-kDa band was recognized by the anti-laminin α3 antibody, the purified protein was thought to be LN5B. However, the yield of LN5B was too low for further characterization. Cloning of Human Laminin α3B Chain cDNA—We previously established the LN5A-producing HEK293 cell line, LN5-HEK, which had been transfected with the laminin α3A, γ2, and β3 expression vectors (25Kariya Y. Ishida K. Tsubota Y. Nakashima Y. Hirosaki T. Ogawa T. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 607-612Google Scholar). To express recombinant LN5B in HEK293 cells, a cDNA encoding the human laminin α3B chain was cloned as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The deduced full-length cDNA sequence consisting of 10,002 base pairs had an open reading frame encoding 3,333 amino acids (GenBank™ accession no. AB107369) (Fig. 2). Like the other full-length α chains, the short arm of the human laminin α3B chain can be separated into six domains (VI, V, IVb, IIIb, IVa, and IIIa), and the total molecular size is larger than the α1 and α2 chains but smaller than the α5 chain. Because the LN5B secreted from β3γ2-HEK cells lacked the G4-G5 domain of the α3 chain as a result of the proteolytic processing as in the case of LN5A (29Tsubota Y. Mizushima H. Hirosaki T. Higashi S. Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 614-620Google Scholar), we constructed a truncated cDNA of 8,832 base pairs, which has an open reading frame encoding the α3B sequence (2,944 amino acid residues) without the G4-G5 domain (Fig. 2). This expression vector, named LNα3B#3 pcDNA3.1 Hygro (+), was used to express a recombinant LN5B in HEK293 cells. Establishment and Characterization of HEK293 Cells Overexpressing LN5B—To establish LN5B-producing HEK293 cells, HEK293 cells were sequentially transfected with the γ2, β3, and α3B expression vectors. Three stable clones (clones 2, 7, and 9), which were secreting the α3B, β3, and γ2 chains at high levels, were selected from the HEK293 transfectants, and clone 9 was used as LN5B-HEK cells. In monolayer cultures, the parent HEK293 cells and β3γ2-HEK cells, the latter of which had been transfected with the β3 and γ2 chain cDNAs and secreted a very low level of LN5B, exhibited compact morphology with tight cell-cell contact (Fig. 3A). In contrast, LN5B-HEK cells exhibited a flat and scattered morphology with prominent lamellipodia. These morphological characteristics were reproduced in the two other clones of LN5B-HEK cells (data not shown). However, morphological difference was not clear as compared between LN5B-HEK and LN5-HEK cell lines, the latter of which overexpresses LN5A (25Kariya Y. Ishida K. Tsubota Y. Nakashima Y. Hirosaki T. Ogawa T. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 607-612Google Scholar). These results suggest that the LN5B secreted by LN5B-HEK cells promotes adhesion and motility of the producing cells by an auto-crine mechanism. When the serum-free conditioned medium of LN5B-HEK cells was analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, the two major bands of 630 and 580 kDa and a trace of the 435- and 385-kDa bands were directly detected by the CBB staining in a high molecular mass region (Fig. 1B, lane 3). On reducing SDS-PAGE, the major protein bands found in the LN5B purified from β3γ2-HEK cells (Fig. 1A, lane 4) were all detected in the conditioned medium (Fig. 1B, lane 4). In addition, the conditioned medium contained a 190-kDa protein, which was not found in the purified LN5B. These results indicated that LN5B was a major secreted protein in LN5B-HEK cells. Deposition of the LN5 isoforms was compared between LN5B-HEK and LN5-HEK cell lines. When the extracellular matrix proteins deposited by LN5B-HEK cells were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE, the LN5B subunits found in the conditioned medium, but not the 190-kDa protein, were also detected as major bands by the CBB staining (Fig. 1B, lane 7). There was no apparent difference in the efficiency of the LN5B/5A deposition between LN5B-HEK and LN5-HEK cell lines. When LN5B and LN5A were subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, these proteins did not migrate from the top of the gel, suggesting that they formed large protein complexes in the matrix (data not shown). The deposition of LN5B and LN5A on the matrix was further analyzed by immunofluorescent microscopy using the anti-γ2 antibody (Fig. 3B). LN5B-HEK cells and LN5-HEK cells showed distinct distribution of the LN5 isoforms. LN5A was highly deposited at peripheral regions of cell bodies forming treelike patterns. LN5A was also deposited on cell-free spaces. In contrast, LN5B was deposited under cell bodies producing cloudlike high density spots, which were co-localized with the marginal actin accumulation. LN5B was scarcely deposited on cell-free spaces. We also found that expression of LN5B in HEK293 cells has a striking effect on the cell growth (Fig. 3C). Parent HEK293 cells very poorly grew in a standard culture medium containing 10% FCS, whereas LN5B-HEK cells rapidly grew in the same conditions. LN5-HEK cells also grew well but at a slightly lower rate than LN5B-HEK cells. The two other clones, 2 and 7 of LN5B-HEK cells, also showed high growth rates similar to that of clone 9 (Fig. 3D). Unexpectedly, the growth rate of β3γ2-HEK cells was comparable with that of LN5B-HEK cells (Fig. 3D), although the two cell types showed different morphology (Fig. 3A). These results suggested that the secreted LN5B and LN5A stimulated the proliferation of the producing cells. The LN5B production in β3γ2-HEK cells was estimated to be less than 1% of that in LN5B-HEK cells. Therefore, it is considered that a high LN5B production is required for the morphological change, but a very low level of LN5B is enough for the growth stimulation. Purification of Recombinant LN5B—To purify recombinant LN5B, the conditioned medium of LN5B-HEK was applied to molecular sieve chromatography and then to immunoaffinity chromatography with the anti-laminin α3 monoclonal antibody. The purified LN5B was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under both reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 4). The purified LN5B was separated into two major bands of 630 and 580 kDa and two minor bands of 435 and 385 kDa under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 4A, lane 1). The relative weight ratio of the 435/385-kDa LN5B"
https://openalex.org/W2123874820,"Gene 4 protein (gp4) of bacteriophage T7 provides two essential functions at the T7 replication fork, primase and helicase activities. Previous studies have shown that the single-stranded DNA-binding protein of T7, encoded by gene 2.5, interacts with gp4 and modulates its multiple functions. To further characterize the interactions between gp4 and gene 2.5 protein (gp2.5), we have examined the effect of wild-type and altered gene 2.5 proteins as well as Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein on the ability of gp4 to synthesize primers, hydrolyze dTTP, and unwind duplex DNA. Wild-type gp2.5 and E. coli SSB protein stimulate primer synthesis and DNA-unwinding activities of gp4 at low concentrations but do not significantly affect single-stranded DNA-dependent hydrolysis of dTTP. Neither protein inhibits the binding of gp4 to single-stranded DNA. The variant gene 2.5 proteins, gp2.5-F232L and gp2.5-Δ26C, inhibit primase, dTTPase, and helicase activities proportional to their increased affinities for DNA. Interestingly, wild-type gp2.5 stimulates the unwinding activity of gp4 except at very high concentrations, whereas E. coli SSB protein is highly inhibitory at relative low concentrations. Gene 4 protein (gp4) of bacteriophage T7 provides two essential functions at the T7 replication fork, primase and helicase activities. Previous studies have shown that the single-stranded DNA-binding protein of T7, encoded by gene 2.5, interacts with gp4 and modulates its multiple functions. To further characterize the interactions between gp4 and gene 2.5 protein (gp2.5), we have examined the effect of wild-type and altered gene 2.5 proteins as well as Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein on the ability of gp4 to synthesize primers, hydrolyze dTTP, and unwind duplex DNA. Wild-type gp2.5 and E. coli SSB protein stimulate primer synthesis and DNA-unwinding activities of gp4 at low concentrations but do not significantly affect single-stranded DNA-dependent hydrolysis of dTTP. Neither protein inhibits the binding of gp4 to single-stranded DNA. The variant gene 2.5 proteins, gp2.5-F232L and gp2.5-Δ26C, inhibit primase, dTTPase, and helicase activities proportional to their increased affinities for DNA. Interestingly, wild-type gp2.5 stimulates the unwinding activity of gp4 except at very high concentrations, whereas E. coli SSB protein is highly inhibitory at relative low concentrations. The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; gp4 and gp2.5, gene 4 protein and gene 2.5 protein, respectively; WT, wild type; SSB protein, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; nt, nucleotide. -binding protein of bacteriophage T7, encoded by gene 2.5 of the phage, is essential for T7 DNA replication and hence for growth of the phage (1Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10173-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Gene 2.5 protein (gp2.5) is one of four proteins that constitute a T7 replisome capable of mediating DNA replication in which leading and lagging strand syntheses are coordinated and the size distribution of Okazaki fragments is maintained via a replication loop formed from the lagging strand (2Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 3Lee J. Chastain P.D. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition to gp2.5 the replisome contains T7 gene 5 DNA polymerase, its processivity factor Escherichia coli thioredoxin, and the multifunctional T7 gene 4 helicase-primase or gp4 (4Richardson C.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 315-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Gp2.5 is unique among these proteins in that it not only binds to ssDNA but also physically interacts with both T7 DNA polymerase and gp4 (5Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Churchich J.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the consequences of the interaction of gp2.5 with ssDNA and with T7 DNA polymerase have been characterized (5Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Churchich J.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7He Z.G. Rezende L.F. Willox S. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29538-29545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), little is known regarding the effect of gp2.5 on the helicase and primase activities of T7 gp4. Gp2.5 belongs to a class of ubiquitous proteins that are not only essential for DNA replication but also play key roles in DNA recombination and repair (8Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chase J.W. Williams K.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 103-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Gp2.5, for example, is essential for recombination in T7 phage-infected cells and in vitro it mediates homologous base pairing (10Tabor S. Richardson C.C. ****. July 9, 1996; (U. S. Patent 5,534,407)Google Scholar, 11Rezende L.F. Willcox S. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29098-29105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Despite a lack of sequence homology, T7 gp2.5 is both structurally and functionally similar to the extensively studied ssDNA-binding protein of E. coli (SSB protein) and the gene 32 protein of bacteriophage T4. A recent crystal structure of a truncated gp2.5 (12Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) revealed that it contains an oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding fold conserved among members of the SSB protein family including E. coli SSB protein and T4 gene 32 protein. Although structurally and functionally similar, neither E. coli SSB protein nor T4 gene 32 protein can substitute T7 gp2.5 for T7 growth (1Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10173-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the functional interactions of gp2.5 with ssDNA and with T7 DNA polymerase and gp4 that account for this specificity have been difficult to dissect. First to be addressed is the ability of each of the latter two proteins to load onto ssDNA coated with gp2.5. T7 gp2.5 binds to ssDNA with a 10-fold lower affinity (Kd = 4.6 × 10-6 m) than does E. coli SSB protein or T4 gene 32 protein (8Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, T7 DNA polymerase readily extends a primer on ssDNA coated with gp2.5, E. coli SSB protein, or T4 gene 32 protein (5Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Churchich J.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, gp4 cannot mediate strand transfer in the presence of gene 32 protein, presumably because it can not load onto ssDNA coated with gene 32 protein (14Kong D. Nossal N.G. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8380-8387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Strand transfer mediated by the gene 4 helicase readily occurs in the presence of gp2.5 (14Kong D. Nossal N.G. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8380-8387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). T7 gp2.5, E. coli SSB protein, and T4 gene 32 protein all have an acidic C terminus of which a number of studies shown are essential for the protein-protein interactions observed in vitro (6Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7He Z.G. Rezende L.F. Willox S. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

A truncated gp2.5, gp2.5-Δ21C, lacking the 21 C-terminal residues cannot support T7 growth, and the purified protein cannot form dimers or physically interact with T7 DNA polymerase or gp4 (6Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the C termini of these proteins are essential for protein-protein interactions, they are not responsible for the specificity observed for T7 growth. Chimeric proteins in which the acidic C termini of either E. coli SSB protein or T4 gene 32 protein were substituted for the C terminus of gp2.5 support the growth of T7 phage lacking gene 2.5. Furthermore, they dimerized and physically interacted with gp4 and T7 DNA polymerase. On the other hand, chimeric proteins consisting of SSB protein or gene 32 protein bearing the T7 acidic terminus could not support the growth of T7 lacking gene 2.5 (13Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Using a random mutagenesis procedure, we recently isolated a number of gp2.5s having single amino acid substitutions that could not support T7 growth (20Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Whereas studies with these altered proteins led to the identification of sites that affected DNA binding (7He Z.G. Rezende L.F. Willox S. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29538-29545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Hyland E.M. Rezende L.R. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 29098-29105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), none of the altered proteins appeared to be defective in interactions with gp4 or T7 DNA polymerase. One altered protein, gp2.5-F232L, identified in the study, had a single amino acid substitution in the C-terminal residue (20Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Gp2.5-F232L binds more tightly to ssDNA (Kd = 1.5 × 10-6 m) than does WT gp2.5 but not as tightly as gp2.5-Δ21C (Kd = 1.1 × 10-7 m) (7He Z.G. Rezende L.F. Willox S. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29538-29545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Gp2.5-F232L stimulates T7 DNA polymerase activity on ssDNA even more so than does WT gp2.5, whereas gp2.5-Δ21C inhibits T7 DNA polymerase activity. This result clearly shows the importance of the C-terminal tail in interactions with the polymerase. Less well studied are the effects of gp2.5 on the helicase and primase activities of the T7 gp4. The helicase and primase activities of gp4 reside in the C-terminal and N-terminal halves of the 63-kDa protein, respectively (22Mendelman L.V. Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10638-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence encoding each domain has been independently cloned, and the respective helicase and primase fragments have been overproduced and purified (22Mendelman L.V. Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10638-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of both the helicase (23Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S.

Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) and primase (25Kato M. Ito T. Wagner G. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 111: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (90) Google Scholar) fragments are available. The helicase and primase fragments have helicase and primase activities, respectively, equivalent to that of the wild-type full-length gp4. However, as discussed below, the helicase domain, when covalently attached to the primase domain as in the full-length protein, bestows several desirable properties on the primase domain. The multiple activities catalyzed by the gp4, many of which involve interactions with ssDNA, likewise provide multiple reactions that are potential targets for gp2.5. For this reason, it is important to review briefly the reactions mediated by each domain of the gp4. Reactions mediated by the C-terminal helicase domain require the assembly of the protein into a hexamer. In the presence of dTTP, the 63-kDa gp4 assembles as a hexamer on ssDNA (26Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 27Yu X. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with a polarity such that the helicase domain faces the 3′-end of the DNA to which it is bound (26Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A major stabilization of the hexamer is dependent on the linker region that connects the helicase and primase domains (23Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1999; 99: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 24Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 28Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30303-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Once bound to ssDNA, the protein then translocates unidirectionally from 5′ to 3′ on the strand, a reaction coupled to the hydrolysis of dTTP (29Kim D.E. Narayan M. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 30Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Upon encountering a duplex provided that there is a 3′-ssDNA tail on the strand that it encounters, it will unwind the duplex. Gp2.5 bound to ssDNA and/or to the gp4 could facilitate the loading of the hexamer onto ssDNA. Unlike the DnaB helicase of E. coli or the gene 41 helicase of phage T4 (31Hinton D.M. Silver L.L. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12851-12857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Barry J. Albert B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 330-362Google Scholar), the T7 helicase does not have a specific helicase loader. Once loaded onto ssDNA, the presence of gp2.5-coated ssDNA could conceivably facilitate or hinder translocation of the gp4. The N-terminal primase domain catalyzes the template-directed synthesis of oligoribonucleotides on ssDNA, and these, in turn, are transferred to the T7 DNA polymerase for use as primers to initiate DNA synthesis (33Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 39-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). At the basic primase recognition site, 5′-GTC-3′, the primase catalyzes the synthesis of the dinucleotides pppAC from ATP and CTP (34Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Provided that the more extensive recognition sites are present, 5′-GGGTC-3′, 5′-TGGTC-3′, or 5′-GTGTC-3′ and the functional tetraribonucleotide primers, pppACCC, pppACCA, and pp-pACAC are synthesized (30Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A major role in sequence recognition is mediated by a Cys4 zinc motif located at the extreme N terminus of the primase domain (5Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Churchich J.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 85: 396-400Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Obviously, the effect of gp2.5-coated DNA on the recognition of the primase sites and the subsequent synthesis of the primer are of considerable importance. The primase fragment lacking the helicase domain catalyzes the template-directed synthesis of oligoribonucleotides equally as well as does the full-length gp4 in the absence of dTTP (36Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the primase fragment alone has a very low affinity for ssDNA and for its recognition site (37Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35889-35898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Consequently, the 63-kDa gp4 has markedly higher primase activity in the presence of dTTP because of the ability of the hexameric helicase to bind tightly to ssDNA (36Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). On long DNA templates with a scarcity of primase recognition sites, the primase is dependent on translocation by the helicase domain for delivery to these sites (36Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As a result, gp2.5 could have an indirect effect on primase activity via its interaction with the helicase domain. In a recent paper (7He Z.G. Rezende L.F. Willox S. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29538-29545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of wild-type gp2.5 and variants of gp2.5 for their ability to bind to ssDNA and to interact with T7 DNA polymerase. Wild-type gp2.5 was found to slightly stimulate DNA synthesis catalyzed by T7 DNA polymerase on ssDNA templates. The ability of T7 DNA polymerase to catalyze synthesis through gp2.5-coated DNA is dependent on the presence of the acidic C-terminal tail in that gp2.5-Δ26C lacking the 26 C-terminal amino acids inhibits synthesis by >10-fold (7He Z.G. Rezende L.F. Willox S. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29538-29545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this communication, we examined the effect of gp2.5 on the multiple activities catalyzed by the helicase and primase domains of gp4. In these studies, we have used two altered gp2.5s, gp2.5-Δ26C and gp2.5-F232L, as well as the wild-type gp2.5. Gp2.5-ΔF232L has a single amino acid substitution in the C-terminal tail that increases its binding to ssDNA yet does not affect its interaction with the T7 replication proteins (7He Z.G. Rezende L.F. Willox S. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29538-29545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, we have examined the effect of E. coli SSB protein on these reactions to examine the specificity for gp2.5 in the T7 system. Bacterial Strains, Bacteriophages, and Plasmids—E. coli BL21(DE3)-(F-ompT hsdSB (rB-mB-) gal-dcm (DE3)) (Novagen) was used as the host strain to express T7 gene 2.5 and to purify wild-type and mutant gp2.5. Wild-type and mutant gene 2.5 are expressed from the pET17b plasmid (Novagen) containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. T7 gp2.5-Δ26C was obtained from Edel Hyland (Harvard Medical School).

Oligoribonucleotide Synthesis by T7 DNA Primase—The synthesis of oligoribonucleotides catalyzed by gp4 was determined by measuring the incorporation of [α-32P]CMP into oligoribonucleotides using M13 ssDNA or synthetic DNA templates (Table I) containing a primase recognition site (34Mendelman L.V.

The reaction (10 μl) included 4 nm M13 ssDNA or 400 nm oligonucleotide, 0.3 mm each of ATP and [α-32P]CTP (0.1 μCi), 0.5 mm dTTP, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm potassium glutamate, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction mixtures were preincubated with the indicated amount of ssDNA-binding proteins for 5 min at 37 °C, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of either 80 nm gp4 monomer or 800 nm gp4 primase fragment. After further incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 3 μl of sequencing dye (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% xylene cyanol FF, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and loaded onto a 25% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 3 m urea. After electrophoresis, the radioactive oligoribonucleotide products were analyzed using a Fuji BAS 1000 Bioimaging analyzer. dTTPase Assay—Gp4 catalyzes the ssDNA-dependent hydrolysis of dTTP, a reaction coupled to its translocation on ssDNA (38Matson S.W.

The reaction (10 μl) contained 1.2 nm M13 ssDNA, 0.5 mm [α-32P]dTTP (0.1 μCi), 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm potassium glutamate. The reaction mixtures were preincubated with the indicated amount of ssDNA-binding protein for 5 min at 37 °C, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of 80 nm gp4. After further incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reactions were terminated by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm. The reaction mixture was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate. The TLC plate was developed with a solution containing 1 m formic acid and 0.8 m LiCl. The TLC plate was analyzed using a Fuji BAS 1000 Bioimaging analyzer.

J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14017-14024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A helicase substrate was prepared by annealing a 5′-end-labeled 75-mer oligonucleotide S75 (Table I) to a 95-mer oligonucleotide L95 (Table I) in 0.1 m NaCl. The helicase reaction (10 μl) contained 60 nm DNA substrate, 1 mm dTTP, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm potassium glutamate. The reaction mixtures were preincubated with the indicated amount of ssDNA-binding protein for 5 min at 37 °C, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of 80 nm gp4. After further incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the radioactive oligonucleotide disassociated from the partial duplex was measured using a Fuji BAS 1000 Bioimaging analyzer. In a control experiment in which 60 nm each of ssDNA 75 and 95-mer were incubated, we found that there is significant annealing (∼30%) of the DNA strands. Therefore, it is likely that some reannealing of ssDNA strands arising during the helicase reaction occurs, thus leading to an underestimation of DNA unwinding. Effect of Gp2.5 and E. coli SSB Protein on Primer Synthesis—An earlier study using a gp4 preparation enriched for the 63-kDa species showed that gp2.5-stimulated gp4 catalyzed oligoribonucleotide synthesis on M13 ssDNA 3.5-fold (40Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9831-9839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies confirmed this result and also revealed that gp2.5-Δ21C, lacking its C-terminal 21 amino acids, severely inhibited oligoribonucleotide synthesis (13Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In that study, E. coli SSB protein stimulated oligoribonucleotide synthesis ∼2-fold, whereas T4 gp32 protein inhibited synthesis by >10-fold (13Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To further characterize these interactions, we examined the ability of WT gp2.5 and E. coli SSB protein to affect gp4-catalyzed primer synthesis at various concentrations. Primase activity was assayed using M13 ssDNA coated with either WT gp2.5 or E. coli SSB protein. Consistent with the previous studies, both gp2.5 and E. coli SSB protein stimulated oligoribonucleotide synthesis ∼2-3 fold (Fig. 1A). Our earlier studies using gel shift analysis have shown that 1 μm gp2.5 is sufficient to coat 3.3 nm 70-mer ssDNA (21Hyland E.M. Rezende L.R. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7247-7256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this experiment containing 4 nm M13 ssDNA, we used a gp2.5 concentration of 20 μm, which is sufficient to coat 20 nm M13 ssDNA based on the assumption that one gp2.5 molecule coats 6-7 nucleotides on ssDNA (8Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli SSB protein has approximately a 10-fold higher affinity for ssDNA relative to gp2.5 (8Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, maximal stimulation occurred with the lowest amount of gp2.5 (2 μm), an amount sufficient to coat 50% of the ssDNA. E. coli SSB protein stimulated oligoribonucleotide synthesis at an even lower concentration of 0.2 μm (Fig. 1A). To eliminate the effect of secondary structure in the M13 DNA substrate, we used a 70-mer oligonucleotide, ZH70, containing only one primase site as a template (Table I) to analyze primer synthesis. For the assay, an increasing concentration of ssDNA-binding protein was present to coat the ssDNA in the reaction. Consistent with the results obtained with M13 ssDNA, both WT gp2.5 and E. coli SSB protein stimulated the primase activity of gp4 at low concentrations (Fig. 1B).

The character of the block changes as a function of the size of the CD relative to the connexin pore diameter, suggesting that the block occurs via entry of the CD into the pore lumen and occlusion of the permeability pathway. The block occurs only when the CD is applied to the side of the pore that is normally cytoplasmic and not from the side that is normally extracellular. The block is potentiated when organic analytes are sequestered in the hydrophobic interior of the CDs. CDs may be useful as molecular tools with which to explore the structure of the connexin pore and to alter molecular movement through connexin channels.

Connexin channels, which compose gap junctions, mediate direct intercellular movement of cytoplasmic signaling molecules. There are ∼20 isoforms of connexin protein (1Willecke K. Eiberger J. Degen J.

Every functional deletion of a connexin isoform produces a distinct pathology, and genetic replacement of one connexin by another (“knock-in”) fails to fully compensate (1Willecke K. Eiberger J.

Development. 2002; 129: 167-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pathologies that arise from altered connexin channel function must arise from abnormal molecular movement through connexin channels, whether in magnitude, regulation, or molecular specificity. Although the key biological function of each type of connexin channel is defined by which molecules permeate (and do not permeate) the pore, little is known about the structural locus of the molecular selectivity, the connexin pore itself. Specifically, the mechanisms of selective molecular permeability through connexin channels are not understood. In the absence of a high resolution structure, such understanding must come from molecular probes of the pore. For many channels, prior to the recent progress in crystallographic analysis, mechanisms of channel selectivity and permeation were elucidated by studies using hydrophilic molecular reagents that enter and/or occlude the conducting pathway (cf. Refs. 15Miller C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 5-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 16Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1975; 66: 535-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 17Yellen G. Jurman M.E. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1991; 251: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). For connexin channels, such molecular tools would be useful for identifying key amino acids and protein regions that line the pore and define its molecular selectivity; the absence of such tools has hindered progress in this area. This report identifies cyclodextrins as a class of pore blockers for connexin channels. Cyclodextrins (CDs) 1The abbreviations used are: CDs, cyclodextrins; αHL, α-hemolysin; Cx, connexin; TSF, transport-specific fractionation; HA, hemagglutinin; 3H2NA, 3-hydroxy-2-naphtholic acid; 2AA, 2-amino-adamantanamine. are cyclized glucose oligomers consisting of six or more glucose units. Their most stable molecular configuration is that of a toroid, wider at one end than the other, approximating a truncated cone with a hole down the center (Fig. 1). Hydroxyl groups on the external surface confer aqueous solubility, and linking glucosidic oxygen atoms lining the inner cavity give it a hydrophobic character, allowing CDs to sequester “guest” molecules (18Easton C.J. Lincoln S.F. Easton C.J. Lincoln S.F. Modified Cyclodextrins: Scaffolds and Templates for Supramolecular Chemistry. Imperial College Press, London1999Crossref Google Scholar). The unmodified naturally occurring CDs used in this study are uncharged. CDs have been shown to reversibly enter and modify the pore properties of α-hemolysin (αHL) (19Gu L.-Q. Braha O. Conlan S. Cheley S. Bayley H. Nature. 1999; 398: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) and CymA bacterial porin (20Pajatsch M. Andersen C. Mathes A. Bock A. Benz R. Engelhardt H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25159-25166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). When lodged in the αHL pore, CDs reduce the ionic conductance. The degree of conductance block and the stability of the CD within the αHL pore were potentiated when the cavity of the CD was occupied by small guest molecules. In this context, CDs have been referred to as “molecular adapters” (21Gu L.-Q. Serra M.D. Vincent J.B. Vigh G. Cheley S. Braha O. Bayley H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3959-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, CDs appear to fully block the ionic conductance of CymA pores (20Pajatsch M. Andersen C. Mathes A. Bock A. Benz R.

J. Med. Biol. Res. 2000; 33: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Connexin channels have two functional and structural forms. The basic unit is a hexamer, called a “hemichannel” or “connexon.” The hemichannel is the single membrane form of connexin channels, which can be found in the plasma membrane of many cells and has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes (28Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 29Ebihara L. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 100-103PubMed Google Scholar). Gap junction channels are end-to-end dimers of hemichannels. The intercellular location of gap junction channels presents challenges for detailed biophysical investigation; hemichannels are more amenable for study. By and large, the properties of junctional channels follow those of the component hemichannels (10Goldberg G.S. Lampe P.D. Sheedy D. Stewart C.C. Nicholson B.J. Naus C.C.G. Exp.

This paper reports that CDs can reversibly block molecular permeability through connexin hemichannels formed by connexin-32 (Cx32) and/or connexin-26 (Cx26). The correlation between the block and the relative sizes of the CDs and the connexin pores indicates that the block occurs by direct occlusion of the pore by the CDs. Preliminary reports of this work have appeared in abstract form (37Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 281Google Scholar, 38Locke D. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13 (abstr.): 352Google Scholar). Materials—Lipids (egg phosphatidylcholine, bovine brain phosphatidylserine, and lissamine rhodamine B-labeled egg phosphatidylethanolamine) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, IL); n-octyl β-d-glucoside was purchased from Calbiochem or Glycon Biochemicals (Luckenwalde, Germany). Bio-Gel (A-0.5m, 100–200 mesh, exclusion limit 500 kDa) was from Bio-Rad. Cyclodextrins were from Sigma. All other reagents were from Sigma unless stated. Purification of Homomeric Cx32 and Heteromeric Cx26/Cx32 Hemichannels from Rodent Liver—Connexin was immunopurified from n-octyl β-d-glucoside-solubilized crude plasma membranes from rat or mouse liver using a monoclonal antibody specific for Cx32, as described and characterized (39Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Previous biochemical and functional studies have shown that hemichannels purified in this manner from rat liver are predominantly homomeric Cx32 and from mouse liver are heteromeric Cx26/Cx32. The heteromeric channels are functionally heterogeneous, presumably because of heterogeneities of isoform stoichiometry and/or arrangement (25Bevans C.G. Kordel M. Rhee S.K. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2808-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 40Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3711-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The primary sequences of rat and mouse Cx32 are identical. The sequences for Cx26 have conservative substitutions at two positions, neither of which is in a membrane-spanning domain (ratnnmouse, Y68H and I215V). Reconstitution of Purified Connexin into Unilamellar Liposomes— Liposome formation and connexin incorporation into unilamellar liposomes followed the protocol described previously (39Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 41Harris A.L. Bevans C.G. Bruzzone R. Giaume C. Methods in Molecular Biology: Connexin Methods and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 357-377Google Scholar). Liposomes were formed by gel filtration of a 1 mg/ml mixture of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and rhodamine-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine at a molar ratio of 2:1:0.03 in urea buffer (see below) and affinity-purified connexin in 80 mm n-octyl β-d-glucoside. The protein/lipid/detergent mixture was applied to a column of Bio-Gel beads pretreated with sonicated liposomes. Connexin-containing liposomes were collected in the void volume. The protein/lipid ratio corresponded to an amount of connexin equivalent to less than one hemichannel per liposome so that some liposomes did not contain functional channels, which were used as internal controls in the permeability assay (TSF, described below). Transport-specific Fractionation (TSF)—Molecular permeation of connexin channels was assessed by TSF of the liposomes. TSF has been described and characterized previously (39Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 41Harris A.L. Bevans C.G. Bruzzone R. Giaume C. Methods in Molecular Biology: Connexin Methods and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 357-377Google Scholar, 42Harris A.L. Walter A. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 109: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). TSF separates liposomes into distinct populations within a density gradient by exploiting the permeability of an open connexin channel to two molecular solutes, urea and sucrose. The liposomes are formed in, and entrap, urea-containing solution and are centrifuged through linear iso-osmotic TSF density gradients formed from 459 mm urea (500 mOsm/kg, density (ρ) 1.0055 g/ml) and 400 mm sucrose (500 mOsm/kg, ρ 1.0511 g/ml). During centrifugation, urea and sucrose exchange through open connexin channels, equilibrating the aqueous solution density inside and outside the liposomes, making the phospholipid membrane the determinant of liposome density. The gradient is constructed so that the solution density equivalent to the density of phospholipid is near the bottom, so liposomes with and without functional channels band in the lower and upper regions of the gradients, respectively. The positions of liposomes are monitored via rhodamine-labeled lipid fluorescence (λex 570 nm, λem 590 nm) making it possible to visualize, collect, and quantitate the liposomes. The typical positions of the upper and lower bands are centered at densities of ∼1.02 and 1.04 g/ml, respectively. Liposomes that contain channels permeable to one solute but not the other undergo osmotically driven shrinkage that results in a band of intermediate density of ∼1.03 g/ml (43Harris A.L. Bevans C.G. Werner R. Gap Junctions. IOS Press, Amsterdam1997: 60-64Google Scholar, 44Bevans C. Brutyan R.A. DeMaria C. Harris A.L. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): 204Google Scholar). Because addition of CDs to the TSF gradients could affect the densities of the solutions, the bands were assigned as upper, intermediate, and lower on the basis of density determination by refractometry. Urea TSF buffer contained 10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 3 mm NaN3, and 459 mm urea at pH 7.6. Sucrose TSF buffer was identical to the urea buffer except that an osmotically equivalent concentration of sucrose (400 mm) was substituted for the urea. Equilibration of the TSF solutes across the liposome membrane through an open hemichannel is very rapid (milliseconds for these 900-Å liposomes (45Ollivon M. Walter A. Blumenthal R. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 262-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)), so any significant channel permeability to the solutes results in sufficient solute exchange to cause a liposome to move to a lower position determined by solute permeability. TSF is therefore an all-or-none assay of per liposome channel permeability. Stated another way, only complete block of TSF solute permeability through the connexin channel will cause a liposome containing a functional channel to remain at the upper position. A change in liposome distribution between the upper and either of the two lower band positions, relative to control, is a measure of a change in the fraction of channels that are permeable to the gradient solutes. Such a change can be due to pore block or to a reduction to zero of channel open probability. Purification of Tagged Homomeric Cx26 and Cx32 Hemichannels from Transfected HeLa Cells—Homomeric Cx26 and homomeric Cx32 hemichannels were purified from HeLa cells transfected with an inducible vector. The connexin coding sequence was followed by a sequence coding for a thrombin-cleavable C-terminal mass tag consisting of an HA epitope followed by a 6xHN sequence (46Koreen I.V. Liu Y.J. Harris A.L. Biophys. J. 2004; 86 (abstr.): 583Google Scholar). Connexin was immunopurified by using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody. The tag added ∼3.2 kDa to the coding protein. Thrombin Cleavage of Tagged Connexin—To 200 μl of purified protein or pre-formed connexin proteoliposomes (pH > 7), 5.0 units of thrombin (restriction grade thrombin as supplied; Novagen, Madison, WI) were added. The reaction was allowed to proceed on ice for 24 h and stopped by addition of 0.75 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate (final concentration) to inactivate the thrombin. Connexin Recovery from Detergent Solutions and from Liposomes— Connexin was recovered from detergent/lipid solutions according to Ref. 47Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal.

Reduction of Intraliposomal Cytochrome c by Extraliposomal Ascorbate—Bovine heart cytochrome c was entrapped into liposomes at a concentration of 5 mg/ml during reconstitution. To ensure that cytochrome c was available without dilution during the reconstitution, 2 ml of 5 mg/ml cytochrome c was loaded onto the gel filtration column prior to connexin/lipid/detergent. Osmolarity was maintained with NaCl rather than urea buffer. Patent hemichannels reconstituted into liposome membranes were identified by the reduction of intraliposomal cytochrome c by an external solution of 150 mm sodium ascorbate (49Ahmad S. Evans W.H. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 693-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of cytochrome c was measured by absorbance at 417 nm at 25 °C. Competitive Guest Complexation—Fluorescence emission intensity of 3-hydroxy-2-naphtholic acid (3H2NA; 20 μm) was measured at λex 350 nm and peak λem 521 nm (50Yi Z. Zhao C. Huang Z. Chen H. Yu J. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 1999; 1: 441-444Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of CDs and/or TSF buffer components at pH 7.4 and 25 °C using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). 3H2NA concentration and final volumes were kept constant. Measurements were made in double-distilled water with TSF buffer components added as indicated. Homomeric Cx32 channels and heteromeric Cx26/Cx32 channels were obtained from rat and mouse liver, respectively, as described and characterized previously (25Bevans C.G. Kordel M. Rhee S.K.

Homomeric Cx26 channels and additional homomeric Cx32 channels were obtained from HeLa cells expressing HA-6xHN-tagged connexin (46Koreen I.V. Liu Y.J. Harris A.L. Biophys.

The relative limiting pore widths of the homomeric and heteromeric channels were characterized in previous work using uncharged fluorescent carbohydrate probes (25Bevans C.G. Kordel M. Rhee S.K. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2808-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). 2D. Locke, T. Stein, C. Davies, J. Morris, A. L. Harris, P. Monaghan, and B.

The data showed that homomeric Cx32 channels have a wider limiting diameter for permeation by uncharged molecules than do homomeric Cx26 or heteromeric Cx26/Cx32 channels. This size distinction is supported by work in cellular systems (5Cao F.L. Eckert R. Elfgang C. Nitsche J.M. Snyder S.A. Hülser D.F. Willecke K. Nicholson B.J. J.

Hemichannels were reconstituted into unilamellar phospholipid liposomes. Molecular permeability of the reconstituted channels was assessed by TSF of the liposomes.

TSF separates liposomes into distinct populations within a density gradient on the basis of the permeability of an open connexin channel to two solutes of different densities (typically urea and sucrose; see “Experimental Procedures”). The salient feature is that liposomes that contain channels permeable to both gradient solutes come to an equilibrium position deep in the gradient, whereas liposomes that contain channels not permeable to the gradient solutes (or that contain no open channels) band near the top of the gradient. Liposomes that contain channels permeable to one solute but not the other undergo osmotically driven shrinkage that results in a band of intermediate density (43Harris A.L. Bevans C.G. Werner R. Gap Junctions. IOS Press, Amsterdam1997: 60-64Google Scholar, 44Bevans C. Brutyan R.A. DeMaria C. Harris A.L. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): 204Google Scholar). TSF is of particular utility in the study of connexin channels because of the constraints of studying connexin channels in situ and their apparent refractoriness to functional reconstitution in planar bilayers (30Harris A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, TSF focuses on molecular permeability, not ionic conductance, which is the key functional property of connexin channels in most tissues. The three CDs used in these studies are as follows: αCD (6 glucose units), βCD (7 glucose units), and γCD (8 glucose units). Their approximate dimensions are given in Fig. 1. The diameters of the internal cavities and the external widths of the CDs increase with the number of glucose subunits. The external widths approach and exceed the minimal pore widths of connexin channels inferred from tracer studies (58Verselis V.K. Veenstra R.D. Hertzberg E.L. Gap Junctions. Jai Press, Inc., Stamford2000: 129-192Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, CDs were applied by including them in the TSF gradients. βCD is known to affect membranes by sequestering cholesterol (which fits well in the internal cavity) (59Kilsdonk E.P.C. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), but the liposomes used in these studies contained no cholesterol. In this report TSF is used to assess permeability to gradient solutes: the fraction of the liposomes in the lower band(s) is the fraction permeable to one or both solutes. This fraction, normalized to controls (e.g. without CD), is depicted as the fraction of channels that are unblocked. Cyclodextrin Block of Homomeric Cx32 Channels—The two smaller CDs (αCD and βCD) show complete block of homomeric Cx32 channels at CD concentrations of ∼6 and ∼15 mm, respectively (Fig. 2, upper panel, left and middle graphs). Above these concentrations, permeability to urea and sucrose was blocked; there was no lower TSF band. An intermediate band (indicating permeability to urea but not to sucrose) did not occur at any concentration. The step-change nature of the block-concentration relation for these CDs is expected for simple block of a homogeneous channel population. Because solute equilibration through a connexin channel across a liposome membrane is rapid, the solute permeability of a given liposome/channel reported by TSF is essentially all-or-none, either a liposome is detectably permeable to the gradient solutes or it is not. Only complete block of the TSF solutes will cause a liposome containing a functional channel to remain at the upper position. A step in the block-concentration relation occurs at the concentration at which channel occupancy by the blocker is essentially complete in the population of channels. TSF does not give classical Michaelis-Menten binding parameters (e.g. a Km), because it fractionates liposomes according to whether the channels they contain have permeability/open probability greater than a very low threshold. Consequently, the concentration of a compound that produces block detectable in TSF is much greater than that needed to see an effect in biochemical studies and corresponds to the concentration needed for blocker occupancy very close to 1.0. These data therefore indicate simple block of permeability to urea and sucrose by αCD and βCD. The effects of the largest CD, γCD, on Cx32 channels are more complex and the mechanism less clear. The γCD data differ in two ways. The first is that the block-concentration relation has a different shape; block develops in a graded fashion with increasing CD concentration (Fig. 2, upper panel, right graph). For a homogeneous channel population, this shape of curve is inconsistent with simple block. The other difference is that in the concentration range that shows graded block (∼5–15 mm), the only lower TSF band was at the intermediate density position. This indicates permeability of the connexin channels to urea but not to sucrose; in this concentration range there was no band of liposomes corresponding to the density position indicating permeability to both gradient solutes. In other words, in the concentration range where an increasing fraction of the channels was blocked to both solutes, the other channels were blocked to sucrose but not to urea. These data show interaction of the γCD with the pore, but that it is of a different character than that of the smaller CDs. It seems reasonable to attribute"
https://openalex.org/W2076427794,"The gene 4 protein of bacteriophage T7 provides both helicase and primase activities. The C-terminal helicase domain is responsible for DNA-dependent dTTP hydrolysis, translocation, and DNA unwinding whereas the N-terminal primase domain is responsible for template-directed oligoribonucleotide synthesis. A 26 amino acid linker region (residues 246-271) connects the two domains and is essential for the formation of functional hexamers. In order to further dissect the role of the linker region, three residues (Ala257, Pro259, and Asp263) that was disordered in the crystal structure of the hexameric helicase fragment were substituted with all amino acids, and the altered proteins were analyzed for their ability to support growth of T7 phage lacking gene 4. The in vivo screening revealed Ala257 and Asp263 to be essential whereas Pro259 could be replaced with any amino acid without loss of function. Selected gene 4 proteins with substitution for Ala257 or Asp263 were purified and examined for their ability to unwind DNA, hydrolyze dTTP, translocate on ssDNA, and oligomerize. In the presence of Mg2+, all of the altered proteins oligomerize. However, in the absence of divalent ion, alterations at position 257 increase the extent of oligomerization whereas those at position 263 reduce oligomer formation. Although dTTP hydrolysis activity is reduced only 2-3-fold, none of the altered gene 4 proteins can translocate effectively on single-strand DNA, and they cannot mediate the unwinding of duplex DNA. Primer synthesis catalyzed by the altered proteins is relatively normal on a short DNA template but it is severely impaired on longer templates where translocation is required. The results suggest that the linker region not only connects the two domains of the gene 4 protein and participates in oligomerization, but also contributes to helicase activity by mediating conformations within the functional hexamer.

The replisomes of essentially all replication systems have five essential components, a DNA polymerase, a processivity factor for the polymerase, a DNA helicase, a DNA primase, and a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; pfu, plaque-forming unit.1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; pfu, plaque-forming unit.-binding protein (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). The replisome of bacteriophage T7 is unique in that the proteins that account for these five functions mediate coordinated leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis without the aid of other accessory proteins such as clamp-loading proteins and helicase-loading proteins (2Lee J. Chastain II, P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All of these activities with the exception of the processivity factor are encoded by the phage. The economy of proteins in the phage T7 system is also manifest in the residence of the helicase and primase within a single polypeptide, the T7-encoded gene 4 protein (3Richardson C.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 315-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 4Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). There is a requirement for an association of DNA primase with its cognate helicase in all replication systems, but the two proteins are usually encoded by distinct and separate genes, thus necessitating an association at the replication fork. As shown in Fig. 1, the helicase and primase activities of the gene 4 protein each reside in separate domains located in the C-terminal and N-terminal halves of the 63-kDa gene 4 protein, respectively (5Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence encoding each domain has been cloned and the resulting helicase and primase fragments have full helicase and primase activities, respectively (6Bird L.E. Hakansson K. Pan H. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2620-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30303-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, each domain, particularly the primase domain, is impaired in specific reactions when it is not coupled to the other domain. The crystal structures of both the helicase (9Sawaya M.R. Guo S.

Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and primase (11Kato M. Ito T. Wagner G. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) domains have been solved. Like other DNA helicases of the DnaB family, the gene 4 protein functions as a hexamer (12Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The hexameric gene 4 protein binds tightly to single-stranded DNA in the presence of dTTP and uses the energy of hydrolysis of dTTP to translocate unidirectionally 5′ to 3′ on the DNA strand to which it is bound (13Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of C-terminal helicase fragments of the gene 4 protein demonstrated that the region of the gene 4 protein linking the primase and helicase domains (residues 246-271) is critical for oligomerization (8Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30303-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The primase and helicase domains of gene 4 protein share extensive homology with primases and helicases from other organisms (5Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, this small portion of residues 246 through 271 does not share amino acid sequence with other members of either the helicase or primase families, and thus was defined as the linker region. Helicase fragments lacking this linker region failed to oligomerize except at extremely high protein concentration and were severely impaired for all helicase activities (8Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30303-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the hexameric helicase fragment subsequently revealed that the subunit interface of the helicase ring is stabilized by interactions between an N-terminal region (residues 264-284 or helix A) of one subunit and a pocket on the adjacent subunit (residues 364-395 or helices D2 to D3) (10Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Thus, a portion of the linker region identified by biochemical studies (residues 246-271) is found in this interaction. However, residues 241-260 in the structure were poorly ordered. In addition to these interactions at the interface, a series of loops near the nucleotide binding site also make contact between adjacent subunits with potential contacts of adjacent subunits with the bound nucleotide. While it is clear from the biochemical and structural data that the linker region is essential for oligomerization of the gene 4 protein, the identity of the key residues critical for protein-protein interaction are unknown since previous studies have made use of truncated helicase domains. Furthermore, it is not known if the linker region via its contact with adjacent subunits assists in coordinating helicase and primase activities at the replication fork. One study (15Rosenberg A.H. Griffin M. Washington M.T. Patel S.S. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26819-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) involving a random mutagenesis of the entire T7 gene 4 protein did find that substitutions of residues within this region such as A257T, A257V, and G258D give rise to proteins that cannot support T7 phage lacking gene 4. One of these altered proteins, a gene 4 protein with the substitution of threonine for alanine at position 257 (gp4-A257T), had reduced dTTPase activity and no DNA unwinding activity. In order to define more precisely the role of the linker, we have carried out an extensive study of three amino acid residues (Ala257, Pro259, and Asp263) all located in the linker region. Three libraries of gene 4 were generated such that each of the three amino acids was replaced with all other amino acids, and the resulting proteins were analyzed for their ability to support T7 phage lacking gene 4. We find that two of these residues, Ala257 and Asp263, play a critical role in oligomerization and translocation of the gene 4 protein. Materials—Oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. Plasmid DNA purification kits were from Qiagen. Restriction endonucleases, alkaline phosphatase, and Deep Vent® polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs. T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, radiolabeled nucleotides, high molecular weight protein markers, and desalting column S-400HR were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Agarose and β,γ-methylene dTTP were from USB Corp. Polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were from J. T. Baker. T7 DNA polymerase (T7 gene 5 protein-Escherichia coli thioredoxin complex), M13mp18 ssDNA, and a primer used for strand displacement DNA synthesis assay were kindly provided by Donald Johnson (Harvard Medical School). Random Mutagenesis of Selected Codons—Random mutagenesis of the codons specifying Ala257, Pro259, and Asp263 in gene 4 protein was carried out using primers containing mixed nucleotides at these positions. The codon site was flanked by 10-12 nucleotides of the wild-type sequence. For example, a set of primers for Ala257 was 5′-CAAGTGTGGAATNNNGGTCCTTGGATT-3′ and 5′-AATCCAAGGACCNNNATTCCACACTTG-3′ (N, any base). Using these mutagenic primers and outside primers in a two-step overlap PCR procedure (16Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a pool of DNA containing mutated codons was generated. After digestion with BstBI and Bsu36I, the DNA (0.62 pmol) was ligated into plasmid pET24gp4-63 (0.049 pmol) previously cut with the same restriction enzymes. One-third of the ligation reaction mixture was transformed into 0.1 ml of E. coli strain DH5α (2.6 × 108 cells) by heat shock at 42 °C for 1 min followed by the addition of 0.9 ml of SOC medium. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and 0.1 ml of the culture was spread onto agar plates layered with either T7Δ4 phage or no phage. After overnight growth, bacterial colonies that emerged from plates infected with T7Δ4 phage (1 × 107 pfu) were picked and re-streaked on a new plate. Inability of the isolated colonies to support T7Δ4 phage was confirmed by infecting separate bacterial cultures with the phage. Plasmid DNA from the surviving bacteria was prepared and the integrity of the gene 4 coding region near the substitution site was examined by restriction enzyme analysis with SnaBI and AflII. Finally, the DNA sequence of the gene 4 coding from Gly179 through Ser312 of the protein was determined by the DNA sequencing facility at The Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. Protein Overproduction and Purification—The entire gene 4 coding region of selected gene 4 proteins was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The plasmids were transformed into E. coli HMS 174(DE3), and gene 4 proteins were overproduced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. Genetically altered gene 4 proteins were purified following procedures described previously (16Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were all greater than 95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis and staining with Coomassie Blue. Biochemical Assays of Gene 4 Protein—Most of the assays used in this study have been described previously in detail (16Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All assays (DNA unwinding, DNA binding, dTTP hydrolysis, oligomerization of gene 4 protein, primer synthesis, and DNA synthesis assays) used a reaction buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm potassium glutamate plus additional components described in each assay. All reactions were carried out at 37 °C for the indicated time period. DNA Unwinding Assay—The DNA substrate for DNA unwinding assay was prepared by annealing a 5′-32P radiolabeled 45-mer (5′-ATAAC TCTAT GCACA TTGAC CATGC TTCAG ATTCG TATTG TTACT-3′) to a 65-mer (5′-TTTTT TTTTT TTTTT TTTTT ATTCG TAATC CGACC TCGAG GCATG GTCAA TGTGC ATAGA GTTAT-3′) in 50 mm NaCl. The DNA substrate (100 nm) was incubated with the indicated amounts of gene 4 protein for 5 min in the presence of 0.5 mm dTTP. After termination of the reaction by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm, the reaction mixture was loaded onto a 10% non-denaturing gel. Oligonucleotides separated from the partial duplex substrate by the helicase were measured using a Fuji BAS 1000 Bioimaging analyzer. In a control experiment in which 100 nm each of ssDNA 45- and 65-mer were incubated, we found that there is significant annealing (∼60%) of the DNA strands. Therefore, it is likely that some reannealing of the ssDNA strands arising during the helicase reaction occurs thus leading to an underestimation of DNA unwinding. However, lowering the DNA concentration 10-fold to reduce the annealing does not alter the results. DNA Binding Assay—DNA binding affinity of gene 4 protein was measured by nitrocellulose (NC) filter binding. The reaction (10 μl) containing 1.3 nm of 5′-32P-radiolabeled DNA (5′-GGGTCA10-3′) was incubated with various amounts of gene 4 protein in the presence of 1 mm non-hydrolyzable β,γ-methylene dTTP for 30 min. The reaction mixture was loaded onto two layers of filters, a NC membrane (0.45 μm, Bio-Rad) laid atop a Zeta-Probe® membrane (Bio-Rad) fixed on a Dot microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad). The protein-DNA complex bound to the NC membrane and free DNA on the Zeta-Probe® membrane was measured using a Fuji BAS 1000 Bioimaging analyzer. DNA-dependent Hydrolysis of dTTP—ssDNA-dependent hydrolysis of dTTP by gene 4 protein was determined by incubating 0.25 mm [α-32P]dTTP (0.1 μCi), 8 nm M13 ssDNA with the indicated concentration of the protein for 20 min. After termination of the reaction by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm, the reaction mixture was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine cellulose TLC plate. The TLC plate was developed with a solution containing 1 m formic acid and 0.8 m LiCl. The amount of [α-32P]dTDP formed in the reaction was measured using a Fuji BAS 1000 Bioimaging analyzer. Oligomerization of Gene 4 Proteins—The ability of gene 4 protein to oligomerize was determined by analyzing the oligomerized protein by electrophoresis on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The complete reaction (20 μl) contained 1 μm gene 4 protein, 1 mm β,γ-methylene dTTP, and 0.1 μm 45-mer oligonucleotide (5′-AGAGC GTCAC TCTTG TGACT ACCAG TGGTC GCAAA GTTCT TATCT-3′). After incubation for 20 min at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was loaded onto a 10% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 4 °C for 5 h. Gel running buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 190 mm glycine) contained 10 mm Mg(OAc)2 or did not. The protein was stained with Coomassie Blue in order to visualize the oligomerized protein. Primase Assay—Template-directed oligoribonucleotide synthesis was determined by measuring the incorporation of [α-32P]CMP into oligoribonucleotides using a synthetic DNA template containing a primase recognition site. The reaction (10 μl) included the indicated template, 0.1 mm each of ATP and [α-32P]CTP (0.1 μCi), and the indicated amount of gene 4 protein. The DNA template was 100 μm 6-mer (5′-GGGTCA-3′) or 1 μm 65-mer used for DNA unwinding substrate. In the case of the 65-mer, the indicated amounts of dTTP or β,γ-methylene dTTP were added in the reaction. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 3 μl of sequencing dye and loaded onto a 25% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 3 m urea. Electrophoresis was carried out at 1800 V for 3 h, and the gel was dried. Radioactive oligoribonucleotide products were analyzed using a Fuji BAS 1000 Bioimaging analyzer. Strand Displacement DNA Synthesis by T7 DNA Polymerase—A DNA template used to measure DNA strand displacement DNA synthesis was prepared by annealing M13 ssDNA in 10 mm NaCl to a 5′-32P radiolabeled 66-mer primer (5′-T36AATTC GTAAT CATGG TCATA GCTGT TTCCT-3′) to create a non-complementary T36 tail at the 5′-end of a 30-bp duplex region. Excess primers in the annealing mixture were removed using a desalting column S-400HR. The reaction containing 5 nm template DNA, 0.3 mm of all four dNTPs, and 10 nm T7 DNA polymerase was initiated for 2 min before the indicated amounts of gene 4 protein were added. After incubation for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm and loaded on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide. The gel was run in a buffer (45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA) and dried for autoradiography. RNA-primed DNA Synthesis by T7 DNA Polymerase—The ability of gene 4 protein to prime DNA synthesis catalyzed by T7 DNA polymerase on M13 ssDNA was measured by incubating 9.8 nm M13 ssDNA, 0.3 mm each of dTTP, dCTP, dATP, and [α-32P]dGTP (0.1 μCi), 0.1 mm each of ATP and CTP, 100 nm gene 4 protein, and 20 nm T7 DNA polymerase. After incubation for 5 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm and spotted onto a DE-81 membrane (Whatman). The amount of radioactively synthesized DNA was determined by measuring the radioactive products retained on the membrane after washing the membrane three times with 10 ml of 0.3 m ammonium formate (pH 8.0). A short segment of 26 amino acids lacking homology to members of either the helicase or primase families has been termed the “linker region” (5Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Biochemical data suggested that this linker region is critical for the functioning of the gene 4 protein (8Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30303-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As anticipated from the biochemical data, crystal structures of the helicase domains revealed residues in the linker of one subunit of the hexamer contacting residues in the adjacent subunit, thus contributing to the stability of the hexamer (9Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1999; 99: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 10Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Although the structure showed clearly the participation of the linker in subunit interaction, 9 of 26 residues were disordered in the structure. In order to examine the role of these 9 amino acids in helicase-primase function, we selected three for detailed analysis. Residues Pro259 and Asp263 were chosen since they are conserved in gene 4 protein of phage T3 where the primase is also fused to the helicase. Residue Ala257 was included in this study since alteration at this position had been shown previously to affect DNA-dependent dTTP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding (17Washington M.T. Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Studier F.W. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26825-26834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The codons for each of the three selected amino acid residues were mutated randomly in gene 4 and cloned into a plasmid so as to give rise to all possible amino acid substitutions at these three sites (see “Experimental Procedure”). In order to select for altered gene 4 proteins that were defective in primase and/or helicase activity, we first selected for gene 4 proteins that could not support the growth of T7Δ4 lacking gene 4. In this selection, E. coli cells transformed with the pools of plasmids harboring the mutated gene 4 are plated onto plates previously layered with T7Δ4 phage. If the appropriate phage concentration is present on the plate, E. coli cells expressing gene 4 proteins that are defective in supporting T7Δ4 phage will survive. Cells that have functional gene 4 protein expressed will allow T7 phage to propagate, resulting in lysis of the colony. Since too high a concentration of phage can kill all of the cells lacking a functional gene 4 protein, it was first necessary to select an appropriate number of T7Δ4 phage to layer on each plate. As shown in Table I, infection with 1.3 × 108 pfu/plate resulted in lysis of ∼90% of cells regardless of the position mutated, suggesting that lysis of cells occurred even in the absence of a functional gene 4 protein. However, at 1.3 × 107 pfu/plate, a clear distinction in survival among the three libraries was apparent (42% for Ala257, 4% for Pro257, and 66% for Asp263). Since further reduction (1.3 × 106 pfu/plate) of infecting phage did not significantly change the number of surviving cells, we chose 1.3 × 107 pfu/plate for the screening procedure.Table ISelection of gene 4 clones that do not support growth of T7Δ4 The codons for each of the selected amino acids (Ala257, Pro259, and Asp263) were randomly mutated in a cloned gene 4 so as to give three libraries, each containing all possible amino acid replacements in the respective codons. After transformation of plasmids from the library into E. coli DH5α, bacterial cells were spread on plates containing the indicated number of T7Δ4. The numbers of colonies were determined by plating 1/10 of the transformation reactions.Position of random mutationAla257Pro259Asp263No phage7412365T7Δ4 (1.3 × 106 pfu)431046T7Δ4 (1.3 × 107 pfu)31 ± 35 ± 143 ± 2T7Δ4 (1.3 × 108 pfu)725 Open table in a new tab Using the screen described above, individual colonies that survived phage infection were isolated. Lack of ability to support T7Δ4 phage was confirmed by infecting cell cultures derived from individual colonies with T7Δ4. Plasmid DNAs from surviving colonies were purified and subjected to restriction enzyme analysis with SnaBI and AflII and only those that contained the intact coding segment for gene 4 were retained. Initially 151, 20, and 136 colonies survived from plating on the libraries of gene 4 with altered amino acids at Ala257, Pro259, and Asp263, respectively. After restriction enzyme analysis, 124 (Ala257), 8 (Pro259), and 105 (Asp263) plasmid DNAs remained. In order to identify the amino acid replacements that led to gene 4 proteins that could not support T7Δ4 phage growth, the sequence of each plasmid DNA selected in the screen was determined. The results of the DNA sequence analysis are presented in Table II where the amino acid substitutions are tabulated. The striking observation is that only 8 plasmids were identified in the Pro259 library, and none of these had single amino acid substitution at position 259; they consisted of stop codons, deletions, an insertion, or multiple amino acid replacements (Table II). In order to assure that amino acid substitutions were occurring at position 259, we isolated several colonies prior to phage infection and sequenced the DNA to find that Val, Gln, His, Cys, and Gly had replaced Pro. None of these substitutions change the ability to support T7Δ4 (data not shown). We conclude that Pro259 is not a critical amino acid for gene 4 function, because it can be replaced with any amino acid. Although it is difficult to make generalizations regarding the substitutions for Ala257 and Asp263, it does appear that aliphatic residues such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine cannot replace the alanine at position 257, suggesting that the size of the residue at this position is important. Arginine, leucine, valine, and proline were found at a relatively high frequency at position 257. This finding is not unexpected since these amino acids have multiple codons (6, 6, 4, and 4, respectively). Interestingly, serine and glycine, having 6 and 4 codons, respectively, were not substituted at position 257. Since the side chains of these residues are relatively small, it appears likely that the size of the residue at position 257 is critical. Similarly, amino acids coded by multiple codons (alanine, arginine, and proline) were abundant at position 263. In this position, it is noteworthy that asparagine, lacking a negative charge, cannot substitute for aspartic acid. Some amino acid substitutions were not observed presumably because the numbers in the screen are not sufficiently large to be statistically significant.Table IINon-viable amino acid substitutions in linker region of gene 4 protein Plasmids encoding genetically altered gene 4 proteins at residues Ala257, Pro259, and Asp263 that could not support T7Δ4 phage were analyzed by DNA sequence analysis. The DNA sequence encoding the gene 4 sequence from Gly179 to Ser312 was determined, and the identity of the amino acid replacement at positions 257, 259, and 263 was deduced from the codon for those residues.

We chose three gene 4 proteins with the substitutions of leucine, proline, and valine for Ala257 and three with the substitutions of alanine, asparagine, and serine for Asp263. Prior to purification, the ability of these altered gene 4 proteins were examined for their ability to support the growth of T7Δ4 phage and for their effect on the growth of wild-type T7 phage (Table III). None of the altered proteins with single amino acid changes at positions 257 and 263 could support the growth of T7Δ4 phage, and none of the proteins demonstrated a dominant negative effect on the growth of wild-type T7 phage.Table IIIAbility of recombinant gene 4 protein to complement growth of T7 phage Gene 4 proteins containing the indicated amino acid substitution were expressed in E. coli DH5α.

Such a change may be able to form a stronger β-sheet in SPACR. Why this change can cause BCAMD is unknown. SPACRCAN is a proteoglycan with a chondroitin sulfate GAG side chain. Interaction of GAGs with proteins and other factors may be fundamental for IPM structure, formation, and function in vision, including its role in retinal adhesion (7Hollyfield J.G. Varner H.H.

Based on its location, it is conceivable that this matrix in the IPM can at least confine the cylindrical photoreceptor outer segments to preserve nearest neighbor associations and can set the precise alignment of photoreceptors to the optical light path (20Enoch J.M. Laties A.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1971; 10: 959-970Google Scholar). The IPM matrix can also form an adhesion bridge to hold the retina to the outer eye wall. When the adhesion bridge formed by this matrix is disturbed, retinal detachment occurs (7Hollyfield J.G. Varner H.H. Rayborn M.E. Osterfeld A.M. Retina. 1989; 9: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Yao X.Y. Hageman G. Marmor M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1990; 31: 2051-2058PubMed Google Scholar). If left untreated, blindness is the most obvious complication from retinal detachment. Currently the prevalence of retinal detachment is estimated to be 0.3% in general population and higher with patients following cataract surgery, high myopia, and trauma (21Dellone-Larkin G. Dellone C.A. eMedicine. 2001; www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic504.htmGoogle Scholar). Although several techniques are available for repairing a retinal detachment, the degree of recovery varies with individual cases. Thus understanding the mechanisms involved in retinal adhesion could potentially be important in managing retinal detachment. Studies to date suggest that the adhesion between retina and RPE requires the interaction between photoreceptors and RPE. Although no direct cell-cell contacts are involved, the IPM resides in a critical location and is thought to be involved in mediating this interaction (7Hollyfield J.G. Varner H.H. Rayborn M.E. Osterfeld A.M. Retina. 1989; 9: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Enzymatic perturbation of the GAGs of the IPM promotes retinal detachment (8Yao X.Y. Hageman G. Marmor M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1990; 31: 2051-2058PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies show the importance of GAGs in IPM, it remains unknown how GAGs are involved in retinal attachment. Previous studies have demonstrated that the IPM is comprised of both a soluble population of molecules that can be easily removed with aqueous rinses (i.e. interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), a matrix retinoid-binding protein) and a relatively stable complex that resists aqueous extraction (22Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. Landers R.A. Myers K.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 107-110Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SPACR, SPACRCAN, and HA are part of this stable matrix complex. How SPACRCAN interacts with GAG and HA in the IPM matrix complex is the focus of this report. Our target for this analysis is the potential interaction between HA and putative RHAMM (receptor for HA-mediated motility)-type HA binding motifs (HABMs) present in the deduced amino acid sequence of Spacrcan. Spacr will be analyzed in experiments to be conducted later. Since Spacrcan is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, we have also evaluated the possibility that these RHAMM-type HA binding motifs may also bind chondroitin GAGs. In addition, since heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) containing RHAMM-type HABMs express in the retina and may have roles in guiding the neural retina cell growth (i.e. syndecan-3, Refs. 23Berndt C.

To make GST fusion proteins, the amplified fragments were digested with EcoRI and either SmaI or BamHI, purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and ligated to vector pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences) that has been predigested with the corresponding restriction enzymes. The ligated constructs were transformed into DH5α-competent cells (Invitrogen). Colonies were selected for DNA preparation using the RPM kit (Bio101 Inc., La Jolla, CA). The DNA subclones were confirmed by automatic sequencing in a CEQ 2000XL DNA analysis system (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA).

Ampicillin-resistant colonies were selected to inoculate in a 3-ml 2xYT culture for overnight growth at 37 °C. A 1:1000 dilution of the overnight culture was inoculated to a larger culture of 5-500 ml the next day. The culture was kept at 37 °C and 220 rpm. When the OD600 reached 0.6-0.8, 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture. After an additional 1-3 h of culture, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3313 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), centrifuged as above, and either stored at -80 °C or immediately resuspended in ice-cold 1× PBS plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1× bacterial protease inhibitor mixture (P8465, Sigma). The resuspension was sonicated on ice with 60% energy output. After adding Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%, the homogenate was rotated for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was collected. The GST fusion proteins were purified using the bulk and redipack GST purification modules according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Proteins expressed from plasmid pQC43, pQC44, and pQC45 were called prQC43, prQC44, and prQC45. Cetylpyridinium Chloride (CPC) Precipitation—CPC precipitation was performed by preincubating in 100 μl with 2 μg of purified protein and 10 μl of Healon at 1 μg/μl (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris/AcOH, pH 7.3. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, 100 μl of CPC solution containing 2.5% CPC, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris/acetic acid, pH 7.3 was added. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation at room temperature for 20 min at 20,817 × g. The pellets were resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 3 min and chilled on ice immediately before loading to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with the ratio of acrylamide to bis-acrylamide of 37.5 to 1. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Gel Code Blue Stain reagent (Pierce). For Streptomyces hyaluronidase treatment, 2 μl of 0.1 TRU per μl of hyaluronidase (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) in a solution of 0.5 m EDTA, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm iodoacetic acid, and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, was added after the 1-h incubation with HA. The digestion was for 1 h at room temperature before CPC solution was added. Preparation of Biotinylated HA—Fermentation-derived HA (sodium salt, 1500 kDa, Clear Solutions Inc. Stony Brook, NY) was degraded by acid in a similar procedure previously described (26Shu X.Z. Liu Y. Luo Y. Roberts M.C. Prestwich G.D. Biomacromol. 2002; 3: 1304-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) to give a 285-kDa HA. Biotinylation of the HA was according to Ref. 27Pouyani T. Prestwich G.D. Bioconjug. Chem. 1994; 5: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar. Briefly, the HA (87.2 mg) was dissolved in 20 ml of water at room temperature, a 4 °C solution of biotinhydrazide (Pierce) (11.2 mg in 10 ml of dimethylformamide (Sigma) was added. The pH was then adjusted to 4.75, and then EDCI (1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) of 83 mg was added (HA:biotin:EDCI = 1:0.2:2). The mixture was stirred at room temperature (pH 4.75). The reaction was left to proceed overnight, pH adjusted to 7.0 with NaOH, and the product was purified by dialysis, followed by lyophilization. ELISA for Proteins Binding to HA and Heparin—50 μl of biotinylated HA or biotinylated heparin (Celsus Laboratories, Cincinnati, OH) at 10 μg/ml was loaded to a streptavidin-precoated 96-well plate (SAplate, Roche Applied Science) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The plate was washed three times with wash buffer (TBS, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), blocked 3 times for 1 h each with blocking solution Stabil Guard (Surmodics Inc., Eden Prairie, MN), and incubated with serial dilutions of proteins in TBS in triplicate at room temperature for 1 h. After washing three times with the wash buffer, 50 μl of 1:1000 TBS-diluted anti-GST antibody (Sigma) were loaded to the wells for an incubation of 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by three washes with wash buffer, and continuing incubation with antimouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:3000 dilution in TBS, Sigma) at room temperature for 1 h. After three further washes, each well was loaded with 100 μlof3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine substrate (TMB, Sigma). The reaction was continued for 10-15 min until the desired color difference appeared. The reaction was then quenched with 100 μl of 1 m H2SO4. The plate was read at 450 nm. The absorbance reading corresponded to the affinity of proteins to HA or heparin. The reading of negative controls was subtracted from all the sample readings. Competition assays were performed with the highest protein concentration that showed the biggest effects on their GAG binding. 20 μg/ml of competitor GAGs for Figs. 8 and 9, and various concentrations of competitor GAGs for Fig. 5 were added to the protein solution before it was loaded to the wells.Fig. 9Relative GAG binding affinity of the three wild-type recombinant proteins. Wild-type recombinant proteins prQC43, prQC44, and prQC45 were analyzed for binding to biotinylated HA-precoated plates (A) or biotinylated heparin-precoated plates (B) in competition ELISA with various GAGs including HA, heparin, chondroitin sulfate A, and chondroitin sulfate C. The A450 was recorded and corrected with negative controls. Competition effects on binding to HA (A) and heparin (B) were calculated as the relative absorbance to the control reaction without the presence of competitors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5Non-biotinylated HA competes for binding to proteins using biotinylated HA-coated ELISA plates.

Miyagi M. Gu X. Shadrach K.G. West K.A. Sakaguchi H. Kamei M. Hasan A. Yan L. Rayborn M.E. Salomon R.G. Hollyfield J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14682-14687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Expression of Recombinant Proteins Containing RHAMM-type Binding Motifs—We have previously reported that mouse Spacrcan contains five potential RHAMM-type HA binding motifs (29Chen Q. Lee J.W. Nishiyama K. Shadrach K.G. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). To determine if these motifs are functional in HA binding, cDNA fragments containing these HA binding motifs were subcloned into pGEX-2TK vector to make a fusion protein with GST at its N terminus. As shown in Fig. 1A, each clone contains about 100 amino acid residues. Clones prQC43 and prQC44 each contain one HA binding motif. Clone prQC45 contains two HA binding motifs located in tandem with only 2 amino acids separating them. In addition, there is an HA-like binding motif present at the C-terminal end. This motif contains several internal acidic amino acids, which have been suggested to dramatically decrease its HA binding affinity (30Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The motif was included in prQC45 to test its function in HA binding. We will refer to it as a non-functional HA binding motif (NF-HA binding motif). The expressed recombinant protein from each construct was shown in Fig. 2. As predicted based on the nucleotide sequence, recombinant GST fusion proteins prQC44 and prQC45 and their corresponding mutant proteins were about 40 kDa in size. However, prQC43 and each of its corresponding mutant proteins (prQC49, -55, and -57) were calculated to have molecular masses of about 50 kDa, which was about 10 kDa larger than the predicted molecular mass based on mobility in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Such an increase was not caused by subcloning duplicate cDNA fragments into the expression vector, because each subclone was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing using primers flanking the cloning site. Furthermore, the identity of the recombinant protein prQC43 was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis, in which a prQC43-corresponding peptide of YSEELRDPSSALYR was identified. Therefore, it is possible that the apparent higher molecular mass of prQC43 and each of its mutants were caused by post-translational modification or anomalous migration because of the protein charge. As shown in Fig. 1A, prQC43 is a subclone from the mucin-like domain of Spacrcan where many predicted eukaryote O-glycosylation sites were found (29Chen Q. Lee J.W. Nishiyama K. Shadrach K.G. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the predicted eukaryote O-glycosylation site can be functional in bacteria (31Hermann J.L. Delahay R. Gallagher A. Robertson B. Young D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, several immunodominant antigens expressed in Escherichia coli have been found to exhibit molecular masses ranging from 1.6 to 2 times larger than what was predicted mainly because of O-glycosylation (32McBride J.W. Yu X. Walker D.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Chia J. Chang L.Y. Shun C. Chang Y. Chen J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6987-6998Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Since serine and threonine are the main O-glycosylation residues and 23% amino acid residues of the Spacrcan subclone in prQC43 consist of serine and threonine (29Chen Q. Lee J.W. Nishiyama K. Shadrach K.G. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), O-glycosylation may have caused the increase in prQC43 molecular mass. Although the expressed proteins were purified by GST purification modules, several minor bands were visibly present on polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2). Western blot analysis using anti-GST monoclonal antibody revealed smaller molecular mass bands (data not shown). Therefore, those bands may be degradation products of expressed fusion proteins. However, the faint 70-kDa band did not react with anti-GST antibody. Therefore, this probably represented an E. coli protein similar to the product of dnaK (34Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). HA Binds to Recombinant Proteins—To determine whether the recombinant proteins bind HA, CPC precipitation analysis was carried out in which binding of a cationic detergent, CPC, to anionic GAGs, like HA, leads to co-precipitation of proteins interacting with the GAGs. As shown in Fig. 3, each of the three recombinant proteins could be precipitated by CPC after incubating with HA. In the absence of HA, they could not be precipitated. When the HA-recombinant protein complex was digested with hyaluronidase before CPC treatment, precipitation of the recombinant proteins was abolished. This suggests that each of the three recombinant proteins could bind to HA. To determine the relative binding affinity of each protein for HA, we employed an ELISA using biotinylated HA-coated plates. Because a portion of the purified proteins was degraded (Fig. 2) and may not contain HABMs, this portion would not be effective in HA binding. To determine the effective concentration of proteins, we scanned the density of protein bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with a densitometer to obtain the relative density of each band. We then incorporated the effective protein concentration in the ELISA analysis. Fig. 4 shows that binding of proteins prQC43, -44, and -45 to HA was concentration-dependent. The binding increased with increasing protein concentration. In all concentrations tested, more prQC45 was bound to HA than was prQC43 and prQC44. Because the ELISA was performed using biotinylated HA-coated plates, a competition experiment was included to determine if non-biotinylated HA was able to compete the proteins from binding to the HA plates. As shown in Fig. 5, increasing the concentration of competitor HA did lead to a decrease in the binding of all three proteins (prQC43, -44, and -45) to the HA plates. The competition was stronger with prQC44 and prQC45 than prQC43. Mutant Effects on HA Binding—RHAMM-type HA binding motifs consists of B(X7)B, where B is a basic amino acid residue, either Arg or Lys, and X7 corresponds to any seven amino acid residues preferably non-acidic. The presence of basic amino acids in X7 enhances HA binding, while the presence of acidic amino acids reduces the HA binding (30Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). To test whether the predicted RHAMM-type HA binding motifs in mouse Spacrcan bind HA, a series of mutations were introduced to alter the flanking B residues in the HA binding motifs of prQC43, prQC44, and prQC45 to either His or one of the neutral and polar amino acids. As shown in Fig. 1B, a single amino acid mutation for the HA binding motif in prQC43 was made in prQC49 and prQC55. Double amino acid mutations were generated in prQC57. For prQC44, single amino acid mutations were generated in prQC58 and prQC59. For prQC45, multiple amino acid residues were mutated in prQC56. As a result, both HA binding motifs were affected. To distinguish their biological effect, the C-terminal HA binding motif was mutated in prQC60, in which both flanking basic amino acids were mutated. To test the effects of NF-HA binding motif at the C-terminal end, the flanking basic amino acids were mutated in prQC61 (Fig. 1). Using ELISA, the mutant effects on HA binding were analyzed and are shown in Fig. 6, A-C. Fig. 6A shows the effects of the HA binding m"

The binding affinity of GGA1 to the CD-MPR was found to be 2.4-fold higher than that of AP-1. This could regulate the binding of the two proteins to the partly overlapping sorting signals, allowing AP-1 binding to the CD-MPR only when GGA1 is released upon autoinhibition by phosphorylation.

Newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes acquire a mannose 6-phosphate tag on their N-linked oligosaccharides by sequential action of two enzymes in the Golgi and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (3Kornfeld R.

Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31446-31451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mannose 6-phosphate tag acts as a lysosomal targeting signal and is recognized by the CD-MPR in the TGN. Upon binding lysosomal enzymes, CD-MPR is packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles and transported to the acidified endosomes, where the receptor dissociates from the ligand, which is subsequently packaged into lysosomes. However, the receptor is either transported to the plasma membrane, where it is rapidly internalized, or recycled back to the TGN to mediate another round of sorting. The trafficking of the CD-MPR is directed by signals located in its 67-amino-acid cytoplasmic tail.The binding of the CD-MPR cytoplasmic tail to GGA1 (Golgi-localizing, γ-ear-containing, ARF-binding protein-1) mediates its transport out of the TGN (5Puertollano R. Aguilar R.C. Gorshkova I. Crouch R.J. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 2001; 292: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). GGA1 is a monomeric, soluble adaptor with four domains, an N-terminal VHS (Vps27p/Hrs/STAM) domain, a GAT (GGA and TOM1) domain, a connecting hinge segment, and a C-terminal GAE (γ-adaptin ear) domain (6Hirst J.

Watson P.J. Owen D.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The VHS domain of GGA1 binds cargo, which is subsequently targeted to clathrin-coated pits, mediated through an interaction between the GGA1 hinge domain with clathrin and adaptor protein-1 (AP-1) (5Puertollano R.

For the CI-MPR, it was shown that the phosphorylation by casein kinase 2 (CK2) of the serine preceding the aspartate increases its affinity to GGA1 (11Misra S. Puertollano R. Kato Y. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nature. 2002; 415: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the acidic cluster-dileucine motif in the hinge domain of GGA1 requires phosphorylation by CK2 of the serine three residues upstream of the aspartate to facilitate autoinhibition of the VHS domain, by intramolecular or inter-molecular binding (14Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The CD-MPR also contains a serine upstream of the 61DXXLL65, which is phosphorylated by CK2, but its involvement in GGA1 binding has not been investigated so far (15Hemer F. Körner C. Braulke T. J.

Normal as well as impaired lysosomal enzyme delivery was reported for CD-MPR with mutant CK2 phosphorylation sites (17Breuer P. Körner C. Boker C. Herzog A. Pohlmann R. Braulke T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17110-17115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mauxion F.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation of Ser57 was suggested to be required for surface delivery of the CD-MPR either directly from TGN or by inhibiting transport from endosomes to TGN (17Breuer P. Körner C. Boker C. Herzog A. Pohlmann R. Braulke T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). On the other hand, phosphorylation of Ser57 was shown to be essential for AP-1 binding at the TGN for proper sorting to endosomes (19Mauxion F. Le Borgne R. Munier-Lehmann H. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2171-2178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 20Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, Höning et al. (21Höning S. Sosa M. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19884-19890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) showed high affinity binding of AP-1 to non-phosphorylated CD-MPR peptides (residues 1-67 and 49-67). Altogether, it is uncertain whether the phosphorylated serine or the non-phosphorylated serine leads to plasma membrane delivery of the CD-MPR, resulting in mis-sorting of lysosomal enzymes, or whether it has an effect on lysosomal enzyme sorting at all.Before the GGAs and their function of sorting in the TGN were identified, AP-1 was thought to mediate TGN sorting of cargo, such as CD-MPR (21Höning S.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 997-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Since the discovery of the GGAs, the function of AP-1 became less clear, and thereafter, some models accounting for the function of AP-1 were suggested. Fibroblasts deficient in the μ1-subunit of AP-1 accumulated CD-MPR in endosomes and showed reduced retrograde transport in vitro, which led to the conclusion that AP-1 could be involved in retrograde transport from endosomes to the TGN (24Meyer C. Zizioli D. Lausmann S. Eskelinen E.L. Hamann J. Saftig P. von Figura K. Schu P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2193-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 25Medigeshi G.R. Schu P. Traffic. 2003; 4: 802-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the localization of AP-1 to the TGN and in clathrin-coated vesicles originating from the TGN, as well as its increased binding to CD-MPR upon phosphorylation of the receptor, led to a model in which GGA1 recruits cargo, and by phosphorylation of both GGA1 and cargo, GGA1 hands over the cargo to AP-1, which mediates vesicle budding from TGN (10Doray B.

In this study, we show that two glutamates, Glu58 and Glu59, are involved in GGA1 binding in vitro in addition to the known DXXLL motif and that phosphorylation of Ser57 of the CD-MPR had no effect on GGA1 binding. The importance of Glu58 and Glu59 of the CD-MPR for high affinity binding of GGA1 was further confirmed by kinetic studies. Analysis of the interaction of GGA1 with the CD-MPR in vivo demonstrates that the binding was abolished only when residues Glu58, Glu59, Asp61, Leu64, and Leu65 were mutated simultaneously. A comparison of the binding properties of AP-1 and GGA1 to the CD-MPR revealed subtle but essential differences. Most importantly, the CD-MPR has a lower binding affinity to AP-1 than to GGA1. Furthermore, all four glutamates, Glu55, Glu56, Glu58, and Glu59, but not the phosphorylation of Ser57, were involved in AP-1 binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Enzymes used in molecular cloning were obtained from Roche Diagnostics, New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), or Promega (Madison, WI); general chemicals were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland); protease inhibitors were from Sigma; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal calf serum, G418, and LipofectAMINE Plus were from Invitrogen; polyethylenimine, 25 kDa (catalog number 23966) was from Polysciences, Inc.

The monoclonal antibody 22D4 specific for the bovine CD-MPR was generously provided by D. Messner (27Messner D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-CD-MPR antibody was a kind gift from S. Kornfeld (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). The anti-giantin monoclonal antibody was kindly provided by H. P. Hauri.Recombinant DNA—All basic DNA procedures were as described (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). The PCR procedure of Ho et al. (29Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar) was used to generate the MPR-FFWYLL-A, MPR-C30A/C34A, MPR-S57A, MPR-S57D, MPR-Clus-S, MPR-Clus-A, MPR-Clus-D, MPR-E55Q, MPR-E56Q, MPR-E55-Q/E56Q, MPR-E58Q, MPR-E59Q, MPR-E58Q/E59Q, MPR-D61N, MPR-D61N,L64A/L65A, MPR-E58Q/E59Q,D61N,L64A/L65A constructs with pSFFV-MPR (30Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) serving as a template together with MPR-BglII.down (5′-CCGAGATCTCCCACTTAAGCGTGG-3′) and pSFFVneo.up2 (5′-CTGCCATTCATCCGCTTATTATC-3′) as the down- and upstream primers respectively. Appropriate partial complementary pairs of oligonucleotides in which the desired amino acid replacement had been incorporated were chosen as internal primers. The final PCR products were subcloned into pSFFVneo as described (30Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and confirmed by sequencing.The GST-GGA1-A240stop construct was generated by PCR amplification, using Myc-GGA1pFB1 (a generous gift from S. Kornfeld) as a template and subsequent cloning into the BamHI-NotI sites of pGEX-6p3 (Amersham Biosciences). The GFP-GGA1-A240stop construct was generated in two steps as follows. The GGA1-A240stop insert was subcloned into the BamHI-NotI sites of pcDNA3.1+, and the resulting plasmid was then digested with XhoI, and the overhanging 5′ end was filled up with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and subsequently digested with KpnI. The fragment was ligated with KpnI-SmaI-digested pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech). The construct was confirmed by sequencing.Cell Culture and Transfection—A mannose-6-P/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor-deficient mouse L cell line designated D9 (LRec-) was maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were transfected with XbaI-linearized DNA with LipofectAMINE Plus according to the manufacturer's directions. Selection for resistance to neomycin (G418) was carried out using 500 μg/ml G418 as the final concentration. Resistant colonies were picked individually and screened for the expression of bovine CD-MPR by immunoblotting. Clones expressing similar amounts of receptor as compared with ML4 cells, the reference cell line expressing WT bovine CD-MPR (31Johnson K.F. Chan W. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 10010-10014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), were expanded for further study and maintained in selective medium.Mouse L cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant CD-MPR were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates in DMEM to 50% confluency before transient transfection with pEGFP-GGA1-A240stop using polyethylenimine (25 kDa). 2.2 μg of DNA in 75 μl of DMEM was mixed with 8 μl of 1 mg/ml polyethylenimine in 75 μl of DMEM, vortexed, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature following the addition of 1.05 ml of DMEM. The mix was added to the cells in the 6-well plate, and after 24 h, the cells were fixed and prepared for immunofluorescence.In Vitro GST Pull-down Experiment—GST-GGA1-A240stop or GST alone was expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α. A saturated overnight culture was diluted 1:10 in 25 ml of growth medium and incubated at 37 °C until A600 was 0.6-0.8 before induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed by sonication in 2 ml of pull-down buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2) containing a 1:500 dilution of a protease inhibitor cocktail (5 mg/ml benzamidine and 1 mg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, antipain, and chymostatin in 40% dimethyl sulfoxide, 60% ethanol) (PIC) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (40 μg/ml in ethanol). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall GSA centrifuge. The supernatant was incubated for 30 min at room temperature on a rotating shaker with 400 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, which were prewashed three times with pull-down buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin in a silanized Eppendorf tube. The beads with GST or GST-GGA1-A240stop were washed three times and then resuspended in 1 ml of pull-down buffer containing PIC and PMSF, the amount for 10 assays.Extracts from mouse L cells expressing wild-type or mutant CD-MPR constructs were prepared from cells grown on 15-cm Falcon tissue culture dishes in the following way. Confluent 15-cm dishes of cells were put on ice and washed once with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS and scraped in 5 ml of pull-down buffer containing PIC and PMSF. The cells were pelleted at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C in a Heraeus centrifuge and resuspended in 1 ml of pull-down buffer containing PIC and PMSF. The cells were homogenized in a ball-bearing homogenizer of 16-μm clearance using 12 strokes on ice and centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the resulting post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was measured using a protein assay (Bio-Rad). The appropriate amounts of PNS from each of the mutant cell lines and wild-type cell line yielding the same amount of CD-MPR were determined by Western blotting with anti-CD-MPR monoclonal antibody 22D4 followed by densitometric scanning and quantification using Image-QuaNT 5.0 software (Amersham Biosciences). These PNS samples adjusted for expression levels were used for the assay.100 μl of the resuspended beads bound with either GST or GSTGGA1-A240stop were incubated with 100 μg of PNS from the wild-type cell line or an equivalent amount of PNS from mutant cell lines adjusted for the expression level as described above in 300 μl of pull-down buffer containing PIC and PMSF and 0.1% Triton X-100 in a silanized Eppendorf tube for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating shaker. Beads were spun at 2500 rpm for 2 min at room temperature in an Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant was collected and stored. The beads were washed three times with pull-down buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. 40 μl of non-reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer (94 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 3% SDS, 15% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue) was added to the beads, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-CD-MPR monoclonal antibody 22D4. An aliquot of each of the supernatants was also analyzed similarly to determine the amount of unbound receptor.Purification of GST-GGA1-A240stop—GST-GGA1-A240stop was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads as described above. The procedure was scaled up to 400 ml of bacterial overnight culture, which was diluted to 4 liters. The volumes of the following steps were adjusted as follows; the bacteria were sonicated in 90 ml of pull-down buffer, and the amount of glutathione-Sepharose 4B was 1 ml. After washing the beads three times with pull-down buffer, the GST fusion protein was eluted by incubating the beads with 1 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm glutathione reduced, 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing PIC and PMSF for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were spun down at 700 × g for 2 min, the supernatant containing the GST-GGA1-A240 protein was dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.7, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol), GST-GGA1-A240 was recovered, and the concentration was measured using a protein assay.Analysis of Protein-Protein Interaction by SPR—To monitor the binding of AP-1 and GGA1 to the CD-MPR C-terminal domain, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the tail residues 49-67 and mutants within this peptide were immobilized on a CM5 surface of a BIAcore 3000 biosensor. AP-1 was purified from pig brain using published methods (21Höning S. Sosa M. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19884-19890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and GGA1 was purified as a GST fusion protein. Both proteins were used at concentrations ranging from 25 to 500 nm in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.7, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Binding and dissociation were recorded for 2 min. A short pulse injection (5 s) of 50 mm NaOH was then used to remove bound material from the sensor surface. The rate constants were determined using the software supplied by the manufacturer assuming a single binding site for AP-1 and GGA1.SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—The proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide minigel by using the Laemmli system (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes according to the method of Towbin et al. (33Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44707) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked with 3% non-fat dry milk powder (Sano Lait, Coop, Switzerland) in PBS. The blot was subsequently incubated with monoclonal antibody 22D4 (diluted 1:500 in PBS-3% powdered milk) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (diluted 1:2000 in PBS-3% powdered milk). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system according to the manufacturer's directions.Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on coverslips and, if mentioned, transiently transfected with pEGFP-GGA1-A240stop. After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, pH 8.3, for 20 min followed by four washes with 20 mm glycine in PBS. The cells were permeabilized in saponin buffer (0.1% saponin, 20 mm glycine in PBS) for 20 min. All the following steps were performed in saponin buffer. Cells were incubated with anti-CDMPR monoclonal antibody 22D4 (1:500) or anti-giantin monoclonal antibody (1:250) for 30 min and washed four times followed by the incubation with goat anti-mouse Alexa 568 antibody. The non-transfected cells were incubated with anti-CD-MPR polyclonal antibody followed by an incubation with goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 antibody. The coverslips were washed four times and mounted on glass slides with ProLong Antifade for viewing with a Leica SP2 AOBS UV confocal laser-scanning microscope. Serial sections in the z-axis through the entire cells were taken, and the resulting stacks of images were analyzed using the Imaris program (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). The quantification of the fluorescence was performed using the Leica Confocal Software as follows. A region of interest was set around the Golgi/TGN area, and the amount of fluorescence was determined for the green (GGA1 or giantin) and the red (CD-MPR) channel by the program. A second region of interest was laid around the entire cell, and the fluorescence was measured again for both channels. Using these values, the percentage of fluorescence in the Golgi/TGN area was calculated relative to the total staining.RESULTSAcidic Cluster of the CK2 Site of CD-MPR but Not Phosphorylation Is Essential for GGA1 Binding—To analyze the involvement of the CK2 phosphorylation site of the CD-MPR in GGA1 binding, several mutants of the bovine CD-MPR were constructed and stably transfected into mouse L cells. We used full-length CD-MPR, expressed in mammalian cells to allow the formation of the correct posttranslational modification and the three-dimensional structure, which provided physiological conditions for protein-protein interactions. To differentiate between the phosphorylation and the acidic CK2 site, several point mutations of the CD-MPR sequence were created (Fig. 1A). The Ser57 was replaced either by an alanine to disable phosphorylation or by an aspartate to disable phosphorylation, but mimicking the negative charge of phosphorylation. In addition to the three variants at position 57, the cluster of four glutamates Glu55-Glu59 of the CK2 site was mutated to glutamines, generating the cluster-minus mutants (MPR-Clus-S, MPR-Clus-A, and MPR-Clus-D). Apart from the CK2 site mutants, two additional mutants were tested for GGA1 binding, the palmitoylation-deficient (MPR-C30A/C34A) mutant and the internalization-deficient (MPR-FFWYLL-A) mutant, lacking the dileucine motif, which is part of the known GGA1 binding motif (61DXXLL65) (5Puertollano R.

The GGA1 binding assay was performed with wild-type or mutant CD-MPR, in PNS from stably transfected cells and a truncated form of GGA1 fused to GST (GST-GGA1-A240stop), since the full-length GGA1 has been shown to be autoinhibitory for binding to the receptor (14Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). GST-GGA1-A240stop comprises the VHS domain for cargo binding and a larger part of the GAT domain for the interaction with ARF. In the GST pull-down assay, we could detect strong binding of the wild-type MPR to the GGA1 fragment and no binding of the FFWYLL-A mutant, as expected (Fig. 1B), with the PNS containing an equal amount of the CD-MPR protein (Fig. 1C). The specificity of the assay was confirmed by the fact that the CD-MPR"

A sharp margin of interference effects was observed, whereby +5 and -2 BP dG modifications were well tolerated, but +4, +3, and -1 BP dG adducts were severely deleterious. The stereoselective effects at the -1 nucleoside (the R diastereomer interfered, whereas the S diastereomer did not) delineated at high resolution the downstream border of the minor groove interface (25Tian L.

It was inferred that BP dG inhibition of transesterification is likely caused by steric exclusion of essential constituents of the topoisomerase from the DNA minor groove. PAH diol epoxide-DNA adducts have also been exploited to probe the effects of position-specific intercalation, by introducing trans-opened 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxide adducts of BP at the exocyclic N6-amino group of deoxyadenosine (dA) positions within the nonscissile strand (26Yakovleva L.

The R and S BP dA adducts intercalate from the major groove on the 5′ and 3′ sides of the modified base, respectively, and perturb local base stacking (29Volk D.E. Rice J.S. Luxon B.A. Yeh H.J.C.

R and S BP dA modifications at +1A reduced the transesterification rate by a factor of 700 to 1000 without affecting the yield of the covalent topoisomerase-DNA complex. BP dA modifications at +2A reduced the extent of transesterification and elicited rate decrements of 200-fold and 7000-fold for the S and R diastereomers, respectively (26Yakovleva L. Tian L. Sayer J.M. Kalena G.P. Kroth H. Jerina D.M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42170-42177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast, BP dA adducts at the -2 position had no effect on the extent of the reaction and relatively little impact on the rate of cleavage. The BP dA interference effects demarcated the -1 base pair as the “downstream” margin of the functional interface between DNA and vaccinia topoisomerase that can be affected significantly by BP intercalation. The “upstream” margin remained undefined because the effects of intercalating PAH adducts at the guanine positions of the cleavage target site were not tested. Here we extend the use of defined PAH diol epoxide-DNA adducts to probe the effects of position-specific intercalation by benzo[c]phenanthrene (BcPh) at all purines of the topoisomerase target sequence. BcPh exemplifies the sterically hindered, nonplanar “fjord-region” class of PAHs. BcPh has been studied extensively in light of the highly tumorigenic and mutagenic properties of metabolically activated BcPh diol epoxides, which react at the benzylic C1 position by trans addition of guanine N2 and adenine N6 in DNA to form the covalent trans 1S and 1R BcPh dG and BcPh dA adducts depicted in Fig. 1. Structures of duplex DNAs containing single BcPh dG adducts have established that the aromatic ring systems intercalate from the minor groove on opposite sides of the modified dG base depending on their stereochemical configuration (34Lin C.H. Huang X. Kolbanovskii A. Hingerty B.E. Amin S. Broyde S. Geacintov N.E. Patel D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1059-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The S diastereomer intercalates on the 5′ side of the dG, whereas the R diastereomer intercalates on the 3′ side (Fig. 2). Structures of DNAs containing single BcPh dA adducts show that the hydrocarbon intercalates from the major groove, such that the S diastereomer is on the 3′ side of the modified dA base and the R diastereomer is on the 5′ side (Fig. 2; Refs. 35Cosman M. Fiala R. Hingerty B.E. Laryea A. Lee H. Harvey R.G. Amin S. Geacintov N.E. Broyde S. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12488-12497Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar and 36Cosman M. Laryea A.

The intercalated BcPh dG and BcPh dA adducts do not disrupt base pairing, but they do cause a buckling of the modified base pair and the unmodified base pair flanking the hydrocarbon (Fig. 2). An attractive feature of BcPh adducts with respect to studies of vaccinia topoisomerase is that they provide structural probes for intercalative interference effects at all of the purine bases of the nonscissile strand of the 5′-CCCTT/3′-GGGAA target site and for effects of intercalation at positions immediately 3′ of the scissile phosphodiester.Fig. 2NMR structures of R and SBcPh dG and dA adducts in duplex DNA. The structures (Ref. 34Lin C.H. Huang X. Kolbanovskii A. Hingerty B.E. Amin S. Broyde S. Geacintov N.E. Patel D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1059-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) of the indicated BcPh diol epoxide adducts are illustrated looking into the minor groove. The intercalated hydrocarbon moiety is colored yellow; the modified base pair is colored cyan.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We report here that transesterification by vaccinia topoisomerase was suppressed by BcPh intercalation between the +4/+3, +3/+2, +2/+1, +1/-1, and -1/-2 base pairs, but intercalation between the +6/+5, +5/+4, and -2/-3 base pairs had little effect. These new findings demarcate upstream and downstream margins of the interface between DNA and vaccinia topoisomerase. In light of these results, we tested the effects of the anthracycline drug nogalamycin, which intercalates preferentially at 5′-TG dinucleotides in duplex DNA (37Smith C.K. Brannigan J.A. Moore M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 237-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38Williams H.E.L. Searle M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 699-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 39Zhang X. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9451-9466Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We find that nogalamycin inhibits the single-turnover DNA cleavage reaction of vaccinia topoisomerase and that its potency is higher when the cleavage target site is 5′-CCCTT↓G versus 5′-CCCTT↓A. We surmise that nogalamycin can inhibit the vaccinia enzyme by intercalating between the +1 and -1 base pairs. Synthesis of BcPh Diol Epoxide-adducted Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotide 18-mers containing trans-opened S and R BcPh diol epoxide adducts (Fig. 1) were synthesized from appropriately protected 5′-O-dimethoxytrityl-3′-phosphoramidites (BcPh dA and BcPh dG phosphoramidites) as described (40Kroth H. Yagi H. Sayer J.M. Kumar S. Jerina D.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 708-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides containing BcPh dG were synthesized using purified S and R diastereomers of the BcPh dG phosphoramidites (41Yagi H. Ramesha A.R. Kalena G. Sayer J.M. Kumar S. Jerina D.M. J. Org. Chem. 2002; 67: 6678-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). BcPh dA adducts were incorporated as their mixed S/R diastereomers (42Ilankumaran P. Pannell L.K. Gebreselassie P. Pilcher A.S. Yagi H. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 1330-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The resulting S and R BcPh dA-adducted oligonucleotides were purified and resolved by HPLC. Absolute configurations of the BcPh dA adducts were assigned to the separated oligonucleotides after enzymatic hydrolysis to form the nucleoside adducts, which were identified by their CD spectra (43Sayer J.M. Chadha A. Agarwal S.K. Yeh H.J.C. Yagi H. Jerina D.M. J. Org. Chem. 1991; 56: 20-29Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 44Agarwal S.K. Sayer J.M. Yeh H.J.C. Pannell L.K. Hilton B.D. Pigott M.A. Dipple A. Yagi H. Jerina D.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 2497-2504Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Details of the high performance liquid chromatography purification of the adducted oligonucleotides are provided in Supplemental Table S1. The compositions of the oligonucleotides were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry analysis. DNA Cleavage Substrates—The CCCTT-containing scissile strands were 5′ 32P-labeled by enzymatic phosphorylation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled oligonucleotides were gel-purified and hybridized to standard or modified nonscissile strand oligonucleotides at a 1:4 molar ratio of scissile:nonscissile strand. Annealing reaction mixtures containing 0.2 m NaCl and oligonucleotides as specified were heated to 80 °C and then slow-cooled to 22 °C. The hybridized DNAs were stored at 4 °C. The structures of the annealed duplexes and the sequences of the component strands are depicted in the figures. Vaccinia Topoisomerase—Recombinant vaccinia topoisomerase was produced in Escherichia coli BL21 by infection with bacteriophage λCE6 (2Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then purified to apparent homogeneity from the soluble bacterial lysate by phosphocellulose and Source S-15 chromatography steps. Protein concentration was determined by using the dye-binding method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Drugs—Nogalamycin was obtained from the Open Chemical Repository, Developmental Therapeutics Program, National Cancer Institute. Nogamycin was obtained from Amersham Biosciences, courtesy of Dr. Paul Aristoff. The drugs were dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 10 mm. The stock solutions were stored at -20 °C and diluted freshly in Me2SO for each experiment to attain the desired concentrations. Single-turnover DNA Cleavage—Reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 pmol of CCCTT-containing DNA and 75 or 150 ng (2 or 4 pmol) of vaccinia topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn at the times specified and quenched immediately with SDS (1% final concentration). The products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. Free DNA migrated near the dye front. Covalent complex formation was revealed by transfer of radiolabeled DNA to the topoisomerase. The extent of covalent complex formation was quantified by scanning the dried gel using a Fujifilm BAS2500 imager. A plot of the percentage of input DNA cleaved versus time established the end point values for cleavage. The data were then normalized to the end point values (defined as 100%), and the cleavage rate constants (kcl) were calculated by fitting the normalized data to the equation, 100 -%cleavage(norm) = 100e-kt. Single-turnover Religation by the Suicide Intermediate—Cleavage reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 0.3 pmol of the 18-mer/30-mer DNA (5′ 32P-labeled on the 18-mer scissile strand and containing a G:C base pair at position -1) and 2 pmol of topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C for 30 s to form the suicide intermediate. The reaction mixtures were adjusted to 10% Me2SO and 0, 5, 10, or 20 μm nogalamycin and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Religation was initiated by the simultaneous addition of NaCl to 0.5 m and a 5′ hydroxyl-terminated 18-mer acceptor strand d(GTTCCGATAGTGACTACA) to a concentration of 15 pmol/22 μl (i.e. a 50-fold molar excess over the input DNA substrate). The reaction was quenched after 15 s by adding an equal volume of buffer containing 2% SDS, 76% formamide, and 20 mm EDTA. The samples were heat-denatured and then analyzed by electrophoresis through a 17% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE (90 mM Tris/64.6 mM boric acid/2.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.3). Religation of the covalently bound 12-mer strand to the 18-mer acceptor DNA will yield a5′ 32P-labeled 30-mer strand transfer product. The extent of religation is expressed as the percent of the input labeled 18-mer strand recovered as 30-mer. Position-specific BcPh Interference Effects on DNA Transesterification—Oligodeoxynucleotide 18-mers containing a single C-1 S or R BcPh diol epoxide adduct at purine positions of the nonscissile strand sequence 3′-G+5G+4G+3A+2A+1T-1A-2 were synthesized and then annealed to a 5′ 32P-labeled 34-mer scissile strand to form suicide cleavage substrates for vaccinia topoisomerase (Fig. 3). The cleavage transesterification reaction results in covalent attachment of the 32P-labeled 12-mer 5′-pCGTGTCGCCCTTp to the enzyme via Tyr-274. The unlabeled 22-mer 5′-OH-leaving strand dissociates spontaneously from the protein-DNA complex. Loss of the leaving strand drives the reaction toward the covalent state, so that the reaction can be treated kinetically as a first-order unidirectional process. The reaction of excess topoisomerase with the unmodified control substrate attained an end point at which 90% of the DNA was converted to covalent topoisomerase-DNA complex; the reaction was complete within 20 s. The extent of transesterification after 5 s was 55% of the end point value. From this datum, we calculated a single-turnover cleavage rate constant (kcl) of 0.27 s-1 (Fig. 3). We found that the S and R BcPh modifications at position +5G and the R BcPh modification at +4G slowed the transesterification rate to 0.13, 0.07, and 0.07 s-1, respectively, without significantly affecting the yield of covalently bound DNA at the reaction end point (61–65%). The kobs for cleavage of these BcPh dG-modified substrates did not increase when the concentration of topoisomerase in the reaction mixture was varied over a 4-fold range (not shown), indicating that the modestly slowed cleavage rates (2- to 4-fold compared with the unmodified control DNA) were not caused by slow noncovalent binding of topoisomerase to these substrates. In contrast, the S BcPh adduct at +4G, the R and S BcPh adducts at +3G, and the S and R adducts at +2A virtually abolished the transesterification reaction. The extents of DNA cleavage after a 24-h reaction in enzyme excess were in the range of 1–4% of the input suicide substrate (Fig. 3). Although the accumulation of the topoisomerase-DNA complex on these modified DNAs was time-dependent, the reaction clearly did not attain a useful end point for the purpose of calculating a cleavage rate constant. The end point did not increase when the concentration of topoisomerase was doubled, implying that the reaction was not limited by the noncovalent binding step. Rather, we surmise that the majority of the topoisomerase binding events on the +4S, +3R, and +3S BcPh dG and +2S and +2R BcPh dA substrates were nonproductive with respect to transesterification, and that there was not a free equilibrium between productive and nonproductive binding modes (at least not within the 24-h period that the reactions were monitored). The S and R BcPh dA modifications at +1A reduced kcl to 0.0001 and 0.0006 s-1, respectively, without significantly affecting the end point (67–71% cleavage). Thus, +1 BcPh dA adducts elicited rate decrements of 2700-fold and 450-fold for the S and R diastereomers, respectively. Note that the interference effect was greater when the +1 BcPh dA adduct was intercalated on the 3′ side of the modified adenine base facing away from the scissile phosphodiester (Fig. 3). The BcPh dA adducts at the -2 position also displayed a strong orientation bias with respect to rate effects. The S diastereomer, which faces toward the scissile phosphodiester, reduced the cleavage rate constant to 0.003 s-1, a 90-fold decrement compared with the unmodified control DNA, whereas the R diastereomer at -2 had little impact on the rate (0.12 s-1). Neither of the -2 BcPh dA adducts affected the cleavage reaction end point. To address whether BcPh substitutions altered the site of cleavage within the 34-mer scissile strand, the products of the cleavage reactions with unmodified DNA, and the +5R, +5S, +4R, +1R, -2S, and -2R BcPh diol epoxide-modified DNAs were digested with proteinase K in the presence of SDS to remove the covalently linked topoisomerase, and the radiolabeled DNA reaction products were then analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Reaction of topoisomerase with the unmodified control substrate results in the appearance of a cluster of radiolabeled species migrating faster than the input 32P-labeled 34-mer strand, which consists of the 12-mer 5′-pCGTGTCGCCCTTp linked to one or more amino acids of the topoisomerase. The same cluster was produced by proteinase K digestion of the covalent complex formed by reaction of topoisomerase with the BcPh dA and BcPh dG substrates (data not shown). Thus, the site of covalent complex formation was unchanged by the BcPh modifications. Any shift in the cleavage site, and hence the size of the covalently bound oligonucleotide, would have been readily detected by an altered mobility of the array of labeled oligonucleotide-peptide complexes. Effects of Nogalamycin on DNA Transesterification by Vaccinia Topoisomerase—The exquisite sensitivity of vaccinia topoisomerase to position-specific intercalators has implications for the discovery of poxvirus-specific topoisomerase inhibitors and/or poisons as candidate antipoxviral drugs. DNA intercalating agents have been widely studied as inhibitors of other DNA topoisomerases; indeed, intercalating drugs that target topoisomerase II are mainstays of cancer chemotherapy. Existing compounds that display some activity against microbial or eukaryotic cellular topoisomerases are a reasonable starting point for screening for inhibition or poisoning of the poxvirus topoisomerase. The anthracycline drug nogalamycin intercalates in duplex DNA with sequence selectivity for 5′ pyrimidine-purine dinucleotides 5′-TG and 5′-CG (45Fox K.R. Waring M.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4349-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Nogalamycin consists of a core 4-ring chromophore with a nogalose sugar and a methyl ester attached to the A ring and a bicyclic aminoglucose sugar fused to the D ring (Fig. 4). X-ray and NMR structures of drug-DNA complexes have shown that the dumbbell-shaped nogalamycin molecule intercalates with its nogalose sugar in the minor groove and its aminoglucose sugar in the major groove (37Smith C.K.
