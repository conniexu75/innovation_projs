https://openalex.org/W2096401612,"Anti-inflammatory strategies are proposed to have beneficial effects in Alzheimer's disease. To explore how anti-inflammatory cytokine signaling affects Aβ pathology, we investigated the effects of adeno-associated virus (AAV2/1)-mediated expression of Interleukin (IL)-10 in the brains of APP transgenic mouse models. IL-10 expression resulted in increased Aβ accumulation and impaired memory in APP mice. A focused transcriptome analysis revealed changes consistent with enhanced IL-10 signaling and increased ApoE expression in IL-10-expressing APP mice. ApoE protein was selectively increased in the plaque-associated insoluble cellular fraction, likely because of direct interaction with aggregated Aβ in the IL-10-expressing APP mice. Ex vivo studies also show that IL-10 and ApoE can individually impair glial Aβ phagocytosis. Our observations that IL-10 has an unexpected negative effect on Aβ proteostasis and cognition in APP mouse models demonstrate the complex interplay between innate immunity and proteostasis in neurodegenerative diseases, an interaction we call immunoproteostasis."

Human genetic evidence suggests involvement of the cardinal anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL10). We crossed the APP/PS1 mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis with a mouse deficient in Il10 (APP/PS1+Il10−/−). Quantitative in silico 3D modeling revealed activated Aβ phagocytic microglia in APP/PS1+Il10−/− mice that restricted cerebral amyloidosis. Genome-wide RNA sequencing of APP/PS1+Il10−/− brains showed selective modulation of innate immune genes that drive neuroinflammation. Il10 deficiency preserved synaptic integrity and mitigated cognitive disturbance in APP/PS1 mice. In vitro knockdown of microglial Il10-Stat3 signaling endorsed Aβ phagocytosis, while exogenous IL-10 had the converse effect. Il10 deficiency also partially overcame inhibition of microglial Aβ uptake by human Apolipoprotein E. Finally, the IL-10 signaling pathway was abnormally elevated in AD patient brains. Our results suggest that “rebalancing” innate immunity by blocking the IL-10 anti-inflammatory response may be therapeutically relevant for AD.

Our results suggest that “rebalancing” innate immunity by blocking the IL-10 anti-inflammatory response may be therapeutically relevant for AD. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by a triad of pathological features: extracellular amyloid deposits predominantly composed of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) chiefly comprised of abnormally folded tau protein, and gliosis consisting of reactive microglia and astrocytes surrounding β-amyloid plaques. During the past century, intense focus has been directed toward studying production, aggregation, and spreading of β-amyloid plaques and subsequent neurodegeneration (Mucke and Selkoe, 2012Mucke L. Selkoe D.J. Neurotoxicity of amyloid β-protein: synaptic and network dysfunction.Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med. 2012; 2: a006338Crossref Scopus (731) Google Scholar). These studies have led to the conclusion that AD pathology is driven by an imbalance between Aβ production and clearance. Indeed, autosomal-dominant forms of familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) are principally linked to mutations affecting β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) or Presenilin 1 (PS1) function (De Strooper et al., 2012De Strooper B. Iwatsubo T. Wolfe M.S. Presenilins and γ-secretase: structure, function, and role in Alzheimer Disease.Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med. 2012; 2: a006304Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar), leading to amyloidogenic processing of β-APP and accumulation of cerebral amyloid deposits. Nonetheless, the vast majority of patients have the sporadic form of the disease, which likely arises from a combination of poorly defined genetic and environmental risk factors. These factors do not necessarily affect β-APP proteolysis, and it has instead been suggested that dysregulated Aβ clearance—rather than production—is the etiologic driving force in sporadic AD (Mawuenyega et al., 2010Mawuenyega K.G. Sigurdson W. Ovod V. Munsell L. Kasten T. Morris J.C. Yarasheski K.E. Bateman R.J. Decreased clearance of CNS beta-amyloid in Alzheimer’s disease.Science. 2010; 330: 1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). As the resident macrophages of the CNS, microglia are chiefly responsible for phagocytosis and clearance of cellular detritus. Furthermore, numerous studies have validated the ability of microglia to phagocytose Aβ peptides (Grathwohl et al., 2009Grathwohl S.A. Kälin R.E. Bolmont T. Prokop S. Winkelmann G. Kaeser S.A.

However, mounting evidence suggests that microglia are dysfunctional in the AD brain (Lopes et al., 2008Lopes K.O. Sparks D.L. Streit W.J.

While prolonged activation of brain inflammatory processes coordinated by the cerebral innate immune system is now accepted as an AD etiologic event (Wyss-Coray and Mucke, 2002Wyss-Coray T. Mucke L. Inflammation in neurodegenerative disease—a double-edged sword.Neuron. 2002; 35: 419-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar), the role of anti-inflammatory pathways in Aβ clearance and AD pathobiology has been largely overlooked. Inflammatory responses are kept under control by two key immunoregulatory cytokines: transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) (Li and Flavell, 2008Li M.O. Flavell R.A.

Our laboratory has previously shown that blockade of anti-inflammatory TGF-β-Smad 2/3 signaling in innate immune cells mitigates cerebral amyloidosis and behavioral deficits in the Tg2576 mouse model (Town et al., 2008Town T. Laouar Y. Pittenger C. Mori T. Szekely C.A. Tan J. Duman R.S. Flavell R.A. Blocking TGF-beta-Smad2/3 innate immune signaling mitigates Alzheimer-like pathology.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the innate immune system can be harnessed to clear Aβ in the context of anti-inflammatory signaling inhibition. Remarkably, cerebral levels of IL-10 were increased in this scenario, in line with the elevated IL-10 signaling observed in reactive glia neighboring β-amyloid plaques in aged Tg2576 mice (Apelt and Schliebs, 2001Apelt J. Schliebs R.

Also, a functional polymorphism within the Il10 gene has been linked to increased risk of AD in some (Arosio et al., 2004Arosio B. Trabattoni D. Galimberti L. Bucciarelli P. Fasano F. Calabresi C.

IL-10 signaling induced by binding of IL-10 homodimer to its cognate receptor (IL-10R) leads to phosphorylation of associated Janus kinase 1 (Jak1) and downstream phosphorylation and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Phosphorylated STAT3 translocates to the nucleus, where it regulates transcription of downstream cytokines and inflammatory genes including SOCS3 (Murray, 2006Murray P.J. Understanding and exploiting the endogenous interleukin-10/STAT3-mediated anti-inflammatory response.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2006; 6: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To investigate putative involvement of the IL-10 pathway in AD-like pathology, we crossed the Tg(APPswe, PS1ΔE9) mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis with animals deficient in Il10. Genetic disruption of Il10 licensed Aβ phagocytosis by activated microglia and reduced Aβ load in APP/PS1 mouse brains. Transcriptome analysis of brains from APP/PS1+Il10−/− mice by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) revealed modulation of the inflammatory milieu, including select inflammatory and microglial regulatory genes. Finally, Il10 deficiency partially rescued synaptic toxicity and behavioral impairment driven by the APP/PS1 transgenes. To assess the role of Il10 in AD-like pathology, we bred Il10−/− mice (Kühn et al., 1993Kühn R. Löhler J. Rennick D. Rajewsky K. Müller W. Interleukin-10-deficient mice develop chronic enterocolitis.Cell. 1993; 75: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3647) Google Scholar) to Tg(APPswe,PSEN1ΔE9) animals (referred as APP/PS1 mice in the present study) (Jankowsky et al., 2001Jankowsky J.L.

Genet. 2004; 13: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). APP/PS1+Il10−/− and APP/PS1+Il10+/− mice were born at Mendelian ratios and exhibited no anatomical defects or premature death compared to APP/PS1+Il10+/+ mice. IL-10 levels measured in the plasma of 12-month-old mice followed an Il10 allele-dependent expression pattern (pg of IL-10/ml of plasma: APP/PS1+Il10+/+, 19.0 ± 1.1 [n = 6], APP/PS1+Il10+/− [n = 4], 10.8 ± 2.1∗∗; APP/PS1+Il10−/−, 0.20 ± 0.04∗∗∗ [n = 4]; ∗∗p > 0.01, ∗∗∗p > 0.001 compared to APP/PS1+Il10+/+ mice by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test). At 12 to 13 months of age, APP/PS1+Il10−/− mice manifested significantly reduced amyloid deposition in cingulate cortex (CC), entorhinal cortex (EC), and hippocampus (HC) as measured by thioflavin S histochemistry (Figures 1A and 1B ; reductions versus APP/PS1+Il10+/+ mice: CC, 74%; EC, 78%; HC, 67%, ∗∗∗p < 0.001; by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test). Furthermore, 4G8+ β-amyloid plaques were also significantly reduced in APP/PS1+Il10−/− compared to APP/PS1+Il10+/+ animals (Figure 1C; CC, 67%; EC, 50%; HC, 70%, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001; one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test). Aβ plaque morphometry was analyzed by blindly assigning plaques to one of three mutually exclusive categories based on maximum diameter. Surprisingly, APP/PS1+Il10−/− mice had modest but statistically significant increases in abundance of small (<25 μm) plaques in the CC and EC versus APP/PS1+Il10+/+ animals (Figure S1A, ∗p < 0.05 by one-way ANOVA and Fisher's post hoc test). Yet, numbers of medium- (25–50 μm) and large-sized (>50 μm) plaques were significantly reduced by 48%–74% in the CC, and this effect trended toward significance in the EC and HC (Figures S1B and S1C, ∗p < 0.05; by one-way ANOVA and Fisher’s post hoc test). In addition to Aβ plaques in brain parenchyma, 86% of AD patients deposit Aβ in cerebral blood vessels, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (Ellis et al., 1996Ellis R.J. Olichney J.M. Thal L.J. Mirra S.S. Morris J.C. Beekly D. Heyman A.

Liu C.C. Shinohara M. Li J. Bu G. LRP1 in brain vascular smooth muscle cells mediates local clearance of Alzheimer’s amyloid-β.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 16458-16465Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). APP/PS1 mice also develop CAA, and this pathology was significantly reduced by 46%–68% in EC and HC (and trended toward significance in CC) in APP/PS1+Il10−/− versus APP/PS1+Il10+/+ mice (Figure 1D, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01; by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test). Interestingly, no evidence for Il10 heterozygous advantage was found for Aβ deposits in brain parenchyma or cerebral vessels (Figures 1A–1D and S1, p > 0.05). Biochemical analysis revealed striking reductions in both Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 abundance in brains of APP/PS1+Il10−/− compared to APP/PS1+Il10+/+ mice. In the detergent-soluble fraction, Aβ1–40 was reduced by 63% and Aβ1–42 by 70% (Figures 1E and 1F, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01; by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test). Additionally, after re-extraction of the detergent-insoluble pellet in the chaotropic agent, guanidine-HCl, Aβ1–40 was lowered by 79% and Aβ1–42, by 85% in APP/PS1+Il10−/− versus APP/PS1+Il10+/+ mice (Figures 1G and 1H, ∗p < 0.05; by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test). Interestingly, detergent-soluble cerebral Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 abundance was decreased by 35%–42% in APP/PS1+Il10+/− mice, although this trend did not reach statistical significance (Figures 1E and 1F, p > 0.05; by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test). To rule out the possibility of an effect on cerebral amyloidosis due to altered APPSwe or PS1ΔE9 transgene expression, western blot and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qPCR) analyses were performed on protein and RNA extracted from frontal cortex of all three groups of mice. No between-groups differences were found on PS1 or APP protein or mRNA levels (Figures 1I–1K). To determine if Il10 deficiency altered APP metabolism, amyloidogenic C99 fragments were detected in frontal cortex brain extracts (n = 5 to 6 for each mouse group) by western blot but remained unmodified (quantitation of C99 band intensity normalized to holo-APP and β-actin: APP/PS1+Il10+/+, 99.5 ± 7.8; APP/PS1+Il10+/−, 96.8 ± 7.3; APP/PS1+Il10−/−, 87.9 ± 5.9, p > 0.05; by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test). Finally, to address the possibility of Aβ peptide efflux from brain to blood, we assayed plasma levels of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 but did not detect significant differences (pg of Aβ1–40/ml of plasma: APP/PS1+Il10+/+, 594.3 ± 92.8; APP/PS1+Il10+/−, 649.4 ± 90.3; APP/PS1+Il10−/−, 752.3 ± 55.4; pg of Aβ1–42/mL of plasma: APP/PS1+Il10+/+, 220.2 ± 60.9; APP/PS1+Il10+/−, 372.8 ± 62.5; APP/PS1+Il10−/−, 294.4 ± 39.2, p > 0.05; by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test). Within the CNS, IL-10 is mainly produced by astrocytes and microglia (Ledeboer et al., 2002Ledeboer A. Brevé J.J. Wierinckx A. van der Jagt S. Bristow A.F. Leysen J.E. Tilders F.J. Van Dam A.M. Expression and regulation of interleukin-10 and interleukin-10 receptor in rat astroglial and microglial cells.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1175-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the latter being brain-resident innate immune cells that are centrally positioned to phagocytose and clear Aβ (Aguzzi et al., 2013Aguzzi A. Barres B.A. Bennett M.L. Microglia: scapegoat, saboteur, or something else?.Science. 2013; 339: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, Guillot-Sestier and Town, 2013Guillot-Sestier M.V. Town T. Innate immunity in Alzheimer’s disease: a complex affair.CNS Neurol. Disord. Drug Targets. 2013; 12: 593-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To confirm the cellular source of cerebral IL-10 in our experimental animals, Il10 mRNA levels were analyzed by qPCR in CD11b+ and CD11b− cellular fractions isolated from brain single-cell suspensions (Figure S2A). The CD11b+ cell fraction highly expressed established microglial markers (i.e., Iba1, Cx3cr1, Csf1r, and Itgb5; Figure S2A) (Butovsky et al., 2014Butovsky O. Jedrychowski M.P. Moore C.S. Cialic R. Lanser A.J. Gabriely G. Koeglsperger T. Dake B. Wu P.M. Doykan C.E. et al.Identification of a unique TGF-β-dependent molecular and functional signature in microglia.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar), while the CD11b− cell fraction expressed astrocytic and neuronal markers (i.e., S100b and Map2). Interestingly, the CD11b+ fraction was largely enriched in Il10r mRNA compared to CD11b− cells, and Il10r expression was strikingly increased in microglia from APP/PS1+ animals (Figure S2A). Finally, Il10 mRNA levels were markedly increased in microglia from APP/PS1+Il10+/+ brains, suggesting that IL-10 is produced by CD11b+ microglia and likely participates in autocrine signaling via IL-10R in brains of APP/PS1+ mice. To investigate the effect of Il10 deficiency on neuroinflammation in response to Aβ deposition, coronal sections from 12- to 13-month-old mouse brains were immunostained for ionized calcium-binding receptor 1 (Iba1) (Ahmed et al., 2007Ahmed Z. Shaw G. Sharma V.P. Yang C. McGowan E. Dickson D.W. Actin-binding proteins coronin-1a and IBA-1 are effective microglial markers for immunohistochemistry.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2007; 55: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and data showed 54%–69% significantly increased signal in APP/PS1+Il10−/− versus APP/PS1+Il10+/+ mice (Figure 2A, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01; by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test). Interestingly, in non-transgenic animals, Il10 deficiency did not modify Iba1+ immunoreactivity (% of labeled area: CC: Il10+/+, 1.35 ± 0.16; Il10−/−, 1.58 ± 0.19; EC: Il10+/+, 1.03 ± 0.15; Il10−/−, 1.44 ± 0.16; HC: Il10+/+, 2.30 ± 0.43; Il10−/−, 2.06 ± 0.23; n = 6 per genotype, by t test), indicating that Il10 deficiency selectively modified microglial phenotype in the context of the APP/PS1 transgenes. A similar pattern of statistically significant results (from 55%–64%) was observed for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-reactive astrocytes in EC and HC (Figures 2B and 2C, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗∗p < 0.001; by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test). Remarkably, APP/PS1+Il10−/− mice that still had remaining β-amyloid plaques demonstrated statistically significant 74%–143% increased CD11b+-activated microglial burden (Townsend et al., 2005Townsend K.P. Town T. Mori T. Lue L.F. Shytle D. Sanberg P.R. Morgan D. Fernandez F. Flavell R.A. Tan J. CD40 signaling regulates innate and adaptive activation of microglia in response to amyloid beta-peptide.Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in close vicinity of Aβ deposits in the CC, EC, and HC (Figures 2C and 2D, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01; by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test). Further evidence of 59%–266% significantly increased microglial activation in APP/PS1+Il10−/− mice came from CD45 immunostaining data (Figure 2E, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗∗p < 0.001; by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test) (Tan et al., 2000Tan J.

We did not observe histologic evidence of vascular cuffing or presence of round, non-process-bearing CD45 highly expressing (CD45hi) mononuclear cells (Town et al., 2008Town T. Laouar Y. Pittenger C.

Interestingly, amyloid plaques in APP/PS1+Il10−/− mice appeared more diffuse than typical dense-cored plaques present in APP/PS1+Il10+/+ mice, and were accompanied by 50%–74% increased activated CD68+ microglia (Figures 2F and 2G, ∗p < 0.05; by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test). In addition, association of microglia with amyloid deposits was significantly enhanced by 34% in APP/PS1+Il10−/− brains compared to APP/PS1+Il10+/+ littermates (p < 0,001; by t test). To assess global transcriptional changes in brains of APP/PS1 mice deficient in Il10, RNAseq was performed. Total brain mRNA was isolated from 12-month-old APP/PS1+: Il10+/+, Il10+/−, or Il10−/− animals (n = 5 per group). Clustering of individual animal expression profiles resulted in segregation of the two homozygous populations, with heterozygous animals intermixed (Figure S3). Comparative expression of 14,800 detected RefSeq genes (normalized as RPKM; average per genotype) revealed expression changes that were Il10 allele dependent (Figure 3A). Most genes remained unchanged in APP/PS1+Il10−/− versus APP/PS1+Il10+/+ mice, with only 117 genes having greater than 2-fold differences. Cluster analysis of those 117 genes was performed, resulting in three distinct patterns: A, B, and C (Figure 3B). We further defined these groups as A1, A2, B, and C, where group A1 and A2 genes were decreased in APP/PS1+Il10−/− mice and APP/PS1+Il10+/− mice had an intermediate result; group B genes were only decreased in APP/PS1+Il10−/− mice, and group C genes were increased in APP/PS1+Il10−/− mice. When these genes were further interrogated for immune-related function(s), the majority of immune genes fell into groups A1 and A2 (Figure 3B). These genes, corresponding fold changes with associated statistical significance levels, and global function(s) in immune responses are presented in Figure 3C. Interestingly, expression of Apoe (a well-established genetic risk factor for late-onset AD) was reduced in APP/PS1+Il10−/− compared to APP/PS1+Il10+/+ animals, validating microglial qPCR data (see Figure S2A). In general, immune genes with altered expression profiles were responsible for innate immune cell regulation, chemoattraction, Aβ interaction, and phagocytosis. Data described above suggested that Il10 deficiency endorsed a beneficial form of innate immune activation that favored microglial β-amyloid clearance. To directly investigate the effects of IL-10 on microglial Aβ phagocytosis, primary cultures of microglia were established from Il10+/+ or Il10−/− mice, and Aβ1-42 phagocytosis was evaluated. Remarkably, ELISA measurement of Aβ1–42 intracellular content showed recombinant IL-10 treatment to significantly decrease preaggregated Aβ1–42 uptake by 41% in Il10+/+ and 62% in Il10−/− mouse primary microglia (Figure 4A, Il10+/+, †p = 0.06 and Il10−/−, ∗∗∗p < 0.001; by one-way ANOVA and Sidak’s post hoc test), and a similar pattern of results was observed in a rat microglial cell line (data not shown). Treatment with recombinant IL-10 also (1) reduced phagolysosomal CD68 labeling by 49% (Figures S4A and S4B, ∗p < 0.05; by t test), (2) diminished intracellular Aβ1–42-cy3 signal by 46% (Figure S4C, ∗p < 0.05; by t test), and (3) induced STAT3 translocation to the nucleus (Figures S4D and S4E, ∗∗p < 0.01; by t test). These data show that IL-10 treatment shifts microglial activation away from Aβ phagocytosis via increasing activation of STAT3. In a reciprocal set of experiments, Aβ1–42 uptake was increased by 60% in Il10−/− primary microglia (Figure 4A, Il10+/+ versus Il10−/−, ∗p < 0.05; by one-way ANOVA and Sidak’s post hoc test). To determine if Stat3 knockdown could phenocopy the effect of Il10 deletion on microglial Aβ phagocytosis, we used a mouse microglial cell line (N9) that responded similarly to mouse primary microglia in terms of IL-10-dependent reduction of Aβ phagocytosis (Figure S4F, ∗p < 0.05; by t test). Three independent Stat3 knockdown microglial N9 lines were generated via shStat3 lentiviral infection, and STAT3 expression was validated by immunocytochemistry and western blot (Figures S4G and S4H). Strikingly, reduced STAT3 nuclear translocation occurred with increased Aβ1–42-cy3 within CD68+ lysosomes (Figure S4I) in the same manner as Il10 deletion. To further investigate this effect, morphology and Aβ phagocytic aptitude of Il10+/+ versus Il10−/− primary microglia were evaluated by live cell imaging. Twenty-four hours after transfection with a Lamp1-GFP construct, cells were challenged with Aβ1–42-cy3 to follow Aβ1–42 uptake into Lamp1+ phagolysosomes. Representative images from Movies S1 and S2 are shown in Figure 4B. Interestingly, Aβ1–42-cy3 was encapsulated within Lamp1+ structures in both Il10+/+ and Il10−/− microglia; however, Aβ-containing phagolysosomes were enlarged in Il10−/− microglia (Figure 4B; see white arrows and Movies S1 and S2). Strikingly, a similar pattern of results was observed in vivo. APP/PS1+ mice presented Iba1+ microglia containing 4G8+ Aβ encapsulated within Lamp1+ (Figures 4C and 4D) and CD68+ (Figure S4J) phagolysosomes. Yet, APP/PS1+Il10−/− brains had demonstrably increased abundance of Iba1+ microglia that costained for Lamp1+ lysosomes and for 4G8+ Aβ (Figures 4C and 4D). Importantly, phagolysosomes within Iba1+ cells were increased by 92% in the cortex and 140% in HC of APP/PS1+Il10−/− versus APP/PS1+Il10+/+ mice (Figure 4E, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01; by t test). Analysis of plaque-associated microglia revealed an increased proportion of cells containing phagolysosome-encapsulated amyloid in Il10-deficient animals (Figure 4F; cortex, 62%; HC, 60%, ∗∗∗p < 0.001; by t test). Finally, the total amount of 4G8+ Aβ loaded within Lamp1+ phagolysosomes was significantly augmented in APP/PS1+Il10−/− versus APP/PS1+Il10+/+ brains (Figure 4G; c"

We analyzed 8% of PKC mutations identified in human cancers and found that, surprisingly, most were loss of function and none were activating. Loss-of-function mutations occurred in all PKC subgroups and impeded second-messenger binding, phosphorylation, or catalysis. Correction of a loss-of-function PKCβ mutation by CRISPR-mediated genome editing in a patient-derived colon cancer cell line suppressed anchorage-independent growth and reduced tumor growth in a xenograft model. Hemizygous deletion promoted anchorage-independent growth, revealing that PKCβ is haploinsufficient for tumor suppression. Several mutations were dominant negative, suppressing global PKC signaling output, and bioinformatic analysis suggested that PKC mutations cooperate with co-occurring mutations in cancer drivers. These data establish that PKC isozymes generally function as tumor suppressors, indicating that therapies should focus on restoring, not inhibiting, PKC activity."

They also suggest that OFC may be placed at a relatively early stage in the hierarchy of information-seeking decisions, before evaluation is complete. Thus, our results delineate a circuit for information-seeking decisions and suggest a neural basis for curiosity. Decision makers are often confronted with the opportunity to make choices that provide information about the world (Gottlieb et al., 2013Gottlieb J. Oudeyer P.-Y. Lopes M. Baranes A. Information-seeking, curiosity, and attention: computational and neural mechanisms.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2013; 17: 585-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This information generally comes at a cost, even if it’s just the opportunity cost associated with foregoing other possible options. Nonetheless, information is so useful that we may be endowed with a basic drive to seek it out, even when it serves no obvious immediate purpose (Loewenstein, 1994Loewenstein G. The psychology of curiosity: a review and reinterpretation.Psychol. Bull. 1994; 116: 75-98Crossref Google Scholar). This drive for information is poorly understood, but is relevant for understanding learning, decision making, and social interactions (Gottlieb et al., 2013Gottlieb J. Oudeyer P.-Y. Lopes M. Baranes A. Information-seeking, curiosity, and attention: computational and neural mechanisms.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2013; 17: 585-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Recent studies have begun to identify the structures associated with curiosity and motivated information seeking more generally (Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka, 2009Bromberg-Martin E.S. Hikosaka O.

Curious monkeys have increased gray matter density in the precuneus.Neurosci. Lett. 2012; 518: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Like any other good, information can enter into decision-making processes and influence our reward-based (i.e., economic) decisions. For example, monkeys performing an information-seeking choice task will preferentially choose to have the outcomes of risky gambles revealed immediately, rather than to remain in a state of uncertainty while waiting for the outcome to be delivered (Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka, 2009Bromberg-Martin E.S. Hikosaka O.

Hikosaka O. Lateral habenula neurons signal errors in the prediction of reward information.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This behavior can be modeled in a standard economic framework in which monkeys integrate two dimensions of an option (here, its information content and the volume of its primary reward, e.g., water or juice) into a single scale to create a single dimension of subjective value. The monkey’s subjective value then serves as the basis for its choices (Padoa-Schioppa, 2011Padoa-Schioppa C. Neurobiology of economic choice: a good-based model.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The fact that information and primary reward are integrated to produce behavior suggests that they are also integrated neurally. Because information and primary reward such as food and water are distinct in many respects (visual versus gustatory, abstract versus appetitive, etc.), they are presumably first detected by different neural systems, then combined to create a common scalar value signal (Levy and Glimcher, 2012Levy D.J.

Integration of multiple determinants in the neuronal computation of economic values.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 11583-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Data from monkeys performing the information-seeking task suggest that one neural instantiation of this value scale may be the firing patterns of neurons that encode reward prediction errors (RPEs) (Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka, 2009Bromberg-Martin E.S. Hikosaka O. Midbrain dopamine neurons signal preference for advance information about upcoming rewards.Neuron. 2009; 63: 119-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka, 2011Bromberg-Martin E.S. Hikosaka O. Lateral habenula neurons signal errors in the prediction of reward information.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Specifically, during this task, RPE-coding cells generate similar signals for both primary reward and informational reward, a pattern found in both midbrain dopamine neurons (DA neurons) and one of their major inputs, the lateral habenula (LHb) (Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka, 2009Bromberg-Martin E.S.

Midbrain dopamine neurons signal preference for advance information about upcoming rewards.Neuron. 2009; 63: 119-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka, 2011Bromberg-Martin E.S. Hikosaka O. Lateral habenula neurons signal errors in the prediction of reward information.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These data suggest that integration of different value types onto a single scale occurs prior to the neural circuitry that computes RPEs (see also Lak et al., 2014Lak A. Stauffer W.R. Schultz W. Dopamine prediction error responses integrate subjective value from different reward dimensions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 2343-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that this integration process involves outputs from the OFC, a reward area that is anatomically early in the reward hierarchy and that serves as an indirect input to the dopamine system (Takahashi et al., 2011Takahashi Y.K. Roesch M.R. Wilson R.C. Toreson K. O’Donnell P. Niv Y. Schoenbaum G. Expectancy-related changes in firing of dopamine neurons depend on orbitofrontal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1590-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The OFC is important for signaling information about reward, reward learning, and regulation of reward-related cognition (Rushworth et al., 2011Rushworth M.F.S. Noonan M.P. Boorman E.D. Walton M.E. Behrens T.E. Frontal cortex and reward-guided learning and decision-making.Neuron. 2011; 70: 1054-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, Wallis, 2007Wallis J.D. Orbitofrontal cortex and its contribution to decision-making.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, Wilson et al., 2014Wilson R.C. Takahashi Y.K.

Neurobiology of economic choice: a good-based model.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). OFC may be involved in economic choice at least two ways. First, it could be a stage where all choice-relevant features are maintained in separate buffers, constituting a complete representation of task state. This would then be used as raw material from which downstream areas could compute an integrated value signal (Wilson et al., 2014Wilson R.C. Takahashi Y.K. Schoenbaum G. Niv Y. Orbitofrontal cortex as a cognitive map of task space.Neuron. 2014; 81: 267-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In this case, OFC neurons would code the presence of information or the presence of appetitive reward, but would not code their combined value or utility. Alternatively, the OFC could implement the next stage of evaluation where features are combined to create the value that guides decisions (Padoa-Schioppa, 2011Padoa-Schioppa C. Neurobiology of economic choice: a good-based model.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006Padoa-Schioppa C. Assad J.A. Neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex encode economic value.Nature. 2006; 441: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, Raghuraman and Padoa-Schioppa, 2014Raghuraman A.P. Padoa-Schioppa C. Integration of multiple determinants in the neuronal computation of economic values.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 11583-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this case, activity in OFC would depend on both appetitive reward and information in a correlated manner, and precisely to the extent that the two variables influence decisions. To test between these hypotheses, we recorded activity of OFC neurons using a novel “curiosity tradeoff task.” This task is a variant of the information-seeking task developed by Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka (Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka, 2009Bromberg-Martin E.S. Hikosaka O. Midbrain dopamine neurons signal preference for advance information about upcoming rewards.Neuron. 2009; 63: 119-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka, 2011Bromberg-Martin E.S. Hikosaka O. Lateral habenula neurons signal errors in the prediction of reward information.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). On each trial of our task, a monkey chose between gambles that differed on two dimensions: (1) water amount associated with winning the gamble and (2) informativeness, i.e., whether a cue revealed the gamble outcome in advance of its delivery. Importantly, the information allowed monkeys to fully predict the chosen gamble’s outcome, but could not be used to influence the outcome in any way. Thus, any value the monkeys assigned to information was due to its intrinsic worth, rather than any objective benefit for gathering water reward. We find that monkeys reliably choose to sacrifice water to obtain immediate information about the outcome of the gamble. Furthermore, our task allows us to measure the precise manner in which animals integrate water amount and informativeness into their judgments of subjective value. We could then test whether OFC neurons integrate these variables in the same manner as the animals do in their choice behavior (if the OFC represents subjective value) or whether OFC neurons encode these variables independently (if the OFC represents an abstract task state). We find that OFC neurons encode both water amount and informativeness, consistent with a role for the OFC in curiosity-guided choices. Furthermore, much as OFC primary reward signals reflect the value subjects assign to those rewards (Critchley and Rolls, 1996Critchley H.D. Rolls E.T. Hunger and satiety modify the responses of olfactory and visual neurons in the primate orbitofrontal cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 1673-1686PubMed Google Scholar, Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006Padoa-Schioppa C. Assad J.A.

Relative reward preference in primate orbitofrontal cortex.Nature. 1999; 398: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar), OFC information signals are correlated with the value that monkeys assign to information. However, OFC neurons had no systematic tendency to integrate the values of water and information in an appropriate manner to code the overall subjective value that guides decisions. Instead, we find that OFC neurons coded these variables in orthogonal manners, consistent with a representation of abstract task state. For example, if a given neuron was positively tuned for water amount, it was no more likely than chance to be either positively or negatively tuned for informativeness. These results are consistent with the idea that OFC precedes the value computation that guides decisions, and suggest a role in motivating curiosity-guided choices. On each trial, monkeys chose between two gambles represented by visual stimuli on the left and right sides of a screen. Each gamble yielded either a water reward or no reward with equal probability. The water amount for each gamble was drawn randomly from the range 75–375 μl in 15-μl steps, and was indicated to the monkey by the height of a white inset bar (Figure 1). Gambles also varied in their informativeness, which was indicated to the monkey by their color. Choosing the informative gamble (Figure 1, cyan bar) always led to the presentation of a visual stimulus that cued the gamble’s outcome. Choosing the uninformative gamble (Figure 1, magenta bar) led to the presentation of a visual stimulus that provided no new information. Monkeys could not make use of the information to influence the outcome of the gamble; the information merely gave them 2.25 s of advance notice. Monkeys preferred both greater water amounts and informative cues. They chose the option with the greater water amount on 81% of trials, and the option with greater informativeness on 67% of trials (both p < 0.0001, binomial test). Monkeys exhibited only small choice biases favoring offers based on non-reward features such as their location on the screen (choice of rightmost offer: subject B 54%, subject H 53%) or presentation order (choice of first presented offer: subject B 51%, subject H 51%). We calculated each monkey’s probability of choosing the informative option as a function of the difference in water amount between the two options (Figure 2A ). When the two options had equal water amounts, both monkeys strongly preferred information (subject B: 83% choice; subject H: 83% choice). Monkeys were only indifferent when the informative option offered a considerably smaller amount of water (subject B: on average 74-μl difference; subject H: 44-μl difference). This indifference point identifies the monkey’s willingness to pay for information, and hence serves as a measure of the subjective value that the monkey assigns to that information (cf. Deaner et al., 2005Deaner R.O. Khera A.V. Platt M.L. Monkeys pay per view: adaptive valuation of social images by rhesus macaques.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 543-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Once we account for the 50% probability of gambles, our data indicate that the monkeys would give up 37 μl (subject B) or 22 μl (subject H) of water to gain information. This translates to a substantial fraction of the water they were offered. The expected reward size averaged over all offers was 112.5 μl of water. Thus, monkeys paid an average of 33% of offered water (subject B) or 20% of offered water (subject H) in exchange for just a few seconds of advance information. Do monkeys adjust their willingness to pay for information about a gamble’s outcome based on the water amount at stake? To test this, we estimated the monkey’s probability of choosing info as a function of the water amounts of both the informative and uninformative options (Figures 2C and 2D). We then plotted an indifference curve, tracing through all combinations of water amounts for the two options for which the monkeys chose the two options with equal probability (Figures 2C and 2D, black line). If monkeys assigned a fixed value to information regardless of the stakes, then the indifference curve would be a straight line with a slope of 1. Instead, the indifference curve had a slope steeper than 1 for both monkeys (m = 1.24 for subject B, 1.23 for subject H). The subjective value of information was an essentially linear function of the stakes in both monkeys (Figure 2B). These data suggest that the value of information may have a multiplicative effect on the value of water amount, just as probability does in a conventional gambling task, time does in a discounting task, or effort does in an effort task. Other analysis confirmed that the increasing value of information was not due to decreasing marginal utility of water (Figure S2). Thus, monkeys integrated both the availability of information and the amount of water at stake in order to arrive at their decisions. We collected responses of 113 OFC neurons (n = 72 in subject B and n = 41 in subject H). We obtained an average of 522 trials per neuron (range: 396–818 trials). We first examined neural coding of water amount and informativeness. These two features of each offer were chosen independently, making it straightforward to separately measure their influences on neural activity. Furthermore, we presented the offers to the monkey one by one, which allowed us to separately measure neural coding of the two offers. To compare tuning properties of neurons, we quantified each neuron’s tuning with the regression coefficients from a linear regression of firing rate against offered water amount and informativeness. To compare between regression coefficients from neurons with different firing properties we first normalized (Z scored) neural firing rates and regressors (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). However, we obtained the same qualitative results from performing regression on the raw data (data not shown). Neurons with significant regression coefficients for water amount or informativeness (p < 0.05 for this and all further statistical tests) were deemed to code these variables. We observed significant coding of water amount for Offer 1 in 30% of neurons (n = 34/113; Figures 3A , 3C, and 3E) and informativeness in 15% of neurons (n = 17/113; Figures 3B, 3D, and 3E). The number of informativeness-coding neurons was greater than expected by chance (p = 0.0005, one-sided binomial test against the 5% expected by chance). When the second offer was presented, we observed significant coding of water amount in 29% of neurons (n = 33/113) and informativeness in 25% of neurons (n = 28/113). Both proportions were greater than chance (p < 0.001). Latency analysis suggested that OFC water amount and information signals are present simultaneously in OFC (Figure S3). We find a strong positive correlation between the signals our population of neurons used to encode the water amounts of the two offers (r = +0.68, p < 0.001; Figures 4A and 4C ). In other words, a neuron that is excited by the presentation of a large water amount for Offer 1 will also tend to be excited by large water amounts for Offer 2. We find a similar positive correlation for informativeness signals between the two offers (r = +0.33, p < 0.001; Figures 4B and 4C). Thus, neural tuning to the individual aspects of the two offers was similar regardless of the order of presentation. Further analysis confirmed that neurons consistently coded features of the currently presented offer, regardless of other variables. For instance, neurons used similar codes for the water amounts of the informative and non-informative offers, and did not have a predominant tendency to encode the water amount of the second offer relative to the previously presented first offer (Figure S4) consistent with previous studies (Rudebeck et al., 2013Rudebeck P.H. Mitz A.R. Chacko R.V. Murray E.A. Effects of amygdala lesions on reward-value coding in orbital and medial prefrontal cortex.Neuron. 2013; 80: 1519-1531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). OFC signals for primary reward are known to be sensitive to the subjective value of those rewards. We therefore asked whether the same was true for OFC information signals. Did OFC neurons simply encode a binary distinction, information versus no information? Or did OFC neurons signal the value that the information has to the animal? Our data allow us to test between these hypotheses because animals assigned greater value to information when a greater amount of water was at stake. Thus, if OFC neurons signal the value of information, their information signals should grow with the offered water amount. Indeed, OFC information signals were enhanced during high-stakes offers. The cell in Figure 5A , for instance, had activity negatively related to offer informativeness, and this negative informativeness signal was stronger on trials when the offered water amount was high (Figure 5A). To quantify this phenomenon, we examined the neuron’s regression coefficient for the term representing the interaction between informativeness and water amount (“Info × Water,” Figure 5B). This cell had a significant negative coefficient for informativeness, indicating that it was inhibited by informative offers, and a significant negative coefficient for the Info × Water interaction, indicating that its inhibition was stronger on trials when the offered water amount was high. The OFC population as a whole had a similar response pattern. Neurons were generally modulated by the Info × Water interaction in consistent manners for both offers (r = +0.31, p < 0.001), similar to their consistent coding of main effects (Figure 4). Hence, for this analysis we pooled data by averaging each neuron’s regression coefficients from the two offers. We then asked whether neural responses to information, measured as the main effect of informativeness, were consistently modulated by water amount, measured by the Info × Water interaction. Indeed, these regression coefficients had a clear positive correlation (r = +0.41, p < 0.001; Figures 5C and 5E; similar results were found from analyzing individual offers, Offer 1: r = +0.20, p = 0.032; Offer 2: r = +0.31, p = 0.001). In other words, cells that were responsive to information were more responsive during high-stakes offers, when animals assigned the information greater value. Our data also allow us to test between two hypotheses about the detailed mechanisms that generate information seeking. One hypothesis is that subjects value information because it allows them to physically or mentally prepare for reward delivery, thus increasing the amount of subjective value they can extract from the primary reward (Perkins, 1955Perkins Jr., C.C. The stimulus conditions which follow learned responses.Psychol. Rev. 1955; 62: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). If this were the case then OFC water signals should be enhanced for informative offers, because informed water reward would have higher value than uninformed water reward. Alternately, the brain could assign a distinct value to information in its own right. If that were the case then OFC water signals should have no net enhancement by information, because the presence of information would have no effect on the value of water. Our data support the latter view: there was no systematic tendency for signals coding water reward to be enhanced by the promise of information about those rewards. There was no significant correlation between neural modulation by the Info × Water interaction and neural coding of water amount (r = −0.13, p = 0.175; Figures 5D and 5E). Furthermore, the neural interaction effect was significantly more correlated with information signals than water amount signals (difference of correlations = 0.54, bootstrap 99.5% CI excludes zero; Figure 5E). This suggests that information is assigned value in its own right, rather than merely enhancing the value of water reward, at least at the level of the OFC. OFC neurons appear to signal the value of information to the animal. However, monkeys prefer both water and information. This raises the question: do OFC neurons integrate the values of both water and information, and thus encode the overall subjective value of the option that guides decisions? If so, they should respond to water amount and informativeness with the same sign, and with strength proportional to their influence on choice. In contrast, if neurons code multiple task variables independently, then they ought to use unrelated signals to encode water amount and informativeness. Some neurons coded both variables in similar manners—for instance, neurons that fired more for informative offers and fired more for large water amounts (Figures 3A and 3B). However, other neurons coded them in opposite manners—for instance, neurons that fired more for informative offers, but fired more for small water amounts (Figures 3C and 3D). If neurons tend to be tuned in the same way for the two variables then their regression coefficients should be positively correlated; if neurons code the variables independently, their correlation should be zero. We found that the regression coefficients for water amount and informativeness had no significant correlation, with an R value close to zero. The same result occurred consistently for neural responses to the first offer (r = −0.08, 95% CI [−0.26,+0.11], p = 0.414; Figures 6A and 6D ) and for responses to the second offer (r = −0.06, 95% CI [−0.24,+0.13], p = 0.514; Figures 6B and 6D). Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between the regression coefficients for water amount and for the interaction that modulated the value of information (Figure 5E). It is possible we did not detect a correlation between water and information coding because we had too few trials to detect these signals. This seems unlikely, however, as we were able to detect strong and significant correlations between the same regression coefficients when comparing within-attribute, e.g., water coding of Offer 1 versus water coding of Offer 2 (Figure 4). Furthermore, we also detected clear correlations between regression coefficients when comparing across-attribute, e.g., informativeness coding versus interaction effects (Figure 5).

In contrast, we find that Myc haploinsufficient (Myc(+/-)) mice exhibit increased lifespan. They show resistance to several age-associated pathologies, including osteoporosis, cardiac fibrosis, and immunosenescence. They also appear to be more active, with a higher metabolic rate and healthier lipid metabolism. Transcriptomic analysis reveals a gene expression signature enriched for metabolic and immune processes. The ancestral role of MYC as a regulator of ribosome biogenesis is reflected in reduced protein translation, which is inversely correlated with longevity. We also observe changes in nutrient and energy sensing pathways, including reduced serum IGF-1, increased AMPK activity, and decreased AKT, TOR, and S6K activities. In contrast to observations in other longevity models, Myc(+/-) mice do not show improvements in stress management pathways. Our findings indicate that MYC activity has a significant impact on longevity and multiple aspects of mammalian healthspan."

Here, we report an unexpected molecular mechanism that underlies ligand-dependent enhancer activation, based on DNA nicking to relieve torsional stress from eRNA synthesis. Using dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced binding of androgen receptor (AR) to prostate cancer cell enhancers as a model, we show rapid recruitment, within minutes, of DNA topoisomerase I (TOP1) to a large cohort of AR-regulated enhancers. Furthermore, we show that the DNA nicking activity of TOP1 is a prerequisite for robust eRNA synthesis and enhancer activation and is kinetically accompanied by the recruitment of ATR and the MRN complex, followed by additional components of DNA damage repair machinery to the AR-regulated enhancers. Together, our studies reveal a linkage between eRNA synthesis and ligand-dependent TOP1-mediated nicking-a strategy exerting quantitative effects on eRNA expression in regulating AR-bound enhancer-dependent transcriptional programs."
https://openalex.org/W2056641815,"The mechanisms by which dietary salt promotes hypertension are unknown. Previous work established that plasma [Na+] and osmolality rise in proportion with salt intake and thus promote release of vasopressin (VP) from the neurohypophysis. Although high levels of circulating VP can increase blood pressure, this effect is normally prevented by a potent GABAergic inhibition of VP neurons by aortic baroreceptors. Here we show that chronic high salt intake impairs baroreceptor inhibition of rat VP neurons through a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent activation of TrkB receptors and downregulation of KCC2 expression, which prevents inhibitory GABAergic signaling. We show that high salt intake increases the spontaneous firing rate of VP neurons in vivo and that circulating VP contributes significantly to the elevation of arterial pressure under these conditions. These results provide the first demonstration that dietary salt can affect blood pressure through neurotrophin-induced plasticity in a central homeostatic circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2104340213,"Baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae rapidly converts sugars to ethanol and carbon dioxide at both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The later phenomenon is called Crabtree effect and has been described in two forms, long-term and short-term effect. We have previously studied under fully controlled aerobic conditions forty yeast species for their central carbon metabolism and the presence of long-term Crabtree effect. We have also studied ten steady-state yeast cultures, pulsed them with glucose, and followed the central carbon metabolism and the appearance of ethanol at dynamic conditions. In this paper we analyzed those wet laboratory data to elucidate possible mechanisms that determine the fate of glucose in different yeast species that cover approximately 250 million years of evolutionary history. We determine overflow metabolism to be the fundamental mechanism behind both long- and short-term Crabtree effect, which originated approximately 125–150 million years ago in the Saccharomyces lineage. The “invention” of overflow metabolism was the first step in the evolution of aerobic fermentation in yeast. It provides a general strategy to increase energy production rates, which we show is positively correlated to growth. The “invention” of overflow has also simultaneously enabled rapid glucose consumption in yeast, which is a trait that could have been selected for, to “starve” competitors in nature. We also show that glucose repression of respiration is confined mainly among S. cerevisiae and closely related species that diverged after the whole genome duplication event, less than 100 million years ago. Thus, glucose repression of respiration was apparently “invented” as a second step to further increase overflow and ethanol production, to inhibit growth of other microbes. The driving force behind the initial evolutionary steps was most likely competition with other microbes to faster consume and convert sugar into biomass, in niches that were semi-anaerobic."

Here we show that, in the Drosophila brain, focal activation of even a single glomerulus recruits GABAergic interneurons in all glomeruli. Moreover, the relative level of interneuron activity in different glomeruli is largely odor invariant. Although interneurons are recruited nonspecifically, glomeruli differ dramatically in their sensitivity to interneuron activity, and this is explained by their varying sensitivity to GABA.

Interestingly, a stimulus is typically encoded in parallel by channels having high and low sensitivity to inhibition. Because lateral inhibition confers both costs and benefits, the brain might rely preferentially on “high” and “low” channels in different behavioral contexts. In some brain regions, a neuron’s preferred stimulus and its physical location are systematically related. In these “topographic” regions, neurons that are physically near each other often have similar tuning. Because most inhibitory interneurons act locally, inhibition in these brain regions occurs mainly between neurons whose activity is correlated (Kaas, 1997Kaas J.H. Topographic maps are fundamental to sensory processing.Brain Res. Bull. 1997; 44: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Lateral inhibition in topographic networks allows neurons to encode finer details by removing the coarse (i.e., shared) components of their signals (Srinivasan et al., 1982Srinivasan M.V.

It also reduces redundancy, thereby conserving metabolic resources (Barlow, 1961Barlow H.G. Possible principles underlying the transformation of sensory messages.in: Rosenblith W.A. Sensory Communication. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1961: 217-234Google Scholar). However, many brain regions are non-topographic (or only weakly topographic), where neighboring neurons can have very different stimulus preferences (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010Bandyopadhyay S.

In general, it is not clear to what extent lateral inhibitory connections are selective in non-topographic networks. An example of a non-topographic circuit is the brain’s first odor processing relay, the antennal lobe in insects and the olfactory bulb in vertebrates (Vosshall and Stocker, 2007Vosshall L.B.

Greer C.A. Olfactory bulb.in: Shepherd G.M. The Synaptic Organization of the Brain. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 159-203Google Scholar). Each coding channel (or glomerulus) in this circuit receives convergent projections from many olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), all of which express the same odorant receptor. Within each glomerulus, ORNs synapse onto second-order neurons, each of which receives direct ORN input from just one glomerulus. Thus, each glomerulus defines a discrete processing channel. Although each glomerulus has a stereotyped location, the arrangement of glomeruli displays little or no topography—i.e., odor-evoked input to glomeruli that are physically near one another is no more correlated than the input to any random pair of glomeruli (Couto et al., 2005Couto A.

Odors typically activate multiple ORN types, and the output of a glomerulus depends on its interactions with other coactivated glomeruli. In particular, glomeruli inhibit each other via inhibitory local interneurons (“lateral inhibition”). One fact relevant to lateral inhibition is that odor-evoked activity tends to be correlated across ORNs, meaning that an odor that strongly activates one ORN type typically elicits strong activity in many other ORN types (Haddad et al., 2010Haddad R. Weiss T. Khan R. Nadler B. Mandairon N. Bensafi M. Schneidman E. Sobel N.

One proposed function of lateral inhibition is to reduce these correlations at the level of second-order neurons (Cleland, 2014Cleland T.A.

An important outstanding question in olfaction is the degree of selectivity in lateral inhibition. In the olfactory bulb, the evidence for selective connectivity is mixed (Fantana et al., 2008Fantana A.L. Soucy E.R. Meister M.

USA. 2006; 103: 12592-12597Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Physiological studies in the olfactory bulb have inferred lateral inhibitory connectivity indirectly, based on the premise that anti-correlated activity in two glomeruli reflects an inhibitory connection between them. This question can be addressed more directly in the Drosophila antennal lobe. The Drosophila antennal lobe is compact and genetically accessible, and the activity of inhibitory local neurons (LNs) can be optically monitored within each glomerulus (Ng et al., 2002Ng M. Roorda R.D. Lima S.Q. Zemelman B.V. Morcillo P. Miesenböck G.

Lateral inhibition in this circuit is known to play a key role in gain control (Olsen and Wilson, 2008Olsen S.R. Wilson R.I.

Here we address two outstanding questions regarding interglomerular inhibition. First, how specific are inhibitory interactions between glomeruli? Previous studies have suggested that inhibition is sparse and specific (Girardin et al., 2013Girardin C.C. Kreissl S. Galizia C.G.

Some individual LNs innervate all glomeruli, whereas others innervate just a subset of glomeruli, so any of these scenarios is possible (Chou et al., 2010Chou Y.H. Spletter M.L. Yaksi E. Leong J.C.

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neural connections in the Drosophila antennal lobe.J. Comp. Neurol. 2009; 514: 74-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Second, are all glomeruli equally sensitive to the effects of LN activation? Glomeruli are differentially innervated by individual inhibitory LNs (Chou et al., 2010Chou Y.H. Spletter M.L. Yaksi E. Leong J.C. Wilson R.I. Luo L. Diversity and wiring variability of olfactory local interneurons in the Drosophila antennal lobe.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Glomeruli also express variable levels of GABA receptor and show variable responses to a synthetic GABAB agonist (Root et al., 2008Root C.M. Masuyama K. Green D.S. Enell L.E. Nässel D.R. Lee C.H. Wang J.W. A presynaptic gain control mechanism fine-tunes olfactory behavior.Neuron. 2008; 59: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In principle, either mechanism could produce variations in sensitivity to LN activation, but this has not been investigated. In this study, we find that the recruitment of inhibition is relatively nonspecific, and indeed, activating a single glomerulus recruits LN activity in all glomeruli. Nonetheless, glomeruli vary dramatically in their sensitivity to LN activation, i.e., their “inhibitability.” We propose that this organization allows some channels to realize the benefits of lateral inhibition, while allowing other channels to remain relatively immune from the costs of lateral inhibition—namely, noise and ambiguity. These results have broad relevance for how population diversity within a circuit can resolve competing constraints on neural processing. We began by asking whether inhibitory interactions between glomeruli are specific. We selected odor stimuli that excite only one ORN type, and we asked how the spatial pattern of activity in GABAergic LNs depends on the identity of the glomerulus that is receiving direct ORN input. If inhibition is sparse and glomerulus specific, the glomerular pattern of LN activity should be different for odors that activate different ORN types, and focal stimulation should in principle be the clearest way to reveal this. We identified eight odor stimuli that should drive activity primarily in a single ORN type, which we call “private” odor stimuli (Hallem and Carlson, 2006Hallem E.A. Carlson J.R. Coding of odors by a receptor repertoire.Cell. 2006; 125: 143-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, Olsen et al., 2010Olsen S.R. Bhandawat V. Wilson R.I.

Olfactory processing and behavior downstream from highly selective receptor neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To visualize the pattern of ORN input evoked by each stimulus, we expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP3 (Tian et al., 2009Tian L. Hires S.A. Mao T. Huber D. Chiappe M.E. Chalasani S.H. Petreanu L. Akerboom J. McKinney S.A. Schreiter E.R. et al.Imaging neural activity in worms, flies and mice with improved GCaMP calcium indicators.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 875-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar) in ORNs under the control of the Gal4-UAS system. We then used in vivo two-photon microscopy to image odor-evoked signals in ORN axons terminating in the antennal lobe. As expected, each private odor stimulus elicited a fluorescence increase at the position corresponding to its cognate glomerulus (Figures 1A and 1B ). In some experiments, one or two additional glomeruli were also weakly activated, but this was unusual. To visualize LN activity elicited by focal ORN input, we expressed GCaMP3 in a large subset of GABAergic LNs using the NP3056-Gal4 driver (Chou et al., 2010Chou Y.H. Spletter M.L. Yaksi E. Leong J.C.

The NP3056-Gal4 driver labels between 50 and 60 LNs in the antennal lobe, and most individual LNs in this population innervate most or all glomeruli (Chou et al., 2010Chou Y.H. Spletter M.L. Yaksi E.

Thus, the calcium signal in each glomerulus represents the pooled activity of many LNs, and the signal in every glomerulus originates from mostly the same group of individual LNs. We found that each private odor elicited LN activity in all glomeruli (Figures 1C and 1D and data not shown). Moreover, similar spatial patterns of activity were elicited by different odors. This outcome was observed in two independent rounds of experiments performed with different odor stimulus sets, each containing four private odors (odor set 1 and odor set 2). Similar results were also observed with a second Gal4 driver that labels about 25–30 GABAergic LNs (GH298-Gal4; Figure S1). These two LN drivers are expressed in large but mostly non-overlapping subsets of LNs. Together, they cover 8 of the 9 major morphological types of GABAergic LNs, including both pan-glomerular LNs and LNs with selective glomerular innervation patterns (Chou et al., 2010Chou Y.H. Spletter M.L. Yaksi E. Leong J.C. Wilson R.I. Luo L. Diversity and wiring variability of olfactory local interneurons in the Drosophila antennal lobe.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Both drivers and all odors produced essentially the same global pattern of LN activity. To evaluate the similarity across brains in the spatial pattern of LN activity, we computed the average response across odors for each brain and measured the relative level of LN calcium signal in different glomeruli in that average image (Figure 1E). This quantification showed that the relative level of LN activity varied about 3-fold across glomeruli, with each glomerulus exhibiting a characteristic level of activity in every brain. The differences between glomeruli in the average amount of odor-evoked LN calcium signal may reflect spatial heterogeneities in calcium entry, buffering, or extrusion across the branches of individual LNs. Although the spatial patterns of LN activity were relatively stimulus invariant, small differences were observed for some stimuli (Figures 1C and 1D). To search for putative odor-specific patterns of LN activity in an unbiased manner, we used principal component analysis (PCA). In each imaging plane, we performed PCA on the four images that were collected in the same experiment, one image for each odor. If all odors elicited the same pattern of activity, then almost all of the variance across odors would be explained by one “basis image” (i.e., the first principal component or PC1) that resembles the average across odors, and the remaining basis images (PC2 and upward) would simply capture noise. This prediction was largely true: PC1 captured the stereotyped and global spatial pattern evoked by all odors (Figures 2A and 2B ), and it accounted for most of the explainable variance in the data (Figure S2). However, PCA also pulled out three glomeruli that were modulated independently of other glomeruli. These three glomeruli are DA2, VL2a, and V. These are the cognate glomeruli for geosmin, phenylacetaldehyde, and CO2, respectively, and they each consistently emerged as PC2 in the appropriate position and imaging plane in the experiments that included these odors (odor set 2, Figure 2B). Thus, although all stimuli elicited a similar overall spatial pattern of LN activity, some private odor stimuli appeared to elicit additional activity in their cognate glomerulus. To test this idea directly, we quantified the amount of LN activity in each of the eight glomeruli targeted by our “private” odors. As expected, we found that LN activity in DA2, VL2a, and V was significantly stronger when the stimulus was the cognate private odor for that glomerulus, as compared to other odors (Figure 2C). For all other glomeruli (DM4, VM7, VA6, DL1, and DL5), there was no significant difference between the level of LN activity elicited by their cognate private odor and other odors (Figure 2C). This analysis confirms the results of the unbiased PCA search: some stimuli elicit additional intraglomerular inhibition, as well as recruiting lateral inhibition to all other glomeruli. In addition, these results indicate that PCA can successfully identify glomeruli that are recruited in an odor-specific manner. Notably, no other individual glomeruli, or subsets of glomeruli, were observed in any principal components. Thus, although PCA is demonstrably able to identify single glomeruli that are modulated in an odor-specific manner, it does not identify any additional glomeruli where LN activity is comodulated. This analysis argues that there are no strong inhibitory subnetworks linking specific groups of glomeruli. Next, we asked whether these results generalize across a range of odor concentrations. We tested a family of concentrations for several odors. In each case, we found that the relative level of LN activity in different glomeruli was similar across odor concentrations. However, the overall level of LN activity grew with increasing concentration (Figures 3A and 3C ). Higher concentrations activate more ORN types and also drive higher spike rates in activated ORNs (Hallem and Carlson, 2006Hallem E.A. Carlson J.R. Coding of odors by a receptor repertoire.Cell. 2006; 125: 143-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Both mechanisms are likely to contribute to the overall increase in LN activity. When we averaged LN activity across the antennal lobe and plotted this against the logarithm of the odor-evoked field potential recorded from ORNs (Figure 3B), we observed a linear relationship for all odors (Figure 3D). Because the ORN field potential scales linearly with the total number of ORN spikes (Olsen et al., 2010Olsen S.R. Bhandawat V. Wilson R.I. Divisive normalization in olfactory population codes.Neuron. 2010; 66: 287-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), we can infer that LN activity scales with the logarithm of total ORN spike rate. Interestingly, not all odors were equally efficient at recruiting LN activity, even when they evoked equal levels of total ORN activity. For example, 10−4 pentyl acetate and 10−6 E2-hexenal elicited similar levels of total ORN activity (Figure 3B). However, 10−4 pentyl acetate elicited stronger overall LN activity than did 10−6 E2-hexenal (Figures 3A and 3C–3E). This difference may reflect the fact that the pentyl acetate stimulus elicits ORN spiking that is distributed across more ORN types (Hallem and Carlson, 2006Hallem E.A. Carlson J.R. Coding of odors by a receptor repertoire.Cell. 2006; 125: 143-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Alternatively, or in addition, some ORN or PN types may make particularly strong synapses onto LNs. In sum, these results show that ORN input to a single glomerulus can recruit LN activity globally in all glomeruli and that the relative level of LN activity across most glomeruli is similar for all odor stimuli. Stimulation of some ORN types elicits additional LN activity in their target glomeruli. Finally, the level of LN activity in each glomerulus scales with the logarithm of total ORN firing rate. Taken together, these results indicate that lateral inhibition in the antennal lobe is broadly recruited by inputs pooled across most glomeruli and argue against selective interactions between neurons corresponding to specific subnetworks of glomeruli. We next turned our attention from the recruitment of LNs to the consequences of LN activation. In particular, we asked whether LN activation has different effects on different antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs), the second-order neurons of the olfactory system. To activate LNs, we used an optogenetic method rather than odor stimuli, an approach that confers several advantages. First, by not using odors, we avoided eliciting varying levels of excitation to different PNs, a situation that would confound our measurements of inhibition in PNs. Second, optogenetics allows for the direct, robust, and scalable activation of LNs. We expressed the light-activated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in a large subset of LNs under the control of NP3056-Gal4. Whole-cell recordings from LNs that express ChR2 confirmed that LN spike rates rise with increasing light intensity, and light evokes no response in ChR2-negative LNs (Figure S3). Calcium imaging of ChR2-mediated LN activation revealed that interleaved light and odor stimuli elicit essentially identical spatial patterns of LN activity (Figures 4A and 4B ). Thus, optogenetic LN activation serves as a convenient stand-in for odor-evoked LN activation. To measure the consequences of LN activation, we monitored spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in PNs, which arise from spontaneous spiking in ORNs (Figure 4C; Kazama and Wilson, 2008Kazama H.

Wilson R.I. Origins of correlated activity in an olfactory circuit.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Spontaneous EPSCs are a sensitive measure of inhibition because the primary locus of GABAergic inhibition is at ORN axon terminals, with a more minor role for inhibition at PN dendrites (Olsen and Wilson, 2008Olsen S.R.

We note that stimulating GABAergic LNs can recruit not only lateral inhibition, but also lateral excitation, because GABAergic LNs are electrically coupled to specialized cells that also couple to PNs (Huang et al., 2010Huang J.

To eliminate this confound, we conducted these experiments in a genetic background that blocks these electrical connections (shakB mutant; Yaksi and Wilson, 2010Yaksi E. Wilson R.I.

We observed that optogenetic activation of LNs suppressed sEPSCs in most PNs, and this effect was blocked by GABA receptor antagonists (Figures 4C and 4D). In PNs, increasing light intensity increased the suppression of"

Our findings reveal a central role for neural population tuning in linking visual cortical anatomy to visual perception and suggest that a perceptually advantageous visual cortex is a thinned one with an enlarged surface area. The cerebral cortex is a neural sheet composed vertically of ontogenetic cortical columns and horizontally of laminar layers (Rakic, 1988Rakic P.

The columnar organization of the neocortex.Brain. 1997; 120: 701-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). The surface area of cerebral cortex depends on the proliferation of cortical columns, whereas the thickness of cerebral cortex depends on the generation of laminar layers (Rakic, 1974Rakic P.

However, controlled by independent sets of genetic-developmental factors, cortical thickness and cortical surface area exhibit distinct patterns of variability (Rakic, 1988Rakic P.

Cortical surface area has expanded over 1,000-fold from small mammals to humans (Blinkov and Glezer, 1968Blinkov S.M. Glezer I.J. The Human Brain in Figures and Tables: A Quantitative Handbook. Plenum Press, New York1968Google Scholar, Rakic, 1988Rakic P. Specification of cerebral cortical areas.Science. 1988; 241: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2348) Google Scholar). Even within the human species, the surface area of a cortical region, such as visual cortical surface area, can vary up to 3-fold across healthy adults (Dougherty et al., 2003Dougherty R.F. Koch V.M. Brewer A.A. Fischer B. Modersitzki J. Wandell B.A. Visual field representations and locations of visual areas V1/2/3 in human visual cortex.J. Vis. 2003; 3: 586-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). By contrast, cortical thickness has only doubled during mammalian evolution and differs marginally across human individuals (Blinkov and Glezer, 1968Blinkov S.M. Glezer I.J. The Human Brain in Figures and Tables: A Quantitative Handbook. Plenum Press, New York1968Google Scholar, Rakic, 1988Rakic P. Specification of cerebral cortical areas.Science. 1988; 241: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2348) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, cortical thickness can vary over 3-fold across different cortical locations within the same cortical region of the same individual (Fischl and Dale, 2000Fischl B. Dale A.M. Measuring the thickness of the human cerebral cortex from magnetic resonance images.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 11050-11055Crossref PubMed Scopus (4147) Google Scholar, Hilgetag and Barbas, 2006Hilgetag C.C. Barbas H. Role of mechanical factors in the morphology of the primate cerebral cortex.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: e22Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This substantial variability in cortical anatomy has attracted great interest in the study of its behavioral consequences, and recent progress has been made in identifying correlations between higher performance on a variety of behavioral tasks and larger local cortical volume in task-relevant cortical regions (Kanai and Rees, 2011Kanai R. Rees G. The structural basis of inter-individual differences in human behaviour and cognition.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 12: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). However, the fundamental questions of whether a larger cortical volume is in essence behaviorally advantageous and why cortical volume is behaviorally relevant remain to be addressed. An intuitive hypothesis is that increases in cortical volume, arising either from increased cortical thickness or cortical surface area, improve behavioral performance by engaging responses from more neurons (Haug, 1987Haug H. Brain sizes, surfaces, and neural sizes of the cerebral cortex: A stereological investigation of man and his variability and a comparison with some mammals.Am. J. Anat. 1987; 180: 126-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and increasing the overall signal-to-noise ratio (Gilbert et al., 2001Gilbert C.D. Sigman M. Crist R.E. The neural basis of perceptual learning.Neuron. 2001; 31: 681-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Alternatively, changes in behavioral performance may be driven by changes in neural response properties that are associated with variation in local cortical volume and potentially associated differently with cortical thickness versus cortical surface area, as these two anatomical dimensions exhibit distinct natures that affect different aspects of intracortical processing (Kaas, 2000Kaas J. Why is brain size so important: Design problems and solutions as neocortex gets bigger or smaller.Brain Mind. 2000; 1: 7-23Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Specifically, cortical thickness characterizes local (point-level) cortical anatomy, where the thickness at different cortical locations within a cortical region can be independently assessed and reflects the result of tissue proliferation. By contrast, cortical surface area characterizes global (region-level) cortical anatomy, where the surface area of a cortical region is determined jointly by the set of cortical locations it bounds and reflects the result of cortical arealization. As such, variability in the surface area of a cortical region might globally influence all the cortical columns within that region and intercolumnar processing between them, whereas variability in the thickness at a cortical location might locally influence the cortical column at that location and interlaminar processing within it. To test our two hypotheses, we therefore investigated whether cortical thickness and cortical surface area, which both contribute to cortical volume, had similar or different functional impacts for neural response properties and human behavioral performance. In human cerebral cortex, the neural response properties of many cortical regions are hard to characterize using noninvasive neuroimaging techniques. Due to the limited spatial resolution of fMRI signals, different neurons within a single fMRI voxel tend to exhibit heterogeneous response properties that often render the voxel-level characterization of neural responses qualitatively different from the response properties of single neurons. An exception to this limitation is early retinotopic visual cortices. Neurons in early visual cortices respond to visual field position in an orderly fashion, where cortically adjacent neurons are tuned to spatially adjacent visual field positions (Hubel and Wiesel, 1974Hubel D.H. Wiesel T.N. Uniformity of monkey striate cortex: a parallel relationship between field size, scatter, and magnification factor.J. Comp. Neurol. 1974; 158: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, Sereno et al., 1995Sereno M.I. Dale A.M. Reppas J.B. Kwong K.K. Belliveau J.W. Brady T.J. Rosen B.R. Tootell R.B. Borders of multiple visual areas in humans revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging.Science. 1995; 268: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). This relative similarity in tuning responses between different neurons within a single fMRI voxel allows fMRI-based characterization of neural population tuning (Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008Dumoulin S.O. Wandell B.A. Population receptive field estimates in human visual cortex.Neuroimage. 2008; 39: 647-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, Fischer and Whitney, 2009Fischer J. Whitney D. Attention narrows position tuning of population responses in V1.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1356-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Given the close correspondence between neural tuning properties and perceptual discrimination performance (Purushothaman and Bradley, 2005Purushothaman G. Bradley D.C. Neural population code for fine perceptual decisions in area MT.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), this fMRI-based characterization of neural population tuning enabled us to explore the behavioral significance of any influence that cortical anatomy may have on neural response properties. Using human early visual cortices (V1 and V2) as a model system, we investigated how visual cortical thickness and visual cortical surface area influenced neural population tuning for visual field position, and whether such influences had behavioral consequences on perceptual discrimination for visual field position. Since visual cortical thickness captures the differences between visual field positions in the cortical architecture at corresponding visual cortical locations, we studied how thickness at different visual cortical locations related to the width of neural population tuning and the0 of perceptual discrimination for corresponding visual field positions. On the other hand, since visual cortical surface area reflects the differences between individuals in the proportion of cortex devoted to early visual processing, we studied how surface area of early visual cortices influenced the position tuning width and position discrimination threshold across the visual field in general. For a group of 20 healthy participants, we used structural MRI, high-resolution fMRI, and visual psychophysics to measure anatomy of early visual cortices (V1 and V2), population tuning of visual cortical neurons, and performance in perceptual discrimination, respectively. The psychophysical experiments assessing perceptual discrimination were conducted outside the scanner, while the neuroimaging experiments assessing visual cortical anatomy and neural population tuning were performed inside the scanner. During data analysis, we explored the relationships among these independent measures reflecting cortical anatomy, neural response properties, and behavioral performance, respectively. Delineation of early visual cortices (V1 and V2) used the standard method of retinotopic mapping (Sereno et al., 1995Sereno M.I. Dale A.M. Reppas J.B. Kwong K.K. Belliveau J.W. Brady T.J. Rosen B.R. Tootell R.B. Borders of multiple visual areas in humans revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging.Science. 1995; 268: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). The mapped visual field covered an eccentricity range from 0.25 to 7.2 degree of visual angle. To improve the delineation accuracy of polar angle boundaries (representing vertical and horizontal meridians), we conducted two different retinotopic mapping experiments using phase-encoded paradigm (Sereno et al., 1995Sereno M.I. Dale A.M. Reppas J.B. Kwong K.K. Belliveau J.W. Brady T.J. Rosen B.R. Tootell R.B. Borders of multiple visual areas in humans revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging.Science. 1995; 268: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) and population-receptive-field paradigm (Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008Dumoulin S.O. Wandell B.A. Population receptive field estimates in human visual cortex.Neuroimage. 2008; 39: 647-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), respectively. To improve the delineation accuracy of eccentricity boundaries (representing 0.25 and 7.2 degree eccentricity), the eccentricity boundaries delineated from the two retinotopic mapping experiments were refined in a third experiment using a retinotopic localizer. The performance of retinotopic-based delineation was assessed through comparison with morphology-based delineation, where the medial occipital cortex was segmented according to the cortical folding patterns (Desikan et al., 2006Desikan R.S. Ségonne F. Fischl B. Quinn B.T. Dickerson B.C. Blacker D. Buckner R.L. Dale A.M. Maguire R.P. Hyman B.T. et al.An automated labeling system for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on MRI scans into gyral based regions of interest.Neuroimage. 2006; 31: 968-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (7180) Google Scholar). We found that the delineation of early visual cortices was consistent across different delineation protocols (Figure S1 available online; Supplemental Experimental Procedures section 2). After the delineation of early visual cortices, we measured visual cortical thickness and visual cortical surface area by applying the surface-based analysis on the structural MRI data collected using the standard T1-weighted MRI sequence. In the analysis, the structural MRI data were segmented into different cortical tissues, from which the 3D cortical surface was reconstructed in a smooth triangle-mesh model, with each vertex of this mesh representing a single cortical location distinguishable by MRI (Dale et al., 1999Dale A.M. Fischl B. Sereno M.I. Cortical surface-based analysis. I. Segmentation and surface reconstruction.Neuroimage. 1999; 9: 179-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (7053) Google Scholar). Based on this 3D cortical surface reconstruction, we measured the thickness at individual visual cortical locations (vertices) and the surface area summed over different visual cortical locations. The MRI-based measure of visual cortical anatomy was potentially confounded by the choice of data analysis software. Therefore, we repeated the analysis in four established software packages, SPM (Ashburner, 2012Ashburner J. SPM: a history.Neuroimage. 2012; 62: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), Freesurfer (Fischl, 2012Fischl B. FreeSurfer.Neuroimage. 2012; 62: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (4127) Google Scholar), FSL (Jenkinson et al., 2012Jenkinson M. Beckmann C.F. Behrens T.E. Woolrich M.W. Smith S.M. FSL.Neuroimage. 2012; 62: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (6154) Google Scholar), and MIPAV CBS (Bazin et al., 2013Bazin P.L. Weiss M. Dinse J. Schäfer A. Trampel R. Turner R. A computational framework for ultra-high resolution cortical segmentation at 7 Tesla.Neuroimage. 2013; (Published online April 25, 2013)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.03.077Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar), in order to separate the contributions of software specific versus software independent factors. We found that the MRI-based measure of visual cortical anatomy was not biased by the specific choice of data analysis software (Supplemental Experimental Procedures section 3.1). Our MRI-based measure of visual cortical anatomy was also potentially vulnerable to any confounding influences of data acquisition sequence. Specifically, while the T1-weighted MRI sequence we employed is a widely used standard protocol, the signal in fact represents a combination of magnetic-field-specific and biological-tissue-specific components. As a result, the T1-weighted MRI images had inhomogenous intensity and low tissue contrast that could potentially lead to bias in the segmentation of cortical tissues. To address this limitation in quality of the standard T1-weighted MRI sequence, in control experiments, we collected the structural MRI data using a state-of-art quantitative-T1 MRI sequence, at both a high resolution (0.8 millimeter [mm] isotropic voxels) and a standard resolution (1 mm isotropic voxels). Through the detection of multiple parametric signals, the quantitative-T1 MRI sequence factored out the magnetic-field-specific component and directly reflected the physical property of the underlying biological tissue (Weiskopf et al., 2013Weiskopf N. Suckling J. Williams G. Correia M.M. Inkster B. Tait R. Ooi C. Bullmore E.T. Lutti A. Quantitative multi-parameter mapping of R1, PD, MT, and R2 at 3T: a multi-center validation.Front. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 95Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). As such, the quantitative-T1 MRI images had homogeneous intensity and high tissue contrast that greatly reduced potential bias in the surface-based analysis (Figure S2). Although the standard T1-weighted MRI sequence had image quality limitations, we found that the MRI-based measure of visual cortical anatomy was nonetheless robust against such limitations and was strongly correlated across different data acquisition sequences (Supplemental Experimental Procedures section 3.2). From our MRI-based measure of visual cortical anatomy, we studied variability in visual cortical surface area and visual cortical thickness. Consistent with previous reports (Dougherty et al., 2003Dougherty R.F. Koch V.M. Brewer A.A. Fischer B. Modersitzki J. Wandell B.A. Visual field representations and locations of visual areas V1/2/3 in human visual cortex.J. Vis. 2003; 3: 586-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), the retinotopically delineated visual cortical surface area exhibited a 2-fold interindividual variability (Figure 1A, summed across left and right hemispheres; V1, 2,213 mm2 to 3,328 mm2 and V2, 1,611 mm2 to 2,936 mm2) that was correlated between V1 and V2 (Figure 1A; r = 0.568, p < 0.05, n = 20). As the retinotopy delineation covered a part rather than the full extent of early visual cortices, we further explored interindividual variability in the fraction of retinotopy coverage, based on the distribution of mapped visual field eccentricity derived from the eccentricity map. This distribution was best fitted with an exponential function y = ae−bx, which reflected the percentage of voxels responsive to each visual field eccentricity (Figure 1B). Given that different voxels were equal in volume, we estimated the retinotopically delineated part of early visual cortices as the area under the exponential curve from x equaled 0.25 degree eccentricity to x equaled 7.2 degree eccentricity, and the full extent of early visual cortices as the area under the exponential curve from x equaled 0 to x approximated infinite. We found that in both V1 and V2, the retinotopically delineated part accounted for about three-quarters of the full area. This fraction of retinotopy coverage was rather consistent across participants (V1, mean = 78.3%, SD = 3.7%, n = 20 and V2, mean = 78.8%, SD = 3.3%, n = 20) and did not correlate with the measure of visual cortical surface area (V1, r = −0.120, p = 0.564, n = 20 and V2, r = 0.080, p = 0.768, n = 20). Therefore, we concluded that the retinotopically delineated visual cortical surface area captured true anatomical variability. Compared to the large degree of interindividual variability in visual cortical surface area, the average thickness of early visual cortices varied across participants to a much smaller degree from 2 mm to 2.5 mm. Nevertheless, within individual participants, visual cortical thickness varied across different visual cortical locations from 1 mm to 4 mm following a Gaussian distribution (Figure 2). In addition to this general intraindividual variability in visual cortical thickness, we observed an intraindividual increase in visual cortical thickness from sulci to gyri and from parafovea (central 2.0 degree eccentricity) to perifovea. This increase in visual cortical thickness from parafovea to perifovea was observed for both sulci (V1, T = 6.533, p < 0.0001, n = 20 and V2, T = 8.359, p < 0.0001, n = 20) and gyri (V1, T = 6.509, p < 0.0001, n = 20 and V2, T = 8.874, p < 0.0001, n = 20). In a similar fashion, the increase in visual cortical thickness from sulci to gyri was observed for both parafovea (V1, T = 7.113, p < 0.0001, n = 20 and V2, T = 8.357, p < 0.0001, n = 20) and perifovea (V1, T = 9.972, p < 0.0001, n = 20 and V2, T = 9.471, p < 0.0001, n = 20). While the structural MRI data allowed a noninvasive, in vivo measure of visual cortical anatomy, the measure was, at the same time, limited by its indirect nature. In contrast, a direct measure of cortical anatomy (albeit in vitro) is possible from postmortem histology. Therefore, we further addressed the reliability of our in vivo MRI measure by comparing it with an in vitro histology measure derived from postmortem human brain. Conventional analysis of histology data employs a slice-based approach that is constrained by the slice orientation and has a limited sampling coverage. For example, the slice-based measure of cortical thickness is only valid for histology slices orthogonal to the cortical surface. To overcome this limitation, we developed a surface-based approach and applied it to a data set of high-resolution (40 μm isotropic pixel) whole-brain (4,992 pixel × 3,328 pixel) histology images (502 images in total), taken consecutively every 300 μm along the dorsoventral axis of a postmortem human brain. In the analysis, we manually segmented each histology image into different cortical tissues, from which we reconstructed the 3D cortical surface and acquired the surface-based measure of visual cortical anatomy (Figure S3; Supplemental Experimental Procedures section 3.3). While time-consuming, this surface-based analysis offered a sampling coverage of the full brain that was unconstrained by the slice orientation. From this histology-based measure of visual cortical anatomy, we observed a substantial degree of intraindividual variability in visual cortical thickness (Figure S4) that was similar in extent to the MRI-based measure (Figure 2). Moreover, the dependence of visual cortical thickness on cortical folding and visual field eccentricity that we observed in the structural MRI data was recaptured by the histology data. Specifically, we observed an increase in visual cortical thickness from sulci to gyri for both parafovea (V1, T = 13.498, p < 0.0001, n = 87,455 voxels and V2, T = 18.179, p < 0.0001, n = 86,466 voxels) and perifovea (V1, T = 23.822, p < 0.0001, n = 230,387 voxels and V2, T = 9.507, p < 0.0001, n = 50,348 voxels), as well as an increase in visual cortical thickness from parafovea to perifovea for both sulci (V1, T = 83.929, p < 0.0001, n = 146,834 voxels and V2, T = 56.089, p < 0.0001, n = 72,410 voxels) and gyri (V1, T = 97.783, p < 0.0001, n = 171,008 voxels and V2, T = 49.674, p < 0.0001, n = 64,404 voxels). The consistency with the in vitro histology measure validated our application of in vivo structural MRI data to assess visual cortical anatomy. Our measure of neural population tuning for visual field position was based on the established method of population-receptive-field mapping (Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008Dumoulin S.O. Wandell B.A. Population receptive field estimates in human visual cortex.Neuroimage. 2008; 39: 647-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In the experiment, a bar stimulus was presented at different visual field positions, and the BOLD time series recorded from each voxel in early visual cortices was deconvolved with a hemodynamic response function before fitting with a 2D Gaussian characterization of position tuning profile (Supplemental Experimental Procedures section 4.1). The 2D Gaussian function characterized the range of visual field positions that the voxel responded to (position tuning width) and the visual field position where the voxel responded the strongest (position tuning peak). We acquired the measure of position tuning for individual visual cortical locations (vertices) from single fMRI voxels, where the exact cortical depth of the voxels did not affect the measure (Figure S5; Supplemental Experimental Procedures section 4.2). This measure of neural population tuning reflected a combined contribution from the average position tuning width of neurons in the voxel and the heterogeneity in position tuning peak between different neurons in the voxel (Hubel and Wiesel, 1974Hubel D.H. Wiesel T.N. Uniformity of monkey striate cortex: a parallel relationship between field size, scatter, and magnification factor.J. Comp. Neurol. 1974; 158: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). To improve the resolution of the measure and minimize intravoxel heterogeneity in position tuning peak, we collected the fMRI data at a high spatial resolution (1.5 mm isotropic voxel) using a 3D echo plannar imaging acquisition sequence with parallel imaging acceleration (Lutti et al., 2013Lutti A. Thomas D.L. Hutton C. Weiskopf N. High-resolution functional MRI at 3 T: 3D/2D echo-planar imaging with optimized physiological noise correction.Magn. Reson. Med. 2013; 69: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For tissue volumes as small as 1.5 mm isotropic, the heterogeneity in position tuning peak is smaller than the position tuning width of single neurons and is correlated with the average position tuning width of neurons in the tissue volume (Hubel and Wiesel, 1974Hubel D.H. Wiesel T.N. Uniformity of monkey striate cortex: a parallel relationship between field size, scatter, and magnification factor.J. Comp. Neurol. 1974; 158: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). As such, the voxel-level measure of the position tuning width in effect reflected the average tuning width of neurons in the voxel. Indeed, this voxel-level position tuning width (0.6 ± 0.35 degree of visual angle) measured here in the retinotopically delineated part of human primary visual cortex was comparable with neural-level position tuning width (0.35 degree of visual angle) in the corresponding part of macaque primary visual cortex (Hubel and Wiesel, 1974Hubel D.H. Wiesel T.N. Uniformity of monkey striate cortex: a parallel relationship between field size, scatter, and magnification factor.J. Comp. Neurol. 1974; 158: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Despite the improvement in spatial resolution offered by the advanced fMRI acquisition sequence, our measure of the position tuning width was nonetheless still potentially confounded by the temporal lag between neural responses and fMRI signals due to hemodynamic coupling. This potential confounding factor was taken into consideration during the experiment where the BOLD time series was deconvolved with an empirically derived hemodynamic response function before fitting with a 2D Gaussian characterization of position tuning profile. Across voxels, we did not observe significant correlations between the measure of the position tuning width and the parameters of the hemodynamic response function, suggesting that the measure largely reflected the neural response properties rather than the hemodynamic response properties (Supplemental Experimental Procedures section 4.3).

https://openalex.org/W2060772994,"Objective To evaluate the diagnostic value of the Inlet-to-outlet median nerve area ratio (IOR) in patients with clinically and electrophysiologically confirmed carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Methods Forty-six wrists in 46 consecutive patients with clinical and electrodiagnostic evidence of CTS and forty-four wrists in 44 healthy volunteers were examined with ultrasonography. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve was measured at the carpal tunnel inlet (the level of scaphoid-pisiform) and outlet (the level of the hook of the hamate), and the IOR was calculated for each wrist. Ultrasonography and electrodiagnostic tests were performed under blinded conditions. Electrodiagnostic testing combined with clinical symptoms were considered to be the gold standard test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic value between the inlet CSA and IOR. Results The study population included 16 men and 30 women (mean age, 45.3 years; range, 18–83 years). The control population included 18 men and 26 women (mean age, 50.4 years; range, 18–79 years). The mean inlet CSA was 8.7 mm2 in healthy controls and 14.6mm2 in CTS group (P<0.001). The mean IOR in healthy volunteers (1.0) was smaller than that in patients (1.6, P<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed a diagnostic advantage to using the IOR rather than the inlet CSA (P<0.01). An IOR cutoff value of ≥ 1.3 would yield 93% specificity and 91% sensitivity in the diagnosis of CTS. Conclusion The IOR of median nerve area promises to be an effective means in the diagnosis of CTS. A large-scale, randomized controlled trial is required to determine how and when this parameter will be used."
https://openalex.org/W2062400937,"Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a powerful technique for examining gene expression changes during tumorigenesis. Target gene expression is generally normalized by a stably expressed endogenous reference gene; however, reference gene expression may differ among tissues under various circumstances. Because no valid reference genes have been documented for human breast cancer cell lines containing different cancer subtypes treated with transient transfection, we identified appropriate and reliable reference genes from thirteen candidates in a panel of 10 normal and cancerous human breast cell lines under experimental conditions with/without transfection treatments with two transfection reagents. Reference gene expression stability was calculated using four algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and comparative delta Ct), and the recommended comprehensive ranking was provided using geometric means of the ranking values using the RefFinder tool. GeNorm analysis revealed that two reference genes should be sufficient for all cases in this study. A stability analysis suggests that 18S rRNA-ACTB is the best reference gene combination across all cell lines; ACTB-GAPDH is best for basal breast cancer cell lines; and HSPCB-ACTB is best for ER+ breast cancer cells. After transfection, the stability ranking of the reference gene fluctuated, especially with Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent in two subtypes of basal and ER+ breast cell lines. Comparisons of relative target gene (HER2) expression revealed different expressional patterns depending on the reference genes used for normalization. We suggest that identifying the most stable and suitable reference genes is critical for studying specific cell lines under certain circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W2057632290,"SB056 is a novel semi-synthetic antimicrobial peptide with a dimeric dendrimer scaffold. Active against both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, its mechanism has been attributed to a disruption of bacterial membranes. The branched peptide was shown to assume a β-stranded conformation in a lipidic environment. Here, we report on a rational modification of the original, empirically derived linear peptide sequence [WKKIRVRLSA-NH2, SB056-lin]. We interchanged the first two residues [KWKIRVRLSA-NH2, β-SB056-lin] to enhance the amphipathic profile, in the hope that a more regular β-strand would lead to a better antimicrobial performance. MIC values confirmed that an enhanced amphiphilic profile indeed significantly increases activity against both Gram-positive and -negative strains. The membrane binding affinity of both peptides, measured by tryptophan fluorescence, increased with an increasing ratio of negatively charged/zwitterionic lipids. Remarkably, β-SB056-lin showed considerable binding even to purely zwitterionic membranes, unlike the original sequence, indicating that besides electrostatic attraction also the amphipathicity of the peptide structure plays a fundamental role in binding, by stabilizing the bound state. Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism and solid-state 19F-NMR were used to characterize and compare the conformation and mobility of the membrane bound peptides. Both SB056-lin and β-SB056-lin adopt a β-stranded conformation upon binding POPC vesicles, but the former maintains an intrinsic structural disorder that also affects its aggregation tendency. Upon introducing some anionic POPG into the POPC matrix, the sequence-optimized β-SB056-lin forms well-ordered β-strands once electro-neutrality is approached, and it aggregates into more extended β-sheets as the concentration of anionic lipids in the bilayer is raised. The enhanced antimicrobial activity of the analogue correlates with the formation of these extended β-sheets, which also leads to a dramatic alteration of membrane integrity as shown by 31P-NMR. These findings are generally relevant for the design and optimization of other membrane-active antimicrobial peptides that can fold into amphipathic β-strands."
https://openalex.org/W2140641873,"One of humanity’s major challenges of the 21st century will be meeting future food demands on an increasingly resource constrained-planet. Global food production will have to rise by 70 percent between 2000 and 2050 to meet effective demand which poses major challenges to food production systems. Doing so without compromising environmental integrity is an even greater challenge. This study looks at the interdependencies between land and water resources, agricultural production and environmental outcomes in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), an area of growing importance in international agricultural markets. Special emphasis is given to the role of LAC’s agriculture for (a) global food security and (b) environmental sustainability. We use the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT)—a global dynamic partial equilibrium model of the agricultural sector—to run different future production scenarios, and agricultural trade regimes out to 2050, and assess changes in related environmental indicators. Results indicate that further trade liberalization is crucial for improving food security globally, but that it would also lead to more environmental pressures in some regions across Latin America. Contrasting land expansion versus more intensified agriculture shows that productivity improvements are generally superior to agricultural land expansion, from an economic and environmental point of view. Finally, our analysis shows that there are trade-offs between environmental and food security goals for all agricultural development paths."

However, few studies have reported the addition of LAB Enterococcus faecalis as alternatives to growth promoting antibiotics for weaned piglets. This study evaluated the effects of dietary E. faecalis LAB31 on the growth performance, diarrhea incidence, blood parameters, fecal bacterial and Lactobacillus communities in weaned piglets. A total of 360 piglets weaned at 26 ± 2 days of age were randomly allotted to 5 groups (20 pens, with 4 pens for each group) for a trial of 28 days: group N (negative control, without antibiotics or probiotics); group P (Neomycin sulfate, 100 mg/kg feed); groups L, M and H (supplemented with E. faecalis LAB31 0.5×109, 1.0×109, and 2.5×109 CFU/kg feed, respectively). Average daily gain and feed conversion efficiency were found to be higher in group H than in group N, and showed significant differences between group H and group P (P0 < 0.05). Furthermore, groups H and P had a lower diarrhea index than the other three groups (P0 < 0.05). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed that the application of probiotics to the diet changed the bacterial community, with a higher bacterial diversity in group M than in the other four groups. Real-time PCR revealed that the relative number of Lactobacillus increased by addition of probiotics, and was higher in group H than in group N (P0 < 0.05). However, group-specific PCR-DGGE showed no obvious difference among the five groups in Lactobacillus composition and diversity. Therefore, the dietary addition of E. faecalis LAB31 can improve growth performance, reduce diarrhea, and increase the relative number of Lactobacillus in feces of weaned piglets."
https://openalex.org/W2010717540,"The causes of Parkinson disease (PD) remain mysterious, although some evidence supports mitochondrial dysfunctions and α-synuclein accumulation in Lewy bodies as major events. The abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein has been associated with a deficiency in the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Cathepsin D (cathD), the major lysosomal protease responsible of α-synuclein degradation was described to be up-regulated in PD model. As glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) regulate cathD activity, and have been recently suggested to participate in PD physiopathology, we investigated their role in α-synuclein accumulation by their intracellular regulation of cathD activity. In a classical neuroblastoma cell model of PD induced by MPP+, the genetic expression of GAGs-biosynthetic enzymes was modified, leading to an increase of GAGs amounts whereas intracellular level of α-synuclein increased. The absence of sulfated GAGs increased intracellular cathD activity and limited α-synuclein accumulation. GAGs effects on cathD further suggested that specific sequences or sulfation patterns could be responsible for this regulation. The present study identifies, for the first time, GAGs as new regulators of the lysosome degradation pathway, regulating cathD activity and affecting two main biological processes, α-synuclein aggregation and apoptosis. Finally, this opens new insights into intracellular GAGs functions and new fields of investigation for glycobiological approaches in PD and neurobiology."
https://openalex.org/W2007053330,"The aim of this study was to characterize the swelling and floating behaviors of gastroretentive drug delivery system (GRDDS) composed of hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) and to optimize HEC/NaCMC GRDDS to incorporate three model drugs with different solubilities (metformin, ciprofloxacin, and esomeprazole). Various ratios of NaCMC to HEC were formulated, and their swelling and floating behaviors were characterized. Influences of media containing various NaCl concentrations on the swelling and floating behaviors and drug solubility were also characterized. Finally, release profiles of the three model drugs from GRDDS formulation (F1-4) and formulation (F1-1) were examined. Results demonstrated when the GRDDS tablets were tested in simulated gastric solution, the degree of swelling at 6 h was decreased for each formulation that contained NaCMC in comparison to those in de-ionized water (DIW). Of note, floating duration was enhanced when in simulated gastric solution compared to DIW. Further, the hydration of tablets was found to be retarded as the NaCl concentration in the medium increased resulting in smaller gel layers and swelling sizes. Dissolution profiles of the three model drugs in media containing various concentrations of NaCl showed that the addition of NaCl to the media affected the solubility of the drugs, and also their gelling behaviors, resulting in different mechanisms for controlling a drug’s release. The release mechanism of the freely water-soluble drug, metformin, was mainly diffusion-controlled, while those of the water-soluble drug, ciprofloxacin, and the slightly water-soluble drug, esomeprazole, were mainly anomalous diffusion. Overall results showed that the developed GRDDS composed of HEC 250HHX and NaCMC of 450 cps possessed proper swelling extents and desired floating periods with sustained-release characteristics."

This study aims to contribute DNA barcode records for all ground squirrel species (Xerinae, Sciuridae, Rodentia) inhabiting Eurasia and to test efficiency of this approach for species discrimination. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene sequences were obtained for 97 individuals representing 16 ground squirrel species of which 12 were correctly identified. Taxonomic allocation of some specimens within four species was complicated by geographically restricted mtDNA introgression. Exclusion of individuals with introgressed mtDNA allowed reaching a 91.6% identification success rate. Significant COI divergence (3.5–4.4%) was observed within the most widespread ground squirrel species (Spermophilus erythrogenys, S. pygmaeus, S. suslicus, Urocitellus undulatus), suggesting the presence of cryptic species. A single putative NUMT (nuclear mitochondrial pseudogene) sequence was recovered during molecular analysis; mitochondrial COI from this sample was amplified following re-extraction of DNA. Our data show high discrimination ability of 100 bp COI fragments for Eurasian ground squirrels (84.3%) with no incorrect assessments, underscoring the potential utility of the existing reference librariy for the development of diagnostic ‘mini-barcodes’."

https://openalex.org/W2139641232,"Introduction The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway can downregulate inflammation via the release of acetylcholine (ACh) by the vagus nerve. This neurotransmitter binds to the α7 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChR), expressed on macrophages and other immune cells. We tested the pharmacological and functional profile of two novel compounds, PMP-311 and PMP-072 and investigated their role in modulating collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice. Methods Both compounds were characterized with binding, electrophysiological, and pharmacokinetic studies. For in vivo efficacy studies in the CIA model the compounds were administered daily by oral gavage from day 20 till sacrifice at day 34. Disease progression was monitored by visual clinical scoring and measurement of paw swelling. Inflammation and joint destruction were examined by histology and radiology. Results Treatment with PMP-311 was effective in preventing disease onset, reducing clinical signs of arthritis, and reducing synovial inflammation and bone destruction. PMP-072 also showed a trend in arthritis reduction at all concentrations tested. The data showed that while both compounds bind to α7nAChR with high affinity, PMP-311 acts like a classical agonist of ion channel activity, and PMP-072 can actually act as an ion channel antagonist. Moreover, PMP-072 was clearly distinct from typical competitive antagonists, since it was able to act as a silent agonist. It synergizes with the allosteric modulator PNU-120596, and subsequently activates desensitized α7nAChR. However, PMP-072 was less efficacious than PMP-311 at both channel activation and desensitization, suggesting that both conducting and non-conducting states maybe of importance in driving an anti-inflammatory response. Finally, we found that the anti-arthritic effect can be observed despite limited penetration of the central nervous system. Conclusions These data provide direct evidence that the α7nAChR in immune cells does not require typical ion channel activation to exert its antiinflammatory effects."

All the patients used 18F-FES PET/CT as a diagnostic tool with a clinical dilemma. We used the maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax) to quantify ER expression and a cutoff value of 1.5 to dichotomize results into ER positive and negative lesions. All patients were clinically followed up at least 6 months.In evaluating equivocal lesions on conventional work-up group (n = 4), three lung lesions and another iliac lesion were enrolled. As for three lung lesions, 18F-FES PET/CT showed one lesion with high uptake, which suggested it was an ER positive metastasis. The other two lesions were 18F-FES negative, which meant an ER negative metastasis or secondary primary tumor. Additionally, one iliac lesion was detected by MRI. 18F-FDG uptake was high at the suspected lesion, whereas 18F-FES uptake was absent; In predicting origin of metastasis group (n = 2), two breast cancer patients had secondary primary tumors were collected. They were 18F-FES negative, which showed low possibility of metastasis from breast cancer and they were all confirmed by biopsy. In detecting ER status in metastasis group (n = 27), 18F-FES PET/CT showed increased 18F-FES uptake in all metastatic lesions in 11 patients; absent in all lesions in 13 patients; and the remaining 3 patients had both 18F-FES positive and negative lesions. Totally, on the basis of the 18F-FES PET/CT results, we found changes in the treatment plans in 16 patients (48.5%, 16/33).18F-FES PET/CT could assess the entire tumor volume receptor status; therefore, it may be used to assist the individualized treatment decisions of breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2070755681,"Ischemia followed by reperfusion contributes to the initial damage to allografts after kidney transplantation (ktx). In this study we tested the hypothesis that a tetrapeptide EA-230 (AQGV), might improve survival and attenuate loss of kidney function in a mouse model of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) and ischemia-induced delayed graft function after allogenic kidney transplantation. IRI was induced in male C57Bl/6N mice by transient bilateral renal pedicle clamping for 35 min. Treatment with EA-230 (20–50mg/kg twice daily i.p. for four consecutive days) was initiated 24 hours after IRI when acute kidney injury (AKI) was already established. The treatment resulted in markedly improved survival in a dose dependent manner. Acute tubular injury two days after IRI was diminished and tubular epithelial cell proliferation was significantly enhanced by EA-230 treatment. Furthermore, CTGF up-regulation, a marker of post-ischemic fibrosis, at four weeks after IRI was significantly less in EA-230 treated renal tissue. To learn more about these effects, we measured renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 28 hours after IRI. EA-230 improved both GFR and RBF significantly. Next, EA-230 treatment was tested in a model of ischemia-induced delayed graft function after allogenic kidney transplantation. The recipients were treated with EA-230 (50 mg/kg) twice daily i.p. which improved renal function and allograft survival by attenuating ischemic allograft damage. In conclusion, EA-230 is a novel and promising therapeutic agent for treating acute kidney injury and preventing IRI-induced post-transplant ischemic allograft injury. Its beneficial effect is associated with improved renal perfusion after IRI and enhanced regeneration of tubular epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1990963963,"Cocaine has a short half-life of only about an hour but its effects, predominantly on the central nervous system (CNS), are fairly long-lasting. Of all cells within the CNS, astrocytes may be the first to display cocaine toxicity owing to their relative abundance in the brain. Cocaine entry could trigger several early response changes that adversely affect their survival, and inhibiting these changes could conversely increase their rate of survival. In order to identify these changes and the minimal concentrations of cocaine that can elicit them in vitro, rat C6 astroglia-like cells were treated with cocaine (2–4 mM for 1h) and assayed for alterations in gross cell morphology, cytoplasmic vacuolation, viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, glutathione (GSH) levels, cell membrane integrity, F-actin cytoskeleton, and histone methylation. We report here that all of the above identified features are significantly altered by cocaine, and may collectively represent the key pathology underlying acute toxicity-mediated death of astroglia-like cells. Pretreatment of the cells with the clinically available antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 5 mM for 30 min) inhibited these changes during subsequent application of cocaine and mitigated cocaine-induced toxicity. Despite repeated cocaine exposure, NAC pretreated cells remained highly viable and post NAC treatment also increased viability of cocaine treated cells to a smaller yet significant level. We show further that this alleviation by NAC is mediated through an increase in GSH levels in the cells. These findings, coupled with the fact that astrocytes maintain neuronal integrity, suggest that compounds which target and mitigate these early toxic changes in astrocytes could have a potentially broad therapeutic role in cocaine-induced CNS damage."

In the present study, we found that treatment with baicalein induced a significant inhibitory effect on proliferation and promoted apoptosis in GBC-SD and SGC996 cells, two widely used gallbladder cancer cell lines. Additionally, treatment with baicalein inhibited the metastasis of GBC cells. Moreover, we demonstrated for the first time that baicalein inhibited GBC cell growth and metastasis via down-regulation of the expression level of Zinc finger protein X-linked (ZFX). In conclusion, our studies suggest that baicalein may be a potential phytochemical flavonoid for therapeutics of GBC and ZFX may serve as a molecular marker or predictive target for GBC."
https://openalex.org/W2062037597,"Purpose Limbic epileptogenesis triggers molecular and cellular events that foster the establishment of aberrant neuronal networks that, in turn, contribute to temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Here we have examined hippocampal neuronal network activities in the pilocarpine post-status epilepticus model of limbic epileptogenesis and asked whether or not the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived lipid mediator, neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), modulates epileptogenesis. Methods Status epilepticus (SE) was induced by intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine in adult male C57BL/6 mice. To evaluate simultaneous hippocampal neuronal networks, local field potentials were recorded from multi-microelectrode arrays (silicon probe) chronically implanted in the dorsal hippocampus. NPD1 (570 μg/kg) or vehicle was administered intraperitoneally daily for five consecutive days 24 hours after termination of SE. Seizures and epileptiform activity were analyzed in freely-moving control and treated mice during epileptogenesis and epileptic periods. Then hippocampal dendritic spines were evaluated using Golgi-staining. Results We found brief spontaneous microepileptiform activity with high amplitudes in the CA1 pyramidal and stratum radiatum in epileptogenesis. These aberrant activities were attenuated following systemic NPD1 administration, with concomitant hippocampal dendritic spine protection. Moreover, NPD1 treatment led to a reduction in spontaneous recurrent seizures. Conclusions Our results indicate that NPD1 displays neuroprotective bioactivity on the hippocampal neuronal network ensemble that mediates aberrant circuit activity during epileptogenesis. Insight into the molecular signaling mediated by neuroprotective bioactivity of NPD1 on neuronal network dysfunction may contribute to the development of anti-epileptogenic therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2056666521,"The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of ginseng-based steroid Rg1 on TNF-alpha and IL-10 gene expression in human skeletal muscle against exercise challenge, as well as on its ergogenic outcomes. Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trials were performed, separated by a 4-week washout. Healthy young men were randomized into two groups and received capsule containing either 5 mg of Rg1 or Placebo one night and one hour before exercise. Muscle biopsies were conducted at baseline, immediately and 3 h after a standardized 60-min cycle ergometer exercise. While treatment differences in glycogen depletion rate of biopsied quadriceps muscle during exercise did not reach statistical significance, Rg1 supplementations enhanced post-exercise glycogen replenishment and increased citrate synthase activity in the skeletal muscle 3 h after exercise, concurrent with improved meal tolerance during recovery (P<0.05). Rg1 suppressed the exercise-induced increases in thiobarbituric acids reactive substance (TBARS) and reversed the increased TNF-alpha and decreased IL-10 mRNA of quadriceps muscle against the exercise challenge. PGC-1 alpha and GLUT4 mRNAs of exercised muscle were not affected by Rg1. Maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) was not changed by Rg1. However, cycling time to exhaustion at 80% VO2max increased significantly by ~20% (P<0.05). Conclusion: Our result suggests that Rg1 is an ergogenic component of ginseng, which can minimize unwanted lipid peroxidation of exercised human skeletal muscle, and attenuate pro-inflammatory shift under exercise challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2045845551,"Mertk belongs to the Tyro3, Axl and Mertk (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, and plays a pivotal role in regulation of cytoskeletal rearrangement during phagocytosis. Phagocytosis by either professional or non-professional phagocytes is impaired in the Mertk deficient individual. In the present study, we further investigated the effects of Mertk mutation on peritoneal macrophage morphology, attachment, spreading and movement. Mertk-mutated macrophages exhibited decreased attachment, weak spreading, loss of spindle-like body shape and lack of clear leading and trailing edges within the first few hours of culture, as observed by environmental scanning electron microscopy. Time-lapse video photography recording showed that macrophage without Mertk conducted mainly random movement with oscillating swing around the cell body, and lost the directional migration action seen on the WT cells. Western blotting showed a decreased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Immunocytochemistry revealed that actin filaments and dynamic protein myosin II failed to concentrate in the leading edge of migrating cells. Microtubules were localized mainly in one side of mutant cell body, with no clear MTOC and associated radially-distributed microtubule bundles, which were clearly evident in the WT cells. Our results suggest that Mertk deficiency affects not only phagocytosis but also cell shape and migration, likely through a common regulatory mechanism on cytoskeletons."
https://openalex.org/W2127428544,"The microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-132 and miR-212 have been found to regulate synaptic plasticity and cholinergic signaling and recent work has demonstrated roles outside of the CNS, including in smooth muscle. Here, we examined if miR-132 and miR-212 are induced in the urinary bladder following outlet obstruction and whether this correlates with effects on gene expression and cell growth. Three to seven-fold induction of miR-132/212 was found at 10 days of obstruction and this was selective for the detrusor layer. We cross-referenced putative binding sites in the miR-132/212 promoter with transcription factors that were predicted to be active in the obstruction model. This suggested involvement of Creb and Ahr in miR-132/212 induction. Creb phosphorylation (S-133) was not increased, but the number of Ahr positive nuclei increased. Moreover, we found that serum stimulation and protein kinase C activation induced miR-132/212 in human detrusor cells. To identify miR-132/212 targets, we correlated the mRNA levels of validated targets with the miRNA levels. Significant correlations between miR-132/212 and MeCP2, Ep300, Pnkd and Jarid1a were observed, and the protein levels of MeCP2, Pnkd and Ache were reduced after obstruction. Reduction of Ache however closely matched a 90% reduction of synapse density arguing that its repression was unrelated to miR-132/212 induction. Importantly, transfection of antimirs and mimics in cultured detrusor cells increased and decreased, respectively, the number of cells and led to changes in MeCP2 expression. In all, these findings show that obstruction of the urethra increases miR-132 and miR-212 in the detrusor and suggests that this influences gene expression and limits cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2009689041,"Background Tissue factor (TF) pathway inhibitor (TFPI) exists in two isoforms; TFPIα and TFPIβ. Both isoforms are cell surface attached mainly through glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. TFPIα has also been proposed to bind other surface molecules, like glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Cell surface TFPIβ has been shown to exert higher anticoagulant activity than TFPIα, suggesting alternative functions for TFPIα. Further characterization and search for novel TFPI binding partners is crucial to completely understand the biological functions of cell associated TFPI. Methods and Results Potential association of TFPI to heparan sulphate (HS) proteoglycans in the syndecan family were evaluated by knock down studies and flow cytometry analysis. Cell surface colocalization was assessed by confocal microscopy, and native PAGE or immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting was used to test for protein interaction. Heparanase was used to enzymatically degrade cell surface HS GAGs. Anticoagulant potential was evaluated using a factor Xa (FXa) activity assay. Knock down of syndecan-3 in endothelial,- smooth muscle- and breast cancer cells reduced the TFPI surface levels by 20-50%, and an association of TFPIα to syndecan-3 on the cell surface was demonstrated. Western blotting indicated that TFPIα was found in complex with syndecan-3. The TFPI bound to syndecan-3 did not inhibit the FXa generation. Removal of HS GAGs did not release TFPI antigen from the cells. Conclusions We demonstrated an association between TFPIα and syndecan-3 in vascular cells and in cancer cells, which did not appear to depend on HS GAGs. No anticoagulant activity was detected for the TFPI associated with syndecan-3, which may indicate coagulation independent functions for this cell associated TFPI pool. This will, however, require further investigation."

Whether the uric acid-associated genes have an impact on T2D remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the effects of the uric acid-associated genes on the risk of T2D as well as glucose metabolism and insulin secretion.We recruited 2,199 normal glucose tolerance subjects from the Shanghai Diabetes Study I and II and 2,999 T2D patients from the inpatient database of Shanghai Diabetes Institute. Fifteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapped in or near 11 loci (PDZK1, GCKR, LRP2, SLC2A9, ABCG2, LRRC16A, SLC17A1, SLC17A3, SLC22A11, SLC22A12 and SF1) were genotyped and serum biochemical parameters related to uric acid and T2D were determined.SF1 rs606458 showed strong association to T2D in both males and females (p = 0.034 and 0.0008). In the males, LRRC16A was associated with 2-h insulin and insulin secretion (p = 0.009 and 0.009). SLC22A11 was correlated with HOMA-B and insulin secretion (p = 0.048 and 0.029). SLC2A9 rs3775948 was associated with 2-h glucose (p = 0.043). In the females, LRP2 rs2544390 and rs1333049 showed correlations with fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and insulin secretion (p = 0.028, 0.033 and 0.052 and p = 0.034, 0.047 and 0.038, respectively). SLC2A9 rs11722228 was correlated with 2-h glucose, 2-h insulin and insulin secretion (p = 0.024, 0.049 and 0.049, respectively).Our results indicated that the uric acid-associated genes have an impact on the risk of T2D, glucose metabolism and insulin secretion in a Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W2105608541,"Since the formal description of fungi in the genus Escovopsis in 1990, only a few studies have focused on the systematics of this group. For more than two decades, only two Escovopsis species were described; however, in 2013, three additional Escovopsis species were formally described along with the genus Escovopsioides, both found exclusively in attine ant gardens. During a survey for Escovopsis species in gardens of the lower attine ant Mycetophylax morschi in Brazil, we found four strains belonging to the pink-colored Escovopsis clade. Careful examination of these strains revealed significant morphological differences when compared to previously described species of Escovopsis and Escovopsioides. Based on the type of conidiogenesis (sympodial), as well as morphology of conidiogenous cells (percurrent), non-vesiculated conidiophores, and DNA sequences, we describe the four new strains as a new species, Escovopsis kreiselii sp. nov. Phylogenetic analyses using three nuclear markers (Large subunit RNA; translation elongation factor 1-alpha; and internal transcribed spacer) from the new strains as well as available sequences in public databases confirmed that all known fungi infecting attine ant gardens comprise a monophyletic group within the Hypocreaceae family, with very diverse morphological characteristics. Specifically, Escovopsis kreiselii is likely associated with gardens of lower-attine ants and its pathogenicity remains uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W1978235455,"Pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted, multifunctional cytokine, is involved in angiogenic, fibrotic and neurodegenerative diseases. However, little is known about its effects on diabetic retinopathy, a neurovascular disease. To investigate the role of PTN in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), PTN concentration in the vitreous was evaluated in PDR patients and non-diabetic controls. PTN expression was observed in epiretinal membranes from patients. PTN knockdown was performed using small interfering (si)RNA, and the effects on retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and human umbilical vascular endothelia cells (HUVECs) were observed in vitro under hyperglycemic and hypoxic conditions. Cell attachment, proliferation, migration, tube formation, cell cycle, apoptosis, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) phosphorylation, and VEGF levels were studied. The vitreous PTN concentration in PDR patients was higher than that in non-diabetic controls, and PTN was highly expressed in the fibrovascular membranes of PDR patients. Under hyperglycemic and hypoxic conditions, PTN knockdown reduced cell attachment, proliferation, migration, and tube formation and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro. Mechanically, PTN depletion decreased ERK 1/2 phosphorylation. Recombinant PTN up regulated the concentration of VEGF in vitro, which can be attenuated by the ERK 1/2 inhibitor. Taken together, our results implied that elevated PTN in PDR patients might participate in the critical processes of the development of PDR, most likely playing roles in angiogenesis and proliferation, possibly by activating the ERK 1/2 pathway and regulating VEGF secretion. These findings provide new insight into the roles of PTN in PDR and suggest that PTN may become a new target for therapeutic intervention in PDR."
https://openalex.org/W2003437963,"TNFα has been identified as playing an important role in pathologic complications associated with diabetic retinopathy and retinal inflammation, such as retinal leukostasis. However, the transcriptional effects of TNFα on retinal microvascular endothelial cells and the different signaling pathways involved are not yet fully understood. In the present study, RNA-seq was used to profile the transcriptome of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMEC) treated for 4 hours with TNFα in the presence or absence of the NFAT-specific inhibitor INCA-6, in order to gain insight into the specific effects of TNFα on RMEC and identify any involvement of NFAT signaling. Differential expression analysis revealed that TNFα treatment significantly upregulated the expression of 579 genes when compared to vehicle-treated controls, and subsequent pathway analysis revealed a TNFα-induced enrichment of transcripts associated with cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, cell adhesion molecules, and leukocyte transendothelial migration. Differential expression analysis comparing TNFα-treated cells to those co-treated with INCA-6 revealed 10 genes whose expression was significantly reduced by the NFAT inhibitor, including those encoding the proteins VCAM1 and CX3CL1 and cytokines CXCL10 and CXCL11. This study identifies the transcriptional effects of TNFα on HRMEC, highlighting its involvement in multiple pathways that contribute to retinal leukostasis, and identifying a previously unknown role for NFAT-signaling downstream of TNFα."
https://openalex.org/W2050586964,"This study aimed to determine gait ability at hospital discharge in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) as an indicator of the risk of falling. Fifty-seven patients undergoing primary TKA for knee osteoarthritis participated in this study. Gait variability measured with accelerometers and physical function including knee range of motion (ROM), quadriceps strength, walking speed, and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test were evaluated preoperatively and at discharge from the hospital (1 month before and 5 days after surgery). All patients were discharged directly home at 5 days after surgery. Knee flexion of ROM, quadriceps strength, walking speed, and the TUG test results were significantly worse at hospital discharge than preoperatively (p < 0.001). However, gait variability was not significantly different before and after TKA. This result indicated that patients following TKA surgery could walk at hospital discharge as stably as preoperatively regardless of the decrease in physical function, including knee ROM, quadriceps strength, and gait speed after surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2060752969,"Ewing sarcoma is the second most common skeletal (bone and cartilage) cancer in adolescents, and it is characterized by the expression of the aberrant chimeric fusion gene EWS/FLI1. Wild-type EWS has been proposed to play a role in mitosis, splicing and transcription. We have previously shown that EWS/FLI1 interacts with EWS, and it inhibits EWS activity in a dominant manner. Ewing sarcoma is a cancer that specifically develops in skeletal tissues, and although the above data suggests the significance of EWS, its role in chondrogenesis/skeletogenesis is not understood. To elucidate the function of EWS in skeletal development, we generated and analyzed a maternal zygotic (MZ) ewsa/ewsa line because the ewsa/wt and ewsa/ewsa zebrafish appeared to be normal and fertile. Compared with wt/wt, the Meckel’s cartilage of MZ ewsa/ewsa mutants had a higher number of craniofacial prehypertrophic chondrocytes that failed to mature into hypertrophic chondrocytes at 4 days post-fertilization (dpf). Ewsa interacted with Sox9, which is the master transcription factor for chondrogenesis. Sox9 target genes were either upregulated (ctgfa, ctgfb, col2a1a, and col2a1b) or downregulated (sox5, nog1, nog2, and bmp4) in MZ ewsa/ewsa embryos compared with the wt/wt zebrafish embryos. Among these Sox9 target genes, the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiment demonstrated that Ewsa directly binds to ctgfa and ctgfb loci. Consistently, immunohistochemistry showed that the Ctgf protein is upregulated in the Meckel’s cartilage of MZ ewsa/ewsa mutants. Together, we propose that Ewsa promotes the differentiation from prehypertrophic chondrocytes to hypertrophic chondrocytes of Meckel’s cartilage through inhibiting Sox9 binding site of the ctgf gene promoter. Because Ewing sarcoma specifically develops in skeletal tissue that is originating from chondrocytes, this new role of EWS may provide a potential molecular basis of its pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1963847565,"Guidelines for optimized HCV screening are urgently required in Africa, especially for patients infected with HIV, who sometimes show false positive or false negative reactivity in anti-HCV antibody assays. Here, we assessed the usefulness of a fourth-generation HCV Ag-Ab ELISA for the identification of active HCV infection in HIV-positive patients.This cross-sectional study was conducted between 03/2010 and 01/2013 and included 762 Gabonese HIV-positive adult patients. The results of ELISA (Monolisa HCV Ag-Ab ULTRA, Bio-Rad) were compared with those obtained by RT-PCR (gold standard). The optimal ELISA signal-to-cutoff (S/CO) ratio to identify patients with active hepatitis C (positive HCV RNA) was determined. Specimens were further tested by the INNO-LIA HCV Score assay (Innogenetics) and the Architect HCV Ag kit (Abbott) to define the best diagnostic strategy.Sixty-seven patients tested positive for HCV (S/CO ratio ≥ 1) by ELISA. Of these, 47 (70.1%) tested positive for HCV RNA. The optimal S/CO associated with active HCV infection was 1.7. At this threshold, the sensitivity of ELISA was 97.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 90.0-99.9%), its specificity was 91.3% (95% CI 85.0-95.5%), and HCV seroprevalence rate was 7.3% (56/762) (95% CI 5.6-9.4%). Among 57 HCV-seropositive patients with available INNO-LIA results, false reactivity was identified in 14 (24.6%), resolved HCV infection in two (3.5%), possible acute HCV infections in nine (15.8%) and likely chronic HCV infections in 32 (56.1%) patients. HCV core Ag was undetectable in 14/15 (93.3%) specimens that tested negative for HCV RNA whereas it was quantified in 34 (out of 39, 87.2%) samples that tested positive for HCV RNA.Our study provides comprehensive guidance for HCV testing in Gabon, and will help greatly clinicians to improve case definitions for both the notification and surveillance of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV."
https://openalex.org/W1969448500,"Experimental studies regarding coronary embryogenesis suggest that the endocardium is a source of endothelial cells for the myocardial networks. As this was not previously documented in human embryos, we aimed to study whether or not endothelial tip cells could be correlated with endocardial-dependent mechanisms of sprouting angiogenesis. Six human embryos (43–56 days) were obtained and processed in accordance with ethical regulations; immunohistochemistry was performed for CD105 (endoglin), CD31, CD34, α-smooth muscle actin, desmin and vimentin antibodies. Primitive main vessels were found deriving from both the sinus venosus and aorta, and were sought to be the primordia of the venous and arterial ends of cardiac microcirculation. Subepicardial vessels were found branching into the outer ventricular myocardium, with a pattern of recruiting α-SMA+/desmin+ vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes. Endothelial sprouts were guided by CD31+/CD34+/CD105+/vimentin+ endothelial tip cells. Within the inner myocardium, we found endothelial networks rooted from endocardium, guided by filopodia-projecting CD31+/CD34+/CD105+/ vimentin+ endocardial tip cells. The myocardial microcirculatory bed in the atria was mostly originated from endocardium, as well. Nevertheless, endocardial tip cells were also found in cardiac cushions, but they were not related to cushion endothelial networks. A general anatomical pattern of cardiac microvascular embryogenesis was thus hypothesized; the arterial and venous ends being linked, respectively, to the aorta and sinus venosus. Further elongation of the vessels may be related to the epicardium and subepicardial stroma and the intramyocardial network, depending on either endothelial and endocardial filopodia-guided tip cells in ventricles, or mostly on endocardium, in atria."
https://openalex.org/W2011120842,"We have previously found in the chronic SKG mouse model of arthritis that long standing (5 and 8 months) inflammation directly leads to high collagen bone turnover, disorganization of the collagen network, disturbed bone microstructure and degradation of bone biomechanical properties. The main goal of the present work was to study the effects of the first days of the inflammatory process on the microarchitecture and mechanical properties of bone.Twenty eight Wistar adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats were monitored during 22 days after disease induction for the inflammatory score, ankle perimeter and body weight. Healthy non-arthritic rats were used as controls for compar-ison. After 22 days of disease progression rats were sacrificed and bone samples were collected for histomorphometrical, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopical analysis and 3-point bending. Blood samples were also collected for bone turnover markers.AIA rats had an increased bone turnover (as inferred from increased P1NP and CTX1, p = 0.0010 and p = 0.0002, respectively) and this was paralleled by a decreased mineral content (calcium p = 0.0046 and phos-phorus p = 0.0046). Histomorphometry showed a lower trabecular thickness (p = 0.0002) and bone volume (p = 0.0003) and higher trabecular sepa-ration (p = 0.0009) in the arthritic group as compared with controls. In addition, bone mechanical tests showed evidence of fragility as depicted by diminished values of yield stress and ultimate fracture point (p = 0.0061 and p = 0.0279, re-spectively) in the arthritic group.We have shown in an AIA rat model that arthritis induc-es early bone high turnover, structural degradation, mineral loss and mechanical weak-ness."
https://openalex.org/W1970788165,"Previous genetic studies on colorectal carcinomas (CRC) have identified multiple somatic mutations in four candidate pathways (TGF-β, Wnt, P53 and RTK-RAS pathways) on populations of European ancestry. However, it is under-studied whether other populations harbor different sets of hot-spot somatic mutations in these pathways and other oncogenes. In this study, to evaluate the mutational spectrum of novel somatic mutations, we assessed 41 pairs of tumor-stroma tissues from Chinese patients with CRC, including 29 colon carcinomas and 12 rectal carcinomas. We designed Illumina Custom Amplicon panel to target 43 genes, including genes in the four candidate pathways, as well as several known oncogenes for other cancers. Candidate mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing, and we further used SIFT and PolyPhen-2 to assess potentially functional mutations. We discovered 3 new somatic mutations in gene APC, TCF7L2, and PIK3CA that had never been reported in the COSMIC or NCI-60 databases. Additionally, we confirmed 6 known somatic mutations in gene SMAD4, APC, FBXW7, BRAF and PTEN in Chinese CRC patients. While most were previously reported in CRC, one mutation in PTEN was reported only in malignant endometrium cancer. Our study confirmed the existence of known somatic mutations in the four candidate pathways for CRC in Chinese patients. We also discovered a number of novel somatic mutations in these pathways, which may have implications for the pathogenesis of CRC."
https://openalex.org/W1991548419,"Integrins play an essential role in hemostasis, thrombosis, and cell migration, and they transmit bidirectional signals. Transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains are hypothesized to associate in the resting integrins; whereas, ligand binding and intracellular activating signals induce transmembrane domain separation. However, how this conformational change affects integrin outside-in signaling and whether the α subunit cytoplasmic domain is important for this signaling remain elusive. Using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells that stably expressed different integrin αIIbβ3 constructs, we discovered that an αIIb cytoplasmic domain truncation led to integrin activation but not defective outside-in signaling. In contrast, preventing transmembrane domain separation abolished both inside-out and outside-in signaling regardless of removing the αIIb cytoplasmic tail. Truncation of the αIIb cytoplasmic tail did not obviously affect adhesion-induced outside-in signaling. Our research revealed that transmembrane domain separation is a downstream conformational change after the cytoplasmic domain dissociation in inside-out activation and indispensable for ligand-induced outside-in signaling. The result implicates that the β TM helix rearrangement after dissociation is essential for integrin transmembrane signaling. Furthermore, we discovered that the PI3K/Akt pathway is not essential for cell spreading but spreading-induced Erk1/2 activation is PI3K dependent implicating requirement of the kinase for cell survival in outside-in signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2033009395,"Ropivacaine is a local anesthetic widely used for regional anesthesia and epidural analgesia, but its relatively short duration limits its clinical use. A novel sustained release lipid formulation of ropivacaine has been recently developed to prolong its duration. We examined the epidural anti-hypersensitivity and preemptive effects of ropivacaine in mesylate injection and sustained release suspension forms in a rat model of neuropathy produced by peripheral nerve injury. Epidural administration of ropivacaine mesylate injection specifically blocked mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia by approximately 50% with a biological half-effective duration of approximately 3 hrs. The equivalent dose of ropivacaine free-base in sustained release suspension significantly prolonged the duration of anti-allodynia and anti-hyperalgesia by approximately 2 times. Multiple daily epidural injections of ropivacaine in both the mesylate injection and sustained-release suspension forms did not induce tolerance or potentiation to anti-allodynia or anti-hyperalgesia. Moreover, the single or multiple daily administration of ropivacaine mesylate injection before surgery in particular, markedly blocked the initiation and development of neuropathic pain, increasing the biological half-effective duration from less than 4 hrs up to 1 or 2 days. The single and multiple daily epidural injection of ropivacaine sustained release suspension further delayed the biological half-lives to 2 and 3 days, respectively. Our results indicate that the epidural administration of ropivacaine effectively blocks neuropathic pain without the induction of analgesic tolerance, and significantly delays the development of neuropathy produced by peripheral nerve injury. Epidural ropivacaine sustained release suspension produces much longer blockade effects of mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia, and more significantly delays the development of neuropathic pain."

Human DNA helicase B (HDHB) is a robust 5′-3′ DNA helicase which accumulates on chromatin in cells exposed to DNA damage. HDHB facilitates cellular recovery from replication stress, but its role in DNA damage response remains unclear. Here we report that HDHB silencing results in reduced sister chromatid exchange, impaired homologous recombination repair, and delayed RPA late-stage foci formation induced by ionizing radiation. Ectopically expressed HDHB colocalizes with Rad51, Rad52, RPA, and ssDNA. In vitro, HDHB stimulates Rad51-mediated heteroduplex extension in 5′-3′ direction. A helicase-defective mutant HDHB failed to promote this reaction. Our studies implicate HDHB promotes homologous recombination in vivo and stimulates 5′-3′ heteroduplex extension during Rad51-mediated strand exchange in vitro."

However, the genetic characteristics of circulating isolates are unknown. Phenotypic and molecular profiles of 60 S. flexneri isolates recovered in Guizhou between 1972 to 1982 and 2008 to 2010 were determined. Nine serotypes (1a, 2a, 3a, 1b, 2b, X, Y, 4av and Yv) were identified. Multi-locus sequence typing differentiated the isolates into 20 sequence types (STs); 18 were novel. Four STs, ST 129, ST 100, ST 126 and ST 18, were most abundant, accounting for 65% of the isolates. Thirty-nine NotI-pulsed field gel electrophoresis patterns (pulsotypes, PTs) were observed; eight PTs were represented by more than one isolate with six isolates sharing the PT 13 profile. Multi-locus variable-nucleotide tandem-repeat analysis recognized 44 different types (MTs); seven MTs were represented by more than one isolate and MT 1 was most commonly encountered. Correlation between genetic relationships and serotypes was observed among the isolates studied; the majority of isolates belonging to the same serotype from different years clustered together based on the molecular data. These clustered isolates were also from similar geographical origins. These results enhance our understanding of genetic relationships between S. flexneri in Guizhou Province and can be used to help understand the changing etiology of shigellosis in China."
https://openalex.org/W1995999240,"Despite the recent advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), MM patients with high-risk cytogenetic changes such as t(4;14) translocation or deletion of chromosome 17 still have extremely poor prognoses. With the goal of helping these high-risk MM patients, we previously developed a novel phthalimide derivative, TC11. Here we report the further characterization of TC11 including anti-myeloma effects in vitro and in vivo, a pharmacokinetic study in mice, and anti-osteoclastogenic activity. Intraperitoneal injections of TC11 significantly delayed the growth of subcutaneous tumors in human myeloma-bearing SCID mice. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that TC11 induced apoptosis of MM cells in vivo. In the pharmacokinetic analyses, the Cmax was 2.1 μM at 1 h after the injection of TC11, with 1.2 h as the half-life. TC11 significantly inhibited the differentiation and function of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated osteoclasts in mouse osteoclast cultures using M-CSF and RANKL. We also revealed that TC11 induced the apoptosis of myeloma cells accompanied by α-tubulin fragmentation. In addition, TC11 and lenalidomide, another phthalimide derivative, directly bound to nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), whose role in MM is unknown. Thus, through multiple molecular interactions, TC11 is a potentially effective drug for high-risk MM patients with bone lesions. The present results suggest the possibility of the further development of novel thalidomide derivatives by drug designing."

About 60% of patients with PMF harbor a somatic mutation of the JAK2 gene (JAK2-V617F) in their hematopoietic lineage. Recently, a splicing isoform of JAK2, lacking exon 14 (JAK2Δ14) was described in patients affected by myeloproliferative diseases. Materials and Methods By using a specific RT-qPCR method, we measured the ratio between the splicing isoform and the JAK2 full-length transcript (JAK2+14) in granulocytes, isolated from peripheral blood, of forty-four patients with PMF and nine healthy donors. Results We found that JAK2Δ14 was only slightly increased in patients and, at variance with published data, the splicing isoform was also detectable in healthy controls. We also found that, in patients bearing the JAK2-V617F mutation, the percentage of mutated alleles correlated with the observed increase in JAK2Δ14. Homozygosity for the mutation was also associated with a higher level of JAK2+14. Bioinformatic analysis indicates the possibility that the G>T transversion may interfere with the correct splicing of exon 14 by modifying a splicing regulatory sequence. Conclusions Increased levels of JAK2 full-length transcript and a small but significant increase in JAK2 exon 14 skipping, are associated with the JAK2-V617F allele burden in PMF granulocytes. Our data do not confirm a previous claim that the production of the JAK2Δ14 isoform is related to the pathogenesis of PMF."

Design Subcutaneous fat biopsies were obtained before, at 6- and 18–24-months after treatment, and from HIV negative controls. Groups were age, ethnicity, weight, biochemical profile, and pre-treatment CD4 count matched. Microarray data was generated using the Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarray. Identification of differentially expressed genes and genomic response pathways was performed using limma and gene set enrichment analysis. Results There were significant divergences between ABC and the other two groups 6 months after treatment in genes controlling cell adhesion and environmental information processing, with some convergence at 18–24 months. Compared to controls the ABC group, but not AZT or TDF showed enrichment of genes controlling adherence junction, at 6 months and 18–24 months (adjusted p<0.05) and focal adhesions and tight junction at 6 months (p<0.5). Genes controlling leukocyte transendothelial migration (p<0.05) and ECM-receptor interactions (p = 0.04) were over-expressed in ABC compared to TDF and AZT at 6 months but not at 18–24 months. Enrichment of pathways and individual genes controlling cell adhesion and environmental information processing were specifically dysregulated in the ABC group in comparison with other treatments. There was little difference between AZT and TDF. Conclusion After initiating treatment, there is divergence in the expression of genes controlling cell adhesion and environmental information processing between ABC and both TDF and AZT in subcutaneous adipose tissue. If similar changes are also taking place in other tissues including the coronary vasculature they may contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular events reported in patients recently started on abacavir-containing regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2036856281,"Luteinizing hormone (LH) is synthesized and secreted throughout the reproductive cycle from gonadotrope cells in the anterior pituitary, and is required for steroidogenesis and ovulation. LH contains an α-subunit common with FSH, and a unique LHβ subunit that defines biological activity. Basal LHβ transcription is low and stimulated by hypothalamic GnRH, which induces synthesis of early growth response protein-1 (Egr1), and stimulates binding of transcription factors Egr1 and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1) on the promoter. WT1 (Wilms tumor protein1) is a zinc finger transcription factor with an essential role in urogenital system development, and which regulates several reproductive genes via interactions with SF1 or binding to GC-rich elements such as Egr1 binding sites. We investigated a potential role for WT1 in LHβ transcription in clonal mouse gonadotrope LβT2 cells. WT1 was present in LβT2 and mouse pituitary cells, and protein bound to the endogenous LHβ promoter. Interestingly, mRNAs for WT1(+KTS), which contains a three amino-acid insertion between the 3rd and 4th zinc fingers, and the WT1 (-KTS) variant were both expressed at significant levels. WT1 mRNAs and protein were decreased approximately 50% by GnRH treatment, under conditions where Egr1 mRNA and protein, and LHβ transcription, were stimulated. Decreasing expression of mRNA for WT1 (-KTS) decreased stimulation of LHβ and Egr1 by GnRH, whereas decreasing both WT1 (-KTS) and (+KTS) increased endogenous LHβ transcription, and prevented LHβ but not Egr1 stimulation by GnRH, suggesting differing biological activities for the WT1 isoforms. Overexpression of WT1 showed that WT1(-KTS) enhanced LHβ promoter GnRH stimulation 2-to-3-fold and required the 3’Egr1 site, but WT1(+KTS) repressed both basal and GnRH-stimulated LHβ promoter activity by approximately 70%. Our data suggest that WT1 can modulate LHβ transcription, with differential roles for the two WT1 variants; WT1 (-KTS) enhances and WT1 (+KTS) suppresses transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2165012809,"A century ago, in his study of colour vision in the honeybee (Apis mellifera), Karl von Frisch showed that bees distinguish between a disc that is half yellow, half blue, and a mirror image of the same. Although his inference of colour vision in this example has been accepted, some discrepancies have prompted a new investigation of the detection of polarity in coloured patterns. In new experiments, bees restricted to their blue and green receptors by exclusion of ultraviolet could learn patterns of this type if they displayed a difference in green contrast between the two colours. Patterns with no green contrast required an additional vertical black line as a landmark. Tests of the trained bees revealed that they had learned two inputs; a measure and the retinotopic position of blue with large field tonic detectors, and the measure and position of a vertical edge or line with small-field phasic green detectors. The angle between these two was measured. This simple combination was detected wherever it occurred in many patterns, fitting the definition of an algorithm, which is defined as a method of processing data. As long as they excited blue receptors, colours could be any colour to human eyes, even white. The blue area cue could be separated from the green receptor modulation by as much as 50°. When some blue content was not available, the bees learned two measures of the modulation of the green receptors at widely separated vertical edges, and the angle between them. There was no evidence that the bees reconstructed the lay-out of the pattern or detected a tonic input to the green receptors."
