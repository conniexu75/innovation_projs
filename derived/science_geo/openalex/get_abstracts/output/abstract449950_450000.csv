https://openalex.org/W2154911070,"Increased salt concentrations are shown to induce murine and human TH17 cells by a mechanism that depends on activation of p38/MAPK, NFAT5 and SGK1; mice kept on a high-salt diet develop a more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis due to increased induction of TH17 cells. Two independent groups have come to the same surprising conclusion: that increased salt concentrations promote autoimmune disease by stimulating the production of interleukin-17-producing helper T (TH17) cells from CD4+ T cells. Chuan Wu et al. show that increases in salt concentrations induce serum glucocorticoid kinase 1 (SGK1) in T cells and enhance TH17 differentiation in vitro and in vivo in mice. Markus Kleinewietfeld et al. find that salt induces murine and human TH17 cells by a mechanism dependent on activation of SGK1 and the p38 MAP kinase/NFAT5 pathway. Mice on a high-salt diet develop a more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for brain inflammation, owing to high numbers of infiltrating TH17 cells. These studies raise the possibility that high salt intake might trigger tissue inflammation and autoimmune disease in humans. A further paper from Nir Yosef et al. presents a global view of the gene networks regulating TH17 cell differentiation. There has been a marked increase in the incidence of autoimmune diseases in the past half-century. Although the underlying genetic basis of this class of diseases has recently been elucidated, implicating predominantly immune-response genes1, changes in environmental factors must ultimately be driving this increase. The newly identified population of interleukin (IL)-17-producing CD4+ helper T cells (TH17 cells) has a pivotal role in autoimmune diseases2. Pathogenic IL-23-dependent TH17 cells have been shown to be critical for the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis, and genetic risk factors associated with multiple sclerosis are related to the IL-23–TH17 pathway1,2. However, little is known about the environmental factors that directly influence TH17 cells. Here we show that increased salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) concentrations found locally under physiological conditions in vivo markedly boost the induction of murine and human TH17 cells. High-salt conditions activate the p38/MAPK pathway involving nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5; also called TONEBP) and serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) during cytokine-induced TH17 polarization. Gene silencing or chemical inhibition of p38/MAPK, NFAT5 or SGK1 abrogates the high-salt-induced TH17 cell development. The TH17 cells generated under high-salt conditions display a highly pathogenic and stable phenotype characterized by the upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines GM-CSF, TNF-α and IL-2. Moreover, mice fed with a high-salt diet develop a more severe form of EAE, in line with augmented central nervous system infiltrating and peripherally induced antigen-specific TH17 cells. Thus, increased dietary salt intake might represent an environmental risk factor for the development of autoimmune diseases through the induction of pathogenic TH17 cells."

Two independent groups have come to the same surprising conclusion: that increased salt concentrations promote autoimmune disease by stimulating the production of interleukin-17-producing helper T (TH17) cells from CD4+ T cells. Chuan Wu et al. show that increases in salt concentrations induce serum glucocorticoid kinase 1 (SGK1) in T cells and enhance TH17 differentiation in vitro and in vivo in mice.

These studies raise the possibility that high salt intake might trigger tissue inflammation and autoimmune disease in humans. A further paper from Nir Yosef et al. presents a global view of the gene networks regulating TH17 cell differentiation. TH17 cells (interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing helper T cells) are highly proinflammatory cells that are critical for clearing extracellular pathogens and for inducing multiple autoimmune diseases1. IL-23 has a critical role in stabilizing and reinforcing the TH17 phenotype by increasing expression of IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) and endowing TH17 cells with pathogenic effector functions2,3. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which IL-23 sustains the TH17 response and induces pathogenic effector functions has not been elucidated. Here we used transcriptional profiling of developing TH17 cells to construct a model of their signalling network and nominate major nodes that regulate TH17 development. We identified serum glucocorticoid kinase 1 (SGK1), a serine/threonine kinase4, as an essential node downstream of IL-23 signalling. SGK1 is critical for regulating IL-23R expression and stabilizing the TH17 cell phenotype by deactivation of mouse Foxo1, a direct repressor of IL-23R expression. SGK1 has been shown to govern Na+ transport and salt (NaCl) homeostasis in other cells5,6,7,8. We show here that a modest increase in salt concentration induces SGK1 expression, promotes IL-23R expression and enhances TH17 cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo, accelerating the development of autoimmunity. Loss of SGK1 abrogated Na+-mediated TH17 differentiation in an IL-23-dependent manner. These data demonstrate that SGK1 has a critical role in the induction of pathogenic TH17 cells and provide a molecular insight into a mechanism by which an environmental factor such as a high salt diet triggers TH17 development and promotes tissue inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2102158172,"Despite their importance, the molecular circuits that control the differentiation of naive T cells remain largely unknown. Recent studies that reconstructed regulatory networks in mammalian cells have focused on short-term responses and relied on perturbation-based approaches that cannot be readily applied to primary T cells. Here we combine transcriptional profiling at high temporal resolution, novel computational algorithms, and innovative nanowire-based perturbation tools to systematically derive and experimentally validate a model of the dynamic regulatory network that controls the differentiation of mouse TH17 cells, a proinflammatory T-cell subset that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases. The TH17 transcriptional network consists of two self-reinforcing, but mutually antagonistic, modules, with 12 novel regulators, the coupled action of which may be essential for maintaining the balance between TH17 and other CD4+ T-cell subsets. Our study identifies and validates 39 regulatory factors, embeds them within a comprehensive temporal network and reveals its organizational principles; it also highlights novel drug targets for controlling TH17 cell differentiation. A global view of the genetic networks regulating the differentiation of TH17 cells is presented, based on temporal expression profiling, computational network reconstruction and validation of predicted interactions by nanowire-mediated siRNA perturbation. This paper presents a global view of the gene networks regulating interleukin-17-producing helper T (TH17) cell differentiation. Transcriptional profiling, computational algorithms and a novel technique using silicon nanowires to manipulate genes in primary T cells, are used to build a detailed picture of the complex network that controls TH17 differentiation and keeps the pro-inflammatory potential of TH17 cells in check. The study identifies and validates 39 regulatory factors and highlights novel drug targets for controlling TH17 cell differentiation. Elsewhere in this issue, two groups present the surprising finding that increased salt concentrations promote autoimmune disease by stimulating the production of TH17 cells from CD4+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2040481510,"In the era of precision cosmology it is essential to determine the Hubble Constant with an accuracy of 3% or better. Currently, its uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) which as the second nearest galaxy serves as the best anchor point of the cosmic distance scale. Observations of eclipsing binaries offer a unique opportunity to precisely and accurately measure stellar parameters and distances. The eclipsing binary method was previously applied to the LMC but the accuracy of the distance results was hampered by the need to model the bright, early-type systems used in these studies. Here, we present distance determinations to eight long-period, late- type eclipsing systems in the LMC composed of cool giant stars. For such systems we can accurately measure both the linear and angular sizes of their components and avoid the most important problems related to the hot early-type systems. Our LMC distance derived from these systems is demonstrably accurate to 2.2 % (49.97 +/- 0.19 (statistical) +/- 1.11 (systematic) kpc) providing a firm base for a 3 % determination of the Hubble Constant, with prospects for improvement to 2 % in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2076498407,"Natural epigenetic variation provides a source for the generation of phenotypic diversity, but to understand its contribution to such diversity, its interaction with genetic variation requires further investigation. Here we report population-wide DNA sequencing of genomes, transcriptomes and methylomes of wild Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Single cytosine methylation polymorphisms are not linked to genotype. However, the rate of linkage disequilibrium decay amongst differentially methylated regions targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation is similar to the rate for single nucleotide polymorphisms. Association analyses of these RNA-directed DNA methylation regions with genetic variants identified thousands of methylation quantitative trait loci, which revealed the population estimate of genetically dependent methylation variation. Analysis of invariably methylated transposons and genes across this population indicates that loci targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation are epigenetically activated in pollen and seeds, which facilitates proper development of these structures. A population epigenomic analysis of wild Arabidopsis thaliana accessions is presented, obtained by sequencing their whole genomes, methylomes and transcriptomes; thousands of DNA methylation variants are identified, some of which are associated with methylation quantitative trait loci. Like natural genetic variation, natural epigenetic variation — heritable alterations in gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in DNA sequence —is a source of phenotypic diversity. How epigenetic variants form and how genetic variation is linked to epigenetic variation at the population level, however, has been little studied. These authors present the first whole-genome, base-resolution, population-level epigenomic analysis by sequencing the genomes, methylomes and transcriptomes of a population of more than 150 accessions of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana isolated from across the Northern Hemisphere. Thousands of DNA-methylation variants were identified, many of them linked to genetic variants. The analyses also reveal that genes targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation may have co-opted a mechanism that silences transposons to maintain their silenced state in vegetative tissues and to ensure correct expression in pollen, seed and germ line development."
https://openalex.org/W2067960353,"Recognition of sweet, bitter and umami tastes requires the non-vesicular release from taste bud cells of ATP, which acts as a neurotransmitter to activate afferent neural gustatory pathways. However, how ATP is released to fulfil this function is not fully understood. Here we show that calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1), a voltage-gated ion channel, is indispensable for taste-stimuli-evoked ATP release from sweet-, bitter- and umami-sensing taste bud cells. Calhm1 knockout mice have severely impaired perceptions of sweet, bitter and umami compounds, whereas their recognition of sour and salty tastes remains mostly normal. Calhm1 deficiency affects taste perception without interfering with taste cell development or integrity. CALHM1 is expressed specifically in sweet/bitter/umami-sensing type II taste bud cells. Its heterologous expression induces a novel ATP permeability that releases ATP from cells in response to manipulations that activate the CALHM1 ion channel. Knockout of Calhm1 strongly reduces voltage-gated currents in type II cells and taste-evoked ATP release from taste buds without affecting the excitability of taste cells by taste stimuli. Thus, CALHM1 is a voltage-gated ATP-release channel required for sweet, bitter and umami taste perception."
https://openalex.org/W2054002500,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States, but its pathogenesis is poorly understood. Some epithelial cancers are known to occur in transitional zones between two types of epithelium, whereas others have been shown to originate in epithelial tissue stem cells. The stem cell niche of the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), which is ruptured and regenerates during ovulation, has not yet been defined unequivocally. Here we identify the hilum region of the mouse ovary, the transitional (or junction) area between the OSE, mesothelium and tubal (oviductal) epithelium, as a previously unrecognized stem cell niche of the OSE. We find that cells of the hilum OSE are cycling slowly and express stem and/or progenitor cell markers ALDH1, LGR5, LEF1, CD133 and CK6B. These cells display long-term stem cell properties ex vivo and in vivo, as shown by our serial sphere generation and long-term lineage-tracing assays. Importantly, the hilum cells show increased transformation potential after inactivation of tumour suppressor genes Trp53 and Rb1, whose pathways are altered frequently in the most aggressive and common type of human EOC, high-grade serous adenocarcinoma. Our study supports experimentally the idea that susceptibility of transitional zones to malignant transformation may be explained by the presence of stem cell niches in those areas. Identification of a stem cell niche for the OSE may have important implications for understanding EOC pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2016918012,"In complex networks such as gene networks, traffic systems or brain circuits it is important to understand how long it takes for the different parts of the network to effectively influence one another. In the brain, for example, axonal delays between brain areas can amount to several tens of milliseconds, adding an intrinsic component to any timing-based processing of information. Inferring neural interaction delays is thus needed to interpret the information transfer revealed by any analysis of directed interactions across brain structures. However, a robust estimation of interaction delays from neural activity faces several challenges if modeling assumptions on interaction mechanisms are wrong or cannot be made. Here, we propose a robust estimator for neuronal interaction delays rooted in an information-theoretic framework, which allows a model-free exploration of interactions. In particular, we extend transfer entropy to account for delayed source-target interactions, while crucially retaining the conditioning on the embedded target state at the immediately previous time step. We prove that this particular extension is indeed guaranteed to identify interaction delays between two coupled systems and is the only relevant option in keeping with Wiener's principle of causality. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in detecting interaction delays on finite data by numerical simulations of stochastic and deterministic processes, as well as on local field potential recordings. We also show the ability of the extended transfer entropy to detect the presence of multiple delays, as well as feedback loops. While evaluated on neuroscience data, we expect the estimator to be useful in other fields dealing with network dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2001755389,"Forecasting technological progress is of great interest to engineers, policy makers, and private investors. Several models have been proposed for predicting technological improvement, but how well do these models perform? An early hypothesis made by Theodore Wright in 1936 is that cost decreases as a power law of cumulative production. An alternative hypothesis is Moore's law, which can be generalized to say that technologies improve exponentially with time. Other alternatives were proposed by Goddard, Sinclair et al., and Nordhaus. These hypotheses have not previously been rigorously tested. Using a new database on the cost and production of 62 different technologies, which is the most expansive of its kind, we test the ability of six different postulated laws to predict future costs. Our approach involves hindcasting and developing a statistical model to rank the performance of the postulated laws. Wright's law produces the best forecasts, but Moore's law is not far behind. We discover a previously unobserved regularity that production tends to increase exponentially. A combination of an exponential decrease in cost and an exponential increase in production would make Moore's law and Wright's law indistinguishable, as originally pointed out by Sahal. We show for the first time that these regularities are observed in data to such a degree that the performance of these two laws is nearly tied. Our results show that technological progress is forecastable, with the square root of the logarithmic error growing linearly with the forecasting horizon at a typical rate of 2.5% per year. These results have implications for theories of technological change, and assessments of candidate technologies and policies for climate change mitigation."
https://openalex.org/W2003444365,"In wound healing, tissue growth, and certain cancers, the epithelial or the endothelial monolayer sheet expands. Within the expanding monolayer sheet, migration of the individual cell is strongly guided by physical forces imposed by adjacent cells. This process is called plithotaxis and was discovered using Monolayer Stress Microscopy (MSM). MSM rests upon certain simplifying assumptions, however, concerning boundary conditions, cell material properties and system dimensionality. To assess the validity of these assumptions and to quantify associated errors, here we report new analytical, numerical, and experimental investigations. For several commonly used experimental monolayer systems, the simplifying assumptions used previously lead to errors that are shown to be quite small. Out-of-plane components of displacement and traction fields can be safely neglected, and characteristic features of intercellular stresses that underlie plithotaxis remain largely unaffected. Taken together, these findings validate Monolayer Stress Microscopy within broad but well-defined limits of applicability."

In these studies we have examined the role of physiologically relevant levels of MIC-1/GDF15 in the regulation of appetite, body weight and basal metabolic rate. MIC-1/GDF15 gene knockout mice (MIC-1−/−) weighed more and had increased adiposity, which was associated with increased spontaneous food intake. Female MIC-1−/− mice exhibited some additional alterations in reduced basal energy expenditure and physical activity, possibly owing to the associated decrease in total lean mass. Further, infusion of human recombinant MIC-1/GDF15 sufficient to raise serum levels in MIC-1−/− mice to within the normal human range reduced body weight and food intake. Taken together, our findings suggest that MIC-1/GDF15 is involved in the physiological regulation of appetite and energy storage."
https://openalex.org/W2007394221,"An important challenge for oncologists is to treat overt metastasis, the major source of cancer-related deaths1. Adjuvant therapy should prevent distant recurrences by targeting residual disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) that give origin to metastasis, as well as existing undetected micrometastasis. Whereas in some cases, such as breast cancer, patients can show delayed metastasis after hormonal therapies (for example, in estrogen receptor–positive tumors) or treatment with trastuzumab, for HER2 (also called ERBB2)-positive tumors2, adjuvant therapy is for the most part ineffective in fully blocking metastasis development and improving overall survival.

This may be explained by the fact that the biology of residual DTCs seems to diverge from that of the primary tumors and overt metastasis3. The usually unpredictable timing of metastasis can be due to the ability of DTCs to enter dormancy1. Dormant DTCs can in turn be refractory to targeted or conventional therapies2, further limiting treatment responses. Notably, more than 67% of deaths in patients with breast cancer occur after the 5-year survival mark, showing that residual disease can be dormant for very long periods1. This further argues that targeting dormant DTCs is crucial. Unfortunately, compared to other areas of cancer, our understanding of the biology of dormant residual DTCs is highly limited. Thus, `bedside' clinical management of dormant disease will be a reality only after rigorous understanding of its molecular and cellular basis.

There is compelling evidence that the presence of DTCs in the bone marrow of patients with breast or other cancers is a poor prognosis indicator1. However, although some DTC-positive patients recur 3 years after surgery, others do so up to a decade later1. Characterization of DTCs from patients may be the shortest path to determine which and when patients might relapse and identify DTC-specific mechanisms to target. A study in esophageal cancer showed that direct genetic analysis of DTCs predicted outcome and therapy selection3. An amplification of the region harboring HER2 was found in the primary tumors and DTCs; however, the HER2 amplification was only predictive of poor patient survival when detected in disseminated tumor cells. Notably, esophageal tumor cell lines with HER2 amplification were sensitive to commonly used therapies designed for breast cancer (for example, trastuzumab)3.

DTCs in the bone marrow of patients are largely nonproliferative2 and DTCs—but not circulating tumor cells—can persist in the target organs for long periods (up to a decade)1, suggesting that DTCs probably enter cellular dormancy through quiescence2. Although eradicating dormant DTCs or keeping them dormant could be a new strategy to prevent metastasis2, achievement of such a goal in the clinic requires answering at least two important questions. First, can DTCs serve as a biomarker when typified during recurrence or dormancy? And second, can we identify dormant DTC-specific or microenvironment-dependent mechanisms that could be manipulated to maintain or eradicate dormant disease?

Microenvironmental signals that cause a low-mitogenic and high-stress signaling and trigger quiescence may constitute dormancy mechanisms2,4,5. For instance, blockade of the urokinase receptor (uPAR) inhibits fibronectin-dependent mitogenic signaling by reducing the activation of α5β1 integrin and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)2, resulting in extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) deactivation and subsequent p38 activation, which further antagonizes ERK to induce quiescence2,4. Interestingly, uPARlow/− DTCs in the bone marrow of patients with gastric carcinoma were associated with longer disease-free survival4, suggesting that this mechanism could induce DTC dormancy. Along these lines, high-density collagen (fibrotic) microenvironments in the lungs and liver promote exit from dormancy by activating ERK signaling2. These data suggest that reciprocal tumor-stroma crosstalk can regulate dormancy.

More recently, bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP7) in the bone marrow was shown to trigger dormancy of prostate DTCs by activating p38 signaling, upregulating the metastasis suppressor gene NRDG1 and inducing reversible growth arrest5. Also, the lysophosphatidic acid receptor EDG2 has been identified as a breast cancer metastasis promoter6, and its pharmacological inhibition induced dormancy of solitary or micrometastatic lesions through activation of p38 signaling6. Recently, the BMP4 inhibitor COCO (also known as DAND5) was found to prevent the onset of solitary-cell dormancy of 4T1 tumor cells by activating a self-renewal program and restricting quiescence7. These data suggest that microenvironment- and DTC-specific markers may be needed to identify DTCs and their tissue milieu as pro-dormancy. This also offers markers beyond proliferation regulators (such as Ki-67 and p21cip1) to stage DTCs and host microenvironments as prone to dormancy or recurrence (Fig. 1).

How can this be applied in the clinic to identify patients with dormant disease? Translational studies have focused mostly on using gene expression profiles in primary tumors and dormancy-associated genes to predict metastasis-free survival. For example, both BMP7high- and COCOlow-associated signatures predicted delayed metastasis to bone and lung in prostate and breast cancer, respectively5,7. Also, a study of individuals with estrogen receptor-positive primary breast tumors that were enriched in p38-induced and angiogenic dormancy gene signatures showed delayed time to metastasis8. Interestingly, several genes included in these dormancy signatures8 can limit self renewal (NR2F1 and TGFB2 (ref. 9)), predict delayed recurrence in breast and prostate cancer (NR2F1 and SHARP1 (also called BHLHE41)2,10), induce tumor cell quiescence (p38 (ref. 11)) and suppress breast cancer metastasis (SHARP1 (ref. 2)). If tested on DTCs in patients, these new markers could produce a set of clinically testable dormancy markers.

Whereas an analysis of `dormancy signatures' may inform about the time to metastasis, only molecular and phenotypic characterization of DTCs will allow weighing their prognostic and staging value for dormant disease. But in what clinical setting could DTC isolation and dormancy profiling become useful? Ideally, they should be useful in the adjuvant setting, during asymptomatic stages of the disease or both (Fig. 1). However, this might require yearly follow up for long periods (more than 5 years). This is a difficult task, as patients may be deemed cured or not closely followed. Whereas this strategy may require a change in clinical monitoring and research, a new clinical trial scenario may allow for the determination of whether DTC profiling is informative12. In phase 2 trials, time to the first metastasis and time to a new metastasis could be potential measures for dormancy12; detection of recurrence markers in DTCs in this temporal window may allow correlating DTC phenotype with therapy response (Fig. 1).

Epigenetics drugs (such as 5-azacitidine or histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors) can induce low self-renewal states by regulating similar dormancy pathways2,8,11,13. Thus, these drugs, along with inhibitors or activators of other metastasis-related targets such as lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (EDG2, also called LPAR1) antagonists6 or BMP7 (ref. 5), could be used as a strategy to reprogram residual disease into dormancy. Targeting dormancy-specific survival mechanisms, such as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 α kinase 3 (PERK, also called EIF2AK3), chaperone heat shock 70-kDa protein 5 (GRP78, also called HSPA5) or c-Src2,14, could be used to eradicate DTCs. We envision that therapies that induce or maintain dormancy of DTCs followed by or combined with other drugs that block survival mechanisms may be successful in the treatment of dormant residual disease (Fig. 1). As the dormancy mechanisms become clearer, translational efforts will be key. This will require a close relationship between physicians and researchers to correlate marker detection with patient outcome and the design of new trials. Despite the challenges posed by this approach, the benefits would be so substantial that it only makes sense to push these studies further and make this therapeutic window of opportunity one that can be offered safely to patients."
https://openalex.org/W2083711669,"Rapid and effective host responses keep herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) at bay, preventing genital mucosa lesions. However, periodic shedding and frequent reactivation of the latent virus allow for silent transmission, posing a challenge to virus elimination. The rapid clearance of HSV-2 in the genital mucosa by resident and virus-specific immune cells that persist in the mucosa suggests new ways to harness the immune system to develop effective therapies. Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) is periodically shed throughout the human genital tract. Although a high viral load correlates with the development of genital ulcers, shedding also commonly occurs even when ulcers are absent, allowing for silent transmission during coitus and contributing to high seroprevalence of HSV-2 worldwide. Frequent viral reactivation occurs within ganglia despite diverse and complementary host and viral mechanisms that predispose toward latency, suggesting that viral replication may be constantly occurring in a small minority of neurons at these sites. Within genital mucosa, the in vivo expansion and clearance rates of HSV-2 are extremely rapid. Resident dendritic cells and memory HSV-2 specific T cells persist at prior sites of genital tract reactivation and, in conjunction with prompt innate recognition of infected cells, lead to rapid containment of infected cells. The fact that immune responses usually control viral replication in genital skin before lesions develop provides hope that enhancing such responses could lead to effective vaccines and immunotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W1983566676,"Fear conditioning is relevant for elucidating the pathophysiology of anxiety, but may also be useful in the context of chronic pain syndromes which often overlap with anxiety. Thus far, no fear conditioning studies have employed aversive visceral stimuli from the lower gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, we implemented a fear conditioning paradigm to analyze the conditioned response to rectal pain stimuli using fMRI during associative learning, extinction and reinstatement. In N = 21 healthy humans, visual conditioned stimuli (CS+) were paired with painful rectal distensions as unconditioned stimuli (US), while different visual stimuli (CS−) were presented without US. During extinction, all CSs were presented without US, whereas during reinstatement, a single, unpaired US was presented. In region-of-interest analyses, conditioned anticipatory neural activation was assessed along with perceived CS-US contingency and CS unpleasantness. Fear conditioning resulted in significant contingency awareness and valence change, i.e., learned unpleasantness of a previously neutral stimulus. This was paralleled by anticipatory activation of the anterior cingulate cortex, the somatosensory cortex and precuneus (all during early acquisition) and the amygdala (late acquisition) in response to the CS+. During extinction, anticipatory activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to the CS− was observed. In the reinstatement phase, a tendency for parahippocampal activation was found. Fear conditioning with rectal pain stimuli is feasible and leads to learned unpleasantness of previously neutral stimuli. Within the brain, conditioned anticipatory activations are seen in core areas of the central fear network including the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex. During extinction, conditioned responses quickly disappear, and learning of new predictive cue properties is paralleled by prefrontal activation. A tendency for parahippocampal activation during reinstatement could indicate a reactivation of the old memory trace. Together, these findings contribute to our understanding of aversive visceral learning and memory processes relevant to the pathophysiology of chronic abdominal pain."

These recommendations are particularly relevant in Asians that have higher EGFR mutation prevalence. This study aims to explore current testing practices, logistics of testing, types of EGFR mutation, and prevalence of EGFR mutations in patients with advanced NSCLC in a large comprehensive cancer center in Korea.Our retrospective cohort included 1,503 NSCLC patients aged ≥18 years, with stage IIIB/IV disease, who attended the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, Korea, from January 2007 through July 2010. Trained oncology nurses reviewed and abstracted data from electronic medical records.This cohort had a mean age (SD) of 59.6 (11.1) years, 62.7% were males, and 52.9% never-smokers. The most common NSCLC histological types were adenocarcinoma (70.5%) and squamous cell carcinoma (18.0%). Overall, 39.5% of patients were tested for EGFR mutations. The proportion of patients undergoing EGFR testing during January 2007 through July 2008, August 2008 through September 2009, and October 2009 through July 2010 were 23.3%, 38.3%, and 63.5%, respectively (P<0.001). The median time elapsed between cancer diagnoses and receiving EGFR testing results was 21 days. EGFR testing was most frequently ordered by oncologists (57.7%), pulmonologists (31.9%), and thoracic surgeons (6.6%). EGFR testing was more commonly requested for women, younger patients, stage IV disease, non-smokers, and adenocarcinoma histology. Of 586 cases successfully tested for EGFR mutations, 209 (35.7%) were positive, including 118 cases with exon 19 deletions and 62 with L858R mutations. EGFR mutation positive patients were more likely to be female, never-smokers, never-drinkers and to have adenocarcinoma.In a large cancer center in Korea, the proportion of EGFR testing increased from 2007 through 2010. The high frequency of EGFR mutation positive cases warrants the need for generalized testing in Asian NSCLC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2159065057,"Dietary fat exerts a potent stimulatory effect on feeding. This effect is mediated, at least in part, by a cephalic mechanism that involves recruitment of the vagus nerve and subsequent activation of endocannabinoid signaling in the gut. Here, we used a sham-feeding protocol in rats to identify fatty-acid constituents of dietary fat that might be responsible for triggering small-intestinal endocannabinoid signaling. Sham feeding rats with a corn oil emulsion increased endocannabinoid levels in jejunum, relative to animals that received either mineral oil (which contains no fatty acids) or no oil. Sham-feeding emulsions containing oleic acid (18:1) or linoleic acid (18:2) caused, on average, a nearly 2-fold accumulation of jejunal endocannabinoids, whereas emulsions containing stearic acid (18:0) or linolenic acid (18:3) had no such effect. In a 2-bottle-choice sham-feeding test, rats displayed strong preference for emulsions containing 18:2, which was blocked by pretreatment with the peripherally restricted CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists, AM6546 and URB447.

Carbon monoxide (CO) has been shown in cross-sectional analyses to be a reliable surrogate for particles<2.5 µm in diameter (PM2.5) in kitchens where wood-burning cookfires are a dominant source, but it is unknown whether a similar PM2.5-CO relationship exists for personal exposures longitudinally. We repeatedly measured (216 measures, 116 women) 24-hour personal PM2.5 (median [IQR] = 0.11 [0.05, 0.21] mg/m3) and CO (median [IQR] = 1.18 [0.50, 2.37] mg/m3) among women cooking over open woodfires or chimney woodstoves in Guatemala. Pollution measures were natural-log transformed for analyses. In linear mixed effects models with random subject intercepts, we found that personal CO explained 78% of between-subject variance in personal PM2.5. We did not see a difference in slope by stove type. This work provides evidence that in settings where there is a dominant source of biomass combustion, repeated measures of personal CO can be used as a reliable surrogate for an individual's PM2.5 exposure. This finding has important implications for the feasibility of reliably estimating long-term (months to years) PM2.5 exposure in large-scale epidemiological and intervention studies of HAP."

In the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most small molecules are taken up by outer membrane carboxylate channel (Occ) proteins, which can be divided into two distinct subfamilies, OccD and OccK. Here we characterize substrate transport mediated by Occ proteins belonging to both subfamilies. Based on the determination of the OccK2-glucuronate co-crystal structure, we identify the channel residues that are essential for substrate transport. We further show that the pore regions of the channels are rigid in the OccK subfamily and highly dynamic in the OccD subfamily. We also demonstrate that the substrate carboxylate group interacts with central residues of the basic ladder, a row of arginine and lysine residues that leads to and away from the binding site at the channel constriction. Moreover, the importance of the basic ladder residues corresponds to their degree of conservation. Finally, we apply the generated insights by converting the archetype of the entire family, OccD1, from a basic amino acid-specific channel into a channel with a preference for negatively charged amino acids.

Herpes viruses are thought to play an etiological role in the development and/or progression of IPF. The influence of viruses on PH associated with IPF is unknown. We aimed to investigate the influence of viruses in IPF patients focusing on aspects related to PH. A laboratory mouse model of gamma-herpesvirus (MHV-68) induced pulmonary fibrosis was also assessed.Lung tissue samples from 55 IPF patients and 41 controls were studied by molecular analysis to detect various viral genomes. Viral molecular data obtained were correlated with mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and arterial remodelling. Different clinical and morphological variables were studied by univariate and multivariate analyses at time of transplant and in the early post-transplant period. The same lung tissue analyses were performed in MHV-68 infected mice.A higher frequency of virus positive cases was found in IPF patients than in controls (p = 0.0003) and only herpes virus genomes were detected. Viral cases showed higher mPAP (p = 0.01), poorer performance in the six minute walking test (6MWT; p = 0.002) and higher frequency of primary graft (PGD) dysfunction after lung transplant (p = 0.02). Increased arterial thickening, particularly of the intimal layer (p = 0.002 and p = 0.004) and higher TGF-β expression (p = 0.002) were demonstrated in viral cases. The remodelled vessels showed increased vessel cell proliferation (Ki-67 positive cells) in the proximity to metaplastic epithelial cells and macrophages. Viral infection was associated with higher mPAP (p = 0.03), poorer performance in the 6MWT (p = 0.008) and PGD (p = 0.02) after adjusting for other covariates/intermediate factors. In MHV-68 infected mice, morphological features were similar to those of patients.Herpesviral infections may contribute to the development of PH in IPF patients."
https://openalex.org/W2098047948,"To determine the effects of liposomal targeting of prednisolone phosphate (Lip-PLP) to synovial lining macrophages on M1 and M2 polarization in vitro and during experimental arthritis.Experimental arthritis (antigen and immune complex induced) was elicited in mice and prednisolone containing liposomes were given systemically. Synovium was investigated using microarray analysis, RT-PCR and histology. Bone-marrow macrophages were stimulated towards M1 using LPS and IFNγ before treatment by PLP-liposomes. M1 and M2 markers were determined using RT-PCR.Microarray analysis of biopsies of inflamed synovium during antigen induced arthritis (AIA) showed an increased M1 signature characterized by upregulation of IL-1β, IL-6 and FcγRI starting from day 1 and lasting up until day 7 after arthritis induction. The M2 signature remained low throughout the 7 day course of arthritis. Treatment of AIA with intravenously delivered Lip-PLP strongly suppressed joint swelling and synovial infiltration whereas colloidal gold containing liposomes exclusively targeted the macrophages within the inflamed synovial intima layer. In vitro studies showed that Lip-PLP phagocytosed by M1 macrophages resulted in a suppression of the M1 phenotype and induction of M2 markers (IL-10, TGF-β, IL-1RII, CD163, CD206 and Ym1). In vivo, Lip-PLP treatment strongly suppressed M1 markers (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p40, iNOS, FcγRI, Ciita and CD86) after local M1 activation of lining macrophages with LPS and IFN-γ and during experimental AIA and immune complex arthritis (ICA). In contrast, M2 markers were not significantly upregulated in antigen-induced arthritis and down regulated in immune complex arthritis.This study clearly shows that systemic treatment with PLP-liposomes selectively targets synovial lining macrophages and inhibits M1 activation. In contrast to in vitro findings, PLP-liposomes do not cause a shift of synovial lining macrophages towards M2."
https://openalex.org/W2011484328,"Trypsin-like proteases are synthesized as inactive zymogens and convert to the mature form upon activation by specific enzymes, often assisted by cofactors. Central to this paradigm is that the zymogen does not convert spontaneously to the mature enzyme, which in turn does not feed back to activate its zymogen form. In the blood, the zymogens prothrombin and prethrombin-2 require the prothrombinase complex to be converted to the mature protease thrombin, which is unable to activate prothrombin or prethrombin-2. Here, we show that replacement of key residues within the activation domain causes these zymogens to spontaneously convert to thrombin. The conversion is started by the zymogen itself, which is capable of binding ligands at the active site, and is abrogated by inactivation of the catalytic residue Ser-195. The product of autoactivation is functionally and structurally equivalent to wild-type thrombin. Zymogen autoactivation is explained by conformational selection, a basic property of the trypsin fold uncovered by structural and rapid kinetics studies. Both the zymogen and protease undergo a pre-existing equilibrium between active and inactive forms. The equilibrium regulates catalytic activity in the protease and has the potential to unleash activity in the zymogen to produce autoactivation. A new strategy emerges for the facile production of enzymes through zymogen autoactivation that is broadly applicable to trypsin-like proteases of biotechnological and clinical interest."

Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is thought to be an endogenous mechanism against ischemia-reperfusion injury possibly through detoxification of toxic aldehydes. We investigated whether cardioprotection by isoflurane depends on activation of ALDH2.Anesthetized rats underwent 40 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 120 min of reperfusion and were randomly assigned to the following groups: untreated controls, isoflurane preconditioning with and without an ALDH2 inhibitor, the direct activator of ALDH2 or a protein kinase C (PKCε) inhibitor. Pretreatment with isoflurane prior to ischemia reduced LDH and CK-MB levels and infarct size, while it increased phosphorylation of ALDH2, which could be blocked by the ALDH2 inhibitor, cyanamide. Isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes were treated with hypoxia followed by reoxygenation. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and injury which were attenuated by isoflurane and forced the activation of ALDH2. In contrast, the effect of isoflurane-induced protection was almost abolished by knockdown of ALDH2. Activation of ALDH2 and cardioprotection by isoflurane were substantially blocked by the PKCε inhibitor. Activation of ALDH2 by mitochondrial PKCε plays an important role in the cardioprotection of isoflurane in myocardium I/R injury."
https://openalex.org/W1982223048,"Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Bordetella pertussis are important modulators of the immune system. Interaction of the lipid A region of LPS with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complex causes dimerization of TLR4 and activation of downstream nuclear factor κB (NFκB), which can lead to inflammation. We have previously shown that two strains of B. pertussis, BP338 (a Tohama I-derivative) and 18-323, display two differences in lipid A structure. 1) BP338 can modify the 1- and 4'-phosphates by the addition of glucosamine (GlcN), whereas 18-323 cannot, and 2) the C3' acyl chain in BP338 is 14 carbons long, but only 10 or 12 carbons long in 18-323. In addition, BP338 lipid A can activate TLR4 to a greater extent than 18-323 lipid A. Here we set out to determine the genetic reasons for the differences in these lipid A structures and the contribution of each structural difference to the ability of lipid A to activate TLR4. We show that three genes of the lipid A GlcN modification (Lgm) locus, lgmA, lgmB, and lgmC (previously locus tags BP0399-BP0397), are required for GlcN modification and a single amino acid difference in LpxA is responsible for the difference in C3' acyl chain length. Furthermore, by introducing lipid A-modifying genes into 18-323 to generate isogenic strains with varying penta-acyl lipid A structures, we determined that both modifications increase TLR4 activation, although the GlcN modification plays a dominant role. These results shed light on how TLR4 may interact with penta-acyl lipid A species."

To understand the molecular mechanism of VP, we employed the site-directed mutagenesis, biochemical assays, structural biology, and molecular dynamics simulation studies to investigate VP-causing hPPO mutants. We report here the crystal structures of R59Q and R59G mutants in complex with acifluorfen at a resolution of 2.6 and 2.8 Å. The r.m.s.d. of the Cα atoms of the active site structure of R59G and R59Q with respect to the wild-type was 0.20 and 0.15 Å, respectively. However, these highly similar static crystal structures of mutants with the wild-type could not quantitatively explain the observed large differences in their enzymatic activity. To understand how the hPPO mutations affect their catalytic activities, we combined molecular dynamics simulation and statistical analysis to quantitatively understand the molecular mechanism of VP-causing mutants. We have found that the probability of the privileged conformations of hPPO can be correlated very well with the k(cat)/K(m) of PPO (correlation coefficient, R(2) > 0.9), and the catalytic activity of 44 clinically reported VP-causing mutants can be accurately predicted. These results indicated that the VP-causing mutation affect the catalytic activity of hPPO by affecting the ability of hPPO to sample the privileged conformations. The current work, together with our previous crystal structure study on the wild-type hPPO, provided the quantitative structural insight into human variegate porphyria disease."
https://openalex.org/W2123994850,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with persistent inflammation and oxidative stress in susceptible individuals. Using microarray analysis of bronchial biopsy samples from patients with COPD and controls, we identified Wnt4 as being up-regulated in COPD. Analysis of bronchial biopsy samples showed a very strong correlation between Wnt4 and IL8 gene expression, suggesting that Wnt4 plays a role in chronic lung inflammation. In vitro, Wnt4 induced proliferation and inflammation in human epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and normal primary human bronchial epithelial cells in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was enhanced in the presence of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) as a result of activation of the p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Hydrogen peroxide, but not proinflammatory stimuli, up-regulated Wnt4 expression in epithelial cells. In monocytic THP-1 and primary airway smooth muscle cells, Wnt4 induced inflammation and enhanced the inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide and IL-1β but did not induce proliferation. In addition, these other cell types did not have enhanced Wnt4 expression in response to hydrogen peroxide. Our results indicate that airway epithelial activation, due to oxidative stress, may lead to Wnt4 induction. Wnt4, in turn, acts through the noncanonical pathway to activate epithelial cell remodeling and IL8 gene expression, leading to neutrophil infiltration and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2060555529,"The pathogen and parasite community that inhabits every free-living organism can control host vital rates including lifespan and reproductive output. To date, however, there have been few experiments examining pathogen community assembly replicated at large-enough spatial scales to inform our understanding of pathogen dynamics in natural systems. Pathogen community assembly may be driven by neutral stochastic colonization and extinction events or by niche differentiation that constrains pathogen distributions to particular environmental conditions, hosts, or vectors. Here, we present results from a regionally-replicated experiment investigating the community of barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDV's) in over 5000 experimentally planted individuals of six grass species along a 700 km latitudinal gradient along the Pacific coast of North America (USA) in response to experimentally manipulated nitrogen and phosphorus supplies. The composition of the virus community varied predictably among hosts and across nutrient-addition treatments, indicating niche differentiation among virus species. There were some concordant responses among the viral species. For example, the prevalence of most viral species increased consistently with perennial grass cover, leading to a 60% increase in the richness of the viral community within individual hosts (i.e., coinfection) in perennial-dominated plots. Furthermore, infection rates of the six host species in the field were highly correlated with vector preferences assessed in laboratory trials. Our results reveal the importance of niche differentiation in structuring virus assemblages. Virus species distributions reflected a combination of local host community composition, host species-specific vector preferences, and virus responses to host nutrition. In addition, our results suggest that heterogeneity among host species in their capacity to attract vectors or support pathogens between growing seasons can lead to positive covariation among virus species."
https://openalex.org/W2033932554,"T cell trafficking between the blood and lymphoid organs is a complex, multistep process that requires several highly dynamic and coordinated changes in cyto-architecture. Members of the ezrin, radixin and moesin (ERM) family of actin-binding proteins have been implicated in several aspects of this process, but studies have yielded conflicting results. Using mice with a conditional deletion of ezrin in CD4+ cells and moesin-specific siRNA, we generated T cells lacking ERM proteins, and investigated the effect on specific events required for T cell trafficking. ERM-deficient T cells migrated normally in multiple in vitro and in vivo assays, and could undergo efficient diapedesis in vitro. However, these cells were impaired in their ability to adhere to the β1 integrin ligand fibronectin, and to polarize appropriately in response to fibronectin and VCAM-1 binding. This defect was specific for β1 integrins, as adhesion and polarization in response to ICAM-1 were normal. In vivo, ERM-deficient T cells showed defects in homing to lymphoid organs. Taken together, these results show that ERM proteins are largely dispensable for T cell chemotaxis, but are important for β1 integrin function and homing to lymphoid organs."

There is growing awareness that functionality of steroidogenic tissues may decline as a function of increasing oxidative stress associated with natural aging or vascular disorders such as atherogenesis (15Zirkin B.R.

A common feature of these conditions is the increasing level of lipid oxidation products in the circulation, reflecting greater free radical-mediated peroxidation of unsaturated phospholipids and Ch in cell membranes and lipoproteins (18Porter N.A. Caldwell S.E. Mills K.A. Mechanisms of free radical oxidation of unsaturated lipids.Lipids. 1995; 30: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Lipid hydroperoxides generated during this process are susceptible to reductive turnover, undergoing either iron/copper-catalyzed one-electron reduction to oxyl radicals or enzyme-catalyzed two-electron reduction to alcohols, the former intensifying peroxidative damage and the latter attenuating it (18Porter N.A.

Lipid hydroperoxide generation, turnover, and effector action in biological systems.J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1529-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to increased hydrophilicity, most lipid hydroperoxides, including Ch-derived species (ChOOHs), are capable of translocating between membranes or lipoproteins and membranes, and this can greatly expand their oxidative toxicity and signaling ranges (20Vila A.

Our previous studies revealed that intermembrane ChOOH transfer in cell-free and cellular systems could be accelerated by sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2), the first reported examples of enhanced lipid hydroperoxide translocation by a lipid transfer protein (23Vila A. Levchenko V.V. Korytowski W. Girotti A.W.

More recently, we showed that transfer of 7α-hydroperoxycholesterol (7α-OOH) from liposomes to isolated Mito was strongly enhanced by recombinant StarD4 and that this induced Mito peroxidative damage and loss of membrane potential (24Korytowski W. Rodriguez-Agudo D. Pilat A. Girotti A.W.

We now report that steroidogenic activation of mouse MA-10 Leydig cells, as evidenced by StAR protein expression and progesterone synthesis, makes these cells remarkably more sensitive to redox damage and dysfunction by Mito-targeted 7α-OOH.

[14C]7α-OOH was prepared similarly, using [14C]Ch that had been prepurified by HPLC. 7α-OH was generated by 7α-OOH reduction with triphenylphosphine followed by HPLC-UV isolation, as described previously (26Korytowski W.

Samples of MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells were kindly supplied by Dr. Mario Ascoli (University of Iowa) as a research gift. This cell line was initially described in 1981 (28Ascoli M. Characterization of several clonal lines of cultured Leydig tumor cells: gonadotropin receptors and steroidogenic responses.Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C, using gelatin-coated plasticware and DME/F12 medium supplemented with 15% horse serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). Prior to an experiment, cells at 60–70% confluency were washed twice with DME medium without F12 and serum and then incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C in DME that either contained 1.0 mm Bt2cAMP or lacked it (control). The effect of Bt2cAMP treatment on StAR protein expression in MA-10 cells was monitored by immunoblot analysis as described (29Wang X.J. Dyson M.T. Mondillo C. Patrignani Z. Pignataro O. Stocco D.M. Interaction between arachidonic acid and cAMP signaling pathways enhances steroidogenesis and StAR gene expression in MA-10 Leydig tumor cells.Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2002; 188: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with some minor modification. Cells were harvested by scraping and lysed by treating with lysing buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate at pH 7.4) for 30 min on ice; a mixture of protease inhibitors was also present. After centrifugation (16,000 × g, 2 min), samples were analyzed for protein content by bicinchoninic assay, using reagents from Pierce Chemical, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with primary and secondary antibodies diluted according to supplier recommendations. Visualization of resolved proteins, including β-actin as a loading standard, was accomplished using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence detection kit from Thermo Scientific. Quantitation of protein bands was carried out using LabWorks image acquisition and analysis software from UVP (Upland, CA). Silencer siRNAs for mouse StarD1 were purchased from Ambion. The following two pairs of small interfering oligonucleotide constructs were used: (i) 5′-GCUGUCCUACAUCCAGCAAtt-3′ (sense), 5′-UUGCUGGAUGUAGGACAGCtc-3′ (antisense); (ii) 5′-GGCCUUGGGCAUACUCAACtt-3′ (sense), 5′-GUUGAGUAUGCCCAAGGCCtt-3′ (antisense). Two scrambled oligonucleotide pairs (Ambion) were used as a control. Single transfections of duplex mixtures were carried out using X-tremeGENE (20 μl/ml) as a cell-permeabilizing reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Cells seeded 16 h before transfection and reaching 60% confluence were switched to Opti-MEM medium (Gibco/Life Technologies) and treated for 6–8 h with 100 nm siRNA (1:1 mixture of constructs i and ii) followed by a 32–48-h recovery period in full growth medium without siRNA or X-tremeGENE. The cells were then washed, overlaid with DME medium, and stimulated with 1 mm Bt2cAMP for 3 h, after which they were scraped into cold protease inhibitor-containing PBS (Chelex-treated phosphate-buffered saline (25 mm sodium phosphate, 125 mm NaCl, pH 7.4)) and analyzed for StarD1 expression by Western blotting. Small unilamellar liposomes (50-nm SUVs) consisting of POPC/Ch/7α-OOH (1.0:0.8:0.2 by mol), POPC/Ch/7α-OH (1.0:0.8:0.2 by mol), or POPC alone were prepared by an extrusion process (30Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Vesicles of variable sizes produced by a rapid extrusion procedure.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). A chloroform solution of chosen lipids was dried under argon and then held under a vacuum for several hours at room temperature. After hydration in Chelex-treated PBS followed by five cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing, the vesicle suspension was passed 10 times through two stacked 0.05-μm-pore polycarbonate filters in an Extruder apparatus (Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). The resulting SUVs (2.0 mm total lipid in bulk suspension in PBS) were stored under argon at 4 °C until used experimentally, typically within 3 days. For accomplishing this, Bt2cAMP-treated MA-10 cells, along with untreated controls, were exposed to liposomal [14C]7α-OOH (0.2 μCi/ml) at an initial concentration of 50 or 100 μm, using a stock suspension of POPC/Ch/[14C]7α-OOH (1.0:0.8:0.2 by mol) SUVs. After incubation at 37 °C for increasing periods up to 5 h, the cells were washed twice, detached, and collected by centrifugation. In some preparations, Mito were isolated by differential centrifugation (23Vila A. Levchenko V.V. Korytowski W. Girotti A.W. Sterol carrier protein-2-facilitated intermembrane transfer of cholesterol- and phospholipid-derived hydroperoxides.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12592-12605Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Total cell samples and Mito fractions were analyzed for incorporated radioactivity by scintillation counting. 7α-OOH uptake by isolated Mito from stimulated and nonstimulated cells was determined similarly, using 50 μm SUV [14C]7α-OOH in this case. The effect of StarD1 knockdown on 7α-OOH uptake by Mito in stimulated versus nonstimulated was also assessed, the general approach being similar to that described above for wild type cells. In initial experiments, control and Bt2cAMP-stimulated MA-10 cells were incubated with 50 μm SUV 7α-OOH for a single time (3 h) and then separated from the SUVs, washed, and treated with the ratiometric probe JC-1 (2.5 μg/ml) for 30 min. After washing, the cells were recovered into PBS (4 × 106 cells/ml), and fluorescence was recorded, using a PTI QM-7SE spectrofluorometer. Instrument settings were as follows: red fluorescence (λex 560 nm; λem 590 nm); green fluorescence (λex 488 nm; λex 525 nm). The ΔΨm strength is reflected by the magnitude of 590 nm (red) emission relative to 525 nm (green) emission, referred to as the fluorescence intensity ratio (RFI) (31Reers M. Smiley S.T.

Wild type and knockdown cells (after 36 h of recovery from transfection) were either not stimulated or stimulated with 0.15 mm Bt2cAMP in DME medium for 1.5 h, after which 100 μm liposomal 7α-OOH was introduced and incubation continued at 37 °C. At various time points up to 7 h, the cells were washed once, treated with JC-1 (see above), washed again, and analyzed immediately using a BioTek Synergy MX fluorescence plate reader (Winooski, VT) set as follows: red (λex 560 nm; λem 595 nm); green (λex 485 nm; λem 535 nm). Experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. At selected times after exposure to 7α-OOH, cells were recovered by scraping into ice-cold PBS, pelleted, and lysed as described previously (33Bhowmick R. Girotti A.W. Cytoprotective induction of nitric oxide synthase in a cellular model of 5-aminolevulinic acid-based photodynamic therapy.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 48: 1296-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). After protein determination, lysates for determining caspase-3/7 activity were incubated with 25 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC for 30 min in a 96-well plate at 25 °C. Fluorescence of liberated AMC was recorded with the Synergy MX plate reader, using 360 nm excitation and 460 nm emission. Lysates for determining caspase-9 activity were treated with Caspase-Glo 9 reagents in a 96-well plate according to supplier instructions, and chemiluminescence was measured with a Victor 3V Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The effect of 7α-OOH on the ability of stimulated MA-10 cells to synthesize progesterone from Ch was examined using an enzyme immunoassay approach. The assay is based on competition between progesterone and a progesterone-acetylcholinesterase conjugate for binding to an immobilized progesterone-specific antibody in a 96-well format. The signal derives from hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine to thiocholine, which reacts with Ellman's reagent to give 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), the absorbance of which at 412 nm is monitored (34Ellman G.L.

A progesterone-enzyme immunoassay kit for carrying out this assay was obtained from Cayman Chemicals. Detailed instructions supplied with the kit were followed throughout. Cells preincubated in the absence or presence of Bt2cAMP for 1.5 h were washed and either not treated (control) or treated with liposomal 7α-OOH or 7α-OH in increasing concentrations up to 100 μm for 16 h at 37 °C, after which viability was assessed by MTT (thiazolyl blue) assay (32Kriska T.

https://openalex.org/W1996061983,"Laying hens often experience unbalanced calcium utilization which can cause deficiencies in bone and egg mineralization. Because melatonin has been shown to affect bone mineralization in other animals, we examined whether treating hens with melatonin would affect eggshell thickness and improve skeletal performance, thereby reducing skeletal and egg shell defects. Birds were given a diet containing either low (30 µg/kg), medium (300 µg/kg), or high (3 mg/kg) concentrations of melatonin, or control feed through approximately one laying cycle. We examined the weight, length, and strength of egg, femur, tibia, and keel. Hens treated with a high concentration of melatonin showed significant strengthening in their femur and tibia, as measured by maximum force sustained and breaking force, compared to controls. Egg weights from hens treated with melatonin were significantly greater than those from hens that were not treated with melatonin. Conversely, egg shell mass of hens treated with melatonin was significantly lower than those of hens not treated with melatonin. Our data suggest that melatonin may affect the allocation of calcium to bone at the expense of egg shell mineralization."
https://openalex.org/W2051073702,"Backgroud RNA interference (RNAi) has recently emerged as a potential treatment modality for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy, but the lack of cellular targets and sustained efficacy limits its application. The purpose of this study is to develop an HCC tissue-specific RNAi system and investigate its possibility for HCC treatment. Methods Two different HCC-specific RNAi systems in which therapeutic miRNA or shRNA against target gene (Beclin 1) was directly or indirectly driven by alpha-fetoprotein promoter (AFP-miRNA and AFP-Cre/LoxP-shRNA) were constructed. Human HCC cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B and HCCLM3) and non-HCC cell lines (L-02, Hela and SW1116) were infected with the systems. The effectiveness and tissue-specificity of the systems were examined by Q-PCR and western blot analysis. The efficacy of the systems was further tested in mouse model of HCC by intravenous or intratumoral administration. The feasibility of the system for HCC treatment was evaluated by applying the system as adjuvant therapy to enhance sorafenib treatment. An AFP-Cre/LoxP-shRNA system targeting Atg5 gene (AFP-Cre/LoxP-shRNA-Atg5) was constructed and its efficacy in sensitizing HCC cells (MHCC97L/PLC) to sorafenib treatment was examined by apoptosis assay in vitro and tumorigenesis assay in vivo. Results The AFP-miRNA system could silence target gene (Beclin 1) but required a high titer which was lethal to target cells. The AFP-Cre/LoxP-shRNA system could efficiently knockdown target gene while maintain high HCC specificity. Intratumoral injection of the AFP-Cre/LoxP-shRNA system could efficiently silence target gene (Beclin 1) in vivo while intravenous administration could not. The AFP-Cre/LoxP-shRNA system target Atg5 gene could significantly sensitize MHCC97L/PLC cells to sorafenib-induced apoptosis in vitro and tumor growth suppression in vivo. Conclusions An efficient HCC tissue-specific RNAi system (AFP-Cre/LoxP-shRNA) was successfully established. The system provides a usable tool for HCC-specific RNAi therapy, which may serve as a new treatment modality for HCC."
https://openalex.org/W1977796095,"The development of mature, antigen-inexperienced (naive) T cells begins in the thymus and continues after export into the periphery. Post-thymic maturation of naive T cells, in humans, coincides with the progressive loss of markers such as protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31). As a consequence, subpopulations of naive T cells can be recognised raising questions about the processes that give rise to the loss of these markers and their exact relationship to recent thymic emigrants (RTE). Here, we combine a mathematical survival analysis approach and data from healthy and thymectomised humans to understand the apparent persistence of populations of ‘veteran’ PTK7+T cells in thymectomised individuals. We show that a model of heterogeneity in rates of maturation, possibly linked to natural variation in TCR signalling thresholds or affinity for self-antigens, can explain the data. This model of maturation predicts that the average post-thymic age of PTK7+T cells will increase linearly with the age of the host suggesting that, despite the immature phenotype, PTK7+cells do not necessarily represent a population of RTE. Further, the model predicts an accelerated increase in the average post-thymic age of residual PTK7+T cells following thymectomy and may also explain in part the prematurely aged phenotype of the naive T cell pool in individuals thymectomised early in life."
https://openalex.org/W2051583716,"Prediction of secondary site mutations that reinstate mutated p53 to normalcy has been the focus of intense research in the recent past owing to the fact that p53 mutants have been implicated in more than half of all human cancers and restoration of p53 causes tumor regression. However laboratory investigations are more often laborious and resource intensive but computational techniques could well surmount these drawbacks. In view of this, we formulated a novel approach utilizing computational techniques to predict the transcriptional activity of multiple site (one-site to five-site) p53 mutants. The optimal MCC obtained by the proposed approach on prediction of one-site, two-site, three-site, four-site and five-site mutants were 0.775,0.341,0.784,0.916 and 0.655 respectively, the highest reported thus far in literature. We have also demonstrated that 2D and 3D features generate higher prediction accuracy of p53 activity and our findings revealed the optimal results for prediction of p53 status, reported till date. We believe detection of the secondary site mutations that suppress tumor growth may facilitate better understanding of the relationship between p53 structure and function and further knowledge on the molecular mechanisms and biological activity of p53, a targeted source for cancer therapy. We expect that our prediction methods and reported results may provide useful insights on p53 functional mechanisms and generate more avenues for utilizing computational techniques in biological data analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2025235514,"Optic nerve atrophy caused by abnormal intraocular pressure (IOP) remains the most common cause of irreversible loss of vision worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine whether topically applied IOP-lowering eye drugs affect retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and retinal metabolism in a rat model of optic neuropathy. IOP was elevated through cauterization of episcleral veins, and then lowered either by the daily topical application of timolol, timolol/travoprost, timolol/dorzolamide, or timolol/brimonidine, or surgically with sectorial iridectomy. RGCs were retrogradely labeled 4 days prior to enucleation, and counted. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry allowed the identification of IOP-dependent proteomic changes. Genomic changes were scrutinized using microarrays and qRT-PCR. The significant increase in IOP induced by episcleral vein cauterization that persisted until 8 weeks of follow-up in control animals (p<0.05) was effectively lowered by the eye drops (p<0.05). As anticipated, the number of RGCs decreased significantly following 8 weeks of elevated IOP (p<0.05), while treatment with combination compounds markedly improved RGC survival (p<0.05). 2D-PAGE and Western blot analyses revealed an IOP-dependent expression of crystallin cry-βb2. Microarray and qRT-PCR analyses verified the results at the mRNA level. IHC demonstrated that crystallins were expressed mainly in the ganglion cell layer. The data suggest that IOP and either topically applied antiglaucomatous drugs influence crystallin expression within the retina. Neuronal crystallins are thus suitable biomarkers for monitoring the progression of neuropathy and evaluating any neuroprotective effects."
https://openalex.org/W2041474508,"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is increasingly being demonstrated to be involved in calcium signaling in many cell types and species. Although it has been shown to play a role in smooth muscle cell contraction in several tissues, nothing is known about its possible role in tracheal smooth muscle, a muscle type that is clinically relevant to asthma. To determine whether NAADP functions as a second messenger in tracheal smooth muscle contraction, we used the criteria set out by Sutherland for a molecule to be designated a second messenger. We report that NAADP satisfies all five criteria as follows. First, the NAADP antagonist Ned-19 inhibited contractions in tracheal rings and calcium increases in isolated smooth muscle cells induced by the muscarinic agonist carbachol. Second, NAADP increased cytosolic calcium in isolated cells when microinjected and was blocked by Ned-19. Third, tracheal homogenates could synthesize NAADP by base exchange from exogenous NADP and nicotinic acid and metabolize exogenous NAADP to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide by a 2'-phosphatase. Fourth, carbachol induced a rapid and transient increase in endogenous NAADP levels. Fifth, tracheal homogenates contained NAADP-binding sites of high affinity. Taken together, these data demonstrate that NAADP functions as a second messenger in tracheal smooth muscle, and therefore, steps in the NAADP signaling pathway might provide possible new drug targets."
https://openalex.org/W2024825690,"In a complex behavioral system, such as an animal society, the dynamics of the system as a whole represent the synergistic interaction among multiple aspects of the society. We constructed multiple single-behavior social networks for the purpose of approximating from multiple aspects a single complex behavioral system of interest: rhesus macaque society. Instead of analyzing these networks individually, we describe a new method for jointly analyzing them in order to gain comprehensive understanding about the system dynamics as a whole. This method of jointly modeling multiple networks becomes valuable analytical tool for studying the complex nature of the interaction among multiple aspects of any system. Here we develop a bottom-up, iterative modeling approach based upon the maximum entropy principle. This principle is applied to a multi-dimensional link-based distributional framework, which is derived by jointly transforming the multiple directed behavioral social network data, for extracting patterns of synergistic inter-behavioral relationships. Using a rhesus macaque group as a model system, we jointly modeled and analyzed four different social behavioral networks at two different time points (one stable and one unstable) from a rhesus macaque group housed at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC). We report and discuss the inter-behavioral dynamics uncovered by our joint modeling approach with respect to social stability."
https://openalex.org/W2130963910,"Class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) proteins compose a signaling module that orchestrates lineage specification during embryogenesis. We show here that this module also regulates the generation of mouse induced pluripotent stem cells by defined transcription factors. Class IIa HDACs and MEF2 proteins rise steadily during fibroblast reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells. MEF2 proteins tend to block the process by inducing the expression of Tgfβ cytokines, which impairs the necessary phase of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Conversely, class IIa HDACs endeavor to suppress the activity of MEF2 proteins, thus enhancing the MET and colony formation efficiency. Our work highlights an unexpected role for a developmental axis in somatic cell reprogramming and provides new insight into how the MET is regulated in this context."
https://openalex.org/W1991772842,"The immunopathogenic mechanisms leading to psoriasis remain unresolved. CD57 is a marker of replicative inability and immunosenescence on CD8+ T cells and the proportion of CD57 expressing CD8+ T cells is increased in a number of inflammatory conditions.We examined the expression of CD57 on T cells in the skin of patients affected with psoriasis, comparing lesional and unaffected skin. We also assessed functionality of the T cells by evaluating the secretion of several inflammatory cytokines (IL-17A, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-33, TNF-alpha, IL-21, IL-22, and IL-27), from cell-sorted purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from lesional and unaffected skin biopsies of psoriasis patients.We observed that the frequency of CD57+CD4+ and CD57+CD8+ T cells was significantly higher in unaffected skin of psoriasis patients compared to lesional skin. Sorted CD4+ T cells from psoriatic lesional skin produced higher levels of IL-17A, IL-22, and IFN-gamma compared to unaffected skin, while sorted CD8+ T cells from lesional skin produced higher levels of IL-17, IL-22, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2 compared to unaffected skin.These findings suggest that T cells in unaffected skin from psoriasis patients exhibit a phenotype compatible with replicative inability. As they have a lower replicative capacity, CD57+ T cells are less frequent in lesional tissue due to the high cellular turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2114457115,"Bcl-XL is a member of Bcl-2 family of proteins involved in the regulation of intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Its overexpression in many human cancers makes it an important target for anti-cancer drugs. Bcl-XL interacts with the BH3 domain of several pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 partners. This helical bundle protein has a pronounced hydrophobic groove which acts as a binding region for the BH3 domains. Eight independent molecular dynamics simulations of the apo/holo forms of Bcl-XL were carried out to investigate the behavior of solvent-exposed hydrophobic groove. The simulations used either a twin-range cut-off or particle mesh Ewald (PME) scheme to treat long-range interactions. Destabilization of the BH3 domain-containing helix H2 was observed in all four twin-range cut-off simulations. Most of the other major helices remained stable. The unwinding of H2 can be related to the ability of Bcl-XL to bind diverse BH3 ligands. The loss of helical character can also be linked to the formation of homo- or hetero-dimers in Bcl-2 proteins. Several experimental studies have suggested that exposure of BH3 domain is a crucial event before they form dimers. Thus unwinding of H2 seems to be functionally very important. The four PME simulations, however, revealed a stable helix H2. It is possible that the H2 unfolding might occur in PME simulations at longer time scales. Hydrophobic residues in the hydrophobic groove are involved in stable interactions among themselves. The solvent accessible surface areas of bulky hydrophobic residues in the groove are significantly buried by the loop LB connecting the helix H2 and subsequent helix. These observations help to understand how the hydrophobic patch in Bcl-XL remains stable in the solvent-exposed state. We suggest that both the destabilization of helix H2 and the conformational heterogeneity of loop LB are important factors for binding of diverse ligands in the hydrophobic groove of Bcl-XL."

https://openalex.org/W2036680378,"The fitness of any organisms includes the survival and reproductive rate of adults and the survival of their offspring. Environmental selection pressures might not affect these two aspects of an organism equally. Assuming that an organism first allocates its limited resources to maintain its survival under environmental selection pressure, our model, based on the evolutionarily stable strategy theory, surprisingly shows that the sex ratio is greatly affected by the environmental pressure intensity and by the reproductive resource elasticity of offspring survival. Moreover, the concept of the resource elasticity of offspring survival intrinsically integrates the ecological concepts of K selection and r selection. The model shows that in a species with reproductive strategy K, increased environmental selection pressure will reduce resource allocation to the male function. By contrast, in a species with reproductive strategy r, harsher environmental selection pressure will increase allocation to the male function. The elasticity of offspring survival might vary not only across species, but also across many other factors affecting the same species (e.g., age structure, spatial heterogeneity), which explains sex ratio differences across species or age structures and spatial heterogeneity in the same species."
