https://openalex.org/W1967354499,"In this study, the joining sequences between chromosomes 14 and 18 on the 14q+ chromosomes of a patient with pre-B-cell leukemia and four patients with follicular lymphoma carrying a t(14;18) chromosome translocation were analyzed. In each case, the involved segment of chromosome 18 has recombined with the immunoglobulin heavy-chain joining segment (JH) on chromosome 14. The sites of the recombination on chromosome 14 are located close to the 5' end of the involved JH segment, where the diversity (D) regions are rearranged with the JH segments in the production of active heavy-chain genes. As extraneous nucleotides (N regions) were observed at joining sites and specific signal-like sequences were detected on chromosome 18 in close proximity to the breakpoints, it is concluded that the t(14;18) chromosome translocation is the result of a mistake during the process of VDJ joining at the pre-B-cell stage of differentiation. The putative recombinase joins separated DNA segments on two different chromosomes instead of joining separated segments on the same chromosome, causing a t(14;18) chromosome translocation in the involved B cells."
https://openalex.org/W1571398079,"Conditioned medium from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells contains an inactive plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI). This latent PAI can be activated with denaturants. For example, less than 0.01 units/microliter of PAI activity was detected in untreated conditioned medium, but medium treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate (1.7 mM), guanidine HCl (4 M), urea (12 M) or KSCN (6 M) contained 0.9, 1.9, 0.8, and 0.5 units/microliter, respectively. This effect was dose-dependent with respect to the particular reagent used, and the same concentration of reagent which induced PAI activity also stimulated the ability of a component in conditioned medium to form sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable complexes with exogenously added plasminogen activators. Neither activity was stimulated by extensive dialysis or by treatment with NaCl (5 M), Na2SO4 (2.8 M), or dicetyl phosphate (0.1%). Analysis of treated and untreated conditioned medium by gel filtration revealed that the latent and active PAIs migrated with apparent Mr values of 30,000 and 50,000, respectively. Thus, is associated with an increase in the apparent Mr of the molecule. These observations suggest that activation does not result from the removal of either a small dialyzable component from the medium, or of a large Mr component that is bound to the latent PAI. Other possible mechanisms of activation are discussed. We recently isolated an active PAI from bovine endothelial cells (van Mourik, J.A., Lawrence, D.A., and Loskutoff, D.J. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14914-14921). Monospecific antiserum to this active PAI selectivity immunoprecipitated the latent PAI from conditioned medium. These results indicate that the two PAIs are immunologically related and suggest that the latent form is converted into the active form by the sodium dodecyl sulfate present during the purification."
https://openalex.org/W1554005852,"Prostaglandin D synthetase was purified 2,600-fold from rat brain to apparent homogeneity, as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. The purified enzyme was a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of 27,000 +/- 1,000. The pI value, sedimentation coefficient, and partial specific volume were 4.6, 4.1 s, and 0.73 ml/g, respectively. The enzyme was stable between pH 4 and 11 at the temperature lower than 25 degrees C and resistant to a heat treatment under alkaline conditions (pH 8-11). About 50% of the activity was detected after a heat treatment at 100 degrees C for 5 min at pH 10. However, the enzyme was readily inactivated by the isomerase reaction of prostaglandin H2 to prostaglandin D2. The enzyme required sulfhydryl compounds such as dithiothreitol, glutathione, beta-mercaptoethanol, cysteine, and cysteamine for the reaction, but stoichiometric oxidation of these sulfhydryl compounds was not observed. The optimum pH, Km value for prostaglandin H2, and the turnover number were 9.5, 14 microM, and 170 min-1, respectively. The antibody was raised against the purified enzyme in a rabbit, which showed only one positive band in immunoblotting after gel electrophoresis of crude extracts of the brain at the same position as that of the purified enzyme. More than 90% of the prostaglandin D synthetase activity in the brain was absorbed by an excess amount of the antibody, indicating that our preparation is a major component of the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of prostaglandin D2 in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W1554275806,"ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin has been used to identify the alpha subunit of Ni, the guanine nucleotide-binding protein which mediates hormone and GTP inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Two proteins have been purified from bovine cerebral cortex which are substrates for ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin, a 41-kDa protein (alpha 41) and a 39-kDa protein (alpha 39). The 41-kDa protein is very similar to the subunit of Ni purified from other tissues while the function of the 39-kDa protein is unknown (Neer, E. J., Lok, J. M., and Wolf, L. G. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14222-14229; Sternweis, P. C., and Robishaw, J. D. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13806-13813). We now show that the purified alpha 39 protein from bovine brain is a relatively hydrophilic protein which associates with a hydrophobic beta gamma component. The complex can be dissociated by guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate. The alpha 39 component binds guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate with a KD of 27 nM. We have developed polyclonal antibodies to alpha 39 and beta. The antibodies to alpha 39 cross-react weakly with alpha 41 in an immunoblot assay indicating some homology between the two proteins but making it unlikely that alpha 39 is derived from alpha 41. Using the antibodies for quantitation we found that alpha 39 is 0.5% and beta is 0.7% of membrane proteins. While the antibodies cross-react with alpha 39 and beta proteins in many different species, central nervous system tissues always have more immunoreactivity than membranes from peripheral organs. Anti-beta antibody recognizes the beta subunit when it is associated with alpha 39 or alpha 41 and can immunoprecipitate both alpha . beta gamma trimers. The guanine nucleotide-dependent dissociation of the alpha 39 . beta gamma trimer suggests that the complex could inhibit adenylate cyclase by liberating free beta gamma units. The function of alpha 39 may not, however, be exclusively to regulate adenylate cyclase but may include coupling hormone receptors to other effectors. Antibodies specific for alpha 39 and beta will be useful tools in determining the functions of alpha 39 and beta in hormone-responsive cells."

https://openalex.org/W1554256515,"Mouse blastocysts which had been activated from diapause in utero appeared to take up amino acids via a Na+-dependent transport system with novel characteristics. In contrast to other cell types, uptake of 3-aminoendobicyclo [3,2,1]octane-3-carboxylic acid (BCO) by blastocysts was largely Na+ dependent. Moreover, L-alanine and BCO met standard criteria for mutual competitive inhibition of the Na+-dependent transport of each other. The Ki for each of these amino acids as an inhibitor of transport of the other had a value similar to the value of its Km for transport. In addition, both 2-aminoendobicyclo [2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (Ki approximately 1.0 mM) and L-valine (Ki approximately 0.10 mM) appeared to inhibit Na+-dependent transport of alanine and BCO competitively. Finally, alanine and L-lysine appeared to compete for the same Na+-dependent transport sites in blastocysts. For these reasons, we conclude that lysine, alanine, and BCO are transported by a common Na+-dependent system in blastocysts. In addition, the apparent interaction of the system with other basic amino acids, such as 1-dimethylpiperidine-4-amino-4-carboxylic acid, which has a nondissociable positive charge on its side chain, and L-arginine and L-homoarginine, whose cationic forms are highly predominant at neutral pH, suggests that the cationic forms of basic amino acids are transported by the wide-scope system."
https://openalex.org/W1502032494,"Washed human platelets prelabeled with [14C]arachidonic acid and then exposed to the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 mobilized [14C]arachidonic acid from phospholipids and formed 14C-labeled thromboxane B2, 12-hydroxy-5-8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid, and 12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid. Addition of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) by itself at concentrations from 10 to 1000 ng/ml did not release arachidonic acid or cause the formation of any of its metabolites, nor did it affect the metabolism of exogenously added arachidonic acid. When 1 microM A23187 was added to platelets pretreated with 100 ng of PMA/ml for 10 min, the release of arachidonic acid, and the amount of all arachidonic acid metabolites formed, were greatly increased (average 4.1 +/- 0.5-fold in eight experiments). This effect of PMA was mimicked by other stimulators of protein kinase C, such as phorbol dibutyrate and oleoyl acetoyl glycerol, but not by 4-alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, which does not stimulate protein kinase C. However, phosphorylation of the cytosolic 47-kDa protein, the major substrate for protein kinase C in platelets, was produced at lower concentrations of PMA and at a much higher rate than enhancement of arachidonic acid release by PMA, suggesting that 47-kDa protein phosphorylation is not directly involved in mobilization of the fatty acid. PMA also potentiated arachidonic acid release when stimulation of phospholipase C by the ionophore (which is due to thromboxane A2 and/or secreted ADP) was blocked by aspirin plus ADP scavengers, i.e. apyrase or creatine phosphate/creatine phosphokinase. Increased release of arachidonic acid was attributable to loss of [14C]arachidonic acid primarily from phosphatidylcholine (79%) with lesser amounts derived from phosphatidylinositol (12%) and phosphatidylethanolamine (8%). Phosphatidic acid, whose production is a sensitive indicator of phospholipase C activation, was not formed. Thus, the potentiation of arachidonic acid release by PMA appeared to be due to phospholipase A2 activity. These results suggest that diacylglycerol formed in response to stimulation of platelet receptors by agonists may cooperatively promote release of arachidonic acid via a Ca2+/phospholipase A2-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2104688697,"We have previously described the construction and expression of a hybrid gene encoding a membrane-anchored form of rat growth hormone. This protein is anchored in cellular membranes by a carboxy-terminal extension composed of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein. The protein is transported efficiently to the Golgi apparatus but not to the cell surface. To examine the possibility that N-linked glycosylation might be required for protein transport to the cell surface, we created two mutant proteins (using in vitro mutagenesis) in which single amino acids at two random sites in anchored growth hormone were changed to generate consensus sequences required for addition of N-linked carbohydrate. These mutant proteins, and a protein with both glycosylation sites, were glycosylated and were transported to the cell surface. These results suggest that N-linked glycosylation can serve as a signal for protein transport to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1604192266,"Tissue factor (factor III) is a lipoprotein cofactor which markedly enhances the catalytic effect of coagulation factor VIIa upon factors IX and X. Human tissue factor apoprotein was purified 53,000-fold to homogeneity from brain using acetone delipidation, Triton X-100 extraction, and affinity chromatography upon factor VII-agarose. The purified apoprotein has an apparent molecular weight of 44,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, an amino acid composition similar to bovine brain tissue factor, and an NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of Ser-X-Asn-Thr-Val-Ala-Val-Tyr-X-Tyr-X-Leu-Lys-(Ser)-Lys-Asn-Phe. Optimal relipidation of the tissue factor apoprotein was associated with a 5000-fold enhancement of clotting activity and occurred at a phospholipid/apoprotein (w/w) ratio of greater than 600."
https://openalex.org/W1597299868,"A plasminogen activator secreted from human kidney cells was highly purified by affinity chromatography on an anti-urokinase IgG-Sepharose column. The purified plasminogen activator was inactive and had a single-chain structure and a Mr of 50,000. It not only did not incorporate diisopropyl fluorophosphate, which reacts with active site serine residue in urokinase, but also did not bind to p-aminobenzamidine-immobilized CH-Sepharose, to which urokinase bind via its side-chain binding pocket present in active center. The plasminogen activator was converted to the active two-chain form with the same Mr by catalytic amounts of plasmin. Its potential enzymatic activity was quenched completely by anti-urokinase IgG, but not by anti-tissue plasminogen activator Ig. These results indicate that the plasminogen activator is an inactive proenzyme form of human urokinase. Therefore, the plasminogen activator was termed single-chain pro-urokinase. The cleavage of single-chain pro-urokinase by plasmin induced conformational change which followed the generation of reactive serine residue at active site, the increase enzyme activity and the reduction of its high affinity for fibrin. These findings suggest that conformational change occurs in both regions responsible for enzyme activity and affinity for fibrin upon activation of single-chain pro-urokinase."
https://openalex.org/W1969268760,"A psbA gene encoding the target of photosystem II herbicide inhibition, the 32,000-dalton thylakoid membrane protein, has been cloned from a mutant of Anacystis nidulans R2, which is resistant to 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea-(diuron). A cloned DNA fragment from within the coding region of this gene transforms wild-type cells to herbicide resistance, proving that mutation within psbA is responsible for that phenotype. The mutation consists of a single nucleotide change that replaces serine at position 264 of the wild-type protein with alanine in that of the diuron-resistant mutant."

https://openalex.org/W1527372023,"The effect of anoxia and substrate removal on cytosolic free calcium (Ca2+i), cell calcium, ATP content, and calcium efflux was determined in cultured monkey kidney cells (LLC-MK2) exposed to 95% N2, 5% CO2 for 60 min. In the control period, the basal Ca2+i level was 70.8 +/- 9.4 nM. During 1 h of anoxia without substrate, ATP content decreased 70%, Ca2+i and calcium efflux increased 2.5-fold, while the total cell calcium did not change. When the cells were perfused again with O2 and 5 mM glucose, the ATP concentration, Ca2+i, and calcium efflux returned to control levels within 15-20 min. In the presence of 20 mM glucose, anoxia did not produce any change in ATP, in Ca2+i or in calcium efflux. An important source of calcium contributing to the rise in Ca2+i induced by anoxia appears to be extracellular because the rate of rise in Ca2+i is proportional to the extracellular calcium concentration, and because La3+ which blocks calcium influx greatly reduces the rise in Ca2+i. Mitochondria appear to control Ca2+i as well since the early rise in Ca2+i cannot be blocked by La3+ during the initial phase of anoxia, and since the mitochondrial inhibitor carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone increases Ca2+i further during reoxygenation and slows the return of Ca2+i to control levels."
https://openalex.org/W1994283751,"During their complex life cycle, myxobacteria manifest a number of cell interactions. These include contact-mediated interactions as well as those mediated by soluble extracellular signals.

https://openalex.org/W1515964439,"Human platelet thrombospondin (TSP) was purified to homogeneity by chromatography on fibrinogen coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose. The yield of TSP was 1.3 mg or approximately 22% of that present in platelet-rich plasma as determined by radioimmunoassay. It analyzed on discontinuous sodium dodecyl sulfate gels as a single band having apparent molecular weights of 180,000 and greater than 400,000 under reducing and nonreducing conditions, respectively. Amino acid analysis gave results similar to previously published values. Antibodies raised in rabbits were monospecific as evaluated by radioimmunoassay. In double immunodiffusion tests, these antibodies gave one line of identity against TSP purified by this procedure and TSP purified by published procedures, confirming the identity of the material isolated. The protein possesses no lectin-like activity. The specificity of the TSP-fibrinogen interaction was investigated. TSP binding to fibrinogen-Sepharose occurred in the presence of EDTA, indicating that calcium and magnesium ions are not required for interaction of TSP with fibrinogen. The binding of TSP to fibrinogen-Sepharose was quantitatively blocked by pretreatment with an antibody to the cyanogen bromide cleavage fragment composed of residues 241-476 of the carboxyl-terminal end of the alpha chain of fibrinogen. Antibodies against the D and E domains of fibrinogen had no effect on the binding. Excess fibrinogen (30 mg/ml) added to platelet extract quantitatively inhibited binding of TSP to fibrinogen-Sepharose. TSP preferentially bound to uncross-linked fibrin, suggesting that the TSP-fibrinogen binding site is unavailable in cross-linked fibrin. These results indicate that TSP binds specifically to immobilized fibrinogen or uncross-linked fibrin through determinants present in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the alpha chain and that these interactions do not require calcium or magnesium ions."
https://openalex.org/W1661830960,"The polypeptide thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulate, within seconds to minutes, the transcription of the prolactin gene in a rat pituitary cell line (GH4). Because a series of agents that act to stimulate prolactin secretion fail to alter prolactin gene transcription, it is suggested that secretory events are neither obligatory for nor causal of hormone-induced transcriptional stimulation. Elevation of cytosolic-free calcium does not stimulate prolactin gene transcription; however, several agents that act to antagonize calcium-dependent processes inhibit or abolish both TRH and EGF stimulation of prolactin gene transcription and a specific hormone-dependent nuclear phosphorylation. In contrast, inhibitors of the slow calcium channel exert minimal effects on TRH-stimulated prolactin gene expression, suggesting that calcium influx through membrane channels is not crucial for the observed nuclear actions of TRH. Activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters mimics the nuclear actions of TRH. In the presence of increased intracellular calcium levels, the effects of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate on prolactin gene transcription are quantitatively identical to those observed in response to TRH or EGF."
https://openalex.org/W1992034175,"A rabbit antiserum to a peptide sequence present in the precursor for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (proTRH), deduced from cloned amphibian-skin complementary DNA, was raised by immunization with the synthetic decapeptide Cys-Lys-Arg-Gln-His-Pro-Gly-Lys-Arg-Cys (proTRH-SH). Immunohistochemical studies on rat brain tissue showed staining of neuronal perikarya in the parvicellular division of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the raphe complex of the medulla, identical to that already described for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Immunostaining was abolished by preincubation with proTRH-SH (10(-6)M) but not TRH (10(-5)M). Both TRH precursor and TRH were located in neurons of the paraventricular nucleus. However, in contrast to the findings for TRH, no staining was observed in axon terminals of the median eminence. These results suggest that a TRH precursor analogous to that reported in frog skin is present in the rat brain and that TRH in the mammalian central nervous system is a product of ribosomal biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1580947142,"Morphological and biochemical evidence have suggested that the components of the neuronal cytoskeleton, microtubules and neurofilaments (NF), interact with each other. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are plausible candidates for mediating some of these interactions and have been shown to bind to neurofilaments, as well as induce the formation of a viscous complex between neurofilaments and microtubules. By binding 32P-labeled MAPs to neurofilament proteins, which were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose, we determined that, of the three neurofilament subunits, only the core NF70 subunit bound MAPs. The binding to electrophoretically transferred NF70 was specific, saturable, and reversible. Binding parameters were estimated by binding 32P-labeled MAPs to purified NF70 immobilized on nitrocellulose. Approximately 1 mol of MAPs bound per 45 +/- 15 mol of NF70 with an approximate Kd approximately 2.0 +/- 0.9 X 10(-7) M (n = 8). Reassembled filaments in suspension were used to confirm the specific binding. Tubulin and NF70 apparently bind to different sites on MAPs."
https://openalex.org/W2128481036,"Clarification of the information processing system in bacterial sensing has been obtained by studying mutants that lack the capacity to modify receptors covalently. The remaining part of the system is able to receive signals from the receptor, to respond with partial adaptation, and to exhibit a chemotactic response. A cycle of chemical reactions analogous to the rhodopsin-transducin cycle in the visual system is shown to provide the proper characteristics to serve as the bridge between receptor and chemotactic output, which allows adaptation in the absence of covalent protein modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2102578206,"The structural characteristics of proteoglycans produced by seminiferous peritubular cells and by Sertoli cells are defined. Peritubular cells secrete two proteoglycans designated PC I and PC II. PC I is a high molecular mass protein containing chondroitin glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains (maximum 70 kDa). PC II has a protein core of 45 kDa and also contains chondroitin GAG chains (maximum 70 kDa). Preliminary results imply that PC II may be a degraded or processed form of PC I. A cellular proteoglycan associated with the peritubular cells is described which has properties similar to those of PC I. Sertoli cells secrete two different proteoglycans, designated SC I and SC II. SC I is a large protein containing both chondroitin (maximum 62 kDa) and heparin (maximum 15 kDa) GAG chains. Results obtained suggest that this novel proteoglycan contains both chondroitin and heparin GAG chains bound to the same core protein. SC II has a 50-kDa protein core and contains chondroitin (maximum 25 kDa) GAG chains. A proteoglycan obtained from extracts of Sertoli cells is described which contains heparin (maximum 48 kDa) GAG chains. In addition, Sertoli cells secrete a sulfoprotein, SC III, which is not a proteoglycan. SC III has properties similar to those of a major Sertoli cell-secreted protein previously defined as a dimeric acidic glycoprotein. The stimulation by follicle-stimulating hormone of the incorporation of [35S]SO2(-4) into moieties secreted by Sertoli cells is shown to represent an increased production or sulfation of SC III (i.e. dimeric acidic glycoprotein), and not an increased production or sulfation of proteoglycans. Results are discussed in relation to the possible functions of proteoglycans in the seminiferous tubule."
https://openalex.org/W1502744283,"A murine monoclonal antibody (IgG1k, Kd approximately 10(-8) M) specific for an epitope located on the heavy chain of human factor IXa was used to study structure-function relationships of factor IX. The antibody inhibited factor IX clotting activity but did not impair activation of factor IX either by factor XIa/calcium or by factor VIIa/tissue factor/calcium. The antibody also did not impair the binding of factor IXa to antithrombin III. Moreover, the antibody did not prevent calcium and phospholipid (PL) from inhibiting the binding of factor IXa to antithrombin III. The antibody also failed to impair activation of factor VII by factor IXa/calcium/PL. Furthermore, the antibody did not interfere with the very slow activation of factor X by factor IXa/calcium/PL. In contrast, the antibody did interfere with factor X activation when reaction mixtures also contained factor VIII:Ca/von Willebrand factor. The marked acceleration of factor X activation observed in control mixtures was not observed in mixtures containing the antibody. Similar results were obtained in reaction mixtures containing the Fab portion of the antibody and factor VIII:Ca free of von Willebrand factor. In additional experiments, factor VIII:Ca/von Willebrand factor was found to inhibit the binding of the antibody to 125I-factor IXa as determined using an immunosorbent assay. Moreover, the antibody displaced factor VIII:Ca from the factor X activator complex (IXa/calcium/PL/VIII:Ca) as evidenced by an altered elution pattern on gel filtration chromatography. From these observations, we conclude that the antibody impairs the clotting activity of factor IXa through interference with its binding of factor VIII:Ca. This suggests a significant role for the heavy chain (residues of 181-415) of factor IXa in binding factor VIII:Ca."
https://openalex.org/W1575163018,"The effect of Ca2+ on the ouabain- and bumetanide-resistant Na+ fluxes in intact red cells was studied at relatively constant internal Ca2+, membrane potential, and cell volume. The red cell calcium concentration was modified using the ionophore A23187. In fresh red cells, the Na+ influx and efflux (1.2 +/- 0.13 and 0.26 +/- 0.07 mmol/liter cells x h, respectively) were not affected by amiloride (1 mM). When external Ca2+ was raised from 0 to 150 microM, in the presence of A23187, both the Na+ influx and efflux were stimulated (about 3.5-fold). The Ca2+-activated Na+ efflux and influx had an apparent Km for activation by Ca2+o of about 25 microM. The Ca2+-dependent Na+ transport was inhibited 30-60% by amiloride (ID50 = 17.3 +/- 8 microM). Amiloride, however, had no effect on the Ca2+-dependent K+ influx. The amiloride-sensitive (AS) transport pathway was a linear function of the Na+o concentration in the range from 0 to 75 mM. The Ca2+i activation seems to depend on the metabolic integrity of red cells. 1) It does not take place in ATP-depleted red cells; 2) ATP-repletion of ATP-depleted red cells fully restored AS Na influx; and 3) ATP-enrichment (ATP-red cells) enhanced the AS Na influx by about 100%. The Ca2+-activated AS Na+ influx was not affected by either DIDS or trifluoperazine. The present results indicate that in human erythrocytes an increase in internal Ca2+ activates on otherwise silent AS Na+-transport system, which is dependent on the metabolic integrity of the red cells."

https://openalex.org/W1997698961,"Alterations in NMRI mouse skin induced by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in ""stage I of tumor promotion"" are slowly reversible, and this reversibility has a half-time of 10 to 12 weeks. The tumor response observed in the course of an initiation-promotion experiment in vivo is independent of whether stage I of promotion occurs before or after initiation. Since the time interval between treatment with the promoter, and subsequent initiation can be extended up to at least 6 weeks, an enhancement of initiation because of promoter-induced cellular DNA synthesis seems to be unlikely. This result may be inconsistent with the two-stage model of tumor promotion because it indicates that in skin the existence of initiated cells is not required for the induction of cellular alterations that are essential for the stage of skin tumorigenesis called stage I of promotion."
https://openalex.org/W1608647920,"A DNA polymerase with properties similar to mammalian polymerase beta has been isolated to near homogeneity from embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. A combination of exclusion chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis indicates that this enzyme is composed of a single polypeptide of molecular weight-110,000. Optimum activity on a nicked template occurs at pH 8.4 in the presence of 15 mM MgCl2 and 250 mM NaCl. Enzyme activity is strongly inhibited by dideoxythymidine triphosphate but is relatively insensitive to aphidicolin and N-ethylmalemide. These properties clearly distinguish this enzyme from polymerase alpha, which has previously been characterized from this tissue. This report represents the first extensive purification of a beta-like polymerase from the Protostomic branch of the animal phylogenetic tree. It furthermore generates the potential for a genetic analysis of the function of polymerase beta in DNA recombination, repair, and synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1515767910,"Murine mastocytoma cells were incubated in vitro with inorganic [35S]sulfate, in the absence or presence of 2.5 mM n-butyrate, and labeled heparin was isolated. The polysaccharide produced in the presence of butyrate showed a lower charge density on anion exchange chromatography than did the control material and a 3-fold increased proportion (54 versus 17% for the control) of components with high affinity for antithrombin. Structural analysis of heparin labeled with [3H] glucosamine in the presence of butyrate showed that approximately 35% of the glucosamine units were N-acetylated, as compared to approximately 10% in the control material; the nonacetylated glucosamine residues were N-sulfated. The presence of butyrate thus leads to an inhibition of the N-deacetylation/N-sulfation process in heparin biosynthesis, along with an augmented formation of molecules with high affinity for antithrombin. Preincubation of the mastocytoma cells with butyrate was required for manifestation of either effect; when the preincubation period was reduced from 24 to 10 h the effects of butyrate were no longer observed. Assays for microsomal N-acetylheparosan deacetylase activity failed to show any significant inhibition of the enzyme at butyrate concentrations well above those found to affect heparin biosynthesis in intact mastocytoma cells. Moreover, a polysaccharide formed on incubating mastocytoma microsomal fraction with UDP-[3H]glucuronic acid, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, and 3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate in the presence of 5 mM butyrate showed the same N-acetyl/N-sulfate ratio as did the corresponding control polysaccharide, produced in the absence of butyrate. These findings suggest that the effect of butyrate on heparin biosynthesis depends on the integrity of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1986070775,"The immune response antigens (la antigens) are heterodimeric cell-surface glycoproteins that regulate lymphocyte and macrophage interactions leading to the production of antibody against foreign antigens. The class II genes in the I region of the murine major histocompatibility complex encode the alpha and beta chains of the two known la antigens, I-A and I-E. Molecular cloning of the I region led to the discovery of three DNA regions, A beta 2, psi A beta 3, and E beta 2, which share some nucleotide homology with the classical class II beta genes. In this report we present evidence that A beta 2 is transcribed in spleen and in a cultured B cell hybridoma. A beta 2 mRNA is also found on membrane-bound polysomes, suggesting that it is translated. In contrast to the classical I region genes, A beta 2 transcripts are not induced in macrophage cells by gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN). This difference in sensitivity to gamma-IFN suggests that B cells and macrophages regulate the expression of the class II genes by distinct mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1483799990,"We have investigated the pH-dependent interaction between large unilamellar phospholipid vesicles (liposomes) and membrane vesicles derived from Bacillus subtilis, utilizing a fluorescent assay based on resonance energy transfer (RET) (Struck, D. K., Hoekstra, D., and Pagano, R. E. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 4093-4099). Efficient interaction occurs only with negatively charged liposomes, containing cardiolipin or phosphatidylserine, as revealed by the dilution of the RET probes from the liposomal bilayer into the bacterial membrane. The initial rate of fluorophore dilution increases steeply with decreasing pH. The interaction involves a process of membrane fusion, as indicated by the proportional transfer of cholesteryl-[1-14C]oleate, 14C-labeled egg PC, and the RET probes from the liposomes to the bacterial vesicles, the formation of interaction products with an intermediate buoyant density, and the appearance of colloidal gold, initially encapsulated in the liposomes, in the internal volume of fused structures as revealed by thin-section electron microscopy. Treatment of B. subtilis vesicles with trypsin strongly inhibits the fusion reaction, indicating the protein dependence of the process. Vesicles derived from Streptococcus cremoris or from the inner membrane of Escherichia coli also show low pH-dependent fusion with liposomes. The fusion process described in this paper may well be of considerable importance to studies on the mechanisms of membrane fusion and to studies on the structure and function of bacterial membranes. In addition, the fusion reaction could be utilized to deliver foreign substances into bacterial protoplasts."
https://openalex.org/W1554104048,"Abstract Bovine heart mitochondrial NADH----ubiquinone reductase (complex I), contains two disulfide-linked subunits of 75 and 33 kDa as revealed by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with beta-mercaptoethanol omitted from preparation of the sample for the first dimension. Two unidentified polypeptides (110-115 and 69 kDa) are also found in disulfide linkage with the two complex I subunits. The 110-115-kDa polypeptide appears to be pyridine dinucleotide transhydrogenase by several criteria including selective precipitation with an antibody raised to the purified transhydrogenase. The two disulfide-linked subunits were also found in a product cross-linked for 2 min with dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) along with five other complex I subunits of 53-57, 42, 24-27, 17-18, and 12.5-15.5 kDa (Gondal, J.A., and Anderson, W.M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 5931-5935) indicating that these seven subunits lie within 11-12 A of each other at one or more points in space in the enzyme's interior. Cross-linking of complex I with DSP for 2 min in the presence of 1 microM rotenone yielded a cross-linked product consisting of the two natural disulfide-linked subunits and the 110-115- and 69-kDa polypeptides. This suggests that rotenone induces a conformational change in the enzyme that moves the seven DSP cross-linked subunits away from each other and outside the 11-12 A bridging distance of DSP. This alteration in conformation may be communicated to iron-sulfur center N-2 within the hydrophobic outer shell of the enzyme to prevent electron transfer to its natural electron acceptor, ubiquinone. A model of rotenone action based upon these observations is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1556665604,"Euglena gracilis chloroplasts contain a 145,000-base pair chromosome that encodes genes for ribosomal, transfer, and messenger RNAs. These genes are transcribed within the organelle by chloroplast RNA polymerase activities that are specific for different classes of RNA. Two transcriptional activities have been isolated from Euglena chloroplasts. (Greenberg, B. M., Narita, J. O., DeLuca-Flaherty, C., Gruissem, W., Rushlow, K. A., and Hallick, R. B. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14880-14887). One, the soluble extract, contains enzymes active in tRNA transcription and processing. The other activity, the transcriptionally active chromosome, consisting of a chloroplast DNA-dependent RNA polymerase tightly bound to chloroplast DNA, only transcribes rRNA genes even though the entire chloroplast genome is present. We have extensively purified the transcriptionally active chromosome using high salt concentrations to dissociate loosely bound proteins. The result is a highly enriched extract containing three major polypeptides of Mr 116,000-118,000, 83,000-88,000, and 24,000-26,000 that retains complete selectivity for rDNA transcription. It is probable that one, or both, of the high molecular weight proteins are functional components of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The identification and characterization of the transcriptionally active chromosome is a first step towards understanding how chloroplast rRNA synthesis is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1530783825,"A tyrosinase has been purified from the skin of the frog Xenopus laevis. Dihydroxyphenylalanine oxidase and tyrosine hydroxylase activities co-purify throughout the procedure. The enzyme is isolated in an inactive form, but both enzymatic activities are activated by a variety of anionic detergents. Of these, sodium dodecyl sulfate (NaDodSO4) is the most effective. The enzyme activation occurs at NaDodSO4 concentrations well below the critical micelle concentration and it remains active at concentrations as high as 30 mM (1%). Neither activity is stimulated by cationic or nonionic detergents, or a variety of other agents, including trypsin. The purified tyrosinase is a glycoprotein having a polypeptide Mr = 175,000 by NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This monomeric species is enzymatically active in the presence of NaDodSO4. Detergent-activated tyrosinase has a KM for dihydroxyphenylalanine of 6 X 10(-4) M and a KM for tyrosine of 4 X 10(-4) M. Both activities are inhibited by copper chelators but not by an iron chelator. Further characterization of the detergent activation of this enzyme is presented in a companion paper (Wittenberg, C., and Triplett, E. L. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12542-12546)."
https://openalex.org/W1506442914,"As a primary step in leukotriene biosynthesis, arachidonic acid is converted into 5-hydroperoxy-6-trans-8,11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid by 5-lipoxygenase. This enzyme is studied in the supernatant fraction from sonified RBL-1 cells, a preparation that converts [1-14C]arachidonic acid to 5-hydroxy-6-trans-8,11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid and several 5,12-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids including LTB4. In order to examine the reversibility of inhibitors, the supernatant fraction can be depleted of low molecular weight constituents by vacuum filtration. The 5-lipoxygenase is irreversibly inhibited by 500 microM N-ethyl-maleimide or 300 microM methyl methanethiolsulfonate, reagents that react covalently with protein sulfhydryl groups. In contrast, diphenyl disulfide reversibly inhibits this enzyme at 1-5 microM, irrespective of the GSH concentration in the supernatant. KCN also inhibits 5-lipoxygenase at 4 mM, suggesting the presence of a metal-containing prosthetic group. These observations imply that diphenyl disulfide and similar molecules with electron-releasing substituents on the aromatic rings could inhibit by binding to an electrophilic metallic center, the binding being stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the enzyme and the aromatic groups on the flexible disulfide. Even though diphenyl disulfide does not inhibit soybean 15-lipoxygenase or endoperoxide synthase in cell-free systems, this compound does suppress prostaglandin as well as leukotriene synthesis in intact murine peritoneal macrophages and CXBG cells. Since lipoxygenases are susceptible to peroxide activation and peroxidase deactivation, changes in the redox state of the cell may alter arachidonic acid metabolism as effectively as actual enzyme inhibition."

An additional 1 to 2 percent of the population has normal pigmentation but is heterozygous and carries a recessive allele for albinism. The retinogeniculocortical pathways were studied in normally pigmented cats that carry a recessive allele for albinism. The cats exhibited abnormalities in their visual pathways similar to those present in homozygous albinos. These results imply that visual anomalies like those found in albinos may be present in 1 to 2 percent of the human population."
https://openalex.org/W1484942335,"A multifunctional protein kinase, purified from rat liver as ATP-citrate lyase kinase, has been identified as a glycogen synthase kinase. This kinase catalyzed incorporation of up to 1.5 mol of 32PO4/mol of synthase subunit associated with a decrease in the glycogen synthase activity ratio from 0.85 to a value of 0.15. Approximately 65-70% of the 32PO4 was incorporated into site 3 and 30-35% into site 2 as determined by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Release of 32PO4 from the phosphopeptides during automated Edman degradation confirmed the site 3 and 2 assignment. Thermal stability studies established that the phosphorylations of sites 3 and 2 were catalyzed by the same kinase. This multifunctional kinase was distinguished from glycogen synthase kinase-3 on the basis of nucleotide (ATP versus GTP) and protein substrate (glycogen synthase, ATP-citrate lyase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase) specificities. Since the phosphate contents in glycogen synthase of sites 3 and 2 are altered in diabetes and by insulin administration, the possible involvement of the multifunctional kinase was explored. Glycogen synthase purified from diabetic rabbits was phosphorylated in vitro by this multifunctional kinase at only 10% of the rate compared to synthase purified from control rabbits. Treatment of the diabetics with insulin restored the synthase to a form that was readily phosphorylated in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1574495206,"HbA1c is the most prevalent of the minor human hemoglobins. It is formed by the nonenzymatic addition of glucose to the alpha-amino group of the beta chain by an initial condensation reaction and a subsequent intermolecular Amadori rearrangement. We have developed a method of analysis which utilizes high performance liquid chromatography to follow the formation of HbA1c and greatly simplifies the determination of the kinetic parameters associated with this reaction. This has allowed us to study the effects of several Hb ligands, including the hydrogen ion, on the kinetics of this glycosylation reaction. Both the initial condensation reaction and the subsequent rearrangement are shown to exhibit acid catalysis, but the rate of the condensation step is limited by the extent of protonation of the alpha-amino group. The variation in kinetic parameters as a function of hydrogen ion concentration has allowed us to determine the probable reaction mechanism of HbA1c formation by comparison to previously reported model systems of Schiff base formation and Amadori rearrangement. The formation of pre-HbA1c from deoxy-Hb shows an increased forward rate when compared to oxy-Hb. The presence of physiologic concentrations of CO2 causes a proportional decrease in both k1 and k-1. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate causes a significant increase in the keq of the formation reaction. The effects of CO and the substitution of L-glucose for D-glucose are not significant."
https://openalex.org/W146078149,"A 42-kDa gelatin binding fragment of human plasma fibronectin was labeled with fluorescein and its fluid-phase interaction with gelatin was investigated. At 25 degrees C in 0.1 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.3, a dissociation constant, Kd = 0.6 microM, was obtained from the dependence of fluorescence polarization on gelatin concentration. An identical value was obtained for the unlabeled fragment by competition. Binding was unaffected by higher concentrations of NaCl up to 1.0 M, but increased as much as 20-fold at low ionic strength. The dependence of Kd on temperature revealed that dissociation of the complex is accompanied by an increase in entropy. Thus, the interaction is not dominated by either hydrophobic or electrostatic forces; an important role for hydrogen binding is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1587974702,"The occurrence of phosphate-containing sialyl oligosaccharides in bovine colostrum was investigated. Two major sialyl oligosaccharide phosphates were identified, one of which was structurally similar to the previously characterized sialyl oligosaccharide 1-phosphates of human urine. The second sialyl oligosaccharide phosphate of bovine colostrum was found to be of a novel type. Structural studies including monosaccharide and phosphate analysis, glycosidase and phosphatase treatments, methylation analysis, and periodate treatment indicated the structure of this compound to be NeuAc alpha 2-6Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc-6-P. This provides the first evidence for the occurrence of N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate as an integral component in complex carbohydrates."
https://openalex.org/W1519781020,"Tyrosinase purified from Xenopus is enzymatically inactive in aqueous buffers but is activated for both of its substrates by exposure to a variety of anionic detergents. Cationic and nonionic detergents, as well as a variety of other agents are ineffective. This stimulation by detergents is observed at all stages of the purification (Wittenberg, C., and Triplett, E. L. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12535-12541). Sodium dodecyl sulfate (NaDodSO4) is the most effective activator, and it was chosen for further characterization. Activation of both activities by NaDodSO4 is rapid and concentration dependent, resulting in maximal activity after 4 min at 1 mM NaDodSO4. NaDodSO4 treatment also results in both long and short term stabilization of the enzyme. The activation and stabilization are separable but stoichiometrically related. Both effects occur well below the critical micelle concentration suggesting that the interaction of NaDodSO4 monomers with the enzyme is involved in these processes. In support of this suggestion, the enzyme is shown to bind NaDodSO4 with high affinity, as determined by equilibrium dialysis. The isotherm for this binding correlates well with the requirement of NaDodSO4 for both activation and stabilization. All three effects are observable at 3 X 10(-5) M NaDodSO4 in the presence of 0.1 M sodium chloride. Activation and stabilization are maximal at 6 X 10(-4) M NaDodSO4, the critical micelle concentration of NaDodSO4 under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1604496518,"Partially reassembled high density lipoproteins (R-HDL) composed of apolipoprotein A-I and nonhydrolyzable analogues of phosphatidylcholine have been prepared, and their physical properties and reactivities as substrates for lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase and three phospholipases were tested. The stereo-chemical pairs L-DMPC-ether (1,2-O-ditetradecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine) and D-DMPC-ether (2,3-O-ditetradecyl-sn-glycero-1-phosphoryline) or L-DMPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl-choline) and D-DMPC (2,3-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-1-phosphorylcholine) have similar thermal properties. R-HDL composed of these four lipids also have similar thermal properties as well as lipid/protein ratios, molecular weights, and protein conformations. Vmax and apparent Km values for lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase on R-HDL consisting of linear combinations of L-DMPC and D-DMPC, L-DMPC-ether, or D-DMPC-ether plus 6 mol % cholesterol were measured. For the ether lecithins, there was a linear increase in Vmax with percentage of the acyl donor, L-DMPC, in R-HDL; over the same range, there was no change in Km. A comparison with bee venom and Naja melanoleuca phospholipase A2 demonstrated that the venom enzymes have turnover numbers almost 3 orders of magnitude greater than has lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase; the activity of the phospholipases was profoundly affected by the physical state of the lipid, whereas lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase activity was not. The differences between these two types of enzymes, which cleave the same bonds of a phosphatidylcholine, are assigned to different catalytic mechanisms. These studies show that R-HDL containing sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholines and sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine ethers have similar structure, properties, and affinities for phospholipolytic enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1640202933,"Nucleosomes have been fractionated on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, and nucleosome subtypes containing the Drosophila melanogaster specific protein D1 and ubiquitinated core histone H2A were identified by solubility in 0.1 M NaCl before nucleoprotein gel electrophoresis. Nucleosomes which contain DNA complementary to the 1.672 density simple satellite (sequence-AATAT-) bind protein D1, as demonstrated by two-dimensional hybridization mapping. This hybridization pattern allows the identification of D1 dinucleosomes, which, like D1 mononucleosomes, are reduced in mobility on the first dimension (nucleoprotein) gel by the addition of D1, an AT sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. The 1.705 density simple satellite (sequence-AAGAG-) is also found in nucleosomes, in a radically different subset from those of the -AATAT- DNA sequence. -AAGAG- nucleosomes do not contain D1 protein, but appear to be enriched in ubiquitinated core histone H2A. One-dimensional hybridization patterns suggest that -AAGAG- nucleosomal DNA is rapidly trimmed to a shorter DNA length than either bulk or -AATAT- nucleosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1480676510,"Two fractions of glycogen synthase were isolated from rat cardiac muscle on the basis of a different affinity for DEAE-cellulose and omega-aminobutyl-agarose. One of these fractions was able to transfer glucosyl residues from UDP-glucose not only to glycogen (GS-1 activity) but also to an endogenous acceptor. The latter reaction (GS-2 activity) occurred in the absence of added glycogen, and its reaction product was insoluble in trichloroacetic acid. This compound was degraded by amylolytic enzymes, thus showing that the product synthesized on the endogenous acceptor was an alpha 1,4-glucan. After incubation with alpha-amylase-free proteolytic enzyme, the compound was rendered trichloroacetic acid-soluble. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, under both native and denaturing conditions, showed that GS-2 reaction products moved electrophoretically associated to protein. Our results give further evidence for the association between an alpha 1,4-glucan and protein, which we postulate is related to the initiation of glycogen biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1563463473,"Pyruvate oxidase is a flavoprotein dehydrogenase isolated from Escherichia coli which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetate plus CO2. The maximal turnover of the enzyme, measured using a ferricyanide reductase assay, is increased 20-to 30-fold by either of two methods. Proteolysis in the presence of the substrate (pyruvate) and cofactor (Mg2+-thiamin pyrophosphate) results in cleavage at a single locus near the carboxyl terminus and concomitant activation. Phospholipids and detergents can bind to the enzyme and result in a similar activation, which is presumed to be physiologically relevant, since the enzyme functions as a peripheral membrane enzyme. Previous studies showed that proteolytic activation of pyruvate oxidase results in substantial changes in the absorption spectrum of the oxidized form of the bound flavin. Up to this time, similar studies of the lipid-activated form of the enzyme have not been feasible, since it is necessary to reduce the flavoprotein in order to induce binding to the lipids. In this paper, glutaraldehyde cross-linking of the lipid-activated enzyme is used to trap the enzyme in this form. Spectroscopic studies show alterations of the flavin spectrum similar to those observed upon proteolytic activation. This alteration in the flavin binding site is consistent with kinetic studies which suggest that activation results from an acceleration in the rates of electron transfer both into and out of the bound flavin, which appears to be more accessible in the activated forms of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W65954728,"The threonine analog beta-hydroxynorvaline (Hnv) is an inhibitor of asparagine-linked glycosylation. In the presence of the analog hepatocytes synthesized immunoreactive alpha 1-acid glycoprotein with 0-6 oligosaccharide chains. Pulse-chase experiments were conducted to compare the rates of secretion of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein from untreated, tunicamycin-treated, and Hnv-treated cells. Partially glycosylated (1-5 oligosaccharide chains) and unglycosylated (tunicamycin-inhibited) molecules exited the cells more slowly than native alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. In addition, secretion of fully glycosylated (6 oligosaccharide chains) alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was retarded in Hnv-treated cells when compared to controls. The slowest rate of secretion was exhibited by the unglycosylated form from Hnv-treated cells. These results suggest that Hnv-induced changes either in the extent of glycosylation or in the peptide sequence of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein can interfere with its transport through the cell. The major intracellular forms of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein from control and Hnv-treated cells were endoglycosidase H-sensitive and contained Man9-8 GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide structures. The oligosaccharide chains on the secreted molecules from control and Hnv-treated cells were entirely of the endoglycosidase H-resistant, complex type."
https://openalex.org/W1488725313,"In the ternary complex of thymidylate synthetase, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate (FdUMP), and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2H4folate), the 5-fluorouracil moiety is covalently bound to the enzyme by a sulfide linkage from C-6 and to either N-5 or N-10 of H4folate by a methylene bridge from C-5. In an effort to establish the site by which H4folate is attached to FdUMP, the ternary complex was subjected to reagents that cleave the C-9, N-10 bond of folate derivatives. The complex was stable to zinc dust in hydrochloric acid, a reagent that cleaves N-10-substituted but not N-5-substituted folates. The conditions of the Bratton-Marshall reaction, which involve the use of nitrous acid, were found to cleave N-5-substituted folates in yields ranging from 5 to 50%. Exposure of the double-labeled thymidylate synthetase-FdUMP-[2-14C,7,9,3',5'-3H]5,10-CH2H4folate complex to the Bratton-Marshall reaction resulted in 16% cleavage of the C-9, N-10 bond with release solely of p-aminobenzoylglutamate, whereas all of the carbon-14-labeled pterin residue remained covalently bound to the protein. These results demonstrate that in the ternary complex, the 5-fluorouracil residue is connected by a covalent bond to N-5 of H4folate."
https://openalex.org/W1565557462,"Magnesium transport across sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles was investigated in reaction mixtures of various composition using antipyrylazo III or arsenazo I to monitor extravesicular free Mg2+. The half-time of passive Mg2+ efflux from Mg2+-loaded SR was 100 s in 100 mM KCl, 150 S in 100 mM K gluconate, and 370 S in either 100 mM Tris methanesulfonate or 200 mM sucrose solutions. The concentration and time course of Mg2+ released into the medium was also measured during ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by SR. In reaction mixtures containing up to 3 mM Mg2+, small changes in free magnesium of 10 microM or less were accurately detected without interference from changes in free Ca2+ of up to 100 microM. Three experimental protocols were used to determine whether the increase of free [Mg2+] in the medium after an addition of ATP was due to Mg2+ dissociated from ATP following ATP hydrolysis or to Mg2+ translocation from inside to outside of the vesicles. 1) In the presence of ATP-regenerating systems which maintained constant ATP to ADP ratios and normal rates of active Ca2+ uptake, the increase of Mg2+ in the medium was negligible. 2) Mg2+ released during ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by SR was similar to that observed during ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by apyrase, in the absence of SR. 3) In SR lysed with Triton X-100 such that Ca2+ transport was uncoupled from ATPase activity, the rate and amount of Mg2+ release was greater than that observed during ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by intact vesicles. Taken together, the results indicate that passive fluxes of Mg2+ across SR membranes are 10 times faster than those of Ca2+ and that Mg2+ is not counter-transported during active Ca2+ accumulation by SR even in reaction mixtures containing minimal concentrations of membrane permeable ions that could be rapidly exchanged or cotransported with Ca2+ (e.g. K+ or Cl-)."

Two of these three major NADPH-NTB reductases possessed NADH-NTB reductase activity; the third was specific for NADPH and was isolated in this laboratory (Tryon, E., Cress, M. C., Hamada, M., and Kuby, S. A. (1979) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 197, 104-118) vis. NADPH-cytochrome c reductase (FAD-containing). A description of the isolation procedure is provided for one of these two NADH(NADPH)-NTB reductases, viz. NADH(NADPH)-cytochrome c reductase (FMN-containing), which accounts for about one-half of the total cyanide-insensitive menadione-activated respiration of this yeast. This NADH(NADPH)-cytochrome c reductase has been isolated from an extract of an acetone powder of the top-fermenting ale yeast, with an apparent purification of more than 67-fold and a final specific activity of 0.41 and 0.31 mumol/min/mg for NADH- and NADPH-dependent reduction, respectively. The isolated enzyme proved to be homogeneous by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate and on polyacrylamide gels. It had a pI of 5.25 (at gamma/2 = 0.05) and a molecular size under nondenaturing conditions (as determined by chromatography on Sephadex G-100 and Sephacryl S-200) of 70,000 daltons. On denaturation, the enzyme dissociated into two similar, if not identical, subunits which possessed a molecular weight of 34,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate/urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a weight average molecular weight of 35,000 by sedimentation equilibrium in the presence of 4.0 M guanidinium chloride. The absorbance spectrum of NADH(NADPH)-cytochrome c reductase (FMN-containing) showed three maxima at 464, 383, and 278 nm, with extinction coefficients of 9.88, 9.98, and 64.6 mM-1 cm-1, respectively. The reductase, as isolated, contained 0.63 mol of FMN/34,000-dalton subunit, with no metals and one sulfhydryl group/subunit. Its amino acid composition is reported herein.

Due to this structural similarity, we have studied the in vitro synthesis of GgOse3Cer-II3-sulfate using the system for GM2. Our results showed that GgOse3Cer-II3-sulfate could be synthesized from lactosylceramide 3'-sulfate and UDP-GalNAc catalyzed by N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase prepared from rat brain (Dicesare, J. L., and Dain, J. A. (1971) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 231, 385-393). As in the case of GM2, the GgOse3Cer-II3-sulfate biosynthesized in vitro or isolated from rat kidney could also be cleaved by human beta-hexosaminidase A in the presence of GM2-activator (Li, S.-C., Hirabayashi, Y., and Li, Y.-T. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 6234-6240). The fact that the GM2-activator could stimulate beta-hexosaminidase A to hydrolyze both GM2 and Gg-Ose3Cer-II3-sulfate indicates that these two glycolipids may be catabolyzed by the same mechanism."
