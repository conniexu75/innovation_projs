https://openalex.org/W4293298428,"Many organisms have evolved specialized immune pattern-recognition receptors, including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain–like receptors (NLRs) of the STAND superfamily that are ubiquitous in plants, animals, and fungi. Although the roles of NLRs in eukaryotic immunity are well established, it is unknown whether prokaryotes use similar defense mechanisms. Here, we show that antiviral STAND (Avs) homologs in bacteria and archaea detect hallmark viral proteins, triggering Avs tetramerization and the activation of diverse N-terminal effector domains, including DNA endonucleases, to abrogate infection. Cryo–electron microscopy reveals that Avs sensor domains recognize conserved folds, active-site residues, and enzyme ligands, allowing a single Avs receptor to detect a wide variety of viruses. These findings extend the paradigm of pattern recognition of pathogen-specific proteins across all three domains of life."
https://openalex.org/W4291016578,"Accurate and timely detection of recombinant lineages is crucial for interpreting genetic variation, reconstructing epidemic spread, identifying selection and variants of interest, and accurately performing phylogenetic analyses1-4. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, genomic data generation has exceeded the capacities of existing analysis platforms, thereby crippling real-time analysis of viral evolution5. Here, we use a new phylogenomic method to search a nearly comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny for recombinant lineages. In a 1.6 million sample tree from May 2021, we identify 589 recombination events, which indicate that around 2.7% of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes have detectable recombinant ancestry. Recombination breakpoints are inferred to occur disproportionately in the 3' portion of the genome that contains the spike protein. Our results highlight the need for timely analyses of recombination for pinpointing the emergence of recombinant lineages with the potential to increase transmissibility or virulence of the virus. We anticipate that this approach will empower comprehensive real-time tracking of viral recombination during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W4292229868,"Abstract Microglia are emerging as key drivers of neurological diseases. However, we lack a systematic understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here, we present a screening platform to systematically elucidate functional consequences of genetic perturbations in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia. We developed an efficient 8-day protocol for the generation of microglia-like cells based on the inducible expression of six transcription factors. We established inducible CRISPR interference and activation in this system and conducted three screens targeting the ‘druggable genome’. These screens uncovered genes controlling microglia survival, activation and phagocytosis, including neurodegeneration-associated genes. A screen with single-cell RNA sequencing as the readout revealed that these microglia adopt a spectrum of states mirroring those observed in human brains and identified regulators of these states. A disease-associated state characterized by osteopontin (SPP1) expression was selectively depleted by colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF1R) inhibition. Thus, our platform can systematically uncover regulators of microglial states, enabling their functional characterization and therapeutic targeting."
https://openalex.org/W4292865371,"Abstract Blood biomarkers indicating elevated amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease are needed to facilitate the initial screening process of participants in disease-modifying trials. Previous biofluid data suggest that phosphorylated tau231 (p-tau231) could indicate incipient Aβ pathology, but a comprehensive comparison with other putative blood biomarkers is lacking. In the ALFA+ cohort, all tested plasma biomarkers (p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231, GFAP, NfL and Aβ42/40) were significantly changed in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. However, plasma p-tau231 reached abnormal levels with the lowest Aβ burden. Plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 had the strongest association with Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) retention in early accumulating regions and associated with longitudinal increases in Aβ PET uptake in individuals without overt Aβ pathology at baseline. In summary, plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 better capture the earliest cerebral Aβ changes, before overt Aβ plaque pathology is present, and are promising blood biomarkers to enrich a preclinical population for Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W4293298399,"Tough bioadhesion has important implications in engineering and medicine but remains challenging to form and control. We report an ultrasound (US)–mediated strategy to achieve tough bioadhesion with controllability and fatigue resistance. Without chemical reaction, the US can amplify the adhesion energy and interfacial fatigue threshold between hydrogels and porcine skin by up to 100 and 10 times. Combined experiments and theoretical modeling suggest that the key mechanism is US-induced cavitation, which propels and immobilizes anchoring primers into tissues with mitigated barrier effects. Our strategy achieves spatial patterning of tough bioadhesion, on-demand detachment, and transdermal drug delivery. This work expands the material repertoire for tough bioadhesion and enables bioadhesive technologies with high-level controllability."
https://openalex.org/W4291016546,"The SARS-CoV-2 Delta (Pango lineage B.1.617.2) variant of concern spread globally, causing resurgences of COVID-19 worldwide1,2. The emergence of the Delta variant in the UK occurred on the background of a heterogeneous landscape of immunity and relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Here we analyse 52,992 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from England together with 93,649 genomes from the rest of the world to reconstruct the emergence of Delta and quantify its introduction to and regional dissemination across England in the context of changing travel and social restrictions. Using analysis of human movement, contact tracing and virus genomic data, we find that the geographic focus of the expansion of Delta shifted from India to a more global pattern in early May 2021. In England, Delta lineages were introduced more than 1,000 times and spread nationally as non-pharmaceutical interventions were relaxed. We find that hotel quarantine for travellers reduced onward transmission from importations; however, the transmission chains that later dominated the Delta wave in England were seeded before travel restrictions were introduced. Increasing inter-regional travel within England drove the nationwide dissemination of Delta, with some cities receiving more than 2,000 observable lineage introductions from elsewhere. Subsequently, increased levels of local population mixing-and not the number of importations-were associated with the faster relative spread of Delta. The invasion dynamics of Delta depended on spatial heterogeneity in contact patterns, and our findings will inform optimal spatial interventions to reduce the transmission of current and future variants of concern, such as Omicron (Pango lineage B.1.1.529)."
https://openalex.org/W4290960693,"CRISPR-Cas13 systems have recently been used for targeted RNA degradation in various organisms. However, collateral degradation of bystander RNAs has limited their in vivo applications. Here, we design a dual-fluorescence reporter system for detecting collateral effects and screening Cas13 variants in mammalian cells. Among over 200 engineered variants, several Cas13 variants including Cas13d and Cas13X exhibit efficient on-target activity but markedly reduced collateral activity. Furthermore, transcriptome-wide off-targets and cell growth arrest induced by Cas13 are absent for these variants. High-fidelity Cas13 variants show similar RNA knockdown activity to wild-type Cas13 but no detectable collateral damage in transgenic mice or adeno-associated-virus-mediated somatic cell targeting. Thus, high-fidelity Cas13 variants with minimal collateral effects are now available for targeted degradation of RNAs in basic research and therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W4226296514,"Quantum information, communication, and sensing rely on the generation and control of quantum correlations in complementary degrees of freedom. Free electrons coupled to photonics promise novel hybrid quantum technologies, although single-particle correlations and entanglement have yet to be shown. In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of electron-photon pair states using the phase-matched interaction of free electrons with the evanescent vacuum field of a photonic chip-based optical microresonator. Spontaneous inelastic scattering produces intracavity photons coincident with energy-shifted electrons, which we employ for noise-suppressed optical mode imaging. This parametric pair-state preparation will underpin the future development of free-electron quantum optics, providing a route to quantum-enhanced imaging, electron-photon entanglement, and heralded single-electron and Fock-state photon sources."
https://openalex.org/W4290973104,"Mammalian genomes have multiple enhancers spanning an ultralong distance (&gt;megabases) to modulate important genes, but it is unclear how these enhancers coordinate to achieve this task. We combine multiplexed CRISPRi screening with machine learning to define quantitative enhancer-enhancer interactions. We find that the ultralong distance enhancer network has a nested multilayer architecture that confers functional robustness of gene expression. Experimental characterization reveals that enhancer epistasis is maintained by three-dimensional chromosomal interactions and BRD4 condensation. Machine learning prediction of synergistic enhancers provides an effective strategy to identify noncoding variant pairs associated with pathogenic genes in diseases beyond genome-wide association studies analysis. Our work unveils nested epistasis enhancer networks, which can better explain enhancer functions within cells and in diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4290973386,The shape of a plant's root system influences its ability to reach essential nutrients in the soil and to acquire water during drought. Progress in engineering plant roots to optimize water and nutrient acquisition has been limited by our capacity to design and build genetic programs that alter root growth in a predictable manner. We developed a collection of synthetic transcriptional regulators for plants that can be compiled to create genetic circuits. These circuits control gene expression by performing Boolean logic operations and can be used to predictably alter root structure. This work demonstrates the potential of synthetic genetic circuits to control gene expression across tissues and reprogram plant growth.
https://openalex.org/W4292871234,"The catalytic asymmetric construction of Csp3-Csp3 bonds remains one of the foremost challenges in organic synthesis1. Metal-catalysed cross-electrophile couplings (XECs) have emerged as a powerful tool for C-C bond formation2-5. However, coupling two distinct Csp3 electrophiles with high cross-selectivity and stereoselectivity continues as an unmet challenge. Here we report a highly chemoselective and enantioselective Csp3-Csp3 XEC between alkyl halides and nitroalkanes catalysed by flavin-dependent 'ene'-reductases (EREDs). Photoexcitation of the enzyme-templated charge-transfer complex between an alkyl halide and a flavin cofactor enables the chemoselective reduction of alkyl halide over the thermodynamically favoured nitroalkane partner. The key C-C bond-forming step occurs by means of the reaction of an alkyl radical with an in situ-generated nitronate to form a nitro radical anion that collapses to form nitrite and an alkyl radical. An enzyme-controlled hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) affords high levels of enantioselectivity. This reactivity is unknown in small-molecule catalysis and highlights the potential for enzymes to use new mechanisms to address long-standing synthetic challenges."
https://openalex.org/W4292488390,"Abstract Richter transformation (RT) is a paradigmatic evolution of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) into a very aggressive large B cell lymphoma conferring a dismal prognosis. The mechanisms driving RT remain largely unknown. We characterized the whole genome, epigenome and transcriptome, combined with single-cell DNA/RNA-sequencing analyses and functional experiments, of 19 cases of CLL developing RT. Studying 54 longitudinal samples covering up to 19 years of disease course, we uncovered minute subclones carrying genomic, immunogenetic and transcriptomic features of RT cells already at CLL diagnosis, which were dormant for up to 19 years before transformation. We also identified new driver alterations, discovered a new mutational signature (SBS-RT), recognized an oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) high –B cell receptor (BCR) low -signaling transcriptional axis in RT and showed that OXPHOS inhibition reduces the proliferation of RT cells. These findings demonstrate the early seeding of subclones driving advanced stages of cancer evolution and uncover potential therapeutic targets for RT."
https://openalex.org/W4292242012,"Global guidelines for the management of high-cardiovascular-risk patients include aggressive goals for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Statin therapy alone is often insufficient to reach goals and nonstatin options have limitations. Here, we tested the lipid-lowering effects of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor drug obicetrapib in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in dyslipidaemic patients (n = 120, median LDL-C 88 mg dl−1) with background high-intensity statin treatment (NCT04753606). Over the course of 8 weeks, treatment with 5 mg or 10 mg obicetrapib resulted in a significant decrease as compared with placebo in median LDL-C concentration (by up to 51%; P < 0.0001), the primary trial outcome. As compared with placebo, obicetrapib treatment also significantly (P < 0.0001) decreased apolipoprotein B (by up to 30%) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) concentration (by up to 44%), and significantly (P < 0.0001) increased HDL-C concentration (by up to 165%; the secondary trial outcomes) and had an acceptable safety profile. These results support the potential of obicetrapib to address an unmet medical need for high-cardiovascular-risk patients. In a phase 2 randomized clinical trial, an inhibitor of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), obicetrapib, lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when administered in conjunction with high-intensity statins, paving the way for studies investigating the effects of obicetrapib on cardiovascular events."
https://openalex.org/W4292865342,"Characterization of genetic regulatory variants acting on livestock gene expression is essential for interpreting the molecular mechanisms underlying traits of economic value and for increasing the rate of genetic gain through artificial selection. Here we build a Cattle Genotype-Tissue Expression atlas (CattleGTEx) as part of the pilot phase of the Farm animal GTEx (FarmGTEx) project for the research community based on 7,180 publicly available RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) samples. We describe the transcriptomic landscape of more than 100 tissues/cell types and report hundreds of thousands of genetic associations with gene expression and alternative splicing for 23 distinct tissues. We evaluate the tissue-sharing patterns of these genetic regulatory effects, and functionally annotate them using multiomics data. Finally, we link gene expression in different tissues to 43 economically important traits using both transcriptome-wide association and colocalization analyses to decipher the molecular regulatory mechanisms underpinning such agronomic traits in cattle."
https://openalex.org/W4292865746,"Visual impairment from corneal stromal disease affects millions worldwide. We describe a cell-free engineered corneal tissue, bioengineered porcine construct, double crosslinked (BPCDX) and a minimally invasive surgical method for its implantation. In a pilot feasibility study in India and Iran (clinicaltrials.gov no. NCT04653922 ), we implanted BPCDX in 20 advanced keratoconus subjects to reshape the native corneal stroma without removing existing tissue or using sutures. During 24 months of follow-up, no adverse event was observed. We document improvements in corneal thickness (mean increase of 209 ± 18 µm in India, 285 ± 99 µm in Iran), maximum keratometry (mean decrease of 13.9 ± 7.9 D in India and 11.2 ± 8.9 D in Iran) and visual acuity (to a mean contact-lens-corrected acuity of 20/26 in India and spectacle-corrected acuity of 20/58 in Iran). Fourteen of 14 initially blind subjects had a final mean best-corrected vision (spectacle or contact lens) of 20/36 and restored tolerance to contact lens wear. This work demonstrates restoration of vision using an approach that is potentially equally effective, safer, simpler and more broadly available than donor cornea transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W4292870483,"We explored human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from different tissues to gain insights into genomic integrity at single-nucleotide resolution. We used genome sequencing data from two large hiPSC repositories involving 696 hiPSCs and daughter subclones. We find ultraviolet light (UV)-related damage in ~72% of skin fibroblast-derived hiPSCs (F-hiPSCs), occasionally resulting in substantial mutagenesis (up to 15 mutations per megabase). We demonstrate remarkable genomic heterogeneity between independent F-hiPSC clones derived during the same round of reprogramming due to oligoclonal fibroblast populations. In contrast, blood-derived hiPSCs (B-hiPSCs) had fewer mutations and no UV damage but a high prevalence of acquired BCOR mutations (26.9% of lines). We reveal strong selection pressure for BCOR mutations in F-hiPSCs and B-hiPSCs and provide evidence that they arise in vitro. Directed differentiation of hiPSCs and RNA sequencing showed that BCOR mutations have functional consequences. Our work strongly suggests that detailed nucleotide-resolution characterization is essential before using hiPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W4293298255,"Postmeiotic spermatids use a unique strategy to coordinate gene expression with morphological transformation, in which transcription and translation take place at separate developmental stages, but how mRNAs stored as translationally inert messenger ribonucleoproteins in developing spermatids become activated remains largely unknown. Here, we report that the RNA binding protein FXR1, a member of the fragile X-related (FXR) family, is highly expressed in late spermatids and undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to merge messenger ribonucleoprotein granules with the translation machinery to convert stored mRNAs into a translationally activated state. Germline-specific Fxr1 ablation in mice impaired the translation of target mRNAs and caused defective spermatid development and male infertility, and a phase separation-deficient FXR1L351P mutation in Fxr1 knock-in mice produced the same developmental defect. These findings uncover a mechanism for translational reprogramming with LLPS as a key driver in spermiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4293298244,"Fluorinated analogs of polyhedral hydrocarbons have been predicted to localize an electron within their cages upon reduction. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of perfluorocubane, a stable polyhedral fluorocarbon. The key to the successful synthesis was the efficient introduction of multiple fluorine atoms to cubane by liquid-phase reaction with fluorine gas. The solid-state structure of perfluorocubane was confirmed using x-ray crystallography, and its electron-accepting character was corroborated electrochemically and spectroscopically. The radical anion of perfluorocubane was examined by matrix-isolation electron spin resonance spectroscopy, which revealed that the unpaired electron accepted by perfluorocubane is located predominantly inside the cage."
https://openalex.org/W4291961176,"Controlling interfaces of phase-separating fluid mixtures is key to the creation of diverse functional soft materials. Traditionally, this is accomplished with surface-modifying chemical agents. Using experiment and theory, we studied how mechanical activity shapes soft interfaces that separate an active and a passive fluid. Chaotic flows in the active fluid give rise to giant interfacial fluctuations and noninertial propagating active waves. At high activities, stresses disrupt interface continuity and drive droplet generation, producing an emulsion-like active state composed of finite-sized droplets. When in contact with a solid boundary, active interfaces exhibit nonequilibrium wetting transitions, in which the fluid climbs the wall against gravity. These results demonstrate the promise of mechanically driven interfaces for creating a new class of soft active matter."
https://openalex.org/W4292338021,"Axon regeneration holds great promise for neural repair of CNS axonopathies, including glaucoma. Pten deletion in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) promotes potent optic nerve regeneration, but only a small population of Pten-null RGCs are actually regenerating RGCs (regRGCs); most surviving RGCs (surRGCs) remain non-regenerative. Here, we developed a strategy to specifically label and purify regRGCs and surRGCs, respectively, from the same Pten-deletion mice after optic nerve crush, in which they differ only in their regeneration capability. Smart-Seq2 single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed novel regeneration-associated genes that significantly promote axon regeneration. The most potent of these, Anxa2, acts synergistically with its ligand tPA in Pten-deletion-induced axon regeneration. Anxa2, its downstream effector ILK, and Mpp1 dramatically protect RGC somata and axons and preserve visual function in a clinically relevant model of glaucoma, demonstrating the exciting potential of this innovative strategy to identify novel effective neural repair candidates."
https://openalex.org/W4293298349,"Human speech production obeys the same acoustic principles as vocal production in other animals but has distinctive features: A stable vocal source is filtered by rapidly changing formant frequencies. To understand speech evolution, we examined a wide range of primates, combining observations of phonation with mathematical modeling. We found that source stability relies upon simplifications in laryngeal anatomy, specifically the loss of air sacs and vocal membranes. We conclude that the evolutionary loss of vocal membranes allows human speech to mostly avoid the spontaneous nonlinear phenomena and acoustic chaos common in other primate vocalizations. This loss allows our larynx to produce stable, harmonic-rich phonation, ideally highlighting formant changes that convey most phonetic information. Paradoxically, the increased complexity of human spoken language thus followed simplification of our laryngeal anatomy."

https://openalex.org/W4293298340,"Each year, trillions of insects make long-range seasonal migrations. These movements are relatively well understood at a population level, but how individual insects achieve them remains elusive. Behavioral responses to conditions en route are little studied, primarily owing to the challenges of tracking individual insects. Using a light aircraft and individual radio tracking, we show that nocturnally migrating death’s-head hawkmoths maintain control of their flight trajectories over long distances. The moths did not just fly with favorable tailwinds; during a given night, they also adjusted for head and crosswinds to precisely hold course. This behavior indicates that the moths use a sophisticated internal compass to maintain seasonally beneficial migratory trajectories independent of wind conditions, illuminating how insects traverse long distances to take advantage of seasonal resources."
https://openalex.org/W4292865316,"The genome of a eukaryotic cell is often vulnerable to both intrinsic and extrinsic threats owing to its constant exposure to a myriad of heterogeneous compounds. Despite the availability of innate DNA damage responses, some genomic lesions trigger malignant transformation of cells. Accurate prediction of carcinogens is an ever-challenging task owing to the limited information about bona fide (non-)carcinogens. We developed Metabokiller, an ensemble classifier that accurately recognizes carcinogens by quantitatively assessing their electrophilicity, their potential to induce proliferation, oxidative stress, genomic instability, epigenome alterations, and anti-apoptotic response. Concomitant with the carcinogenicity prediction, Metabokiller is fully interpretable and outperforms existing best-practice methods for carcinogenicity prediction. Metabokiller unraveled potential carcinogenic human metabolites. To cross-validate Metabokiller predictions, we performed multiple functional assays using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human cells with two Metabokiller-flagged human metabolites, namely 4-nitrocatechol and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and observed high synergy between Metabokiller predictions and experimental validations. Metabokiller is a novel, explainable AI-backed method for carcinogenicity prediction that leverages the biological and chemical properties associated with carcinogens."
https://openalex.org/W4293677675,"Hybridization between diverging lineages is associated with the generation and loss of species diversity, introgression, adaptation, and changes in reproductive mode, but it is unknown when and why it results in these divergent outcomes. We estimate a comprehensive evolutionary network for the largest group of unisexual vertebrates and use it to understand the evolutionary outcomes of hybridization. Our results show that rates of introgression between species decrease with time since divergence and suggest that species must attain a threshold of evolutionary divergence before hybridization results in transitions to unisexuality. Rates of hybridization also predict genome-wide patterns of genetic diversity in whiptail lizards. These results distinguish among models for hybridization that have not previously been tested and suggest that the evolutionary outcomes can be predictable."
https://openalex.org/W4290703693,"Hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN) is an antimicrobial oxidant produced from hydrogen peroxide and thiocyanate anions by heme peroxidases in secretory fluids such as in the human respiratory tract. Some respiratory tract pathogens display tolerance to this oxidant, which suggests that there might be therapeutic value in targeting HOSCN defense mechanisms. However, surprisingly little is known about how bacteria protect themselves from HOSCN. We hypothesized that tolerant pathogens have a flavoprotein disulfide reductase that uses NAD(P)H to directly reduce HOSCN, similar to thioredoxin reductase in mammalian cells. Here, we report the discovery of a previously uncharacterized flavoprotein disulfide reductase with HOSCN reductase activity, which we term Har (hypothiocyanous acid reductase), in Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterium previously found to be tolerant of HOSCN. S. pneumoniae generates large amounts of hydrogen peroxide that can be converted to HOSCN in the respiratory tract. Using deletion mutants, we demonstrate that the HOSCN reductase is dispensable for growth of S. pneumoniae in the presence of lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate. However, bacterial growth in the HOSCN-generating system was completely crippled when deletion of HOSCN reductase activity was combined with disruption of GSH import or recycling.

How S. pneumoniae survives this microbicidal secondary oxidant has been largely overlooked.We recently reported that S. pneumoniae is relatively tolerant of HOSCN, when compared with another respiratory microbe Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20Shearer H.L. Kaldor C.D. Hua H. Kettle A.J. Parker H.A. Hampton M.B. Resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to hypothiocyanous acid generated by host peroxidases.Infect. Immun. 2022; 90e0053021Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This raises the question as to what mechanisms are responsible for HOSCN tolerance. We first investigated the contribution of the low molecular weight thiol GSH in S. pneumoniae (21Shearer H.L. Paton J.C. Hampton M.B. Dickerhof N. Glutathione utilization protects Streptococcus pneumoniae against lactoperoxidase-derived hypothiocyanous acid.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2022; 179: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The genes required for the biosynthesis of GSH are absent in S. pneumoniae, so the bacteria rely on its import from their environment (22Potter A.J. Trappetti C. Paton J.C. Streptococcus pneumoniae uses glutathione to defend against oxidative stress and metal ion toxicity.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 6248-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Lanie J.A. Ng W.L.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3641-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The ability to import and recycle GSH was shown to be important for the ability of S. pneumoniae to cope with HOSCN; however, even when they lacked GSH, the bacteria could still survive HOSCN exposure for up to 1 h. Also, they were able to grow, albeit more slowly, in the presence of LPO, where in the presence of SCN−, bacterially produced H2O2 is converted to HOSCN (21Shearer H.L. Paton J.C. Hampton M.B. Dickerhof N. Glutathione utilization protects Streptococcus pneumoniae against lactoperoxidase-derived hypothiocyanous acid.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2022; 179: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). These findings suggested the presence of additional HOSCN protective mechanisms in S. pneumoniae.HOSCN is known to be well tolerated by mammalian cells, owing to the presence of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), a flavoprotein disulfide reductase (FDR) that can directly reduce HOSCN using NADPH (25Chandler J.D. Nichols D.P. Nick J.A. Hondal R.J. Day B.J. Selective metabolism of hypothiocyanous acid by mammalian thioredoxin reductase promotes lung innate immunity and antioxidant defense.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 18421-18428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an enzyme that consumes NAD(P)H in the presence of HOSCN has also been reported for streptococcal species present in human oral cavities (26Carlsson J. Iwami Y. Yamada T. Hydrogen peroxide excretion by oral streptococci and effect of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide.Infect. Immun. 1983; 40: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The HOSCN oxidoreductase activity was correlated with the ability of oral streptococci to recover from exposure to HOSCN in vitro (26Carlsson J. Iwami Y. Yamada T. Hydrogen peroxide excretion by oral streptococci and effect of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide.Infect. Immun. 1983; 40: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because SCN− levels reach low millimolar levels (17Schultz C.P. Ahmed M.K. Dawes C. Mantsch H.H. Thiocyanate levels in human saliva: quantitation by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.Anal.

The aim of the present study was to identify enzymes in S. pneumoniae with HOSCN reductase activity and to determine if they have any role in protecting this serious human pathogen from HOSCN.ResultsEvidence for reduction of HOSCN by an FDR in S. pneumoniaeTo investigate whether S. pneumoniae has an enzyme that uses NADPH to reduce HOSCN, we added NADPH to bacterial lysates and observed its consumption by the loss of absorbance at 340 nm upon the addition of HOSCN (Fig. 1A). NADH was also oxidized when HOSCN was added to lysates (Fig. 1B), and NAD(P)H consumption was not observed when either lysate or HOSCN was omitted from the reaction mixture (Fig. 1, A and B). NADH was consumed 20-fold faster than NADPH and while its consumption was significantly higher in the presence of HOSCN, it was also rapidly oxidized in the absence of HOSCN (Fig. 1B). NADH consumption in the absence of oxidant is possibly because of the oxygen-reducing NADH oxidase present in S. pneumoniae (27Auzat I. Chapuy-Regaud S. Le Bras G. Dos Santos D. Ogunniyi A.D. Le Thomas I. et al.The NADH oxidase of Streptococcus pneumoniae: its involvement in competence and virulence.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1018-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).To confirm that HOSCN reduction was occurring in this system, we monitored the rate of HOSCN decline in S. pneumoniae lysates (Fig. 1, C and D). There was no significant difference between the rates of HOSCN and NADPH consumption measured concurrently on the same lysates (0.11 ± 0.03 and 0.09 ± 0.01 μM/min/mg, mean ± SD; n = 4; paired two-tailed t test). As a control, no appreciable loss of HOSCN was observed over the same period in the absence of the bacterial lysate or NADPH (Fig. 1, C and D). Lysates consumed HOSCN slightly more rapidly in the presence of NADH instead of NADPH (0.15 ± 0.02 versus 0.09 ± 0.01, mean ± SD, p < 0.01, unpaired two-tailed t test).Varying the concentrations of HOSCN and NADPH at fixed concentrations of either NADPH (200 μM) or HOSCN (100 μM), respectively, produced Michaelis–Menten saturation curves consistent with an enzymatic reduction of HOSCN by NADPH (Fig. 1, E and F). The apparent KM values for HOSCN and NADPH added to lysates were 5 (2.5–9.0, 95% confidence interval) and 107 (76–151) μM and the Vmax 0.12 (0.1–0.14) and 0.13 (0.12–0.15) μM/min/mg, respectively. When no NADPH was added, HOSCN was still consumed at approximately 15% of the maximal measured rate, which is likely facilitated by endogenous NAD(P)H present in the lysates.HOSCN oxidizes GSH to GSSG, which is reduced by glutathione reductase (GR) at the expense of NADPH (21Shearer H.L. Paton J.C. Hampton M.B. Dickerhof N. Glutathione utilization protects Streptococcus pneumoniae against lactoperoxidase-derived hypothiocyanous acid.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2022; 179: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 22Potter A.J. Trappetti C. Paton J.C. Streptococcus pneumoniae uses glutathione to defend against oxidative stress and metal ion toxicity.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 6248-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To test whether the observed NADPH consumption in response to HOSCN in S. pneumoniae lysates was mediated by GSH, we used ΔgshT and Δgor mutants of S. pneumoniae, which lack GSH or GR, respectively (22Potter A.J. Trappetti C. Paton J.C. Streptococcus pneumoniae uses glutathione to defend against oxidative stress and metal ion toxicity.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 6248-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). NADPH utilization still occurred in lysates from the mutant strains, indeed to a greater extent than in WT, indicating that it was independent of GSH oxidation and recycling by the GR system (Fig. 2A). To rule out that the observed HOSCN reductase activity involved another low molecular weight thiol such as coenzyme A, we passed lysates through a centrifugal filter with a molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 3 kDa and demonstrated that NADPH consumption in response to HOSCN still occurred in the retentate (Fig. 2B). Next, we tested the involvement of TrxR in reducing HOSCN in bacterial lysates as mammalian TrxR is known to have HOSCN reductase activity (25Chandler J.D. Nichols D.P. Nick J.A. Hondal R.J. Day B.J. Selective metabolism of hypothiocyanous acid by mammalian thioredoxin reductase promotes lung innate immunity and antioxidant defense.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 18421-18428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The TrxR inhibitor auranofin did not affect HOSCN reductase activity in S. pneumoniae lysates when added at 20 μM (Fig. 2B), despite having previously been shown to inhibit recombinant bacterial TrxR at a 25-fold lower concentration (28Harbut M.B. Vilchèze C. Luo X. Hensler M.E. Guo H. Yang B. et al.Auranofin exerts broad-spectrum bactericidal activities by targeting thiol-redox homeostasis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 4453-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Similarly, the activity was not inhibited by 500 μM of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (Fig. 2B), a thiol-alkylating reagent that reacts preferentially with TrxR rather than with GSH and fully inhibits human TrxR at 100 μM (29Arner E.S. Bjornstedt M. Holmgren A. 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is an irreversible inhibitor of human thioredoxin reductase.

A, reductase activity in lysates from S. pneumoniae WT, GSH transporter substrate-binding protein, and glutathione reductase mutants (ΔgshT and Δgor) was measured as described for Figure 1, A and B. B, lysates from WT S. pneumoniae were passed through a MWCO 3 kDa centrifugal filter before measuring the reductase activity of the filter retentate. Auranofin (20 μM) and DNCB (500 μM) were preincubated with WT lysates for 5 min in the presence of NADPH before measuring the reductase activity. Reductase activity in each case was expressed relative to that obtained for untreated lysate. Each symbol represents a separate experiment using lysates obtained from independent cultures, and the bar is the mean ± SD.

FDRs, such as GR or TrxR, shuttle electrons from NADPH to a tightly bound flavin adenine dinucleotide and then to a redox-active disulfide (Fig. 3A). One of the two resulting reduced thiols then reacts with an oxidized substrate, for example, GSSG or oxidized thioredoxin, to form a mixed disulfide. Subsequent reaction with the adjacent active site thiol results in regeneration of the active site disulfide and release of the reduced substrate (Fig. 3A). HOSCN reacts with thiols to produce sulfenyl thiocyanate derivatives (30Aune T.M. Thomas E.L. Oxidation of protein sulfhydryls by products of peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of thiocyanate ion.Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 31Thomas E.L. Aune T.M. Lactoperoxidase, peroxide, thiocyanate antimicrobial system: correlation of sulfhydryl oxidation with antimicrobial action.Infect. Immun. 1978; 20: 456-463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that in the case of a HOSCN reductase, a sulfenyl thiocyanate intermediate is formed, which is then attacked by the other active site thiol resulting in the release of SCN− (Fig. 3A). S. pneumoniae lysates lost their ability to consume NADPH in response to HOSCN when they were boiled or passed over Cibacron Blue beads, an affinity absorbent for proteins with a dinucleotide fold (32Thompson S.T. Cass K.H. Stellwagen E. Blue dextran-sepharose: an affinity column for the dinucleotide fold in proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). These results suggested that HOSCN reduction was due to a heat-sensitive enzyme with a dinucleotide-binding site. To further probe the involvement of an FDR-type reduction mechanism, any potential thiol-containing FDR substrates were alkylated with iodoacetamide (IAM), rendering them unavailable for oxidation by HOSCN. For this, S. pneumoniae lysates were incubated with IAM prior to monitoring reductase activity (Fig. 3B). Only a partial inhibition by IAM (25%) was observed when it was incubated with S. pneumoniae lysates for 10 min prior to the addition of NADPH and HOSCN, and this effect was not significant. In contrast, the alkylating reagent significantly inhibited the reductase activity when it was coincubated with the lysate in the presence of NADPH to generate the IAM-reactive di–thiol state in the active site (Fig. 3, A and B). These results are consistent with the direct reduction of HOSCN by an FDR (Fig. 3A).Figure 3Reduction of HOSCN by a flavoprotein disulfide reductase (FDR) present in Streptococcus pneumoniae. A, proposed mechanism for the reduction of HOSCN analogous to other known FDRs, in which NADPH reduces the tightly bound flavin adenine dinucleotide, which transfers electrons to a redox-active disulfide present in the conserved CXXXC motif. In the case of low molecular weight thiol disulfide reductases or TrxR, the thus reduced N-terminal thiol can undergo a dithiol-disulfide exchange reaction with a bound oxidized substrate RS-SR (e.g., GSSG or oxidized thioredoxin). We propose that in the case of a HOSCN reductase, the thiol reacts with HOSCN to form a sulfenyl thiocyanate intermediate, which is then attacked by the C-terminal thiol to generate the disulfide resulting in the release of SCN−. B, consumption of 200 μM NADPH by S. pneumoniae lysates in the absence of oxidant (lysate alone) and after the addition of 100 μM H2O2 or HOSCN. Lysates were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C or incubated with Cibacron (C) Blue agarose beads before measuring reductase activity of the boiled lysates and bead supernatant in response to 100 μM HOSCN. IAM (20 mM) was preincubated with the lysates for 10 min in the presence of NADPH before measuring the reductase activity. IAM# (20 mM) and lysates were preincubated for 10 min in the absence of NADPH before monitoring the reductase activity. NADPH consumption, that is, reductase activity, in each case was expressed relative to that obtained for the control system (untreated lysate, 100 μM HOSCN). Each symbol represents a separate experiment using lysates obtained from independent cultures and the bar the mean ± SD.

NADPH consumption in S. pneumoniae lysates was not observed in response to H2O2 (Fig. 3B). MPO can use H2O2 not only to produce HOSCN but also to oxidize chloride to the potent bactericidal hypochlorous acid (HOCl) (14van Dalen C.J. Whitehouse M.W. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J.

Attempts at eluting the activity off the beads using high salt, NADPH, and/or flavin adenine dinucleotide were unsuccessful. Instead, we directly loaded the beads onto an SDS-PAGE gel and following Coomassie staining, excised the protein bands for in-gel tryptic digestion and LC–MS/MS analysis (Fig. S2). Numerous proteins were identified when searching the peptide spectra against the S. pneumoniae proteome using database search engines (Supporting information, Protein hits.xlsx). Protein hits were manually filtered for enzymes with oxidoreductase activity, provided they had a high confidence score and the predicted molecular weight was consistent with their position on the SDS-PAGE gel (Table S1). Our IAM results suggested that a redox active disulfide was involved in the reduction of HOSCN. Of the shortlisted oxidoreductases, only an uncharacterized class I pyridine nucleotide reductase, GR and TrxR, belong to the family of FDRs, the latter two of which we had already ruled out using inhibitors and mutant bacteria. The class I pyridine nucleotide reductase that appeared in band 8 (37–50 kDa) is encoded by gene SPD_1415 in S. pneumoniae strain D39. In the S. pneumoniae TIGR4 and R6 strains, this gene is annotated as SP1588 and spr1442, respectively. To confirm that the enzyme encoded by S. pneumoniae strain D39 gene SPD_1415 is responsible for the HOSCN reductase measured in lysates, we targeted the gene for deletion. This was done by replacing the gene with a spectinomycin resistance gene using overlap extension PCR (Fig. S3A) (36Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Gene splicing by overlap extension.Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Genetic replacement was confirmed by restriction digest (Fig. S3B) and sequencing (Fig. S4). Lysates of the constructed S. pneumoniae mutant strain no longer consumed NADPH in response to HOSCN confirming that a HOSCN reductase is encoded by this gene (Fig. 4A). We therefore named the gene har and the protein it encodes Har (hypothiocyanous acid reductase).Figure 4Deletion of the SPD_1415/har gene encoding a putative flavoprotein disulfide reductase (FDR) abolishes HOSCN reductase activity in Streptococcus pneumoniae and in combination with compromised GSH utilization abolishes growth in the presence of the LPO/SCN− system.

While the bulk of the primary tumor is eliminated upon exposure to chemotherapeutic treatment, residual cancer cells and non-transformed cells within the host can engage a stable cell cycle exit program named senescence. Senescent cells secrete a distinct set of pro-inflammatory factors, collectively termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Upon exposure to the SASP, cancer cells undergo cellular plasticity resulting in increased proliferation, migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. The molecular mechanisms by which the SASP regulates these pro-tumorigenic features are poorly understood. Here, we report that breast cancer cells exposed to the SASP strongly upregulate Lipocalin-2 (LCN2). Furthermore, we demonstrate that LCN2 is critical for SASP-induced increased migration in breast cancer cells, and its inactivation potentiates the response to chemotherapeutic treatment in mouse models of breast cancer. Finally, we show that neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment leads to LCN2 upregulation in residual human breast tumors, and correlates with worse overall survival. These findings provide the foundation for targeting LCN2 as an adjuvant therapeutic approach to prevent the emergence of aggressive tumors following chemotherapy."

Speckled Protein 140 (SP140) is an immune-restricted PHD and bromodomain-containing epigenetic “reader,” and SP140 loss-of-function mutations associate with Crohn’s disease (CD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, the relevance of these mutations and mechanisms underlying SP140-driven pathogenicity remains unexplored. Using a global proteomic strategy, we identified SP140 as a repressor of topoisomerases (TOPs) that maintains heterochromatin and macrophage fate. In humans and mice, SP140 loss resulted in unleashed TOP activity, de-repression of developmentally silenced genes, and ultimately defective microbe-inducible macrophage transcriptional programs and bacterial killing that drive intestinal pathology. Pharmacological inhibition of TOP1/2 rescued these defects. Furthermore, exacerbated colitis was restored with TOP1/2 inhibitors in Sp140−/− mice, but not wild-type mice, in vivo. Collectively, we identify SP140 as a TOP repressor and reveal repurposing of TOP inhibition to reverse immune diseases driven by SP140 loss."
https://openalex.org/W4291008483,"Kmeans clustering algorithm is an iterative unsupervised learning algorithm that tries to partition the given dataset into k pre-defined distinct non-overlapping clusters where each data point belongs to only one group. However, its performance is affected by its sensitivity to the initial cluster centroids with the possibility of convergence into local optimum and specification of cluster number as the input parameter. Recently, the hybridization of metaheuristics algorithms with the K-Means algorithm has been explored to address these problems and effectively improve the algorithm’s performance. Nonetheless, most metaheuristics algorithms require rigorous parameter tunning to achieve an optimum result. This paper proposes a hybrid clustering method that combines the well-known symbiotic organisms search algorithm with K-Means using the SOS as a global search metaheuristic for generating the optimum initial cluster centroids for the K-Means. The SOS algorithm is more of a parameter-free metaheuristic with excellent search quality that only requires initialising a single control parameter. The performance of the proposed algorithm is investigated by comparing it with the classical SOS, classical K-means and other existing hybrids clustering algorithms on eleven (11) UCI Machine Learning Repository datasets and one artificial dataset. The results from the extensive computational experimentation show improved performance of the hybrid SOSK-Means for solving automatic clustering compared to the standard K-Means, symbiotic organisms search clustering methods and other hybrid clustering approaches."

Tight junctions are molecular gatekeepers that regulate transport of small molecules through the paracellular spaces between adjoining cells in endothelia and epithelia.

Unlike other human diseases caused by C. perfringens toxins, CpE-associated ailments are not directly preventable nor treatable, and no vaccine exists against this food poisoning type (13Suzuki H.

Because spore-formed C. perfringens is heat-resistant, cooking does little to reduce its pathogenicity, as digested spores can produce CpE (14Duncan C.L. Strong D.H. Sebald M. Sporulation and enterotoxin production by mutants of Clostridium perfringens.J. Bacteriol. 1972; 110: 378-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, submolecular details into CpEs mechanisms of claudin binding and dissociating tight junction barriers are essential to elucidate CpE cytotoxicity and to develop therapeutic strategies for CpE-based diseases.The C-terminal domain of CpE (cCpE) selectively targets claudins in the gut by recognizing a motif unique to these receptors, then binds them with low nanomolar affinities (15Veshnyakova A.

This claudin-bound CpE, that is, “small complex”, then oligomerizes and its N-terminal domain structurally rearranges to form a membrane-penetrating and cytotoxic β-barrel pore (17Robertson S.L.

The process of β-pore formation disables claudin–claudin interactions vital to tight junction assembly and ultimately dissociates tight junctions causing paracellular leakage prior to CpE-induced cell death.

Yet, a complete structural and mechanistic understanding of CpE dissociation of tight junctions and the process of cytotoxic β-pore formation remains elusive.We intended to elucidate how CpE binds claudins and dissociates tight junctions by determining X-ray crystal structures of enterotoxins CpE or cCpE in complex with claudins but found crystallization to be a bottleneck. For most claudins, crystals did not form at all, while for those that formed crystals, it required screening and optimizing hundreds over ∼1 year to determine structures resolved to 3 to 4 Å (1Chiba H.

Using a phage display, library-encoding synthetic antigen-binding fragments (sFabs), we sought to discover molecules that target and bind complexes between enterotoxins and human claudin-4 (claudin-4). Our goal was to use sFabs to chaperone crystallization, improve initial diffraction, and increase structural throughput of this and other claudin–enterotoxin complexes (27Bukowska M.A. Grutter M.G. New concepts and aids to facilitate crystallization.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2013; 23: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Dominik P.K. Borowska M.T. Dalmas O. Kim S.S. Perozo E.

Through this approach, we surmised additional sFabs could discover that obstruct complex formation altogether and be useful in therapeutic development. During this process, three sFabs were discovered, which we termed CpE Obstructing Proteins (COPs). Preliminary characterization of COPs revealed that COP-2 and COP-3 had properties amenable for structure determination of the claudin-4–cCpE complex. Ultimately, however, we determined a structure of this complex using a traditional crystallography workflow (16Vecchio A.J. Rathnayake S.S. Stroud R.M.

U S A. 2021; 118e2024651118Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). But because sFabs have recently been shown effective for determining structures of small membrane proteins and complexes by cryo-EM, we used COP-2, COP-3, and cryo-EM to progress a novel workflow for higher throughput elucidation of claudin/enterotoxin structures (29Wu S.

Sci. USA. 2021; 118e2115435118Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar).Here, we qualitatively and quantitatively characterize COP-2 and COP-3 binding to claudin-4, cCpE, and CpE individually, and to claudin-4–enterotoxin complexes using biochemical and biophysical techniques. We also use cryo-EM at 200 kV to determine 4 to 7 Å structures of each 50 kDa COP bound to ∼35 kDa claudin-4–cCpE complexes in ∼1 month and employ these structures to create models of the cytotoxic CpE β-pore. Our findings reveal the structural basis and COP-specific mechanisms of COP targeting of claudin-4–cCpE complexes. This research independently validates claudin-4/cCpE structures determined by X-ray crystallography and provides a structural framework for preventing CpE-mediated cytotoxicity by obstructing toxin/receptor binding. Moreover, it advances development of technologies and establishes a general approach for determining structures of other claudin–enterotoxin complexes at moderate resolutions using accessible cryo-EM instrumentation that can readily be expanded to higher resolutions with 300 kV microscopes. Further, it demonstrates the antigenicity of CpE and cCpE enterotoxins and their claudin-bound complexes, which through intensified sFab development could generate novel sFabs useful for modulating tight junction barriers or as therapeutics for preventing or treating CpE-based illnesses in humans and domesticated animals.ResultsDevelopment of COPsClaudin-4 solubilized in n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM) and bound to cCpE was used as input for phage display selection using a large and diverse library of sFabs based on a humanized Fab scaffold. The sFab library has varied sequences that are biased for serine and tyrosine in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of their light (L) and heavy (H) chains within variable domains (32Fellouse F.A. Wiesmann C. Sidhu S.S. Synthetic antibodies from a four-amino-acid code: A dominant role for tyrosine in antigen recognition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 12467-12472Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 33Fellouse F.A. Esaki K. Birtalan S. Raptis D. Cancasci V.J. Koide A. et al.High-throughput generation of synthetic antibodies from highly functional minimalist phage-displayed libraries.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 924-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). After several rounds of selection to increase stringency, two sFabs, termed COP-2 and COP-3, were further developed and validated by ELISA to bind to claudin-4/cCpE. Both COPs were sequenced and isolated to characterize their binding further. Sequence alignments of COP-2 and COP-3 reveal that COP-2 and COP-3 share 98.2 and 93.3% sequence identity in their L and H chains, respectively; and that COP sequences diverge the greatest in CDR-L3, CDR-H1, and CDR-H3 (Supporting Information (SI) Fig. S1). These residue divergences may direct COP-specific recognition of claudin-4–cCpE complexes.Biochemical characterization of COPsTo obtain more detailed insights into COP recognition, we determined which molecule COPs bind and if they use unique or common epitopes. After expressing and purifying claudin-4, cCpE, CpE, and COPs, increases in molecular masses as assessed by decreases in peak retention times with size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used to qualitatively characterize COP-2 and COP-3 binding modes. After incubating COP-2 and COP-3 with claudin-4 and cCpE alone, we found that COPs did not bind claudin-4 but did form larger complexes with cCpE (Fig. 1, A and B). Incubating claudin-4, cCpE, and COPs together showed that cCpE binds claudin-4 and that both COPs bound claudin-4–cCpE complexes (Fig. 1C). No mass increases were observed for COPs incubated with CpE (Fig. 1D). Lastly, incubating claudin-4, CpE, and COPs together showed that while CpE binds claudin-4 and forms a “small complex”, the COPs do not bind “small complexes” (Fig. 1E). To verify complex formation, peaks from SEC were pooled and subjected to SDS-PAGE, which showed the presence of individual proteins from associated complexes (Fig. 1F). To determine if COPs share a binding epitope, we incubated COP-2 and COP-3 together with cCpE. If COPs bound distinct epitopes, a molecular mass shift greater than the individual cCpE–COP complex would result. SEC revealed no additive mass shift with both COPs present (Fig. 1B). These biochemical results suggest the specific molecular recognition of COPs and that COPs share binding epitopes.Biophysical characterization of COPsAfter qualitatively establishing COP binding, we quantitated the affinities and kinetics of COP interactions with claudin-4 and enterotoxins. We determined the second-order association rate constant (kon), first-order dissociation rate constant (koff), and equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of these interactions using bio-layer interferometry (BLI) (Table 1; SI Fig. S2). BLI measurements were made using preformed claudin-4–enterotoxin complexes or cCpE alone in DDM, replicating the conditions of the phage display selections. For COP-2 and COP-3 binding to claudin-4–cCpE complexes, we measured KDs of 52.3 and 98.4 nM, respectively. Comparing the binding rates revealed that COP-3 had 1.9- and 3.5-fold faster kon and koff rates than COP-2. The KDs of COP-2 and COP-3 to cCpE were 67.6 and 137.6 nM, respectively. Like COP-3 binding to claudin-4–cCpE complexes, the kon and koff rates were 1.4- and 2.1-fold faster than COP-2. Finally, we measured KDs of 7.8 and 9.1 μM for COP-2 and COP-3 binding to claudin-4/CpE “small complexes”, respectively. The KD values represent 149.1- and 92.0-fold decreases in COP-2 and COP-3 affinity for CpE compared to cCpE. Kinetic differences in kon and koff of COP binding to cCpE are visible in the BLI sensorgrams (SI Fig. S2). These results agree with biochemical assessment and reveal biophysical parameters unique to each COP that may influence recognition and binding to claudin-4–cCpE complexes.Table 1Affinities and kinetics of COP binding to claudin-4/cCpE and enterotoxinsCOPComplex/Proteinkon (1/Ms)koff (1/s)KD (nM)COP-2claudin-4/cCpE1.5x104 ± 0.1x1047.8x10−4 ± 0.6x10−452.3 ± 3.0cCpE7.2x103 ± 0.6x1034.8x10−4 ± 0.4x10−467.6 ± 11.7claudin-4/CpE1.5x102 ± 0.6x1021.2x10−3 ± 0.6x10−37800 ± 750COP-3claudin-4/cCpE2.9x104 ± 0.7x1042.7x10−3 ± 0.5x10−398.4 ± 11.0cCpE1.0x104 ± 0.1x1041.0x10−3 ± 0.1x10−3137.6 ± 6.2claudin-4/CpE1.2x103 ± 0.2x10310.8x10−2 ± 0.7x10−29050 ± 1300 Open table in a new tab Cryo-EM structures of claudin-4–cCpE–COP complexesHaving confirmed that COP-2 binds claudin-4–cCpE complexes using SEC (Fig. 2A) and BLI (Fig. 2B), we next delineated the structural basis and molecular mechanism of COP-2 targeting by determining its structure by cryo-EM. Cryo-EM screening of claudin-4–cCpE–COP-2 complexes that were SEC purified, pooled, and concentrated to 8.0 mg/ml in various detergents showed that those solubilized in 2,2-didecylpropane-1,3-bis-β-D-maltopyranoside (LMNG) were amenable to structure determination. This was confirmed by 2D classifications and ab initio 3D reconstructions, which revealed a stacked and linear arrangement of the three proteins, a canonical two-lobed sFab, and flexibility in COP-2’s constant domain (SI Fig. S3). Due to this flexibility, we used a data processing strategy that masked claudin-4, cCpE, and the variable domains of COP-2 to resolve and focus understanding on the interactions directing COP-2 recognition. Using this strategy, a cryo-EM map that was resolved to 6.9 Å was generated (SI Table S1). The map resolution was sufficient to reveal the claudin-4–cCpE–COP-2 complex, secondary structural elements including claudin-4’s four transmembrane helices (TM), and some bulky side chains (SI Fig. S4A). This cryo-EM map was used to build, refine, and determine a structure for the claudin-4–cCpE–COP-2 complex. SI Table S1 shows data processing, refinement, and model-to-map fit statistics, with further details given in Experimental procedures.Figure 2Structure and function of COP-2 binding to claudin-4–cCpE complexes.

Rathnayake S.S. Stroud R.M. Structural basis for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin targeting of claudins at tight junctions in mammalian gut.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2021; 118e2024651118Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Overall, however, the claudin-4/cCpE portion of this complex from cryo-EM superimposed well onto the crystal structure (SI Fig. S5A). We measured RMSDs in C⍺ positions of 2.0 and 1.4 Å between the cores of claudin-4 and cCpE and 1.7 Å in overall secondary structures between the cryo-EM and crystal structures of the claudin-4–cCpE complex, indicating no major conformational changes occur upon COP-2 binding. Generally, the claudin-4 extracellular segments (ECSs) are in similar conformations and thus may interact with cCpE similarly in the cryo-EM and crystal structures (SI Fig. S5A). Density corresponding to a loop within ECS2 that contains the NPLVA153 motif shows that the motif accesses a groove on the surface of cCpE. This interaction is known to impart high-affinity cCpE binding to claudins, and COP-2 appears to not significantly alter its structure (16Vecchio A.J. Rathnayake S.S. Stroud R.M. Structural basis for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin targeting of claudins at tight junctions in mammalian gut.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2021; 118e2024651118Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).The cryo-EM structure of the claudin-4–cCpE–COP-2 complex reveals the basis of COP-2 binding. The canonical binding of cCpE to claudin-4 exposes cCpE’s top half to COP-2 binding by providing an antigenic surface (Fig. 2C). COP-2 binding to cCpE alters the conformations of cCpE’s N-terminus, β-strands β5 and β6, and the loop connecting them, when compared to the crystal structure (SI Fig. S5A). COP-2’s L chain sits atop a depression on the exterior of cCpE formed between the N-terminus and strands β5 and β6 (Fig. 2C). Chain L’s CDR-L1, CDR-L2, and CDR-L3 conform to the surface of cCpE and potential side chains involved in these interactions can be visualized although not placed confidently (Fig. 4, A and B). COP-2’s chain H accesses the same surface depression as chain L but also flanks the opposite side of strands β5 and β6—CDR-H3 shares an epitope with chain L while CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 reside on the other (Fig. 2C and Fig. 4C). CDR-H3 splays outward to deeply penetrate its surface groove, conforming to the cCpE surface (Fig. 4D). Based on the interactions projected by the structure, we hypothesized that residues comprising Lys197 to Leu202 and Asn267 to Gln276 in cCpE could influence COP-2 binding.After verifying that COP-3 binds claudin-4–cCpE complexes using SEC (Fig. 3A) and BLI (Fig. 3B), we next determined a structure for COP-3 in complex with claudin-4/cCpE by cryo-EM to contrast its molecular mechanism of targeting with COP-2. Claudin-4–cCpE–COP-3 complexes in various membrane mimetics were SEC purified, pooled, and concentrated to 6.0 mg/ml for cryo-EM. Those complexes solubilized in amphipol were superior to LMNG and DDM for cryo-EM based on 2D class averages. The 2D and 3D classifications of the COP-3 complex showed a single complex with each protein stacked in a linear arrangement and had features corresponding to secondary structural elements and both lobes of COP-3 (SI Fig. S6). The 3D reconstructions showed that the constant domains of COP-3 are less dynamic than those of COP-2, but also that claudin-4’s TM region was less resolved in amphipol. We used a data processing strategy that masked COP-3 to best resolve the interactions directing its recognition of claudin-4/cCpE, which generated map (focused) that was resolved to 3.8 Å and showed structural features including density for bulky side chains (SI Table S1). However, this focused map lacked definition for cCpE and claudin-4, and model-to-map fit proved difficult. Therefore, data were processed with no mask, which produced a map (whole) that was resolved to 5.0 Å. The whole map resolved the claudin-4–cCpE–COP-3 complex, including secondary structural elements like claudin-4’s TMs, ⍺-helices and β-strands in cCpE, and the conformations of COP-3 CDRs (SI Fig. S4B). Initial model building and refinement employed both maps, but the final model was refined against the whole map, resulting in the cryo-EM structure for the claudin-4–cCpE–COP-3 complex. SI Table S1 shows data processing, refinement, and model-to-map fit statistics, with further details given in Experimental procedures.Figure 3Structure and function of COP-3 binding to claudin-4–cCpE complexes.

https://openalex.org/W4291020895,"Movement of organisms plays a fundamental role in the evolution and diversity of life. Animals typically move at an irregular pace over time and space, alternating among movement states. Understanding movement decisions and developing mechanistic models of animal distribution dynamics can thus be contingent to adequate discrimination of behavioral phases. Existing methods to disentangle movement states typically require a follow-up analysis to identify state-dependent drivers of animal movement, which overlooks statistical uncertainty that comes with the state delineation process. Here, we developed population-level, multi-state step selection functions (HMM-SSF) that can identify simultaneously the different behavioral bouts and the specific underlying behavior-habitat relationship. Using simulated data and relocation data from mule deer ( Odocoileus hemionus ), plains bison ( Bison bison bison ) and plains zebra ( Equus quagga ), we illustrated the HMM-SSF robustness, versatility, and predictive ability for animals involved in distinct behavioral processes: foraging, migrating and avoiding a nearby predator. Individuals displayed different habitat selection pattern during the encamped and the travelling phase. Some landscape attributes switched from being selected to avoided, depending on the movement phase. We further showed that HMM-SSF can detect multi-modes of movement triggered by predators, with prey switching to the travelling phase when predators are in close vicinity. HMM-SSFs thus can be used to gain a mechanistic understanding of how animals use their environment in relation to the complex interplay between their needs to move, their knowledge of the environment and navigation capacity, their motion capacity and the external factors related to landscape heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W4290702952,"Plasmepsin V (PM V) is a pepsin-like aspartic protease essential for growth of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Previous work has shown PM V to be an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protease that processes parasite proteins destined for export into the host cell. Depletion or inhibition of the enzyme is lethal during asexual replication within red blood cells as well as during the formation of sexual stage gametocytes. The structure of the Plasmodium vivax PM V has been characterized by X-ray crystallography, revealing a canonical pepsin fold punctuated by structural features uncommon to secretory aspartic proteases; however, the function of this unique structure is unclear. Here, we used parasite genetics to probe these structural features by attempting to rescue lethal PM V depletion with various mutant enzymes. We found an unusual nepenthesin 1-type insert in the PM V gene to be essential for parasite growth and PM V activity. Mutagenesis of the nepenthesin insert suggests that both its amino acid sequence and one of the two disulfide bonds that undergird its structure are required for the insert's role in PM V function. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations paired with Markov state modeling suggest that mutations to the nepenthesin insert may allosterically affect PM V catalysis through multiple mechanisms. Taken together, these data provide further insights into the structure of the P. falciparum PM V protease."

Methods 47,145 patients with prescription of antidiabetic agents &gt;6 months in the outpatient visits (2003–2018) were linked to Taiwan’s National Death Registry to identify all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Poisson assumption was used to estimate the mortality rates, and the Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to evaluate the relative hazards of respective mortality in relation to mean HbA1c in different statuses of anemia and CKD stages. Results All-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates were the lowest in non-anemic stages 1–2 CKD patients, and the highest in anemic stages 3–5 CKD patients. In stages 1–2 CKD, excessive HRs observed in those with mean HbA1c &lt;6.0% (Hazard Ratio [HR]) 1.58; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.18–2.12) became inconsequential after adjustment of medications and laboratory results (HR: 1.26; 95% CI 0.89–1.79). The similar patterns were observed in anemic stages 1–2 CKD, anemic or non-anemic stages 3–5 CKD. Low HbA1c was not related to cardiovascular mortality in any anemia status or CKD staging. Conclusions Higher risks associated with low mean HbA1c and all-cause mortality were attenuated by adjustment of medications and comorbidities. It is imperative for the diabetologists to consider confounding effects of underlying illness before concluding low HbA1c associated higher mortality."

We also used the aggregated data on passenger volume by transportation mode for the 47 prefectures, as well as those in the private railway, bus, ship, and aviation categories. The starting location (prefecture) was defined as Kanagawa and as Tokyo for the 1st and the 2nd waves, respectively. The accuracy of the spread models was evaluated using the correlation between time of arrival and effective distance, calculated according to the different starting locations.The number of cases in the analysis was 16,226 and 50,539 in the 1st and 2nd epidemic waves, respectively. The relationship between arrival time and geographical distance shows that the coefficient of determination was R2 = 0.0523 if geographical distance Dgeo and time of arrival Ta set to zero at Kanagawa and was R2 = 0.0109 if Dgeo and Ta set to zero at Tokyo. The relationship between arrival time and effective distance shows that the coefficient of determination was R2 = 0.3227 if effective distance Deff and Ta set to zero at Kanagawa and was R2 = 0.415 if Deff and time of arrival Ta set to zero at Tokyo. In other words, the effective distance taking into account the mobility network shows the spatiotemporal characteristics of the spread of infection better than geographical distance. The correlation of arrival time to effective distance showed the possibility of spreading from multiple areas in the 1st epidemic wave. On the other hand, the correlation of arrival time to effective distance showed the possibility of spreading from a specific area in the 2nd epidemic wave.The spread of COVID-19 in Japan was affected by the mobility network and the 2nd epidemic wave is more affected than those of the 1st epidemic. The effective distance approach has the impact to estimate the domestic spreading COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4291020789,"Introduction Genomic research and neurobiobanking are expanding globally. Empirical evidence on the level of awareness and willingness to donate/share biological samples towards the expansion of neurobiobanking in sub-Saharan Africa is lacking. Aims To ascertain the awareness, perspectives and predictors regarding biological sample donation, sharing and informed consent preferences among community members in Ghana and Nigeria. Methods A questionnaire cross-sectional survey was conducted among randomly selected community members from seven communities in Ghana and Nigeria. Results Of the 1015 respondents with mean age 39.3 years (SD 19.5), about a third had heard of blood donation (37.2%, M: 42.4%, F: 32.0%, p = 0.001) and a quarter were aware of blood sample storage for research (24.5%; M: 29.7%, F: 19.4%, p = 0.151). Two out of ten were willing to donate brain after death (18.8%, M: 22.6%, F: 15.0%, p&lt;0.001). Main reasons for unwillingness to donate brain were; to go back to God complete (46.6%) and lack of knowledge related to brain donation (32.7%). Only a third of the participants were aware of informed consent (31.7%; M: 35.9%, F: 27.5%, p&lt;0.001). Predictors of positive attitude towards biobanking and informed consent were being married, tertiary level education, student status, and belonging to select ethnic groups. Conclusion There is a greater need for research attention in the area of brain banking and informed consent. Improved context-sensitive public education on neurobiobanking and informed consent, in line with the sociocultural diversities, is recommended within the African sub region."

The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a model system for anthelmintic drug discovery, has a serotonin (5-HT)-gated chloride channel, MOD-1, which belongs to the Cys-loop receptor family and modulates locomotory and behavioral functions. Since MOD-1 is unique to nematodes, it is emerging as an attractive anthelmintic drug target, but details of MOD-1 function are unclear. Here, we revealed novel aspects of MOD-1 function from the molecular level to the organism level and identified compounds targeting this receptor, which may provide new directions for anthelmintic drug discovery. We used whole-cell current recordings from heterologously expressed MOD-1 to show that tryptamine (Tryp), a weak partial agonist of vertebrate serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptors, efficaciously activates MOD-1. A screen for modulators revealed that GABAergic ligands piperazine (PZE) and muscimol reduce 5-HT-elicited currents, thus identifying novel MOD-1 allosteric inhibitors. Next, we performed locomotor activity assays, and we found 5-HT and Tryp rapidly decrease worm motility, which is reversible only at low 5-HT concentrations. Mutants lacking MOD-1 are partially resistant to both drugs, demonstrating its role in locomotion. Acting as an antagonist of MOD-1, we showed PZE reduces the locomotor effects of exogenous 5-HT. Therefore, Tryp- and PZE-derived compounds, acting at MOD-1 through different molecular mechanisms, emerge as promising anthelmintic agents. This study enhances our knowledge of the function and drug selectivity of Cys-loop receptors and postulates MOD-1 as a potential target for anthelmintic therapy.

Parasitic nematodes have a great negative impact on human health. A great proportion of the world’s population, particularly those of underdeveloped and developing countries, harbors infections with helminths, which constitute the most common worldwide neglected tropical diseases. Parasitic nematodes also infect various types of organisms, including insects, animals, and plants and are therefore highly deleterious to veterinary health and agriculture productivity. Chemotherapy is required for eliminating morbidity associated with human and animal helminthiasis as well as for reducing crop and animal production loss. However, the emergence of nematodes resistant to the limited available drugs has become a global concern for veterinary and human health. Thus, new drugs and/or novel drug targets are urgently needed.Nematodes are thread-like roundworms that can be parasitic or live in a wide range of environments including soil. The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans shares physiological and pharmacological features with parasitic nematodes, including neurotransmitter receptors, and it is sensitive to most anthelmintic drugs (1Angstadt J.D.

Parasitol. 2006; 36: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, by overcoming the disadvantages of working with parasites, C. elegans has been used as a valuable model for anthelmintic drug discovery (3Sepúlveda-Crespo D. Reguera R.M. Rojo-Vázquez F.

The evolution of pentameric ligand-gated ion-channels and the changing family of anthelmintic drug targets.Parasitology. 2015; 142: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). They belong to the family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that play key roles throughout the nervous system in vertebrates and invertebrates.In vertebrates, Cys-loop receptors can be cationic channels, which include nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and serotonin type 3 receptors (5-HT3), or anionic channels, which include GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) and glycine receptors. The repertoire in invertebrates is markedly broader and comprises also anionic channels activated by glutamate, acetylcholine (ACh), or serotonin (5-HT). The lack of these receptors in vertebrates make them attractive drug targets for antiparasitic therapies. Indeed, the glutamate-activated chloride channel (GluCl) is the target of the widely used anthelmintic drug ivermectin (IVM) (5Lynagh T. Lynch J.W. Ivermectin binding sites in human and invertebrate Cys-loop receptors.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2012; 33: 432-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, nematode resistance because of its extended and massive use has become a problem for animal and human health.C. elegans possess a wide variety of serotonin receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors (SER-1, SER-4, SER-5, and SER-7) and a Cys-loop receptor named MOD-1, which is a chloride ion channel that mediates rapid hyperpolarizing responses in neurons and muscle (6Hamdan F.F.

A serotonin-gated cation channel, LGC-50, has been recently identified but does not show overlap in neuronal expression with MOD-1, suggesting they have distinct and separate roles in serotonergic signaling (12Morud J. Hardege I. Liu H. Wu T. Choi M.K. Basu S. et al.Deorphanization of novel biogenic amine-gated ion channels identifies a new serotonin receptor for learning.Curr. Biol. 2021; 31: 4282-4292.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).While MOD-1 and 5-HT3 share the ability to respond to 5-HT, they differ in their function in that 5-HT3 is a nonselective cation channel, whereas MOD-1 is a chloride channel not found in vertebrates (13Dent J.A. Evidence for a diverse cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel superfamily in early bilateria.J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 62: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As an anionic Cys-loop receptor, MOD-1 shows about 30% identity with vertebrate GABA and glycine receptors.MOD-1 expresses in C. elegans neurons and muscles that control behaviors, such as locomotion, egg laying, feeding, pharyngeal pumping, decision making, and aversive learning (14Churgin M.A. McCloskey R.J.

It is also present in vertebrate parasitic nematodes, and it has been shown that Haemonchus contortus MOD-1 shows 80% identity with C. elegans MOD-1 (17Beech R.N. Callanan M.K. Rao V.T.S. Dawe G.B. Forrester S.G. Characterization of cys-loop receptor genes involved in inhibitory amine neurotransmission in parasitic and free living nematodes.Parasitol. Int. 2013; 62: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A search of transcriptome data for the filarial nematode parasite Loa loa, Brugia malayi, and Wucheria bancrofti revealed predicted coding sequences for orthologs of mod-1 gene (17Beech R.N.

Gustafson M.A. Pepper J.S. Horvitz H.R. Koelle M.R.

Heterologous expression in remodeled C. elegans: a platform for monoaminergic agonist identification and anthelmintic screening.PLOS Pathog. 2015; 11e1004794Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The 5-HT-induced paralysis differs from the classical spastic or flaccid paralysis and has been suggested to result mainly from the inability of worms to effectively integrate conflicting sensory inputs to initiate and sustain forward/backward locomotion (20Law W. Wuescher L.M. Ortega A. Hapiak V.M. Komuniecki P.R. Komuniecki R. Heterologous expression in remodeled C. elegans: a platform for monoaminergic agonist identification and anthelmintic screening.PLOS Pathog. 2015; 11e1004794Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). MOD-1 has been proposed as a potential drug target to control plant parasitic nematodes. In the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida, MOD-1 participates in a serotonin signaling pathway that is essential for activation of the stylet that is used to access the host root (18Crisford A. Calahorro F. Ludlow E. Marvin J.M.C. Hibbard J.K. Lilley C.J. et al.Identification and characterisation of serotonin signalling in the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida reveals new targets for crop protection.PLoS Pathog. 2020; 16e1008884Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).Thus, ligands acting at MOD-1 can be attractive anthelmintic drugs expected to show secure toxicological profiles due to high selectivity for nematodes. However, little is known about MOD-1 molecular pharmacology and function.Considering that MOD-1 can become an important novel anthelmintic target for parasites of humans, animals, and crops, we here revealed from the molecular level to the organism level novel aspects of its function and drug selectivity, and we identified MOD-1 ligands that may provide attractive scaffolds for anthelmintic discovery.ResultsActivation and desensitization properties of MOD-1To decipher activation and desensitization properties of MOD-1, we expressed it in BOSC-23 cells and measured macroscopic currents elicited by rapid application of 5-HT at -50 mV holding potential (Fig. 1A). We constructed concentration–response curves by measuring at different agonist concentrations the peak currents, which were normalized to that elicited by a saturating 5-HT concentration (100 μM) in the same cell (Fig. 1, A and B). The resulting EC50 (half maximal effective concentration) for 5-HT was 0.96 ± 0.40 μM, which is in the same order as that of human and mouse 5-HT3A receptors (21Corradi J. Bouzat C. Unraveling mechanisms underlying partial agonism in 5-HT3A receptors.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 16865-16876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).At a saturating 5-HT concentration (100 μM), the rise time, measured by t10-90% was 12.4 ± 4.1 ms (n = 10), which is similar to that of mouse and human 5-HT3A receptors (22Rodriguez Araujo N. Fabiani C. Mazzarini Dimarco A. Bouzat C. Corradi J. Orthosteric and allosteric activation of human 5-HT3A receptors.Biophys. J. 2020; 119: 1670-1682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Decays were fitted by two exponential components, with time constants of 132 ± 1 ms (area 0.70 ± 0.09) and 1067 ± 290 ms (area 0.30 ± 0.15) (n = 5).We measured the time course of recovery from desensitization using a twin pulse procedure (Fig. 1C). After a 3.5 s 5-HT pulse (100 μM) that allowed full desensitization, a pulse of free-agonist extracellular solution (ECS) was applied for variable durations in intervals of 200 ms, and then, a second pulse of agonist was applied. Fractional recovery was determined as the ratio between the peak current elicited by the second pulse of 5-HT respect to the first one for each cell. The plot of the percentage of recovery against the duration of the agonist-free interpulse was fitted by a single exponential with a time constant for recovery of 1.10 ± 0.007 s (n = 4), which is slightly faster than that of mouse 5-HT3A receptors (⁓4 s, (23Corradi J. Gumilar F. Bouzat C. Single-channel kinetic analysis for activation and desensitization of homomeric 5-HT3A receptors.Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 1335-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1C).To further characterize MOD-1 activation, we constructed current–voltage relationships (I/V) by measuring the peak current elicited by 1 μM 5-HT as a function of the holding potential (Fig. 1D). The reversal potential determined from the linear fit was −0.05 mV, which was similar to the theoretical value of the equilibrium potential for chloride under the present conditions (−3.4 mV). The magnitude of MOD-1 currents increased linearly with the voltage at both positive and negative holding potentials, indicating an ohmic behavior and little rectification.Searching for activators of MOD-1We first explored if agonists of vertebrate 5-HT3 receptors activate MOD-1. Tryptamine (Tryp) is a low-efficacy orthosteric agonist of mouse and human 5-HT3A receptors (21Corradi J. Bouzat C. Unraveling mechanisms underlying partial agonism in 5-HT3A receptors.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 16865-16876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 22Rodriguez Araujo N. Fabiani C. Mazzarini Dimarco A. Bouzat C. Corradi J. Orthosteric and allosteric activation of human 5-HT3A receptors.Biophys. J. 2020; 119: 1670-1682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The concentration–response curve for Tryp revealed an EC50 value of 47 ± 11 μM and an efficacy (α) ⁓80% (Figs. 1B and 2). This result indicates that Tryp is markedly more efficacious for MOD-1 than for human (EC50 = 190 μM and α = 27%) and mouse (EC50 = 40 μM and α = 22%) 5-HT3A receptors (21Corradi J. Bouzat C.

We also evaluated the action of 2-Me-5HT (2-metyl-5-hydroxytryptamine), which elicits partial responses in mouse 5-HT3A receptors (EC50 = 5.2 μM and α = 60%; (21Corradi J. Bouzat C. Unraveling mechanisms underlying partial agonism in 5-HT3A receptors.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 16865-16876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). Application of 50 μM 2-Me-5HT (n = 3) did not show detectable responses. Increasing the concentration to 100 μM (n = 3), 250 μM (n = 6), and 500 μM (n = 6) resulted in very small responses, indicating that 2-Me-5HT has an extremely low ability to activate MOD-1 (Fig. 2). Thus, although MOD-1 and 5-HT3A show similar sensitivity for 5-HT, they respond differently to other orthosteric 5-HT3 agonists.Figure 2Screening for MOD-1 activators.

We used concentrations that have been applied for activation of their canonical target receptors. For 10 μM IVM (n = 5), 100 μM LEV (n = 4), 1 mM PZE (n = 5), 500 and 1000 μM betaine (n = 6 and n = 9) responses were negligible, indicating that these drugs do not activate MOD-1 (Fig. 2). In the case of IVM, we also verified that MOD-1 currents were not elicited if the drug was applied during 2 min (10 μM IVM; n = 5) as it has been shown that it produces slow activation of the GluCl receptor (34Degani-Katzav N.

A pulse of ECS containing 1 μM 5-HT (control current) was applied to the cell, the cell was then exposed during 30 to 120 s to ECS containing the drug under study, and, finally, a second pulse of ECS containing 1 μM 5-HT was applied (treated current). The changes in net charge and amplitude of the treated current with respect to the control one were averaged among different cells (Fig. 3A).Figure 3Modulation of MOD-1 currents by preincubation with different compounds. A, illustrative example of the protocol used to determine the effects of drug preincubation on 5-HT-elicited currents (preincubation protocol). Holding potential: -50 mV. 3.5 s-pulse of 1 μM 5-HT was applied before and after preincubation during 30 s with ECS (control) or the drug under study. Currents were recorded after 30 s wash with ECS to confirm recovery. This protocol was repeated three times in each cell.

Interestingly, pre-exposure of the cell to 1 mM PZE led to a profound decrease of the peak current (69.2 ± 6%, p < 0.001) and of the net charge (66.3 ± 9%, p < 0.001, n = 12) (Fig. 3B).To further characterize the action of PZE as a new inhibitor of MOD-1, we constructed concentration–response curves to determine the IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) for currents activated by 1 μM 5-HT and preincubated for 30 s with PZE (Fig. 3C). We found that PZE inhibits MOD-1 currents with an IC50 of 113 ± 29 μM.We determined if PZE also affects MOD-1 currents when applied together with 5-HT (co-application protocol). In each cell, we applied three pulses of 1 μM 5-HT-containing ECS and then three pulses of ECS containing 1 μM 5-HT and 1 mM PZE. PZE produced neither statistically significant changes in the peak currents (0.91 ± 0.09, p = 0.617) nor in the net charge (0.93 ± 0.19, p = 0.669, n = 5). Thus, in contrast to the important effects observed with preincubation, co-application of PZE with 5-HT does not inhibit MOD-1 currents.Since PZE is a GABAergic ligand and MOD-1 shows ∼28% identity with Cel-UNC-49 (γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor [GABAA]) receptors, we also tested, by using the preincubation protocol, the effects of muscimol—a psychoactive isoxazole from Amanita muscaria and related mushrooms—and isoguvacine, which are selective GABAA agonists (35Johnston G.A.R. Muscimol as an ionotropic GABA receptor agonist.Neurochem. Res. 2014; 39: 1942-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We found that both drugs were not able to activate MOD-1 but produced inhibition of MOD-1 currents elicited by 5-HT. At 1 mM, isoguvacine reduced the peak currents 23 ± 14% (n = 10) and muscimol, 85 ± 6% (n = 5). Isoguvacine appeared to be a very weak antagonist since the reduction of the peak current remained at about 30% at concentrations higher than 0.6 mM.To further characterize the action of muscimol as a new inhibitor of MOD-1, we constructed concentration–response curves to determine the IC50 value for currents activated by 1 μM 5-HT and preincubated for 120 s with muscimol (Fig. 3C). We found that muscimol inhibits MOD-1 currents with an IC50 of 249 ± 160 μM, indicating lower potency than PZE.The inhibition of 5-HT currents by the GABAergic ligands could be due to either competitive or noncompetitive antagonism. The fact that PZE exerted greater reduction of currents if it was preincubated and not co-applied with 5-HT suggests that the inhibition is not competitive, thus revealing a new drug target for this classical antiparasitic agent. To further confirm the type of antagonism, we performed experiments in which the concentration of PZE during preincubation remained constant, but the 5-HT concentration was increased 10 and 100 times. The rationale for this experiment was that if PZE were competing with 5-HT, the increase in 5-HT concentration would reduce its effect. Figure 3D sh"
https://openalex.org/W4291008710,"Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is the task of identifying the semantic correlation between two sentences of the same or different languages. STS is an important task in natural language processing because it has many applications in different domains such as information retrieval, machine translation, plagiarism detection, document categorization, semantic search, and conversational systems. The availability of STS training and evaluation data resources for some languages such as English has led to good performance systems that achieve above 80% correlation with human judgment. Unfortunately, such required STS data resources are not available for many languages like Arabic. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes three different approaches to generate effective STS Arabic models. The first one is based on evaluating the use of automatic machine translation for English STS data to Arabic to be used in fine-tuning. The second approach is based on the interleaving of Arabic models with English data resources. The third approach is based on fine-tuning the knowledge distillation-based models to boost their performance in Arabic using a proposed translated dataset. With very limited resources consisting of just a few hundred Arabic STS sentence pairs, we managed to achieve a score of 81% correlation, evaluated using the standard STS 2017 Arabic evaluation set. Also, we managed to extend the Arabic models to process two local dialects, Egyptian (EG) and Saudi Arabian (SA), with a correlation score of 77.5% for EG dialect and 76% for the SA dialect evaluated using dialectal conversion from the same standard STS 2017 Arabic set."
https://openalex.org/W4290703601,"Synthetic lethal targeting of homologous recombination (HR)-deficient ovarian cancers (OvCas) with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) has attracted considerable attention. Olaparib was the first PARPi approved by the Food and Drug Administration, offering significant clinical benefits in BRCA1/2-deficient OvCas. However, only approximately 20% of OvCa patients harbor BRCA1/2 mutations. Given the shared roles that BRCA1/2 have with other HR regulators, alterations in HR genes may also contribute to ""BRCAness profiles"" in OvCas. RAD54B has been considered a key player in HR repair, although its roles and therapeutic potential in cancers need further investigation. Here, we identified 22 frequently mutated HR genes by whole-exome sequencing of OvCa tissues from 82 patients. To our surprise, 7.3% of patients were found to harbor mutations of RAD54B, the third-highest mutated gene among patients. We determined that RAD54B-mutated tumor tissues harbored more DNA double-strand breaks than normal tissues. Additionally, we found that RAD54B knockdown inhibited HR repair, enhanced sensitivities of OvCa cells with increased DNA double-strand breaks to olaparib, and induced apoptosis. Enhanced inhibitory effects of olaparib on the growth of ES2 xenograft tumors were further demonstrated by RAD54B knockdown. Finally, we show that restoration with wildtype RAD54B rather than RAD54BN593S and RAD54BH219Y, identified in patients, abolished the effects of RAD54B knockdown, indicating these RAD54B mutants probably malfunctioned in HR repair. Our investigations may offer insight into the contributions of RAD54B mutations to synthetic lethality with olaparib treatment in OvCas, enrich the gene list for ""HR deficiency scoring,"" and expand the applications of PARPis."

https://openalex.org/W4290960686,"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common condition in general practice. Data about quality and physician-level variation of CKD care provided by general practitioners is scarce. In this study, we evaluated determinants and variation of achievement of 14 quality indicators for CKD care using electronic medical records data from Swiss general practice during 2013–2019. Methods We defined two patient cohorts from 483 general practitioners, one to address renal function assessment in patients with predisposing conditions ( n = 47,201, median age 68 years, 48.7% female) and one to address care of patients with laboratory-confirmed CKD ( n = 14,654, median age 80 years, 57.5% female). We investigated quality indicator achievement with mixed-effect logistic regression and expressed physician-level variation as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and range odds ratios (rORs). Results We observed the highest quality indicator achievement rate for withholding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescription in patients with CKD staged G2–3b within 12 months of follow-up (82.6%), the lowest for albuminuria assessment within 18 months of follow-up (18.1%). Highest physician-level variation was found for renal function assessment during 18 months of follow-up in patients with predisposing conditions (diabetes: ICC 0.31, rOR 26.5; cardiovascular disease: ICC 0.28, rOR 17.4; hypertension: ICC 0.24, rOR 17.2). Conclusion This study suggests potentially unwarranted variation in general practice concerning RF assessment in patients affected by conditions predisposing for CKD. We further identified potential gaps in quality of CKD monitoring as well as lower quality of CKD care for female patients and patients not affected by comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W4290972984,"Objective This study aims to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the add-on exenatide to conventional pharmacotherapy in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) when considering the coexistence of diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods We used the Keelung and Community-based Integrated Screening databases to understand the medical utilisation in the Hoehn and Yahr stages of patients with PD. A Markov model with 1-year cycle length and 50-year time horizon was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of add-on exenatide to conventional pharmacotherapy compared to conventional pharmacotherapy alone. All costs were adjusted to the value of the new Taiwanese dollar (NT$) as of the year 2020. One-way sensitivity and probability analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. Results From a societal perspective, the add-on exenatide brought an average of 0.39 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and a cost increment of NT$104,744 per person in a 50-year horizon compared to conventional pharmacotherapy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was NT$268,333 per QALY gained. As the ICER was less than the gross domestic product per capita (NT$839,558), the add-on exenatide was considered to be very cost-effective in the two models, according to the World Health Organization recommendation. Add-on exenatide had a 96.9% probability of being cost-effective in patients with PD, and a 100% probability of being cost-effective in patients with PD and DM. Conclusion Add-on exenatide is cost-effective in PD combined with DM. Considering that DM may be a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, exenatide provides both clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness when considering both PD and DM."
https://openalex.org/W4291008806,"Feature extraction of electrical load plays a vital role in providing a reliable basis and guidance for power companies. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering algorithm named the Density-based Matrix Transformation (DBMT) Clustering method to extract features (peaks, valleys and trends) of electrical load curves. The main objective of the algorithm is to reorder the data items until the data items belonging to the same cluster are organized together; that is, the adjacent matrix is rearranged to the type of block diagonal. This method adaptively determines the number of clusters and filters out noise without input global parameters. Moreover, for the specific characteristics of raw electrical load data, we propose a variant of Dynamic Time Warp (DTW) distance, dsDTW, which aligns the peaks, valleys and trends of load curves meanwhile dealing with missing values in different situations. After feeding the dsDTW adjacent matrix to DBMT, the results indicate that our proposal can accurately extract the feature of the load curves compared to different clustering methods."

Specifically, international policy comparison news, or news that compares the policies of two or more countries on the same issue, is a potentially important but underutilized and understudied form of news content. We use an experiment to test effects of exposure to news comparing the COVID-19 pandemic policies of the U.S. versus South Korea, and find that this increases knowledge of policy differences between the two countries, support for adopting similar policies in the U.S., presidential blame for the severity of the pandemic in the U.S., and trust in health experts. On most outcomes, these effects did not vary across political party lines, a particularly encouraging result given the polarized nature of policy debates on this issue."
