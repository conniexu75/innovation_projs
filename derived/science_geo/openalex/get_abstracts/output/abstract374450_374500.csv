Borucki et al. (p. 977 , published online 7 January) summarize the planetary findings derived from the first six weeks of observations with the Kepler mission whose objective is to search for and determine the frequency of Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of other stars. The results include the detection of five new exoplanets, which confirm the existence of planets with densities substantially lower than those predicted for gas giant planets."
https://openalex.org/W1979816280,"A role for B-cell-receptor (BCR) signalling in lymphomagenesis has been inferred by studying immunoglobulin genes in human lymphomas and by engineering mouse models, but genetic and functional evidence for its oncogenic role in human lymphomas is needed. Here we describe a form of 'chronic active' BCR signalling that is required for cell survival in the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The signalling adaptor CARD11 is required for constitutive NF-kappaB pathway activity and survival in ABC DLBCL. Roughly 10% of ABC DLBCLs have mutant CARD11 isoforms that activate NF-kappaB, but the mechanism that engages wild-type CARD11 in other ABC DLBCLs was unknown. An RNA interference genetic screen revealed that a BCR signalling component, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, is essential for the survival of ABC DLBCLs with wild-type CARD11. In addition, knockdown of proximal BCR subunits (IgM, Ig-kappa, CD79A and CD79B) killed ABC DLBCLs with wild-type CARD11 but not other lymphomas. The BCRs in these ABC DLBCLs formed prominent clusters in the plasma membrane with low diffusion, similarly to BCRs in antigen-stimulated normal B cells. Somatic mutations affecting the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) signalling modules of CD79B and CD79A were detected frequently in ABC DLBCL biopsy samples but rarely in other DLBCLs and never in Burkitt's lymphoma or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. In 18% of ABC DLBCLs, one functionally critical residue of CD79B, the first ITAM tyrosine, was mutated. These mutations increased surface BCR expression and attenuated Lyn kinase, a feedback inhibitor of BCR signalling. These findings establish chronic active BCR signalling as a new pathogenetic mechanism in ABC DLBCL, suggesting several therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2079212177,"A large survey for somatic mutations in clear cell renal cell carcinomas, the most common form of adult kidney cancer, shows that in addition to the known inactivating mutations in the VHL gene, recurrent mutations occur in the NF2 gene, which encodes a tumour suppressor protein and in genes encoding the chromatin modifying enzymes SETD2, JARID1C and UTX. Clear cell renal carcinoma, the most common form of adult kidney cancer, is often characterized by the presence of inactivating mutations in the VHL gene. A large survey for somatic mutations now identifies inactivating mutations in two genes encoding enzymes involved in histone modification, highlighting the role of mutations in components of the chromatin modification machinery in human cancer. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common form of adult kidney cancer, characterized by the presence of inactivating mutations in the VHL gene in most cases1,2, and by infrequent somatic mutations in known cancer genes. To determine further the genetics of ccRCC, we have sequenced 101 cases through 3,544 protein-coding genes. Here we report the identification of inactivating mutations in two genes encoding enzymes involved in histone modification—SETD2, a histone H3 lysine 36 methyltransferase, and JARID1C (also known as KDM5C), a histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase—as well as mutations in the histone H3 lysine 27 demethylase, UTX (KMD6A), that we recently reported3. The results highlight the role of mutations in components of the chromatin modification machinery in human cancer. Furthermore, NF2 mutations were found in non-VHL mutated ccRCC, and several other probable cancer genes were identified. These results indicate that substantial genetic heterogeneity exists in a cancer type dominated by mutations in a single gene, and that systematic screens will be key to fully determining the somatic genetic architecture of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2043358402,"The ability to silence the activity of genetically specified neurons in a temporally precise fashion would provide the opportunity to investigate the causal role of specific cell classes in neural computations, behaviours and pathologies. Here we show that members of the class of light-driven outward proton pumps can mediate powerful, safe, multiple-colour silencing of neural activity. The gene archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) from Halorubrum sodomense enables near-100% silencing of neurons in the awake brain when virally expressed in the mouse cortex and illuminated with yellow light. Arch mediates currents of several hundred picoamps at low light powers, and supports neural silencing currents approaching 900 pA at light powers easily achievable in vivo. Furthermore, Arch spontaneously recovers from light-dependent inactivation, unlike light-driven chloride pumps that enter long-lasting inactive states in response to light. These properties of Arch are appropriate to mediate the optical silencing of significant brain volumes over behaviourally relevant timescales. Arch function in neurons is well tolerated because pH excursions created by Arch illumination are minimized by self-limiting mechanisms to levels comparable to those mediated by channelrhodopsins or natural spike firing. To highlight how proton pump ecological and genomic diversity may support new innovation, we show that the blue-green light-drivable proton pump from the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans (Mac) can, when expressed in neurons, enable neural silencing by blue light, thus enabling alongside other developed reagents the potential for independent silencing of two neural populations by blue versus red light. Light-driven proton pumps thus represent a high-performance and extremely versatile class of 'optogenetic' voltage and ion modulator, which will broadly enable new neuroscientific, biological, neurological and psychiatric investigations."
https://openalex.org/W1975264848,"The Dirac equation, proposed by Paul Dirac in 1928 to describe the behaviour of relativistic quantum particles, merges quantum mechanics with special relativity. A number of peculiar effects emerge from the equation, including a rapid quivering motion or 'Zitterbewegung', well established in theory but difficult to observe in real particles. Christian Roos and colleagues have developed a proof-of-principle quantum simulation of the Dirac equation using a single trapped ion set to behave as a free relativistic quantum particle. The high level of control of trapped-ion experimental parameters in this system makes it possible to simulate and study Zitterbewegung and other textbook examples of relativistic quantum physics. The Dirac equation successfully merges quantum mechanics with special relativity. It predicts some peculiar effects such as 'Zitterbewegung', an unexpected quivering motion of a free relativistic quantum particle. This and other predicted phenomena are key fundamental examples for understanding relativistic quantum effects, but are difficult to observe in real particles. Here, using a single trapped ion set to behave as a free relativistic quantum particle, a quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Dirac equation is demonstrated. The Dirac equation1 successfully merges quantum mechanics with special relativity. It provides a natural description of the electron spin, predicts the existence of antimatter2 and is able to reproduce accurately the spectrum of the hydrogen atom. The realm of the Dirac equation—relativistic quantum mechanics—is considered to be the natural transition to quantum field theory. However, the Dirac equation also predicts some peculiar effects, such as Klein’s paradox3 and ‘Zitterbewegung’, an unexpected quivering motion of a free relativistic quantum particle4. These and other predicted phenomena are key fundamental examples for understanding relativistic quantum effects, but are difficult to observe in real particles. In recent years, there has been increased interest in simulations of relativistic quantum effects using different physical set-ups5,6,7,8,9,10,11, in which parameter tunability allows access to different physical regimes. Here we perform a proof-of-principle quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Dirac equation using a single trapped ion7 set to behave as a free relativistic quantum particle. We measure the particle position as a function of time and study Zitterbewegung for different initial superpositions of positive- and negative-energy spinor states, as well as the crossover from relativistic to non-relativistic dynamics. The high level of control of trapped-ion experimental parameters makes it possible to simulate textbook examples of relativistic quantum physics."
https://openalex.org/W1971645224,"When embryonic stem cells (ESCs) differentiate, they must both silence the ESC self-renewal program and activate new tissue-specific programs. In the absence of DGCR8 (Dgcr8(-/-)), a protein required for microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, mouse ESCs are unable to silence self-renewal. Here we show that the introduction of let-7 miRNAs-a family of miRNAs highly expressed in somatic cells-can suppress self-renewal in Dgcr8(-/-) but not wild-type ESCs. Introduction of ESC cell cycle regulating (ESCC) miRNAs into the Dgcr8(-/-) ESCs blocks the capacity of let-7 to suppress self-renewal. Profiling and bioinformatic analyses show that let-7 inhibits whereas ESCC miRNAs indirectly activate numerous self-renewal genes. Furthermore, inhibition of the let-7 family promotes de-differentiation of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells. Together, these findings show how the ESCC and let-7 miRNAs act through common pathways to alternatively stabilize the self-renewing versus differentiated cell fates."

Current methods to detect the signal of selection often results in the identification of a broad genomic region containing many candidate regions that vary among individuals. By combining existing statistical methods, Grossman et al.

Several candidate regions under selection in human populations were identified."
https://openalex.org/W2006998486,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate the majority of cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters, and these membrane proteins are the largest group of therapeutic targets for a broad range of diseases. It is very difficult to obtain high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of GPCRs; little is known about the functional role(s) of the extracellular surface in receptor activation or about the conformational coupling of the extracellular surface to the native ligand-binding pocket. In this study, Bokoch et al. used NMR spectroscopy to investigate ligand-specific conformational changes around a salt bridge linking extracellular loops 2 and 3 of the β2 adrenergic receptor. They found that drugs that bind within the transmembrane core (and exhibit different efficacies towards G-protein activation) stabilize distinct conformations of the extracellular surface. New therapeutic agents that target this diverse surface could function as allosteric modulators with high subtype selectivity. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate the majority of cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters and are the largest group of therapeutic targets for a range of diseases. The extracellular surface (ECS) of GPCRs is diverse and therefore an ideal target for the discovery of subtype-selective drugs. Here, NMR spectroscopy is used to investigate ligand-specific conformational changes around a central structural feature in the ECS of a GPCR. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven-transmembrane proteins that mediate most cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters. They are the largest group of therapeutic targets for a broad spectrum of diseases. Recent crystal structures of GPCRs1,2,3,4,5 have revealed structural conservation extending from the orthosteric ligand-binding site in the transmembrane core to the cytoplasmic G-protein-coupling domains. In contrast, the extracellular surface (ECS) of GPCRs is remarkably diverse and is therefore an ideal target for the discovery of subtype-selective drugs. However, little is known about the functional role of the ECS in receptor activation, or about conformational coupling of this surface to the native ligand-binding pocket. Here we use NMR spectroscopy to investigate ligand-specific conformational changes around a central structural feature in the ECS of the β2 adrenergic receptor: a salt bridge linking extracellular loops 2 and 3. Small-molecule drugs that bind within the transmembrane core and exhibit different efficacies towards G-protein activation (agonist, neutral antagonist and inverse agonist) also stabilize distinct conformations of the ECS. We thereby demonstrate conformational coupling between the ECS and the orthosteric binding site, showing that drugs targeting this diverse surface could function as allosteric modulators with high subtype selectivity. Moreover, these studies provide a new insight into the dynamic behaviour of GPCRs not addressable by static, inactive-state crystal structures."
https://openalex.org/W2074897380,"Retroviruses are the only group of viruses known to have left a fossil record, in the form of endogenous proviruses, and approximately 8% of the human genome is made up of these elements. Although many other viruses, including non-retroviral RNA viruses, are known to generate DNA forms of their own genomes during replication, none has been found as DNA in the germline of animals. Bornaviruses, a genus of non-segmented, negative-sense RNA virus, are unique among RNA viruses in that they establish persistent infection in the cell nucleus. Here we show that elements homologous to the nucleoprotein (N) gene of bornavirus exist in the genomes of several mammalian species, including humans, non-human primates, rodents and elephants. These sequences have been designated endogenous Borna-like N (EBLN) elements. Some of the primate EBLNs contain an intact open reading frame (ORF) and are expressed as mRNA. Phylogenetic analyses showed that EBLNs seem to have been generated by different insertional events in each specific animal family. Furthermore, the EBLN of a ground squirrel was formed by a recent integration event, whereas those in primates must have been formed more than 40 million years ago. We also show that the N mRNA of a current mammalian bornavirus, Borna disease virus (BDV), can form EBLN-like elements in the genomes of persistently infected cultured cells. Our results provide the first evidence for endogenization of non-retroviral virus-derived elements in mammalian genomes and give novel insights not only into generation of endogenous elements, but also into a role of bornavirus as a source of genetic novelty in its host."
https://openalex.org/W2074422222,"Type Ia supernovae are potentially invaluable as cosmological distance indicators, but if they are to provide a reliable measure of the expansion history of the Universe and nature of dark energy, more evidence that they are a largely homogeneous population will be required. A subclass of type Ia supernova, the 'sub-luminous 1991bg-like' objects, has proved problematic, as current models fail to predict their formation from the presumed supernova precursors, white dwarf stars. It had long been speculated that mergers of two white dwarfs should trigger such events, and now a new set of numerical simulations adds support to this idea. A merger of two equal-mass white dwarfs leads to a sub-luminous explosion if a single common-envelope phase is involved, and if the component stars are each about 0.9 solar masses in size. Existing models of type Ia supernovae generally explain their observed properties, with the exception of the sub-luminous 1991bg-like supernovae. It has long been suspected that the merger of two white dwarfs could give rise to a type Ia event, but simulations so far have failed to produce an explosion. Here, a simulation of the merger of two equal-mass white dwarfs is presented that leads to a sub-luminous explosion; it requires a single common-envelope phase and component masses of about 0.9 solar masses. Type Ia supernovae are thought to result from thermonuclear explosions of carbon–oxygen white dwarf stars1. Existing models2 generally explain the observed properties, with the exception of the sub-luminous 1991bg-like supernovae3. It has long been suspected that the merger of two white dwarfs could give rise to a type Ia event4,5, but hitherto simulations have failed to produce an explosion6,7. Here we report a simulation of the merger of two equal-mass white dwarfs that leads to a sub-luminous explosion, although at the expense of requiring a single common-envelope phase, and component masses of ∼0.9M⊙. The light curve is too broad, but the synthesized spectra, red colour and low expansion velocities are all close to what is observed for sub-luminous 1991bg-like events. Although the mass ratios can be slightly less than one and still produce a sub-luminous event, the masses have to be in the range 0.83M⊙ to 0.9M⊙."
https://openalex.org/W2095146606,"Eukaryotic DNA replication uses kinase regulatory pathways to facilitate coordination with other processes during cell division cycles and response to environmental cues. At least two cell cycle-regulated protein kinase systems, the S-phase-specific cyclin-dependent protein kinases (S-CDKs) and the Dbf4-Cdc7 kinase (DDK, Dbf4-dependent protein kinase) are essential activators for initiation of DNA replication. Although the essential mechanism of CDK activation of DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been established, exactly how DDK acts has been unclear. Here we show that the amino terminal serine/threonine-rich domain (NSD) of Mcm4 has both inhibitory and facilitating roles in DNA replication control and that the sole essential function of DDK is to relieve an inhibitory activity residing within the NSD. By combining an mcm4 mutant lacking the inhibitory activity with mutations that bypass the requirement for CDKs for initiation of DNA replication, we show that DNA synthesis can occur in G1 phase when CDKs and DDK are limited. However, DDK is still required for efficient S phase progression. In the absence of DDK, CDK phosphorylation at the distal part of the Mcm4 NSD becomes crucial. Moreover, DDK-null cells fail to activate the intra-S-phase checkpoint in the presence of hydroxyurea-induced DNA damage and are unable to survive this challenge. Our studies establish that the eukaryote-specific NSD of Mcm4 has evolved to integrate several protein kinase regulatory signals for progression through S phase."
https://openalex.org/W2070134425,"After fertilization in mammals, the maternal and paternal genomes undergo epigenetic reprogramming to prepare for the transition from germ cell to somatic cell transcription programs. One of the events involved in this process is the rapid demethylation of the paternal genome. To identify factors involved in this process, a live-cell imaging system was developed to monitor paternal DNA methylation state in zygotes. Elp3, a component of the elongator complex, is found to be important for paternal DNA demethylation. After fertilization in mammals, the maternal and paternal genomes undergo epigenetic reprogramming to prepare for the transition from germ cell to somatic cell transcription programs. One of the events that takes place is the demethylation of the paternal genome. To identify the factors involved in this process, a live cell imaging system is now used to monitor the paternal DNA methylation state in zygotes; Elp3, a component of the elongator complex, is found to have an important role. The life cycle of mammals begins when a sperm enters an egg. Immediately after fertilization, both the maternal and paternal genomes undergo dramatic reprogramming to prepare for the transition from germ cell to somatic cell transcription programs1. One of the molecular events that takes place during this transition is the demethylation of the paternal genome2,3. Despite extensive efforts, the factors responsible for paternal DNA demethylation have not been identified4. To search for such factors, we developed a live cell imaging system that allows us to monitor the paternal DNA methylation state in zygotes. Through short-interfering-RNA-mediated knockdown in mouse zygotes, we identified Elp3 (also called KAT9), a component of the elongator complex5, to be important for paternal DNA demethylation. We demonstrate that knockdown of Elp3 impairs paternal DNA demethylation as indicated by reporter binding, immunostaining and bisulphite sequencing. Similar results were also obtained when other elongator components, Elp1 and Elp4, were knocked down. Importantly, injection of messenger RNA encoding the Elp3 radical SAM domain mutant, but not the HAT domain mutant, into MII oocytes before fertilization also impaired paternal DNA demethylation, indicating that the SAM radical domain is involved in the demethylation process. Our study not only establishes a critical role for the elongator complex in zygotic paternal genome demethylation, but also indicates that the demethylation process may be mediated through a reaction that requires an intact radical SAM domain."
https://openalex.org/W1996635457,"Centrosome-Free Axonal Regeneration Neuronal axon growth is thought to depend on microtubules that are assembled at the centrosome, the classical microtubule organizing center (MTOC), which may even dictate axon growth. However, such a local trigger of neuronal polarization and focal microtubule nucleation in the cell body appears difficult to reconcile with the sophisticated microtubule arrays observed in neurons. Now, Stiess et al. (p. 704 , published online 7 January) provide evidence, through physical ablation of the centrosome in mammalian neurons, that axon growth is regulated by acentrosomal microtubule nucleation. The findings suggest that the centrosome loses its function as an MTOC during neuronal development, that axon growth depends on decentralized microtubule assembly, and that neuronal differentiation takes place in the absence of a functional centrosome."

However, the nature of the particles that produce the emission remains ambiguous. We report observations of SNR W44 with the Fermi Large Area Telescope at energies between 2 x 10(8) electron volts and 3 x10(11) electron volts. The detection of a source with a morphology corresponding to the SNR shell implies that the emission is produced by particles accelerated there. The gamma-ray spectrum is well modeled with emission from protons and nuclei. Its steepening above approximately 10(9) electron volts provides a probe with which to study how particle acceleration responds to environmental effects such as shock propagation in dense clouds and how accelerated particles are released into interstellar space."

Five of these miRNAs are enriched in RPE compared with 20 tissues throughout the body and are 10- to 20,000-fold more highly expressed (P<0.005). miR-204 and 211 are the most highly expressed in the RPE. In addition, expression of miR-204/211 is significantly lower in the NCI60 tumor cell line panel compared with that in 13 normal tissues, suggesting the progressive disruption of epithelial barriers and increased proliferation. We demonstrated that TGF-beta receptor 2 (TGF-betaR2) and SNAIL2 are direct targets of miR-204 and that a reduction in miR-204 expression leads to reduced expression of claudins 10, 16, and 19 (message/protein) consistent with our observation that anti-miR-204/211 decreased transepithelial resistance by 80% and reduced cell membrane voltage and conductance. The anti-miR-204-induced decrease in Kir7.1 protein levels suggests a signaling pathway that connects TGF-betaR2 and maintenance of potassium homeostasis. Overall, these data indicate a critical role for miR-204/211 in maintaining epithelial barrier function and cell physiology."

However apart from ANO1 and ANO2, it is currently not clear whether all anoctamins produce Ca2+-activated Cl− currents (7.Yang Y.D. Cho H. Koo J.Y. Tak M.H. Cho Y. Shim W.S. Park S.P. Lee J. Lee B.

Pflügers Arch. 2009; 458: 1023-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It may well be that different cell types express a pattern of anoctamins that supplies a specific cell type with Ca2+-activated Cl− conductance of a particular property. Anoctamin proteins appear to have quite homologous structures apart from ANO8, which has a largely extended p-loop (15.Kunzelmann K. Kongsuphol P. AlDehni F. Tian Y. Ousingsawat J. Warth R. Schreiber R. Cell Calcium. 2009; 46: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the present study we therefore analyzed expression of all ten members (ANO1- ANO10) in a broad range of murine tissues. We found predominant expression of ANO 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 in epithelial tissues, which were examined more closely by overexpression in FRT cells. Fluorescence quenching of halide-sensitive yellow fluorescence protein and patch clamping suggested that some but not all investigated anoctamins are able to produce Ca2+-dependent Cl− currents, albeit with variable regulation and functional properties. From 3 male (7 month) C57BL/6 mice, total RNA was isolated from different tissues using the RNeasy Mini- or Micro kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). RNA was reverse transcribed for 1 h at 37 °C using random primer and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega). Real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed in a plate reader Light Cycler 480 (Roche Applied Science) and by using a Sybrgreen I PCR Kit (Roche Applied Science). Each reaction contained 5 μl of Sybrgreen mastermix, 1 pm of each primer (supplemental Table S1) and 1 μl of cDNA. After 5 min at 94 °C for activation of Taq polymerase, cDNA was amplified by 15 s at 94 °C, 10 s at 62 °C, and 10 s at 72 °C, for 50 cycles. Pooled cDNA from all organs served as standard. To compare different runs, a calibrator was used. The amplification was followed by a melting curve analysis to control the PCR products. As negative controls, water instead of cDNA was run with every PCR experiment. To verify accuracy of the amplification, PCR products were further analyzed on ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gels. Data were analyzed with Light Cycler 480 software (Roche Applied Science). The target expressions were normalized using β-actin expression as reference. A mean value of target expression from three mice for each tissue was calculated. ANO1, ANO6, and ANO9 cDNA was amplified from total RNA of 16HBE-14o cells (bronchial epithelium; kindly provided by Prof. D. Gruenert, CPMRI, San Francisco, CA) by RT-PCR using the primer for ANO1: sense 5′-AAAAGCGGCCGCGGCCACGATGAGGGTC-3′, antisense 5′-AAATCTAGAAACAGGACGCCCCCGTGGTA-3′, for ANO6: sense 5′-TTAGCGGCCGCCATGAAAAAGATGAGCAGGAATG-3′, antisense 5′-TTTTTCTAGATTTTCTGATTTTGGCCGTAAATTG-3′ and for ANO9: sense 5′-AAAGATATCATGCAGGGCGAAGAGAGC-3′, antisense 5′-AAATCTAGATTCACGTCTGTGCTCCTGGC-3′. The cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 V5-His (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). 16HBE-14o cells express an ANO1 isoform containing the exons a, b, and c, according to Caputo et al. (9.Caputo A. Caci E. Ferrera L. Pedemonte N. Barsanti C. Sondo E. Pfeffer U. Ravazzolo R. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Science. 2008; 322: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). The His tag is located at the intracellular C-terminal end of the different anoctamins. Mouse ANO2 was purchased from ImaGenes GmbH (Berlin, Germany, Clone: IRAVp968H1167D). Human Ano5 cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR from total RNA of A549 cells (carcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells, kindly provided by Prof. M. D. Amaral, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisboa, Portugal) using the primers 5′-AAAAGGATCCGGCGAAGATGGGCGACCC-3′ and 5′-TTTTCTCGAGTTGAGTGTTGATTTAGCCAGCTG-3′ and subcloned into pcDNA3.1V5His. Human ANO7L and human ANO7S cDNA were kindly provided by I. Pastan (NCI, National Institutes of Health) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 V5-His. Human ANO8 (GenBankTM Accession No: BC037307) was purchased from imaGenes (Clone: IMAGp998FF0411661Q, Berlin, Germany) and subcloned without intron into pcDNA3.1 V5-His). Human ANO10 was purchased from OriGene (Rockville, MD, catalogue no SC113757) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1V5His. The EYFP-I152L plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. A. Verkman (UCSF, San Francisco). All cDNAs were verified by sequencing. Fisher rat thyroid (FRT) cells cultured in Invitrogen's DMEM/F-12+GlutaMAXTM-I medium, supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin (100,000 units/liter)/streptomycin (100 mg/liter). Total RNA was isolated, and RT-PCR was performed to identify endogenous expression of ANO proteins using primers against rat ANO1, 3, 4, 6, 7 (supplemental Table S2) and mouse primer for ANO2, 5, 8, 9, and 10. Plasmids were transfected into FRT cells using standard methods (Lipofectamine, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). All experiments were performed 48 h after the transfection. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.08% deoxycholic acid, 5 units/ml benzonase + protease inhibitor) and separated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore) for 90 min on ice at 200 mA. Membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS-Tween 20 and probed overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit polyclonal primary anti-His antibody (Cell Signaling, 2365) diluted 1:1000. A secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit was used at 1:5000 dilution (Acaris, R136HRP), and blots were visualized using chemiluminescence (Pierce). Transfected FRT cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed for 10 min with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde at room temperature. Cells were incubated for 5 min with 0.1% SDS in PBS. After washing, cells were permeabilized and blocked with 2% (w/v, PBS) bovine serum albumin and 0.04% (v/v, PBS) Triton X-100 and incubated for 1 h with primary antibody mouse anti-His tag (1:500, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) at 37 °C. Binding of the primary antibody was visualized by incubation with a secondary donkey anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with AlexaFluor® 488 (1:1.000, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained with Hoe33342 (0.1 μg/ml PBS, Aplichem, Darmstadt, Germany). β-Catenin was visualized using an Alexa 568-labeled secondary antibody. F-actin was labeled with phalloidin-conjugated AlexaFluor® 647 (1:40, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Cells were mounted on glass slides with fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) and examined with an ApoTome Axiovert 200 m fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Quenching of the intracellular fluorescence generated by the iodide-sensitive enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP-I152L) was used to measure anion conductance. YFP-I152L fluorescence was excited at 490 nm using a high speed polychromatic illumination system for microscopic fluorescence measurement (Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany) and the emitted light at 535 ± 25 nm was detected with a Coolsnap HQ CCD camera (Roper Scientific). Quenching of YFP-I152L fluorescence by I− influx was induced by replacing 20 mm extracellular Cl− by I−. Images were analyzed with Metafluor software (Universal Imaging). Cells were grown on coverslips and mounted in a thermostatically controlled imaging chamber maintained at 37 °C. Cells were continuously perfused at 4–5 ml/min with Ringer solution and exposed to I− concentration of 20 mm by replacing same amount of NaCl with equimolar NaI. Background fluorescence was subtracted, and autofluorescence was negligible. Changes in fluorescence induced by I− are expressed as initial rates of maximal fluorescence decrease (ΔRF/Δt). For quantitative analysis, cells with low or excessively high fluorescence were discarded. We observed that the slope for fluorescence quenching for any given condition was not dependent on the absolute YFP fluorescence. FTR cells were grown on coverslips, which were mounted in a perfused bath on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100, Zeiss) and kept at 37 °C. The bath was perfused continuously with Ringer solution at about 10 ml/min. Patch-clamp experiments were performed in the fast whole-cell configuration. Patch pipettes had an input resistance of 4–6 MΩ, when filled with ringer solution or an intracellular-like solution containing (mm) KCl 30, potassium gluconate 95, NaH2PO4 1.2, Na2HPO4 4.8, EGTA 1, calcium gluconate 0.758, MgCl2 1.034, d-glucose 5, ATP 3. pH was 7.2, the Ca2+ activity was 0.1 μm. The access conductance was measured continuously and was 70–140 nS. Currents (voltage clamp) and voltages (current clamp) were recorded using a patch-clamp amplifier (EPC 7, List Medical Electronics, Darmstadt, Germany), the LIH1600 interface and PULSE software (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) as well as Chart software (AD-Instruments, Spechbach, Germany). Data were stored continuously on a computer hard disc and were analyzed using PULSE software. In regular intervals, membrane voltages (Vc) were clamped in steps of 10 mV from −50 to +50 mV. Membrane conductance Gm was calculated from the measured current (I) and Vc values according to Ohm's law. All compounds used were of high grade of purity and were from Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany) or Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). All cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Student's t test (for paired or unpaired samples as appropriate), and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for statistical analysis. p values <0.05 were accepted as significant. The relative expression levels of mRNA encoding the 10 anoctamins was measured in a broad range of murine tissues, using real time RT-PCR (Fig. 1). Expression of the different ANO mRNAs can be subdivided into three groups. ANO2, 3, and 4 are predominantly expressed in neuronal tissues. For ANO2 the highest mRNA expression was found in the eye. In contrast ANO3 and ANO4 mRNA were equally expressed in spinal cord, brain stem, cerebellum, and eye. As a second group ANO6, ANO8, and ANO10 are equally expressed in all tissues. A third group is formed by ANO proteins that are expressed in particular tissues: Highest levels of ANO5 expression was found in skeletal muscle and thyroid gland. The thyroid gland shows high levels of expression for a number of different anoctamins, such as ANO1, ANO5, ANO8, ANO9, and ANO10. ANO7 is found predominantly in the stomach. ANO1 mRNA is expressed in all electrolyte transporting tissues like trachea, pancreas, colon, salivary gland, and prostate tissue. Epithelial tissues therefore express ANO1, ANO5, ANO6, ANO7, ANO8, ANO9, and ANO10 (“epithelial anoctamins”), which were examined more closely in subsequent functional studies. To screen the different anoctamins for Cl− channel function we decided to use FTR cells as an expression system. Filter cultures of FRT cells form high-resistance epithelial monolayers and have very low endogenous ion conductance. Also cells grown on glass coverslips have a low membrane conductance and lack of endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− channels (9.Caputo A. Caci E. Ferrera L. Pedemonte N. Barsanti C. Sondo E. Pfeffer U. Ravazzolo R. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Science. 2008; 322: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Also in the present YFP-based fluorescence assays, endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− conductance was not detectable in mock-transfected cells, after stimulation with ATP or ionomycin (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). Moreover, CFTR currents have not been detected in FRT cells (18.Galietta L.J. Springsteel M.F. Eda M. Niedzinski E.J. By K. Haddadin M.J. Kurth M.J. Nantz M.H. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19723-19728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and thus stimulation with IBMX and forskolin was without any effect (Fig. 4). However, we recently found that various TMEM16 proteins are expressed in basically every cell line (15.Kunzelmann K. Kongsuphol P. AlDehni F. Tian Y. Ousingsawat J. Warth R. Schreiber R. Cell Calcium. 2009; 46: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and therefore performed RT-PCR to detect expression of endogenous anoctamins in FRT cells. Whereas FRT cells do not express ANO1, ANO2, ANO3, ANO4, ANO5, ANO7, and ANO9, they clearly show expression of ANO6, ANO8, and ANO10 (Fig. 2A). Because all cell lines express anoctamins, there is always the probability that ion currents produced by overexpression of anoctamins are contaminated to some degree by endogenous anoctamins (15.Kunzelmann K. Kongsuphol P. AlDehni F. Tian Y. Ousingsawat J. Warth R. Schreiber R. Cell Calcium. 2009; 46: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Expression of ANO proteins in FRT cells.A, total RNA was isolated from Fisher rat thyroid (FRT) cells and RT-PCR was performed to identify endogenous expression of ANO proteins.

His-tagged anoctamins were readily expressed in FRT cells as demonstrated by Western blotting, as shown for ANO1, -2, and -6 (Fig. 2B). Expression of His-tagged anoctamins (ANO1, ANO2, ANO5, ANO6, ANO7L (large isoform), ANO7S (short isoform), ANO9, and ANO10) was verified by immunocytochemistry using a primary anti-His antibody. Co-staining of β-catenin suggested plasma membrane expression for most ANO proteins (yellow color in the overlays) (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S1). Membrane expression was most obvious for ANO1 and ANO2. It was much reduced for ANO10 and was intracellular for ANO7, ANO8, ANO9, and ANO10. Notably, the short isoform of ANO7 (ANO7S) was detected in the nucleus (19.Galindo B.E. Vacquier V.D. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2005; 16: 919-924PubMed Google Scholar). Similar data were obtained when anoctamins were co-stained with F-actin (supplemental Fig. S2). No immunofluorescence was detected in mock-transfected control cells. The activity of ANO proteins overexpressed in FRT cells was assessed by I− quenching of coexpressed halide-sensitive YFP (20.Pedemonte N. Lukacs G.L. Du K. Caci E. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2564-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). To that end FRT cells were cotransfected with anoctamin and the yellow fluorescence protein YFP-I152L. The initial slope of fluorescence quenching by I− correlates directly with the Cl− channel activity (20.Pedemonte N. Lukacs G.L. Du K. Caci E. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2564-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). In cells transfected with empty vector only (control), the initial I− uptake rate was not increased by purinergic stimulation with ATP (100 μm) (Fig. 4A). We also examined if a cAMP-activated whole-cell conductance is present in control cells, by stimulating with IBMX (100 μm) and forskolin (2 μm), which, however, did not enhance YFP-quenching (Figs. 4A and 5). In contrast expression of ANO1 caused an increase in initial (basal) I− uptake rate and provided an ATP-induced increase in I− uptake (Figs. 4B and 5). Compared with ANO1, expression of the other epithelial anoctamins (ANO5, ANO6, ANO7, ANO8, ANO9, ANO10) and ANO2 induced very little Ca2+ (ATP)-activated Cl− conductance (Fig. 5). Ca2+-activated Cl− conductance was only detected for ANO2, ANO6, and both the long and the short form of ANO7 and none of the expressed anoctamins induced a cAMP-(IBMX/forskolin) dependent anion conductance. Rather surprisingly, ANO9 and ANO10 reduced both basal and ATP-induced anion conductance. Notably, coexpression of ANO9 inhibited both basal and ATP-induced anion conductance produced by ANO1 (Fig. 8). These results suggest that not all anoctamins produce Ca2+-activated Cl− channels and that some members of the anoctamin family have rather a dominant negative effect on Ca2+-activated Cl− conductance. To exclude the possibility that not all anoctamins examined here are activated by purinergic receptors, we decided to increase intracellular Ca2+ directly using the Ca2+ionophore ionomycin (1 μm). Control cells did not respond to ionomycin and showed only little quenching by I− (Fig. 6A). Of all anoctamins examined, only ANO1 induced a higher basal anion conductance and an ionomycin-activated Cl− conductance, whereas ANO9 and ANO10 reduced both basal and ionomycin-induced anion conductance (Figs. 6 and 7). The ANO1-induced Cl− conductance was strongly inhibited by removal of Ca2+ from the extracellular bath solution, indicating that the ANO1 current is strictly depending on Ca2+.FIGURE 7Ionomycin-activated ANO1 in FRT cells. Summary of the effects of ionomycin (1 μm) on I− uptake in FRT cells overexpressing anoctamins. Basal I− uptake (basal) in FRT cells was increased by expression of ANO1. I− uptake was activated by ionomycin (1 μm) in cells expressing ANO1, but not in cells expressing other anoctamin proteins. Values are mean ± S.E. (#, paired t test to basal activity, p < 0.05; §, ANOVA to control, p < 0.05; n, number of cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FRT cells have a small but detectable basal Cl− conductance that could be produced by any of the endogenously expressed anoctamins (ANO6, 8, 10) (Fig. 2). We noticed that expression of ANO9 and ANO10 inhibited this basal anion conductance (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). We would therefore suggest that the endogenous anion conductance is produced by ANO6 but is antagonized by endogenous ANO10, probably due to hetero-oligomerization of both anoctamins or by reduced membrane trafficking of ANO6 in the presence of ANO10. To further verify the inhibitory effects of ANO9 and ANO10 on other anoctamins, we expressed ANO1, which induced a large Cl− conductance, in the absence or presence of ANO9 or ANO10. In fact, both basal and ATP-induced ANO1 conductance was largely inhibited by coexpression of ANO9, while coexpression of ANO10 showed only little effects, possible because endogenous ANO10 levels are already high (Fig. 8). However, this result clearly indicates that different anoctamins interfere with each other. We further examined Ca2+ (ATP)-dependent activation of anoctamins in patch-clamp experiments. To our surprise, we found that FRT cells show endogenous ATP-activated whole-cell Cl− currents (Fig. 9A, left trace). Unlike the typical fast-activating Cl− current that is generated by ANO1 (Fig. 9A, right trace), this endogenous Cl− current is slowly activating, and of somewhat smaller amplitude and has not been detected in the YFP-quenching experiments. The endogenous Ca2+-activated whole-cell current in mock-transfected cells, which is probably because of expression of endogenous anoctamins (ANO 6, 8, 10) showed a larger current for Cl− than I−, whereas the whole-cell current that was produced by overexpressed ANO1, was increased when bath Cl− was replaced by I− (Fig. 9B). ANO1 and ANO10 overexpressed in FRT cells showed a permeability sequence of I− > Br− > Cl−, while their conductivity was similar for I− and Cl− (Table 1).TABLE 1Halide permeability (P) and conductivity (G) ratio of ANO1 and ANO10PI/PClPBr/PClGI/GClGBr/GClAMO1 (10)1.50 ± 0.091.21 ± 0.041.13 ± 0.031.09 ± 0.03AMO10 (6)1.45 ± 0.191.20 ± 0.071.04 ± 0.161.00 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab Anoctamins currents were also activated directly by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ through perfusion of the Ca2+ containing (1 μm) pipette-filling solution into the cytosol, upon establishing a whole-cell configuration. Whole-cell currents were activated in mock-transfected cells and cells overexpressing ANO1, ANO2, (ANO6), and ANO10 (Fig. 10B). Activation was rapid in ANO1 expressing cells, but was slow for control (mock) or ANO2,6,10-expressing cells (Figs. 9C and 10B). Notably, activation of ANO1 was suppressed by Ca2+-free pipette solution (dashed red line), while slow activation of endogenous currents was not inhibited (black dashed line in Fig. 10B). Moreover, slow current activation was not inhibited by 5 μm of the CAMKII inhibitor KN62 (data not shown). Notably, ANO1 currents were well inhibited (about 60%) by 100 μm niflumic acid (F; 100 μm), while ANO10 currents, or endogenous currents (mock) were only slightly inhibited (about 20%) (Figs. 9C and 10D). Niflumic acid had no effects on ANO6-expressing cells. Moreover we examined the Ca2+ sensitivity for the different anoctamins by loading the patch pipette with different Ca2+ concentrations. We found that ANO1 and ANO6 require somewhat higher cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations (EC50% = 0.7 μm) than endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− currents or ANO10 (EC50% = 0.2 μm) (Fig. 10A). At about 10 μm [Ca2+]i, ANO1 was maximally activated, which corresponds well to earlier data (7.Yang Y.D. Cho H. Koo J.Y. Tak M.H. Cho Y. Shim W.S. Park S.P. Lee J. Lee B. Kim B.M. Raouf R. Shin Y.K. Oh U. Nature. 2008; 455: 1210-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar), and was then inhibited by further increase of cytosolic Ca2+. Cl− currents generated by endogenous anoctamins or ANO10 were inhibited already at 10 μm Ca2+, indicating enhanced inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on these anoctamins. Notably, although ANO9 and ANO10 reduced maximal currents produced by ANO1 (Fig. 8), initial activation of the current (30 s after establishing a whole-cell recording) was reduced by siRNA suppression of endogenous ANO10 (Fig. 10C). Taken together, these results indicate that the different members of the anoctamin family produce Ca2+-activated Cl− currents of remarkably different regulatory properties, which may be essential for their function in different types of epithelial cells (1.Hartzell C. Putzier I. Arreola J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 719-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). ANO1 has been identified recently as a protein that produces Ca2+-activated Cl− currents with properties, archetypical for endogenous CaCCs (7.Yang Y.D. Cho H. Koo J.Y. Tak M.H. Cho Y. Shim W.S. Park S.P. Lee J. Lee B. Kim B.M. Raouf R. Shin Y.K. Oh U. Nature. 2008; 455: 1210-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 8.Schroeder B.C. Cheng T. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Science. 2008; 322: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Evidence has been provided that ANO1 itself operates as a Cl− channel, however it is currently not clear whether additional channel subunits are required to build a complete CaCC (7.Yang Y.D. Cho H. Koo J.Y. Tak M.H. Cho Y. Shim W.S. Park S.P. Lee J. Lee B. Kim B.M. Raouf R. Shin Y.K. Oh U. Nature. 2008; 455: 1210-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 8.Schroeder B.C. Cheng T. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 2008; 134: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). The channel is clearly regulated by cytosolic Ca2+, however, no obvious Ca2+ binding site has been identified within ANO1, which may suggest additional channel subunits (discussed in Ref. 15.Kunzelmann K. Kongsuphol P. AlDehni F. Tian Y. Ousingsawat J. Warth R. Schreiber R. Cell Calcium. 2009; 46: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Alternatively the channel is not directly regulated by Ca2+ but rather through calmodulin (CAM) and CAM-dependent kinase. Both direct activation by Ca2+ and CAMKII-dependent regulation has been described extensively (discussed in Refs. 1.Hartzell C. Putzier I. Arreola J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 719-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 15.Kunzelmann K. Kongsuphol P. AlDehni F. Tian Y. Ousingsawat J. Warth R. Schreiber R. Cell Calcium. 2009; 46: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although ANO1 belongs to a larger family of 10 homologous proteins, it was unclear whether all anoctamins produce Ca2+-activated Cl− channels. The present data, obtained in fluorescence-based assay and by patch clamping suggest that at least some of the epithelial anoctamins produce Ca2+-activated Cl− channels, or major components of it. While some anoctamins (ANO1) produce strong currents, others generate small CaCCs that are only detected by patch clamping. A remarkable finding was that the endogenous ATP-activated Cl− current and also overexpressed ANO10 is only very slowly activated over a time frame of about 10 min (and may therefore escape detection in the fluorescence-based assay). This is in sharp contrast to ANO1, which is activated within seconds of exposure to Ca2+ (Fig. 9). This differences could be sue to a missing accessory subunit that is required (but missing in FRT cells) to speed up activation of ANO10. Similar has been found for KCNQ-K+ channels that have KCNE proteins as β-subunits (21.Schroeder B.C. Waldegger S. Fehr S. Bleich M. Warth R. Greger R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 22.Heitzmann D. Warth R. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 1119-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Alternatively the mechanism of activation could be variable for the different anoctamins (Ca2+, CAM, or CAMKII). These and other aspects such as differential Ca2+ sensitivity need to be clarified in subsequent studies. The present report shows that FRT cells express ANO6, 8, and 10 endogenously. Several anoctamins are also expressed in each mouse (Fig. 1) and human (15.Kunzelmann K. Kongsuphol P. AlDehni F. Tian Y. Ousingsawat J. Warth R. Schreiber R. Cell Calcium. 2009; 46: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) tissue examined so far. This correlates well with the fact that CaCC is detected in almost every type of tissue (1.Hartzell C. Putzier I. Arreola J. Annu. Rev.

We also observed that CaCC, even if it is not detected in situ in the native cell, will appear during dedifferentiation, proliferation, and development of cancer (15.Kunzelmann K. Kongsuphol P.

Caci E. Ferrera L. Pedemonte N. Barsanti C. Sondo E. Pfeffer U. Ravazzolo R. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Science. 2008; 322: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 27.Galietta L.J.

Because several anoctamins are always present in a given cells, it is difficult to examine overexpressed anoctamins without any background. When screening of a number of cell lines we identified typically 2–5 anoctamin paralogs (15.Kunzelmann K. Kongsuphol P. AlDehni F. Tian Y. Ousingsawat J. Warth R. Schreiber R. Cell Calcium. 2009; 46: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Assuming that all anoctamins induce CaCC activity, it is surprising to find that not all of the cell lines examined express Ca2+-activated Cl− currents (15.Kunzelmann K. Kongsuphol P. AlDehni F.

Alternatively, additional proteins could be required, or plasma membrane localization varies between cell lines. It is also entirely possible that some epithelial anoctamins require polarization of the cells for proper membrane expression. The present data show that Ca2+-activated Cl− currents produced by different anoctamins are variable in terms of size, Ca2+ sensitivity, halide permeability, sensitivity toward inhibitors, and time required for activation, The data show that several anoctamins are expressed in epithelial cells and may interfere with each other (Fig. 8). This may provide the characteristic features of Ca2+-activated Cl− conductance in a particular cell type and may explain why Ca2+-activated Cl− currents are so heterogeneous in different cell types (1.Hartzell C.

In contrast, archaeal ubiquitin-like proteins are less conserved and not known to function in protein conjugation. This has complicated our understanding of the origins of ubiquitination and its connection to proteasomes. Here we report two small archaeal modifier proteins, SAMP1 and SAMP2, with a beta-grasp fold and carboxy-terminal diglycine motif similar to ubiquitin, that form protein conjugates in the archaeon Haloferax volcanii. The levels of SAMP-conjugates were altered by nitrogen-limitation and proteasomal gene knockout and spanned various functions including components of the Urm1 pathway. LC-MS/MS-based collision-induced dissociation demonstrated isopeptide bonds between the C-terminal glycine of SAMP2 and the epsilon-amino group of lysines from a number of protein targets and Lys 58 of SAMP2 itself, revealing poly-SAMP chains. The widespread distribution and diversity of pathways modified by SAMPylation suggest that this type of protein conjugation is central to the archaeal lineage."
https://openalex.org/W1977622381,"There is ample evidence of a magnetic field near the centre of our Galaxy, but much uncertainty as to its strength. Estimates vary from the microgauss to the milligauss range — and values as great as 1,000 microgauss, about 10,000 times stronger than typical for the bulk of the Galaxy, have been reported. A new analysis of published radio and γ-ray data reveals a downward break in the region's non-thermal radio spectrum that suggests a Galactic Centre magnetic field of 50 microgauss or more. Taken with other evidence, the authors conclude that a field strength of about 100 microgauss is probable, on a par with that found in the inner regions of starburst galaxies. The amplitude of the magnetic field near the Galactic Centre has been uncertain by two orders of magnitude for several decades. A compilation of previous data now reveals a downward break in the region's non-thermal radio spectrum; this requires that the Galactic Centre field be at least ∼50 microgauss on 400 parsec scales, with evidence supporting a field of 100 microgauss. This would imply that over 10% of the Galaxy's magnetic energy is contained in only around 0.05% (or less) of its volume. The amplitude of the magnetic field near the Galactic Centre has been uncertain by two orders of magnitude for several decades. On a scale of ∼100 parsecs (pc), fields of ∼1,000 microgauss (μG; refs 1–3) have been reported, implying a magnetic energy density more than 10,000 times stronger than typical for the Galaxy. Alternatively, the assumption of pressure equilibrium between the various phases of the Galactic Centre interstellar medium (including turbulent molecular gas, the contested4 ‘very hot’ plasma, and the magnetic field) suggests fields of ∼100 μG over ∼400 pc size scales5. Finally, assuming equipartition, fields of only ∼6 μG have been inferred from radio observations6 for 400 pc scales. Here we report a compilation of previous data that reveals a downward break in the region's non-thermal radio spectrum (attributable to a transition from bremsstrahlung to synchrotron cooling of the in situ cosmic-ray electron population). We show that the spectral break requires that the Galactic Centre field be at least ∼50 μG on 400 pc scales, lest the synchrotron-emitting electrons produce too much γ-ray emission, given other existing constraints7. Other considerations support a field of 100 μG, implying that over 10% of the Galaxy's magnetic energy is contained in only ≲0.05% of its volume."

Recently, we have shown that FSTL1 acts as a muscle-derived secreted factor that is up-regulated by Akt activation and ischemic stress and that FSTL1 exerts favorable actions on the heart and vasculature. Here, we sought to identify the receptor that mediates the cellular actions of FSTL1. We identified DIP2A as a novel FSTL1-binding partner from the membrane fraction of endothelial cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed a direct physical interaction between FSTL1 and DIP2A. DIP2A was present on the cell surface of endothelial cells, and knockdown of DIP2A by small interfering RNA reduced the binding of FSTL1 to cells. In cultured endothelial cells, knockdown of DIP2A by small interfering RNA diminished FSTL1-stimulated survival, migration, and differentiation into network structures and inhibited FSTL1-induced Akt phosphorylation. In cultured cardiac myocytes, ablation of DIP2A reduced the protective actions of FSTL1 on hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis and suppressed FSTL1-induced Akt phosphorylation. These data indicate that DIP2A functions as a novel receptor that mediates the cardiovascular protective effects of FSTL1."

More than 150 pigmentation-related genes have been identified, including glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein b (GPNMB). A recent proteomics analysis revealed that GPNMB is localized in melanosomes, and GPNMB is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that shows high homology with a well-known melanosomal structural protein, Pmel17/gp100. In this study, we show that GPNMB is expressed in melanocytes of normal human skin, as well as in human melanoma cells. GPNMB is heavily glycosylated and is enriched in mature (stage III and IV) melanosomes in contrast to MART-1 and Pmel17, which are abundant in early (stage I and II) melanosomes. MART-1 and Pmel17 play critical roles in the maturation of early melanosomes; thus, we speculate that GPNMB might be important in the functions of late melanosomes, possibly their transport and/or transfer to keratinocytes. We also demonstrate that a secreted form of GPNMB is released by ectodomain shedding from the largely Golgi-modified form of GPNMB and that the PKC and Ca2+ intracellular signaling pathways regulate that shedding. We conclude that GPNMB is a melanosomal protein that is released by proteolytic ectodomain shedding and might be a useful and specific histological marker of melanocytic cells.—Hoashi, T., Sato, S., Yamaguchi, Y., Passeron, T., Tamaki, K., Hearing, V.

The following cell populations were analyzed: CD34+, CD133+, CD34+/KDR+, CD34+/VE cadherin+, and endothelial cell colony-forming units (CFU-ECs). Progression was defined as a >15% DS increase of the objective vessel at follow-up. At 24 mo, 57 patients (42%) experienced significant progression.

https://openalex.org/W1994489009,"Endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis, such as thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), are promising sources of therapeutic agents to treat angiogenesis-driven diseases, including cancer. TSP-1 regulates angiogenesis through different mechanisms, including binding and sequestration of the angiogenic factor fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), through a site located in the calcium binding type III repeats. We hypothesized that the FGF-2 binding sequence of TSP-1 might serve as a template for the development of inhibitors of angiogenesis. Using a peptide array approach followed by binding assays with synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins, we identified a FGF-2 binding sequence of TSP-1 in the 15-mer sequence DDDDDNDKIPDDRDN. Molecular dynamics simulations, taking the full flexibility of the ligand and receptor into account, and nuclear magnetic resonance identified the relevant residues and conformational determinants for the peptide-FGF interaction. This information was translated into a pharmacophore model used to screen the NCI2003 small molecule databases, leading to the identification of three small molecules that bound FGF-2 with affinity in the submicromolar range. The lead compounds inhibited FGF-2-induced endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and affected angiogenesis induced by FGF-2 in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay. These small molecules, therefore, represent promising leads for the development of antiangiogenic agents. Altogether, this study demonstrates that new biological insights obtained by integrated multidisciplinary approaches can be used to develop small molecule mimics of endogenous proteins as therapeutic agents."

Because maturation of the 28 S rRNA was unaffected in hUTP18-depleted cells, our results suggest that the integrity of both the 18 S and 28 S rRNA synthesis pathways can be monitored independently by the p53 pathway. Interestingly, accumulation of p53 after hUTP18 knock down required the ribosomal protein L11.

Grafting of complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from 15 different rabbit monoclonal antibodies onto FW1.4 and their derivatives resulted in humanized scFvs with binding affinities in the range from 4.7 × 10−9 to 1.5 × 10−11 m.

As an alternative to hybridoma screening, in vitro display technologies, e.g. phage and ribosome display, enable the selection of high affinity-binding variable domains from natural or synthetic genetic libraries. Despite the successful use of in vitro randomization and selection systems, generation of antibodies by immunization and subsequent screening of full-size antibodies (e.g. hybridoma supernatants) includes conceptual advantages. For example, in contrast to in vitro display systems, in vivo methods are less prone to preferential selection of well expressed clones, which in many cases results in loss of potentially interesting antibodies. Moreover, in vivo methods are preferred in particular for addressing complex antigens, such as integral membrane proteins that are notoriously difficult to purify. However, reducing a full-length monoclonal antibody to the scFv format frequently is challenging particularly due to solubility and stability problems, which often impair expression and purification. Therefore, technologies to humanize and stabilize the scFv format following isolation of a monoclonal antibody remain critical for the generation of scFv therapeutics. single-chain Fv antibody factor complementarity determining region tumor necrosis-α vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay surface plasmon resonance wild type Fourier-transformed infrared differential scanning calorimeter nitrilotriacetic acid human umbilical vein endothelial cell high pressure liquid chromatography human. Numerous approaches have been described to improve biophysical properties of the scFv format (3.Wörn A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 989-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), which can be grouped into two categories. In the first category, variable domains of pre-existing scFvs are engineered for improved stability, either by rationally altering specific positions in the framework regions (4.Wörn A. Plückthun A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13120-13127Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 5.Steipe B. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 388: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6.Steipe B. Schiller B.

Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2006; 19: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the second category, stabilization of the binding moiety is achieved by loop grafting, i.e. transplantation of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) onto acceptor frameworks with suitable biophysical properties. For example, loop grafting of rodent CDRs onto a suitable consensus human variable domain framework was shown to result in superior stability of the resulting scFv fragment (14.Ewert S. Honegger A. Plückthun A. Methods. 2004; 34: 184-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This approach is particularly interesting for the generation of scFvs for therapeutic applications, because it combines stabilization and humanization in one step. However, because of the high structural diversity, particularly of rodent variable domains, a relatively large repertoire of human acceptor frameworks is required to match the major subtypes (15.Knappik A. Ge L. Honegger A. Pack P. Fischer M. Wellnhofer G. Hoess A. Wölle J. Plückthun A. Virnekäs B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 57-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In addition, further amino acid substitutions in the human framework regions are often required to restore the conformation of animal CDRs (16.Carter P. Presta L. Gorman C.M. Ridgway J.B. Henner D. Wong W.L. Rowland A.M. Kotts C. Carver M.E. Shepard H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 4285-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar, 17.Adair J.R. Athwal D.S. Bodmer M.W.

As a consequence, humanization of antibodies is frequently subject to engineering strategies specifically designed for every individual donor sequence, and it is particularly challenging for the scFv format because these fragments tend to aggregate and are difficult to produce. As a result, the outcome of such laborious efforts is unpredictable in many cases, and the overall success rate is low when compared with humanization of Fabs or IgGs. In contrast to humans and rodents, framework variability in rabbits is very limited because one VH germ line gene segment is preferentially used and accounts for 80–90% of VDJ genes, which are combined with multiple but homologous VJ genes coding for the light chain. This apparent limitation of antibody diversity in rabbits is compensated by a high degree of N-nucleotide addition at VD and DJ junctions. Further VDJ gene diversification occurs by somatic hypermutation and gene conversion-like mechanisms upon antigenic stimulation (reviewed in Ref. 21.Lanning D. Zhu X. Zhai S.K. Knight K.L. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 175: 214-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence of preferential VH1 gene segment usage, high homology among Vκ gene segments, and) usage of gene conversion during antibody diversification, rabbit variable domain frameworks are very homologous to each other. Furthermore, following immunization, rabbit antibodies mostly show significantly higher affinities when compared with rodent antibodies. 4L. Borras, T. Gunde, J. Tietz, U. Bauer, V. Hulmann-Cottier, J. P. A. Grimshaw, and D. M. Urech, unpublished data. Thus, because of their high affinities and the relatively low structural diversity, rabbit antibodies present an ideal starting point for the development of a generally applicable protocol to generate humanized scFv therapeutics. In the work presented here, we used a single human scFv scaffold of the Vκ1-VH3 subtype to generate a set of scFvs with high affinity by grafting of CDRs from 15 different rabbit monoclonal antibodies directed against tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This scaffold was previously identified from a human library using a whole genome screening approach (22.Auf der Maur A. Tissot K. Barberis A. Methods. 2004; 34: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We further identified a motif consisting of five rationally altered framework positions, which, when introduced into the human acceptor scaffold, improved protein stability and supported functional presentation of rabbit CDRs. Most resulting antibody fragments exhibited excellent solubility, thermal stability, and affinity and were successfully produced with high yields in a generic refolding process from inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. Rabbit monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated in collaboration with Epitomics Inc. Briefly, New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with recombinant human VEGF165 (PeproTech EC Ltd., London, UK) and peptides thereof or with recombinant human TNF-α. Spleen cells of the immunized rabbits were fused with rabbit immortal B cells (240E-W2) as described previously (23.Huang Y. Gu B. Wu R. Zhang J. Li Y. Zhang M. Hybridoma. 2007; 26: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For VEGF binders, 23,040 hybridomas were screened for the presence of rabbit mAbs to human VEGF165 by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Neutralizing activity of the 248 positive hybridomas was assessed using a VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) blocking ELISA. Out of 92 hybridomas showing inhibition of VEGF binding to VEGFR2, 23 hybridomas were selected based on consistent results in the VEGFR2-blocking ELISA and cloned twice using limiting dilution technique. Binding affinities of cloned hybridomas toward human VEGF165 were measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), using a BIAcore T-100 instrument (Biacore Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). Total RNA of the seven hybridomas secreting the most potent rabbit mAbs was isolated from hybridoma cells, and the cDNAs encoding the variable light and variable heavy chain were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR. After PCR amplification, sequenced DNA fragments were ligated into a mammalian expression vector containing rabbit CL and CH domains. Correctness of amplified VL and VH domains was confirmed by transient expression of the rabbit mAbs in human 293 cells and subsequent analysis of 293 cell supernatants using the VEGFR2 blocking assay and SPR measurements. For TNF binders, supernatants of 5640 hybridomas were screened for binding to human TNF-α in ELISA. Out of 142 hits, 44 neutralized TNF-α induced cytotoxicity in murine L929 cells. Following cloning of the 44 confirmed hits, binding affinity to human TNF-α was determined by SPR measurements. Eight antibodies were selected for humanization and reformatting based on potency in the L929 assay. Antibody variable domain sequences were aligned using ClustalW (24.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G.

The Kabat numbering scheme was used for nomenclature of residue positions as well as for the definition of CDRs, except CDR-H1 (25.Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1709-1719PubMed Google Scholar). The boundaries of CDR-H1 vary substantially depending on whether loop structure or sequence variability criteria are considered for the CDR definition. Therefore, in this study CDR-H1 was defined from residue VH 26 to VH 35, which is a combination of Kabat and Chotia definitions and takes into account both structural and sequence variability. Nomenclature and overview of the human and rabbit immunoglobulin germ line sequences were according to the International ImMunoGeneTics information system (IMGT Montpellier, France). The most closely related V-gene germ line sequences were identified based on homology of VH and VL segments of each hybridoma clone to rabbit germ line sequences. Amino acid alignments were evaluated from residues 1 to 88 (for VL) and from 1 to 92 (for VH). A pool of 88-well folding and stable scFv antibodies previously isolated from a library generated by amplification and random combination of human VH and VL domains from a naive human spleen cDNA (22.Auf der Maur A. Tissot K. Barberis A. Methods. 2004; 34: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was analyzed to select a suitable acceptor framework for rabbit CDR grafting. Human scFv sequences were ranked as follows: (a) according to expression level of the respective clone in yeast, and (b) according to homology to rabbit consensus at core residues. Core residues were defined as residue positions with less than 10% average relative side-chain accessibility to the solvent using information by Honegger and Pluckthun (26.Honegger A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Each of the two domains selected to generate the acceptor scFv scaffold FW1.4 (clone kI27 assigned to germ line IGKV1-5 and a43 assigned to germ line IGHV3-23) corresponds to a mature human scFv clone that showed high levels of soluble expression in yeast. The amino acid sequence of FW1.4 is as follows: EIVMTQSPSTLSASVGDRVIITC*CDRL1*WYQQKPGKAPKLLIY*CDRL2* GVPSRFSGSGSGAEFTLTISSLQPDDFATYYC*CDRL3*FGQGTKLTVLGGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSEVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAAS*CDRH1*WVRQAPGKGLEWVS*CDRH2*RFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAK*CDRH3*WGQGTLVTVSS (underlines indicate CDRs; asterisks separate the known amino acid sequence of the framework from unknown CDR sequences). A first minimalistic humanized version was generated for each of the 15 rabbit monoclonal antibodies by combining sequences of their CDRs with framework region sequences of the human scFv acceptor scaffold FW1.4. A second series of “optimized” grafts was generated by CDR transfer onto optimized derivatives of FW1.4 (referred to as FW1.4opt). Human framework residues were substituted as follows: (a) at positions that are relevant for CDR conformation by the respective amino acids used in rabbit sequences and (b) by grafting of donor amino acids that potentially are in contact with the antigen. Due to the lack of crystal structures of rabbit antibody variable domains, selection of positions relevant for CDR conformation were identified based on literature data (14.Ewert S. Honegger A. Plückthun A. Methods. 2004; 34: 184-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16.Carter P. Presta L. Gorman C.M. Ridgway J.B. Henner D. Wong W.L. Rowland A.M. Kotts C. Carver M.E. Shepard H.M.

Resulting clones contained such substitutions at selected subsets of position as follows: L69, H23, H24, H49, H67, H69, H71, H73, H78, and H94. Framework residues that potentially interact with the antigen were identified by alignment of the rabbit variable domains with the nearest germ line counterpart (for VL) or the rabbit variable heavy domain consensus sequence (for VH). Differences between aligned sequences were hypothesized to result from in vivo affinity maturation. Such mutations at positions predicted to be solvent-exposed and in proximity to the antigen-binding site as well as the rare mutations that were found at the positions mentioned above involved in CDR conformation were transferred to the acceptor framework. Information about solvent exposure of residues was extracted from a sequence analysis by Honegger and Pluckthun (26.Honegger A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Pro and Gly residues introduced as result of the somatic hypermutation process were substituted if such mutations were found in the proximity of CDRs. DNA sequences encoding CDR-grafted scFvs were optimized for E. coli codon usage, GC content, mRNA secondary structure, codon and motif repeats, and restriction sites, using LETO software package (Entelechon GmbH, Regensburg, Germany). Overlapping oligonucleotides matching the optimized DNA sequence were synthesized, and genes were generated by overlap extension techniques (27.Mountain A. Adair J.R. Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev. 1992; 10: 1-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A (Gly4Ser)4 linker was used to connect VL and VH domains. All scFv genes contained 5′- and 3′-flanking NcoI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively, that allowed cloning into the proprietary E. coli inclusion body expression vector. Additional AccIII and BamHI sites were introduced in the linker sequence to enable domain shuffling. Two derivatives were made for the humanized scFvs derived from each of the rabbit monoclonal antibodies 34, 43, 511, and 578 by domain shuffling. For this, domains containing back mutations to donor residues in the framework regions (optimized grafts; FW1.4opt) were paired with the domains lacking mutations in the framework (minimalistic grafts; FW1.4) using standard DNA cloning techniques. E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with the respective inclusion body expression plasmids were grown at 37 °C in dYT medium containing the appropriate antibiotics. Protein expression was initiated by addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration) at an absorbance (A600) of about 2.0. Three hours after induction, E. coli cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication, and inclusion bodies were isolated by repeated washing and centrifugation steps. Inclusion bodies were solubilized at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in the presence of 6 m Gdn-HCl and reduced by addition of 20 mm dithiothreitol. Basic refolding screenings were performed to select best pH, redox system (cystine/cysteine), and salt concentrations from the range of tested conditions. Best conditions for each individual scFv were then used for a lab-scale refolding process. For this, the scFv proteins were renatured by rapid dilution into a 50-fold volume of refolding buffer. After up-concentration and dialysis against PBS buffer, pH 6.0, proteins were purified using size-exclusion chromatography. Content and purity of eluted fractions were assessed by SDS-PAGE and size-exclusion HPLC. Refolding yield was expressed as amount (milligrams) of refolded protein obtained out of 1 liter of refolding solution. For SPR measurements, periplasmic fractions containing anti-VEGF “wild type” (WT) scFvs and anti-TNF WT scFvs were prepared. Overnight starter cultures were made by inoculating single E. coli BL21(DE3) colonies from LB plates into 2-ml cultures of dYT medium with suitable antibiotics and 1% glucose in a 37 °C shaker. 1.5 ml of expression medium (dYT with 45 mm K2HPO4, antibiotics, 0.1% glucose) was inoculated with 150 μl of the overnight cultures (in triplicate). The bacterial cultures were incubated in a 30 °C shaker until A595 reached 1.5–2. Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Three hours after induction, cultures were harvested by centrifuging for 10 min at 4500 rpm. The pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of fractionation buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% sucrose, 500 μg/ml lysozyme), and each set of triplicates was pooled. After a static incubation at room temperature for 15 min, an equal volume of cold water was added, and the suspension was incubated for a further 15 min. The supernatant was then recovered as a periplasmic fraction by centrifuging for 15 min in a bench top centrifuge (13,000 rpm and 4 °C). Thermostability measurements were performed using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and a Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer. Samples were first dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5). DSC was performed using a MicroCal high throughput VP-Capillary-DSC (Microcal, Northhampton, MA). Measurements of the difference in heat capacity between the scFv samples in solution and reference buffer were performed using protein concentrations of ∼1.0 mg/ml. Measurements were performed over a temperature range from 25 to 95 °C at a scan rate of 3.3 °C/min. Data were analyzed using the Origin plotting software (OriginLab, Northhampton, MA). Apparent melting temperatures were estimated from DSC scans after concentration normalization and subtraction of the buffer-buffer baseline. FTIR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer equipped with an attenuated total reflectance Bio-ATR cell (Bruker Optics, Faellanden, Switzerland). Changes in secondary structure of the samples were assessed by heating from 25 to 95 °C using 5 and 2.5 °C steps for the dynamic range of unfolding. At each temperature, a total of 200 scans was recorded for each spectrum at a resolution of 1 cm−1. All spectra manipulations were performed using OPUS spectroscopy software (Bruker Optics, Faellanden, Switzerland). Buffer reference and transient atmospheric (CO2 and H2O) background were subtracted from the spectra. Second derivative spectra were obtained for the amide I band using a third degree polynomial function with smoothing. Degree of unfolding was assessed by multifactorial analysis of second derivative amide I band shape. A linear calibration curve was generated, assuming 0% unfolding for the spectra at 25, 30, and 35 °C and 100% unfolding for the spectra at the three highest temperatures (85, 90 and 95 °C), which is adequate for most scFvs. Thermal unfolding curves were determined by fitting the FTIR spectra to a linear regression as a function of temperature using the calibration curve. The reported apparent melting temperatures (Tm) for the various scFvs correspond to the temperature of 50% unfolding. For binding kinetics measurements, SPR measurements with BIAcoreTM-T100 were employed. All measurements were performed at 25 °C. Carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM4, GE Healthcare) were activated with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide according to the supplier's instructions, and recombinant human VEGF165 (PeproTech EC Ltd., London, UK) was immobilized on a CM4 sensor chip using a standard amine-coupling procedure to achieve a response of ∼200 resonance units. 2-Fold serial dilutions of VEGF antagonists (20–0.16 nm) in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.05% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) were injected into the flow cells at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 5 min. Dissociation of the anti-VEGF scFv from the VEGF on the CM4 chip was allowed to proceed for 10 min. After each injection cycle, surfaces were regenerated with two injections of 100 mm NaOH. The binding kinetics of anti-TNF scFvs were measured using a nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) sensor chip (Series S Sensor Chip NTA, GE Healthcare) and His-tagged human TNF-α (produced in-house). The chip was loaded with 500 μm NiCl2 diluted in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, and 0.05% surfactant P20, pH 7.4). Human TNF-α (2 nm) was captured through the N-terminal His tag via Ni2+NTA chelation. 3-Fold serial dilutions of TNF antagonists (90 to 0.014 nm) diluted in HBS-EP buffer were injected into the flow cells at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 5 min. Dissociation of the TNF-α antagonists was allowed to proceed for 10 min. Regeneration of the chip surface was performed by injection of regeneration solution (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 350 mm EDTA, and 0.05% surfactant P20, pH 8.3) followed by injection of 50 mm NaOH. Binding kinetics measurements of anti-VEGF WT-scFvs and 578-WT-IgG were performed as described above for humanized VEGF antagonists, using a CM4 sensor chip with immobilized human VEGF165. Binding kinetics of anti-TNF WT-scFvs were measured using a CM5 sensor chip with immobilized human TNF-α. Periplasmic fractions containing His-tagged WT-scFvs (or the 578-WT-IgG hybridoma supernatant) were serially diluted in 2-fold steps in HBS-EP buffer. For VEGF binders, surfaces were regenerated with two injections of 100 or 75 mm NaOH after each cycle, depending on the WT-scFv. For TNF binders, single cycle kinetic measurements were done by sequential injections of an scFv concentration series without any regeneration steps. The apparent dissociation (kd) and association (ka) rate constants and the apparent dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) were calculated with BIAcore T100 evaluation software version 2.0.1 using one-to-one Langmuir binding model (Biacore Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). Because the concentration of the scFvs in the periplasmic fractions was unknown, only the apparent dissociation rate constants were calculated by fitting the dissociation curves to a one-to-one dissociation model (R = R0·exp(−kd·(t − t0)) + offset). Recombinant human VEGFR2-Fc chimera (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN), consisting of amino acid residues 1–764 of the extracellular domain of human VEGFR2 fused to a His6-tagged Fc domain of human IgG1, was coated on a 96-well Maxisorp ELISA plate (Nunc, Langenselbold, Germany) at 0.2 μg/ml in PBS and blocked using PBS with 0.01% BSA and 0.2% Tween 20 (PBST). Biotinylated human VEGF165 (2.6 nm) was first incubated with 2-fold serially diluted anti-VEGF scFvs and ranibizumab (15–0.01 nm) in PBST. After 24 h of incubation at room temperature, the mixtures were transferred to the VEGF receptor-immobilized plate and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. Binding of unblocked human VEGF165 to the immobilized VEGFR2 was detected with streptavidin-HRP conjugates (Stereospecific Detection Technologies, Baesweiler, Germany) followed by addition of substrate (BM Blue POD substrate, Roche Diagnostics). Absorbance at 450 nm was measured usin"

Fibrillar type II collagen is the most prominent component of articular cartilage and other cartilage-like tissues such as notochord. Its in situ macromolecular and packing structures have not been fully characterized, but an understanding of these attributes may help reveal mechanisms of tissue assembly and degradation (as in osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis). In some tissues such as lamprey notochord, the collagen fibrillar organization is naturally crystalline and may be studied by x-ray diffraction. We used diffraction data from native and derivative notochord tissue samples to solve the axial, D-periodic structure of type II collagen via multiple isomorphous replacement. The electron density maps and heavy atom data revealed the conformation of the nonhelical telopeptides and the overall D-periodic structure of collagen type II in native tissues, data that were further supported by structure prediction and transmission electron microscopy. These results help to explain the observed differences in collagen type I and type II fibrillar architecture and indicate the collagen type II cross-link organization, which is crucial for fibrillogenesis. Transmission electron microscopy data show the close relationship between lamprey and mammalian collagen fibrils, even though the respective larger scale tissue architecture differs.

These results help to explain the observed differences in collagen type I and type II fibrillar architecture and indicate the collagen type II cross-link organization, which is crucial for fibrillogenesis. Transmission electron microscopy data show the close relationship between lamprey and mammalian collagen fibrils, even though the respective larger scale tissue architecture differs. Type II collagen fibrils are major components of cartilage, intervertebral discs, and the vitreous humor of the eye and are vital to the normal development of bones and teeth. These fibrils are formed from highly ordered 67-nm staggered arrays of collagen molecules, producing the characteristic D-periodic structure of fibrillar collagens (supplemental Fig. 1). Because the length of the type II collagen molecule (∼300 nm) is not an integer multiple of 67 nm, the fifth molecular segment does not extend across the whole D-period. Therefore, a gap region is defined, where there are only four molecular segments and an overlap region where there are five segments. This arrangement is known as the Hodge-Petruska scheme (see packing/microfibril in supplemental Fig. 1) (1.Petruska J. Hodge A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1964; 51: 871-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Each D-period is composed of arrays of five fragments of five different collagen molecules, which between them contain the complete sequence of one collagen molecule. The type II collagen molecule has three identical α1-polypeptide chains of 1,060 amino acid residues each, with a large uninterrupted triple-helical region and relatively short, nonhelical telopeptides (19 amino acid residues in the N-telopeptide, and 27 amino acid residues in the C-telopeptide) (2.Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar) that do not possess the Gly-Xaa-Yaa-repeating primary structure found in the triple-helical region. The lengths of the α-chains are the same, but they are displaced from one another by one residue in the triple-helix to allow for its proper super coiling (2.Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). In vitro, the polymerization of collagen molecules into fibrils is an entropy-driven self-assembly process (3.Kadler K. Hojima Y. Prockop D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15696-15701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in living tissues, it also involves cellular and specific extracellular matrix interactions (4.Kadler K.E. Hill A. Canty-Laird E.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans (PGs), 3The abbreviations used are: PGproteoglycanTEMtransmission electron microscopy. such as decorin, fibromodulin, and biglycan, bind type II collagen fibrils to stabilize the larger fibril bundles (fibers composed of multiple fibrils). The diameter of the latter being regulated through interactions with the anionic glycosaminoglycan chains and protein cores of the PGs (5.Scott J.E. Haigh M. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the internal order and stability of fibrils are chiefly maintained by intermolecular cross-linking between collagen molecules. Intrafibrillar links are formed through covalent bonds between lysine and hydroxylysine (Hyl, a modified amino acid specific to collagen; single letter abbreviation U) through a Schiff base reaction (6.Prockop D. Berg R.A. Kivirikko K. Uitto J. Biochemistry of Collagen. Plenum Press, New York1976: 163-273Crossref Google Scholar, 7.Robins S.P. Duncan A. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These bonds are formed between Lys and Hyl residues within both the helical and nonhelical telopeptide domains of collagen molecules within each D-period. Thus, it is apparent that although the telopeptides do not have triple-helical structure, they are very important for collagen cross-linking and the assembly of collagen molecules into fibrils (8.Helseth Jr., D.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7118-7128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proper cross-link formation ensures the structural integrity and stability of fibrils and the tissue. Abnormal cross-linking, either enhanced or inhibited, leads to connective tissue diseases such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, glaucoma, and skin fragility in normal aging (9.Eyre D.R. Paz M.A. Gallop P.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 717-748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the proper conformation of telopeptides has been shown to be important for normal fibril structure (10.Bank R.A. Robins S.P. Wijmenga C. Breslau-Siderius L.J.

U.S.A. 1964; 51: 871-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) arrangement of type II collagen, that is, gap and overlap ratio, telopeptide conformations, and cross- link locations, may facilitate our understanding of these conditions. proteoglycan transmission electron microscopy. Structural studies of type II collagen packing has been complicated by the technical limitations its fibrillar nature presents. The insolubility and size of mature collagen molecules makes nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) inviable, and only small fragments of the collagen molecule or synthetic, short collagen-like peptides have been crystallized and studied by (single-crystal) x-ray crystallography thus far (14.Brodsky B. Persikov A.V. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 301-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Furthermore, disruption of the fibril structure to study the constituent collagen molecules in isolation compromises the goal of understanding the molecular packing within fibrils and the native collagen structure within the D-period. Electron microscopy offers significant capabilities for studying fibrillar collagens but does not provide sufficient resolution for characterizing the telopeptide conformation, and sample preparation may disturb subtle, small features such as the telopeptides. Type II collagen fibrils have an intrinsically crystalline D-periodic structure, even though their lateral arrangement is less well ordered (15.Eikenberry E.F. Childs B. Sheren S.B. Parry D.A.

Biol. 1994; 243: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This means that x-ray diffraction experiments on whole intact tissue samples can provide information concerning the axial organization of collagen. Such structural data have been obtained previously (15.Eikenberry E.F. Childs B. Sheren S.B. Parry D.A. Craig A.S. Brodsky B. J. Mol.

We present here the axial D-periodic structure of native type II collagen in lamprey notochord, determined by multiple isomorphous replacement to 1.9 nm resolution. Adult female lampreys were kindly provided by the Ludington Biological Station of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and J. Ellen Marsden of the University of Vermont. The notochords of adult lampreys were carefully harvested and dissected from their sheaths, nearby muscle, and other tissues and stored at pH 7.5 in phosphate-buffered saline (8 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl) or Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl) for 1–6 h at 4 °C before each experiment. The notochord samples were cut longitudinally into pieces (1 × 2 × 25 mm) along their longitudinal axis and mounted in custom made sample holders that provided for 1–2% stretching and preservation of their hydrated state. Isomorphous staining was performed as described previously (17.Orgel J.P. Wess T.J. Miller A. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 137-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20.Bradshaw J.P. Miller A. Wess T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were treated with iodine (KI) and platinum (PtCl3) for 1 h, followed by 15 min of washing in a large excess of buffer. I− ions covalently bind to tyrosine and in some cases histidine, whereas Pt3+ ions associate with the sulfur group of methionine. X-ray diffraction studies were performed primarily using the small and wide angle fiber diffraction instruments on the BioCAT Beamline 18ID at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Some preliminary studies used the wide angle instrument on the BioCARS beamline 14BMC at the Advanced Photon Source. The sample-to-detector distance was 2,000 mm for small-angle x-ray scattering (1–7 meridional orders) and 150 mm for wide-angle x-ray scattering and microfocus wide-angle x-ray scattering (5–37 meridional orders, medium to high resolution fiber crystallography), and the wavelength was 1.033 Å. Diffraction images were recorded on a custom made “Brandeis” detector (48 × 48 micron pixel size) (22.Fischetti R. Stepanov S. Rosenbaum G. Barrea R. Black E. Gore D. Heurich R. Kondrashkina E.

The exposure time was limited to 1 s to safeguard against radiation/heat damage to the portion of the sample being shot. Diffraction images were processed using CCP13 Fiberfix (25.Rajkumar G.

Biol. 1995; 248: 487-493PubMed Google Scholar) software for background subtraction, and CCP13 software was used for measurements of meridional intensities (17.Orgel J.P. Wess T.J. Miller A. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 137-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Measured intensities (supplemental Fig. 2) (squares of amplitudes), were used for calculation of difference Patterson maps and a one-dimensional electron density map of the collagen type II axial unit cell (the D-period) by reverse Fourier transformation (in-house software). The scaling of the experimental amplitudes and the solution of the phases were performed as described previously (17.Orgel J.P. Wess T.J. Miller A. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 137-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 19.Orgel J.P. Irving T.C. Miller A. Wess T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The entire collagen type II sequence is known for human, rat, and mouse, and partial sequences are known for lamprey (the primary source for this study) (ExPASy Sequence Data Bank codes P02458, P05539, P28481, Q2I8Y0, and Q2I8X9). Unlike collagen type I, collagen type II is highly homologous across the species (27.Kadler K. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 491-619PubMed Google Scholar), and its full sequence may therefore be reasonably estimated by homologous comparison (N-terminal half from rat, mouse, and human; C-terminal half from the lamprey sequence, Q2I8X9) (28.Zhang G. Miyamoto M.M. Cohn M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3180-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The model electron density map was calculated (17.Orgel J.P. Wess T.J. Miller A. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 137-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20.Bradshaw J.P. Miller A. Wess T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using the residue level scattering factors of Hulmes et al. (21.Hulmes D.J. Miller A. White S.W. Doyle B.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 110: 643-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the amino acid sequence described previously, the Hodge-Petruska scheme, and assuming a regular unit height spacing of the molecular helix (residue-to-residue distance). The telopeptides were initially modeled as elongated structures extending straight from the ends of the triple-helical region. After comparison with the difference Patterson and Fourier maps, the telopeptides were modeled as folded structures, similar to that of type I collagen C-telopeptide (although the N-telopeptide is required a double-folded conformation to fit the experimental data; see “Results”). In this study, we took the approach that the gap/overlap ratio is determined by the extents of the telopeptides (17.Orgel J.P. Wess T.J. Miller A. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 137-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and along the lines of the height/depth ratio approach of Bradshaw et al. (20.Bradshaw J.P. Miller A. Wess T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Hence, the overlap start and end points were determined by considering the following points. 1) The position of the iodine peaks for the telopeptides that give the location of the telopeptide ends: the distance from the telopeptide termini to the fold can be estimated from the number of known amino acids spanning the distance. 2) The point of the overlap region above average height versus gap region below average depth: the low resolution of the study means that the influence of the first few orders (particularly the first) produces a tail effect that makes the overlap appear larger than it is. This was partly countered through the calculation of the native electron density map with the amplitude of the first order reduced ten times (supplemental Fig. 3). 3) The model parameters that fit the difference Fourier heavy atom positions and the difference Patterson peak separation values and that best fit the native electron density, provided there is compliance with points 1 and 2. 4) Examination of the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of type II fibrils to confirm that the values determined from points 1–3 were reasonable: we hold that the x-ray data are the most accurate approach due to the use of native samples and better resolution and due to the multiple lines of approach used to reach the gap/overlap estimate. Collagen type II fibrils were studied at the University of Chicago Electron Microscopy Center. Images were examined under 300 kV using an FEI Tecnai F30 microscope with a Gatan CCD digital micrograph (4k × 4k) as detector. Sample preparation was the same as for the diffraction experiments, followed by fixation, embedding, and sectioning into 90-nm sections on a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E microtome. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate to enhance the image contrast. We found that suspensions greatly enhanced the clarity of the human type II collagen fibrils. For these preparations, cartilaginous tissues were homogenized in Tris-buffered saline on ice for 1 min to release collagen fibrils and other matrix components. These samples were then placed on grids and stained with uranyl acetate. The D-period from the x-ray structure was confirmed against the TEM data by sampling the gap/overlap ratio in the clearest TEM image (i.e. such as that shown in supplemental Fig. 4F) >10 unit cells. The S.D. was 0.0049, and the percentage error (as measured by the mean discrepancy between the sum of gap and overlap measurements versus the single D-band measurement was <0.05%), arriving at a value of 0.419:0.579D for the gap/overlap. The scale bars showing the gap/overlap and D-band extents were then superimposed on the other TEM images (see “Results”). The extent of folding or compression required of the telopeptides to fit the native electron density map was determined from the difference Patterson and Fourier maps. In addition, structure prediction calculations were performed for the conformation of the telopeptides. Both N and C termini were examined using the Chou-Fasman (29.Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar) and self-optimized prediction method with alignment (30.Geourjon C. Deléage G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1995; 11: 681-684PubMed Google Scholar) structure prediction methods, and the results were compared with the diffraction and electron microscopy data (D-period gap/overlap ratio, position of heavy atom peaks). The results were found to be in agreement; therefore, atomic coordinates of the telopeptides for one α-chain were generated de novo from the amino acid sequence and energy-minimized using NAMD (31.Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13236) Google Scholar) as a further check of the hypothesis that the telopeptides are folded. The molecular surfaces were calculated using “spock” (32.Christopher J.A. Swanson R. Baldwin T.O. Comput. Chem. 1996; 20: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 33.Perumal S. Antipova O. Orgel J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 2824-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 34.Orgel J.P. Eid A. Antipova O. Bella J. Scott J.E. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7028Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with the default options, except the surface polygon parameter, which was set to 120 for improved surface definition. The display option was set to “mesh” to allow the underlying bonds of the model to be seen. The calculated mesh is not an electron density map but simply a rendering of the molecular surface. A medium wide angle diffraction pattern from native (unstained) type II collagen is shown in Fig. 1, with the central section containing the meridional series indicated. Diffraction images from native lamprey notochord and two heavy-atom derivatives were recorded, showing meridional reflections up to the 37th order or ∼18 Å. (Integrated and scaled intensities of orders 1–35 for native samples and derivatives are presented in supplemental Fig. 2.) The amplitudes of the native samples were subtracted from the amplitudes of the derivative samples, and the resulting differences for each order, together with the calculated phases, were used in a reverse Fourier transformation. This operation produces an electron density map, whose peaks correspond to the positions of heavy atoms within the native-like unit cell (the D-period) of the collagen type II fibril. The iodine derivative difference Fourier map is shown in Fig. 2. Although the majority of these heavy atom-binding positions appear to correspond to the expected collagen amino acid residue labeling positions, some appear to have bound isomorphously at an unexpected location (no liable amino acid residues from the collagen sequence), and, given the corresponding native electron density, this may indicate the presence of the small leucine-rich repeat protein, biglycan, or a related small leucine-rich repeat protein at this location. It is known that small leucine-rich repeat proteins are attached to the surface of type II collagen fibrils at ∼0.7–0.8D (see “Discussion”). The presence of tyrosine residues in the telopeptides and telopeptide region, allows the detection of the ends of the telopeptides (difference Fourier, Fig. 2B; and Patterson maps, Fig. 2C and 3D). From these data, it was clear that the telopeptides are highly contracted or folded (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4), a possibility supported by the native electron density map (see below and Fig. 2A). The native electron density map was calculated using reverse Fourier transformation of the experimentally derived structure factors (Fig. 2). This map represents the sum of the five collagen molecular segments in lateral projection (perpendicular to the fiber axis) in the Hodge-Petruska scheme (supplemental Fig. 1) and is a direct function of the axial D-periodic structure of the type II collagen fibril. This map allows deductions to be made concerning the conformation of the collagen molecules, the collagen fibril parameters, and the telopeptide conformations (in conjunction with the heavy atom labeling data). From the one-dimensional electron density map, the overlap is measured to be 0.42D, which is shorter than that of the collagen type I fibril, and the gap is ∼0.58D (Fig. 2). This overlap to gap ratio of 0.42:0.58 is confirmed by the TEM data (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. 4). Compared with type I collagen, these parameters might appear confusing because the type II molecule is four amino acid residues longer than the type I molecule, which would suggest that the overlap to gap ratio should be closer to 1:1 than the type I ratio of 0.46:0.54 (17.Orgel J.P. Wess T.J. Miller A. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 137-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 35.Schmitt F.O. Cecil Hall E. Marie Jakus A. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1942; 20: 11-33Crossref Google Scholar). After considering the difference Patterson and Fourier data, it is reasonable to assume that the shorter collagen type II overlap region is a consequence of the telopeptides adopting a conformation that makes them shorter in linear projection (see supplemental Fig. 3) (17.Orgel J.P. Wess T.J. Miller A. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 137-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The telopeptides would have to be either highly compressed (“contracted”) or tightly turned to fit the measured gap/overlap ratio and difference Fourier and Patterson data. The compressed model does not seem plausible due to peptide bond constraints; compressed telopeptides would require a height translation of ∼0.8 Å to fit within the 0.42D overlap region. To aid the analysis and interpretation of the one-dimensional electron density map, an electron density model of one D-period was calculated from the collagen type II amino acid sequence and the individual whole amino acid residue structure factors (Fig. 2) (21.Hulmes D.J. Miller A. White S.W. Doyle B.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 110: 643-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the model, the collagen molecules are staggered by 234 residues (∼67 nm), and the individual peptide α-chains are staggered by one amino acid residue within each triple-helix segment (17.Orgel J.P. Wess T.J. Miller A. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 137-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 19.Orgel J.P. Irving T.C. Miller A. Wess T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9001-9005Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The initial model assumed a conformation of the telopeptides where they were straight and relaxed (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4 and supplemental Fig. 3). This model provided parameters for the D-period that disagreed with the one-dimensional map obtained from the experimental data (supplemental Fig. 3 and Fig. 2). The model overlap region (0.53D) was longer than the experimentally determined value (0.42D), and the gap region was shorter (theoretical, 0.47D; experimental, 0.58D). Assuming that the telopeptides may form turns, unstructured coils, and relaxed strands (17.Orgel J.P. Wess T.J. Miller A. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 137-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21.Hulmes D.J. Miller A. White S.W. Doyle B.B. J. Mol.

J. 1995; 68: 1661-1670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), their amino acid sequences were examined, and possible conformations were predicted using the Chou-Fasman and self-optimized prediction method with alignment methods (supplemental Tables 1 and 2). Both these methods and the difference Fourier and Patterson data suggested tight turns in the N- and C-telopeptides, which would change the gap/overlap ratio in the model to better fit the experimentally determined values. According to the structure predictions (Fig. 3 and supplemental Table 1), the N-telopeptide can form two turns, one at position Gly-11 to Gly-12 and another at position Gly-4 to Gly-5. The telopeptide section between the triple-helix and the first turn has the greatest propensity to form β-strands. The peptide chains of the triple-helix itself are considered to be in almost a relaxed β-strand conformation, which is close to the polyproline II helical conformation. Given that the telopeptide is directly connected to the triple-helical regions, the N-telopeptide may have some “structural memory” (17.Orgel J.P. Wess T.J. Miller A. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 137-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 37.Yu E.W. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

https://openalex.org/W1974484155,"During mitosis, the stacked structure of the Golgi undergoes a continuous fragmentation process. The generated mitotic fragments are evenly distributed into the daughter cells and reassembled into new Golgi stacks. This disassembly and reassembly process is critical for Golgi biogenesis during cell division, but the underlying molecular mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we have recapitulated this process using an in vitro assay and analyzed the proteins associated with interphase and mitotic Golgi membranes using a proteomic approach. Incubation of purified rat liver Golgi membranes with mitotic HeLa cell cytosol led to fragmentation of the membranes; subsequent treatment of these membranes with interphase cytosol allowed the reassembly of the Golgi fragments into new Golgi stacks. These membranes were then used for quantitative proteomics analyses by combining the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification approach with OFFGEL isoelectric focusing separation and liquid chromatography-matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. In three independent experiments, a total of 1,193 Golgi-associated proteins were identified and quantified. These included broad functional categories, such as Golgi structural proteins, Golgi resident enzymes, SNAREs, Rab GTPases, cargo, and cytoskeletal proteins. More importantly, the combination of the quantitative approach with Western blotting allowed us to unveil 84 proteins with significant changes in abundance under the mitotic condition compared with the interphase condition. Among these proteins, several COPI coatomer subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) are of particular interest. Altogether, this systematic quantitative proteomic study revealed candidate proteins of the molecular machinery that control the Golgi disassembly and reassembly processes in the cell cycle."

IntroductionUracil arises frequently in DNA, both by misincorporation of dUMP instead of dTMP during replication and by spontaneous deamination of cytosine (1.Krokan H.E. Drabl⊘s F. Slupphaug G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8935-8948Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Misincorporated uracil results in U:A pairs that are non-mutagenic but may be cytotoxic (2.Guillet M. Boiteux S. Mol. Cel.l Biol. 2003; 23: 8386-8394Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas deaminated cytosines generate U:G mispairs that cause C:G to T:A transition mutations if not repaired prior to replication (3.Duncan B.K. Miller J.H. Nature. 1980; 287: 560-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, uracil is also a mutagenic intermediate generated by enzymatic cytosine deamination during production of antibody diversity at the Ig loci (4.Kavli B. Otterlei M. Slupphaug G. Krokan H.E. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).Cells minimize dUTP misincorporation by maintaining a low dUTP/dTTP ratio through the enzyme deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP (5.Guillet M. Van Der Kemp P.A. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2056-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Uracil arising in DNA either from misincorporation of dUMP or from deamination of cytosine is actively removed through the multistep base excision repair (BER) 3The abbreviations used are: BERbase excision repairDTTdithiothreitolUDGuracil DNA glycosylaseAtUNGArabidopsis thaliana uracil DNA glycosylase5-FU5-fluorouracilUgiuracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor. pathway (6.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2006Google Scholar). BER of uracil is initiated by a uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) activity that cleaves the N-glycosidic bond and excises uracil as a free base, generating an abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic, AP) site in the DNA. Repair is completed through subsequent steps that include incision at the AP site, gap tailoring, repair synthesis, and ligation (7.Fortini P. Dogliotti E. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 398-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 8.Dianov G.L. Sleeth K.M. Dianova II, Allinson S.L. Mutat. Res. 2003; 531: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).UDGs are distributed across a protein superfamily consisting of five families (6.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2006Google Scholar, 9.Chung J.H. Im E.K. Park H.Y. Kwon J.H. Lee S. Oh J. Hwang K.C. Lee J.H. Jang Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2045-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The first UDG identified was the Ung enzyme from Escherichia coli (10.Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1974; 71: 3649-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), which typifies the ubiquitous Family-1 of UDGs. This highly conserved family is represented in most species analyzed, with some remarkable exceptions such as Drosophila melanogaster and Archaea (11.Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Biol. 2000; 1 (research0007.0001–0007.0008)Crossref Google Scholar). Family-1 enzymes, such as human UNG, recognize uracil in an extrahelical conformation and are active both on dsDNA and ssDNA. Family-2 enzymes, represented by E. coli Mug and human TDG, are mismatch specific, show dsDNA dependence, and contact the opposite G in the complementary strand. Family-3 UDGs are represented by SMUG1 from vertebrates, are active both on dsDNA and ssDNA, and have a broader specificity than family-1 enzymes. UDGs from families 4 and 5 have been identified in thermophilic bacteria and archaea. In addition to the five UDG families, at least three families of the HhH-GPD superfamily of DNA glycosylases (named after its hallmark helix-hairpin-helix and Gly/Pro-rich loop followed by a conserved aspartate) include members with UDG activity (6.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2006Google Scholar, 9.Chung J.H. Im E.K. Park H.Y. Kwon J.H. Lee S. Oh J. Hwang K.C. Lee J.H. Jang Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2045-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).In contrast to the wealth of information available for bacteria, yeast, and mammalian systems, our knowledge about uracil excision repair in plants remains very limited. UDG activity has been detected and partially purified from several plant species, including carrot, wheat, onion, and maize (12.Talpaert-Borlè M. Liuzzi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 13.Blaisdell P. Warner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1603-1609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Gutierrez C.

Plant. 1993; 88: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, the proteins responsible for uracil excision in plants have not been identified, and their roles in plant physiology remain unknown.In this work we aimed to identify and characterize the molecular basis of uracil excision repair in Arabidopsis through genetic and biochemical analysis. We report that AtUNG, a member of the Family-1 UDGs, is the major UDG activity in Arabidopsis cell extracts and is absolutely required for initiation of BER of uracil in vitro. We also found that Arabidopsis mutants lacking AtUNG activity are phenotypically normal but display increased resistance to a compound that increases dUMP incorporation into DNA.DISCUSSIONWe report here the isolation and functional characterization of AtUNG, a plant DNA repair enzyme belonging to the Family-1 of UDGs. AtUNG displays a high degree of sequence similarity to E. coli Ung and its homologues. As other eukaryotic UDGs, AtUNG is longer on its N terminus than its prokaryotic counterparts. Extra N- and/or C-terminal regions are common in the eukaryotic homologues of many DNA repair proteins, and they are frequently involved in interactions with other proteins, as well as in targeting to subcellular compartments (28.Izumi T. Wiederhold L.R. Roy G. Roy R. Jaiswal A. Bhakat K.K. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. Toxicology. 2003; 193: 43-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 29.Fan J. Wilson III, D.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 1121-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In human cells, alternative transcription initiation and splicing generate different N-terminal sequences that mediate targeting of the nuclear (UNG2) and mitochondrial (UNG1) isoforms of the protein (30.Nilsen H. Otterlei M. Haug T. Solum K. Nagelhus T.A. Skorpen F. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Because we have not found evidence of multiple AtUNG transcripts diverging in the 5′ region (data not shown), isoforms analogous to UNG1 or UNG2 may not exist in Arabidopsis. The N-terminal sequence of AtUNG is more similar to human UNG2 than to UNG1 and also contains a putative PCNA-binding motif (PKTLYSFF, present at amino acids 6–13 of the AtUNG polypeptide). This suggests that, similarly to the human nuclear isoform, AtUNG might have a role in rapid postreplicative removal of misincorporated dUMP at the replication fork in the nucleus (31.Otterlei M. Warbrick E. Nagelhus T.A. Haug T. Slupphaug G. Akbari M. Aas P.A. Steinsbekk K. Bakke O. Krokan H.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3834-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, the possibility that AtUNG is also targeted to mitochondria and/or chloroplasts cannot be ruled out. Protein localization studies will be needed to assess whether AtUNG is targeted to more than one subcellular compartment.Like other members of the Family-1 of UDGs, AtUNG has a rather narrow substrate specificity. Out of seven different pyrimidine derivatives, we only observed detectable excision on uracil. In contrast, E. coli Ung excised both U and 5-FU, a property shared with human UNG (1.Krokan H.E. Drabl⊘s F. Slupphaug G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8935-8948Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The lack of AtUNG activity on 5-FU, when compared with bacterial and human enzymes, suggests that the steric constraints that impose selectivity and specificity for uracil against other pyrimidines may be more rigid in the plant enzyme than in other homologs.We have found evidence indicating that AtUNG encodes the UDG activity detected in Arabidopsis cell extracts. Thus, UDG activity from extracts displays the same narrow substrate specificity as purified AtUNG, is also completely inhibited by Ugi, and is not present in extracts obtained from atung−/− plants. In addition, we have found that atung−/− extracts retain full capacity to repair AP sites but lack the ability to initiate BER of U. Altogether, these results suggest that AtUNG may be the major UDG activity responsible for initiating BER of uracil residues in Arabidopsis. A survey of the Arabidopsis genome does not reveal any other identifiable member of some UDG family. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional plant proteins with UDG activity exist, and that they are not represented in our cell extracts and/or not detectable under our assay conditions.Despite the absence of detectable UDG activity and the lack of BER of uracil residues, no phenotypic effects were evident in AtUNG-deficient mutant plants. A similar absence of phenotypic alterations has been reported for Ung-null mutants from other multicellular organisms. For instance, mice with targeted disruption of the UNG gene are developmentally normal and fertile, and have no obvious phenotype (32.Nilsen H. Rosewell I. Robins P. Skjelbred C.F. Andersen S. Slupphaug G. Daly G. Krokan H.E. Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Development, fertility and lifespan are also unaffected in ung-1-null mutants from C. elegans (33.Nakamura N. Morinaga H. Kikuchi M. Yonekura S. Ishii N. Yamamoto K. Yonei S. Zhang Q.M. Mutagenesis. 2008; 23: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cell extracts from UNG-deficient mice retain a significant UDG activity (32.Nilsen H. Rosewell I. Robins P. Skjelbred C.F.

Cell. 2000; 5: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), later identified as SMUG1 (34.Nilsen H. Haushalter K.A. Robins P. Barnes D.E. Verdine G.L. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In contrast, no residual uracil excision is detected in C. elegans ung-1 mutants and there are no obvious candidates for any possible backup enzymes encoded in the worm genome (33.Nakamura N. Morinaga H. Kikuchi M. Yonekura S. Ishii N. Yamamoto K. Yonei S. Zhang Q.M. Mutagenesis. 2008; 23: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).We have found that atung−/− mutants are less sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of 5-FU than wild-type plants, but at the expense of uracil accumulation in their genome. These results strongly suggest that AtUNG excises uracil in vivo, but also indicate that this activity is detrimental for the plant when the dUTP/dTTP ratio is artificially increased by 5-FU treatment. It has been reported that deletion of the Ung gene protects yeast cells against 5-FU (35.Seiple L. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Stivers J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These results support the hypothesis that futile cycles of uracil BER burdened by a depleted dTTP pool, with the ensuing accumulation of toxic DNA repair intermediates, may explain part of the cytotoxic effects of 5-FU, at least in plants and yeasts.We did not detect increased levels of uracil in the genome of untreated atung−/− mutants. It has been reported that dividing cells from UNG-deficient mice have increased levels of uracil (32.Nilsen H. Rosewell I. Robins P. Skjelbred C.F. Andersen S. Slupphaug G. Daly G. Krokan H.E. Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, the amounts of accumulated uracil are low in tissues with low turnover rates, thus suggesting that spontaneous uracil residues in the genome originate predominantly from dUMP misincorporation during replication, rather than cytosine deamination (36.Andersen S. Heine T. Sneve R. König I. Krokan H.E. Epe B. Nilsen H. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is possible that uracil accumulation in untreated atung−/− plants is efficiently prevented by mechanisms that counteract dUMP misincorporation, and/or that the steady-state level reached is below the detection limit of the assay method used here. IntroductionUracil arises frequently in DNA, both by misincorporation of dUMP instead of dTMP during replication and by spontaneous deamination of cytosine (1.Krokan H.E. Drabl⊘s F. Slupphaug G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8935-8948Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Misincorporated uracil results in U:A pairs that are non-mutagenic but may be cytotoxic (2.Guillet M. Boiteux S. Mol. Cel.l Biol. 2003; 23: 8386-8394Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas deaminated cytosines generate U:G mispairs that cause C:G to T:A transition mutations if not repaired prior to replication (3.Duncan B.K. Miller J.H. Nature. 1980; 287: 560-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, uracil is also a mutagenic intermediate generated by enzymatic cytosine deamination during production of antibody diversity at the Ig loci (4.Kavli B. Otterlei M. Slupphaug G. Krokan H.E. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).Cells minimize dUTP misincorporation by maintaining a low dUTP/dTTP ratio through the enzyme deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP (5.Guillet M. Van Der Kemp P.A. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2056-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Uracil arising in DNA either from misincorporation of dUMP or from deamination of cytosine is actively removed through the multistep base excision repair (BER) 3The abbreviations used are: BERbase excision repairDTTdithiothreitolUDGuracil DNA glycosylaseAtUNGArabidopsis thaliana uracil DNA glycosylase5-FU5-fluorouracilUgiuracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor. pathway (6.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2006Google Scholar). BER of uracil is initiated by a uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) activity that cleaves the N-glycosidic bond and excises uracil as a free base, generating an abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic, AP) site in the DNA. Repair is completed through subsequent steps that include incision at the AP site, gap tailoring, repair synthesis, and ligation (7.Fortini P. Dogliotti E. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 398-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 8.Dianov G.L. Sleeth K.M. Dianova II, Allinson S.L. Mutat. Res. 2003; 531: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).UDGs are distributed across a protein superfamily consisting of five families (6.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2006Google Scholar, 9.Chung J.H. Im E.K. Park H.Y. Kwon J.H. Lee S. Oh J. Hwang K.C. Lee J.H. Jang Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2045-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The first UDG identified was the Ung enzyme from Escherichia coli (10.Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1974; 71: 3649-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), which typifies the ubiquitous Family-1 of UDGs. This highly conserved family is represented in most species analyzed, with some remarkable exceptions such as Drosophila melanogaster and Archaea (11.Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Biol. 2000; 1 (research0007.0001–0007.0008)Crossref Google Scholar). Family-1 enzymes, such as human UNG, recognize uracil in an extrahelical conformation and are active both on dsDNA and ssDNA. Family-2 enzymes, represented by E. coli Mug and human TDG, are mismatch specific, show dsDNA dependence, and contact the opposite G in the complementary strand. Family-3 UDGs are represented by SMUG1 from vertebrates, are active both on dsDNA and ssDNA, and have a broader specificity than family-1 enzymes. UDGs from families 4 and 5 have been identified in thermophilic bacteria and archaea. In addition to the five UDG families, at least three families of the HhH-GPD superfamily of DNA glycosylases (named after its hallmark helix-hairpin-helix and Gly/Pro-rich loop followed by a conserved aspartate) include members with UDG activity (6.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2006Google Scholar, 9.Chung J.H. Im E.K. Park H.Y. Kwon J.H. Lee S. Oh J. Hwang K.C. Lee J.H. Jang Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2045-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).In contrast to the wealth of information available for bacteria, yeast, and mammalian systems, our knowledge about uracil excision repair in plants remains very limited. UDG activity has been detected and partially purified from several plant species, including carrot, wheat, onion, and maize (12.Talpaert-Borlè M. Liuzzi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 13.Blaisdell P. Warner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1603-1609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Gutierrez C.

However, the proteins responsible for uracil excision in plants have not been identified, and their roles in plant physiology remain unknown.In this work we aimed to identify and characterize the molecular basis of uracil excision repair in Arabidopsis through genetic and biochemical analysis. We report that AtUNG, a member of the Family-1 UDGs, is the major UDG activity in Arabidopsis cell extracts and is absolutely required for initiation of BER of uracil in vitro. We also found that Arabidopsis mutants lacking AtUNG activity are phenotypically normal but display increased resistance to a compound that increases dUMP incorporation into DNA."

A window current at typical resting potentials appears to be at least as large as that reported for mammalian channels. This distant gene provides a unique perspective to analyze the structural, functional, drug binding, and evolutionary aspects of T-type channels."

Intestinal epithelial cells, primarily thought to form a simple physical barrier, critically regulate intestinal immune cell functions by producing immunoregu-latory glucocorticoids on T-cell activation. In this study we investigated whether stimulation of cells of the innate immune system results in the induction of intestinal glucocorticoids synthesis and what role TNF-α plays in this process. Stimulation of the innate immune system with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) led to an up-regulation of colonic steroidogenic enzymes and the induction of intestinal glucocorticoid synthesis. The observed induction was dependent on macrophage effector functions, as depletion of macrophages using clodronate-containing liposomes, but not absence of T and B cells, inhibited intestinal glucocorticoid synthesis. LPS-induced glucocorticoid synthesis was critically dependent on TNF-α as it was significantly decreased in TNF-α-deficient animals. Both TNF receptor-1 and -2 were found to be equally involved in LPS- and T-cell-induced intestinal GC synthesis. These results describe a novel and critical role of TNF-α in immune cell-induced intestinal glucocorticoid synthesis.—Noti, M., Corazza, N., Tuffin, G., Schoonjans, K., Brunner, T.

We examined whether pulmonary collectins play protective roles against L. pneumophila infection. SP-A and SP-D bound to L. pneumophila and its lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and inhibited the bacterial growth in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The addition of LPS in the culture blocked the inhibitory effects on L. pneumophila growth by the collectins, indicating the importance of LPS-collectin interaction. When differentiated THP-1 cells were infected with L. pneumophila in the presence of SP-A and SP-D, the number of permeable cells was significantly decreased, indicating that pulmonary collectins inhibit pore-forming activity of L. pneumophila. The number of live bacteria within the macrophages on days 1–4 after infection was significantly decreased when infection was performed in the presence of pulmonary collectins. The phagocytosis experiments with the pH-sensitive dye-labeled bacteria revealed that pulmonary collectins promoted bacterial localization to an acidic compartment. In addition, SP-A and SP-D significantly increased the number of L. pneumophila co-localized with LAMP-1.

https://openalex.org/W2000078796,"Matrix metalloproteinase activity is essential for proper extracellular matrix remodeling that takes place during adipose tissue formation. Four tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) regulate their activity. However, the role of TIMPs in adipocyte differentiation is poorly understood. We found that the expression of all TIMPs was modified during adipocyte differentiation, but that of TIMP-3 was distinguished by its extreme down-regulation. TIMP-3 expression was closely linked to the differentiation process. Indeed, it remained low during the adipocyte differentiation but increased when cell differentiation was prevented. We identified the transcription factor Sp1 as being responsible for the regulation of TIMP-3 expression during adipocyte differentiation. Overexpression of TIMP-3 reduced adipocyte differentiation, underlining its active role in this process. TIMP-3 overexpression decreased the expression of the early and obligate key inductors of adipogenesis Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), early growth response 2 (Egr2/Krox20), and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta).

We find that Irgm1/LRG-47 is a significant factor in the progression of EAE and multiple sclerosis (MS). Expression of Irgm1 was robustly elevated in MS-affected lesions and in the central nervous system (CNS) of myelin basic protein (MBP)-induced EAE mice, especially in cells of lymphoid and mononuclear phagocyte origin. Homozygous Irgm1 null mice were resistant to MBP-induced EAE, and CD4+ T cells in spleen and CNS of these mice displayed decreased proliferative capacity, increased apoptosis, and up-regulated interferon (IFN)-γ induction. Therefore, Irgm1-induced survival of autoreactive CD4+ T cells contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of EAE.

https://openalex.org/W1966346924,"DNA packaging in tailed bacteriophages and other viruses requires assembly of a complex molecular machine at a specific vertex of the procapsid. This machine is composed of the portal protein that provides a tunnel for DNA entry, an ATPase that fuels DNA translocation (large terminase subunit), and most frequently, a small terminase subunit. Here we characterized the interaction between the terminase ATPase subunit of bacteriophage SPP1 (gp2) and the procapsid portal vertex. We found, by affinity pulldown assays with purified proteins, that gp2 interacts with the portal protein, gp6, independently of the terminase small subunit gp1, DNA, or ATP. The gp2-procapsid interaction via the portal protein depends on gp2 concentration and requires the presence of divalent cations. Competition experiments showed that isolated gp6 can only inhibit gp2-procapsid interactions and DNA packaging at gp6:procapsid molar ratios above 10-fold. Assays with gp6 carrying mutations in distinct regions of its structure that affect the portal-induced stimulation of ATPase and DNA packaging revealed that none of these mutations impedes gp2-gp6 binding. Our results demonstrate that the SPP1 packaging ATPase binds directly to the portal and that the interaction is stronger with the portal embedded in procapsids. Identification of mutations in gp6 that allow for assembly of the ATPase-portal complex but impair DNA packaging support an intricate cross-talk between the two proteins for activity of the DNA translocation motor."

During mitosis, the centrosomes nucleate the bipolar mitotic spindle, which is essential for ensuring fidelity of chromosome segregation. They also contribute to cell cycle regulation, as components of the anaphase-promoting complex (3.King R.W. Peters J.M. Tugendreich S. Rolfe M. Hieter P. Kirschner M.W.

In addition, centrosomes are important for determining the position of the cleavage furrow and for cytokinesis (1.Kellogg D.R. Moritz M. Alberts B.M. Annu. Rev.

Science. 2001; 291: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar).Understandably, the process of centrosome replication is very tightly regulated to ensure that replication occurs only once during the cell cycle and is coordinated with DNA replication. After replication, the duplicated centrosomes separate and undergo maturation that involves dynamic re-organization of the pericentriolar material (PCM) and increase in size and MT nucleating ability. Several protein kinases, including polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), aurora kinase (aurora-A), and Nek2, have been implicated in these processes (12.Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 13.Mayor T. Meraldi P. Stierhof Y.D. Nigg E.A. Fry A.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Centrosomes consist of a core of centrioles surrounded by amorphous PCM that contains a variety of proteins vital for MT nucleation (14.Gould R.R. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 73: 601-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) including γ-tubulin (15.Stearns T. Evans L. Kirschner M. Cell. 1991; 65: 825-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). γ-Tubulin is a highly conserved centrosomal protein that forms ring-like structures in association with other proteins in the PCM that serves as a template for MT nucleation (16.Stearns T. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 623-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 17.Zheng Y. Wong M.L. Alberts B. Mitchison T. Nature. 1995; 378: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Pericentrin is another well characterized pericentrosomal protein that forms a 3-MDa complex with γ-tubulin, which can assemble into lattice-like structures in the PCM and provide additional platforms for MT nucleation (18.Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 19.Dictenberg J.B. Zimmerman W. Sparks C.A. Young A. Vidair C. Zheng Y. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Pericentrin aids in anchoring the γ-tubulin ring complex to the mitotic spindle during metaphase and is essential for proper assembly of the mitotic spindle (20.Zimmerman W.C. Sillibourne J. Rosa J. Doxsey S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3642-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, besides MT nucleation, γ-tubulin and pericentrin are also critical for centrosome structure and assembly and correct mitotic spindle formation (18.Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 21.Félix M.A. Antony C. Wright M. Maro B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).Non-visual arrestins (arrestin2 and -3, also known as β-arrestin1 and -2) belong to a family of proteins that was initially identified as regulators of G protein-coupled receptor signaling (22.Benovic J.L. Kühn H. Weyand I. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 8879-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). They are ubiquitously expressed and specifically bind to agonist-activated, phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors. Arrestin binding terminates G protein signaling by physically uncoupling the receptor from the heterotrimeric G protein (23.Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18125-18131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Since their discovery, arrestins have been shown to promote receptor internalization (24.Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L.

Physiol. 2007; 69: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Additional studies have demonstrated that arrestins can also translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene transcription (27.Kang J. Shi Y. Xiang B. Qu B. Su W. Zhu M. Zhang M. Bao G. Wang F. Zhang X. Yang R. Fan F. Chen X. Pei G. Ma L. Cell. 2005; 123: 833-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 28.Neuhaus E.M. Mashukova A. Barbour J. Wolters D. Hatt H. J.

Despite high homology, the two non-visual arrestins differ in their ability to bind various proteins (30.Xiao K. McClatchy D.B. Shukla A.K. Zhao Y. Chen M. Shenoy S.K. Yates 3rd, J.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 12011-12016Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and regulate different classes of receptors (31.Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Interestingly, their intracellular localization is also considerably different with GFP-tagged arrestin2 being diffuse in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, whereas arrestin3-GFP is strictly cytoplasmic (31.Oakley R.H.

The reason for this differential pattern of distribution is attributed to the presence of a leucine-rich nuclear export signal in the C-terminal region of arrestin3. It is worth noting that the majority of studies have overexpressed tagged versions of arrestin2 or -3 to visualize their co-localization with other cellular proteins and receptors or translocation to different intracellular compartments (27.Kang J. Shi Y. Xiang B. Qu B. Su W. Zhu M. Zhang M. Bao G. Wang F. Zhang X. Yang R. Fan F. Chen X. Pei G. Ma L.

We found that both arrestins co-localize with the centrosome at every stage of the cell cycle, independent of MTs. Both arrestins co-fractionate with γ-tubulin in centrosome-rich fractions and directly interact with purified γ-tubulin. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous arrestins produced multinucleated cells and abnormal centrosome number, size, and function that could be rescued by arrestin overexpression. Our data suggest that loss of arrestin triggers centrosome hypertrophy concomitant with aberrant MT re-growth, resulting in chromosome segregation errors and ultimately producing cells with multiple nuclei. These findings shed new light on arrestins as regulators of normal centrosomal function.DISCUSSIONThis study was undertaken to examine the intracellular localization and function of endogenous arrestins. We provide evidence for the localization and functional role for arrestins in the centrosome. Using confocal microscopy, we have shown co-localization of endogenous arrestins with different centrosomal markers (γ-tubulin, pericentrin, and centrin) in multiple cell lines. In addition, we have shown that arrestins are enriched in purified centrosome fractions and can directly interact with γ-tubulin in each and every phase of the cell cycle. Therefore, we conclude that arrestin2 and -3 are constitutively associated with the centrosome.We have also analyzed the functional role of the arrestins by suppressing the expression of arrestin2 or -3 using specific siRNAs. Loss of arrestin2 or -3 produced a significant increase in the number of cells with multiple nuclei, centrioles, and centrosomes. Importantly, expression of wild type arrestin2 or -3 in arrestin-depleted cells rescued the multinucleate and centrosome amplification defects, verifying their role in normal centrosome function. It is worth noting that greater rescue was observed with arrestin2 overexpression as compared with arrestin3 in HEK293 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Loss of arrestin2 also produced a significant increase in abnormally large centrosomes. We envision that in arrestin2 knockdown cells, some of the amplified centrosomes either undergo fusion and form unusually large centrosomes or there is excess PCM associated with each centrosome. Reduction in arrestin2 expression also generated hyperactive centrosomes as arrestin2-siRNA-transfected cells nucleated larger MT asters. Therefore, our results support a more critical role for arrestin2 in centrosome function, although arrestin3 is also important.In a recently published study, it was reported that arrestin3 but not arrestin2 co-localizes with the centrosome in HeLa cells (56.Molla-Herman A. Boularan C. Ghossoub R. Scott M.G. Burtey A. Zarka M. Saunier S. Concordet J.P. Marullo S. Benmerah A. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, this previous study did not note any increase in multinucleated cells or any defect in MT re-growth after release from the nocodazole block in arrestin3-deficient MEFs. Thus, the authors concluded that arrestin3 does not contribute to any of the classical centrosome functions. We believe that in the Molla-Herman et al. study (56.Molla-Herman A. Boularan C. Ghossoub R. Scott M.G. Burtey A. Zarka M. Saunier S. Concordet J.P. Marullo S. Benmerah A. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the high background in their arrestin2-GFP-expressing cells could have made it difficult to discern the presence of arrestin2 in the centrosome. In our experiments we observed that both non-visual arrestins are core components of the centrosome in multiple cell lines including MEFs. Interestingly, another study demonstrated that both arrestin2 and -3 co-localize with the cilia, where they regulate hedgehog signaling (57.Kovacs J.J. Whalen E.J. Liu R. Xiao K. Kim J. Chen M. Wang J. Chen W. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2008; 320: 1777-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Specifically, it was reported that endogenous non-visual arrestins co-localize with pericentrin in the basal body of the cilia, in agreement with our observations that both arrestins co-localize with pericentrin in the centrosome.Because arrestins have been shown to associate with MTs (41.Hanson S.M. Cleghorn W.M. Francis D.J. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Raman D. Song X. Nair K.S. Slepak V.Z. Klug C.S. Gurevich V.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether endogenous arrestins required MTs for centrosome localization and function. Because pretreatment of cells with nocodazole to disrupt MTs did not alter arrestin localization in the centrosome, this localization appears to be independent of MTs. Although we believe that arrestin association with MTs does not contribute to the centrosomal defects observed in cells with reduced arrestin expression, a possible role for this interaction in centrosomal function cannot be excluded.There are several possible mechanisms by which non-visual arrestins could modulate their effect on centrosome number and function. First, this could be mediated by the scaffolding functions of arrestins. Indeed, many studies have demonstrated that arrestins can form complexes with multiple cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, which is essential for their ability to regulate different cellular responses. We have demonstrated that arrestin2 and -3 can directly interact with γ-tubulin, and we believe that this represents a mechanism contributing to arrestin localization in the centrosome. Binding to γ-tubulin might enable arrestins to associate with other centrosomal proteins. Two other centrosomal proteins, BRCA1 and PLK1, have also been shown to associate with γ-, α-, and β-tubulins (40.Starita L.M. Machida Y. Sankaran S. Elias J.E. Griffin K. Schlegel B.P. Gygi S.P. Parvin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8457-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 58.Feng Y. Hodge D.R. Palmieri G. Chase D.L. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. Biochem.

Interestingly, knockdown of arrestin expression displays many of the functional centrosome defects noted after loss of BRCA1 or overexpression of PLK1, including multinucleation, centriole and centrosome amplification (42.Mundt K.E.

Biol. 2005; 25: 8656-8668Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that arrestins, similar to BRCA1, might be involved in the negative regulation of centrosome activity and help to prevent inappropriate centrosome duplication. Therefore, γ-tubulin, BRCA1, PLK1, arrestin2, and arrestin3 could exist as a complex in the centrosome, and altering the expression of any of these proteins may lead to disruption of the complex, resulting in deleterious consequences. In addition, arrestin2 and -3 can also form hetero-oligomers (64.Milano S.K. Kim Y.M. Stefano F.P. Benovic J.L. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9812-9823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), providing a possible explanation for the lack of compensation by arrestin2 or -3 when the expression of either protein is selectively diminished. Conceptually, this might suggest that multiple proteins need to act in concert to ensure proper functioning of this organelle.Our findings and other published studies show that in addition to non-visual arrestins, other regulators of G protein-coupled receptors are also localized in the centrosome. For example, the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (65.Gillies L. Lee S.C. Long J.S. Ktistakis N. Pyne N.J. Pyne S. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), Gαi (66.Cho H. Kehrl J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), Gβγ, and RGS14 (55.Cho H. Kim D.U. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have been shown to co-localize with γ-tubulin and/or pericentrin. Moreover, fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments reveal that Gαi1 directly interacts with RGS14 in the centrosome, and its normal expression and function is essential for proper cytokinesis (66.Cho H. Kehrl J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Indeed, silencing Gαi or RGS14 expression produced cells with multiple nuclei (55.Cho H. Kim D.U. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), mirroring the defects observed after loss of arrestin2 or -3 expression.Previous studies revealed that reduced arrestin2 expression led to an increase in the number of cells in G1 phase, whereas overexpression of arrestin3 led to a G2/M arrest (34.Boularan C. Scott M.G. Bourougaa K. Bellal M. Esteve E. Thuret A. Benmerah A. Tramier M. Coppey-Moisan M. Labbé-Jullié C. Fåhraeus R. Marullo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 2007; 282: 11329-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in cell cycle progression. Moreover, although a reduction in arrestin3 levels triggered uncontrolled proliferation by positively regulating ciliagenesis (58.Feng Y. Hodge D.R. Palmieri G. Chase D.L. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), loss of arrestin3 in PC12 cells impaired nerve growth factor-induced growth arrest. Similarly, inhibition or loss of many centrosome-associated proteins or the removal of the centrosome induces arrest at G1-S (11.Hinchcliffe E.H. Miller F.J. Cham M. Khodjakov A. Sluder G. Science. 2001; 291: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 51.Gromley A. Jurczyk A. Sillibourne J. Halilovic E. Mogensen M. Groisman I. Blomberg M. Doxsey S. J.

Rieder C.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These findings led to the speculation that the centrosome is required for the G1-S transition, and in its absence the checkpoint system is activated. Thus, it is likely that arrestins could regulate the cell cycle via their localization in the centrosome, and altered cell cycle progression could be responsible for the multinucleate phenotype observed in arrestin knockdown cells. In summary, we provide evidence that arrestin2 and -3 are constitutively associated with the centrosome and positively regulate centrosomal function. These observations suggest that arrestins regulate different aspects of cell cycle progression, thus implicating a novel role for the arrestins as possible suppressors of tumorigenesis.

Cell. 1991; 65: 825-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). γ-Tubulin is a highly conserved centrosomal protein that forms ring-like structures in association with other proteins in the PCM that serves as a template for MT nucleation (16.Stearns T.

Pericentrin is another well characterized pericentrosomal protein that forms a 3-MDa complex with γ-tubulin, which can assemble into lattice-like structures in the PCM and provide additional platforms for MT nucleation (18.Doxsey S.J.

Previous evidence indicates that Plasmodium ookinete-secreted chitinase is important in midgut invasion. The mechanistic role of other ookinete-secreted enzymes in midgut invasion has not been previously examined. De novo mass spectrometry sequencing of a protein obtained by benzamidine affinity column of Plasmodium gallinaceum ookinete axenic culture supernatant demonstrated the presence of an ookinete-secreted plasmepsin, an aspartic protease previously only known to be present in the digestive vacuole of asexual stage malaria parasites.

PgPM4 and PgCHT2 (the P. gallinaceum ortholog of P. falciparum chitinase PfCHT1) are both localized on the ookinete apical surface, and both are present in micronemes. Aspartic protease inhibitors (peptidomimetic and natural product), calpain inhibitors, and anti-PgPM4 monoclonal antibodies significantly reduced parasite infectivity for mosquitoes. These results suggest that plasmepsin 4, previously known only to function in the digestive vacuole of asexual blood stage Plasmodium, plays a role in how the ookinete interacts with the mosquito midgut interactions as it becomes an oocyst.

IntroductionMalaria is the most important parasitic disease of man and a globally dominant cause of morbidity and mortality in humans (1.Sachs J. Malaney P. Nature. 2002; 415: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). The lack of an effective vaccine, the emergence of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, and insecticide-resistant vector mosquitoes all contribute to the increasing human toll of malaria. Malaria is transmitted through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. Preventing transmission from the human reservoir to the definitive host, the mosquito, is one approach to malaria control (2.Malkin E.M. Durbin A.P. Diemert D.J. Sattabongkot J. Wu Y. Miura K. Long C.A. Lambert L. Miles A.P. Wang J. Stowers A. Miller L.H. Saul A. Vaccine. 2005; 23: 3131-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Delineating the mechanisms by which the malaria parasite invades and infects mosquitoes may lead to new strategies to block malaria transmission (3.Carter R. Mendis K.N. Miller L.H. Molineaux L. Saul A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4.Vinetz J.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 295: 357-382PubMed Google Scholar).After a mosquito ingests infectious Plasmodium gametocytes, male and female gametes emerge in the midgut and rapidly fuse to form diploid zygotes. Parasites must then develop into motile ookinetes, penetrate and traverse the protein- and chitin-containing peritrophic matrix, and then cross the midgut epithelium to form oocysts (4.Vinetz J.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 295: 357-382PubMed Google Scholar). Developmentally regulated antigens of these stages are potential targets of antibodies induced by vaccination of the vertebrate host that are co-ingested with parasites as a mosquito takes a blood meal (5.Kaslow D.C. Chem. Immunol. 2002; 80: 287-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Such antibodies are called transmission-blocking antibodies, which act by interfering with parasite development within the mosquito midgut, thus preventing parasite transmission to the mosquito vector. Importantly, proteins expressed in the mosquito stages are less likely to be mutated in response to human immunological responses (6.Saul A. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2007; 20: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Hence, interfering in this part of the life cycle has the potential to reduce both transmission as well as the spread of drug-resistant parasites.Ookinete-expressed proteases have been proposed to play vital roles in ookinete invasion of peritrophic matrix and mosquito midgut (7.Langer R.C. Li F. Vinetz J.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8.Li F. Templeton T.J. Popov V. Comer J.E. Tsuboi T. Torii M. Vinetz J.M. J. Biol.

The peritrophic matrix is the first physical barrier faced by the ookinete as it escapes the blood meal. The peritrophic matrix is composed of proteins, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and chitin (10.Shen Z. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17665-17670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 11.Moskalyk L.A. Oo M.M. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Mol. Biol. 1996; 5: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Proteins, including chitin cross-linking proteins (peritrophins), have been reported to account for 22–55% of the total mass of the peritrophic matrix (10.Shen Z. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17665-17670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 11.Moskalyk L.A. Oo M.M. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Mol. Biol. 1996; 5: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Specific protease inhibitors added to infectious blood meals have been observed to reduce ookinete infectivity for the mosquito (12.Shahabuddin M. Criscio M. Kaslow D.C. Exp. Parasit. 1995; 80: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that ookinetes could use proteases to cross the midgut peritrophic matrix.The genome of P. falciparum encodes a large variety of proteases, including a diverse family of 10 aspartic proteases (designated plasmepsins) (13.Coombs G.H. Goldberg D.E. Klemba M. Berry C. Kay J. Mottram J.C. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Four plasmepsins are known to degrade hemoglobin in the digestive vacuole of asexual stage malaria parasites (14.Banerjee R. Liu J. Beatty W. Pelosof L. Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Functions of the remaining six plasmepsins have not been determined, although gene expression profiling and comprehensive proteomic analysis have demonstrated the presence of several plasmepsins in the sexual stage forms of P. falciparum, Plasmodium berghei, and Plasmodium yoelii (16.Hall N.

No role for any plasmepsin has been demonstrated in Plasmodium-mosquito interactions.In this study, we demonstrate that the P. gallinaceum plasmepsin 4 (PgPM4) 2The abbreviations used are: PgPM4P. gallinaceum plasmepsin 4IFAindirect immunofluorescence assaymAbmonoclonal antibodyALLNcalpain inhibitor I (sequence N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO)ALLMcalpain inhibitor II (sequence N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met-CHO)PBSphosphate-buffered salineHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidrPgPM4recombinant PgPM4. synergizes with the P. gallinaceum chitinase PgCHT2 (the ortholog of the P. falciparum chitinase (18.Li F.

These data are the first to indicate a specific mechanistic function for a plasmepsin in any stage of the malaria parasite other than the asexual blood stage. This aspartic protease plays an important role in ookinete invasion of the mosquito midgut and/or parasite development, and thus may be a novel target of blocking malaria transmission.DISCUSSIONHere, we demonstrate that the Plasmodium ookinete-expressed plasmepsin, PgPM4, plays a role in parasite invasion of the mosquito midgut and is involved somewhere along the pathway along which ookinetes develop into oocysts. These observations are the first to demonstrate, at the protein level, the role of a plasmepsin expressed by the mosquito midgut stages of the malaria parasite, although gene expression and proteomic profiling have shown the presence of plasmepsin gene products in the sexual stages (16.Hall N. Karras M. Raine J.D. Carlton J.M. Kooij T.W. Berriman M. Florens L. Janssen C.S. Pain A. Christophides G.K. James K. Rutherford K. Harris B. Harris D. Churcher C. Quail M.A. Ormond D. Doggett J.

Parasitol. 2005; 143: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In the avian-infecting malaria parasite P. gallinaceum, both PgPM4 and the chitinase PgCHT2 are present in micronemes, consistent with their roles as secreted proteins, and both proteins are present on the apical surface of the ookinete. Collectively, these observations suggest the possibility that both chitinase and PgPM4 are involved in penetrating the chitin- and peritrophin-containing peritrophic matrix. Alternatively, PgPM4 might have additional protease functions involved in parasite-mosquito midgut interactions other than at the level of the peritrophic matrix, such as crossing the epithelial surface or cleaving other parasite or mosquito protein targets. Further experiments are needed to distinguish among these possibilities.The biological importance of plasmepsin 4 was demonstrated in experimental mosquito infections using membrane feeding experiments that incorporated plasmepsin inhibitors and anti-plasmepsin 4 monoclonal antibodies into the infectious blood meal. The data from these experiments provided further evidence of the importance of plasmepsin 4 in parasite-mosquito interactions and strongly suggested its role as a potential target of new transmission blocking strategies.In the process of midgut invasion, the ookinete must cross a series of physical barriers, the first of which is the chitin- and peritrophin-containing peritrophic matrix, followed by the epithelial surface. A series of ookinete-expressed proteins have been reported to be critical for host cell recognition, binding, and motility and have been involved in passage of the ookinete through the mosquito midgut (8.Li F.

Parasitol. 2003; 130: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) have previously only been reported to be present in blood stage parasites. These proteases, localized to the digestive vacuole of the asexual blood stage parasites, participate in the metabolism of hemoglobin and perform other lysosomal functions (14.Banerjee R. Liu J.

Microbiol. 2007; 65: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our data, based upon experiments of an avian model of malaria transmission, P. gallinaceum, suggest a novel role of plasmepsin 4 in the malaria parasite life cycle.Remarkably, little is known about transport and trafficking of secretory proteins in Plasmodium ookinete stages. Apicomplexan parasites, although morphologically defined based on the apical structure, characteristically have three types of secretory organelles found in Plasmodium in merozoites and sporozoites but not ookinetes (which only have micronemes) as follows: rhoptries (involved in invasion and formation of parasitophorous vacuole); dense granules (thought to be involved in maintenance of the parasitophorous vacuole); and micronemes (involved in the secretion of both soluble and transmembrane proteins). Transmission-blocking targets such as chitinase, CTRP, and WARP are found in micronemes and are discharged onto the ookinete surface to facilitate invasion of the mosquito midgut (8.Li F.

Takeo S. Sattabongkot J. Torii M. Tsuboi T. Parasitol. Int. 2006; 55: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The micronemal localization and prominent apical staining pattern for PgPM4 and co-localization with chitinase, as demonstrated by deconvolution immunofluorescence microscopy, imply that these enzymes synergize in mosquito invasion at the level of the peritrophic matrix. This interpretation is further supported by P. gallinaceum membrane feeding experiments in which the combination of mAbs raised against PgCHT2 and PgPM4 reduces the oocyst number significantly compared with using either one of them individually. Again, the mechanism by which plasmepsin 4 is involved in ookinete infection of the mosquito has not been definitely established but must be experimentally distinguished from other potential protein and structural targets with which the ookinete comes into contact in the mosquito midgut.One potential concern about the presence of plasmepsin 4 in the ookinete culture supernatant is that perhaps it arises either from contaminating asexual stage parasites or spontaneous lysis of ookinetes during in vitro culture. In the P. gallinaceum cultures we performed, significant numbers of asexual forms are not observed because the gradient centrifugation step eliminates this stage of parasite. It is formally possible that ookinetes lysed under suboptimal culture conditions to a degree sufficient to yield detectable plasmepsin 4 in the culture supernatant. The results presented indicate that plasmepsin 4 is present within micronemes and on the parasite surface, and therefore its presence in ookinete culture supernatant is not parsimoniously explained by parasite lysis.Further evidence of the role of plasmepsin activity in parasite invasion of the mosquito midgut was suggested by the transmission blocking activity of aspartic protease-specific inhibitor pepstatin A, other peptidomimetic aspartic protease inhibitors, and calpain inhibitors.A number of studies have revealed an effect of pepstatin and other aspartic protease inhibitors on asexual blood stage parasite, suggesting one or more of the plasmepsins are essential for the survival of the parasites (38.Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Knickerbocker A. Mueller R. Bryant M.L. Sherman D.R. Russell D.G. Goldberg D.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 39.Haque T.S.

Parasitol. 1995; 80: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not address whether plasmepsins or aspartic proteases may also be required for the parasite development outside the asexual stage. To determine the role of plasmepsins in midgut invasion and oocyst development, studies with pepstatin A and a variety of peptidomimetic and natural product aspartic protease inhibitors were performed using membrane feeding assays. As shown in Table 1, nontoxic concentrations of pepstatin A, SQ 3000, and Po/vPM led to inhibited oocyst formation and reduced Plasmodium infectivity to the mosquito in a dose-dependent manner. The effective concentration started as low as 0.1 μm. Consistent with the results of pepstatin A on asexual stages parasites (28.Banerjee R. Francis S.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), immunoblot experiments on in vitro culture of ookinetes incubated with pepstatin A demonstrated that pepstatin A did not interfere with the processing of pro-plasmepsin 4, suggesting blocking of pro-plasmepsin 4 processing requires not only aspartic protease inhibitors but also other inhibitors, such as cysteine protease inhibitors, like what happened at asexual blood stages (28.Banerjee R. Francis S.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ookinete formation assay revealed that pepstatin A had no effect on the development of zygote to ookinetes in ookinete culture in vitro. These results suggest that PgPM4 was involved in penetration of peritrophic matrix/epithelial membrane and/or development of ookinete to oocyst.ALLN (calpain inhibitor I) and ALLM (calpain inhibitor II), inhibitors of the Ca2+-dependent neutral cysteine protease calpain I and calpain II, are also thought to be plasmepsin convertase inhibitors (28.Banerjee R. Francis S.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that at asexual stages calpain inhibitors I and II prevent activation of Plasmodium aspartic proteases (28.Banerjee R. Francis S.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) through inhibition of falcipain (31.Drew M.E. Banerjee R. Uffman E.W. Gilbertson S. Rosenthal P.J. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12870-12876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that although activation of pro-plasmepsin is unaffected by the addition of ALLN or ALLM to in vitro P. gallinaceum zygote cultures, membrane feeding experiments demonstrated that ALLM and high dose (20 μm) ALLN reduced oocyst numbers significantly. Calpain inhibitors did not interfere with the activation of the pro-plasmepsin 4 during the development of zygote to ookinete (data not shown), but calpain II and high concentrations of calpain I remarkably reduced ookinete formation and even block the ookinete development. It was obvious that the processing of pro-plasmepsin 4 occurred previous to the zygote stage, and some calpain-like proteins (other than PgPM4), which were critical for the development of zygote to ookinete, were inhibited by calpain inhibitors. In vitro, the activation of the rPgPM4 was pH-dependent and autocatalytically activated at pH 4.5. It is possible that in the ookinete plasmepsins traffic through the secretory organelle, microneme, to the plasma membrane of the parasite. However, it is not clear where the processing of pro-plasmepsin 4 takes place and whether an acidic pH is required inside the mosquito midgut. Western immunoblot experiments showed that PgPM4 found in the ookinete-conditioned medium is a catalytically active enzyme identical to that in the lysate of ookinete and zygote. There was no difference of PgPM4 expression patterns between conditioned medium/lysate under reduced and unreduced conditions (Fig. 2). The immunoelectron microscopy results demonstrated that PgPM4 was present in the microneme of ookinete, indicating it may be secreted via the microneme. The pH of the microneme remains unknown; however, it is possible that the pro-plasmepsin 4 is activated within the microneme prior to secretion. Alternatively, the activation/processing of pro-plasmepsin 4 may occur in acidic vacuoles in the zygote before secretion; EM micrographs have revealed many previously unreported cellular organelles in P. falciparum 3V. Bounkeua and F. Li, unpublished data. or mediated by other proteases at neutral pH after secretion. This interpretation is supported by evidence that P. falciparum plasmepsin PfPM2 not only digests hemoglobin in the food vacuole during its asexual proliferation in the erythrocytes but is also involved in remodeling the erythrocyte cytoskeleton by cleaving spectrin at neutral pH (32.Le Bonniec S. Deregnaucourt C. Redeker V. Banerjee R. Grellier P. Goldberg D.E. Schrével J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14218-14223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Because it is possible that these inhibitors are affecting mosquito-secreted as well as ookinete-secreted proteases, we repeated these studies using monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize ookinete-secreted plasmepsins. Comparison of both the mAbs and polyclonal antibody raised against PgPM4 with negative controls using isotype control or normal mouse serum, we demonstrate that anti-PM4 antibodies markedly reduced oocyst number and infection rate in a reproducible, dose-dependent manner. The concentration of mAb 2G4 that started to affect the transmission was as low as 50 μg/ml, consistent with the Western immunoblot result that showed that 2G4 had a stronger affinity for the mature enzyme, suggesting the efficiency and specificity of the mAb. Compared with negative control, the mAbs had no effect on ookinete formation and the processing of pro-plasmepsin 4 in the ookinete culture in vitro. These results suggested a possible role of PgPM4 involved in the mosquito midgut invasion and/or development of oocyst from ookinete. The experiments here indicate an important role of plasmepsin 4 in the molecular interaction of the malaria parasite with the mosquito midgut and/or the development of ookinete to oocyst. Further delineation of the mechanisms by which Plasmodium ookinete-secreted PM4 facilitates parasite invasion of the mosquito vector and/or development in mosquito midgut may suggest novel approaches to malaria control. IntroductionMalaria is the most important parasitic disease of man and a globally dominant cause of morbidity and mortality in humans (1.Sachs J. Malaney P. Nature. 2002; 415: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). The lack of an effective vaccine, the emergence of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, and insecticide-resistant vector mosquitoes all contribute to the increasing human toll of malaria. Malaria is transmitted through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. Preventing transmission from the human reservoir to the definitive host, the mosquito, is one approach to malaria control (2.Malkin E.M. Durbin A.P. Diemert D.J. Sattabongkot J. Wu Y. Miura K. Long C.A. Lambert L. Miles A.P. Wang J. Stowers A. Miller L.H. Saul A. Vaccine. 2005; 23: 3131-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Delineating the mechanisms by which the malaria parasite invades and infects mosquitoes may lead to new strategies to block malaria transmission (3.Carter R. Mendis K.N. Miller L.H. Molineaux L. Saul A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4.Vinetz J.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 295: 357-382PubMed Google Scholar).After a mosquito ingests infectious Plasmodium gametocytes, male and female gametes emerge in the midgut and rapidly fuse to form diploid zygotes. Parasites must then develop into motile ookinetes, penetrate and traverse the protein- and chitin-containing peritrophic matrix, and then cross the midgut epithelium to form oocysts (4.Vinetz J.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 295: 357-382PubMed Google Scholar). Developmentally regulated antigens of these stages are potential targets of antibodies induced by vaccination of the vertebrate host that are co-ingested with parasites as a mosquito takes a blood meal (5.Kaslow D.C. Chem. Immunol. 2002; 80: 287-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Such antibodies are called transmission-blocking antibodies, which act by interfering with parasite development within the mosquito midgut, thus preventing parasite transmission to the mosquito vector. Importantly, proteins expressed in the mosquito stages are less likely to be mutated in response to human immunological responses (6.Saul A. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2007; 20: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Hence, interfering in this part of the life cycle has the potential to reduce both transmission as well as the spread of drug-resistant parasites.Ookinete-expressed proteases have been proposed to play vital roles in ookinete invasion of peritrophic matrix and mosquito midgut (7.Langer R.C. Li F. Vinetz J.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8.Li F. Templeton T.J. Popov V. Comer J.E. Tsuboi T. Torii M. Vinetz J.M. J. Biol.

The peritrophic matrix is the first physical barrier faced by the ookinete as it escapes the blood meal. The peritrophic matrix is composed of proteins, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and chitin (10.Shen Z. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17665-17670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 11.Moskalyk L.A. Oo M.M. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Mol. Biol. 1996; 5: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Proteins, including chitin cross-linking proteins (peritrophins), have been reported to account for 22–55% of the total mass of the peritrophic matrix (10.Shen Z. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17665-17670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 11.Moskalyk L.A. Oo M.M. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Mol. Biol. 1996; 5: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Specific protease inhibitors added to infectious blood meals have been observed to reduce ookinete infectivity for the mosquito (12.Shahabuddin M. Criscio M. Kaslow D.C. Exp. Parasit. 1995; 80: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that ookinetes could use proteases to cross the midgut peritrophic matrix.The genome of P. falciparum encodes a large variety of proteases, including a diverse family of 10 aspartic proteases (designated plasmepsins) (13.Coombs G.H. Goldberg D.E. Klemba M. Berry C. Kay J. Mottram J.C. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Four plasmepsins are known to degrade hemoglobin in the digestive vacuole of asexual stage malaria parasites (14.Banerjee R. Liu J. Beatty W. Pelosof L. Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Functions of the remaining six plasmepsins have not been determined, although gene expression profiling and comprehensive proteomic analysis have demonstrated the presence of several plasmepsins in the sexual stage forms of P. falciparum, Plasmodium berghei, and Plasmodium yoelii (16.Hall N.

No role for any plasmepsin has been demonstrated in Plasmodium-mosquito interactions.In this study, we demonstrate that the P. gallinaceum plasmepsin 4 (PgPM4) 2The abbreviations used are: PgPM4P. gallinaceum plasmepsin 4IFAindirect immunofluorescence assaymAbmonoclonal antibodyALLNcalpain inhibitor I (sequence N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO)ALLMcalpain inhibitor II (sequence N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met-CHO)PBSphosphate-buffered salineHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidrPgPM4recombinant PgPM4. synergizes with the P. gallinaceum chitinase PgCHT2 (the ortholog of the P. falciparum chitinase (18.Li F.

These data are the first to indicate a specific mechanistic function for a plasmepsin in any stage of the malaria parasite other than the asexual blood stage. This aspartic protease plays an important role in ookinete invasion of the mosquito midgut and/or parasite development, and thus may be a novel target of blocking malaria transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1970400664,"Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase gene (AGXT). We have previously shown that P11L and I340M polymorphisms together with I244T mutation (AGXT-LTM) represent a conformational disease that could be amenable to pharmacological intervention. Thus, the study of the folding mechanism of AGXT is crucial to understand the molecular basis of the disease. Here, we provide biochemical and structural data showing that AGXT-LTM is able to form non-native folding intermediates. The three-dimensional structure of a complex between the bacterial chaperonin GroEL and a folding intermediate of AGXT-LTM mutant has been solved by cryoelectron microscopy. The electron density map shows the protein substrate in a non-native extended conformation that crosses the GroEL central cavity. Addition of ATP to the complex induces conformational changes on the chaperonin and the internalization of the protein substrate into the folding cavity. The structure provides a three-dimensional picture of an in vivo early ATP-dependent step of the folding reaction cycle of the chaperonin and supports a GroEL functional model in which the chaperonin promotes folding of the AGXT-LTM mutant protein through forced unfolding mechanism.

Chaperonins are ATP-dependent molecular machines that are able to bind misfolded protein substrates and promote their proper folding (1.Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2396) Google Scholar). Protein misfolding is the main mechanism involved in a large number of genetic diseases caused by missense mutations, giving rise to the concept of “conformational diseases ” (2.Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 3.Caughey B. Baron G.S. Nature. 2006; 443: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The role of chaperones in the pathogenesis of conformational diseases has been recently reviewed (4.Broadley S.A. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 2647-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A deficiency of the hepatic enzyme alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT, 2The abbreviations used are: AGXTalanine glyoxylate aminotransferasePH1primary hyperoxaluria type 1Cryo-EMcryoelectron microscopy. also known as AGT) is responsible for the rare hereditary disease primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) 259900). Insufficient AGXT activity leads to increased conversion of the substrate glyoxylate to the toxic ion oxalate, which subsequently accumulates as insoluble calcium salt in the kidney. In the later stages of the disease, calcium oxalate deposition becomes widespread and life-threatening unless liver and kidney transplantation is performed (5.Hoppe B. Beck B.B. Milliner D.S. Kidney Int. 2009; 75: 1264-1271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Most of the PH1 alleles detected in the Canary Islands patients carry the I244T mutation together with the polymorphisms P11L and I340M. These amino acid changes result in a misfolded protein (AGXT-LTM) that undergoes stable interaction with molecular chaperones and aggregation (6.Santana A. Salido E. Torres A. Shapiro L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7277-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A large number of the pathogenic variants of this protein are the result of missense mutations that are likely to result in misfolded proteins (7.Williams E.L. Acquaviva C. Amoroso A. Chevalier F. Coulter-Mackie M. Monico C.G. Giachino D. Owen T. Robbiano A. Salido E. Waterham H. Rumsby G. Hum. Mutat. 2009; 30: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, the study of these folding intermediates and the effect of the point mutations on the structure of the protein are central to elucidate the molecular basis responsible for the PH1 disease. alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase primary hyperoxaluria type 1 cryoelectron microscopy. The bacterial chaperonin-cochaperonin GroEL-GroES system is well characterized both at the biochemical and structural level (8.Saibil H.R. Ranson N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 627-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9.Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2003; 36: 229-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). GroEL is a large homo-oligomeric barrel structure formed by two rings each one comprising 7 subunits of a 57-kDa polypeptide chain. Each GroEL ring displays a large central cavity lined by hydrophobic residues at its entrance, which are responsible for substrate binding (10.Braig K. Adams P.D. Brünger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). GroES is a 70-kDa homoheptameric ring that caps both ends of the GroEL barrel and plays an important role in the folding cycle of GroEL (11.Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). The GroEL folding cycle first includes binding of a protein substrate to the apical domains of one of the rings (the cis-ring) followed by binding of ATP and GroES. This triggers a conformational change that makes the central cavity hydrophilic and leads to the encapsulation of the protein substrate. Binding of GroES and ATP to the opposite ring (trans-ring) results in the release of a properly folded protein substrate. The protein molecules that fail to fold are re-captured by GroEL for another reaction cycle. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments have been used to trap and follow the substrate conformational changes during the reaction cycle (12.Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 13.Lin Z. Madan D. Rye H.S. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Cell. 2008; 133: 142-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). First, it has been shown that ATP-mediated expansion of the GroEL apical domain induces the stretching of the partially folded protein substrates. This expansion actively facilities the folding by positioning a partially folded protein to a higher point in the energy landscape. Second, GroES binding produce a controlled collapse of the substrate during the release into the chaperonin cavity. To investigate the AGXT-LTM conformational changes responsible for PH1 in our patients, we have used an Escherichia coli strain that overexpresses GroEL-GroES system and AGXT-LTM protein. This enables trapping of in vivo folding intermediates of mutant AGXT and GroEL. This complex was reconstructed three-dimensionally by cryoelectron microscopy (Cryo-EM) and image-processing techniques, providing information of an early stage in the folding reaction cycle. The electron density map reveals that AGXT-LTM crosses the GroEL central cavity, making contacts with the apical domains of distant GroEL subunits. An atomic model of AGXT derived from its x-ray structure (16.Zhang X. Roe S.M. Hou Y. Bartlam M. Rao Z. Pearl L.H. Danpure C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) fits very well with the mass of the complex attributable to AGXT-LTM mutant protein, suggesting that the mutant protein is able to fold partially. Such folding intermediates could be targeted by molecular chaperones or other drugs to rescue the native conformation. Our results support the hypothesis that the assisted folding of AGXT-LTM mutant is driven through the forced unfolding of a quasi-native state of the protein. Top10 E. coli (Invitrogen) were transformed with AGXT constructs (6.Santana A. Salido E. Torres A. Shapiro L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7277-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and GroEL-ES plasmids (Takara, Inc.), using standard protocols (17.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY2001: A8.52-A8.55Google Scholar). They were grown at 37 °C in LB broth. GroEL-GroES expression was induced with 2 mg/ml l-arabinose at the beginning of the culture. AGXT expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside when the A600 was 0.4–0.6, and the culture was incubated for an additional 4 h at 25 °C. AGXT activity from the soluble extract was determined as described (6.Santana A. Salido E. Torres A. Shapiro L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7277-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Activity units are expressed as micromoles of pyruvate/h/mg of total protein. Cell pellets from 1 ml of culture were sonicated in 100 μl (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science) 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 0.05% Triton X-100). The soluble fraction was separated by centrifugation, and the protein concentration was measured with bicinchoninic acid. Equal amounts of each extract (1 μg) were analyzed by immunoblotting (17.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY2001: A8.52-A8.55Google Scholar) with anti-hAGXT (1:5,000) (rabbit, raised against recombinant AGXT). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used as secondary antibody (1:10,000), and the chemiluminescence substrate was from Pierce. Cells were harvested, and the His-tagged AGXT was purified using HisTrap FF columns (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Soluble AGXT was batch-purified under native conditions, and it was eluted from the Ni2+ resin in a buffer with 500 mm imidazole. Imidazole was removed using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare), and protein was concentrated by filtration (UltraFree 0.5, Millipore Corporation). GroEL was copurified with AGXT due to protein-protein interactions. Purified proteins were subjected to a size-exclusion chromatography (Bio-Silect SEC 250; Bio-Rad) to isolate the complex. The purified complex was used to test the effect of ATP in the interaction between both proteins after 20 min of incubation. For electron microscopy of negatively stained samples, 5-μl aliquots of a solution containing 0.05 mg/ml GroEL·AGXT-LTM complexes buffered with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl were applied to glow-discharged carbon-coated collodion grids for 1 min and then stained for 1 min with 2% uranyl acetate. Images were recorded in a JEOL 1200EX-II electron microscope operated at 100 kV and recorded at 20,000 nominal magnification. For Cryo-EM, 5-μl aliquots were applied to holey carbon grids (Quantifoil) for 2 min, blotted for 5 s, and frozen rapidly in liquid ethane. Images were recorded under minimum dose conditions in a FEI G2 FEG electron microscope operated at 200 kV using a Gatan cold stage and recorded on Kodak SO-163 film at 50,000 nominal magnification between 1.5 and 3.0 μm underfocus. Micrographs were digitized in a Zeiss Photoscan scanner with a final sampling window corresponding to 3.5 Å/pixel for negatively stained samples and 2.8 Å/pixel for vitrified samples. Contrast transfer function of micrographs was estimated using CTFFIND software (18.Mindell J.A. Grigorieff N. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 142: 334-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar) and corrected using BSOFT (19.Heymann J.B. Belnap D.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Images were two-dimensionally processed and aligned using maximum likelihood reference-free methods with the XMIPP package (20.Sorzano C.O. Marabini R. Velázquez-Muriel J. Bilbao-Castro J.R. Scheres S.H. Carazo J.M. Pascual-Montano A. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 21.Scheres S.H. Núñez-Ramírez R. Sorzano C.O. Carazo J.M. Marabini R. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 977-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). To analyze the heterogeneity of the particles, the images were subjected to Kohonen's self-organizing feature maps (22.Marabini R. Carazo J.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1804-1814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After this classification, homogeneous populations were obtained and averaged. To generate an initial model, either for the nucleotide-free or the ATP-bound samples, selected particles were subjected to a common lines procedure implemented in the EMAN software package (23.Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar) imposing C7 symmetry. Working with a total of 11,011 and 8,303 images (for nucleotide-free and ATP-bound samples, respectively) these initial rough models were refined imposing 7-fold or no symmetry using EMAN (23.Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar) and SPIDER software subsequently (24.Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). After reaching the convergence of these refinements, the reconstructions yielded resolutions of 23 Å and 24 Å for nonsymmetrized nucleotide-free and ATP-bound structures and of 27 Å for the nonsymmetrized native structure (Fourier Shell Correlation of 0.3 criterion). These models obtained from the negatively stained preparations were scaled and input to a two-independent refinement using 10,312 Cryo-EM particles with or without imposing C7 symmetry, using SPIDER software (24.Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). The resolutions of the final maps were estimated to 12 Å and 18 Å for the nonsymmetrized and symmetrized structures. These values were used to low pass filter the volume in the final model (see Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S2). Docking experiments were carried out using SITUS software (25.Chacón P. Wriggers W. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Volume handling was carried out using XMIPP software (20.Sorzano C.O. Marabini R. Velázquez-Muriel J. Bilbao-Castro J.R. Scheres S.H. Carazo J.M. Pascual-Montano A. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and general visualization was performed using Chimera (26.Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (25949) Google Scholar) and PyMol (27.DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). We first measured the AGXT activity from the soluble extracts when AGXT-LTM was expressed in E. coli either in the absence or presence of GroEL-GroES. Our data show that the AGXT activity of E. coli lysates increases when mutant AGXT-LTM is expressed in presence of the GroEL-GroES system (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis shows that this increase in activity is related to the amount of soluble AGXT-LTM mutant protein (Fig. 1B). This result indicates that GroEL-GroES coexpression improves, in vivo, the yield of soluble and active AGXT-LTM mutant protein. Lysates overexpressing His-tagged AGXT-LTM and GroEL-GroES were subjected to nickel-affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE of the eluted fractions showed two bands corresponding to the molecular weight of AGXT-LTM protein and to GroEL protomers. A final purification step by gel filtration chromatography revealed that the largest proportion of AGXT-LTM copurifies as a complex with GroEL (Fig. 1C). This result suggests that GroEL captures partially folded copies of AGXT-LTM mutant protein for a folding reaction cycle. Once the cell lysis occurs and the ATP is consumed, the folding reaction is blocked, trapping a stable GroEL·AGXT-LTM complex. The overexpression of the wild-type AGXT together with the GroEL-GroES system produced similar complexes, but the amount of stable and folded AGXT protein predominates (Fig. 1C). The purified complex was then incubated in the presence of a 10 molar excess ATP (ATP-bound) for comparison purposes. The new sample was subjected to the same purification steps, and the analysis of the SDS-PAGE confirms that the GroEL·AGXT-LTM complex is largely maintained in presence of ATP. The resulting GroEL·AGXT-LTM complex was stained for observation in the electron microscope to elucidate the nature of the interaction between both proteins before and after the conformational change undergone by GroEL upon ATP binding (see “Experimental Procedures ” and supplemental Fig. S1). 11,011 and 8,303 particles of the nucleotide-free and ATP-bound GroEL·AGXT-LTM complex were selected, respectively, and two-dimensional averages were generated using a maximum likelihood two-dimensional reference-free alignment process (Fig. 2A). The analysis revealed several classes that encompass the two typical views of GroEL, the end-on view revealing its heptameric nature, and the side view showing its two ring structure. The analysis of these classes confirms the formation of GroEL·AGXT-LTM complexes as the end-on view averages clearly show some extra density at the central folding cavity. The comparison of the equivalent two-dimensional classes corresponding to the nucleotide-free and ATP-bound samples revealed structural changes (supplemental Fig. S1). We analyzed these differences by comparing their low resolution three-dimensional structures generated after angular refinement. 7-fold symmetrized volumes of the two samples were first generated. The comparison of the two three-dimensional reconstructions showed differences both in the conformation of the GroEL chaperonin and in the relative position of the substrate with respect to the chaperonin (Fig. 2, B and C). The nucleotide-free structure showed approximately a 10% increase in height and width of the GroEL barrel with respect to the size of the ATP-bound sample, the latter being similar to the size observed for the substrate-free, nucleotide-free GroEL (10.Braig K. Adams P.D. Brünger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This enlargement results in an expansion of the folding cavity that has been already reported for other substrate-bound GroEL complexes (28.Clare D.K. Bakkes P.J. van Heerikhuizen H. van der Vies S.M. Saibil H.R. Nature. 2009; 457: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29.Chen D.H. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. Chiu W. Ludtke S.J.

Both complexes display extra density occluding the GroEL cavity that can be uniquely attributed to the presence of the protein substrate. However, this density protrudes from the chaperonin in the nucleotide-free complex and is internalized upon ATP binding. To characterize further the interactions between GroEL and the bound, unfolded protein, a three-dimensional reconstruction of the two different complexes was attempted without imposing any symmetry. It was not possible to obtain a stable asymmetric model for the ATP-bound preparation. This could be a reflection of heterogeneity in our data set due to substrate structural conformational variability. Indeed, the substrate density in the ATP-bound symmetrical model is considerably smaller than that observed in the nucleotide-free complex. This effect cannot be attributed solely to the application of 7-fold symmetry but also to the variable conformation distribution of the substrate in the GroEL cavity in the ATP-bound complex. Further evidence of this heterogeneity can be found in the analysis of the representative averaged end-on views obtained in the two-dimensional analysis of the samples. Although the nucleotide-free sample appears to be quite homogeneous, the ATP-bound sample is clearly heterogeneous, with the substrate adopting several conformations (see Fig. 2A). This is in agreement with the data presented by Elad et al. (30.Elad N. Clare D.K. Saibil H.R. Orlova E.V. J. Struct. Biol. 2008; 162: 108-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in which unfolded malate dehydrogenase internalized into GroEL cavity adopts several conformations. However, analysis of the low resolution nucleotide-free structure provides information of the nature of the GroEL·AGXT-LTM interaction. The level of resolution of this complex (23 Å) allows the identification of the density corresponding the AGXT-LTM mutant protein. It crosses the GroEL central cavity and makes contact with distant GroEL apical domains. To define a higher resolution description of the native complex, the sample was subjected to Cryo-EM techniques (see “Experimental Procedures ” and supplemental Fig. S2). More than 10,000 particles were selected and prepared for angular refinement methods. The models from the negative stained samples were the input for further refinement. Two independent refinement processes were carried out, with and without imposing 7-fold symmetry. The three-dimensional reconstruction obtained without imposing symmetry allowed us to obtain a model that contains details on the interaction between GroEL and AGXT-LTM mutant, but the resolution obtained was significantly lower. On the contrary, the refinement imposing 7-fold symmetry lacked this detailed information but could achieve better resolution for the chaperone moiety (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, the final structure shown in Fig. 3A represents a composite map formed by the GroEL moiety derived from the structure refined with symmetry and the substrate mass derived from the volume refined without symmetry. Therefore, the resolution for either section of the model is different: 12 Å for the chaperone and 18 Å for the substrate complex. The atomic coordinates of the GroEL crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1OEL) (31.Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar) were fitted into the electron micrograph density map as described under “Experimental Procedures. ” Considering each GroEL protomer as a rigid body, the analysis of the fitting clearly showed that GroEL apical domains lay outside the map. Then, we proceeded to readjust the position of the domain individually. This rendered an expanded GroEL “open” barrel in which the connections between the two ring structures are maintained but the apical domains are twisted by ∼20 degrees (Fig. 3B). We did not attempt to carry out any finer adjustments of the atomic coordinates to the Cryo-EM map. The extra density located in the cavity can be unequivocally assigned to AGXT-LTM, and it is structured in two domains. These are clearly asymmetric, each one interacting with the apical domains of opposite GroEL subunits. AGXT is a homodimer formed by two 43-kDa subunits, whose atomic structure is known (Protein Data Bank code 1H0C)) (16.Zhang X. Roe S.M. Hou Y. Bartlam M. Rao Z. Pearl L.H. Danpure C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Each protomer is folded into a large N-terminal domain (residues 22–282) and a smaller C-terminal domain (283–392). Besides, a long unstructured N-terminal tail (residues 1–21) grabs the subunits within the dimer (supplemental Fig. S3). The analysis of the size and shape of the AGXT-LTM density suggests that the protein adopts an almost folded but open conformation in which the two domains of AGXT interact with distant apical domains of GroEL. The AGXT atomic coordinates were used to define its two topological domains and fit into the Cryo-EM density map. Each domain fits well in the Cryo-EM map. Remarkably, the best solutions leave the C terminus of the N-terminal domain and the N terminus of the C-terminal domain in close vicinity, thus being compatible with an AGXT structure displaying an open expanded conformation (Fig. 3B). There is an extra density on the top of the oligomer that cannot be resolved in terms of the crystal structure of AGXT, but that could account for residues 1–22 of the AGXT structure. Because of the resolution of our model it is not possible to determine precisely the AGXT regions involved in GroEL binding. Remarkably, the unfolded AGXT interacts solely with the apical domains of GroEL. In this model, the surface patches responsible of the AGXT dimerization face either the hydrophobic patches of the apical domains or the folding cavity of the chaperone. This situation displays a striking similarity to that observed for the chaperonin-containing TCP1 interaction with actin and tubulin (32.Llorca O. McCormack E.A. Hynes G. Grantham J. Cordell J. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. Fernandez J.J. Valpuesta J.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 33.Llorca O. Martín-Benito J. Grantham J. Ritco-Vonsovici M. Willison K.R. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4065-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) in which chaperonin-containing TCP1 stabilizes both cytoskeletal proteins in open and quasi-folded conformations through interactions between distant subunits of the chaperonin ring. The combined biochemical and structural analysis on the GroEL·AGXT-LTM complexes indicates that we have been able to trap a functional folding intermediate of AGXT-LTM mutant protein that will proceed to its final native structure with the assistance of GroEL. Binding of unfolded AGXT to GroEL involves distant sides of the chaperonin folding cavity so that the substrate displays an expanded conformation. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments have demonstrated that subsequent ATP-induced domain movements in GroEL cause the stretching of the substrate and further unfolding and compaction of the substrate on the GroEL surface (13.Lin Z. Madan D. Rye H.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14.Madan D. Lin Z. Rye H.S. J. Biol.

Indeed, our structural data support this model because we observed that the incubation of the purified GroEL·AGXT-LTM complex with ATP induces the internalization of the density corresponding the AGXT-LTM substrate. Our data also support the model for a chaperone folding reaction cycle in which binding of a quasi-native AGXT to GroEL proceeds in an ATP-independent manner. This conformation could be reached with or without the help of other cofactors, or it could result from an unsuccessful GroEL folding reaction cycle. Nowadays, the most effective treatment for PH1 consists of either kidney and liver double transplantation or preemptive liver transplantation. Among the new pharmacological therapies under study, the use of chemical chaperones to bind and stabilize a native AGXT protein conformation is very attractive. With early intervention, such a chemoprophylactic approach would minimize renal damage and potentially avoid the significant morbi-mortality of liver transplantation and the adverse effects of immunosuppression. The effectiveness of the treatment would depend on the effect of the pathogenic mutations and subsequent protein conformation changes. Our data show that the aggregation-prone AGXT-LTM mutant protein retains partial function that is also able to form folding intermediates and that the GroEL-GroES system improves the yield of active and soluble protein. Consequently, it represents a promising target for pharmacological chaperones. Download .pdf (6.6 MB) Help with pdf files"

How resident cells discriminate between these scenarios to respond accordingly remains largely unknown. Here, we show that a step increase in compressive stress of physiological magnitude shrinks the lateral intercellular space between bronchial epithelial cells, but does so with strikingly slow exponential kinetics (time constant ~110 s). We confirm that epidermal growth factor (EGF)-family ligands are constitutively shed into the intercellular space and demonstrate that a step increase in compressive stress enhances EGF receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation with magnitude and onset kinetics closely matching those predicted by constant-rate ligand shedding in a slowly shrinking intercellular geometry. Despite the modest degree and slow nature of EGFR activation evoked by compressive stress, we find that the majority of transcriptomic responses to sustained mechanical loading require ongoing activity of this autocrine loop, indicating a dominant role for mechanotransduction through autocrine EGFR signaling in this context. A slow deformation response to a step increase in loading, accompanied by synchronous increases in ligand concentration and EGFR activation, provides one means for cells to mount a selective and context-appropriate response to a sustained change in mechanical environment.—Kojic, N., Chung, E., Kho, A.

https://openalex.org/W2171129177,"Interleukin-12 (IL-12), p80, and IL-23 are structurally related cytokines sharing a p40 subunit. We have recently demonstrated that celecoxib and its COX-2-independent analogue 4-trifluoromethyl-celecoxib (TFM-C) inhibit secretion but not transcription of IL-12 (p35/p40) and p80 (p40/p40). This is associated with a mechanism involving altered cytokine-chaperone interaction in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the present study, we found that celecoxib and TFM-C also block secretion of IL-23 (p40/p19 heterodimers). Given the putative ER-centric mode of these compounds, we performed a comprehensive RT-PCR analysis of 23 ER-resident chaperones/foldases and associated co-factors. This revealed that TFM-C induced 1.5–3-fold transcriptional up-regulation of calreticulin, GRP78, GRP94, GRP170, ERp72, ERp57, ERdj4, and ERp29. However, more significantly, a 7-fold up-regulation of homocysteine-inducible ER protein (HERP) was observed. HERP is part of a high molecular mass protein complex involved in ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Using co-immunoprecipitation assays, we show that TFM-C induces protein interaction of p80 and IL-23 with HERP. Both HERP siRNA knockdown and HERP overexpression coupled to cycloheximide chase assays revealed that HERP is necessary for degradation of intracellularly retained p80 by TFM-C.

In addition, p40 can be secreted both as a monomer and as a homodimer, named p80. Further members of this family include IL-27, which is a heterodimer consisting of the p40-related protein “Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3” (EBI3) and the p35-related subunit p28 and IL-35 (EBI3/p35) (1.Collison L.W.

Various small molecule drugs have been reported that are capable of blocking IL-12, IL-23, and p80 at distinct stages of their biological pathways (transcription, assembly, receptor binding, and signal transduction) (for review see Ref. 11.Vandenbroeck K. Alloza I. Gadina M. Matthys P. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 2004; 56: 145-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). One such compound is celecoxib (12.Alloza I. Baxter A. Chen Q. Matthiesen R. Vandenbroeck K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Celecoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug originally designed to specifically inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), up-regulated in cancer and sites of inflammation (13.Lou J.

However, COX-2 inhibitors have been subject to critical analysis because of cardiovascular problems, and a number of functions related to celecoxib are now known to be attributable to COX-2-independent mechanisms (12.Alloza I.

Experiments with other COX-2 inhibitors such as rofecoxib, ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen, DuP697, and NS298 have all shown that this calcium-mobilizing property is unique to celecoxib (12.Alloza I.

Baxter A. Chen Q. Matthiesen R. Vandenbroeck K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). TFM-C shares the effect of celecoxib in depleting ER Ca2+ stores in noncancerous HEK293 cells, i.e. the recombinant cytokine producer cells used in our study (12.Alloza I. Baxter A. Chen Q. Matthiesen R. Vandenbroeck K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For p80, this secretion block is accompanied with altered interaction with the ER chaperones calreticulin (CRT) and ERp44 (12.Alloza I. Baxter A. Chen Q. Matthiesen R. Vandenbroeck K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that celecoxib and TFM-C block secretion of a third dimeric member of the IL-12 subfamily, namely IL-23, concomitant with intracellular retention of the IL-23 subunit p19. In an attempt to identify the ER factors crucially involved in this process we analyzed the effect of TFM-C on expression of 23 ER chaperones and cofactors. We identified homocysteine-inducible endoplasmic reticulum protein (HERP) as the gene transcript most dramatically up-regulated by TFM-C.

HERP is a component of a larger ERAD retrotranslocation complex comprising the E3 ligase HRD1, Derlin-1, VIMP, and the ATPase p97 (26.Schulze A. Standera S. Buerger E. Kikkert M. van Voorden S.

In this study, we show that TFM-C induces protein interaction of HERP with intracellularly retained p80 and IL-23, and that HERP is functionally required for the degradation of intracellularly retained dimeric p80.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have demonstrated the ability of celecoxib and the non-coxib analogue TFM-C to inhibit the secretion of IL-23, as well as of IL-12 (p35/p40) and p80 (p40/p40) (12.Alloza I. Baxter A. Chen Q. Matthiesen R. Vandenbroeck K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas leaving secretion of monomeric p40 largely unaffected. TFM-C strongly up-regulates the expression of the ER transmembrane protein HERP, and by use of co-immunoprecipitation, CHX chase, and siRNA/overexpression assays, HERP is involved in delivery of p80 and IL-23 for degradation in TFM-C-treated cells.In conjunction with our earlier work (12.Alloza I. Baxter A. Chen Q. Matthiesen R. Vandenbroeck K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we can now present a more detailed rationale for the putative mechanism by which TFM-C inhibits folding and secretion, and induces degradation of IL-12-type cytokines. Whereas TFM-C was designed to have no COX-2 inhibitory activity (IC50 for inhibition of COX-2 of 8.2 μm for TFM-C versus 0.04 μm for celecoxib; see Ref. 12.Alloza I. Baxter A. Chen Q. Matthiesen R. Vandenbroeck K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), both celecoxib and TFM-C perturb Ca2+ homeostasis, most likely through blockage of ER Ca2+- ATPases (12.Alloza I. Baxter A. Chen Q. Matthiesen R. Vandenbroeck K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16.Johnson A.J. Hsu A.L. Lin H.P. Song X. Chen C.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 831-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TFM-C selectively inhibits secretion of dimeric polypeptide conformers of the IL-12 family (IL-12, p80, and IL-23), and to a much lesser extent of p40 monomers. Analysis of IgG1 secretion (Fig. 1) demonstrates that TFM-C-mediated perturbation of ER function does not induce a generic secretion block of oligomeric proteins and that TFM-C has a certain degree of selectivity for an as yet undefined group of susceptible secreted proteins that includes IL-12/p80/IL-23. Proteomic analysis of the secretome of cells treated with TFM-C is currently being undertaken to address the diversity and nature of susceptible secretory proteins. ER-targeting compounds, such as tunicamycin, have previously been shown to have little effect on the successful secretion of monoclonal antibodies (35.Barnabé N. Butler M. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 60: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).At the lowest concentration of celecoxib and TFM-C required for inducing IL-12 and p80 retention, there are no cytotoxic effects or significant alterations in the level of p40 or p35 subunit transcription (12.Alloza I. Baxter A. Chen Q. Matthiesen R. Vandenbroeck K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The comparison between intracellular and secreted levels of p19 (Fig. 1D) indicates that in celecoxib- and TFM-C-treated cells, p19 is not secreted as subunit of IL-23, yet it is still present intracellularly at levels similar to untreated control. In TFM-C-treated cells, p80 shows increased interaction with calreticulin, a luminal ER chaperone involved in ER quality control (ERQC) of folding and retention of misfolded proteins, as well as decreased interaction with the chaperone ERp44 (12.Alloza I. Baxter A. Chen Q. Matthiesen R. Vandenbroeck K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, TFM-C seems to induce, either through ER Ca2+ perturbation or an as yet unknown mechanism, compositional changes in the ER environment making it more hostile to sustenance of folding of IL-12-type proteins, thus leading to abrogation of ensuing secretion. Misfolded or non-native proteins are normally intercepted by the ERQC system prior to retrotranslocation and delivery for ERAD (36.Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). We wondered whether this holds true for the non-secreted p80 dimers produced in TFM-C-treated cells. We addressed this question in first instance by analyzing the effect of TFM-C on transcriptional regulation of 23 ER-resident proteins. Out of 23 ER chaperones and associated factors analyzed, HERP was identified as the factor showing the most dramatic, i.e. 7-fold, up-regulation by TFM-C. To a lesser extent, the mRNA levels of CRT, GRP78, GRP94, GRP170, ERp72, ERp57, ERdj4, and ERp29 showed statistically significant differences as well. Of these, celecoxib has already been shown to increase the expression of the ER chaperones GRP78 and GRP94 in a wider proteomics analysis of its effects on intracellular proteins (13.Lou J. Fatima N. Xiao Z. Stauffer S. Smythers G. Greenwald P. Ali I.U. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2006; 15: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and of ORP150/GRP170, GRP78, ERdj3, and ERdj4 in human gastric carcinoma cell lines (18.Tsutsumi S. Namba T. Tanaka K. Arai Y. Ishihara T. Aburaya M. Mima S. Hoshino T. Mizushima T. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1018-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 37.Namba T. Hoshino T. Tanaka K. Tsutsumi S. Ishihara T. Mima S. Suzuki K. Ogawa S. Mizushima T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 860-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The celecoxib analogue 2,5-dimethylcelecoxib (DMC) has also been shown to up-regulate GRP78 in glioblastoma cell lines (38.Kardosh A. Golden E.B. Pyrko P. Uddin J. Hofman F.M. Chen T.C. Louie S.G. Petasis N.A. Schönthal A.H. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, the modulation of ER chaperone expression in response to celecoxib is shared with DMC and TFM-C despite the structural modifications in the latter compounds, and is reminiscent of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (39.Lai E. Teodoro T. Volchuk A. Physiology. 2007; 22: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Part of the induction of the UPR is a decrease in general protein synthesis as biological means toward decreasing the protein folding load within the ER (40.Malhotra J.D. Kaufman R.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 716-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). This has shown to be the case with celecoxib treatment, but only at higher concentrations approaching 100 μm, whereas general protein synthesis remains relatively unaffected below this concentration (41.Pyrko P. Kardosh A. Schönthal A.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2008; 75: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It would appear that 50 μm TFM-C induces a pre-apoptotic state in the ER, which causes retention of IL-12 family cytokines. Mild TFM-C-induced ER calcium perturbation may result in ineffective Ca2+-dependent chaperone function. A link between GRP78 and GRP94 up-regulation because of ER calcium depletion has long been identified (42.Li W.W. Alexandre S. Cao X. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12003-12009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The low cytotoxicity of both celecoxib and TFM-C in EcR293p40His cells (12.Alloza I. Baxter A. Chen Q. Matthiesen R. Vandenbroeck K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), coupled to little apoptosis in 50 μm celecoxib-treated cells (18.Tsutsumi S. Namba T. Tanaka K. Arai Y. Ishihara T. Aburaya M. Mima S. Hoshino T. Mizushima T. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1018-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) suggests at this level, that cells can successfully compensate for calcium perturbation through increased chaperone expression. This appears sufficient to prevent terminal protein misfolding on a scale, which would lead to overwhelming of the unfolded protein response and apoptosis, a tipping point which seems to be reached at concentrations around 100 μm celecoxib or TFM-C, and much less so at 50 μm.Mechanistically of relevance to the cellular tolerance for 50 μm TFM-C, was the discovery that HERP was by some distance the ER factor showing the highest level of inducibility. HERP is ubiquitously expressed (19.Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), whereas analysis in HT29, LNCaP, and EcR293 (HEK293) cells (Fig. 2B) suggests that TFM-C-induced up-regulation is also ubiquitous. HERP is also strongly up-regulated by thapsigargin, but only marginally by the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib or the geldanamycin analogue 17AAG (Fig. 2C), in line with an earlier report showing HERP up-regulation by thapsigargin and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (19.Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). HERP resides normally in the trans-Golgi network, but relocates mainly to the ER upon calcium perturbation with thapsigargin (43.Tuvia S. Taglicht D. Erez O. Alroy I. Alchanati I. Bicoviski V. Dori-Bachash M. Ben-Avraham D. Reiss Y. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In neuronal cells, HERP is capable of preventing ER stress-induced apoptosis by stabilizing ER Ca2+ levels (33.Chan S.L. Fu W. Zhang P. Cheng A. Lee J. Kokame K. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28733-28743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Taken together with the data presented here, it can be inferred with some degree of certainty that the HERP-inducing properties of TFM-C are a COX-2-independent function of celecoxib and are likely associated with perturbation of ER calcium levels.HERP is part of high molecular mass protein complex involved in ERAD (26.Schulze A. Standera S. Buerger E. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Koning F. Kloetzel P.M. Seeger M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and is regulated by the ER stress-specific branch of the UPR (21.Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13792-13799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 22.Liang G. Audas T.E. Li Y. Cockram G.P. Dean J.D. Martyn A.C. Kokame K. Lu R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 7999-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23.Sai X. Kokame K. Shiraishi H. Kawamura Y. Miyata T. Yanagisawa K. Komano H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), making it a prime candidate for a role in degradation of secretion-incompetent IL-12-type cytokines retained within TFM-C-treated cells. In immunoprecipitation experiments under DSP cross-linking conditions, HERP was co-captured with p80 and IL-23 in TFM-C-treated cells (Fig. 4). Because of the reducing nature of the experiment, it cannot conclusively be proven that HERP is co-captured with the cytokine subunits in monomeric or dimeric form, or indeed both. Because TFM-C and celecoxib have consistently been shown to leave p40 monomer secretion largely intact (Fig. 1, A and B), it can be inferred that the co-captured HERP is likely to be associated with retained p80 or IL-23.A role for HERP in degradation of secretion-incompetent p80 was further substantiated in CHX chase experiments using cells transfected with HERP siRNA and treated with TFM-C (Fig. 6). Whereas in cells transfected with control siRNA, p80 is virtually completely degraded at 2 h of CHX chase, a dramatic accumulation of p80 was evident in cells treated with HERP siRNA at this time point. In a complementary experiment, ectopic expression of HERP effectuated rapid and enhanced clearance of p80 in TFM-C-stressed cells compared with cells transfected with empty vector, while no such effect was apparent in untreated cells (Fig. 7). Thus, unlike other proteins degraded in a HERP-dependent manner, such as connexin 43 (24.Hori O. Ichinoda F. Yamaguchi A. Tamatani T. Taniguchi M. Koyama Y. Katayama T. Tohyama M. Stern D.M. Ozawa K. Kitao Y. Ogawa S. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and CD3-delta (26.Schulze A. Standera S. Buerger E. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Koning F. Kloetzel P.M. Seeger M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), both of which are native substrates of ERAD, p80 does not appear to be targeted for degradation by HERP in the absence of an ER stress response. It is therefore possible that the p80 dimers intercepted by and degraded through HERP under conditions of TFM-C treatment occur in a non-native/misfolded conformation. Our earlier observation of enhanced interaction between p80 and the ERQC factor CRT in TFM-C-treated cells (12.Alloza I. Baxter A. Chen Q. Matthiesen R. Vandenbroeck K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), lends support to this hypothesis.At this point, it is unknown whether p80 and IL-23 interact directly with HERP or whether HERP is simply co-captured as part of the larger HERP-containing retrotranslocation complex, because of DSP cross-linking used in this experiment (Fig. 4). HERP has also been identified to bind directly to the ER transmembrane E3 ligase HRD1. HRD1 in turn binds to the ER membrane protein Derlin-1 and the cytosolic p97 (26.Schulze A. Standera S. Buerger E. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Koning F. Kloetzel P.M. Seeger M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 27.Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The membrane protein VIMP is subsequently recruited to the complex by p97. Studies of the GRP78 substrates, non-secreted Igκ LC, mutant Igγ LC and truncated Igγ HC, show all three interact with HERP (25.Okuda-Shimizu Y. Hendershot L.M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 544-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, US11 from cytomegalovirus induces MHC I complex retrotranslocation resulting in a direct association with Derlin-1 and VIMP. Thus, HERP and p80/IL-23 may directly interact, but as Derlin-1 is the putative translocation pore (27.Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), it is also possible that these cytokines interact with Derlin-1 and that HERP is co-purified through its interaction with Derlin-1 via HRD1. Further elucidation of the composition of the cytokine-associated heteromeric HERP retrotranslocation complex is being addressed through diagonal electrophoresis.In conclusion, the intracellular retention of IL-12, IL-23, and p80 by celecoxib and TFM-C represents a novel anti-inflammatory property of celecoxib, one independent of COX-2 inhibition. This is likely to contribute significantly to the overall spectrum of anti-inflammatory properties of celecoxib, because of inhibition of differentiation of IL-12-based IFN-γ producing Th1 cells and IL-23-based IL-17 producing Th17 cells; as well as of the neutrophil chemo-attractant properties of p80 (44.Paunovic V.

https://openalex.org/W2084679782,"We describe for the first time fluorescent virus-like particles decorated with biologically active mono- and multisubunit immune receptors of choice and the basic application of such fluorosomes (FSs) to visualize and target immune receptor-ligand interactions. For that purpose, human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells were stably transfected with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) matrix protein (MA) GFP fusion constructs. To produce FSs, interleukins (ILs), IL-receptors (ILRs), and costimulatory molecules were fused to the glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol anchor acceptor sequence of CD16b and coexpressed along with MoMLV group-specific antigen-polymerase (gag-pol) in MA:GFP+ HEK-293 cells. We show that IL-2 decorated but not control-decorated FSs specifically identify normal and malignant IL-2 receptor-positive (IL-2R+) lymphocytes by flow cytometry. In addition to cytokines and costimulatory molecules, FSs were also successfully decorated with the heterotrimeric IL-2Rs, allowing identification of IL-2+target cells. Specificity of binding was proven by complete inhibition with nonlabeled, soluble ligands. Moreover, IL-2R FSs efficiently neutralized soluble IL-2 and thus induced unresponsiveness of T cells receiving full activation stimuli via T-cell antigen receptor and CD28. FSs are technically simple, multivalent tools for assessing and blocking mono- and multisubunit immune receptor-ligand interactions with natural constituents in a plasma membrane context.—Kueng, H.

Mouse Paneth cells also express α-defensin-related Defcr-rs genes that code for cysteine-rich sequence 4C (CRS4C) peptides that have a unique CPX triplet repeat motif. In ileitis-prone SAMP1/YitFc mice, Paneth cell levels of CRS4C mRNAs and peptides are induced more than a 1000-fold relative to non-prone strains as early as 4 weeks of age, with the mRNA and peptide levels highest in distal ileum and below detection in duodenum. CRS4C-1 peptides are found exclusively in Paneth cells where they occur only in dense core granules and thus are secreted to function in the intestinal lumen. CRS4C bactericidal peptide activity is membrane-disruptive in that it permeabilizes Escherichia coli and induces rapid microbial cell K+ efflux, but in a manner different from mouse α-defensin cryptdin-4. In in vitro studies, inactive pro-CRS4C-1 is converted to bactericidal CRS4C-1 peptide by matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) proteolysis of the precursor proregion at the same residue positions that MMP-7 activates mouse pro-α-defensins. The absence of processed CRS4C in protein extracts of MMP-7-null mouse ileum demonstrates the in vivo requirement for intracellular MMP-7 in pro-CRS4C processing.

The two-exon α-defensin genes expressed by small intestinal Paneth cells of rhesus macaque, mouse, and rat undergo extensive duplication events and rapid diversification (29.Patil A. Hughes A.L. Zhang G. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 20: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the mouse, α-defensin genes duplicated and diversified further to give rise to the Defcr-rs gene subfamily that codes for numerous cysteine-rich sequence 4C (CRS4C) peptides that are unique to mice (30.Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Defcr-rs and α-defensin (Defcr) genes have similar two-exon structures and normally are expressed only by Paneth cells in mouse small bowel. The first exons of mouse Defcr-rs and Defcr genes have ∼95% nucleotide sequence identity and code for nearly identical proregions (31.Huttner K.M. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J.

Despite that extensive identity, however, Defcr-rs gene second exons code for Cys-rich, cationic CRS4C peptides that are not α-defensin paralogs. Instead, they are characterized by seven repeats of a CPX triplet motif that is unique to this defensin peptide subfamily and found only in the mouse (32.Huttner K.M. Ouellette A.J.

Native CRS4C peptides purified from mouse small intestine exist as disulfide-stabilized homodimers and heterodimers that are antibacterial (33.Hornef M.W. Pütsep K. Karlsson J. Refai E. Andersson M. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 836-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, details of their expression patterns, post-translational processing, and mechanisms of action remain obscure. Here, we report that small intestinal levels of Paneth cell-specific CRS4C mRNAs and peptides are markedly and differentially elevated in the ileum of the SAMP1/YitFc mouse, a strain prone to spontaneous ileitis (35.Rivera-Nieves J.

CRS4C peptides are constituents of Paneth cell dense core granules and are selectively expressed in distal small bowel, and MMP-7 is required to process pro-CRS4C in vivo. MMP-7 can also activate pro-CRS4C-1 in vitro by a mechanism similar to mouse pro-α-defensin processing, converting inactive pro-CRS4C molecules to bactericidal, membrane-disruptive peptides.

Fusion proteins were exposed to 10 mg/ml CNBr in 80% formic acid for 18 h at 25 °C, diluted with water, and lyophilized. Cleavage products resuspended in 5% (v/v) acetic acid were separated by C18 and C4 reversed phase HPLC with a gradient of acetonitrile and with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as an ion-pairing agent. Peptide homogeneity was confirmed by analytical AU-PAGE. The molecular masses were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mode mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in a Voyager-DE MALDI-TOF spectrometer (PE-Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Levels of Crp and CRS4C mRNAs in mouse small intestinal segments were quantified by real-time PCR analysis using an ABI PRISM SDS7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) as described by the manufacturer. cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription using random hexamers (1 μg) and 10 ng of total RNA in a final reaction volume of 20 μl containing 200 units of Superscript (Invitrogen). Primers for measuring levels of mRNA were: CRS4C forward primer, 5′-CGCAG CCATG AAGAA ACTTG-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GAATC AGCCT GGACC TGGAA-3′; Crps, pan-Crp forward primer, 5′-AAGAG ACTAA AACTG AGGAG CAGC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GGTGA TCATC AGACC CCAGC ATCAG T-3′, which amplify all mouse Crp mRNA sequences. PCR was performed in triplicate using 10% (v/v) of the first strand synthesis in a total vol of 50 μl that included 25 μl SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems) and a 250 nm final concentration of primers. The amplification of cDNA was performed for 40 cycles by a preset cycling program that included the generation of a melting curve. Thermocycling conditions were: (i) 50 °C for 2 min (activation of AmpErase UNG); (ii) 95 °C for 10 min (activation of AmpliTaq Gold enzyme); (iii) 95 °C for 15 s (denaturation) and 60 °C for 1 min (anneal/extend) for 40 cycles. The ΔCT method was used to quantify relative mRNA levels as described in User Bulletin 2 (Applied Biosystems), using 18 S RNA as the reference and internal standard. A TaqMan primer probe set for 18 S RNA with the Vic/Tamra detection system was used to measure 18 S RNA in replicate samples simultaneously. The CRS4C primers were based on regions of identity in small intestinal cDNAs or genes from 129/SvJ, C3H/HeJ, C3H/HeN, NMRI/KI, FVB, and BALB/c mice. Those same primers were used to clone and sequence ∼30 CRS4C cDNAs from SAMP1/YitFc ileum, which were identical to reported CRS4C cDNA sequences (32.Huttner K.M. Ouellette A.J.

Thus, the primers are appropriate for quantitation of CRS4C mRNA levels in varied mouse strains, including the SAMP1/YitFc strain. The immune antigens consisted of recombinant CRS4C-1(59–72) and Crp-5 peptide pET-28a fusion proteins expressed in E. coli (1.Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin.

For immunization purposes, a single 7–15-month-old cross-bred goat (35–50 kg) was immunized by subcutaneous injection of 1 mg of Crp-5 or CRS4C-1 fusion proteins emulsified with Complete Freund's Adjuvant (Elmira Biologicals, Iowa City, IA) under conditions approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Elmira Biologicals. Six weeks after initial immunization, goats were boosted by an injection of an additional 1 mg of peptide antigen in the absence of adjuvant. Sera were collected 8–9 days after each antigen boost and tested for peptide specificity by immunoblotting and by Western blots. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was isolated from antiserum by DEAE Econo-Pac chromatography (Bio-Rad) as recommended by the manufacturer. Peptide specificity of the antibody was determined by assessing immunoreactivity against recombinant proCRS4C-1, mature CRS4C-1, pro-Crp-4, and mature Crp-4 immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes, with the antibody demonstrating reactivity only with the proform and mature form of CRS4C-1 (data not shown). For immunohistochemical localization of CRS4C-1 in SAMP1/YitFc mouse, ileal segments were rapidly dissected from SAMP1/YitFc and AKR mice at 10 weeks of age, fixed in Bouin fixative, and embedded in paraffin as described previously (40.Vidrich A.

https://openalex.org/W2026490794,"A gene encoding an L-lysine dehydrogenase was identified in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii. The gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and its product was purified and characterized. The expressed enzyme is the most thermostable L-lysine dehydrogenase yet described, with a half-life of 180 min at 100 degrees C. The product of the enzyme's catalytic activity is Delta(1)-piperideine-6-carboxylate, which makes this enzyme an L-lysine 6-dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.18) that catalyzes the reductive deamination of the epsilon- amino group and a type of NAD-dependent amine dehydrogenase. The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme was determined using the mercury-based multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion method at a resolution of 2.44 A in the presence of NAD and sulfate ion. The asymmetric unit consisted of two subunits, and a crystallographic 2-fold axis generated the functional dimer. Each monomer consisted of a Rossmann fold domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain, and the fold of the catalytic domain showed similarity to that of saccharopine reductase. Notably, the structures of subunits A and B differed significantly. In subunit A, the active site contained a sulfate ion that was not seen in subunit B. Consequently, subunit A adopted a closed conformation, whereas subunit B adopted an open one. In each subunit, one NAD molecule was bound to the active site in an anti-conformation, indicating that the enzyme makes use of pro-R-specific hydride transfer between the two hydrides at C-4 of NADH (type A specificity). This is the first description of the three-dimensional structure of l-lysine 6-dehydrogenase as an NAD-dependent amine dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W2010739813,"Volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying (VSOR) Cl(-) channels are critical for the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) response triggered upon cell swelling. Recent evidence indicates that H(2)O(2) plays an essential role in the activation of these channels and that H(2)O(2) per se activates the channels under isotonic isovolumic conditions. However, a significant difference in the time course for current onset between H(2)O(2)-induced and hypotonicity-mediated VSOR Cl(-) activation is observed. In several cell types, cell swelling induced by hypotonic challenges triggers the release of ATP to the extracellular medium, which in turn, activates purinergic receptors and modulates cell volume regulation. In this study, we have addressed the effect of purinergic receptor activation on H(2)O(2)-induced and hypotonicity-mediated VSOR Cl(-) current activation. Here we show that rat hepatoma cells (HTC) exposed to a 33% hypotonic solution responded by rapidly activating VSOR Cl(-) current and releasing ATP to the extracellular medium. In contrast, cells exposed to 200 microm H(2)O(2) VSOR Cl(-) current onset was significantly slower, and ATP release was not detected. In cells exposed to either 11% hypotonicity or 200 microm H(2)O(2), exogenous addition of ATP in the presence of extracellular Ca(2+) resulted in a decrease in the half-time for VSOR Cl(-) current onset. Conversely, in cells that overexpress a dominant-negative mutant of the ionotropic receptor P2X4 challenged with a 33% hypotonic solution, the half-time for VSOR Cl(-) current onset was significantly slowed down. Our results indicate that, at high hypotonic imbalances, swelling-induced ATP release activates the purinergic receptor P2X4, which in turn modulates the time course of VSOR Cl(-) current onset in a extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent manner."
