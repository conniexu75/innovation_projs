The production and properties of aerosporin are under investigation by a group of workers at the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories, and the purpose of the present communication is to direct attention to certain aspects of these studies, the results of which will be published in detail elsewhere."

https://openalex.org/W1986876756,"Although the Fourier method of synthesis has enjoyed a long and justified supremacy in the armoury of techniques for X-ray structure analysis, the time is rapidly approaching when its use will be limited by the complexity of the structures investigated. In the absence of any universally applicable method of obtaining phase angles, Fourier refinement can be applied only to those structures which are sufficiently simple for an accurate estimate of their parameters to be made. It is an unfortunate fact that the Fourier refinement process converges only if the trial parameters are reasonably close to the true ones, and the region of convergence is roughly that of the differential method1."

https://openalex.org/W2047362415,"In a study of creatinine metabolism in the rat, to be published elsewhere, creatinine has been identified qualitatively by means of the technique of partition chromatography on paper strips developed by Consden, Gordon and Martin1. The apparatus described by Dent2 has been used, with the further refinement of accurate temperature control obtained by immersing the outer glass container in a water thermostat at 15 ± 0·05°C. Solutions containing c. 20–30 γ of creatinine were pipetted on to the paper strips, and after treatment with an appropriate solvent, for example, collidine for 24 hours, the creatinine bands were located by spraying with alkaline sodium picrate."

https://openalex.org/W1982507181,"I have observed large cells of the intimal layer of retinal arterioles, capillaries and venules situated mostly at vessel branches. These cells reduce the lumen to a narrow slit or occlude it completely. The protoplasm of these cells is granular and gives them an appearance different from that of the other intimal cells. These cushion cells are best visible unstained in glycerine-cleared retina with reduced illumination."

https://openalex.org/W2017659008,"Jorpes1, studying the chemistry of heparin, and, before him, Demole2 and Fischer3, have insisted upon the importance of the—SO3H group for the inhibition of blood-clotting. Link et al.4 have proved that salycilates have an antiprothrombinæmic effect, which is about twenty times weaker than the equivalent dose of ‘Dicumarol’ (Quick5, McKennie6). In order to get comparable data between the retarding influence on blood-clotting and the chemical constitution, we have measured the effect of the following hydrotropic substances in vitro: the sodium salts of phenyl-sulphonic acid, 1,4-oxy-phenyl-sulphonic acid, salycilic acid, 1,3-phenyl-disulphonic acid, 1,3,5-phenyl-trisulphonic acid. The method consists in mixing in small test-tubes 0.1 ml. of normal oxalated blood-plasma (human) with 0.1 ml. of a mixture of phosphate buffer and hydrotropic substance, and 0.2 ml. ‘Thromboplastin’ (Hoffmann–LaRoche, Basle). The phosphate buffer consists of M/30 potassium dihydrogen phosphate and disodium hydrogen phosphate, so as to give a pH of 7.2. It contains, further, sufficient hydrotropic substance to make it one third molar."

Stotler demonstrated at the sixtieth annual meeting of the American Association of Anatomists osmophilic granules in chromatolytic nerve cells; an account of this has been published1. This interesting finding is in agreement with our observations during the past few years2, that when using the Marchi reaction for degenerated fibres not only the degenerating myelin can be shown by the Swank–Davenport method, but also fine black granules in certain nerve cells."

https://openalex.org/W2019216278,"Bending a selenium rectifier disk causes a temporary increase of the current flowing through it in both directions. The effect (discovered in December 1942) is especially pronounced in the reverse direction, where a momentary increase of the current intensity up to 300 per cent and more can be produced through bending by hand, while in the forward direction values exceeding 5–10 per cent have not been observed. With copper oxide rectifiers no trace of a similar effect could be detected. The following, mostly qualitative, observations were made on our own disks, in the reverse direction: (1) The bending causes an increase of the current, whether the selenium layer lies on the convex or on the concave side of the disk. (2) In general, the stronger the bending the greater the effect. (3) The increase of current is, at its maximum, a temporary one. After bending a disk with a constant force, the momentary increased current intensity diminishes in the first few seconds rapidly, then slowly, and reaches its end value after some minutes. The behaviour of the disk is then, within certain narrow limits, that of a biased system: an increase of the bending increases also the current and vice versa. (4) Temperature has a pronounced influence; at 40–50° C., the effect is essentially smaller, and it seems to disappear more rapidly than at room temperature. (5) The effect depends upon the applied voltage. While at small voltages (1–2 volts) no effect is observable, with increasing voltages it increases also rapidly and reaches a maximal value as high as 350 per cent 15–20 volts with some disks."

https://openalex.org/W2077440612,"The “Oxford Dictionary” defines ‘dialysate’ as that portion of a mixture that remains after dialysis, and quotes Attfield's “Text-book of Chemistry” (1885). The quotation shows that the part that fails to pass through the membrane is referred to. From the point of view of the lexicographer, this is perfectly satisfactory; there seems to have been no earlier use of the word in print. Graham, for example, although he coined the word ‘dialyser’ and gave a new meaning to the word ‘dialysis’ did not apparently use ‘dialysate’."

It seems probable, therefore, that the presence in the umbilical circulation of increased bilirubin, demonstrated by the indirect reaction, might be interpreted as early diagnostic evidence of hæmolytic disease of the newborn."

https://openalex.org/W2017095194,"IN March, 1946, the Section of Biology of the New York Academy of Sciences held a conference on the “Relation of Diseases of the Lower Animals to Human Welfare”, and the nine papers read before this conference have been published in the Annals of the Academy (48, Art. 6, pp. 351–576; 1947). These papers, each of which is contributed by an expert, deal with rabies, equine encephalomyelitis, psittacosis and diseases related to it, brucellosis, plague, tuberculosis, anthrax, swine erysipelas and various animal parasites transmissible to man. In his introductory address, W. A. Hagan points out that the authors of the various papers consider primarily diseases of animals which are more or less directly transmissible to man, but that these diseases also affect the welfare of mankind by their economic effects. Obviously, for example, they affect our food supplies and, in addition, many people depend for their livelihood upon the rearing of farm animals."
