https://openalex.org/W2062291020,"Biochemical and genetic studies of a tobacco mutant resistant to the herbicides chlorsulfuron and sulfometuron methyl have demonstrated that these sulfonylurea herbicides inhibit acetolactate synthase, the first enzyme specific to the branched chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway. Resistance of this mutant is accomplished by production of a form of the enzyme that is insensitive to inhibition by the two herbicides."

https://openalex.org/W2031829069,"The Swedish PIUS reactor and the German-American small modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactor are inherently safe-that is, their safety relies not upon intervention of humans or of electromechanical devices but on immutable principles of physics and chemistry. A second nuclear era may require commercialization and deployment of such inherently safe reactors, even though existing light-water reactors appear to be as safe as other well-accepted sources of central electricity, particularly hydroelectric dams."

https://openalex.org/W2042943912,"A new technique for replicating in plastic the fossils preserved in clastic rocks should now make available reliable morphologic and frequency data, comparable in quality to those derived from acid-prepared silicified faunas, for a major segment of the fossil record. The technique involves three steps: the dissolution of carbonate in fossiliferous rocks with hydrochloric acid, impregnation of resulting voids with liquid plastic, and dissolution of the rock matrix with hydrofluoric acid, leaving a concentrate of plastic-replaced fossils."
