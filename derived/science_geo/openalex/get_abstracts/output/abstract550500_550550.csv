https://openalex.org/W2237475663,"Large-scale genomic studies have identified multiple somatic aberrations in breast cancer, including copy number alterations and point mutations. Still, identifying causal variants and emergent vulnerabilities that arise as a consequence of genetic alterations remain major challenges. We performed whole-genome small hairpin RNA (shRNA) ""dropout screens"" on 77 breast cancer cell lines. Using a hierarchical linear regression algorithm to score our screen results and integrate them with accompanying detailed genetic and proteomic information, we identify vulnerabilities in breast cancer, including candidate ""drivers,"" and reveal general functional genomic properties of cancer cells. Comparisons of gene essentiality with drug sensitivity data suggest potential resistance mechanisms, effects of existing anti-cancer drugs, and opportunities for combination therapy. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this large dataset by identifying BRD4 as a potential target in luminal breast cancer and PIK3CA mutations as a resistance determinant for BET-inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2239411622,"While signatures of attention have been extensively studied in sensory systems, the neural sources and computations responsible for top-down control of attention are largely unknown. Using chronic recordings in mice, we found that fast-spiking parvalbumin (FS-PV) interneurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) uniformly show increased and sustained firing during goal-driven attentional processing, correlating to the level of attention. Elevated activity of FS-PV neurons on the timescale of seconds predicted successful execution of behavior. Successful allocation of attention was characterized by strong synchronization of FS-PV neurons, increased gamma oscillations, and phase locking of pyramidal firing. Phase-locked pyramidal neurons showed gamma-phase-dependent rate modulation during successful attentional processing. Optogenetic silencing of FS-PV neurons deteriorated attentional processing, while optogenetic synchronization of FS-PV neurons at gamma frequencies had pro-cognitive effects and improved goal-directed behavior. FS-PV neurons thus act as a functional unit coordinating the activity in the local mPFC circuit during goal-driven attentional processing."

Our findings also provide an important mechanistic insight into how mutations in these genes may lead to circuit dysfunction in diseases such as autism. Neuronal communication flows through highly specialized cell junctions called synapses. Trans-synaptic adhesions between presynaptic neurexins (NRX) and postsynaptic neuroligins (NL) are critical for the formation and maturation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses (Baudouin and Scheiffele, 2010Baudouin S. Scheiffele P. SnapShot: neuroligin-neurexin complexes.Cell. 2010; 141: 908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutations in NRXs and NLs are linked to many neurological disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, depression, and addiction, highlighting the importance of this trans-synaptic link in normal brain function (Südhof, 2008Südhof T.C. Neuroligins and neurexins link synaptic function to cognitive disease.Nature. 2008; 455: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). NRXs are coupled to presynaptic vesicle release machinery, whereas NLs are linked to postsynaptic adaptor proteins and neurotransmitter receptors. Thus, NRX-NL pairs coordinate the organization and alignment of the pre- and postsynaptic specializations (Craig and Kang, 2007Craig A.M. Kang Y. Neurexin-neuroligin signaling in synapse development.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In humans, there are three neurexin and five neuroligin genes. Each neurexin gene produces two isoforms, the long NRXα and the short NRXβ. β-isoforms interact strongly with NLs, whereas α-isoforms have weak affinity toward NLs, in particular NL1 with a B-splice site insertion (NL1B) (Boucard et al., 2005Boucard A.A.

NRXα and NL1B isoforms are far more abundantly expressed in the brain (Schreiner et al., 2015Schreiner D. Simicevic J. Ahrné E. Schmidt A. Scheiffele P. Quantitative isoform-profiling of highly diversified recognition molecules.eLife. 2015; 4: e07794Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recruitment of NRXαs, but not NRXβs, is key for the rapid induction of presynaptic release machinery at the sites of new axo-dendritic contacts (Lee et al., 2010Lee H. Dean C. Isacoff E. Alternative splicing of neuroligin regulates the rate of presynaptic differentiation.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 11435-11446Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and NL1 is critical for recruiting NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDAR) to excitatory synapses (Budreck et al., 2013Budreck E.C. Kwon O.B. Jung J.H. Baudouin S. Thommen A. Kim H.S. Fukazawa Y. Harada H. Tabuchi K.

These observations suggested the presence of synaptic linkers that align postsynaptic NMDARs with presynaptic release machinery via bridging of incompatible NRXα and NL1B. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells of the brain, control synapse formation by secreting synaptogenic factors, including hevin/SPARCL1 (Kucukdereli et al., 2011Kucukdereli H. Allen N.J.

Hevin is a glycoprotein localized to the synaptic clefts of excitatory synapses (Johnston et al., 1990Johnston I.G. Paladino T. Gurd J.W. Brown I.R.

Downregulation of hevin has been reported in neurological disorders such as autism and depression (Purcell et al., 2001Purcell A.E. Jeon O.H. Zimmerman A.W. Blue M.E. Pevsner J.

Genet. 2008; 147B: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Hevin strongly stimulates excitatory synapse formation in the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) cultures and Hevin null mice (Hevin knockout [KO]) have fewer and immature excitatory synapses at the superior colliculus (SC), the synaptic target of RGCs in vivo (Kucukdereli et al., 2011Kucukdereli H. Allen N.J. Lee A.T. Feng A. Ozlu M.I. Conatser L.M. Chakraborty C. Workman G. Weaver M. Sage E.H. et al.Control of excitatory CNS synaptogenesis by astrocyte-secreted proteins Hevin and SPARC.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: E440-E449Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the developing cortex, hevin is required for proper thalamocortical synaptogenesis and the maturation of dendritic spine structures (Risher et al., 2014Risher W.C. Patel S. Kim I.H. Uezu A. Bhagat S. Wilton D.K. Pilaz L.J. Singh Alvarado J. Calhan O.Y. Silver D.L. et al.Astrocytes refine cortical connectivity at dendritic spines.eLife. 2014; 3https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04047Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Despite hevin’s fundamental role in excitatory synapse development in rodents and its potential association with neurological disorders in humans, how hevin induces synaptogenesis is unknown. Here, we show that hevin organizes pre- and postsynaptic specializations and induces thalamocortical synaptogenesis by bridging NRX1α and NL1. Moreover, in the developing visual cortex, astrocyte-secreted hevin is required for the plasticity of thalamocortical connections. These results reveal that astrocytes alter the trans-synaptic interactions between NLs and NRXs via hevin and thus modulate the formation and plasticity of excitatory synapses. Because hevin (SPARCL1), NRX1α (NRXN1), and NL1 (NLGN1) are all genetically linked to neurological disorders, our results also provide mechanistic insights into how mutations in these genes may lead to synaptic dysfunction in disease. Hevin induces the formation of ultrastructurally normal, but postsynaptically silent synapses (i.e., lacking AMPA receptors) between RGCs (Kucukdereli et al., 2011Kucukdereli H. Allen N.J. Lee A.T. Feng A. Ozlu M.I. Conatser L.M. Chakraborty C. Workman G. Weaver M. Sage E.H. et al.Control of excitatory CNS synaptogenesis by astrocyte-secreted proteins Hevin and SPARC.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: E440-E449Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, hevin-induced synapses are presynaptically active as shown by live staining with luminal synaptotagmin antibody (Figures S1A and S1B). Moreover, hevin strongly enhances NMDA currents in autaptic RGC cultures suggesting it potentiates NMDA receptor function (Figures S1C–S1K). Because hevin affects both pre- and postsynapses in vitro and in vivo we postulated that hevin organizes pre- and postsynaptic specializations. To determine whether hevin organizes presynaptic structures, we utilized a “hemisynapse” assay (Scheiffele et al., 2000Scheiffele P. Fan J. Choih J. Fetter R. Serafini T. Neuroligin expressed in nonneuronal cells triggers presynaptic development in contacting axons.Cell. 2000; 101: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). We engineered a membrane-anchored hevin construct (Hevin-TM), expressed it in HEK293 cells, and then co-cultured these cells with purified RGCs (Figures 1A–1D ). Hevin-TM strongly induced clustering of presynaptic synapsin-1 puncta onto HEK293 cells (Figures 1C and 1D), but two negative controls: cells expressing (1) cytoplasmic mCherry or (2) alkaline phosphatase tethered to the cell membrane with the same TM-anchor did not (AP-TM; Figures 1A–1D). Hevin has two distinct domains: a unique N-terminal acidic region followed by a secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteines (SPARC) homology region (Figure 1A). Metalloprotease ADAMTS4 cleaves hevin at amino acid 350, to produce N- and C-terminal fragments, which are found in the brain at low levels (Weaver et al., 2010Weaver M.S. Workman G. Cardo-Vila M. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Sage E.H. Processing of the matricellular protein hevin in mouse brain is dependent on ADAMTS4.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5868-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We tested presynaptic clustering ability of TM-tagged N- or C-terminal hevin fragments (Hevin-N-TM [17–349], Hevin-C-TM [350–650]) and found that neither induces synapsin-1 clustering onto HEK293 cells (Figures 1A–1D). Our findings show that hevin organizes presynaptic specializations and cleavage of hevin at amino acid 350 impairs its ability to organize presynapses. Next, we tested whether hevin organizes postsynaptic specializations. We cultured RGCs with magnetic beads coated with Fc-tagged full-length hevin or hevin-truncation constructs (Figures 1E and 1F). Hevin-Fc beads efficiently bound to neuronal processes and significantly induced homer-1 clustering compared to Fc-coated control beads (Figures 1G–1I). Deletion of the C terminus of hevin eliminated these functions (Hevin-N-Fc). In contrast, the C-terminal region of hevin (Fc-Hevin-C) efficiently bound to RGCs and strongly clustered homer-1 (Figures 1G–1I). These results show that the C terminus of hevin is sufficient to interact with neuronal processes and induce postsynaptic clustering. Collectively, our results show that hevin organizes both pre- and postsynaptic specializations. To further understand the mechanism of hevin-induced synapse formation, we tested whether hevin truncation constructs (Figure 1J) were synaptogenic in RGC cultures. RGCs, cultured as a pure neuronal population, form few synapses as determined by the co-localization of pre- and postsynaptic markers (e.g., bassoon and homer-1, respectively; Figure 1K). Addition of hevin induces an ∼3-fold increase in synapse number (Figure 1K, arrows). Even though the C terminus of hevin (Hevin-C) organizes postsynaptic specializations (Figures 1G–1I), neither Hevin-C alone, nor the co-application of Hevin-N and Hevin-C together mimicked full-length hevin’s synaptogenic effect (Figure 1K). These data suggest that simultaneous organization of pre- and postsynaptic sites by hevin is required for its synaptogenic effect. Similar to hevin, presynaptic NRXs and postsynaptic NLs organize pre- and postsynaptic specializations, respectively (Graf et al., 2004Graf E.R. Zhang X. Jin S.X. Linhoff M.W. Craig A.M. Neurexins induce differentiation of GABA and glutamate postsynaptic specializations via neuroligins.Cell. 2004; 119: 1013-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, Scheiffele et al., 2000Scheiffele P.

Neuroligin expressed in nonneuronal cells triggers presynaptic development in contacting axons.Cell. 2000; 101: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulated that hevin interacts with these receptors to induce synapse formation. There are four neuroligins (NL1–NL4) in rodents. We found that hevin co-immunoprecipitates (coIP) with NL1, NL2, and NL3 (Figure 2A). Knockdown of NLs 1–3 in RGCs using small hairpin RNAs (shRNA) completely abolished hevin-induced synaptogenesis in vitro, which was rescued by co-expression of shRNA-resistant human NL3 (hNL3; Figures 2B, 2C, and S2A). Individual knockdown of NLs 1–3 or in dual combinations all significantly reduced hevin-induced synaptogenesis (Figure S2B). These results show that NLs 1–3 are required for hevin-induced synapse formation in vitro.Figure S2NLs and NRX1α Are Receptors for Hevin, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Western blot images showing shRNA targeted against NL1 and NL2 efficiently downregulated the expression of HA-NL1 and HA-NL2 respectively, compared to shControl in HEK293 lysates.

(Right) Western blot analysis of HEK293 lysates expressing NRX1-3α or NRX1β constructs to demonstrate the isoform specificity of the anti-NRX1 antibodies used in our experiments in Figures 2I–2K. We next tested whether hevin interacts with NRX1 isoforms (Figure 2D). We found that hevin coIP specifically with long NRX1α but not with short NRX1β (Figure 2E). Hevin did not coIP with NRX2α and only weakly interacted with NRX3α (Figure S2C), suggesting that hevin mainly interacts with NRX1α. Additionally, the C-terminal domain of hevin, which interacts with NL1, had diminished interactions with NRX1α (Figure 2F). We found that hevin interacts in solution with Fc-tagged soluble NRX1α extracellular domain (ECD) (Figures S2D–S2F). Bath application of the soluble NRX1α-Fc with hevin at 1:1 molar ratio blocked hevin-induced synaptogenesis in vitro (Figures 2G and 2H), suggesting that the NRX1α-hevin interaction is important for hevin’s synaptogenic function. Next, we tested whether antibodies against NRX1 ECD (Figures 2I and S2G) can block hevin-induced synapse formation. A mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing α and β NRX1 or a rabbit polyclonal antibody against an epitope specific for NRX1α blocked hevin-induced synaptogenesis (Figures 2J and 2K). In contrast, a NRX1β-specific monoclonal antibody did not block hevin-induced synaptogenesis (Figures 2J and 2K). Taken together, these data indicate that NRX1α is the presynaptic receptor for hevin’s synaptogenic function. Cleavage of hevin at amino acid 350 eliminates its synaptogenic function (Figure 1K). Thus, we postulated that a region surrounding the cleavage site is critical for hevin’s synaptogenic interactions. Consistent with this, a hevin truncation construct spanning amino acids 17–459 (Hevin-N/FS+) induced synapse formation (Figures 3A and 3B ) and interacted efficiently with NRX1α and NL1 (Figure S3A). In contrast, non-synaptogenic Hevin-N (Figure 1K) did not interact with NRX1α and weakly interacted with NL1B (Figure S3A). Moreover, a hevin fragment (17–417) lacking the follistatin-like domain (Hevin-N/ΔFS) was synaptogenic only at higher concentrations (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3B) and interacted weakly with NRX1α and NL1B (Figure S3A). Taken together, these data show that the first 459 amino acids of hevin mediate its synaptogenic activity and interact with both NRX1α and NL1B efficiently. The follistatin-like domain of hevin is not essential for its synaptogenic function, but plays a role in strengthening hevin-receptor interactions. Our findings also show that the region around amino acids 350–417 of hevin is critical for its synaptogenic activity.Figure S3Synaptogenic Activity of Hevin Truncation Constructs, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Western blot analysis of IP fractions to determine the interactions between hevin truncation constructs and the synaptic hevin receptors (NRX1α and NL1).

Full length hevin and Hevin-ΔA are synaptogenic at the optimum concentration (40-80nM). It is important to note that hevin’s synaptogenic effect is occluded at high hevin (> 100nM) concentrations.

Some of the putative binding sites are shown by boxed area within rows A, D and E. While boxed area A shows specific interaction with NRX1α, area D and E interacts with both NRX1α- and NL1B-ECD-Fc. (D) Quantification of the normalized binding affinity of NRX1α-Fc (in red bars) and NL1B-Fc (in green bars) corresponding to each peptide of hevin on array. These quantifications were made by measuring the signal intensity at each peptide and by subtracting the intensity of the Fc-only array peptide corresponding to the same spot. Based on the above interaction pattern three putative sites of hevin were chosen to create deletion mutants: Hevin-ΔDE (lacking a.a 351-440); Hevin-ΔD (lacking a.a 351-372); Hevin-ΔA (lacking a.a 88-115). (E) Quantification of dose response analyses of the synaptogenic effect of hevin and hevin deletion mutants. Full length hevin and Hevin-ΔA are synaptogenic at the optimum concentration (40-80nM). It is important to note that hevin’s synaptogenic effect is occluded at high hevin (> 100nM) concentrations. Hevin-ΔD or Hevin-ΔDE is not synaptogenic even at higher doses. n > 17 cells/condition, ∗p < 0.05, one way ANOVA followed by Fisher’s LSD Post hoc test, error bars represent ± SEM. Next, we mapped two putative NRX1α and NL1B interaction sites within amino acids 350–440 of hevin by using a peptide array (Figures S3C and S3D). We named these sites as D and E, based on their location on the arrays (Figure S3C). We produced three hevin-deletion mutants: (1) Hevin-ΔDE (lacking 351–440), (2) Hevin-ΔD (lacking 351–372), and (3) Hevin-ΔA (lacking 88–115, removing another putative interaction site for NRX1α) (Figure 3C and S3D). We found that Hevin-ΔA was synaptogenic like hevin; however, Hevin-ΔD and Hevin-ΔDE did not induce synapse formation in vitro (Figure 3D) even at higher concentrations (Figure S3E). This result shows that the putative NRX1α and NL1B interaction sites within 351–440 are critical for hevin’s synaptogenic function. Consistent with this, a rat monoclonal antibody against an epitope within amino acids 368–419 of hevin (anti-hevin 12:54) blocked hevin’s synaptogenic function, when co-applied to RGCs with hevin (Figures 3E–3G). Another rat anti-hevin antibody (12:155), with epitopes within the N-terminal acidic domain of hevin (epitopes: 117–123 and 245–251, Figures 3E–3G) did not block hevin-induced synaptogenesis. Collectively, these results show that a region at the cusp of hevin’s N- and C-terminal domains is critical for hevin’s synaptogenic function. NRX1α interacts strongly with the A-site containing NL1, but weakly with the B-site containing splice variant, NL1B (Chih et al., 2006Chih B. Gollan L. Scheiffele P.

https://openalex.org/W2237639303,"Filoviruses, including Ebola and Marburg, cause fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and primates. Understanding how these viruses enter host cells could help to develop effective therapeutics. An endosomal protein, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), has been identified as a necessary entry receptor for this process, and priming of the viral glycoprotein (GP) to a fusion-competent state is a prerequisite for NPC1 binding. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of the primed GP (GPcl) of Ebola virus bound to domain C of NPC1 (NPC1-C) at a resolution of 2.3 Å. NPC1-C utilizes two protruding loops to engage a hydrophobic cavity on head of GPcl. Upon enzymatic cleavage and NPC1-C binding, conformational change in the GPcl further affects the state of the internal fusion loop, triggering membrane fusion. Our data therefore provide structural insights into filovirus entry in the late endosome and the molecular basis for design of therapeutic inhibitors of viral entry."
https://openalex.org/W2237583164,"Intercellular communication between parasites and with host cells provides mechanisms for parasite development, immune evasion, and disease pathology. Bloodstream African trypanosomes produce membranous nanotubes that originate from the flagellar membrane and disassociate into free extracellular vesicles (EVs). Trypanosome EVs contain several flagellar proteins that contribute to virulence, and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense EVs contain the serum resistance-associated protein (SRA) necessary for human infectivity. T. b. rhodesiense EVs transfer SRA to non-human infectious trypanosomes, allowing evasion of human innate immunity. Trypanosome EVs can also fuse with mammalian erythrocytes, resulting in rapid erythrocyte clearance and anemia. These data indicate that trypanosome EVs are organelles mediating non-hereditary virulence factor transfer and causing host erythrocyte remodeling, inducing anemia."
https://openalex.org/W2234093367,"Although a number of repair strategies have been shown to promote axon outgrowth following neuronal injury in the mammalian CNS, it remains unclear whether regenerated axons establish functional synapses and support behavior. Here, in both juvenile and adult mice, we show that either PTEN and SOCS3 co-deletion, or co-overexpression of osteopontin (OPN)/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)/ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), induces regrowth of retinal axons and formation of functional synapses in the superior colliculus (SC) but not significant recovery of visual function. Further analyses suggest that regenerated axons fail to conduct action potentials from the eye to the SC due to lack of myelination. Consistent with this idea, administration of voltage-gated potassium channel blockers restores conduction and results in increased visual acuity. Thus, enhancing both regeneration and conduction effectively improves function after retinal axon injury."
https://openalex.org/W2239238081,"Here, we present FissionNet, a proteome-wide binary protein interactome for S. pombe, comprising 2,278 high-quality interactions, of which ∼ 50% were previously not reported in any species. FissionNet unravels previously unreported interactions implicated in processes such as gene silencing and pre-mRNA splicing. We developed a rigorous network comparison framework that accounts for assay sensitivity and specificity, revealing extensive species-specific network rewiring between fission yeast, budding yeast, and human. Surprisingly, although genes are better conserved between the yeasts, S. pombe interactions are significantly better conserved in human than in S. cerevisiae. Our framework also reveals that different modes of gene duplication influence the extent to which paralogous proteins are functionally repurposed. Finally, cross-species interactome mapping demonstrates that coevolution of interacting proteins is remarkably prevalent, a result with important implications for studying human disease in model organisms. Overall, FissionNet is a valuable resource for understanding protein functions and their evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2239565179,"Functionally Graded Scaffolds (FGSs) are porous biomaterials where porosity changes in space with a specific gradient. In spite of their wide use in bone tissue engineering, possible models that relate the scaffold gradient to the mechanical and biological requirements for the regeneration of the bony tissue are currently missing. In this study we attempt to bridge the gap by developing a mechanobiology-based optimization algorithm aimed to determine the optimal graded porosity distribution in FGSs. The algorithm combines the parametric finite element model of a FGS, a computational mechano-regulation model and a numerical optimization routine. For assigned boundary and loading conditions, the algorithm builds iteratively different scaffold geometry configurations with different porosity distributions until the best microstructure geometry is reached, i.e. the geometry that allows the amount of bone formation to be maximized. We tested different porosity distribution laws, loading conditions and scaffold Young’s modulus values. For each combination of these variables, the explicit equation of the porosity distribution law–i.e the law that describes the pore dimensions in function of the spatial coordinates–was determined that allows the highest amounts of bone to be generated. The results show that the loading conditions affect significantly the optimal porosity distribution. For a pure compression loading, it was found that the pore dimensions are almost constant throughout the entire scaffold and using a FGS allows the formation of amounts of bone slightly larger than those obtainable with a homogeneous porosity scaffold. For a pure shear loading, instead, FGSs allow to significantly increase the bone formation compared to a homogeneous porosity scaffolds. Although experimental data is still necessary to properly relate the mechanical/biological environment to the scaffold microstructure, this model represents an important step towards optimizing geometry of functionally graded scaffolds based on mechanobiological criteria."
https://openalex.org/W2239255349,"Gigantism-very large body size-is an ecologically important trait associated with competitive superiority. Although it has been studied in particular cases, the general conditions for the evolution and maintenance of gigantism remain obscure. I compiled sizes and dates for the largest species in 3 terrestrial and 7 marine trophic and habitat categories of animals from throughout the Phanerozoic. The largest species (global giants) in all categories are of post-Paleozoic age. Gigantism at this level appeared tens to hundreds of millions of years after mass extinctions and long after the origins of clades in which it evolved. Marine gigantism correlates with high planktic or seafloor productivity, but on land the correspondence between productivity and gigantism is weak at best. All global giants are aerobically active animals, not gentle giants with low metabolic demands. Oxygen concentration in the atmosphere correlates with gigantism in the Paleozoic but not thereafter, likely because of the elaboration of efficient gas-exchange systems in clades containing giants. Although temperature and habitat size are important in the evolution of very large size in some cases, the most important (and rare) enabling circumstance is a highly developed ecological infrastructure in which essential resources are abundant and effectively recycled and reused, permitting activity levels to increase and setting the stage for gigantic animals to evolve. Gigantism as a hallmark of competitive superiority appears to have lost its luster on land after the Mesozoic in favor of alternative means of achieving dominance, especially including social organization and coordinated food-gathering."

At 6 months, seizure remission was observed in 73.2% of the patients, although four patients died during hospitalization. Rituximab was used as a second-line immunotherapy in 12 patients who continued to have seizures despite the initial immunotherapy, and additional seizure remission was achieved in 66.6% of them. In particular, those who exhibited partial response to the initial immunotherapy had a better seizure outcome after rituximab, with low adverse events.AE frequently presented as seizure, but only 18.9% of the living patients suffered from seizure at 6 months after immunotherapy.

Eligible participants aged 15 years and above were screened for TB symptoms, had a chest x-ray (CXR) performed and were offered an HIV test. Participants with TB symptoms and/or CXR abnormality underwent an in-depth interview and submitted one spot- and one morning sputum sample for smear microscopy and liquid culture. Digital data collection methods were used throughout the process.Of the 98,458 individuals who were enumerated, 54,830 (55.7%) were eligible to participate, and 46,099 (84.1%) participated. Of those who participated, 45,633/46,099 (99%) were screened by both symptom assessment and chest x-ray, while 466/46,099 (1.01%) were screened by interview only. 6,708 (14.6%) were eligible to submit sputum and 6,154/6,708 (91.7%) of them submitted at least one specimen for examination.

https://openalex.org/W2239292917,"Clinical evidence has shown that physical exercise during pregnancy may alter brain development and improve cognitive function of offspring. However, the mechanisms through which maternal exercise might promote such effects are not well understood. The present study examined levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and absolute cell numbers in the hippocampal formation and cerebral cortex of rat pups born from mothers exercised during pregnancy. Additionally, we evaluated the cognitive abilities of adult offspring in different behavioral paradigms (exploratory activity and habituation in open field tests, spatial memory in a water maze test, and aversive memory in a step-down inhibitory avoidance task). Results showed that maternal exercise during pregnancy increased BDNF levels and absolute numbers of neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the hippocampal formation of offspring. No differences in BDNF levels or cell numbers were detected in the cerebral cortex. It was also observed that offspring from exercised mothers exhibited better cognitive performance in nonassociative (habituation) and associative (spatial learning) mnemonic tasks than did offspring from sedentary mothers. Our findings indicate that maternal exercise during pregnancy enhances offspring cognitive function (habituation behavior and spatial learning) and increases BDNF levels and cell numbers in the hippocampal formation of offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2243694148,"Our aim was to evaluate the association between the expression and the polymorphism of TLR4/NF-κB pathways and colon cancer. TLR4 (rs4986790, rs10759932, rs10759931 and rs2770150) were genotyped in blood samples from Colorectal patients and healthy controls. TLR4 and cytokines inflammatory expression were evaluated by real time PCR on 40 matching normal and colon tissues and the protein level by Immunohistochemistry. The high level of TLR4 expression in colon cancer tissues is mainly due to infections by bacteria in the human colon and leads to induction of an acute secretion of inflammatory cytokines mediated by NF-κB. Also, we report here a clear evidence for an association between TLR4 rs10759931 polymorphism (OR = 0.086, CI: 0.04-0.18, P = <0.00001). This polymorphism affects the entire population without being specific to either gender or to any age group. In contrast, the rs2770150 is associated with colon cancer in women aged over 50 years and is closely linked with the decreased levels of female sex hormones during the post-menopausal period (OR = 0.188, CI: 0.074-0.48, P = <0.00084). rs10759932 and rs4986790 appear to have any association with colon cancer.

A similar method could be used to create hybrid AdESCs of other distantly related species. Interspecific hybrid organisms contain genetic information of different species and have the potential to develop traits superior to either parent, a phenomenon called hybrid vigor (Swanson-Wagner et al., 2006Swanson-Wagner R.A. Jia Y. DeCook R. Borsuk L.A. Nettleton D. Schnable P.S. All possible modes of gene action are observed in a global comparison of gene expression in a maize F1 hybrid and its inbred parents.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 6805-6810Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and thus have been applied extensively in agriculture, especially for crops. Interspecific hybrids are also great models for studying basic biological questions related to speciation and gene expression regulation due to the following reasons. First, the heterozygous genetic background and the unique traits of hybrids allow researchers to identify genes related to traits with cross-species differences more easily, which could facilitate the identification of speciation-related genes and mechanisms (Mihola et al., 2009Mihola O. Trachtulec Z. Vlcek C. Schimenti J.C. Forejt J.

Second, interspecies hybrids provide a unique system for studying mechanisms underlying X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in mammals (Carrel and Willard, 1999Carrel L. Willard H.F. Heterogeneous gene expression from the inactive X chromosome: an X-linked gene that escapes X inactivation in some human cell lines but is inactivated in others.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

X-inactivation profile reveals extensive variability in X-linked gene expression in females.Nature. 2005; 434: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar), as it is much easier to trace the activity of the X chromosome from each parent in female hybrid cells or organisms than in the homozygous species. Third, hybrid cells have allelic difference in many genomic loci, and thus can serve as a unique and convenient system to identify species-specific gene regulatory elements and to investigate the differences of gene regulatory networks between species (Boyle et al., 2014Boyle A.P.

Nine cell lines, including five RM-AdESC lines and four MR-AdESC lines, were used in our studies (Tables S1 and S2).Figure S1Derivation of Stable Mouse-Rat Interspecies AdESCs, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Schematic overview of the derivation procedure of MR-AdESCs.

Both the RM-AdESCs and MR-AdESCs showed typical dome-shaped colony morphology and expressed the GFP and RFP markers (Figure 1B), with the presence of parental species-specific DNA sequences (Figure 1C). Each AdESC contained 20 mouse chromosomes and 21 rat chromosomes, representing an allodiploid genome composition (Figures 1D and 1E). AdESCs at both early (passage 5) and late passages (passages 19–25) maintained stable allodiploid genomes (Figure 1F). No consistent structural variations were detected in the genomes of the interspecific AdESCs (RM1-1 and MR1-1) within the detection range of the mouse and rat comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays, suggesting the genome integrity of the AdESCs (Figures 1G and S1B). Comparable and constant amounts of both mouse and rat mitochondrial genomes were detected in the early and late passages as well as in in-vitro-differentiated cells of six AdESC lines (Figure S1C; Wanet et al., 2015Wanet A. Arnould T. Najimi M. Renard P. Connecting mitochondria, metabolism, and stem cell fate.Stem Cells Dev. 2015; 24: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), indicating the stable persistence of both mouse and rat mitochondrial genomes in the hybrid AdESCs. The AdESCs exhibited positive signals of alkaline phosphatase staining (Figure S1D), and they expressed pluripotent marker genes such as Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and SSEA-1 (Figures S1E and S1F). Notably, both the mouse and rat transcripts of pluripotent marker genes could be detected with species-specific primers, confirming the presence and expression of both mouse and rat genomes in the AdESCs (Figures S1G and S1H). We used various methods to examine the pluripotency levels of the AdESCs. In vitro experiments showed that the AdESCs could form embryoid bodies (EBs) (Figure S2A) and further differentiate into multiple somatic cell types, including neural cells with typical neural rosette structures and beating cardiomyocyte-like cells (Figure S2B). Marker genes representing all three germ layers were detected among these differentiated cells (Figures S2C and S2D). After subcutaneous injection into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, the AdESCs could form teratomas containing cells of all three germ layers (Figure 2A).Figure 2In Vitro and In Vivo Developmental Potential of AdESCsShow full caption(A) Teratoma formation of RM1-1 AdESCs.

See also Figure S2 and Table S1. Next we injected the AdESCs into mouse (CD-1 strain with white coat color) or rat (F344 strain with white coat color) blastocysts to test their ability to form chimeras. Expression of GFP and RFP was observed in the dissected chimeric embryos at both embryonic day (E)13.5 and E19.5 (full-term stage) (Figure 2B), suggesting the contribution of AdESCs into chimeric embryos. The coat-color chimerism and the presence of GFP/RFP expression in dissected organs (heart, lung, and kidney) of adult chimeras (Figures 2C and S2E; Table S1) demonstrated that the AdESCs had broad in vivo differentiation potential and could produce adult mouse and rat chimeras. To examine the genome stability of differentiated cells from the AdESCs, we isolated AdESC-derived GFP-positive cells from the adult chimeric organs and analyzed their DNA content by FACS. The DNA content curves of the GFP-positive cells almost overlapped with those of the GFP-negative ones (Figure 2D), indicating the maintenance of the allodiploid genome in these cells without massive chromosome loss or gain. To further assess the genome integrity of the differentiated cells, we performed single-cell whole-genome sequencing of three GFP/RFP double-positive AdESC-derived somatic cells isolated from the testis tissue of male chimeric mouse. Sequencing analysis revealed that all the mouse and rat chromosomes were uniformly presented in these somatic cells, and no consistent structural variations were detected, indicating the maintenance of genome integrity in the AdESC-derived cells (Figures 2E and S2F). Notably, using the patch-clamp technique, normal action potentials were recorded from the AdESC-derived neurons, implying that they were functional (Figures S2G and S2H). Collectively, these results demonstrated that the interspecific AdESCs had the ability to differentiate into all three germ layers both in vitro and in vivo and could maintain genome integrity during differentiation. As the genome of each AdESC was composed of the 20 mouse chromosomes plus the 21 rat chromosomes, whether AdESCs with such an odd number of chromosomes were capable of producing normal germ cells is an intriguing question for developmental biology. To determine the germline differentiation potential of AdESCs, we traced the GFP/RFP double-positive cells in the gonads of chimeric mice at different developmental stages, including E13.5, E15.5, E18.5, post-natal day (P)1, and P7. As the haploid ESCs that were used to produce AdESCs both lacked the Y chromosome, the AdESCs should not have been able to contribute to male sex organs. Thus, we mainly analyzed the cell composition of chimeric ovaries. An abundant presence of GFP/RFP-positive cells was detected in ovaries dissected from E13.5, E15.5, and E18.5 chimeric embryos and P7 pups (Figures 2F and S2I), indicating that the AdESCs could contribute massively into ovaries. Notably, a proportion of these GFP-positive (GFP+) cells also expressed the germ cell-specific marker gene VASA (GFP+ VASA+/VASA+: 3.3% at E13.5, 1.5% at E15.5, and 1.7% at E18.5) (Figures 2G and 2H). In addition, the expression of SCP3, a marker gene expressed in germ cells for synaptonemal complex formation, also was detected in GFP+ cells at E15.5 and E18.5. The co-expression of GFP and SCP3 in the AdESC-derived germ cells indicated their ability to differentiate into synapsis-stage germ cells (Figures 2G and S2J). However, the GFP and VASA double-positive cells decreased dramatically in ovaries of P1 pups and were not detected in the ovaries of P7 pups (GFP+ VASA+/VASA+: 0.2% at P1 and 0% at P7) (Figures 2G and 2H). We used five female chimeric mice and five female chimeric rats to mate with wild-type males for more than 1 year, but we failed to detect any GFP expression in more than 300 live-born offspring. Taken together, these observations indicated that the AdESCs could differentiate into early-stage germ cells in both mouse ovaries, yet could not survive through meiosis to form mature oocytes. The gene expression patterns of AdESCs were determined by the paired-end RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) method. To investigate the parental influence on gene expression, AdESCs of reciprocal hybridization (two RM-AdESC lines and two MR-AdESC lines) as well as two mouse ESC (mESC) lines and two rat ESC (rESC) lines were included in the sequencing. To discriminate transcripts with high-sequence homology between mouse and rat, we used a stringent mapping strategy to allow only one nucleotide mismatch per sequencing read. Approximately 94% of total reads had genomic matches using the above criterion. Among them, about 42% were only mapped to the mouse genome, 40% were only mapped to the rat genome, and the rest could be mapped to both genomes (Figure S3A). These uniquely mapped reads represented a total of 13,926 genes with one-to-one ortholog between the mouse and rat. To avoid the influence of reads with ambiguous genomic origins, we used an adjusted fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mappable fragments (aFPKM) value, which excludes the regions covered by reads mapped to both genomes, to quantify the gene transcription levels (Figures S3B and S3C; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The gene expression profiles of RM-AdESCs and MR-AdESCs exhibited a high correlation (RM1-1 versus MR1-1: Spearman r = 0.977) (Figures 3A and S3D), indicating that the reciprocal fusion had a negligible effect on gene expression. The Spearman correlation coefficient of gene expression profiles between mESCs and rESCs was only 0.834 (Figure S3E), whereas that between AdESCs and either mESCs or rESCs was higher than 0.91 (Figures 3B and S3F); moreover, the correlation was even higher between the gene expression profiles of AdESCs and the mean gene expression profiles of mESCs and rESCs (Figures 3C and S3G), suggesting that the majority of genes in AdESCs had an additive expression (mid-parent). We further examined the expression of 2,730 genes (19.60% of total genes) with differential expression (differentially expressed genes, DEGs) between mouse and rat ESCs. In the AdESCs, the majority of the DEGs had an expression value between those of rESCs and mESCs (Figure 3D). Of these, about 70% of genes (1,741 genes in RM-AdESCs and 2,071 genes in MR-AdESCs) exhibited additive expression in AdESCs, and the rest (989 genes in RM-AdESCs and 659 genes in MR-AdESCs) exhibited non-additive expression (non-additive genes, NAGs) (Figure S3H). No chromosome preference or clustered genomic localization pattern was observed among these NAGs. The expression level of NAGs in hybrids was either similar to that in the parent with higher gene expression (high-parent expression) or similar to that in the parent with lower gene expression (low-parent expression). Unexpectedly, the majority of these NAGs had either high-parent (306 genes) or low-parent (228 genes) expression to mouse; only 13 genes had high-parent expression and one gene had low-parent expression to rat (Figures 3E and S3H). Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of the NAGs revealed that genes with low-parent expression to mouse were mainly enriched in development-associated functions, such as mesoderm development and gastrulation; whereas genes with high-parent expression to mouse were enriched in the extracellular matrix organization and metabolic processes (Figure 3F, p < 0.01). As expected, 94% of the genes with a mid-parent expression pattern were due to the equal allelic expression contribution, whereas 40% of NAGs were caused by allelic-biased expression of DEGs between mESCs and rESCs. The hybrid nature of AdESCs confers it advantages to study the regulatory mechanisms of XCI, as the origin of the silenced X chromosome is traced easily in the interspecific hybrid cells, but not in the within-species diploid ones. To investigate whether the mouse and rat X chromosomes were randomly inactivated in AdESC-derived allodiploid somatic cells, we isolated AdESC-derived embryonic fibroblasts (EFs) from the AdESC-mouse chimeras and examined their gene expression profile using the bulk RNA-seq technology. Unexpectedly, nearly all X-linked transcripts of the sequenced cells were mapped to the rat X chromosome; however, transcripts derived from the Xist gene, which was expressed from the inactivated X chromosome (Xi) to induce silencing, was mapped exclusively to the mouse X chromosome (Figure 4A). These results indicated that the mouse X chromosome was inactivated in the AdESC-"
https://openalex.org/W2418200317,"Most patients with bacterial infections suffer from fever and various pains that require complex treatments with antibiotics, antipyretics, and analgaesics. The most common drugs used to relieve these symptoms are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are not typically considered antibiotics. Here, we investigate the effects of NSAIDs on bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics and the modulation of bacterial efflux pumps.The activity of 12 NSAID active substances, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and eight relevant medicinal products was analyzed with or without pump inhibitors against 89 strains of Gram-negative rods by determining the MICs. Furthermore, the effects of NSAIDs on the susceptibility of clinical strains to antimicrobial agents with or without PAβN (Phe-Arg-β-naphtylamide) were measured.The MICs of diclofenac, mefenamic acid, ibuprofen, and naproxen, in the presence of PAβN, were significantly (≥4-fold) reduced, decreasing to 25-1600 mg/L, against the majority of the studied strains. In the case of acetylsalicylic acid only for 5 and 7 out of 12 strains of P. mirabilis and E. coli, respectively, a 4-fold increase in susceptibility in the presence of PAβN was observed. The presence of Aspirin resulted in a 4-fold increase in the MIC of ofloxacin against only two strains of E. coli among 48 tested clinical strains, which included species such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. maltophilia. Besides, the medicinal products containing the following NSAIDs, diclofenac, mefenamic acid, ibuprofen, and naproxen, did not cause the decrease of clinical strains' susceptibility to antibiotics.The effects of PAβN on the susceptibility of bacteria to NSAIDs indicate that some NSAIDs are substrates for efflux pumps in Gram-negative rods. Morever, Aspirin probably induced efflux-mediated resistance to fluoroquinolones in a few E. coli strains."
https://openalex.org/W2239401977,"Impaired function of NPC1 or NPC2 lysosomal proteins leads to the intracellular accumulation of unesterified cholesterol, the primary defect underlying Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease. In addition, glycosphingolipids (GSLs) accumulate in lysosomes as well. Intralysosomal lipid accumulation triggers the activation of a set of genes, including potential biomarkers. Transcript levels of Gpnmb have been shown to be elevated in various tissues of an NPC mouse model. We speculated that Gpnmb could serve as a marker for visceral lipid accumulation in NPC disease. We report that Gpnmb expression is increased at protein level in macrophages in the viscera of Npc1nih/nih mice. Interestingly, soluble Gpnmb was also found to be increased in murine and NPC patient plasma. Exposure of RAW264.7 macrophages to the NPC-phenotype-inducing drug U18666A also upregulated Gpnmb expression. Inhibition of GSL synthesis with the glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitor N-butyl-1-deoxynojirimycin prevented U18666A-induced Gpnmb induction and secretion. In summary, we show that Gpnmb is upregulated in NPC mice and patients, most likely due to GSL accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2245024984,"Body Area Networks (BANs) consist of various sensors which gather patient’s vital signs and deliver them to doctors. One of the most significant challenges faced, is the design of an energy-efficient next hop selection algorithm to satisfy Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for different healthcare applications. In this paper, a novel efficient next hop selection algorithm is proposed in multi-hop BANs. This algorithm uses the minimum hop count and a link cost function jointly in each node to choose the best next hop node. The link cost function includes the residual energy, free buffer size, and the link reliability of the neighboring nodes, which is used to balance the energy consumption and to satisfy QoS requirements in terms of end to end delay and reliability. Extensive simulation experiments were performed to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm using the NS-2 simulator. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm provides significant improvement in terms of energy consumption, number of packets forwarded, end to end delay and packet delivery ratio compared to the existing routing protocol."
https://openalex.org/W2236784870,"Background The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has infected at least 27,443 individuals and killed 11,207, based on data until 24 June, 2015, released by the World Health Organization (WHO). This outbreak has been characterised by extensive geographic spread across the affected countries Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and by localized hotspots within these countries. The rapid recognition and quantitative assessment of localised areas of higher transmission can inform the optimal deployment of public health resources. Methods A variety of mathematical models have been used to estimate the evolution of this epidemic, and some have pointed out the importance of the spatial heterogeneity apparent from incidence maps. However, little is known about the district-level transmission. Given that many response decisions are taken at sub-national level, the current study aimed to investigate the spatial heterogeneity by using a different modelling framework, built on publicly available data at district level. Furthermore, we assessed whether this model could quantify the effect of intervention measures and provide predictions at a local level to guide public health action. We used a two-stage modelling approach: a) a flexible spatiotemporal growth model across all affected districts and b) a deterministic SEIR compartmental model per district whenever deemed appropriate. Findings Our estimates show substantial differences in the evolution of the outbreak in the various regions of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, illustrating the importance of monitoring the outbreak at district level. We also provide an estimate of the time-dependent district-specific effective reproduction number, as a quantitative measure to compare transmission between different districts and give input for informed decisions on control measures and resource allocation. Prediction and assessing the impact of control measures proved to be difficult without more accurate data. In conclusion, this study provides us a useful tool at district level for public health, and illustrates the importance of collecting and sharing data."
https://openalex.org/W2238908464,"The recycling of livestock manure in cropping systems is considered to enhance soil fertility and crop productivity. However, there have been no systematic long-term studies of the effects of manure application on soil and crop macro- and micro-nutrients, heavy metals, and crop yields in China, despite their great importance for sustainable crop production and food safety. Thus, we conducted field experiments in a typical cereal crop production area of the North China Plain to investigate the effects of compost manure application rates on wheat yield, as well as on the macro-/micro-nutrients and heavy metals contents of soil and wheat. We found that compost application increased the soil total N and the available K, Fe, Zn, and Mn concentrations, whereas the available P in soil was not affected, and the available Cu decreased. In general, compost application had no significant effects on the grain yield, biomass, and harvest index of winter wheat. However, during 2012 and 2013, the N concentration decreased by 9% and 18% in straw, and by 16% and 12% in grain, respectively. With compost application, the straw P concentration only increased in 2012 but the grain P generally increased, while the straw K concentration tended to decrease and the grain K concentration increased in 2013. Compost application generally increased the Fe and Zn concentrations in straw and grain, whereas the Cu and Mn concentrations decreased significantly compared with the control. The heavy metal concentrations increased at some compost application rates, but they were still within the safe range. The balances of the macro-and micro-nutrients indicated that the removal of nutrients by wheat was compensated for by the addition of compost, whereas the level of N decreased without the application of compost. The daily intake levels of micronutrients via the consumption of wheat grain were still lower than the recommended levels when sheep manure compost was applied, except for that of Mn."
https://openalex.org/W2245716180,"In the absence of a gold standard for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI), the current tests available for the diagnosis of LTBI are limited by their inability to differentiate between LTBI and active TB disease. We investigated IP-10 as a potential biomarker for LTBI among household contacts exposed to sputum positive active TB cases.Active TB cases and contacts were recruited into a cohort with six months' follow-up. Contacts were tested for LTBI using QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube (QFN) assay and the tuberculin skin test (TST). Baseline supernatants from the QFN assay of 237 contacts and 102 active TB cases were analysed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) specific and mitogen specific IP-10 responses.Contacts with LTBI (QFN+TST+) had the highest MTB specific IP-10 responses at baseline, compared to uninfected contacts (QFN-TST-) p<0.0001; and active cases, p = 0.01. Using a cut-off of 8,239 pg/ml, MTB specific IP-10 was able to diagnose LTBI with a sensitivity of 87.1% (95% CI, 76.2-94.3) and specificity of 90.9% (95% CI, 81.3-96.6). MTB specific to mitogen specific IP-10 ratio was higher in HIV negative active TB cases, compared to HIV negative latently infected contacts, p = 0.0004. Concentrations of MTB specific IP-10 were higher in contacts with TST conversion (negative at baseline, positive at 6-months) than in those that were persistently TST negative, p = 0.001.IP-10 performed well in differentiating contacts with either latent or active TB from those who were uninfected but was not able to differentiate LTBI from active disease except when MTB specific to mitogen specific ratios were used in HIV negative adults. In addition, IP-10 had the potential to diagnose 'recent TB infection' in persons classified as having LTBI using the TST. Such individuals with strong IP-10 responses would likely benefit from chemoprophylaxis."

Depression was defined by a score of 16 or over in the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). A validated 12-item Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) was used to classify participants in gender roles (Masculine, Feminine, Androgynous, and Undifferentiated) using research site medians of femininity and masculinity as cut-off points. Poisson regressions were fitted to estimate the prevalence ratios (PR) of depression for each gender role compared to the masculine role, adjusting for sex, sufficiency of income, education, marital status, self-rated health, and chronic conditions.Among men, 31.2% were androgynous, 26% were masculine, 14.4% were feminine, and 28.4% were undifferentiated; among women, the corresponding percentages were 32.7%, 14.9%, 27%, and 25.4%. Both in men and in women, depressive symptoms (CES-D≥16) were more prevalent in those endorsing the undifferentiated type, compared to masculine, feminine or androgynous groups. However, after adjusting for potential confounders, compared to the masculine group only those endorsing the androgynous role were 28% less likely to suffer from depression: PR of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55-0.93). In fully adjusted models, prevalence rates of depression were not different from masculine participants in the two other gender groups of feminine and undifferentiated.Androgynous roles were associated with lower rates of depression in older adults, independently of being a man or a woman."
https://openalex.org/W2238296078,"We compared the performance of several prediction techniques for breast cancer prognosis, based on AU-ROC performance (Area Under ROC) for different prognosis periods. The analyzed dataset contained 1,981 patients and from an initial 25 variables, the 11 most common clinical predictors were retained. We compared eight models from a wide spectrum of predictive models, namely; Generalized Linear Model (GLM), GLM-Net, Partial Least Square (PLS), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Neural Networks, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Boosted Trees. In order to compare these models, paired t-test was applied on the model performance differences obtained from data resampling. Random Forests, Boosted Trees, Partial Least Square and GLMNet have superior overall performance, however they are only slightly higher than the other models. The comparative analysis also allowed us to define a relative variable importance as the average of variable importance from the different models. Two sets of variables are identified from this analysis. The first includes number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size, cancer grade and estrogen receptor, all has an important influence on model predictability. The second set incudes variables related to histological parameters and treatment types. The short term vs long term contribution of the clinical variables are also analyzed from the comparative models. From the various cancer treatment plans, the combination of Chemo/Radio therapy leads to the largest impact on cancer prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2398165652,"Understanding determinants of the invasiveness and ecological impacts of alien species is amongst the most sought-after and urgent research questions in ecology. Several studies have shown the value of comparing the functional responses (FRs) of alien and native predators towards native prey, however, the technique is under-explored with herbivorous alien species and as a predictor of invasiveness as distinct from ecological impact. Here, in China, we conducted a mesocosm experiment to compare the FRs among three herbivorous snail species: the golden apple snail, Pomacea canaliculata, a highly invasive and high impact alien listed in “100 of the World's Worst Invasive Alien Species”; Planorbarius corneus, a non-invasive, low impact alien; and the Chinese native snail, Bellamya aeruginosa, when feeding on four locally occurring plant species. Further, by using a numerical response equation, we modelled the population dynamics of the snail consumers. For standard FR parameters, we found that the invasive and damaging alien snail had the highest “attack rates” a, shortest “handling times” h and also the highest estimated maximum feeding rates, 1/hT, whereas the native species had the lowest attack rates, longest handling times and lowest maximum feeding rates. The non-invasive, low impact alien species had consistently intermediate FR parameters. The invasive alien species had higher population growth potential than the native snail species, whilst that of the non-invasive alien species was intermediate. Thus, while the comparative FR approach has been proposed as a reliable method for predicting the ecological impacts of invasive predators, our results further suggest that comparative FRs could extend to predict the invasiveness and ecological impacts of alien herbivores and should be explored in other taxa and trophic groups to determine the general utility of the approach."
https://openalex.org/W2236613012,"Autophagy acts as a host-defense system against pathogenic microorganisms such as Group A Streptococcus (GAS). Autophagy is a membrane-mediated degradation system that is regulated by intracellular membrane trafficking regulators, including small GTPase Rab proteins. Here, we identified Rab30 as a novel regulator of GAS-containing autophagosome-like vacuoles (GcAVs). We found that Rab30, a Golgi-resident Rab, was recruited to GcAVs in response to autophagy induction by GAS infection in epithelial cells. Rab30 recruitment was dependent upon its GTPase activity. In addition, the knockdown of Rab30 expression significantly reduced GcAV formation efficiency and impaired intracellular GAS degradation. Rab30 normally functions to maintain the structural integrity of the Golgi complex, but GcAV formation occurred even when the Golgi apparatus was disrupted. Although Rab30 also colocalized with a starvation-induced autophagosome, Rab30 was not required for autophagosome formation during starvation. These results suggest that Rab30 mediates autophagy against GAS independently of its normal cellular role in the structural maintenance of the Golgi apparatus, and autophagosome biogenesis during bacterial infection involves specific Rab GTPases."

Late-season lodging is inversely related to the amount of cellulose in a unit length of the stem. Wheat is the most widely grown of all the crops globally, yet information on its CesA gene family is limited. We have identified 22 CesA genes from bread wheat, which include homoeologs from each of the three genomes, and named them as TaCesAXA, TaCesAXB or TaCesAXD, where X denotes the gene number and the last suffix stands for the respective genome. Sequence analyses of the CESA proteins from wheat and their orthologs from barley, maize, rice, and several dicot species (Arabidopsis, beet, cotton, poplar, potato, rose gum and soybean) revealed motifs unique to monocots (Poales) or dicots. Novel structural motifs CQIC and SVICEXWFA were identified, which distinguished the CESAs involved in the formation of primary and secondary cell wall (PCW and SCW) in all the species. We also identified several new motifs specific to monocots or dicots. The conserved motifs identified in this study possibly play functional roles specific to PCW or SCW formation. The new insights from this study advance our knowledge about the structure, function and evolution of the CesA family in plants in general and wheat in particular. This information will be useful in improving culm strength to reduce lodging or alter wall composition to improve biofuel production."
https://openalex.org/W2418914616,"Background As a serine/threonine protein kinase, p70S6K plays an important role in tumor cells. Evidence has revealed overexpression of p70S6K and phosphorylated p70S6K (p-p70S6K) in various tumor tissues, with these proteins identified as independent prognostic markers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we explored the role of the p70S6K specific inhibitor PF-4708671 in NSCLC. Methods Three NSCLC cell lines (A549, SK-MES-1, and NCI-H460) were treated with PF-4708671 at five different concentrations, including 0.1μM, 0.3μM, 1μM, 3μM and 10μM, and protein levels were determined by Western-blot. Then, PF-4708671’s effects were assessed both in vitro (cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, and invasion) and in vivo. Results The expression levels of p-p70S6K and the downstream effector S6 were significantly reduced by PF-4708671. Diametrically opposite, the downstream protein levels of BAD, Caspase3 and ERK had increased after treatment with PF-4708671. In addition, PF-4708671 drastically inhibited cell proliferation and invasion ability in A549, SK-MES-1 and NCI-H460 cells in vitro, causing cell cycle arrest in G0-G1 phase. Limited effects of PF-4708671 were observed on apoptosis in the three NSCLC cell lines assessed. Importantly, PF-4708671 could inhibit tumorigenesis in nude mice in vivo. Conclusion These findings demonstrated that the p70S6K specific inhibitor PF-4708671 has inhibitory effects on NSCLC tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, P70S6K should be considered a new potential therapeutic target, and PF-470867 may be used as targeted drug for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2247013533,"Pathologic changes in intracranial pressure (ICP) are commonly observed in a variety of medical conditions, including traumatic brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, and glaucoma. However, current ICP measurement techniques are invasive, requiring a lumbar puncture or surgical insertion of a cannula into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled ventricles of the brain. A potential alternative approach to ICP measurement leverages the unique anatomy of the central retinal vein, which is exposed to both intraocular pressure (IOP) and ICP as it travels inside the eye and through the optic nerve; manipulating IOP while observing changes in the natural pulsations of the central retinal vein could potentially provide an accurate, indirect measure of ICP. As a step toward implementing this technique, we describe the design, fabrication, and characterization of a system that is capable of manipulating IOP in vivo with <0.1 mmHg resolution and settling times less than 2 seconds. In vitro tests were carried out to characterize system performance. Then, as a proof of concept, we used the system to manipulate IOP in tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) while video of the retinal vessels was recorded and the caliber of a selected vein was quantified. Modulating IOP using our system elicited a rapid change in the appearance of the retinal vein of interest: IOP was lowered from 10 to 3 mmHg, and retinal vein caliber sharply increased as IOP decreased from 7 to 5 mmHg. Another important feature of this technology is its capability to measure ocular compliance and outflow facility in vivo, as demonstrated in tree shrews. Collectively, these proof-of-concept demonstrations support the utility of this system to manipulate IOP for a variety of useful applications in ocular biomechanics, and provide a framework for further study of the mechanisms of retinal venous pulsation."

In mycobacteria infection, autophagy plays an important role in innate defense mechanism and is tightly regulated by the autophagy-related proteins. Here, we show that Atg2B is involved in the regulation of mycobacteria-induced autophagy. MiR-1303, which function is not defined yet, is found to negatively regulate mycobacteria-induced Atg2B protein production, ultimately down-regulate mycobacteria-induced autophagy. MiR-1303 production is shown to be upregulated during BCG infection and its production is regulated by PI3K and NFκB. It is also demonstrated that miR-1303 targets putative target sites on Atg2B and possibly represses its translation."
https://openalex.org/W2266790068,"An important characteristic of a screening tool is its discriminant ability or the measure’s accuracy to distinguish between those with and without mental health problems. The current study examined the inter-rater agreement and screening concordance of the parent and teacher versions of SDQ at scale, subscale and item-levels, with the view of identifying the items that have the most informant discrepancies; and determining whether the concordance between parent and teacher reports on some items has the potential to influence decision making. Cross-sectional data from parent and teacher reports of the mental health functioning of a community sample of 299 students with and without disabilities from 75 different primary schools in Perth, Western Australia were analysed. The study found that: a) Intraclass correlations between parent and teacher ratings of children’s mental health using the SDQ at person level was fair on individual child level; b) The SDQ only demonstrated clinical utility when there was agreement between teacher and parent reports using the possible or 90% dichotomisation system; and c) Three individual items had positive likelihood ratio scores indicating clinical utility. Of note was the finding that the negative likelihood ratio or likelihood of disregarding the absence of a condition when both parents and teachers rate the item as absent was not significant. Taken together, these findings suggest that the SDQ is not optimised for use in community samples and that further psychometric evaluation of the SDQ in this context is clearly warranted."

However, the effect of SB-710411 on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is unclear. The present study was designed to investigate whether SB-710411 has a protective effect on myocardial I/R injury in rats and the possible mechanisms.Myocardial I/R injury was induced by occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Hemodynamic parameters, electrocardiogram (ECG), infarct size, histological alteration, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase-MB (CK-MB), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), RhoA, and the protein expressions of U-II receptor (UTR), ROCK1 and ROCK2 were evaluated. Cardiac I/R injury significantly up-regulated the expressions of UTR, ROCK1 and ROCK2 proteins in rat myocardium. SB-710411 1.0 and 2.0 μg/kg significantly reduced cardiac I/R-induced the infarct size and histological damage in rat myocardium, markedly inhibited the changes of hemodynamic parameters and the increases of ST-segment in ECG, the serum LDH and CK-MB activities and cTnI level in rats subjected to myocardial I/R injury. Furthermore, SB-710411 obviously prevented myocardial I/R-increased RhoA activity and UTR, ROCK1 and ROCK2 protein expressions.Our results indicate that cardiac I/R injury increases myocardial UTR expression, and SB-710411 has a potent protective effect on myocardial I/R injury in rats. The cardioprotection may be associated with the inhibition of UTR-RhoA/ROCK pathway."

The method provides quantitative growth data (over 200,000 measurements) and identifies contributing antimicrobial resistance and susceptibility alleles. Using multivariate analysis, we also find that subtle differences in the population responses resonate across multiple levels of functional hierarchy.

https://openalex.org/W2243113785,"To date, contemporary science has lacked a satisfactory tool for the objective expression of stress. This text thus introduces a new-thermodynamically derived-approach to stress measurement, based on entropy production in time and independent of the quality or modality of a given stressor or a combination thereof. Hereto, we propose a novel model of stress response based on thermodynamic modelling of entropy production, both in the tissues/organs and in regulatory feedbacks. Stress response is expressed in our model on the basis of stress entropic load (SEL), a variable we introduced previously; the mathematical expression of SEL, provided here for the first time, now allows us to describe the various states of a living system, including differentiating between states of health and disease. The resulting calculation of stress response regardless of the type of stressor(s) in question is thus poised to become an entirely new tool for predicting the development of a living system."
https://openalex.org/W2239264873,"Culicoides brevitarsis is a vector of the bluetongue virus (BTV), which infects sheep and cattle. It is an invasive species in Australia with an assumed Asian/South East Asian origin. Using one mitochondrial marker (i.e., part of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene) and six nuclear markers, we inferred population genetic structure and possible incursion pathways for Australian C. brevitarsis. Nine mitochondrial haplotypes, with low nucleotide sequence diversity (0.0–0.7%) among these, were identified in a sample of 70 individuals from seven sites. Both sets of markers revealed a homogeneous population structure, albeit with evidence of isolation by distance and two genetically distinct clusters distributed along a north-to-south cline. No evidence of a cryptic species complex was found. The geographical distribution of the mitochondrial haplotypes is consistent with at least two incursion pathways into Australia since the arrival of suitable livestock hosts. By contrast, 15 mitochondrial haplotypes, with up to four times greater nucleotide sequence diversity (0.0–2.9%) among these, were identified in a sample of 16 individuals of the endemic C. marksi (sampled from a site in South Australia and another in New South Wales). A phylogenetic tree inferred using the mitochondrial marker revealed that the Australian and Japanese samples of C. brevitarsis are as evolutionarily different from one another as some of the other Australian species (e.g., C. marksi, C. henryi, C. pallidothorax) are. The phylogenetic tree placed four of the species endemic to Australia (C. pallidothorax, C. bundyensis, C. marksi, C. henryi) in a clade, with a fifth such species (C. bunrooensis) sharing a common ancestor with that clade and a clade comprising two Japanese species (C. verbosus, C. kibunensis)."
https://openalex.org/W2232709588,"Objective Evaluate the effect of different exercise intensities on spontaneous physical activity energy expenditure in overweight adolescents. Methods A crossover study was developed with a control session, followed by moderate and vigorous exercise sessions, with six days of monitoring each. Twenty-four adolescents, 11–13 years old, male and overweight were selected. Spontaneous physical activity energy expenditure was assessed by accelerometers. Linear mixed effects models were used to evaluate the differences per session across time. Results Energy expenditure during the 1st hour was different between all three sessions, with averages of 82, 286 and 343 kcal to the control, moderate and vigorous sessions, respectively (p <0.001). The same pattern of difference in energy expenditure between the sessions remained after 24 hours (704 vs 970 vs 1056 kcal, p <0.001). However, energy expenditure during the six days indicates compensation from second to the sixth day, although small differences remained at the end of the 6-day period (5102 vs 5193 vs 5271 kcal, p <0.001). Conclusions A single aerobic session seems to modify the spontaneous physical activities in overweight adolescents but still keeping the vigorous session with higher total energy expenditure during the follow-up period. Despite the observed compensatory effect, the greater energy expenditure observed in both moderate and vigorous exercise sessions indicates that physical activity should be recommended to promote an increased energy expenditure in adolescents.

We aimed to develop a multidimensional geriatric prognosis index (GPI) for 3- and 5-year mortality in community-dwelling elderly and to validate the GPI in a separate hospital-based population. The GPI was constructed using data for 988 participants in the Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging (KLoSHA) and cross-validated with 1109 patients who underwent a geriatric assessment at the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH). The GPI, with a total possible score of 8, included age, gender, activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, comorbidities, mood, cognitive function, and nutritional status. During the 5-year observation period, 179 KLoSHA participants (18.1%) and 340 SNUBH patients (30.7%) died. The c-indices for 3- and 5-year mortality were 0.78 and 0.80, respectively, in the KLoSHA group and 0.73 and 0.80, respectively, in the SNUBH group. Positive linear trends were observed for GPI scores and both 3- and 5-year mortality in both groups. In conclusions, using common components of a geriatric assessment, the GPI can stratify the risk of 3- and 5-year mortality in Korean elderly people both in the community and hospital."
https://openalex.org/W2235935487,"Background Our aim was to assess how atrial fibrillation (AF) induction, chronicity, and RR interval irregularity affect left atrial (LA) function and size in the setting of underlying heart failure (HF), and to determine whether AF effects can be mitigated by vagal nerve stimulation (VNS). Methods HF was induced by 4-weeks of rapid ventricular pacing in 24 dogs. Subsequently, AF was induced and maintained by atrial pacing at 600 bpm. Dogs were randomized into control (n = 9) and VNS (n = 15) groups. In the VNS group, atrioventricular node fat pad stimulation (310 μs, 20 Hz, 3–7 mA) was delivered continuously for 6 months. LA volume and LA strain data were calculated from bi-weekly echocardiograms. Results RR intervals decreased with HF in both groups (p = 0.001), and decreased further during AF in control group (p = 0.014), with a non-significant increase in the VNS group during AF. LA size increased with HF (p<0.0001), with no additional increase during AF. LA strain decreased with HF (p = 0.025) and further decreased after induction of AF (p = 0.0001). LA strain decreased less (p = 0.001) in the VNS than in the control group. Beat-by-beat analysis showed a curvilinear increase of LA strain with longer preceding RR interval, (r = 0.45, p <0.0001) with LA strain 1.1% higher (p = 0.02) in the VNS-treated animals, independent of preceding RR interval duration. The curvilinear relationship between ratio of preceding and pre-preceding RR intervals, and subsequent LA strain was weaker, (r = 0.28, p = 0.001). However, VNS-treated animals again had higher LA strain (by 2.2%, p = 0.002) independently of the ratio of preceding and pre-preceding RR intervals. Conclusions In the underlying presence of pacing-induced HF, AF decreased LA strain, with little impact on LA size. LA strain depends on the preceding RR interval duration."

Although TSHβ has been known for many years to be made by cells of the immune system, the role of immune system TSH has remained unclear. Recent studies demonstrated that cells of the immune system produce a novel splice variant isoform of TSHβ (TSHβv), but little if any native TSHβ. Here, we show that within three days of systemic infection of mice with Listeria monocytogenes, splenic leukocytes synthesized elevated levels of TSHβv. This was accompanied by an influx of CD14+, Ly6C+, Ly6G+ cells into the thyroid of infected mice, and increased levels of intrathyroidal TSHβv gene expression. Adoptive transfer of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled splenic leukocytes from infected mice into non-infected mice migrated into the thyroid as early as forty-eight hours post-cell transfer, whereas CFSE-labeled cells from non-infected mice failed to traffic to the thyroid.

Methods Analyses included the 496 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients among 5122 patients in the Tysabri Observational Program (TOP) who had completed 4 continuous years of natalizumab treatment and had baseline (study enrollment) and postbaseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) assessments. Proportions of patients with 6-month or 12-month confirmed ≥1.0-point EDSS progression relative to baseline were compared in treatment months 1–24 and 25–48. Sensitivity analyses compared progression rates in months 13–24 and 25–36. Results Baseline characteristics appeared similar between the overall TOP population (N = 5122), patients who had completed 4 years of natalizumab treatment (n = 469), and patients eligible to complete 4 years in TOP who had discontinued natalizumab after 2 years of treatment (n = 514). Among 4-year completers, the proportion of patients with 6-month and 12-month confirmed EDSS progression decreased between months 1–24 and 25–48 of natalizumab treatment by 42% (from 10.9% to 6.3%; p < 0.01) and 52% (from 9.5% to 4.6%; p < 0.01), respectively. Few patients had 6-month or 12-month confirmed EDSS progression in both epochs (0.6% and 0.2%, respectively). Between months 13–24 and 25–36 of treatment, the proportion of patients with 6-month and 12-month confirmed EDSS progression decreased by 60% (from 7.5% to 3.0%; p < 0.01) and 58% (from 6.7% to 2.8%; p < 0.01), respectively. Significant reductions in disability progression events between months 13–24 and 25–36 were also observed in relapse-free patients. Conclusion In this observational study, the disability progression rate decreased further beyond 2 years of natalizumab treatment.

MSSS-88 consists of 88 items grouped in eight sections. Internal consistency of the MSSS-88SR subscales was determined using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Test/retest reliability with an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for each MSSS-88SR subscale was performed. Clinical validity of MSSS-88SR was determined by correlations with the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS).The range of Cronbach's alpha for all scales and ICC was 0.91-0.96 and 0.84-0.91, respectively. All ICCs were statistically significant (p<0.05). All evaluated subscales of MSSS-88 were significantly correlated with the NRS scale. The highest correlation coefficients were registered between the WL subscale and the EDSS and MAS, while the strongest relationship was observed between the MSS subscale and the NRS.The Serbian translated version of this instrument may be useful as a clinical measure for spasticity and functionality in patients with MS."

Forty acute ischemic stroke patients (20 patients with right hemispheric infarction with neglect, 10 patients with right hemispheric infarction without neglect, and 10 patients with left hemispheric infarction) and 10 healthy controls were prospectively enrolled to validate the CTST. The test requires subjects to set a table by dragging 12 dishes located below the table on the tablet screen. The horizontal deviation of the 12 dishes from the midline of the table, the selection tendency measured by the sequence of the dish selection, and the elapsed time for table setting were calculated automatically.Parameters measured by the CTST were correlated with the results of conventional neglect tests. The horizontal deviation was significantly higher in patients with right hemispheric infarction with neglect compared with the other groups. The selection tendency and elapsed time also were significantly different in patients with right hemispheric infarction with neglect compared with the left hemispheric infarction and control groups, but were similar to those with right hemispheric infarction without neglect.The CTST is feasible to administer and comparable with conventional neglect tests.

https://openalex.org/W2237610721,"The littoral zone ecosystem of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) has become significantly degraded by annual cycles of prolonged winter flooding and summer drought. For purposes of flood control and sediment management, the water level in the reservoir is lowered by 30 m during the summer monsoon season and raised again to 175 m above sea level each year at the end of the monsoon period. To explore an effective way to promote biodiversity and associated ecosystem services, we examined Taxodium distichum as a species for afforesting the littoral zone. Sapling growth variations were measured after two rounds of winter flooding. Dominant influence factors were determined by redundancy analysis. Herb community similarities between the experimental afforested areas and nearby control areas were assessed to detect the ecosystem influence of the experimental afforestation. 94.5% of saplings planted at elevations above 168 m survived. All measured growth indices (tree height, diameter at breast height, crown width and foliage density) decreased as the flood depth increased. Completely submerged saplings had a mean dieback height of -0.65 m. Greater initial foliage density led to increased tree height and stem diameter. Shannon-Wiener indices were not significantly different between plots in experimental and control areas, but the low similarity of herb communities between experimental and control areas (0.242 on average) suggested that afforestation would enrich plant community structure and improve littoral zone ecosystem stability. Because littoral zone afforestation provides several ecosystem services (habitat, carbon sink, water purification and landscaping), it is a promising revegetation model for the TGR."

https://openalex.org/W2409087339,"Background Ultiva® is commonly administered intravenously for analgesia during general anaesthesia and its main constituent remifentanil is an ultra-short-acting μ-opioid receptor agonist. Ultiva® is not approved for epidural or intrathecal use in clinical practice. Previous studies have reported that Ultiva® provokes opioid-induced hyperalgesia by interacting with spinal dorsal horn neurons. Ultiva® contains glycine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter but also an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor co-activator. The presence of glycine in the formulation of Ultiva® potentially complicates its effects. We examined how Ultiva® directly affects nociceptive transmission in the spinal cord. Methods We made patch-clamp recordings from substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons in the adult rat spinal dorsal horn in vivo and in spinal cord slices. We perfused Ultiva® onto the SG neurons and analysed its effects on the membrane potentials and synaptic responses activated by noxious mechanical stimuli. Results Bath application of Ultiva® hyperpolarized membrane potentials under current-clamp conditions and produced an outward current under voltage-clamp conditions. A barrage of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by the stimuli was suppressed by Ultiva®. Miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were depressed in frequency but not amplitude. Ultiva®-induced outward currents and suppression of mEPSCs were not inhibited by the μ-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, but were inhibited by the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine. The Ultiva®-induced currents demonstrated a specific equilibrium potential similar to glycine. Conclusions We found that intrathecal administration of Ultiva® to SG neurons hyperpolarized membrane potentials and depressed presynaptic glutamate release predominantly through the activation of glycine receptors. No Ultiva®-induced excitatory effects were observed in SG neurons. Our results suggest different analgesic mechanisms of Ultiva® between intrathecal and intravenous administrations."
https://openalex.org/W2237694438,"The human complement system is composed of more than 30 proteins and many of these have conserved domains that allow tracing the phylogenetic evolution. The complement system seems to be initiated with the appearance of C3 and factor B (FB), the only components found in some protostomes and cnidarians, suggesting that the alternative pathway is the most ancient. Here, we present the characterization of an arachnid homologue of the human complement component FB from the spider Loxosceles laeta. This homologue, named Lox-FB, was identified from a total RNA L. laeta spider venom gland library and was amplified using RACE-PCR techniques and specific primers. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence and the domain structure showed significant similarity to the vertebrate and invertebrate FB/C2 family proteins. Lox-FB has a classical domain organization composed of a control complement protein domain (CCP), a von Willebrand Factor domain (vWFA), and a serine protease domain (SP). The amino acids involved in Mg2+ metal ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) found in the vWFA domain in the vertebrate C2/FB proteins are well conserved; however, the classic catalytic triad present in the serine protease domain is not conserved in Lox-FB. Similarity and phylogenetic analyses indicated that Lox-FB shares a major identity (43%) and has a close evolutionary relationship with the third isoform of FB-like protein (FB-3) from the jumping spider Hasarius adansoni belonging to the Family Salcitidae."

By incorporating a deep learning model, we derive a solution using convex relaxation and quadratic-programming transformation. Moreover, we propose a data-driven evaluation method in place of the expensive field experiments. Using a Twitter dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our dynamics engineering approach for both pattern matching and profit maximization, and study the multifaceted interplay among several important factors of dynamics engineering, such as solution validity, pattern-matching accuracy, and intervention cost. Finally, the method we propose is general enough to work with multi-dimensional time series, so it can potentially be used in many other applications."
https://openalex.org/W2238387563,"Effective response planning and preparedness are critical to the health and well-being of communities in the face of biological emergencies. Response plans involving mass prophylaxis may seem feasible when considering the choice of dispensing points within a region, overall population density, and estimated traffic demands. However, the plan may fail to serve particular vulnerable subpopulations, resulting in access disparities during emergency response. For a response plan to be effective, sufficient mitigation resources must be made accessible to target populations within short, federally-mandated time frames. A major challenge in response plan design is to establish a balance between the allocation of available resources and the provision of equal access to PODs for all individuals in a given geographic region. Limitations on the availability, granularity, and currency of data to identify vulnerable populations further complicate the planning process. To address these challenges and limitations, data driven methods to quantify vulnerabilities in the context of response plans have been developed and are explored in this article."
