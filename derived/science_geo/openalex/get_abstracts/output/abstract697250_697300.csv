https://openalex.org/W4286498522,"Introduction Avoidable blindness is a significant public health problem in India. Nationally representative RAAB surveys (Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness) are being conducted periodically in the country to know the current status of blindness in the country. The current study describes the findings from the RAAB survey conducted during 2015–19 in India. Methodology A cross-sectional, population-based survey was conducted across the entire country among persons aged 50 years and above using RAAB version 6 methodology. Presenting and pinhole visual acuity was recorded followed by lens examination using a torchlight. In order to estimate the prevalence of blindness and visual impairment in overall population in India, district weights were assigned to each of the 31 surveyed districts and the prevalence was standardized using the RAAB software. Results The overall weighted, age-gender standardized, prevalence of blindness (presenting visual acuity &lt;3/60 in better eye) in population aged ≥50 years was 1.99% (95% CI 1.94%, 2.13%) and of visual impairment (VI) (presenting visual acuity &lt;6/12 in better eye) was 26.68% (95% CI 26.57–27.17%). On multivariate analysis, adjusted odds ratio showed that blindness was associated with age ≥ 80 years (OR = 20.3, 95% CI: 15.6–26.4) and being illiterate (OR = 5.6, 95% CI: 3.6–8.9). Blindness was not found to be significantly associated with either gender or locality. Conclusion The results of the survey demonstrate that currently more than one fourth of persons aged 50 years and above are visually impaired (PVA&lt;6/12 in better eye) in India. The prevalence of blindness among them is 1.99%, and older age and illiteracy are significantly associated with blindness. Major causes of blindness included cataract (66.2%), corneal opacity (CO) (8.2%), cataract surgical complications (7.2%), posterior segment disorders (5.9%) and glaucoma (5.5%). The proportion of blindness and visual impairment that is due to avoidable causes include 92.9% and 97.4% respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4286493308,"Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has affected our day-to-day in a great extent. Healthcare industry is one of the mainstream fields among those and produced a noticeable change in treatment and education. Medical students must comprehend well why AI technologies mediate and frame their decisions on medical issues. Formalizing of instruction on AI concepts can facilitate learners to grasp AI outcomes in association with their sensory perceptions and thinking in the dynamic and ambiguous reality of daily medical practice. The purpose of this study is to provide consensus on the competencies required by medical graduates to be ready for artificial intelligence technologies and possible applications in medicine and reporting the results. Materials and methods A three-round e-Delphi survey was conducted between February 2020 and November 2020. The Delphi panel accorporated experts from different backgrounds; (i) healthcare professionals/ academicians; (ii) computer and data science professionals/ academics; (iii) law and ethics professionals/ academics; and (iv) medical students. Round 1 in the Delphi survey began with exploratory open-ended questions. Responses received in the first round evaluated and refined to a 27-item questionnaire which then sent to the experts to be rated using a 7-point Likert type scale (1: Strongly Disagree—7: Strongly Agree). Similar to the second round, the participants repeated their assessments in the third round by using the second-round analysis. The agreement level and strength of the consensus was decided based on third phase results. Median scores was used to calculate the agreement level and the interquartile range (IQR) was used for determining the strength of the consensus. Results Among 128 invitees, a total of 94 agreed to become members of the expert panel. Of them 75 (79.8%) completed the Round 1 questionnaire, 69/75 (92.0%) completed the Round 2 and 60/69 (87.0%) responded to the Round 3. There was a strong agreement on the 23 items and weak agreement on the 4 items. Conclusions This study has provided a consensus list of the competencies required by the medical graduates to be ready for AI implications that would bring new perspectives to medical education curricula. The unique feature of the current research is providing a guiding role in integrating AI into curriculum processes, syllabus content and training of medical students."
https://openalex.org/W4286491304,"Anopheles stephensi, an invasive malaria vector, has been reported to have three biological forms identifiable mainly based on the number of ridges present on the egg's floats. Recently, the first intron of the odorant-binding protein-1 (AsteObp1) has been introduced as a molecular marker for the identification of these forms, and based on this marker, the presence of three putative sibling species (designated as species A, B and C) has been proposed. However, there is no data on the association of proposed markers with biological form or putative species on field populations.Field collected and laboratory-reared An. stephensi were characterized for biological forms based on the number of ridges on the egg's float. DNA sequencing of the partial AsteObp1 gene of An. stephensi individuals were performed by Sanger's method, either directly or after cloning with a plasmid vector. Additionally, AsteObp1 sequences of various laboratory lines of An. stephensi were retrieved from a public sequence database.AsteObp1 intron-1 in Indian An. stephensi populations are highly polymorphic with the presence of more than 13 haplotypes exhibiting nucleotides as well as length-polymorphism (90-to-121 bp). No specific haplotype or a group of closely related haplotypes of intron-1 was found associated with any biological form identified morphologically. High heterozygosity for this marker with a low inbreeding coefficient in field and laboratory populations indicates that this marker is not suitable for the delimitation of putative sibling species, at least in Indian populations.AsteObp1 cannot serve as a marker for identifying biological forms of An. stephensi or putative sibling species in Indian populations."
https://openalex.org/W4286493389,"Liberalized state-level recreational cannabis policies in the United States (US) fostered important policy evaluations with a focus on epidemiological parameters such as proportions [e.g., active cannabis use prevalence; cannabis use disorder (CUD) prevalence]. This cannabis policy evaluation project adds novel evidence on a neglected parameter–namely, estimated occurrence of newly incident cannabis use for underage (&lt;21 years) versus older adults. The project’s study populations were specified to yield nationally representative estimates for all 51 major US jurisdictions, with probability sample totals of 819,543 non-institutionalized US civilian residents between 2008 and 2019. Standardized items to measure cannabis onsets are from audio computer-assisted self-interviews. Policy effect estimates are from event study difference-in-difference (DiD) models that allow for causal inference when policy implementation is staggered. The evidence indicates no policy-associated changes in the occurrence of newly incident cannabis onsets for underage persons, but an increased occurrence of newly onset cannabis use among older adults (i.e., &gt;21 years). We offer a tentative conclusion of public health importance: Legalized cannabis retail sales might be followed by the increased occurrence of cannabis onsets for older adults, but not for underage persons who cannot buy cannabis products in a retail outlet. Cannabis policy research does not yet qualify as a mature science. We argue that modeling newly incident cannabis use might be more informative than the modeling of prevalences when evaluating policy effects and provide evidence of the advantages of the event study model over regression methods that seek to adjust for confounding factors."
https://openalex.org/W4286489461,"p16 (CDKN2A) is a member of the INK4 class of cell cycle inhibitors, which is often dysregulated in cancer. However, the prevalence of p16 expression in different cancer types is controversial. 15,783 samples from 124 different tumor types and 76 different normal tissue types were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray format. p16 was detectable in 5,292 (45.0%) of 11,759 interpretable tumors. Except from adenohypophysis in islets of Langerhans, p16 staining was largely absent in normal tissues. In cancer, highest positivity rates were observed in uterine cervix squamous cell carcinomas (94.4%), non-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma, pTaG2 (100%), Merkel cell carcinoma (97.7%), and small cell carcinomas of various sites of origin (54.5%-100%). All 124 tumor categories showed at least occasional p16 immunostaining. Comparison with clinico-pathological data in 128 vulvar, 149 endometrial, 295 serous ovarian, 396 pancreatic, 1365 colorectal, 284 gastric, and 1245 urinary bladder cancers, 910 breast carcinomas, 620 clear cell renal cell carcinomas, and 414 testicular germ cell tumors revealed only few statistically significant associations. Comparison of human papilloma virus (HPV) status and p16 in 497 squamous cell carcinomas of different organs revealed HPV in 80.4% of p16 positive and in 20.6% of p16 negative cancers (p<0.0001). It is concluded, that a positive and especially strong p16 immunostaining is a feature for malignancy which may be diagnostically useful in lipomatous, urothelial and possibly other tumors. The imperfect association between p16 immunostaining and HPV infection with high variability between different sites of origin challenges the use of p16 immunohistochemistry as a surrogate for HPV positivity, except in tumors of cervix uteri and the penis."
https://openalex.org/W4286492023,"Objective To investigate the role of children in the home and household crowding as risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. Methods We used interview data from 6,831 U.S. adults screened for the Communities, Households and SARS/CoV-2 Epidemiology (CHASING) COVID Cohort Study in April 2020. Results In logistic regression models, the adjusted odds ratio [aOR] of hospitalization due to COVID-19 for having (versus not having) children in the home was 10.5 (95% CI:5.7–19.1) among study participants living in multi-unit dwellings and 2.2 (95% CI:1.2–6.5) among those living in single unit dwellings. Among participants living in multi-unit dwellings, the aOR for COVID-19 hospitalization among participants with more than 4 persons in their household (versus 1 person) was 2.5 (95% CI:1.0–6.1), and 0.8 (95% CI:0.15–4.1) among those living in single unit dwellings. Conclusion Early in the US SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, certain household exposures likely increased the risk of both SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and the risk of severe COVID-19 disease."
https://openalex.org/W4286491861,"Purpose We have previously reported that VEGF-B is more potent than VEGF-A in mediating corneal nerve growth in vitro and in vivo , and this stimulation of nerve growth appears to be different from stimulation of angiogenesis by these same ligands, at least in part due to differences in VEGF receptor activation. VEGF signaling may be modulated by a number of factors including receptor number or the formation of receptor hetero- vs. homodimers. In endothelial cells, VEGF receptor heterodimer (VEGR1/R2) activation after ligand binding and subsequent phosphorylation alters the activation of downstream signaling cascades. However, our understanding of these processes in neuronal cell types remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify the presence and distribution of VEGF Receptor-Ligand interactions in neuronal cells as compared to endothelial cells. Methods PC12 (rat neuronal cell line), MAEC (mouse aortic endothelial cell line), MVEC (mouse venous endothelial cell line) and HUVEC (human umbilical venous endothelial cell line; control group) were used. Cells were acutely stimulated either with VEGF-A (50 ng/μL) or VEGF-B (50 ng/μL) or “vehicle” (PBS; control group). We also isolated mouse trigeminal ganglion cells from thy1 -YFP neurofluorescent mice. After treatment, cells were used as follows: (i) One group was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 immunostaining and visualized using confocal fluorescence microscopy and Total Internal Reflection (TIRF) microscopy; (ii) the second group was harvested in cell lysis buffer (containing anti-protease / anti-phosphatase cocktail), lysed and processed for immunoprecipitation (IP; Thermo Fisher IP kit) and immunoblotting (IB; LI-COR® Systems). Immunoprecipitated proteins were probed either with anti-VEGFR1 or anti-VEGFR2 IgG antibodies to evaluate VEGFR1-R2-heterodimerization; (iii) a third group of cells was also processed for Duolink Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA; Sigma) to assess the presence and distribution of VEGF-receptor homo- and heterodimers in neuronal and endothelial cells. Results TIRF and fluorescence confocal microscopy revealed the presence of VEGFR1 co-localized with VEGFR2 in endothelial and PC12 neuronal cells. Cell lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-VEGFR1 further validated the existence of VEGFR1-R2 heterodimers in PC12 neuronal cells. Neuronal cells showed higher levels of VEGFR1-R2 heterodimers as compared to endothelial cells whereas endothelial cells showed higher VEGFR2-R2 homodimers compared to neuronal cells as demonstrated by Duolink PLA. Levels of VEGFR1-R1 homodimers were very low in neuronal and endothelial cells. Conclusions Differences in VEGF Receptor homo- and heterodimer distribution may explain the differential role of VEGF ligands in neuronal versus endothelial cell types. This may in turn influence VEGF activity and regulation of neuronal cell homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W4286492187,"The winter maize area is rapidly spreading in south India in response to rising demand from the poultry and fish feed industries due to the absence of major environmental constraints. Further farmers' are using the winter environment to expand maize area and production. Hence there is immense potential to increase the area under winter maize cultivation. There were no planned field experiments to explore and optimize the right time of sowing and quantity of fertilizer to be added previously due to the presence of negligible winter maize area. Farmers used to cultivate maize as per their choice of sowing time with the application of a quantity of fertilizer recommended for rainy season maize. There were no efforts made towards working on economic analysis including energy budgeting. And hence the investigation was conducted with the objective to explore the optimal planting period and fertilizer levels for winter maize through economic and energy budgeting. Planting windows (1st week of October, 2nd week of October, 3rd week of October, 4th week of October, and 5th week of October) and fertility levels (100 percent recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF), 150 percent RDF, and 200 percent RDF) were used as factors in Factorial Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications. The present investigation revealed that significantly higher winter maize productivity was achieved from the first and second week of October planting along with the application of 200% RDF (recommended dose of fertilizer) followed by 150% RDF. Planting of winter maize during the first week of October recorded significantly higher grain yield (8786kg ha-1) and stover yield (1220 kg ha-1) and was found on par with sowing during the second week of October. Among fertility levels, significantly higher grain yield (8320 kg ha -1) and stover yield (1195 kg ha-1) was recorded with the application of 200% RDF and were found on par with the application of 150% RDF. Further interaction effect showed that higher dry matter production, more days for physiological maturity, higher accumulation of growing degree days, photothermal units, and heliothermal units were recorded from crops planted during the first and second week of October along with the application of either 200% or 150% RDF. However, higher nutrient use efficiency was recorded from the first and second week of October planted crop supplied with lower fertility level (100% RDF). Similarly, significantly higher net returns and gross returns, output energy, net energy, and specific energy were higher from crops planted during the first week of planting along with the application of 200% RDF. Whereas, energy use efficiency and energy productivity were higher with the first week of October planted crop applied with 100% RDF. From the overall interaction, it is recommended to plant winter maize during the first fortnight of October with the application of 150 percent RDF for sustaining higher maize productivity, energy output, and economics in the maize growing area of south India."
https://openalex.org/W4286498617,"A diabetes risk score cannot directly be translated and applied in different populations, and its performance should be evaluated in the target population. This study aimed to translate the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) instrument and compare its performance with the modified version for detecting undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and dysglycaemia among the Indonesian adult population. Forward and backward translations were performed and followed by cultural adaptation. In total, 1,403 participants were recruited. The FINDRISC-Bahasa Indonesia (FINDRISC-BI) was scored according to the original FINDRISC instrument, while a Modified FINDRISC-BI was analyzed using a specific body mass index and waist circumference classification for Indonesians. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and the optimal cut-offs of both instruments were estimated. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detecting undiagnosed T2DM was 0.73 (0.67-0.78) for the FINDRISC-BI with an optimal cut-off score of ≥9 (sensitivity = 63.0%; specificity = 67.3%) and 0.72 (0.67-0.78) for the Modified FINDRISC-BI with an optimal cut-off score of ≥11 (sensitivity = 59.8%; specificity = 74.9%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detecting dysglycaemia was 0.72 (0.69-0.75) for the FINDRISC-BI instrument with an optimal cut-off score of ≥8 (sensitivity = 66.4%; specificity = 67.0%), and 0.72 (0.69-0.75) for the Modified FINDRISC-BI instrument with an optimal cut-off score ≥9 (sensitivity = 63.8%; specificity = 67.6%). The Indonesian version of the FINDRISC instrument has acceptable diagnostic accuracy for screening people with undiagnosed T2DM or dysglycaemia in Indonesia. Modifying the body mass index and waist circumference classifications in the Modified FINDRISC-BI results in a similar diagnostic accuracy; however, the Modified FINDRISC-BI has a higher optimal cut-off point than the FINDRISC-BI. People with an above optimal cut-off score are suggested to take a further blood glucose test."
https://openalex.org/W4286490355,"Dementia is a major public health priority. Although there is abundant evidence of an association between dementia and poor cardiovascular health, findings have been inconsistent and uncertain in identifying which factors increase dementia risk in those with cardiovascular disease. Indeed, multiple variables including sociodemographic, economic, health, lifestyle and education may indicate who is at higher vs. lower dementia risk and could be used in prediction modelling. Therefore, the aim of this review is to synthesise evidence on the key risk factors for dementia in those with a history of cardiovascular disease.This is an overview of reviews protocol, registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021265363). Four electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews will be searched. Studies will be included if they are systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses that have investigated the risk of incident dementia (all-cause and subtypes including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia) in people with a history of coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and vascular stiffness. Study selection will be completed by two independent researchers according to the eligibility criteria, and conflicts resolved by a third reviewer. References will be exported into Covidence for title and abstract sifting, full-text review, and data extraction. Methodological quality will be assessed using the AMSTAR-2 criteria and confidence of evidence will be assessed using the GRADE classification. This overview of reviews will follow PRISMA guidelines. If there is sufficient homogeneity in the data, the results will be pooled, and a meta-analysis conducted to determine the strength of association between each risk factor and incident all-cause dementia and its subtypes for each cardiovascular diagnoses separately.We will create a comprehensive summary of the key risk factors linking cardiovascular diseases to risk of incident dementia. This knowledge is essential for informing risk predictive model development as well as the development of risk reduction and prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4286490589,"Ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is a save way to verify performance of donor lungs prior to implantation. A major problem of lung transplantation is a donor-to-recipient-transmission of bacterial cultures. Thus, a broadspectrum anti-infective treatment with sphingosine in EVLP might be a novel way to prevent such infections. Sphingosine inhalation might provide a reliable anti-infective treatment option in EVLP. Here, antimicrobial potency of inhalative sphingosine in an infection EVLP model was tested.A 3-hour EVLP run using pig lungs was performed. Bacterial infection was initiated 1-hour before sphingosine inhalation. Biopsies were obtained 60 and 120 min after infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Aliquots of broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) before and after inhalation of sphingosine were plated and counted, tissue samples were fixed in paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin and sectioned. Immunostainings were performed.Sphingosine inhalation in the setting of EVLP rapidly resulted in a 6-fold decrease of P. aeruginosa CFU in the lung (p = 0.016). We did not observe any negative side effects of sphingosine.Inhalation of sphingosine induced a significant decrease of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the epithelial layer of tracheal and bronchial cells. The inhalation has no local side effects in ex-vivo perfused and ventilated pig lungs."
https://openalex.org/W4286491786,"A novel contact model is presented to efficiently solve a face-mask contact problem by using the finite element (FE) method for the optimized design of a custom facial mask. Simulation of contact pressure for various mask designs considering material properties of the face allows virtual evaluation of the suitability of a mask design for a person's face without conducting empirical measurement of the face-mask contact pressure. The proposed contact model is accomplished by combining three approaches to reduce the calculation cost of simulating the face-mask contact: (1) use of a simplified and modifiable mask model that applies a spline curve to design points; (2) reduction of the FE model of the face by applying static condensation; and (3) application of a contact assumption that uses the Lagrange multiplier method. A numerical case study of a medical mask design showed that the proposed model could calculate the face-mask contact pressure efficiently (0.0448 sec per design). In a pilot usability experiment, the measured contact pressure was found similar values (range of mean contact pressure: 0.0093 ~ 0.0150 MPa) to the estimated values (range of mean contact pressure: 0.0097 ~ 0.0116 MPa)."
https://openalex.org/W4286493980,"Post-COVID symptoms are the new concern in the COVID-19 pandemic, where recovered patients experience residual symptoms affecting their quality of life. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate the role of complete vaccination, prescribed medication, and micronutrients during COVID episodes in the occurrence of post-COVID symptoms.A longitudinal evaluation of Indonesia's recovered COVID-19 patients was performed using the data collected from July 2021 and extracted in mid-February 2022. All participants were confirmed with a Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction test (PCR) and/or antigen test. This study collected demography and comorbidities information, symptoms and treatment of COVID-19, and collection of self-reported post-COVID symptoms every 30 days within 90 days after diagnosis/onset. Exposures of interest include vaccination status, Favipiravir administration, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Zinc. A Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) was used to evaluate the longitudinal effect of exposures, presented with adjusted odds ratios and its 95% confidence interval.A total of 923 participants (18.2% fully-vaccinated) were involved in the study, with 79.7% being non-hospitalized. Only 25.7% did not develop any residual symptoms within 90 days. Fatigue was the most reported post-COVID symptom in each measurement time (39.5%, 16.3%, and 7.3%). Full-vaccination was effective against chronic cough (aOR 0.527, 95% CI 0.286-0.971), chronic headache (aOR 0.317, 95% CI 0.163-0.616), and chronic arthritis (aOR 0.285, 95% CI 0.116-0.703). The combination of micronutrient supplementations and Favipiravir gave no significant effect on all post-COVID symptoms. However, early initiation of Favipiravir and delaying vitamin D administration were associated with arthritis.Full vaccination of COVID-19 prevents the disease and the development of residual symptoms when infected with SARS-COV-2. Hence, it is crucial to reconsider the prescription of micronutrient supplementation or adjust the dose of Favipiravir in the current guideline."
https://openalex.org/W4286499967,"Computational drug repositioning aims to identify potential applications of existing drugs for the treatment of diseases for which they were not designed. This approach can considerably accelerate the traditional drug discovery process by decreasing the required time and costs of drug development. Tensor decomposition enables us to integrate multiple drug- and disease-related data to boost the performance of prediction. In this study, a nonnegative tensor decomposition for drug repositioning, NTD-DR, is proposed. In order to capture the hidden information in drug-target, drug-disease, and target-disease networks, NTD-DR uses these pairwise associations to construct a three-dimensional tensor representing drug-target-disease triplet associations and integrates them with similarity information of drugs, targets, and disease to make a prediction. We compare NTD-DR with recent state-of-the-art methods in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and the area under the precision and recall curve (AUPR) and find that our method outperforms competing methods. Moreover, case studies with five diseases also confirm the reliability of predictions made by NTD-DR. Our proposed method identifies more known associations among the top 50 predictions than other methods. In addition, novel associations identified by NTD-DR are validated by literature analyses."
https://openalex.org/W4286207957,"The last few decades have seen an increased interest in ‘Mental Health Literacy (MHL)’ which addresses knowledge and beliefs relating to mental health problems and is likely to hinder treatment-seeking behaviors. Although MHL research to date has explored various mental disorders, far too little attention has been paid to Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and Problematic Smartphone use (PSU). The objective of this study is to develop an MHL questionnaire for IGD and PSU by adopting the MHL approach in the previous literature and examine MHL of IGD and PSU in Korean teenagers by focusing on their ability to recognize addictions, and perceptions and help-seeking attitudes towards a person with addictions. The current study also aimed to compare Korean teenagers’ MHL depending on low- and high-risk of IGD and PSU. A total of 169 teenagers aged 10 and 16 years were recruited from schools and children’s centers in Seoul and completed the newly developed MHL questionnaire and screening questionnaires for IGD and PSU. The MHL questionnaire for IGD and PSU was designed as a vignette-based questionnaire that depicted behavioral characteristics of a severe problem with Internet and smartphone usage. Korean teenagers had a poor ability to recognize IGD and PSU and were more prone to seek parental help than professional help. The current study also showed that teenagers had better recognition of IGD than PSU and perceived that a person with IGD has a more difficult life than a person with PSU. Furthermore, a low-risk or high-risk group of IGD or PSU showed minimal differences in MHL. The current study provided empirical evidence to support a need to develop educational programs to improve Korean teenagers’ MHL for both IGD and PSU."
https://openalex.org/W4286490133,"Background In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the importance of creating a healthy ethical climate. Although relationship with various factors and the ethical climate have been reported, understanding of the relationship between ethical education and ethical climate is limited. Aim This study aims to investigate the relationship between ethical climate, personal characteristics, and continuing education for ethics. Methods This study conducted a quantitative cross-sectional survey of 605 nurses in 3 teaching hospitals in Japan. Multiple-regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between ethical climate and demographic characteristics and continuing education. Further mean of ethical climate scores were compared between received continuing education and did not, using analysis of covariance adjusted for demographic variables. Findings The ethical climate showed significant association with hospital, gender, specialty of the unit, experience of ethics education, in-service ethical training, and workshops/ academic conferences on nursing ethics. In multiple-regression analysis, attending in-service ethical training increased the mean of ethical climate score (p = 0.031) and workshops/ academic conferences decreased the mean score (p = 0.028). Adjusted-mean of ethical climate score of nurses who had in-service training was significantly higher than those who had not (p = 0.038), whereas adjusted-mean of it of nurses who had attended workshops/ academic conferences was significant lower (p = 0.033). Discussion In-service training on ethics was associated with the positive ethical climate. Hospital should enhance ethical education. Conclusion Ethical climate related to the nurses’ personal characteristics and continuing education. We propose that organizational support for ethical education may be effective in raising the ethical climate of the workplace."
https://openalex.org/W4286490342,We aimed to assess women's perceptions on the long-term risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD) after major pregnancy complications.Women who experienced major pregnancy complications and those who experienced uncomplicated pregnancies were invited to participate in a qualitative study. Focus group discussions (FGDs) and self-administered questionnaires were used to explore: The knowledge of long-term sequelae after experiencing a major pregnancy complication; Importance of education on heart health; The practicality of referral to a clinic after pregnancy complications; Willingness for regular postpartum clinic visits after pregnancy complications. A thematic qualitative analysis was undertaken.26 women participated in four FGDs. The majority of women did not know of the association between major pregnancy complications and CVD. The main views expressed were: Women who experience pregnancy complications should receive education on improving heart health; An appointment for the first CVD risk screening visit needs to be made prior to discharge from the delivery suite; Women will benefit by having the option to select between a hospital and a general-practitioner based model of follow up.These views are important in developing postpartum strategies to reduce CVD risk among women who experience pregnancy complications.
https://openalex.org/W4286491017,"This study looks at the association of adolescent's time use on the acquisition of cognitive and non-cognitive (psychological and social) skills, thus contributing to the literature on parental investment and skills development. Specifically, using data relating to adolescent's time spent on school, study, sleep, and play, we investigate how these relate to cognitive and non-cognitive skills of older Indian children. For cognitive skills we use Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), which is a well-accepted measure of verbal intelligence. For non-cognitive skills, we construct a self-esteem variable using pride and shame questions; and a resilience variable using questions pertaining to whether an adolescent can get external help for coping with problems. Our results suggest that time use in all four types of activity has a positive association in the development of cognitive skills but competing associations when it comes to non-cognitive skills. We conclude that parental inputs into skills development, such as guidance about adolescent's time-use, are likely to have a differential association depending on the kind of skills being developed."
https://openalex.org/W4286498141,"Multiple studies show orthopedic health problems for medical staff due to wearing radiation protection aprons. The aim of this study was to evaluate the weight pressure on the shoulder as a marker of physical strain caused by different radiation-protection devices.For the weight pressure measurement, a pressure sensor (OMD-30-SE-100N, OptoForce, Budapest, Hungary) placed on the left and right shoulder was used. Wearing different radiation protection systems the force measurement system was used to quantify the weight pressure. Measurements were acquired in still standing position and during various movements.A mean significant decreasing weight pressure on the shoulder between 74% and 84% (p<0.001) was measured, when the free-hanging radiation protection system was used in comparison to one-piece and two-piece radiation protection aprons and coats. Using two-piece radiation protection aprons, the weight pressure was significantly lower than that of one-piece radiation protection coats. If a belt was used for the one-piece radiation protection coat, the weight pressure on the shoulder was reduced by 32.5% (p = 0.003). For a two-piece radiation protection apron and a one-piece radiation protection coat (with and without belt) a significant different weight pressure distribution between the right and left shoulder could be measured.The free-hanging radiation protection system showed a significant lower weight pressure in comparison to the other radiation protection devices. Apart from this, use of a two-piece radiation protection apron or addition of a belt to a radiation protection coat proved to be further effective options to reduce weight pressure."

However, research on risky sexual behavior and its determinants among unmarried men (never married, widowed, and divorced) who are highly vulnerable to risky sexual behavior was limited. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the magnitude of risky sexual behavior and its determinants among non-married men using a nationally representative sample. Methods The analysis was done on 5680 sexually active unmarried men aged 15–59 years using data from the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic Health Survey (EDHS). The main outcome variable was risky sexual behavior which defined as having at least one of the following: multiple sexual partners; initiation of sex before the age of 18 years; inconsistent condom use in the last 12 months; alcohol consumption at last sex. Multivariable generalized linear mixed-effects regression was employed to identify variables associated with risky sexual behavior. Result The overall magnitude of risky sexual behavior was 26.9% (95% CI; 25.7, 28.0). Currently employed (AOR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.64–3.77), history of HIV testing (AOR = 2.51, 95% C = 1.95–3.23), drinking alcohol almost every day (AOR = 5.49, 95 CI = 2.73–11.02), and using Internet daily (AOR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.06–3.74) increase the odds of risky sexual behavior. Whereas, primary education (AOR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.32–0.61), secondary education level (AOR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.29–0.72) and a high proportion of community-level media exposure (AOR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.12–0.75) decrease the odds of risky sexual behavior. Conclusion In general, a significant proportion of sexually active unmarried men in Ethiopia have practiced risky sexual behavior. An intervention should be designed which are against the factors found to increase the odds of risky sexual behavior to reduce the incidence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections."
https://openalex.org/W4286499666,"Red seabream ( Pagrus major ), a migratory fish, is characterized by high protein levels in the muscle. South Korean and Japanese red seabreams have a general distribution pattern; however, distinguishing them based on their geographical origin is difficult. In this study, we used capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOF/MS) to analyze the red seabream muscle metabolome to investigate how can distinguish the origin of the fish. The metabolites were extracted using 50% acetonitrile in water. Chromatographic separation was successfully used to classify the metabolite profiles of Japanese and South Korean red seabream. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis showed good ability to categorize the samples according to their origin. Amino acids showed the greatest quantitative difference in South Korean and Japanese muscle samples. Specifically, the L-alanine, L-glutamic acid, L-isoleucine, dimethylglycine, and L-valine levels in Japanese red seabream samples were significantly higher than those in South Korean samples. In contrast, the levels of trimethylamine N-oxide and inosine monophosphate in South Korean muscle samples were significantly higher than those in Japanese red muscle samples. The monitored metabolite profiles suggest that South Korean and Japanese red seabreams can be identified on the basis of amino acid levels."

We also intended to assess the applicability of these values for the Japanese population by comparing them to those published by the Global Lung Function Initiative in 2017 (GLI-2017) and previous values.In this retrospective study, we measured the spirometric indices, DLCO, VA, and KCO of the Japanese population aged 16-85 years. The lambda, mu, and sigma (LMS) method and the generalized additive models for the location, scale, and shape program in R were used to generate the reference values.We conducted a total of 390 tests. The GLI-2017 z-scores of DLCO were approximately zero, whereas those of KCO and VA were far from zero. In the present study, the mean square errors of the DLCO, VA, and KCO reference values were lower than the reference values derived from GLI-2017 and previous linear regression equations.Reference values obtained in this study were more appropriate for our sample than those reported in GLI-2017. Differences between the two equations were attributed to underestimating KCO (DLCO / VA) and overestimating VA, respectively, by the GLI-2017 for the Japanese population."
https://openalex.org/W4286500334,"The research described herein is based on the assumptions of the sensory processing sensitivity concept and the meta framework for the concept of environmental sensitivity. The adopted theoretical framework shows that individuals differ in their sensitivity to the environment, with some being more sensitive than others. From the evolutionary perspective, it has also been assumed that sensory processing sensitivity follows a normal distribution in the population, with a minority being exceptionally or highly sensitive to environmental stimuli. We explored data from a sample of 928 young adolescents in two studies. The tool used to evaluate their sensitivity was the Highly Sensitive Child Scale, which in studies 1 and 2 had a three-factor structure. Latent class analysis was used for the interpretation of the data of the studied groups. The obtained results indicate the existence of three groups which differ significantly from each other according to the HSC result. Based on the obtained results, it may be assumed that young adolescents are divided into three groups characterized by different sensitivities and their percentage distribution is not in agreement with the research conducted to date. The acquired information has both a theoretical value and a practical applicability, prompting reflection about the different aspects of the study, such as cultural differences, changes related to the development stage and the characteristics of the evaluation tool itself. From the perspective of possible applications, the obtained results may provide important information (1) to decision-makers who plan support or intervention programs at various levels of prevention, (2) for practitioners to provide them with the means with which to consider sensitivity as an important factor in coping with difficulties through diversified and adequate support (3) that is broadly applicable in the face of an environmental crisis (pandemic, the changing structure of class groups which is related to the number of refugees)."

Demographic, clinicopathological, treatment and outcome information were obtained. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the effects of variables on PFS and OS.Eighteen patients (29%) presented as FIGO stage I disease, 5 patients (8%) as stage II, 16 patients (26%) as stage III and 22 patients (36%) as stage IV disease. Fifty of the 61 patients (82%) had surgery. Five-year PFS and 5-year OS were 17.3% (CI 8.9%-27.9%) and 19.7% (CI 10.6%-30.8%), respectively. Seventeen patients presented with recurrence of which 5 (29.4%) were local and 12 (70.6%) were outside the pelvis. In the univariate analysis, tumour diameter ≥ 100mm (HR 4.57; 95% CI 1.59-13.19; p-value 0.005) was associated with 5-year PFS and in univariate analysis of OS, a positive family history (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.18-0.99; p-value 0.047), receiving a full staging operation (HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.18-0.78; p-value 0.008) and receiving any other modality of treatment, with or without surgery, (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.27-0.85; p-value 0.012) were associated with better survival. An abnormal cervical smear (HR 2.4; 95% CI 1.03-5.6; p-value 0.041), late-stage disease (HR 3.48; 95% CI 1.79-6.77; p-value < 0.001), presence of residual tumour (HR 3.66; 95% CI 1.90-7.02; p-value < 0.001), myometrial invasion more than 50% (HR 2.29; 95% CI 1.15-4.57; p-value 0.019), cervical involvement (HR 3.38; 95% CI 1.64-6.97; p-value 0.001) and adnexal involvement (HR 3.21; 95% CI 1.56-6.63; p-value 0.002) were associated with a higher risk of death. In the multivariate analysis, full staging operation was associated with a risk of progression of disease (HR 3.49; 95% CI 1.17-10.41; p-value 0.025). Advanced stage (HR 4.2; 95% CI 2.09-8.44; p-value < 0.001) was associated with a higher risk of death. Any other modality of treatment (HR 0.28; 95% CI 0.15-0.53; p-value < 0.001) and full staging laparotomy (HR 0.27; 95% CI 0.12-0.59; p-value 0.001) was a protective factor for death.Carcinosarcoma is an aggressive cancer with poorer survival in this specific cohort than has been described in other contemporary cohorts. Biological or genetic factors are a possible explanation for lower overall survival in this population. Although it is also possible that later diagnosis and poor access to health care contribute to poorer survival. Most recurrences occur outside of the pelvis. Full staging surgery (including pelvic lymphadenectomy) and additional use of other modalities (either for radical or palliative intent) improve survival."
https://openalex.org/W4286489019,"Based on the special stock exchange comment letter system in China, this paper explores the relationship between the exchange tax-related comment letters and corporate tax avoidance behavior from the standpoint of securities regulation. We document that firms that engage in more aggressive tax avoidance are more likely to receive a tax-related exchange comment letter. Also, relative to firms receiving a non-tax-related comment letter, firms receiving a tax-related comment letter reduce their tax avoidance behaviors in subsequent years. Further study shows that the more the number of questions and the greater the level of detail in the comment letter, the stronger the effect of tax-related comment letters on corporate tax avoidance. After examining the sample with different degrees of political connection, we find that tax-related comment letters inhibit tax avoidance among state-owned enterprises and private enterprises with close political connections. Finally, the monitoring effect of comment letters on corporate tax avoidance is more pronounced in regions where tax administration is weak, suggesting that the comment letter system can be used as a complementary mechanism for tax administration."
https://openalex.org/W4286490368,"Mechanobiology plays an essential role in secondary bone fracture healing. While the introduction of newer type of plates, e.g. locking plate (LP), is becoming increasingly popular for complex femoral fractures, the conventional technique involving dynamic compression plate (DCP) remains the standard choice. The difference between the two techniques lies primarily in their screw fixation mechanisms. The present study applied 3D dynamic fracture healing scheme modelled on a subtrochanteric femur fracture, regulated by both finite element (FE) analysis and Fuzzy logic control in order to understand the spatio-temporal healing phenomena for both LP and DCP. The study further examined the influence of the two screw fixation mechanisms in determining the comparative progression of fracture healing. The problem was solved iteratively in several healing steps running in loop and accordingly, the local tissue concentrations and material properties were updated. The predicted results accorded well with various previous experimental observations. The study found an initial delay in healing associated with DCP. However, as the healing progressed, there was no significant difference in overall callus modulus. The presented preclinical model may further help predict bone healing for different implantation techniques, and thus can serve as a non-invasive tool for evaluating relative merits of extramedullary plating techniques."
https://openalex.org/W4286490553,"Objectives H. pylori (Hp) infection has been indicated in the pathogenesis of gastric diseases including gastric cancer (GC). This study aimed at exploring the relationships between Hp infection and gastric diseases including GC in a large dataset of routine patients undergoing gastroscopy. Methods From November 2007 to December 2017, 70,534 first-time visiting patients aged 18–94 years with gastroscopic biopsies were histologically diagnosed and analyzed. Patients’ data were entered twice in an Excel spreadsheet database and analyzed using the SPSS (version 22.0) software package and statistical significance was defined as P&lt;0.05 for all analyses. Results The first interesting observation was age-related twin-peak prevalence profiles (TPPs) for Hp infection, gastritis, and advanced diseases with different time spans (TS) between the first and second occurring peaks. Hp infection and gastritis had TPPs occurring at earlier ages than TPPs of gastric introepithelial neoplasia (GIN) and GC. More patients were clustered at the second occurring TPPs. The time spans (TS) from the first occurring peak of Hp infection to the first occurring peaks of other gastric diseases varied dramatically with 0–5 years for gastritis; 5–15 years for GINs, and 5–20 years for GC, respectively. The number of males with Hp infection and gastric diseases, excluding non-atrophic gastritis (NAG), was more than that of females (P&lt;0.001). Conclusions We have first observed age-related twin-peak prevalence profiles for Hp infection, gastritis, GIN, and GC, respectively, among a large population of patients undergoing gastroscopy. The second prevalence peak of GC is at ages of 70–74 years indicating that many GC patients would be missed during screening because the cut-off age for screening is 69 years old in China."

The following factors will be analyzed: inflammatory and metabolic markers, gut microbiome composition, lifestyle indicators (eating behavior, physical activity, chronotype, patient characteristics (childhood adversity among others), and polygenic risk scores.Psychiatric inpatients with at least moderate Major Depressive Disorder will be enrolled in a prospective, observational, naturalistic, monocentric study using stratified sampling. Ethical approval was obtained. Primary outcomes at 4 weeks will be percent weight change and symptom score change on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Both outcomes will also be binarized into clinically relevant outcomes at 5% weight gain and 50% symptom score reduction. Predictors for weight gain and treatment response will be tested using multiple hierachical regression for continuous outcomes, and multiple binary logistic regression for binarized outcomes. Psychotropic premedication, current medication, eating behavior, baseline BMI, age, and sex will be included as covariates. Further, a comprehensive analysis will be carried out using machine learning. Polygenic risk scores will be added in a second step to estimate the additional variance explained by genetic markers. Sample size calculation yielded a total amount of N = 171 subjects.Patient and physician expectancies regarding the primary outcomes and non-random sampling may affect internal validity and external validity, respectively. Through the prospective and naturalistic design, results will gain relevance to clinical practice. Examining the predictive value of patient profiles for weight gain and treatment response during pharmacotherapy will allow for targeted adjustments before and concomitantly to the start of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4286491609,"Producing statistically robust profiles of small or ‘hard-to-reach’ populations has always been a challenge for researchers. Since surveying the wider population in order to capture a large enough sample of cases is usually too costly or impractical, researchers have been opting for ‘snowballing’ or ‘time-location sampling’. The former does not allow for claims to representativeness, and the latter struggles with under-coverage and estimating confidence intervals. Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) is a method that combines snowballing sampling with an analytical algorithm that corrects for biases that arise in snowballing. For all its advantages, a major weakness of RDS has been around data collection. Traditionally done on-site, the process is costly and lengthy. When done online, it is cheaper and faster but under a serious threat from fraud, compromising data quality and validity of findings. This paper describes a real-life application of a RDS data collection system that maximizes fraud prevention while still benefiting from low cost and speedy data collection."
https://openalex.org/W4286492206,"Mangrove forests are the most important ecosystems on Pohnpei Island, Federated States of Micronesia, as the island communities of the central Pacific rely on the forests for many essential services including protection from sea-level rise that is occurring at a greater pace than the global average. As part of a multi-component assessment to evaluate vulnerabilities of mangrove forests on Pohnpei, mangrove forests were mapped at two points in time: 1983 and 2018. In 2018, the island had 6,426 ha of mangrove forest. Change analysis indicated a slight (0.76%) increase of mangrove area between 1983 and 2018, contrasting with global mangrove area declines. Forest structure and aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks were inventoried using a systematic sampling of field survey plots and extrapolated to the island using k-nearest neighbor and random forest species models. A gridded or wall to wall approach is suggested when possible for defining carbon stocks of a large area due to high variability seen in our data. The k-nearest neighbor model performed better than random forest models to map species dominance in these forests. Mean AGC was 167 ± 11 MgC ha-1, which is greater than the global average of mangroves (115 ± 7 MgC ha-1) but within their global range (37-255 MgC ha-1) Kauffman et al. (2020). In 2018, Pohnpei mangroves contained over 1.07 million MgC in AGC pools. By assigning the mean AGC stock per species per area to the map, carbon stock distributions were visualized spatially, allowing future conservation efforts to be directed to carbon dense stands."
https://openalex.org/W4286492838,"Introduction The high burden of stillbirths and neonatal deaths is driving global initiatives to improve birth outcomes. Discerning stillbirths from neonatal deaths can be difficult in some settings, yet this distinction is critical for understanding causes of perinatal deaths and improving resuscitation practices for live born babies. Methods We evaluated data from the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network to compare the accuracy of determining stillbirths versus neonatal deaths from different data sources and to evaluate evidence of resuscitation at delivery in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. CHAMPS works to identify causes of stillbirth and death in children &lt;5 years of age in Bangladesh and 6 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Using CHAMPS data, we compared the final classification of a case as a stillbirth or neonatal death as certified by the CHAMPS Determining Cause of Death (DeCoDe) panel to both the initial report of the case by the family member or healthcare worker at CHAMPS enrollment and the birth outcome as stillbirth or livebirth documented in the maternal health record. Results Of 1967 deaths ultimately classified as stillbirth, only 28 (1.4%) were initially reported as livebirths. Of 845 cases classified as very early neonatal death, 33 (4%) were initially reported as stillbirth. Of 367 cases with post-mortem examination showing delivery weight &gt;1000g and no maceration, the maternal clinical record documented that resuscitation was not performed in 161 cases (44%), performed in 14 (3%), and unknown or data missing for 192 (52%). Conclusion This analysis found that CHAMPS cases assigned as stillbirth or neonatal death after DeCoDe expert panel review were generally consistent with the initial report of the case as a stillbirth or neonatal death. Our findings suggest that more frequent use of resuscitation at delivery and improvements in documentation around events at birth could help improve perinatal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4286494096,"Postmenopausal women with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are more likely to have accelerated liver fibrosis, eventually advancing to liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The association between sex hormones and HBV-related HCC risk is unclear. We investigated whether hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is beneficial to postmenopausal women with HBV infection. This retrospective study selected the data of 44,465patients with HBV infection between January 2000 and December 2018 from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. After excluding patients with preexisting liver diseases, liver cirrhosis, or liver malignancies, we grouped the remaining 10,474 patients by whether they had undergone HRT for at least 3 months (n = 5,638) and whether they had not received HRT (n = 4,836). After propensity score matching, we assigned 3080 patients to an HRT cohort and matched them (1:1) with those in a non-HRT cohort. The incidence of HCC (P &lt; 0.022) and all-cause mortality rate (P &lt; 0.001) were lower in the HRT cohort than in the non-HRT cohort. The liver cirrhosis risk was not significantly higher in the HRT cohort (P = 0.355). HRT is associated with reduced HCC risk and improved survival outcomes but is unrelated to liver cirrhosis development in postmenopausal women."
https://openalex.org/W4286498146,"Sleep apnea (SA) is a prevalent disorder characterized by recurrent events of nocturnal apnea originating from obstructive and/or central mechanisms. SA disrupts normal sleep and can lead to a series of complications when left untreated. SA results in intermittent hypoxia which has an impact on the cardio- and cerebrovascular system. Hospitalized patients with SA typically have a greater burden of comorbidity, a longer length of hospital stay, but may show an improvement of in-hospital mortality compared to patients without diagnosed SA. The reason for this survival benefit is controversial and we aimed to clarify this protective effect in the light of predictive factors including SA-associated comorbidities using a nation-wide hospitalization database.Data were extracted from a nation-wide hospitalization database provided by the Swiss Federal Office for Statistics. Hospitalized patients with a SA co-diagnosis were extracted from the database together with a 1:1-matched control population without SA. Overall, 212'581 patients with SA were hospitalized in Switzerland between 2002 and 2018. Compared to the controls, SA cases had a longer median length of hospital stay (7 days; 95% CI: 3 to 15 vs. 4 days; 95% CI: 2 to 10) (p < 0.001) and a higher median number of comorbidities (8 comorbidities; IQR: 5 to 11 vs. 3 comorbidities; IQR: 1 to 6) (p < 0.001). The risk of in-hospital mortality was lower in the SA cases compared to the controls (OR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.7 to 0.76; p < 0.001). SA was associated with a survival benefit in hospitalizations related to 28 of 47 conditions with the highest rate of in-hospital death. Sixty-three comorbidities were significantly over-represented in SA cases among which obesity, hypertension and anatomic nasal deviations were associated with a significant decrease of in-hospital mortality.Compared to matched controls, SA was associated with significant and relevant inpatient survival benefit in a number of most deadly conditions. Within SA-patients, associated comorbidities mostly correlated with a poorer prognosis, whereas obesity and hypertension were associated with an improved in-hospital mortality."

Age, gender, clinical setting, days after onset of symptoms, and Ct values were recorded. Statistical analysis was carried out with special consideration of effect sizes.During the study period wtV was detected in 1013 samples (54%), while 845 (45%) patients carried the Alpha variant of concern (VOC), and 15 (1%) the Beta VOC. For further analysis, only wtV and the Alpha VOC were included. In a multi-factor ANOVA and post-hoc test with Bonferroni-correction for the age groups we found significant main-effects for Ct values of the viral variant (wtV mean 26.4 (SD 4.27); Alpha VOC mean 25.0 (SD 3.84); F (1,1850) = 55.841; p < .001) and the clinical setting (outpatients: mean 25.7 (SD 4.1); inpatients: mean 27.0 (SD 4.2); F (1,1850) = 8.520, p = .004). However, since the effect sizes were very small (eta squared for the Alpha VOC = .029 and the clinical setting = .004), there was only a slight trend towards higher viral loads of the Alpha VOC compared to wtV.In order to compare different variants of SARS-CoV-2 the calculation of effect sizes seems to be necessary. A combination of p-values as estimates of the existance of an effect and effect sizes as estimates of the magnitude of a potential effect may allow a better insight into transmission mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2."

A total of 8849 valid questionnaires were surveyed to compare the differences in the willingness of urban and rural residents to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Single factor analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to explore the influence of the epidemic situation on the willingness to be vaccinated.In the border areas between China and Vietnam in Yunnan Province, both urban and rural residents had a high willingness (> 90%) to receive the COVID-19 vaccination, with a higher level of willingness in urban than in rural areas and a higher willingness among residents aged ≥ 56 years. Rural residents mainly concerned about the vaccination were different from urban residents (p< 0.05). About 54.8% of urban respondents and 59.2% of rural respondents indicated that their willingness to get COVID-19 vaccine would be affected by new COVID-19 cases. Respondents who were divorced, had an occupation other than farming, had contraindications to vaccination, were concerned about the safety of vaccines and worried about virus mutation, thought that the epidemic situation would not affect their willingness to get vaccinated (p< 0.05).The prevention and control of epidemics in border areas is of considerable importance. It is necessary to conduct targeted health education and vaccine knowledge popularization among urban and rural residents to increase the vaccination rate and consolidate the epidemic prevention and control at the border."
https://openalex.org/W4286489517,"Objectives Supporting small and nutritionally at-risk (potentially malnourished) infants under six months is a global health priority, albeit with a weak evidence-base. To inform policy and research in this area, we aimed to assess the perceptions and understanding of infant malnutrition and its management among carers, communities, and healthcare workers in rural Ethiopia. Methods We conducted in-depth and key-informant interviews, from May-August 2020 in Jimma Zone and Deder District, Ethiopia. We used purposive sampling to recruit the participants. Interviews were transcribed into Amharic or Afaan Oromo and then translated into English. Atlas ti-7 was used to support data analysis. Findings were narrated based on the different themes arising from the interviews. Results Carers/community members and healthcare workers reported on five different themes: 1) Perceptions about health and well-being: an ‘ideal infant’ slept well, fed well, was active and looked ‘fat’; 2)Perceptions of feeding: overall knowledge of key recommendations like exclusive breastfeeding was good but practices were suboptimal, notably a cultural practice to give water to young infants; 3)Awareness about malnutrition: a key limitation was knowledge of exactly how to identify small and nutritionally at-risk infants; 4) Reasons for malnutrition: levels of understanding varied and included feeding problems and caregiver’s work pressures resulting in the premature introduction of complementary feeds; 5) Perceptions about identification &amp; treatment: carers prefer treatment close to home but were concerned about the quality of community-based services. Conclusion To succeed, research projects that investigate programes that manage small and nutritionally at-risk infants under six months should understand and be responsive to the culture and context in which they operate. They should build on community strengths and tackle misunderstandings and barriers. Interventions beyond just focusing on knowledge and attitude of the carers and health workers are necessary to tackle the challenges around infants under 6 months of age at risk of malnutrition. Moreover, stakeholders beyond the health sector should also be involved in order to support the infants under 6 months and their mothers as some of the key reasons behind the at-risk infants are just beyond the capacity of the health sector or health system. Our list of themes could be used to inform infant nutrition work not just in Ethiopia but also in many others."
https://openalex.org/W4286490104,"Sub-Sahara African countries face immense challenges in ensuring adequate sanitation and hygiene behaviours to the rapidly growing populations. Attempts to address these challenges require empirical evidence to inform policy and planning. We contribute toward that goal by unveiling findings of formative research conducted in Babati, a rapidly growing town in Tanzania. We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 486 households, to unwind motives and barriers for individuals to invest in improved sanitation services and hygiene behaviour change. We used several methods including household survey, focus group discussions, behaviour observations and spot checks. The findings revealed that households derive their motivation to invest in improved sanitation and hygiene practices from comfort, raising social status, and the need for personal safety and privacy. Other motives include fear of penalties and fines and fear of disease outbreaks, whilst the barriers include, limited water availability and accessibility, environmental factors, property rights, cultural issues, financial constraints, and a person’s attitude. Quantitative data were subjected to multivariate analysis to identify determinants of households to invest in sanitation and hygiene practices. The logistic regression analyses revealed that sources of water, property rights, and education level were the main determinants of households to invest in sanitation and hygiene facilities, while household income was the main determinant for households to invest in both construction of handwashing facility and water treatment. We argue that the initiative to promote sanitation and hygiene behaviour change in small towns should focus on promoting motivation factors and abating the determinant factors identified in this study."

The cytoplasmic domain (D)Ⅰ-Ⅱ linker in Cav1.2 plays a pivotal role in calcium channel inactivation, and mutations in this site have been associated with sLQT8 (such as Timothy syndrome) but not nsLQT8.Since we identified a novel CACNA1C mutation, located in the DⅠ-Ⅱ linker, associated with nsLQTS, we sought to reveal its biophysical defects.Target panel sequencing was employed in 24 genotype-negative nsLQTS probands (after Sanger sequencing) and three family members. Wild-type (WT) or R511Q Cav1.2 was transiently expressed in tsA201 cells, then whole-cell Ca2+ or Ba2+ currents (ICa or IBa) were recorded using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques.We identified two CACNA1C mutations, a previously reported R858H mutation and a novel R511Q mutation located in the DⅠ-Ⅱ linker. Four members of one nsLQTS family harbored the CACNA1C R511Q mutation. The current density and steady-state activation were comparable to those of WT-ICa. However, persistent currents in R511Q-ICa were significantly larger than those of WT-ICa (WT at +20 mV: 3.3±0.3%, R511Q: 10.8±0.8%, P<0.01). The steady-state inactivation of R511Q-ICa was weak in comparison to that of WT-ICa at higher prepulse potentials, resulting in increased window currents in R511Q-ICa. Slow component of inactivation of R511Q-ICa was significantly delayed compared to that of WT-ICa (WT-tau at +20 mV: 81.3±3.3 ms, R511Q-tau: 125.1±5.0 ms, P<0.01). Inactivation of R511Q-IBa was still slower than that of WT-IBa, indicating that voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI) of R511Q-ICa was predominantly delayed.Delayed VDI, increased persistent currents, and increased window currents of R511Q-ICa cause nsLQT8. Our data provide novel insights into the structure-function relationships of Cav1.2 and the pathophysiological roles of the DⅠ-Ⅱ linker in phenotypic manifestations."
https://openalex.org/W4286490554,"This study investigated whether liver damage severity relates to the mobilization of multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cells, which are endogenous reparative pluripotent stem cells, into the peripheral blood (PB) and whether the degree of mobilization relates to the recovery of liver volume following human liver surgery.Forty-seven patients who underwent liver surgery were included in the present study. PB-Muse cells were counted before surgery, on postoperative days (PODs) 3 and on POD 7. Liver volume was measured using computed tomography before and after surgery.The PB-Muse cell count increased after surgery. The number of PB-Muse cells before surgery was higher, but without statistical significance in the group with neoplasms than in the healthy group that included liver donors (p = 0.065). Forty-seven patients who underwent liver surgery were divided into major hepatic resection (MHR; hepatectomy of three or more segments according to the Couinaud classification, n = 22) and minor hepatic resection (mhr; hepatectomy of two segments or less according to the Couinaud classification, n = 25) groups. PB-Muse cells increased at high rates among MHR patients (p = 0.033). Except for complication cases, PB-Muse cells increased at higher rates in the group with advanced liver volume recovery (p = 0.043). The predictive impact of the rate of increase in PB-Muse cells on the recovery of liver volume was demonstrated by multivariate analysis (OR 11.0, p = 0.014).PB-Muse cell mobilization correlated with the volume of liver resection, suggesting that the PB-Muse cell number reflects the degree of liver injury. Given that the degree of PB-Muse cell mobilization was related to liver volume recovery, PB-Muse cells were suggested to contribute to liver regeneration, although this mechanism remains unclear."
https://openalex.org/W4286491753,"Approaching epidemiological data with flexible machine learning algorithms is of great value for understanding disease-specific association patterns. However, it can be difficult to correctly extract and understand those patterns due to the lack of model interpretability.We here propose a machine learning workflow that combines random forests with Bayesian network surrogate models to allow for a deeper level of interpretation of complex association patterns. We first evaluate the proposed workflow on synthetic data. We then apply it to data from the large population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP). Based on this combination, we discover and interpret broad patterns of individual serum TSH concentrations, an important marker of thyroid functionality.Evaluations using simulated data show that feature associations can be correctly recovered by combining random forests and Bayesian networks. The presented model achieves predictive accuracy that is similar to state-of-the-art models (root mean square error of 0.66, mean absolute error of 0.55, coefficient of determination of R2 = 0.15). We identify 62 relevant features from the final random forest model, ranging from general health variables over dietary and genetic factors to physiological, hematological and hemostasis parameters. The Bayesian network model is used to put these features into context and make the black-box random forest model more understandable.We demonstrate that the combination of random forest and Bayesian network analysis is helpful to reveal and interpret broad association patterns of individual TSH concentrations. The discovered patterns are in line with state-of-the-art literature. They may be useful for future thyroid research and improved dosing of therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4286491858,"Transgender and non-binary people face challenges in accessing gender affirming hormone therapy. Family planning clinics across the United States have greatly expanded transgender care services in the last ten years offering increased access to these services. This national qualitative study describes transgender and non-binary patients’ experiences of receiving transgender care in family planning clinics. We completed 34 in-depth interviews with transgender and non-binary people over age 18 who had received transition-related care at a family planning clinic in the last year from 2019–2020. We analyzed interview data in Dedoose using constant comparative analysis and inductive thematic analysis. Patients reported overwhelmingly positive experiences at family planning clinics and were especially surprised at the ease and speed of the informed consent process. Barriers to care remain for patients in rural areas, low income patients, and patients who need specialized care. Some of the barriers relate to the gender binary and transphobia built into the medical systems, which cause patients and providers to have to find “work arounds” the binary medical and insurance systems. Patients also shared their idealized visions of transition related care that center on strong referral networks and hiring of LGBTQ staff at the clinics. Family planning clinics currently provide affirming and supportive care, especially those that use the informed consent model. Family planning clinics could provide increased access to transgender healthcare outside of major metropolitan areas and for transgender and gender non-conforming clients across the lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W4286492408,"Hyperlactatemia occurs frequently after brain tumor surgery. Existing studies are scarce and predominantly retrospective, reporting inconsistent associations to new neurological deficits and prolonged hospital stay. Here we describe a protocol for a prospective observational study of hyperlactatemia during and after elective tumor craniotomy and the association with postoperative outcome, as well as selected pathophysiological aspects, and possible risk factors. We will include 450 brain tumor patients scheduled for elective craniotomy. Arterial blood samples for lactate and glucose measurement will be withdrawn hourly during surgery and until six hours postoperatively. To further explore the association of hyperlactatemia with perioperative insulin resistance, additional blood sampling measuring markers of insulin resistance will be done in 100 patients. Furthermore, in a subgroup of 20 patients, blood from a jugular bulb catheter will be drawn simultaneously with blood from the radial artery to measure the arterial to jugular venous concentration difference of lactate, in order to study the direction of cerebrovascular lactate flux. Functional clinical outcome will be determined by the modified Rankin Scale, length of stay and mortality at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year and 5 years. Clinical outcome will be compared between patients with and without hyperlactatemia. Multivariate logistic regression will be used to identify risk factors for hyperlactatemia. A statistical analysis plan will be publicized to support transparency and reproducibility. Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at international conferences."
https://openalex.org/W4286494012,"Background Anthropogenic changes in the environment are increasingly threatening the sustainability of socioecological systems on a global scale. As stewards of the natural capital of over a quarter of the world’s surface area, Indigenous Peoples (IPs), are at the frontline of these changes. Indigenous socioecological systems (ISES) are particularly exposed and sensitive to exogenous changes because of the intimate bounds of IPs with nature. Traditional food systems (TFS) represent one of the most prominent components of ISES, providing not only diverse and nutritious food but also critical socioeconomic, cultural, and spiritual assets. However, a proper understanding of how future climate change may compromise TFS through alterations of related human-nature interactions is still lacking. Climate change resilience of indigenous socioecological systems (RISE) is a new joint international project that aims to fill this gap in knowledge. Methods and design RISE will use a comparative case study approach coupling on-site socioeconomic, nutritional, and ecological surveys of the target ISES of Sakha (Republic of Sakha, Russian Federation) and Karen (Kanchanaburi, Thailand) people with statistical models projecting future changes in the distribution and composition of traditional food species under contrasting climate change scenarios. The results presented as alternative narratives of future climate change impacts on TFS will be integrated into a risk assessment framework to explore potential vulnerabilities of ISES operating through altered TFS, and possible adaptation options through stakeholder consultation so that lessons learned can be applied in practice. Discussion By undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the socioeconomic and nutritional contributions of TFS toward the sustainability of ISES and projecting future changes under alternative climate change scenarios, RISE is strategically designed to deliver novel and robust science that will contribute towards the integration of Indigenous issues within climate change and sustainable agendas while generating a forum for discussion among Indigenous communities and relevant stakeholders. Its goal is to promote positive co-management and regional development through sustainability and climate change adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W4286494129,"Adjuvant use of geraniol, a plant essential oil component, is known to increase the efficacy of antibiotics by acting as a potent inhibitor of efflux mechanisms. In this study, we assessed the effect of a geraniol-antibiotic combination in 21 Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates consisting of high efflux (HE) and low efflux (LE) activity groups. We determined the MIC for geraniol and the four antibiotics and evaluated the adjuvant antimicrobial activity and resensitization efficacy of adjuvant geraniol. Geraniol-antibiotic combinations significantly reduced the MIC of all four antibiotics (P < 0.0001), and the fold change in MIC decreased by 4 to >256-fold for tigecycline, >16 to >4,096-fold for ceftazidime, 1 to >4,096-fold for cefepime, and >2 to >4096-fold for ciprofloxacin. Importantly, geraniol showed adjuvant antimicrobial activity and resensitization efficacy when used in combination with antibiotics in 21 A. baumannii clinical isolates. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the HE and LE groups. Low concentrations (0.125% and 0.0625%) of geraniol showed no cytotoxic or hemolytic activity. Our study shows that geraniol, acting as an antibiotic adjuvant, is a good candidate for in vivo studies of combination therapy for the treatment of MDR/XDR A. baumannii infections."
https://openalex.org/W4286494538,"The hemodynamic benefit of novel arteriovenous graft (AVG) designs is typically assessed using computational models that assume highly idealized graft configurations and/or simplified boundary conditions representing the peripheral vasculature. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether idealized AVG models are suitable for hemodynamic evaluation of new graft designs, or whether more realistic models are required.An idealized and a realistic, clinical imaging based, parametrized AVG geometry were created. Furthermore, two physiological boundary condition models were developed to represent the peripheral vasculature. We assessed how graft geometry (idealized or realistic) and applied boundary condition models of the peripheral vasculature (physiological or distal zero-flow) impacted hemodynamic metrics related to AVG dysfunction.Anastomotic regions exposed to high WSS (>7, ≤40 Pa), very high WSS (>40 Pa) and highly oscillatory WSS were larger in the simulations using the realistic AVG geometry. The magnitude of velocity perturbations in the venous segment was up to 1.7 times larger in the realistic AVG geometry compared to the idealized one. When applying a (non-physiological zero-flow) boundary condition that neglected blood flow to and from the peripheral vasculature, we observed large regions exposed to highly oscillatory WSS. These regions could not be observed when using either of the newly developed distal boundary condition models.Hemodynamic metrics related to AVG dysfunction are highly dependent on the geometry and the distal boundary condition model used. Consequently, the hemodynamic benefit of a novel graft design can be misrepresented when using idealized AVG modelling setups."
https://openalex.org/W4286495798,"The success of any randomized clinical trial relies on the willingness of people to be recruited in the trial. However, 90% of all clinical trials worldwide have been reported to have failed to recruit the required number of trial participants within the scheduled time. This study aimed to qualitatively explore the motivations and barriers for healthy participants to participate in herbal remedy clinical trials in Tanzania.This study used a qualitative descriptive research design based on the theory of planned behaviour. A total of five Focus Group Discussions (FGD) were conducted at Bagamoyo Clinical Trial Facility from 29 to 30 May 2021. Each group consisted of 5 to 10 participants. The participants of the study were 30 healthy males aged 18 to 45 male who participated in the clinical trial that evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Maytenus Senegalensis. The focus group discussions were recorded audio-recorded. Verbatim transcription and thematic analysis were performed on the data.The prominent motivations mentioned were the opportunity for self-development, altruism, flexible study visit schedule, and financial compensation. Furthermore, the Participants' mothers and friends were reported as those most likely to approve of participation in an herbal remedy. The most mentioned barriers were inconvenience related to time commitment requirements, possible side effects, inflexible study visit schedule, and having other commitments. Moreover, the participants' father was reported to be more likely to disapprove of participation in a clinical trial of herbal remedy clinical trial.The results of this study showed that the motivations and barriers of healthy participants to participate in clinical trials of herbal remedies are varied and that participants are motivated by more than financial gains. The identified motivations and barriers can be used as a guideline to improve the design of recruitment and retention strategies for herbal remedy clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W4286500043,"Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), including the SERM/SERD bazedoxifene (BZA), are used to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis and may reduce breast cancer (BCa) risk. One of the most persistent unresolved questions regarding menopausal hormone therapy is compromised control of proliferation and phenotype because of short- or long-term administration of mixed-function estrogen receptor (ER) ligands. To gain insight into epigenetic effectors of the transcriptomes of hormone and BZA-treated BCa cells, we evaluated a panel of histone modifications. The impact of short-term hormone treatment and BZA on gene expression and genome-wide epigenetic profiles was examined in ERαneg mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) and ERα+ luminal breast cancer cells (MCF7). We tested individual components and combinations of 17β-estradiol (E2), estrogen compounds (EC10) and BZA. RNA-seq for gene expression and ChIP-seq for active (H3K4me3, H3K4ac, H3K27ac) and repressive (H3K27me3) histone modifications were performed. Our results show that the combination of BZA with E2 or EC10 reduces estrogen-mediated patterns of histone modifications and gene expression in MCF-7ERα+ cells. In contrast, BZA has minimal effects on these parameters in MCF10A mammary epithelial cells. BZA-induced changes in histone modifications in MCF7 cells are characterized by altered H3K4ac patterns, with changes at distal enhancers of ERα-target genes and at promoters of non-ERα bound proliferation-related genes. Notably, the ERα target gene GREB1 is the most sensitive to BZA treatment. Our findings provide direct mechanistic-based evidence that BZA induces epigenetic changes in E2 and EC10 mediated control of ERα regulatory programs to target distinctive proliferation gene pathways that restrain the potential for breast cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W4286500612,"Cervical cancer occurred nearly in 570 000 women and 311 000 women died from the disease worldwide in 2018. Of the new cases diagnosed globally in 2012, approximately 85% of the burden took place in low- and middle-income countries. Human Papilloma virus is the necessary cause for the development of cervical cancer and the majority of these infections resolves naturally but progress to precancerous lesions whenever there is persistence and delay in treatment. Majority of the cervical cancer cases, over 80% in sub-Saharan Africa including Ethiopia, have been detected at a late stage mainly due to poor early preventive measures. Therefore, utilization of early preventive measures could increase timely detection and treatment of precancerous changes and significantly reduce morbidity & mortality due to advanced disease.In this interventional study we will randomly assign 16 clusters (kebeles) in to the intervention and the control arm using block randomization. The study will employ a cluster randomized controlled trial. Women are eligible to participate in this study when they satisfy certain eligibility criteria; being in the age range of 30-49 years, no history of hysterectomy, did not receive cervical cancer or pre-cancer treatment and non-pregnant. Home based couple education and counseling will be provided to the eligible participants within the intervention group, while the control group receives standard of care. Base line and end line surveys will be completed by interviewing 288 eligible women to evaluate the effect of couple education and counseling on the knowledge, attitude and cervical cancer screening uptake. Generally the intervention lasts for six months. The results of baseline & end line surveys will be compared between the groups to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. Blinding is not possible due to the clustering of the trial arms.Findings of the study will inform the regional or national scale up of the intervention modality to achieve the screening targets set by the Ethiopian government and world health organization.PACTR, PACTR202108529472385.

https://openalex.org/W4286500802,"The development of the social public resource digital sharing system (SPRDSS) has been accelerated with the evolution of digital information and communication technologies (ICTs). This paper analyzes the dissipative structure features and formation process of SPRDSS in China. Combined with the Brusselator model and its transformation, this paper empirically analyzes the dissipative structure of SPRDSS using panel data collected from 30 Chinese provinces (excluding Tibet, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) from 2015 to 2019. The results show that the SPRDSS in China has pre-conditions to form a dissipative structure. At present, the SPRDSSs in most Chinese provinces have not yet formed the dissipative structure, but they are gradually evolving into it. The global orderliness of the sharing system is greater in eastern China than in central China and greater in central China than in western China. The potential for improving global orderliness is greater in western China than in central China and is greater in central China than in eastern China. Therefore, proper policies and measures should be adopted to accelerate the construction of SPRDSS based on the evolution of dissipative structure and to promote the sustainable development of the digital sharing economy."
