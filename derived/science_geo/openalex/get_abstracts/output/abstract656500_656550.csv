https://openalex.org/W3044482768,"A robust serological test to detect neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to determine not only the infection rate, herd immunity and predicted humoral protection, but also vaccine efficacy during clinical trials and after large-scale vaccination. The current gold standard is the conventional virus neutralization test requiring live pathogen and a biosafety level 3 laboratory. Here, we report a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test that detects total immunodominant neutralizing antibodies targeting the viral spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain in an isotype- and species-independent manner. Our simple and rapid test is based on antibody-mediated blockage of the interaction between the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor protein and the receptor-binding domain. The test, which has been validated with two cohorts of patients with COVID-19 in two different countries, achieves 99.93% specificity and 95–100% sensitivity, and differentiates antibody responses to several human coronaviruses. The surrogate virus neutralization test does not require biosafety level 3 containment, making it broadly accessible to the wider community for both research and clinical applications. A blocking assay based on the recombinant receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor provides an alternative to conventional antibody neutralization assays requiring live virus."
https://openalex.org/W3044914269,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to accelerated efforts to develop therapeutics and vaccines. A key target of these efforts is the spike (S) protein, which is metastable and difficult to produce recombinantly. We characterized 100 structure-guided spike designs and identified 26 individual substitutions that increased protein yields and stability. Testing combinations of beneficial substitutions resulted in the identification of HexaPro, a variant with six beneficial proline substitutions exhibiting higher expression than its parental construct (by a factor of 10) as well as the ability to withstand heat stress, storage at room temperature, and three freeze-thaw cycles. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of HexaPro at a resolution of 3.2 angstroms confirmed that it retains the prefusion spike conformation. High-yield production of a stabilized prefusion spike protein will accelerate the development of vaccines and serological diagnostics for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)."
https://openalex.org/W3045484639,"This study investigates students’ social networks and mental health before and at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, using longitudinal data collected since 2018. We analyze change on multiple dimensions of social networks (interaction, friendship, social support, co-studying) and mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness) within two cohorts of Swiss undergraduate students experiencing the crisis (N = 212), and make additional comparisons to an earlier cohort which did not experience the crisis (N = 54). In within-person comparisons we find that interaction and co-studying networks had become sparser, and more students were studying alone. Furthermore, students’ levels of stress, anxiety, loneliness, and depressive symptoms got worse, compared to measures before the crisis. Stressors shifted from fears of missing out on social life to worries about health, family, friends, and their future. Exploratory analyses suggest that COVID-19 specific worries, isolation in social networks, lack of interaction and emotional support, and physical isolation were associated with negative mental health trajectories. Female students appeared to have worse mental health trajectories when controlling for different levels of social integration and COVID-19 related stressors. As universities and researchers discuss future strategies on how to combine on-site teaching with online courses, our results indicate the importance of considering social contacts in students’ mental health and offer starting points to identify and support students at higher risk of social isolation and negative psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3044828974,"Lightweight, ultrathin, and flexible electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials are needed to protect electronic circuits and portable telecommunication devices and to eliminate cross-talk between devices and device components. Here, we show that a two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbonitride, Ti 3 CNT x MXene, with a moderate electrical conductivity, provides a higher shielding effectiveness compared with more conductive Ti 3 C 2 T x or metal foils of the same thickness. This exceptional shielding performance of Ti 3 CNT x was achieved by thermal annealing and is attributed to an anomalously high absorption of electromagnetic waves in its layered, metamaterial-like structure. These results provide guidance for designing advanced EMI shielding materials but also highlight the need for exploring fundamental mechanisms behind interaction of electromagnetic waves with 2D materials."

Borrelle et al. and Lau et al. discuss possible solutions and their impacts.

https://openalex.org/W3044468596,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil Brazil has been hard-hit by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Candido et al. combined genomic and epidemiological analyses to investigate the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in the country. By setting up a network of genomic laboratories using harmonized protocols, the researchers found a 29% positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 among collected samples. More than 100 international introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Brazil were identified, including three clades introduced from Europe that were already well established before the implementation of NPIs and travel bans. The virus spread from urban centers to the rest of the country, along with a 25% increase in the average distance traveled by air passengers before travel bans, despite an overall drop in short-haul travel. Unfortunately, the evidence confirms that current interventions remain insufficient to keep virus transmission under control in Brazil. Science , this issue p. 1255"
https://openalex.org/W3044030235,"Although complex inflammatory-like alterations are observed around the amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD), little is known about the molecular changes and cellular interactions that characterize this response. We investigate here, in an AD mouse model, the transcriptional changes occurring in tissue domains in a 100-μm diameter around amyloid plaques using spatial transcriptomics. We demonstrate early alterations in a gene co-expression network enriched for myelin and oligodendrocyte genes (OLIGs), whereas a multicellular gene co-expression network of plaque-induced genes (PIGs) involving the complement system, oxidative stress, lysosomes, and inflammation is prominent in the later phase of the disease. We confirm the majority of the observed alterations at the cellular level using in situ sequencing on mouse and human brain sections. Genome-wide spatial transcriptomics analysis provides an unprecedented approach to untangle the dysregulated cellular network in the vicinity of pathogenic hallmarks of AD and other brain diseases."

Antibodies that potently neutralize the virus hold promise as therapeutics and could inform vaccine design. Lv et al. report a humanized monoclonal antibody that protected against SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model. The cryo–electron microscopy structure, together with biochemical, cellular, and virological studies, showed that the antibody acts by binding to the receptor-binding domain of the spike and blocking its attachment to the host receptor.

https://openalex.org/W3044744859,"Natural gas has become the dominant source of electricity in the United States, and technologies capable of efficiently removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the flue emissions of natural gas-fired power plants could reduce their carbon intensity. However, given the low partial pressure of CO2 in the flue stream, separation of CO2 is particularly challenging. Taking inspiration from the crystal structures of diamine-appended metal-organic frameworks exhibiting two-step cooperative CO2 adsorption, we report a family of robust tetraamine-functionalized frameworks that retain cooperativity, leading to the potential for exceptional efficiency in capturing CO2 under the extreme conditions relevant to natural gas flue emissions. The ordered, multimetal coordination of the tetraamines imparts the materials with extraordinary stability to adsorption-desorption cycling with simulated humid flue gas and enables regeneration using low-temperature steam in lieu of costly pressure or temperature swings."

https://openalex.org/W3044240100,"The brain is a site of relative immune privilege. Although CD4 T cells have been reported in the central nervous system, their presence in the healthy brain remains controversial, and their function remains largely unknown. We used a combination of imaging, single cell, and surgical approaches to identify a CD69+ CD4 T cell population in both the mouse and human brain, distinct from circulating CD4 T cells. The brain-resident population was derived through in situ differentiation from activated circulatory cells and was shaped by self-antigen and the peripheral microbiome. Single-cell sequencing revealed that in the absence of murine CD4 T cells, resident microglia remained suspended between the fetal and adult states. This maturation defect resulted in excess immature neuronal synapses and behavioral abnormalities. These results illuminate a role for CD4 T cells in brain development and a potential interconnected dynamic between the evolution of the immunological and neurological systems. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W3044778276,"The rational design of enzymes is an important goal for both fundamental and practical reasons. Here, we describe a process to learn the constraints for specifying proteins purely from evolutionary sequence data, design and build libraries of synthetic genes, and test them for activity in vivo using a quantitative complementation assay. For chorismate mutase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, we demonstrate the design of natural-like catalytic function with substantial sequence diversity. Further optimization focuses the generative model toward function in a specific genomic context. The data show that sequence-based statistical models suffice to specify proteins and provide access to an enormous space of functional sequences. This result provides a foundation for a general process for evolution-based design of artificial proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3044502052,"Alloys that have high strengths at high temperatures are crucial for a variety of important industries including aerospace. Alloys with ordered superlattice structures are attractive for this purpose but generally suffer from poor ductility and rapid grain coarsening. We discovered that nanoscale disordered interfaces can effectively overcome these problems. Interfacial disordering is driven by multielement cosegregation that creates a distinctive nanolayer between adjacent micrometer-scale superlattice grains. This nanolayer acts as a sustainable ductilizing source, which prevents brittle intergranular fractures by enhancing dislocation mobilities. Our superlattice materials have ultrahigh strengths of 1.6 gigapascals with tensile ductilities of 25% at ambient temperature. Simultaneously, we achieved negligible grain coarsening with exceptional softening resistance at elevated temperatures. Designing similar nanolayers may open a pathway for further optimization of alloy properties."

Whether and how the brain constructs a cognitive map of abstract relationships among discrete entities from piecemeal experiences is unclear. A powerful advantage of a cognitive map of an environment or task is the ability to make inferences from sparse observations that can dramatically accelerate learning and even guide novel decisions (Banino et al., 2018Banino A.

This is partly because a cognitive map of a task space would in theory allows shortcuts and novel routes to be inferred, as in a physical space. To provide a concrete example, understanding the structure of family trees allows one to infer new relationships without ever directly learning these relationships, such as the following: because Sally is John’s sister and Sue is John’s daughter, Sue must be Sally’s niece (Figure 1A). Biologically inspired computational models show the map-like coding schemes found in HC and EC can in principle enable agents to perform vector navigation, including planning new routes and finding shortcuts to a goal in physical space (Banino et al., 2018Banino A.

Moreover, whether this proposed OFC function would extend to representing a cognitive map of an abstract social space or instead transfer to areas implicated in social cognition is unclear. In addition to representing cognitive maps, both HC and OFC have been implicated in model-based inference, such that distinct stimuli, or stimuli and rewards, that were not directly associated can be associated or integrated through an overlapping, shared associate (Jones et al., 2012Jones J.L.

When logic fails: implicit transitive inference in humans.Mem. Cognit. 2005; 33: 742-750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to demonstrations that the HC-EC system is necessary for transitive inferences (Dusek and Eichenbaum, 1997Dusek J.A. Eichenbaum H. The hippocampus and memory for orderly stimulus relations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), studies in animal models have demonstrated that OFC is necessary for model-based inferences based on previously learned associations, but not for decisions based on directly learned cached values (Jones et al., 2012Jones J.L. Esber G.R. McDannald M.A. Gruber A.J. Hernandez A. Mirenzi A. Schoenbaum G. Orbitofrontal cortex supports behavior and learning using inferred but not cached values.Science. 2012; 338: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although these HC-EC and OFC roles for associating or integrating individual items have been documented, how the brain constructs broader cognitive maps and makes direct inferences beyond chaining or integrating previously experienced elementary associations has been elusive. In particular, it is possible that similar mechanisms of integration and/or distinct mechanisms that leverage an explicit representation of the relational structure of the space or task (Whittington et al., 2019Whittington J.C. Muller T.H. Mark S. Chen G. Barry C. Burgess N. Behrens T.E.J. The Tolman-Eichenbaum Machine: Unifying space and relational memory through generalisation in the hippocampal formation.bioRxiv. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1101/770495Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar) would allow for the integration of distinct relational structures into a single larger cognitive map from sparse observations (e.g., the integration of family trees through marriage) that even respects metric relationships (e.g., vector directions and distances) and enables direct inferences that have not been experienced previously (e.g., Sue is Sally’s niece) (Figure 1A). Here, we asked participants to learn two 2D social hierarchies from the outcomes of binary decisions about individuals’ rank on either of the two dimensions, with each dimension learned on a different day. During fMRI, participants were asked to make novel inferences about the relative status of a novel pair across hierarchies in only one dimension at a time. This manipulation meant subjects were required to flexibly switch between currently relevant and irrelevant social dimensions that described the same entities for decisions. We tested two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses concerning how the human brain could represent and flexibly switch between dimensions that characterize the same entities to guide direct inferences. Based on previous decision-making studies showing behaviorally relevant decision value signals in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)/mOFC, and pending or currently irrelevant value signals in separate prefrontal areas (Boorman et al., 2009Boorman E.D.

Integration of individual and social information for decision-making in groups of different sizes.PLoS Biol. 2017; 15: e2001958Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), one hypothesis predicts that neural activity in vmPFC/mOFC, and the HC-EC system (Figure 1B), would depend on the current behaviorally relevant dimension alone, whereas other prefrontal areas may simultaneously reflect the currently irrelevant dimension (Figure 1C). However, if relationships between people are projected into a unitary space defined by their respective values on two independent dimensions, then we would predict a single neural representation in vmPFC/mOFC and the HC-EC system such that behavioral and neural activity reflect the Euclidean distance over a 2D space between entities, rather than the behaviorally relevant 1D rank alone (Figure 1D). We asked participants to learn the status of unfamiliar people in two separate groups organized hierarchically on two orthogonal dimensions: competence and popularity (Figure 2A). Importantly, participants never saw the 1D or 2D hierarchies. Instead, they were able to learn the relative ranks of neighboring people who differed by only one level on one dimension at a time through a series of feedback-based dyadic comparisons and use transitive inferences to infer the remaining ranks (see Kumaran et al., 2012Kumaran D. Melo H.L. Duzel E. The emergence and representation of knowledge about social and nonsocial hierarchies.Neuron. 2012; 76: 653-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). During the first two days of training (Figure 2C), participants learned the relative status of two groups of eight entrepreneurs separately on only one dimension per day (Figure S1A for day 1 training and Figure S1B for day 2 training). For the third day of training, fMRI participants learned from select hubs enabling between-group comparisons between people in each group for the first time (Figure S1C). By limiting between-group comparisons only to hubs (Figures S1D and S1E), we were able to create comparative paths connecting each of the individuals in different groups, which could be leveraged to perform inferences between novel pairs between groups. We analyzed fMRI data acquired from 27 subjects who successfully learned the relative ranks of the two social hierarchies (>85% performance criterion in both dimensions, tested on day 2 training). In each fMRI trial, participants were asked to make a binary decision about who had higher rank in one or the other dimension between a first face (F1) and second face (F2) presented sequentially (Figure 2B). These faces were selected from different groups and were not hubs in the relevant dimension (non-hubs) (Figure S1F), meaning they had not been previously compared. Therefore, successful inferences could rely on building an internal representation of the social hierarchies and a relational memory of the relative positions of F1, F2, and the hub. We predicted that the inference is made along a trajectory connecting the two individuals via the (unseen) hub (Figures 2B and 2D; Figure S1G). Participants were able to successfully infer the relative position of these novel pairs of individuals (mean accuracy ± SEM = 93.6% ± 0.77%). Nonetheless, the shorter the distance between individuals, the more difficult the decision about relative positions in the hierarchy. To examine the effects of distance of potential trajectories on decision making, we regressed choice reaction times (RTs) on different distance measures using a multiple linear regression model, thereby allowing them to compete to explain RT variance. We included the Euclidean distance from the hub (H2) to F1 (EH2F1), the Euclidean distance from the other hub (H1) to F2 (EH1F2), the relative rank in the task-relevant dimension, which is the 1D distance between H2 and F1 (DH2F1), the 1D distance between H1 and F2 (DH1F2) (Figure 2D), as well as both 1D and 2D distances between F1 and F2 (DF1F2 and EF1F2, respectively) (Figure 2E), to control for their possible covariation with hub-related distances. We found that the greater the 1D and 2D Euclidean distance between F1 and H2 (DH2F1 and EH2F1, respectively), the faster the RT (βDH2F1 ± SEM = −52.9 ± 11.9, t26 = −4.5, p = 4.5e−05; βEH2F1 ± SEM = −49.4 ± 5.7, t26 = −8.8, p = 0.003), in addition to an effect of the 1D distance in the relevant dimension between F1 and F2 (DF1F2) (βDF1F2 ± SEM = −64.6 ± 12.5, t26 = −5.3, p = 0.0002) (Figure 2F; see Figures S2C and S2D for confirmatory and control analyses). Our behavioral results show that participants preferentially recall H2 as the task-relevant hub to aid in the comparison between novel pairs of faces, with the Euclidean distance to H2 explaining variance beyond the 1D distance alone. To examine whether neural activity during choices was likewise modulated by the distance of inference trajectories via the hub over in a 2D space, first, we regressed blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity at the time of the inference (F2) against the parametric regressors of Euclidean distance between the hub and the target face (EH2F1 and EH1F2) and their (cosine) vector angles (AH2F1 and AH1F2). We first tested for effects in a priori regions of interest (ROIs) that combined multiple anatomically defined ROIs, including bilateral HC, EC, and vmPFC/mOFC (Figure 1B). We found neural correlates of the Euclidean distance of the decision trajectory via H2 (EH2F1) in vmPFC/mOFC (peak"

For example, cell size determines the spatial scale of organelles and intracellular transport and thereby affects biosynthesis. Although some genes that affect mammalian cell size have been identified, the molecular mechanisms through which cell growth drives cell division have remained elusive. We show that cell growth during the G1 phase of the cell division cycle dilutes the cell cycle inhibitor Retinoblastoma protein (Rb) to trigger division in human cells. RB overexpression increased cell size and G1 duration, whereas RB deletion decreased cell size and removed the inverse correlation between cell size at birth and the duration of the G1 phase. Thus, Rb dilution through cell growth in G1 provides one of the long-sought molecular mechanisms that promotes cell size homeostasis."

We find that Rab32 interacts with IRG1 on Salmonella infection and facilitates the delivery of itaconate to the Salmonella-containing vacuole. Mice defective in IRG1 rescued the virulence defect of a S. enterica serovar Typhimurium mutant specifically defective in its ability to counter the Rab32 defense mechanism. These studies provide a link between a metabolite produced in the mitochondria after stimulation of innate immune receptors and a cell-autonomous defense mechanism that restricts the replication of an intracellular bacterial pathogen."

In cellular models, five excipients had fingerprints predictive of system-level toxicity.

What sustains their pluripotency during propagation remains unclear. Here, we show that core pluripotency factors OCT4 and SOX2 suppress chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective form of autophagy, until the initiation of differentiation. Low CMA activity promotes embryonic stem cell self-renewal, whereas its up-regulation enhances differentiation. CMA degrades isocitrate dehydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2 and reduces levels of intracellular α-ketoglutarate, an obligatory cofactor for various histone and DNA demethylases involved in pluripotency. These findings suggest that CMA mediates the effect of core pluripotency factors on metabolism, shaping the epigenetic landscape of stem cells and governing the balance between self-renewal and differentiation."

In a related species, these loci are found in a region of suppressed recombination, forming a supergene. However, in seven species of Timema, we found that a megabase-size ""supermutation"" has deleted color loci in green morphs. Moreover, we found that balancing selection likely contributes more to maintaining this mutation than does introgression. Our results show how suppressed recombination and large-scale mutation can help to package gene complexes into discrete units of diversity such as morphs, ecotypes, or species."
https://openalex.org/W3044516346,"The diagnosis of patients with malignancies relies on the results of a clinical cytological examination. To enhance the diagnostic qualities of cytological examinations, it is important to have a detailed analysis of the cell’s characteristics. There is, therefore, a need for developing a new auxiliary method for cytological diagnosis. In this study, we focused on studying the charge of the cell membrane surface of fixed cells, which is one of important cell’s characteristics. Although fixed cells lose membrane potential which is observed in living cells owing to ion dynamics, we hypothesized that fixed cells still have a cell membrane surface charge due to cell membrane components and structure. We used 5 cell lines in this study (ARO, C32TG, RT4, TK, UM-UC-14). After fixation with CytoRich Red, we measured the cell membrane surface charge of fixed cells in solution using zeta potential measurements and fixed cells on glass slides, visualizing it using antibody-labeled beads and positively-charged beads. Furthermore, we measured the cell membrane surface charge of fixed cells under different conditions, such as different solution of fixative, ion concentration, pH, and pepsin treatments. The zeta potential measurements and visualization using the beads indicated that the cell membrane surface of fixed cells was negatively charged, and also that the charge varied among fixed cells. The charge state was affected by the different treatments. Moreover, the number of cell-bound beads was small in interphase, anaphase, and apoptotic cells. We concluded that the negative cell membrane surface charge was influenced by the three-dimensional structure of proteins as well as the different types of amino acids and lipids on the cell membrane. Thus, cell surface charge visualization can be applied as a new auxiliary method for clinical cytological diagnosis. This is the first systematic report of the cell membrane surface charge of fixed cells."

A hallmark of human CatSper is its polymodal activation by membrane voltage, intracellular pH, and oviductal hormones. Whether CatSper is also activated by signaling pathways involving an increase of cAMP and ensuing activation of PKA is, however, a matter of controversy. To shed light on this question, we used kinetic ion-sensitive fluorometry, patch-clamp recordings, and optochemistry to study transmembrane Ca2+ flux and membrane currents in human sperm from healthy donors and from patients that lack functional CatSper channels. We found that human CatSper is neither activated by intracellular cAMP directly nor indirectly by the cAMP/PKA-signaling pathway. Instead, we show that nonphysiological concentrations of cAMP and membrane-permeable cAMP analogs used to mimic the action of intracellular cAMP activate human CatSper from the outside via a hitherto-unknown extracellular binding site. Finally, we demonstrate that the effects of common PKA inhibitors on human CatSper rest predominantly, if not exclusively, on off-target drug actions on CatSper itself rather than on inhibition of PKA. We conclude that the concept of an intracellular cAMP/PKA-activation of CatSper is primarily based on unspecific effects of chemical probes used to interfere with cAMP signaling.

These results indicate that mouse and human CatSper are neither activated by cAMP directly nor indirectly via activation of PKA, and that activation of CatSper by membrane-permeable cAMP derivatives might represent a nonspecific action of these compounds in sperm.

The exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by LAB affect positively the technological and nutritional properties of the bread, while phytases improve the bioavailability of the minerals by reducing its phytate content. In the present study, a pool of 152 cereal-sourced LAB were screened for production of phytases and EPS for potential use as sourdough starter cultures for the baking industry. There was large heterogeneity in the phytase activity observed among the screened isolates, with 95% showing the ability to degrade sodium phytate on plates containing Sourdough Simulation Medium (SSM). The isolates Lactobacillus brevis LD65 and Lactobacillus plantarum PB241 showed the highest enzymatic activity, while the isolates ascribed to Weissella confusa were characterized by low or no phytase activity. Only 18% of the screened LAB produced EPS, which were distinguished as ropy or mucoid phenotypes on SSM supplemented with sucrose. Almost all the EPS producers carried one or more genes (epsD/E and/or epsA) involved in the production of heteropolysaccharides (HePS), whereas the isolates ascribed to Leuconostoc citreum and W. confusa carried genes involved in the production of both HePS and homopolysaccharides (HoPS). Monosaccharide composition analysis of the EPS produced by a selected subset of isolates revealed that all the HePS included glucose, mannose, and galactose, though at different ratios. Furthermore, a few isolates ascribed to L. citreum and W. confusa and carrying the gtf gene produced β-glucans after fermentation in an ad hoc formulated barley flour medium. Based on the overall results collected, a subset of candidate sourdough starter cultures for the baking industry was selected, including Lb. brevis LD66 and L. citreum PB220, which showed high phytase activity and positive EPS production."

How the cortex interacts with the thalamus to implement its functions remains poorly understood. A crucial step is to understand how individual cortical areas regulate thalamic activity through their corticothalamic projections. Corticothalamic projections have been demonstrated to strongly influence thalamic activity in various mammalian species, including primates, cats, and rodents (Alexander and Fuster, 1973Alexander G.E.

Nevertheless, there is no systematic study to map the causal contribution of cortical activity to thalamic activity (defined here as functional corticothalamic connectivity [FCC]). It remains challenging to create a comprehensive functional corticothalamic map from individual cortical regions to each thalamic nucleus because the cortex and thalamus have extensive projections to each other (Harris et al., 2019Harris J.A. Mihalas S. Hirokawa K.E. Whitesell J.D. Choi H. Bernard A. Bohn P. Caldejon S. Casal L.

Cortex. 1999; 9: 277-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and thus, inhibiting one cortical region will inevitably affect a wide range of cortical and thalamic areas at a longer timescale. Physical lesions, pharmacological manipulations, and cooling methods do not have sufficient temporal resolution to differentiate the direct and indirect effects (Hikosaka and Wurtz, 1985Hikosaka O. Wurtz R.H. Modification of saccadic eye movements by GABA-related substances. I. Effect of muscimol and bicuculline in monkey superior colliculus.J.

Integrating motion and depth via parallel pathways.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, dissecting the direct effects will require a method to perturb and monitor neural activity with milliseconds of temporal resolution. Next, monitoring thalamic activity requires recording neural activity from deep brain areas, necessitating a method to accurately reconstruct the electrode locations in order to assign the recorded neurons to individual thalamic nuclei that are densely packed. Furthermore, both the cortex and thalamus have dozens of distinct areas spanning millimeters in space, requiring a high throughput method to perturb neural activity in many cortical regions repeatedly while simultaneously recording thalamic activity from multiple thalamic sites. Lastly, collecting, analyzing, and presenting large electrophysiological datasets from many thalamic nuclei remains challenging. Here, we developed a high throughput pipeline by combining optogenetic local cortical inactivation with thalamic multi-channel recording to systematically map FCC in awake mice. Optogenetic inactivation allowed us to reversibly silence ∼1 mm3 cortical tissue with milliseconds of temporal resolution (Deisseroth, 2015Deisseroth K.

A galvo scanning system enabled targeting 34 cortical regions (∼50% of neocortex) repeatedly in an addressable coordinate system (Guo et al., 2014bGuo Z.V. Li N. Huber D. Ophir E. Gutnisky D. Ting J.T. Feng G. Svoboda K. Flow of cortical activity underlying a tactile decision in mice.Neuron. 2014; 81: 179-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Silicon probes with multi-recording channels collected neural activity from dozens of neurons at one thalamic location. We imaged the recorded brains with electrode tracks at micrometer resolution and aligned the brains to the Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) (Wang et al., 2020Wang Q. Ding S.L. Li Y. Royall J. Feng D. Lesnar P. Graddis N. Naeemi M. Facer B. Ho A. et al.The Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework: A 3D Reference Atlas.Cell. 2020; 181: 936-953.e20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By combining information from CCF, we analyzed the dynamic response of thalamic neurons to inactivation of one of 34 cortical regions. Our results present a framework for collecting, analyzing, and presenting region-specific optogenetic perturbations combined with large electrophysiological datasets. Inactivation of the sensory, motor, and association cortices suppressed thalamic activity with a short latency. FCC from these cortices showed topographical organization, with the anterior cortex preferentially projecting to the ventral and medial part of individual thalamic nuclei and the lateral part of the cortex preferentially projecting to the lateral and posterior part of individual thalamic nuclei. Cluster analysis revealed that different sets of thalamic neurons received distinct patterns of cortical inputs and exhibited different temporal dynamics following cortical inactivation. Interestingly, a subset of thalamic neurons received convergent innervations from the sensory, motor, and association cortices, implying that these neurons might function to integrate diverse cortical information. Given the widespread corticothalamic, thalamocortical, and corticocortical connections (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991Felleman D.J. Van Essen D.C.

We inactivated individual cortical regions while simultaneously recording from multiple thalamic locations to probe FCC (Figure 1A). Optogenetic inactivation was achieved by photostimulating a red-shifted cruxhalorhodopsin (Jaws) in pyramidal neurons in a triple transgenic mouse line Emx1-IRES-Cre; Camk2a-tTA; Ai79 (Figure 1B) (Chuong et al., 2014Chuong A.S.

To efficiently map FCC, we employed a galvo scanning system to target photostimuli repeatedly in a random-access manner to 34 cortical locations (covering ∼50% of the neocortex; Figures 1A, 1C, and S1F) (Guo et al., 2014bGuo Z.V.

Flow of cortical activity underlying a tactile decision in mice.Neuron. 2014; 81: 179-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In parallel to inactivation, we recorded extracellular activity with a 64-channel silicon probe across multiple thalamic nuclei. We advanced the silicon probe to record from a new set of thalamic locations in the same mouse between sessions (∼5 sessions per probe insertion; Figure 2A). Combining the two approaches effectively increased the throughput ∼200 times, compared with the approach using a single cortical region inactivation and a single thalamic location recording, to enable efficiently survey of FCC (Figures 1C and 1D).Figure 23D Reconstruction of Electrode LocationsShow full caption(A) The pipeline for 3D reconstruction of electrode tracks.

To characterize the spatial and temporal profile of inactivation, we recorded single units from SSp in awake mice (Figures 1E–1G and S1A–D). The spike widths (from trough to peak) formed a bimodal distribution that allowed the isolation of putative pyramidal neurons (Figure S1A) (Guo et al., 2014bGuo Z.V. Li N. Huber D. Ophir E. Gutnisky D. Ting J.T. Feng G. Svoboda K. Flow of cortical activity underlying a tactile decision in mice.Neuron. 2014; 81: 179-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Inactivation powerfully suppressed neural activity near the laser spot center (activity reduction: 86.3% ± 3.0%, 16 mW laser; 88.9% ± 3.2%, 32 mW, mean ± SEM, laser distance < 0.2 mm; Figures 1E, 1F, S1B, and S1C). The laser power at the dura of the cortex was ∼8 or 16 mW, because the light transmission efficiency was ∼50% (Guo et al., 2014bGuo Z.V. Li N. Huber D. Ophir E. Gutnisky D. Ting J.T. Feng G. Svoboda K. Flow of cortical activity underlying a tactile decision in mice.Neuron. 2014; 81: 179-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This would not produce undesired heating effects, because the laser spot only lasts for 0.4 s (Stujenske et al., 2015Stujenske J.M. Spellman T. Gordon J.A. Modeling the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Light and Heat Propagation for In Vivo Optogenetics.Cell Rep. 2015; 12: 525-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Inactivation suppressed neural activity with a short latency (1.4 ± 0.3 ms after laser onset, mean ± SEM, laser power 32 mW; Figure S1D). The suppression was potent even in deep cortical layers (>90% in layer 5 [L5] neurons, >50% in L6 neurons, 16mW laser power; Figure 1F). Inactivation was local, having a half-max width of 0.67 or 1.26 mm for L5 and L6 neurons at 16 or 32 mW, respectively (Figure 1G). Based on this spatial profile, inactivation locations were chosen uniformly distributed across the dorsal cortex (mean distance, 0.80 ± 0.08 mm, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p > 0.05; Figures S1E–S1G). The mouse thalamus sits deep in the brain, and it is difficult to target specific nuclei due to the uncertainty in determining the recording location. Here, we developed a data collection and analyses pipeline to reconstruct electrode tracks with high precision (Figure 2A; see STAR Methods). First, we painted a thin layer of DiI on the silicon probe before recording, and the DiI fluorescence enabled the visualization of the electrode tracks post hoc. Second, we delivered a brief electric pulse (20 μA for 1 s, 3 to 4 times) to make a small lesion near the tip of the probe. Third, we sectioned and imaged the coronal brain slices from the anterior to posterior thalamus. Fourth, we manually traced the boundary of the thalamus, generated a binary mask, and after tilt correction, aligned it in CCF. During this step, we also marked the electrode tracks and lesion locations. Finally, we stacked the aligned slice masks to generate a 3D thalamus and mapped it to the model thalamus in CCF through rigid transformation (Hunnicutt et al., 2014Hunnicutt B.J. Long B.R. Kusefoglu D. Gertz K.J. Zhong H. Mao T. A comprehensive thalamocortical projection map at the mesoscopic level.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1276-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We estimated the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction using two complementary approaches. First, we compared the boundary distance between the reconstructed thalamus and model thalamus in CCF. The average distance was 72.4 ± 5.1 μm (mean ± SEM), suggesting that our approach had an error less than 100 μm (Figure 2B). Second, we checked the accuracy by taking advantage of neurophysiological landmarks in the thalamus. Neurons in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus (RT) are GABAergic, and neurons in other thalamic nuclei are mostly glutamatergic. We sorted 382 single units near the boundary of the RT and the neighboring nuclei, including the ventral anterior lateral nucleus (VAL) and the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) (Figure 2C). The spike widths formed a bimodal distribution that allowed to isolate putative RT neurons (and GABAergic axons) from thalamic projection neurons (Figures S2A and S2B) (Barthó et al., 2014Barthó P.

The fraction of thin spikes in VAL or VPL was low, and the probability of finding narrow spiking neurons increased from ∼0 to 1 along the electrode tracks into RT (Figures 2C and 2D). We estimated the VAL-VPL and RT boundary at half-max of the probability finding narrow spiking neurons. This yielded an error of 88.5 ± 81.1 μm (VAL) and 50.6 ± 28.9 μm (VPL) from the anatomical boundary, indicating that our data collection and analyses pipeline produced a consistent estimation of recording locations (Figure 2E). With the above pipeline, we collected spikes from 19,690 recording sites across 548 sessions from 43 mice. The recording sites covered 47 thalamic nuclei (94% of total thalamic nuclei; see Table S1 for a full list of thalamic nuclei; Figure 2F). From the recording sites, we sorted 13,441 single units, including 11,836 putative thalamic units and 847 putative inhibitory units (see STAR Methods; Figures S2C and S2D). We analyzed FCC using both multi-unit activity (MUA) and single-unit activity (SUA). We focused on MUA when analyzing population activity, because there were more recording sites, and MUA analyses produced similar results (Figures 3, 4A–4D, 5, 7, S3A–S3I, S3K–S3M, S4B, S5, and S7), and we checked SUA when concerning FCC for individual thalamic neurons (Figures 4E, 6, S3J, S3N, S4C–S4J, and S6). The baseline activity had a wide distribution, with the ventral, geniculate, lateral, and anterior groups of nuclei and RT (e.g., VAL, VPL, LGd-sh, POL, LD, IGL, and RT; SUA > 9.8 spikes/s) having higher activity compared with nuclei adjacent to the midline (e.g., SPFm, SPA, Xi, and PVT; SUA < 5.2 spikes/s; Figures S2E and S2F).Figure 4Topographical Organization of Direct FCC to RTShow full caption(A) Spatial distribution of RT recording sites inhibited by inactivation of indicated cortical area (MOs n = 452; MOp n = 363; SSp n = 511; RSPd n = 179; PTLp n = 235; VIS n = 267; including overlapping sites).

Present methods to structure the near field rely on optical antenna theory, involving nanostructures that locally convert propagating waves into confined near-field patterns. We developed a theory of remote rather than local near-field shaping, based on cascaded mode conversion and interference of counterpropagating guided waves with different propagation constants. We demonstrate how to structure at will the longitudinal and transverse variation of the near field, allowing for distributions beyond the conventional monotonic decay of the evanescent field. We provide an experimental realization that confirms our theory. Our method applies to fields with arbitrary polarization states and mode profiles, providing a path toward three-dimensional control of the near field."

https://openalex.org/W3045442280,"Microbial rhodopsins are versatile and ubiquitous retinal-binding proteins that function as light-driven ion pumps, light-gated ion channels, and photosensors, with potential utility as optogenetic tools for altering membrane potential in target cells. Insights from crystal structures have been central for understanding proton, sodium, and chloride transport mechanisms of microbial rhodopsins. Two of three known groups of anion pumps, the archaeal halorhodopsins (HRs) and bacterial chloride-pumping rhodopsins, have been structurally characterized. Here we report the structure of a representative of a recently discovered third group consisting of cyanobacterial chloride and sulfate ion-pumping rhodopsins, the Mastigocladopsis repens rhodopsin (MastR). Chloride-pumping MastR contains in its ion transport pathway a unique Thr-Ser-Asp (TSD) motif, which is involved in the binding of a chloride ion. The structure reveals that the chloride-binding mode is more similar to HRs than chloride-pumping rhodopsins, but the overall structure most closely resembles bacteriorhodopsin (BR), an archaeal proton pump. The MastR structure shows a trimer arrangement reminiscent of BR-like proton pumps and shows features at the extracellular side more similar to BR than the other chloride pumps. We further solved the structure of the MastR-T74D mutant, which contains a single amino acid replacement in the TSD motif. We provide insights into why this point mutation can convert the MastR chloride pump into a proton pump but cannot in HRs. Our study points at the importance of precise coordination and exact location of the water molecule in the active center of proton pumps, which serves as a bridge for the key proton transfer."
https://openalex.org/W3044134563,"Renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) is a common pathological feature of aristolochic acid (AA) nephropathy (AAN). G2/M arrest of proximal tubular cells (PTCs) is implicated in renal fibrosis of AAN, but the upstream regulatory molecule remains unknown. Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) promotes renal fibrosis in kidney disease, but the role of HIF-1α in AAN is unclear. Evidence shows that HIF-1α and p21, a known inducer of cellular G2/M arrest, are closely related to each other. To investigate the role of HIF-1α in renal fibrosis of AAN and its effects on p21 expression and PTCs G2/M arrest, mice with HIF-1α gene knockout PTCs (PT-HIF-1α-KO) were generated, and AAN was induced by AA. In vitro tests were conducted on the human PTCs line HK-2 and primary mouse PTCs. HIF-1α and p21 expression, fibrogenesis, and G2/M arrest of PTCs were determined. Results showed that HIF-1α was upregulated in the kidneys of wild-type (WT) AAN mice, accompanied by p21 upregulation, PTCs G2/M arrest and renal fibrosis, and these alterations were reversed in PT-HIF-1α-KO AAN mice. Similar results were observed in HK-2 cells and were further confirmed in primary PTCs from PT-HIF-1α-KO and WT mice. Inhibiting p21 in HK-2 cells and primary PTCs did not change the expression of HIF-1α, but G2/M arrest and fibrogenesis were reduced. These data indicate that HIF-1α plays a key role in renal fibrosis in AAN by inducing PTCs G2/M arrest modulated through p21. HIF-1α may serve as a potential therapeutic target for AAN."
https://openalex.org/W3045441955,"The angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT1R), a member of the G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) family, signals through G proteins and β-arrestins, which act as adaptors to regulate AT1R internalization and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1/2 activation. β-arrestin–dependent ERK1/2 regulation is the subject of important studies because its spatiotemporal control remains poorly understood for many GPCRs, including AT1R. To study the link between β-arrestin–dependent trafficking and ERK1/2 signaling, we investigated three naturally occurring AT1R variants that show distinct receptor–β-arrestin interactions: A163T, T282M, and C289W. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)–based and conformational fluorescein arsenical hairpin–BRET sensors coupled with high-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we show that all AT1R variants form complexes with β-arrestin2 at the plasma membrane and efficiently internalize into endosomes upon AngII stimulation. However, mutant receptors imposed distinct conformations in β-arrestin2 and differentially impacted endosomal trafficking and MAPK signaling. Notably, T282M accumulated in endosomes, but its ability to form stable complexes following internalization was reduced, markedly impairing its ability to co-traffic with β-arrestin2. We also found that despite β-arrestin2 overexpression, T282M's and C289W's residency with β-arrestin2 in endosomes was greatly reduced, leading to decreased β-arrestin–dependent ERK1/2 activation, faster recycling of receptors to the plasma membrane, and impaired AngII-mediated proliferation. Our findings reveal that naturally occurring AT1R variants alter the patterns of receptor/β-arrestin2 trafficking and suggest conformationally dependent β-arrestin–mediated MAPK activation as well as endosomal receptor–β-arrestin complex stabilization in the mitogenic response of AT1R.

G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) transmit signals conveyed by extracellular stimuli such as proteins, hormones, small molecules, neurotransmitters, and ions by engaging G proteins and other signaling effectors inside cells (1Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. Mammalian G proteins and their cell type specific functions.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85 (16183910): 1159-120410.1152/physrev.00003.2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Their signaling is tightly regulated by a family of intracellular proteins known as arrestins (arrestin2 and arrestin3, also known as β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2, respectively) through binding to agonist-activated GPCRs that have been phosphorylated by GPCR kinases, and terminate G protein-mediated signaling at the plasma membrane (PM) (for review, see Refs. 2Pierce K.L.

Receptor-bound β-arrestins also act as endocytic adaptors by interacting with components of the clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV), such as clathrin and AP-2, and initiate GPCR internalization from the PM (6Goodman Jr., O.B.

Receptor-containing CCVs are pinched off from the PM by dynamin GTPases and fuse with larger endosomes, where receptors are either sorted for recycling to the PM or trafficked to other intracellular compartments for recycling or degradation (5Laporte S.A.

Engagement of β-arrestins to agonist-activated receptors at the PM is a general property of nearly all GPCRs, but the outcomes of such GPCR–β-arrestin complexes vary markedly among receptors. Depending on the strength of the interaction of β-arrestins with receptors, which influences their trafficking profiles, GPCRs can be divided into two distinct classes, colloquially referred to as Class A and B (9Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Differential affinities of visual arrestin, βarrestin1, and βarrestin2 for G protein-coupled receptors delineate two major classes of receptors.J. Biol.

Class A GPCRs, such as the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), are characterized by their transient interaction with β-arrestins. Once internalized, β2AR–β-arrestin complexes rapidly dissociate at or near the PM before receptors traffic into endosomes (9Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Differential affinities of visual arrestin, βarrestin1, and βarrestin2 for G protein-coupled receptors delineate two major classes of receptors.J. Biol.

These receptors then rapidly recycle back to the PM where they regain their signaling functions. In contrast, class B GPCRs, such as the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R), and bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R), are characterized by their ability to form long-lived complexes with β-arrestins and traffic into endosomes once internalized (9Oakley R.H.

These stable complexes in endosomes slow the rate of receptor recycling, ultimately leading to a decline in receptor density and signaling at the PM.

The amplitude of MAPK signaling is therefore contingent on the relative contribution of the G protein– versus β-arrestin–dependent pathways, as well as the relative expression of the effectors of these pathways and their efficient engagement in cells (18Luttrell L.M.

Subcellular compartmentalization and stabilization of GPCR–β-arrestin complexes with components of the MAPK pathway also play important and differential roles in ERK1/2 activation. For the B2R, β-arrestin–mediated ERK1/2 activation has been shown to occur both at the PM and in endosomes (10Zimmerman B. Simaan M. Akoume M.Y. Houri N. Chevallier S. Séguéla P. Laporte S.A.

The stable formation of V2R–β-arrestin complexes also contributes to the sustained ERK1/2 activation (20Tohgo A. Choy E.W. Gesty-Palmer D. Pierce K.L. Laporte S. Oakley R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

However, the incidence of β-arrestin–mediated ERK1/2 signaling at the PM, as well as the need to stabilizing receptor–β-arrestin complexes into endosomes for sustained ERK1/2 activation, are unclear in the case of AT1R. We investigated three naturally occurring variants of AT1R: A163T, T282M, and C289W (A4.60T, T7.33M, and C7.40W, as defined by Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering, respectively), which we previously showed to distinctly interact with β-arrestin (24Namkung Y.

These mutations are located in the transmembrane (TM) region of the AT1R (A163T in TM4, T282M and C289W in TM7), which we suspected would likely affect the stabilization of distinct receptor conformations once engaged by ligands and thus alter β-arrestin interactions. A163T (rs12721226, National Library of Medicine, NCBI database) is a variant discovered in humans that has normal physiological properties with the endogenous ligand AngII, but has significantly reduced affinity to the antagonist losartan (25Arsenault J.

T282M and C289W (rs104893677 and rs1064533, respectively) are rare mutations, where T282M has been linked to renal tubular dysgenesis and C289W has been shown to decrease AT1R's affinity to AngII (27Gribouval O.

Here, we demonstrate that these naturally occurring mutations convert, in some cases, AT1R from a class B to a class A GPCR in terms of their interactions and trafficking behavior with β-arrestin and negatively affected β-arrestin2–mediated ERK1/2 signaling in endosomes. Importantly, our findings indicate that sustained β-arrestin–mediated MAPK signaling is contingent on the ability of β-arrestin2 to form long-lived complexes with AT1R in endosomes and dependent on β-arrestin2's conformation, and that compartmentalization of mitogenic signal in endosomes is critical for the cell proliferative response mediated by AT1R. We evaluated the ability of WT-AT1R and mutants to undergo agonist-mediated internalization and receptor and β-arrestin trafficking into endosomes. First, WT-AT1R, A163T, T282M, and C289W were tagged with the Renilla luciferase (RlucII) donor and individually expressed with the PM-anchored rGFP-CAAX acceptor in HEK293 cells to track their kinetics of PM removal following AngII stimulation through bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), as described previously (29Namkung Y.

We previously observed that T282M displayed similar expression levels as compared with WT, whereas A163T and C289W expressed ∼40% greater and lesser than WT, respectively. The affinities of A163T for AngII was similar to that of WT (∼0.5 nm) but reduced for C289W and T282M (∼5 nm and ∼100 nm, respectively) (24Namkung Y. LeGouill C. Kumar S. Cao Y. Teixeira L.B.

Therefore, to ensure maximal activation, we stimulated cells with 1 μm AngII to reach maximum occupancy on all receptors (>90%). Following AngII stimulation, all receptors internalized with similar kinetics, although C289W showed a significantly greater extent of receptor removal from the PM as compared with WT after 60 min of agonist stimulation, whereas T282M displayed a lower level of internalized receptors (Fig. 1A, left panel). We tracked the trafficking of receptors into endosomes using RlucII-tagged receptors and the rGFP-FYVE acceptor anchored in endosomes (29Namkung Y. Le Gouill C. Lukashova V. Kobayashi H. Hogue M. Khoury E. Song M. Bouvier M. Laporte S.A. Monitoring G protein-coupled receptor and β-arrestin trafficking in live cells using enhanced bystander BRET.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27397672): 1217810.1038/ncomms12178Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). All receptors initially displayed similar kinetics of endosomal accumulation (up to 10 min), although A163T accumulated to a greater extent than WT into endosomes after 60 min of AngII stimulation, whereas T282M displayed reduced accumulation (Fig. 1B, left panel). We monitored the trafficking of β-arrestin into endosomes following AngII stimulation by expressing receptors with β-arrestin2–RlucII and rGFP-FYVE (29Namkung Y. Le Gouill C. Lukashova V. Kobayashi H. Hogue M. Khoury E. Song M. Bouvier M. Laporte S.A. Monitoring G protein-coupled receptor and β-arrestin trafficking in live cells using enhanced bystander BRET.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27397672): 1217810.1038/ncomms12178Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). β-arrestin2 accumulated in endosomes with similar kinetics and magnitude as WT for both A163T and C289W, although its trafficking was significantly impaired for T282M (representing only <30% of that of WT) (Fig. 1C, left panel). The potency of AngII-promoted receptor internalization and trafficking to endosomes for A163T was similar to WT, but reduced for T282M and C289W, consistent with the lower AngII affinities of these mutants (Fig. 1, A and B, right panels) (24Namkung Y. LeGouill C. Kumar S. Cao Y. Teixeira L.B. Lukasheva V. Giubilaro J. Simões S.C. Longpré J.M. Devost D. Hébert T.E. Piñeyro G. Leduc R. Costa-Neto C.M. Bouvier M. et al.Functional selectivity profiling of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor using pathway-wide BRET signaling sensors.Sci. Signal. 2018; 11 (30514808): eaat163110.1126/scisignal.aat1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Similarly, C289W and T282M displayed a reduced potency of AngII-promoted trafficking of β-arrestin into endosomes as compared with WT (8 and 27 nm, respectively, as compared with 1.7 nm for WT) (Fig. 1C, right panel). However, the trafficking efficacy of β-arrestin2 into endosome was greatly reduced for T282M even at saturating AngII concentrations that mediated maximal receptor internalization, suggesting intrinsic changes in the mutant's trafficking behavior with this β-arrestin. We next visualized the differential co-trafficking of WT and mutant receptors with β-arrestin in HEK293 cells using confocal microscopy with YFP-tagged receptors and β-arrestin2–mCherry. Prior to AngII stimulation (0 min), YFP-tagged receptors (green channel) were predominately expressed at the PM, whereas β-arrestin2–mCherry (red channel) was homogenously distributed in the cytosol, where neither protein co-localized. Following AngII stimulation at 37°C for 40 min, WT, A163T, and C289W strongly co-localized into endosomes with β-arrestin (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the BRET data, agonist-mediated activation of T282M led to receptors accumulating in endosomes with very little β-arrestin co-localizing in the same compartment (Fig. 2A, as depicted by the white arrows). Quantification of signal intensities across whole-field high-resolution structured illumination microscopy images (Fig. 2B) revealed strong co-localization of WT, A163T, and C289W with β-arrestin after AngII stimulation (r = 0.69850, 0.80893, and 0.75642, respectively), whereas T282M showed weak co-localization with β-arrestin (r = 0.35360). Cross-sectional analysis of fluorescence intensity through multiple endosomes also confirmed the high incidence of WT, A163T, and C289W with β-arrestin, and low co-localization for T282M (Fig. 2C). Together, these findings indicate that although T282M internalizes efficiently from the PM and traffic into endosomes to comparable levels as WT and other mutant receptors, its ability to co-traffic with β-arrestin2 into endosomes is greatly impaired. The impaired co-trafficking of T282M with β-arrestin into endosomes suggests a weakening of receptor–β-arrestin2 complexes during internalization. Therefore, we investigated the lability of these complexes at different stages of internalization: Engagement of β-arrestins to receptors at the PM and targeting of receptor–β-arrestin complexes into CCVs versus the removal of receptor–β-arrestin complexes from the PM into intracellular compartments. AT1R internalization is temperature sensitive because it requires the efficient activation of dynamin GTPase to pinch off the receptor–β-arrestin complexes in CCVs from the PM (29Namkung Y. Le Gouill C. Lukashova V. Kobayashi H. Hogue M. Khoury E. Song M. Bouvier M. Laporte S.A.

Commun. 2016; 7 (27397672): 1217810.1038/ncomms12178Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1). We measured the efficiency of AngII to promote the formation of receptor–β-arrestin complexes through BRET by expressing YFP-tagged WT and mutant receptors and β-arrestin2–RlucII and stimulated cells with AngII for 30 min at 10°C, which restricts the formation of complexes at the PM. We compared those conditions to ones where cells were stimulated at 37°C with or without the expression of dynamin K44A (DynK44A), which respectively restricts the formation of receptor–β-arrestin complexes at the PM or allows their targeting to endosomes. Either lowering the temperature below physiological conditions or preventing the scission of CCVs with DynK44A greatly impaired AT1R internalization from the PM (Fig. S1) (29Namkung Y. Le Gouill C. Lukashova V. Kobayashi H. Hogue M. Khoury E. Song M. Bouvier M. Laporte S.A. Monitoring G protein-coupled receptor and β-arrestin trafficking in live cells using enhanced bystander BRET.Nat.

Inhibiting endocytosis either by lowering the temperature of cells or by expressing DynK44A conserved the same rank order of potency for AngII-mediated receptor–β-arrestin2 complex formation between receptors as compared with that of AngII's action at 37°C (compare Fig. 3A, left and right panels to middle panel). Efficacy for AngII-mediated receptor–β-arrestin complex formation was similar between WT and receptor mutants when complexes were restricted to the PM, although we observed an increase in maximal complex formation for A163T, consistent with the higher expr"

Prokaryotes generally encode a large number of RNA regulators, yet their identification and characterisation is still in its infancy for most bacterial species. Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic pathogen with high innate antimicrobial resistance, which can cause the often fatal cepacia syndrome in individuals with cystic fibrosis. In this study we characterise a small RNA which is involved in the response to iron starvation, a condition that pathogenic bacteria are likely to encounter in the host. BrrF is a small RNA highly upregulated in Burkholderia cenocepacia under conditions of iron depletion and with a genome context consistent with Fur regulation. Its computationally predicted targets include iron-containing enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle such as aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase, as well as iron-containing enzymes responsible for the oxidative stress response, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase. Phenotypic and gene expression analysis of BrrF deletion and overexpression mutants show that the regulation of these genes is BrrF-dependent. Expression of acnA, fumA, sdhA and sdhC was downregulated during iron depletion in the wild type strain, but not in a BrrF deletion mutant. TCA cycle genes not predicted as target for BrrF were not affected in the same manner by iron depletion. Likewise, expression of sodB and katB was dowregulated during iron depletion in the wild type strain, but not in a BrrF deletion mutant. BrrF overexpression reduced aconitase and superoxide dismutase activities and increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. All phenotypes and gene expression changes of the BrrF deletion mutant could be complemented by overexpressing BrrF in trans. Overall, BrrF acts as a regulator of central metabolism and oxidative stress response, possibly as an iron-sparing measure to maintain iron homeostasis under conditions of iron starvation."
https://openalex.org/W3045127608,"Background Gefitinib is an orally potent and selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase and is commonly used to treat locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with sensitive EGFR mutations. Multiple adverse effects associated with gefitinib, including liver and lung injuries, severe nausea, and diarrhea, have limited its clinical application. Xenobiotic-induced bioactivation is thought to be an important reason for gefitinib toxicity, which encouraged us to clarify the metabolism of gefitinib in NSCLC patients. Materials and methods An ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLCQ-TOF-MS) method was established to tentatively identify the metabolites of gefitinib in human plasma. The extracted ion chromatogram peak intensity threshold was set at 1500 cps with minimum MS and MS/MS peak intensities of 400 and 100 cps, respectively. Results A total of 18 tentative metabolites were identified. Eight novel tentative metabolites with metabolic changes in dechlorination, defluorination, and hydrogenation on the quinazoline skeleton; removal of a partial or complete 3-chloro-4-fluoroaniline-substituted group; and sulfate conjugation and taurine conjugation were newly discovered in human plasma. Based on structural analysis of the tentative metabolites, the metabolic pathways were proposed. In addition, the pathways of dechlorination, defluorination, and hydrogenation on the quinazoline skeleton; removal of partial or complete 3-chloro-4-fluoroaniline-substituted groups; and sulfate conjugation and taurine conjugation in humans in vivo indicate that novel metabolic pathways exist in humans. Conclusions In summary, the metabolism of gefitinib in humans in vivo is extensive and complex. Based on in vivo evidence, the propoxy-morpholine ring side chain and O-methyl group are the critical metabolic regions of gefitinib in humans. The novel metabolic pathways differ from those of in vitro studies, suggesting that intestinal floral metabolism might be involved."

Using routine National TB Program data, we analyzed trends in TB notifications in five intervention districts and seven control districts in Manica province the year before this project and during a one-year intervention period.In the four quarters before the study, the intervention districts notified 5,219 individuals with all forms of TB, and the control districts notified 2,248 TB cases. During the study 5,982 all forms of people with TB were notified in the intervention area, an increase of 763 (14.6%) over the baseline, whereas the control districts notified 1,877 persons with TB, a decrease of -371 (-16.5%). The CHW screening activities yielded 1,502 notified and treated individuals with TB.Employing CHWs to promote facility-based TB screening and household contact tracing may lead to an overall increase in TB notification."

In this matched case-control study, we analysed maternal serum samples in early pregnancy for three different organochlorine compounds, to investigate whether the levels were associated with the risk of cryptorchidism.Maternal serum samples taken during the first trimester of pregnancy from 165 cases (boys born with cryptorchidism) and 165 controls, matched for birth year and maternal age, parity and smoking habits during the pregnancy, were retrieved from the Southern Sweden Maternity Biobank.

https://openalex.org/W3043838370,"Background Longitudinal left ventricular (LV) contraction can be impaired in the presence of a normal LV ejection fraction (LVEF), and abnormalities have been reported in global longitudinal strain (GLS), long-axis systolic excursion (SExc), and the peak systolic velocity (s`) of mitral annular motion using tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). However, the relationships of GLS with s` and SExc have not been systematically evaluated in subjects with a normal LVEF, and whether these relationships might be affected by variations in LV end-diastolic length (LVEDL) and heart rate is unknown. Methods We investigated the univariate and multivariate correlations of GLS with TDI measurements of s` and SExc (both using averages of the septal and lateral walls), LVEDL and heart rate in subjects with a normal LVEF (>50%) but a low peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity (septal e`≤ 7.0 cm/s and lateral e`≤ 9 cm/s), and thus an increased risk of a future cardiac event. Results 84 subjects (age 66±8 years, 29 males) with a LVEF of 62±6% and GLS of -17.5±2.3% were studied. On univariate analysis the absolute value of GLS was positively correlated with s`(r = 0.28, p<0.01) and SExc (r = 0.50, p<0.001) and inversely correlated with heart rate (r = -0.36, p = 0.001), but was not correlated with LVEDL (r = -0.15). In multivariate models, SExc explained more of the variance in GLS than s`, and absolute GLS was not only positively correlated with SExc, but also inversely correlated with LVEDL. Heart rate was an independent inverse correlate of GLS in conjunction with LVEDL and either s` or SExc, but made a larger contribution in models which included s`. Interobserver correlations were close for s` and SExc (r = 0.89–0.93), but only moderate for GLS (r = 0.71). Conclusion In subjects with a normal LVEF but reduced e`, the absolute value of GLS is more closely related to SExc than s`, and is also independently and inversely related to LVEDL and heart rate. Measurement of SExc may provide a useful additional or alternative technique to GLS for the assessment of LV long-axis function."
https://openalex.org/W3045280144,"Deep sequencing of T-cell receptor (TCR) genes is powerful at profiling immune repertoire. To prepare a TCR sequencing library, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) is widely applied and is highly efficient. That is, most mPCR products contain the region critical for antigen recognition, which also indicates regular V(D)J recombination. Multiplex PCR, however, may suffer from primer bias. A promising alternative is 5’-RACE, which avoids primer bias by applying only one primer pair. In 5’-RACE data, however, non-regular V(D)J recombination (e.g., TCR sequences without a V gene segment) has been observed and the frequency varies (30–80%) between studies. This suggests that the cause of or how to reduce non-regular TCR sequences is not yet well known by the science community. Although it is possible to speculate the cause by comparing the 5’-RACE protocols, careful experimental confirmation is needed and such a systematic study is still not available. Here, we examined the 5’-RACE protocol of a commercial kit and demonstrated how a modification increased the fraction of regular TCR-β sequences to >85%. We also found a strong linear correlation between the fraction of short DNA fragments and the percentage of non-regular TCR-β sequences, indicating that the presence of short DNA fragments in the library was the main cause of non-regular TCR-β sequences. Therefore, thorough removal of short DNA fragments from a 5’-RACE library is the key to high data efficiency. We highly recommend conducting a fragment length analysis before sequencing, and the fraction of short DNA fragments can be used to estimate the percentage of non-regular TCR sequences. As deep sequencing of TCR genes is still relatively expensive, good quality control should be valuable."

An inhibition of eIF6 release (or premature release) from the 60S subunits can greatly influence intersubunit association and translation initiation. A block in eIF6 release leads to an increase in the fraction of eIF6-bound 60S subunits that are unable to join 40S, which hinders the assembly of active 80S monosomes (10Gartmann M. Blau M.

Alternatively, insufficient levels of eIF6 seem to lead to spurious association of 60S with the 40S subunits that are devoid of mRNA. This causes an increase in the assembly of inactive 80S monosomes, which impairs translational response to growth stimuli as seen in eIF6+/− mice (17Gandin V. Miluzio A. Barbieri A.M. Beugnet A.

It is also unclear whether these uncharacterized phosphorylation sites carry any functional relevance.

Based on sequence-motif prediction analysis, we identified the presence of a GSK3-specific motif within the C-terminal tail of eIF6.

https://openalex.org/W3044257489,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is proposed to be induced by abnormal aggregation of amyloidβ in the brain. Here, we designed a brain-permeable peptide nanofiber drug from a fragment of heat shock protein to suppress aggregation of the pathogenic proteins. To facilitate delivery of the nanofiber into the brain, a protein transduction domain from Drosophila Antennapedia was incorporated into the peptide sequence. The resulting nanofiber efficiently suppressed the cytotoxicity of amyloid βby trapping amyloid β onto its hydrophobic nanofiber surface. Moreover, the intravenously or intranasally injected nanofiber was delivered into the mouse brain, and improved the cognitive function of an Alzheimer transgenic mouse model. These results demonstrate the potential therapeutic utility of nanofibers for the treatment of AD."
https://openalex.org/W3044356150,"Pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (proANP) and pro-adrenomedullin (proADM) levels increase in acute heart failure and sepsis. After cardiac surgery, children may require increased support in the intensive care unit and may develop complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of proANP and proADM values, determined prior to cardiac surgery, for predicting the need for increased respiratory or inotropic support during the post-operative period.This was a prospective study in children. Biomarkers were analyzed before surgery using a single blood test. The primary endpoints were the need for greater respiratory and/or inotropic support during the post-operative period. Secondary endpoints were the relationship between these biomarkers and complications after surgery.One hundred thirteen patients were included. ProANP and proADM were higher in children who required greater respiratory and inotropic support, especially proANP; for increased respiratory support, 578.9 vs. 106.6 pmol/L (p = 0.004), and for increased inotropic support, 1938 vs. 110.4 pmol/L (p = 0.002). ProANP had a greater AUC than proADM for predicting increased respiratory support after surgery: 0.791 vs. 0.724. A possible cut-off point for proANP could be ≥ 325 pmol/L (sensitivity = 66.7% and specificity = 88.8%). In the multivariate analysis, the logarithmic transformation of proANP was independently associated with the need for increased respiratory support (OR = 3.575). Patients who presented a poor outcome after cardiac surgery also had higher biomarker values (proADM, p = 0.013; proANP, p = 0.001).Elevated proANP before cardiac surgery may identify which children will need more respiratory and inotropic support during the post-operative period."
https://openalex.org/W3045160428,"The role of type II alveolar epithelial stem cells (AEC II) for alveolar repair in radiation-induced lung fibrosis (RILF) remains largely unknown, mainly because of AEC II phenotype's spontaneous change in vitro. Cell differentiation status is determined by Lin28 and let-7 miRNAs in see-saw-pattern. Lin28, a repressor of let-7 and a stem cell marker, is activated by β-catenin. The expression of β-catenin is regulated by GSK-3β/TGF-β1 signaling. To understand the true role of AEC II in RILF, we freshly isolated primary AEC II directly from thoracically irradiated lungs. We then explored the expressions of cell phenotype markers and differentiation regulators in these isolated AEC II to analyze the correlation between GSK-3β/TGF-β1/β-catenin signaling pathway, lin28/let-7 balance, and AEC II phenotypes at different injury phases following irradiation. Results showed that isolated single primary cells displayed AEC II ultrastructural features and proSP-C positive. The gene expressions of prosp-c (an AEC II biomarker) and hopx (an AEC I marker) significantly increased in isolated AEC II during injury repair phase (P < .001 and P < .05) but decreased at end-stage of injury, while mesenchymal markers increased in both isolated AEC II and irradiated lungs. mRNA levels of gsk-3β, tgf-β1, and β-catenin increased in all irradiated AEC II, but more pronounced in the second half of injury phase (P < .05-P < .001). Similarly, the expression of lin28 was also significantly elevated in isolated AEC II at the late phase (P < .05-P < .001). Four let-7 miRNAs were significantly upregulated in all irradiated AEC II groups (P < .05-P < .001). The time-dependent and highly consistent uptrends for four lin28/let-7 ratios in sorted AEC II contrasted to downtrends in irradiated lungs. In conclusion, RILF occurred when GSK-3β/TGF-β1 signaling increased β-catenin levels, which led to the augmentation of AEC II population by elevated lin28/let-7 ratio and the transcription of profibrotic cytokines and factors, thereby inducing AEC II to undergo transdifferentiation into mesenchymal cells."
https://openalex.org/W3045188272,"Many parts of Asia, including Taiwan, have suffered severely from freshwater fish invasions. However, few studies using an assemblage approach have been conducted in the region so far that would help to prioritize suitable preventive actions. In this study, we focused on the invasion process from the import stage to the establishment stage, and defined establishment success as the success during this predefined process. We used datasets of freshwater fish assemblages in Taiwan to (1) compare established versus non-established alien species to distinguish the determinants of establishment success, and (2) to use these determinants to test a life history hypothesis which predicts that the magnitudes of the determinants should be significantly different between established alien species and native species. We collated a dataset for freshwater fish species which were imported into Taiwan (n = 118) of which some successfully established (n = 26), and another dataset for freshwater fish species native to Taiwan (n = 77). For each imported species, we collected data for 17 variables, including two phylogenetic, two human-use, two invasion history, and 11 life history variables. We then used decision tree methods, which have advantages in analyzing datasets with many variables of mixed types without the need to make assumptions about data distributions and input data for missing values. Our results showed that aquaculture use and maximum body length were the most important determinants for predicting establishment success of alien freshwater fish in Taiwan. Comparing five important determinants between established alien versus native species showed that the established alien species were significantly more often used in aquaculture, were associated with a higher number of established countries, and had a larger body length and greater highest water temperature tolerance than the native species. We thus conclude that our results provided evidence to support our stated hypothesis. We suggest that aquaculture use, measures of body size, and the number of previously invaded countries may alert researchers and conservation managers to species with a high establishment potential, especially for countries with similar conditions as those in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W3044276017,"The objective of this study was to better understand how the lack of emergency child and obstetric care can be related to maternal and neonatal mortality levels.We performed spatiotemporal geospatial analyses using data from Brazilian municipalities. An emergency service accessibility index was derived using the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) for 951 hospitals. Mortality data from 2000 to 2015 was used to characterize space-time trends. The data was overlapped using a spatial clusters analysis to identify regions with lack of emergency access and high mortality trends.From 2000 to 2015 Brazil the overall neonatal mortality rate varied from 11,42 to 11,71 by 1000 live births. The maternal mortality presented a slightly decrease from 2,98 to 2,88 by 100 thousand inhabitants. For neonatal mortality the Northeast and North regions presented the highest percentage of up trending. For maternal mortality the North region exhibited the higher volume of up trending. The accessibility index obtained highlighted large portions of the rural areas of the country without any coverage of obstetric or neonatal beds.The analyses highlighted regions with problems of mortality and access to maternal and newborn emergency services. This sequence of steps can be applied to other low and medium income countries as health situation analysis tool.Low and middle income countries have greater disparities in access to emergency child and obstetric care. There is a lack of approaches capable to support analysis considering a spatiotemporal perspective for emergency care. Studies using Geographic Information System analysis for maternal and child care, are increasing in frequency. This approach can identify emergency child and obstetric care saturated or deprived regions. The sequence of steps designed here can help researchers, and policy makers to better design strategies aiming to improve emergency child and obstetric care."
https://openalex.org/W3044948246,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have routinely detected human quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for complex traits. Viewing that most GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are found in non-coding regions unrelated to the physiology of a polygenic trait of interest, a vital question to answer is whether or not any of these SNPs can functionally alter the phenotype with which it is associated. The study of blood pressure (BP) is a case in point. Conserved mechanisms in controlling BP by modularity is now unifying differing mammalian orders in that understanding mechanisms in rodents is tantamount to revealing the same in humans, while overcoming experimental limitations imposed by human studies. As a proof of principle, we used BP QTLs from Dahl salt-sensitive rats (DSS) as substitutes to capture distinct human functional orthologs. 3 DSS BP QTLs are located into distinct genome regions and correspond to several human GWAS genes. Each of the QTLs independently exerted a major impact on BP in vivo. BP was functionally changed by normotensive alleles from each of these QTLs, and yet, the human GWAS SNPs do not exist in the rat. They cannot be responsible for physiological alterations in BP caused by these QTLs. These SNPs are genome emblems for QTLs nearby, rather than being QTLs per se, since they only emerged during primate evolution after BP-regulating mechanisms have been established. We then identified specific mutated coding domains that are conserved between rodents and humans and that may implicate different steps of a common pathway or separate pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3045013656,"Three studies have tested the hypothesis that intermediate-status groups are more oriented to ally with outgroups when their social position is under threat. In study 1, participants believed that their ingroup was intermediate in status and social stratification was manipulated as either stable or status-detrimental unstable. Results indicated that participants were more likely to seek alliances a) with a high-status group and b) when social stratification was status-detrimental unstable. Study 2 showed that participants were more likely to seek alliances with a lower status group when social stratification was status-detrimental unstable rather than stable, while they were supportive of policies helping disadvantaged groups regardless of the stability of social stratification. Study 3 showed that when social stratification was status-detrimental unstable, intermediate-status group members were more oriented to ally with a low-status group, equally supportive of policies helping disadvantaged groups, but less oriented to supplying direct help to a low-status group."
https://openalex.org/W3045237750,"Beth Cindy Levine, founder of the field of modern mammalian autophagy, died on 15 June at the age of 60. Beth seamlessly integrated the molecular and cellular mechanisms of autophagy—in which cellular cargo is captured and degraded, “cleaning” the cell—into new understandings of disease pathogenesis, often challenging dogma and winning.

Born on 7 April 1960 in Newark, New Jersey, Beth graduated from Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1981 with a degree in French studies and obtained an M.D. from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City 5 years later. She completed training in internal medicine and infectious diseases before accepting her first faculty position at Columbia University in New York City in 1992. In 2004, she left Columbia to become chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, a position she held until 2011, when she became the director of the university's Center for Autophagy Research. Beth was selected as a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator in 2007, and she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2013. The following year, she received the American Society for Clinical Investigation's Stanley J. Korsmeyer Award for her work in autophagy.

Early in her independent career, Beth performed a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) experiment that, unexpectedly, showed that the apoptosis-blocking protein Bcl-2 bound a previously unknown protein, which she named Beclin 1. In pivotal papers in 1998 and 1999, Beth identified Beclin 1 and proved that it is an autophagy protein that functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer cells, a finding later confirmed in animal studies. Beth was fond of showing the original plates from this Y2H experiment as the introduction for her many talks at scientific meetings.

Beth had a knack for combining diverse disciplines, molecular mechanisms, and experimental approaches to forge new concepts of biology. By studying Beclin 1, she made fundamental discoveries linking autophagy to the pathogenesis of cancer, developmental disorders such as Fanconi anemia, and neurodegenerative and infectious diseases, and the physiologic processes of development and aging. She linked exercise to autophagy, and thus to metabolic regulation, and showed that innate immune Toll receptors, surprisingly, connect Beclin 1 to metabolic signaling, muscle function, and disease. Beth created an autophagy-inducing peptide that she and others have used to probe the physiologic effects of autophagy induction in vivo.

This subset of her accomplishments exemplifies the consistency with which Beth and her group, often in collaboration with colleagues from varied fields and backgrounds, coupled previously unconnected concepts to create new paradigms. Her work spanned structural biology, cell biology, virology, and animal physiology, a difficult challenge that Beth regularly met with rigor and exceptional experimental insight.



Beth imbued the field of autophagy with a sense of community, a feeling of purpose, and a moral commitment to nurturing young scientists. She was proud to be the founder, in 2003, of the ongoing Gordon Research Conference on Autophagy in Stress, Development, and Disease, bringing together a scientifically eclectic and international community of scholars. Many of the first meeting's participants, including two of us (H.W.V. and A.M.C.), remain friends to this day. Beth's meetings featured wide-ranging talks on yeast, worms, flies, mice, structural biology, and human biology. She had a clear vision of the field's potential, and she set the tone of integrity and collegiality that has characterized our meetings ever since. We will miss her polished-to-perfection talks, her fearless defense of the data, her insightful remarks, and her intelligent questions, as well as her laugh at the dinner table, her fine sense of humor, her look of complicity when somebody pulled a prank, and her free spirit on the dance floor.

We all benefited from Beth's exceptional mentoring skills, which ushered generations of bright young scientists into the field. Many of the women in the autophagy community are indebted to Beth for her support. She told things as she saw them and did not indulge in self-pity when that precious time could instead be dedicated to resolving scientific problems for the benefit of humanity. Beth would always stop to listen to those in need of scientific advice, career guidance, or just a patient, friendly ear.

Beth's vibrant approach to work and to life was immediately apparent to anyone who spent time with her. Her visionary creativity, innate curiosity, rigor in thought, and unparalleled commitment and dedication to science and medicine made it impossible not to gravitate toward her, to bear witness to science at its best; she was a leader whom people liked to follow.

Beth made courageous sacrifices for the benefit of science and those in the field of autophagy, in later years attending autophagy meetings with her portable oxygen tank in tow while somehow retaining her natural elegance. During her final weeks, she was actively participating in advisory panels, planning for the continuation of her work and the future of her trainees, holding lab meetings, and even submitting a major manuscript the day before she left us. She planned for her own death with the dedication and care she brought to all aspects of her life.

Beth's love for science was matched only by her profound love for her family. Listening to her proudly bragging about her children's talents, creativity, and passion was always uplifting. As in everything else, Beth excelled in balancing career and family.

Given her dedication as a true physician scientist committed to alleviating human suffering and maximizing human potential, we believe that the best way to honor Beth is by continuing the work that she so obviously loved. Someday, human diseases will be remediated on the basis of her discoveries. If she were to witness such success, she would be exceptionally proud and then ask, “So what is the next step forward?”"

https://openalex.org/W3044820337,"I never imagined my graduate school experience would be so heavily impacted by a personal crisis. Yet, during the second year of my Ph.D. program, the COVID-19 pandemic marked the beginning of the most difficult chapter of my life. My university shut down, I moved out of my roommate-filled house to protect my immunocompromised partner, and I lost my older brother to suicide. As the dust started to settle, I went through an unexpected breakup: My partner was going to Alaska, where I had planned to join him for the summer, and he ended our relationship days before his departure. Within a span of 2 months, my life had become nearly unrecognizable.



> “For me, goal setting and task completion are forms of self-care.” 

I was overwhelmed by heartbreak and the feeling that my world had fallen apart. My sense of time all but disappeared, and my mind went into overdrive to process the rapid succession of losses. To make matters worse, I didn't even have the comfort of friends from closer than 6 feet.

My adviser told me to take the personal time I needed, and other graduate students took over my teaching responsibilities for the rest of the semester. I visited my family in the immediate aftermath of my brother's death. I also met regularly with my therapist and, in the weeks that followed, I gave myself time to process my grief in other ways, such as by regularly calling friends and family and going on long runs and bike rides.

Well-meaning friends and family suggested I take a leave of absence from my Ph.D. program. But I didn't think that was a good idea. I feared that too much unstructured time would cause me to dwell on past events outside of my control, which would not be good for my mental health. On a more practical level, I needed my graduate stipend, and the last thing I wanted was to add financial instability to my worries.

So I stuck with my program, taking each day as it came. At first, I attempted to work on my dissertation. But preparing for qualifying exams and planning an international field season that—given the pandemic—might not even happen felt overwhelming. Through a process of trial and error, I found small projects, unrelated to my research, that consumed me and gave me a sense of moving forward without driving me to burnout. I sat down and wrote science communication pieces that I had been meaning to tackle for the past 2 years. I reached out to old connections and potential collaborators to strengthen my professional network. And I took an online course that taught me how to learn more effectively.

Some may argue that if I could work on side projects, then I could also work on my dissertation. Logically, I can't disagree. But grieving and healing are not logical processes so much as intuitive ones.

Each time I thought about diving back into my research, it filled me with panic—not how I want to feel about the work I love so much. So, I gave myself permission to wait and try again in a few days. In the meantime, my small projects reassured me that I was capable of setting and achieving goals. They also helped me see my own creativity and resilience in a time of crisis—skills that I had worked hard to develop during my first year of grad school, when I struggled with depression.

Nearly 4 months have passed since my brother's death, and I still break down at certain reminders of him. Yet, with the help of an incredible support network, I am moving through the grief of his passing and my other losses. Slowly but surely, I'm also developing the mental space to work on my core grad school tasks. I'm now spending the bulk of my workdays studying for my qualifying exams, which I'm slated to take in September.

In the midst of a crisis, it can be difficult to disentangle what you think you need from what you actually need. “Do what you need to take care of yourself” is a nice sentiment, but it didn't help me. I needed a program. My crisis taught me that I benefit from daily doses of healthy distractions—and that, for me, goal setting and task completion are forms of self-care. Yet I'm grateful I had a chance to find my own way forward without the pressure of a predetermined timeline. I hope other students dealing with crises can be given the same freedom."
