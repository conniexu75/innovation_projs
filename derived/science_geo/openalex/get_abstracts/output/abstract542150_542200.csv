https://openalex.org/W2104549677,"The 1000 Genomes Project set out to provide a comprehensive description of common human genetic variation by applying whole-genome sequencing to a diverse set of individuals from multiple populations. Here we report completion of the project, having reconstructed the genomes of 2,504 individuals from 26 populations using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, deep exome sequencing, and dense microarray genotyping. We characterized a broad spectrum of genetic variation, in total over 88 million variants (84.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 3.6 million short insertions/deletions (indels), and 60,000 structural variants), all phased onto high-quality haplotypes. This resource includes >99% of SNP variants with a frequency of >1% for a variety of ancestries. We describe the distribution of genetic variation across the global sample, and discuss the implications for common disease studies."
https://openalex.org/W1912672559,"Structural variants are implicated in numerous diseases and make up the majority of varying nucleotides among human genomes. Here we describe an integrated set of eight structural variant classes comprising both balanced and unbalanced variants, which we constructed using short-read DNA sequencing data and statistically phased onto haplotype blocks in 26 human populations. Analysing this set, we identify numerous gene-intersecting structural variants exhibiting population stratification and describe naturally occurring homozygous gene knockouts that suggest the dispensability of a variety of human genes. We demonstrate that structural variants are enriched on haplotypes identified by genome-wide association studies and exhibit enrichment for expression quantitative trait loci. Additionally, we uncover appreciable levels of structural variant complexity at different scales, including genic loci subject to clusters of repeated rearrangement and complex structural variants with multiple breakpoints likely to have formed through individual mutational events. Our catalogue will enhance future studies into structural variant demography, functional impact and disease association. The Structural Variation Analysis Group of The 1000 Genomes Project reports an integrated structural variation map based on discovery and genotyping of eight major structural variation classes in 2,504 unrelated individuals from across 26 populations; structural variation is compared within and between populations and its functional impact is quantified.

https://openalex.org/W2165294844,"Quantum computation requires qubits that can be coupled in a scalable manner, together with universal and high-fidelity one- and two-qubit logic gates. Many physical realizations of qubits exist, including single photons, trapped ions, superconducting circuits, single defects or atoms in diamond and silicon, and semiconductor quantum dots, with single-qubit fidelities that exceed the stringent thresholds required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Despite this, high-fidelity two-qubit gates in the solid state that can be manufactured using standard lithographic techniques have so far been limited to superconducting qubits, owing to the difficulties of coupling qubits and dephasing in semiconductor systems. Here we present a two-qubit logic gate, which uses single spins in isotopically enriched silicon and is realized by performing single- and two-qubit operations in a quantum dot system using the exchange interaction, as envisaged in the Loss-DiVincenzo proposal. We realize CNOT gates via controlled-phase operations combined with single-qubit operations. Direct gate-voltage control provides single-qubit addressability, together with a switchable exchange interaction that is used in the two-qubit controlled-phase gate. By independently reading out both qubits, we measure clear anticorrelations in the two-spin probabilities of the CNOT gate."
https://openalex.org/W1829380695,"Top-down prefrontal cortex inputs to the hippocampus have been hypothesized to be important in memory consolidation, retrieval, and the pathophysiology of major psychiatric diseases; however, no such direct projections have been identified and functionally described. Here we report the discovery of a monosynaptic prefrontal cortex (predominantly anterior cingulate) to hippocampus (CA3 to CA1 region) projection in mice, and find that optogenetic manipulation of this projection (here termed AC–CA) is capable of eliciting contextual memory retrieval. To explore the network mechanisms of this process, we developed and applied tools to observe cellular-resolution neural activity in the hippocampus while stimulating AC–CA projections during memory retrieval in mice behaving in virtual-reality environments. Using this approach, we found that learning drives the emergence of a sparse class of neurons in CA2/CA3 that are highly correlated with the local network and that lead synchronous population activity events; these neurons are then preferentially recruited by the AC–CA projection during memory retrieval. These findings reveal a sparsely implemented memory retrieval mechanism in the hippocampus that operates via direct top-down prefrontal input, with implications for the patterning and storage of salient memory representations. Here, a sparse neuronal projection from a part of the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, to the hippocampus is identified that, when activated, can elicit memory retrieval in mice. Recent work has begun to explore how neural ensembles in the hippocampus encode and reactivate a memory, but relatively little is known about how hypothesized 'top-down' inputs arising in the cortex could potentially influence memory processes. Here Karl Deisseroth and colleagues develop new tools and strategies to identify a sparse neuronal projection from the anterior cingulate (part of the prefrontal cortex) to the hippocampus. When activated, these projections can elicit memory retrieval in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1754557093,"It is generally thought that the quiescence of tissue is not actively maintained, but rather a state reflecting the absence of proliferative signal; here the authors find that quiescence is actively maintained by paracrine hedgehog signalling provided by the epithelium in the mouse adult lung, and that hedgehog is dynamically regulated during injury repair and resolution for proper restoration of tissue homeostasis after injury. This study questions the common assumption that the quiescence of tissue is not maintained actively, but is a state reflecting the absence of proliferative signal. Edward Morrisey and colleagues report that quiescence in mesenchymal tissue in the mouse adult lung is actively maintained by paracrine sonic hedgehog signalling provided by the adjacent epithelium. They show that this signal needs to be downregulated after injury to allow proliferation of the lung mesenchyme, which is key for tissue repair. Postnatal tissue quiescence is thought to be a default state in the absence of a proliferative stimulus such as injury. Although previous studies have demonstrated that certain embryonic developmental programs are reactivated aberrantly in adult organs to drive repair and regeneration1,2,3, it is not well understood how quiescence is maintained in organs such as the lung, which displays a remarkably low level of cellular turnover4,5. Here we demonstrate that quiescence in the adult lung is an actively maintained state and is regulated by hedgehog signalling. Epithelial-specific deletion of sonic hedgehog (Shh) during postnatal homeostasis in the murine lung results in a proliferative expansion of the adjacent lung mesenchyme. Hedgehog signalling is initially downregulated during the acute phase of epithelial injury as the mesenchyme proliferates in response, but returns to baseline during injury resolution as quiescence is restored. Activation of hedgehog during acute epithelial injury attenuates the proliferative expansion of the lung mesenchyme, whereas inactivation of hedgehog signalling prevents the restoration of quiescence during injury resolution. Finally, we show that hedgehog also regulates epithelial quiescence and regeneration in response to injury via a mesenchymal feedback mechanism. These results demonstrate that epithelial–mesenchymal interactions coordinated by hedgehog actively maintain postnatal tissue homeostasis, and deregulation of hedgehog during injury leads to aberrant repair and regeneration in the lung."

https://openalex.org/W1959369787,"As a basic functional unit in neural circuits, each neuron integrates input signals from hundreds to thousands of synapses. Knowledge of the synaptic input fields of individual neurons, including the identity, strength, and location of each synapse, is essential for understanding how neurons compute. Here, we developed a volumetric super-resolution reconstruction platform for large-volume imaging and automated segmentation of neurons and synapses with molecular identity information. We used this platform to map inhibitory synaptic input fields of On-Off direction-selective ganglion cells (On-Off DSGCs), which are important for computing visual motion direction in the mouse retina. The reconstructions of On-Off DSGCs showed a GABAergic, receptor subtype-specific input field for generating direction selective responses without significant glycinergic inputs for mediating monosynaptic crossover inhibition. These results demonstrate unique capabilities of this super-resolution platform for interrogating neural circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2165394975,"Na(+)-activated K(+) channels are members of the Slo family of large conductance K(+) channels that are widely expressed in the brain, where their opening regulates neuronal excitability. These channels fulfil a number of biological roles and have intriguing biophysical properties, including conductance levels that are ten times those of most other K(+) channels and gating sensitivity to intracellular Na(+). Here we present the structure of a complete Na(+)-activated K(+) channel, chicken Slo2.2, in the Na(+)-free state, determined by cryo-electron microscopy at a nominal resolution of 4.5 ångströms. The channel is composed of a large cytoplasmic gating ring, in which resides the Na(+)-binding site and a transmembrane domain that closely resembles voltage-gated K(+) channels. In the structure, the cytoplasmic domain adopts a closed conformation and the ion conduction pore is also closed. The structure reveals features that can explain the unusually high conductance of Slo channels and how contraction of the cytoplasmic gating ring closes the pore."
https://openalex.org/W2138549950,"Epithelial cells are normally stably anchored, maintaining their relative positions and association with the basement membrane. Developmental rearrangements occur through cell intercalation, and cells can delaminate during epithelial-mesenchymal transitions and metastasis. We mapped the formation of lung neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs), innervated clusters of neuroendocrine/neurosensory cells within the bronchial epithelium, revealing a targeted mode of cell migration that we named ""slithering,"" in which cells transiently lose epithelial character but remain associated with the membrane while traversing neighboring epithelial cells to reach cluster sites. Immunostaining, lineage tracing, clonal analysis, and live imaging showed that NEB progenitors, initially distributed randomly, downregulate adhesion and polarity proteins, crawling over and between neighboring cells to converge at diametrically opposed positions at bronchial branchpoints, where they reestablish epithelial structure and express neuroendocrine genes. There is little accompanying progenitor proliferation or apoptosis. Activation of the slithering program may explain why lung cancers arising from neuroendocrine cells are highly metastatic."
https://openalex.org/W2225840389,"Mitochondrial fission and proteins vital to this process play essential roles in apoptosis. Several mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, including mitochondrial fission protein 1 (Fis1), mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) and mitochondrial dynamics of 51 kDa protein (MiD51), also known as mitochondrial elongation factor 1 (MEIF1), have been reported to promote mitochondrial fission by recruiting the GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). However, it remains unclear how these fission factors coordinate to control apoptotic mitochondrial fission. Molecular studies have suggested the existence of interaction between Mff and Drp1, but fundamental questions remain concerning their function. In the present study, we reported that the phosphorylation status of Drp1-Ser(637) was essential for its interaction with Mff. UV stimulation induced a decrease in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Drp1 phosphorylation on Ser(637) and enhanced the interaction between Drp1 and Mff, resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation. Simultaneously, the interaction increased markedly between Fis1 and MiD51/MIEF1, whereas the interaction between Drp1 and MiD51/MIEF1 decreased significantly after UV irradiation, which suggests that Fis1 competitively binds to MiD51/MIEF1 to activate Drp1 indirectly. Moreover, Mff-Drp1 binding and Mff-mediated recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondria did not require Bax during UV stimulation. Our study revealed a novel role of Mff in regulation of mitochondrial fission and showed how the fission proteins are orchestrated to mediate the fission process during apoptosis."

Recognizing this issue, in 2013, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund issued a request for application titled “NIH Director's Biomedical Research Workforce Innovation Award: Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training (BEST).” These 5-yr 1-time grants, awarded to 17 single or partnering institutions, were designed to develop sustainable approaches to broaden graduate and postgraduate training, aimed at creating training programs that reflect the range of career options that trainees may ultimately pursue. These institutions have formed a consortium in order to work together to develop, evaluate, share, and disseminate best practices and challenges. This is a first report on the early experiences of the consortium and the scope of participating BEST programs. In this report, we describe the state of the U.S. biomedical workforce and development of the BEST award, variations of programmatic approaches to assist with program design without BEST funding, and novel approaches to engage faculty in career development programs. To test the effectiveness of these BEST programs, external evaluators will assess their outcomes not only over the 5 yr grant period but also for an additional 10 yr beyond award completion.—Meyers, F.

Thus, the role of two essential and conserved viral nuclear egress proteins, pUL50 and pUL53, is pivotal. pUL50 and pUL53 heterodimerize and form a core nuclear egress complex (NEC), which is anchored to the inner nuclear membrane and provides a scaffold for the assembly of a multimeric viral-cellular NEC. Here, we report the crystal structure of the pUL50-pUL53 heterodimer (amino acids 1–175 and 50–292, respectively) at 2.44 Å resolution. Both proteins adopt a globular fold with mixed α and β secondary structure elements. pUL53-specific features include a zinc-binding site and a hook-like N-terminal extension, the latter representing a hallmark element of the pUL50-pUL53 interaction. The hook-like extension (amino acids 59–87) embraces pUL50 and contributes 1510 Å2 to the total interface area (1880 Å2). The pUL50 structure overall resembles the recently published NMR structure of the murine cytomegalovirus homolog pM50 but reveals a considerable repositioning of the very C-terminal α-helix of pUL50 upon pUL53 binding. pUL53 shows structural resemblance with the GHKL domain of bacterial sensory histidine kinases. A close examination of the crystal structure indicates partial assembly of pUL50-pUL53 heterodimers to hexameric ring-like structures possibly providing additional scaffolding opportunities for NEC. In combination, the structural information on pUL50-pUL53 considerably improves our understanding of the mechanism of HCMV nuclear egress. It may also accelerate the validation of the NEC as a unique target for developing a novel type of antiviral drug and improved options of broad-spectrum antiherpesviral therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2267382913,"Iron is an essential metal element for all living organisms. Graminaceous plants produce and secrete mugineic acid family phytosiderophores from their roots to acquire iron in the soil. Phytosiderophores chelate and solubilize insoluble iron hydroxide in the soil. Subsequently, plants take up iron-phytosiderophore complexes through specific transporters on the root cell membrane. Phytosiderophores are also thought to be important for the internal transport of various transition metals, including iron. In this study, we analyzed TOM2 and TOM3, rice homologs of transporter of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores 1 (TOM1), a crucial efflux transporter directly involved in phytosiderophore secretion into the soil. Transgenic rice analysis using promoter-β-glucuronidase revealed that TOM2 was expressed in tissues involved in metal translocation, whereas TOM3 was expressed only in restricted parts of the plant. Strong TOM2 expression was observed in developing tissues during seed maturation and germination, whereas TOM3 expression was weak during seed maturation. Transgenic rice in which TOM2 expression was repressed by RNA interference showed growth defects compared with non-transformants and TOM3-repressed rice. Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing TOM2 released 14C-labeled deoxymugineic acid, the initial phytosiderophore compound in the biosynthetic pathway in rice. In onion epidermal and rice root cells, the TOM2-GFP fusion protein localized to the cell membrane, indicating that the TOM2 protein is a transporter for phytosiderophore efflux to the cell exterior.

https://openalex.org/W2228198088,"The mammalian Hippo signaling pathway regulates cell growth and survival and is frequently dysregulated in cancer. YAP and TAZ are transcriptional coactivators that function as effectors of this signaling pathway. Aberrant YAP and TAZ activity is reported in several human cancers, and normally the expression and nuclear localization of these proteins is tightly regulated. We sought to establish whether a direct relationship exists between YAP and TAZ. Using knockdown and overexpression experiments we show YAP inversely regulates the abundance of TAZ protein by proteasomal degradation. Interestingly this phenomenon was uni-directional since TAZ expression did not affect YAP abundance. Structure/function analyses suggest that YAP-induced TAZ degradation is a consequence of YAP-targeted gene transcription involving TEAD factors. Subsequent investigation of known regulators of TAZ degradation using specific inhibitors revealed a role for heat shock protein 90 and glycogen synthase kinase 3 but not casein kinase 1 nor LATS in YAP-mediated TAZ loss. Importantly, this phenomenon is conserved from mouse to human; however, interestingly, different YAP isoforms varied in their ability to degrade TAZ. Since shRNA-mediated TAZ depletion in HeLa and D645 cells caused apoptotic cell death, we propose that isoform-specific YAP-mediated TAZ degradation may contribute to the contradicting roles reported for YAP overexpression. This study identifies a novel mechanism of TAZ regulation by YAP, which has significant implications for our understanding of Hippo pathway regulation, YAP-isoform specific signaling, and the role of these proteins in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2305987037,"Current chemotherapeutic agents based on apoptosis induction are lacking in desired efficacy. Therefore, there is continuous effort to bring about new dimension in control and gradual eradication of cancer by means of ever evolving therapeutic strategies. Various forms of PCD are being increasingly implicated in anti-cancer therapy and the complex interplay among them is vital for the ultimate fate of proliferating cells. We elaborated and illustrated the underlying mechanism of the most potent Andrographolide analogue (AG-4) mediated action that involved the induction of dual modes of cell death-apoptosis and autophagy in human leukemic U937 cells.AG-4 induced cytotoxicity was associated with redox imbalance and apoptosis which involved mitochondrial depolarisation, altered apoptotic protein expressions, activation of the caspase cascade leading to cell cycle arrest. Incubation with caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk or Bax siRNA decreased cytotoxic efficacy of AG-4 emphasising critical roles of caspase and Bax. In addition, AG-4 induced autophagy as evident from LC3-II accumulation, increased Atg protein expressions and autophagosome formation. Pre-treatment with 3-MA or Atg 5 siRNA suppressed the cytotoxic effect of AG-4 implying the pro-death role of autophagy. Furthermore, incubation with Z-VAD-fmk or Bax siRNA subdued AG-4 induced autophagy and pre-treatment with 3-MA or Atg 5 siRNA curbed AG-4 induced apoptosis-implying that apoptosis and autophagy acted as partners in the context of AG-4 mediated action. AG-4 also inhibited PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Inhibition of mTOR or Akt augmented AG-4 induced apoptosis and autophagy signifying its crucial role in its mechanism of action.Thus, these findings prove the dual ability of AG-4 to induce apoptosis and autophagy which provide a new perspective to it as a potential molecule targeting PCD for future cancer therapeutics."

PLOD2 expression and subsequent pyridinoline cross-links are increased in fibrotic pathologies by transforming growth factor β-1 (TGFβ1). In this report we examined the molecular processes underlying TGFβ1-induced PLOD2 expression. We found that binding of the TGFβ1 pathway related transcription factors SMAD3 and SP1-mediated TGFβ1 enhanced PLOD2 expression and could be correlated to an increase of acetylated histone H3 and H4 at the PLOD2 promoter. Interestingly, the classical co-activators of SMAD3 complexes, p300 and CBP, were not responsible for the enhanced H3 and H4 acetylation. Depletion of SMAD3 reduced PLOD2 acetylated H3 and H4, indicating that another as of yet unidentified histone acetyltransferase binds to SMAD3 at PLOD2. Assessing histone methylation marks at the PLOD2 promoter depicted an increase of the active histone mark H3K79me2, a decrease of the repressive H4K20me3 mark, but no role for the generally strong transcription-related modifications: H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3. Collectively, our findings reveal that TGFβ1 induces a SP1- and SMAD3-dependent recruitment of histone modifying enzymes to the PLOD2 promoter other than the currently known TGFβ1 downstream co-activators and epigenetic modifications.

https://openalex.org/W1859052209,"In social interactions among mammals, individuals are recognized by olfactory cues, but identifying the key signals among thousands of compounds remains a major challenge. To address this need, we developed a new technique, component-activity matching (CAM), to select candidate ligands that ""explain"" patterns of bioactivity across diverse complex mixtures. Using mouse urine from eight different sexes and strains, we identified 23 components to explain firing rates in seven of eight functional classes of vomeronasal sensory neurons. Focusing on a class of neurons selective for females, we identified a novel family of vomeronasal ligands, steroid carboxylic acids. These ligands accounted for much of the neuronal activity of urine from some female strains, were necessary for normal levels of male investigatory behavior of female scents, and were sufficient to trigger mounting behavior. CAM represents the first step toward an exhaustive characterization of the molecular cues for natural behavior in a mammalian olfactory system."
https://openalex.org/W2204583151,"Tumour cells can use strategies that make them resistant to nutrient deprivation to outcompete their neighbours. A key integrator of the cell’s responses to starvation and other stresses is amino-acid-dependent mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Activation of mTORC1 on late endosomes and lysosomes is facilitated by amino-acid transporters within the solute-linked carrier 36 (SLC36) and SLC38 families. Here, we analyse the functions of SLC36 family member, SLC36A4, otherwise known as proton-assisted amino-acid transporter 4 (PAT4), in colorectal cancer. We show that independent of other major pathological factors, high PAT4 expression is associated with reduced relapse-free survival after colorectal cancer surgery. Consistent with this, PAT4 promotes HCT116 human colorectal cancer cell proliferation in culture and tumour growth in xenograft models. Inducible knockdown in HCT116 cells reveals that PAT4 regulates a form of mTORC1 with two distinct properties: first, it preferentially targets eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), and second, it is resistant to rapamycin treatment. Furthermore, in HCT116 cells two non-essential amino acids, glutamine and serine, which are often rapidly metabolised by tumour cells, regulate rapamycin-resistant mTORC1 in a PAT4-dependent manner. Overexpressed PAT4 is also able to promote rapamycin resistance in human embryonic kidney-293 cells. PAT4 is predominantly associated with the Golgi apparatus in a range of cell types, and in situ proximity ligation analysis shows that PAT4 interacts with both mTORC1 and its regulator Rab1A on the Golgi. These findings, together with other studies, suggest that differentially localised intracellular amino-acid transporters contribute to the activation of alternate forms of mTORC1. Furthermore, our data predict that colorectal cancer cells with high PAT4 expression will be more resistant to depletion of serine and glutamine, allowing them to survive and outgrow neighbouring normal and tumorigenic cells, and potentially providing a new route for pharmacological intervention."
https://openalex.org/W4241652217,"Abstract Close to half of de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases do not exhibit any cytogenetic aberrations. In this regard, distortion of the DNA methylation setting and the presence of mutations in epigenetic modifier genes can also be molecular drivers of the disease. In recent years, somatic missense mutations of the DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) have been reported in ~20% of AML patients; however, no obvious critical downstream gene has been identified that could explain the role of DNMT3A in the natural history of AML. Herein, using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and DNA methylation microarrays, we have identified a key gene undergoing promoter hypomethylation-associated transcriptional reactivation in DNMT3 mutant patients, the leukemogenic HOX cofactor MEIS1. Our results indicate that, in the absence of mixed lineage leukemia fusions, an alternative pathway for engaging an oncogenic MEIS1-dependent transcriptional program can be mediated by DNMT3A mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2200122349,"Deregulation of the MYC oncogene produces Myc protein that regulates multiple aspects of cancer cell metabolism, contributing to the acquisition of building blocks essential for cancer cell growth and proliferation. Therefore, disabling Myc function represents an attractive therapeutic option for cancer treatment. However, pharmacological strategies capable of directly targeting Myc remain elusive. Here, we identified that 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA), a drug candidate that primarily inhibits glycolysis, preferentially induced massive cell death in human cancer cells overexpressing the MYC oncogene, in vitro and in vivo, without appreciable effects on those exhibiting low MYC levels. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of glutamine metabolism synergistically potentiated the synthetic lethal targeting of MYC by 3-BrPA due in part to the metabolic disturbance caused by this combination. Mechanistically, we identified that the proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) and MCT2, which enable efficient 3-BrPA uptake by cancer cells, were selectively activated by Myc. Two regulatory mechanisms were involved: first, Myc directly activated MCT1 and MCT2 transcription by binding to specific recognition sites of both genes; second, Myc transcriptionally repressed miR29a and miR29c, resulting in enhanced expression of their target protein MCT1. Of note, expressions of MCT1 and MCT2 were each significantly elevated in MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas and C-MYC-overexpressing lymphomas than in tumors without MYC overexpression, correlating with poor prognosis and unfavorable patient survival. These results identify a novel mechanism by which Myc sensitizes cells to metabolic inhibitors and validate 3-BrPA as potential Myc-selective cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2231798535,"B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is essential for the development of B cells and has a critical role in B-cell neoplasia. Increasing evidence indicates an association between chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and B-cell lymphoma, however, the mechanisms by which HCV causes B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder are still unclear. Herein, we demonstrate the expression of HCV viral proteins in B cells of HCV-infected patients and show that HCV upregulates BCR signaling in human primary B cells. HCV nonstructural protein NS3/4A interacts with CHK2 and downregulates its activity, modulating HuR posttranscriptional regulation of a network of target mRNAs associated with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Interestingly, the BCR signaling pathway was found to have the largest number of transcripts with increased association with HuR and was upregulated by NS3/4A. Our study reveals a previously unidentified role of NS3/4A in regulation of host BCR signaling during HCV infection, contributing to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HCV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2273299625,"Squalene monooxygenase (SM) is an important control point in cholesterol synthesis beyond 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Although it is known to associate with the endoplasmic reticulum, its topology has not been determined. We have elucidated the membrane topology of the sterol-responsive domain of SM comprising the first 100 amino acids fused to GFP (SM N100-GFP) by determining the accessibility of 16 introduced cysteines to the cysteine-reactive, membrane-impermeable reagent PEG-maleimide. We have identified a region integrally associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane that is likely to interact with cholesterol or respond to cholesterol-induced membrane effects. By comparing cysteine accessibility with and without cholesterol treatment, we further present evidence to suggest that cholesterol induces a conformational change in SM N100-GFP. This change is likely to lead to its targeted degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system because degradation is blunted by treatment with the chemical chaperone glycerol, which retains SM N100-GFP in its native conformation. Furthermore, degradation can be disrupted by insertion of two N-terminal myc tags, implicating the N terminus in this process. Together, this information provides new molecular insights into the regulation of this critical control point in cholesterol synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2210017752,"Functions of extracellular vesicles including exosomes in the pathogenesis of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) have not yet been studied. We report that the extracellular vesicles such as exosomes derived from tuberous sclerosis 1 (Tsc1)-null cells transform phenotypes of neighboring wild-type cells in vivo in such manner that they become functionally similar to Tsc1-null cells. The loss of Tsc1 in the mouse neural tube increases the number of the wild-type neuronal progenitors, which is followed by the precocious and transient acceleration of neuronal differentiation of these cells. The mechanisms regulating these changes involve the exosomal delivery of exosomal shuttle Notch1 and Rheb esRNA and component of γ-secretase complex presenilin 1 from Tsc1-null cells to wild-type cells leading to the activation of Notch and Rheb signaling in the recipient cells. The exosome-mediated mechanisms may also operate in the cells of angiomyolipoma (AML), which develops as a result of mutations in TSC1/TSC2 genes in TSC patients, because we observed the reactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin and Notch pathways, driven by the delivery of Rheb and Notch1 esRNA, in AML cells depleted of Rheb that were treated with the exosomes purified from AML cells with the constitutively high Rheb levels."
https://openalex.org/W2157769980,"The effects of interpersonal interactions on individual’s agreements result in a social aggregation process which is reflected in the formation of collective states, as for instance, groups of individuals with a similar opinion about a given issue. This field, which has been a longstanding concern of sociologists and psychologists, has been extended into an area of experimental social psychology, and even has attracted the attention of physicists and mathematicians. In this article, we present a novel model of opinion formation in which agents may either have a strict preference for a choice, or be undecided. The opinion shift emerges, in a threshold process, as a consequence of a cumulative persuasion for either one of the two opinions in repeated interactions. There are two main ingredients which play key roles in determining the steady states: the initial fraction of undecided agents and the change in agents’ persuasion after each interaction. As a function of these two parameters, the model presents a wide range of solutions, among which there are consensus of each opinion and bi-polarization. We found that a minimum fraction of undecided agents is not crucial for reaching consensus only, but also to determine a dominant opinion in a polarized situation. In order to gain a deeper comprehension of the dynamics, we also present the theoretical framework of the model. The master equations are of special interest for their nontrivial properties and difficulties in being solved analytically."
https://openalex.org/W1906127051,"The validation of candidate biomarkers often is hampered by the lack of a reliable means of assessing and comparing performance. We present here a reference set of serum and plasma samples to facilitate the validation of biomarkers for resectable pancreatic cancer. The reference set includes a large cohort of stage I-II pancreatic cancer patients, recruited from 5 different institutions, and relevant control groups. We characterized the performance of the current best serological biomarker for pancreatic cancer, CA 19–9, using plasma samples from the reference set to provide a benchmark for future biomarker studies and to further our knowledge of CA 19–9 in early-stage pancreatic cancer and the control groups. CA 19–9 distinguished pancreatic cancers from the healthy and chronic pancreatitis groups with an average sensitivity and specificity of 70–74%, similar to previous studies using all stages of pancreatic cancer. Chronic pancreatitis patients did not show CA 19–9 elevations, but patients with benign biliary obstruction had elevations nearly as high as the cancer patients. We gained additional information about the biomarker by comparing two distinct assays. The two CA 9–9 assays agreed well in overall performance but diverged in measurements of individual samples, potentially due to subtle differences in antibody specificity as revealed by glycan array analysis. Thus, the reference set promises be a valuable resource for biomarker validation and comparison, and the CA 19–9 data presented here will be useful for benchmarking and for exploring relationships to CA 19–9."
https://openalex.org/W2193791846,"The effects of ionizing radiation on biological cells have been reported in several literatures. Most of them were mainly concerned with doses greater than 0.01 Gy and were also concerned with gamma rays. On the other hand, the studies on very low dose fast neutrons (VLDFN) are rare. In this study, we have investigated the effects of VLDFN on cell membrane and protein secondary structure of rat erythrocytes. Twelve female Wistar rats were irradiated with neutrons of total dose 0.009 Gy (241Am-Be, 0.2 mGy/h) and twelve others were used as control. Blood samples were taken at the 0, 4th, 8th, and 12th days postirradiation. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of rat erythrocytes were recorded. Second derivative and curve fitting were used to analysis FTIR spectra. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was used to classify group spectra. The second derivative and curve fitting of FTIR spectra revealed that the most significant alterations in the cell membrane and protein secondary structure upon neutron irradiation were detected after 4 days postirradiation. The increase in membrane polarity, phospholipids chain length, packing, and unsaturation were noticed from the corresponding measured FTIR area ratios. This may be due to the membrane lipid peroxidation. The observed band shift in the CH2 stretching bands toward the lower frequencies may be associated with the decrease in membrane fluidity. The curve fitting of the amide I revealed an increase in the percentage area of α-helix opposing a decrease in the β-structure protein secondary structure, which may be attributed to protein denaturation. The results provide detailed insights into the VLDFN effects on erythrocytes. VLDFN can cause an oxidative stress to the irradiated erythrocytes, which appears clearly after 4 days postirradiation."
https://openalex.org/W1917329082,"The actin cytoskeleton is composed of a highly dynamic network of filamentous proteins, yet the molecular mechanism that regulates its organization and remodeling remains elusive. In this study, Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF)-1 loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments reveal that polymerized actin cytoskeleton (F-actin) in HeLa cells is disorganized by NHERF1, whereas actin protein expression levels exhibit no detectable change. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying actin cytoskeleton disorganization by NHERF1, a combined 2-dimensional electrophoresis-matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry approach was used to screen for proteins regulated by NHERF1 in HeLa cells. α-Actinin-4, an actin cross-linking protein, was identified. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation studies showed the α-actinin-4 carboxyl-terminal region specifically interacted with the NHERF1 postsynaptic density 95/disc-large/zona occludens-1 domain. The NHERF1/α-actinin-4 interaction increased α-actinin-4 ubiquitination and decreased its expression levels, resulting in actin cytoskeleton disassembly. Our study identified α-actinin-4 as a novel NHERF1 interaction partner and provided new insights into the regulatory mechanism of the actin cytoskeleton by NHERF1."
https://openalex.org/W2213723615,"Esophageal cancer-related gene 2 (ECRG2) is a newer tumor suppressor whose function in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis remains to be elucidated. Here we show that ECRG2 expression was upregulated in response to DNA damage, and increased ECRG2 expression induced growth suppression in cancer cells but not in non-cancerous epithelial cells. ECRG2-mediated growth suppression was associated with activation of caspases and marked reduction in the levels of apoptosis inhibitor, X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). ECRG2, via RNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR), regulated XIAP mRNA stability and expression. Furthermore, ECRG2 increased HuR ubiquitination and degradation but was unable to modulate the non-ubiquitinable mutant form of HuR. We also identified missense and frame-shift ECRG2 mutations in various human malignancies and noted that, unlike wild-type ECRG2, one cancer-derived ECRG2 mutant harboring glutamic acid instead of valine at position 30 (V30E) failed to induce cell death and activation of caspases. This naturally occurring V30E mutant also did not suppress XIAP and HuR. Importantly, the V30E mutant overexpressing cancer cells acquired resistance against multiple anticancer drugs, thus suggesting that ECRG2 mutations appear to have an important role in the acquisition of anticancer drug resistance in a subset of human malignancies."

https://openalex.org/W2219697547,"Vascular calcification (VC) is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and contributes to cardiovascular mortality. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is present in human artery, senses extracellular calcium and may directly modulate VC. Objective: to investigate the association between arterial cyclic strain, CaSR expression and VC. Methods and Results: human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMC) were cultured under static or strained conditions, with exposure to CaSR agonists, the calcimimetic R568, and after CaSR silencing and over-expression. High extracellular calcium reduced CaSR expression and promoted osteochondrogenic transformation and calcium deposition. This was partially prevented by cyclic strain and exposure to R568. CaSR silencing enhanced calcification and osteochondrogenic transformation, whereas CaSR over-expression attenuated this procalcific response, demonstrating a central role for the CaSR in the response to cyclic strain and regulation of VC. In arterial explants from CKD patients (n = 11) and controls (n = 9), exposure to R568 did not significantly alter calcium deposition, osteochondrogenic markers or total artery calcium content. Conclusions: physiological mechanical strain is important for arterial homeostasis and may protect arteries from VC. The beneficial effects of cyclic strain may be mediated via the CaSR."
https://openalex.org/W2247270077,"Nestin is widely expressed in numerous tumors and has become a diagnostic and prognostic indicator. However, the exact mechanism by which nestin contributes to tumor malignancy remains poorly understood. Here, we found marked upregulation of nestin expression in highly proliferative and invasive gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) specimens. Nestin knockdown in GIST cells reduced the proliferative and invasive activity owing to a decrease of mitochondrial intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Furthermore, nestin was co-localized with mitochondria, and knockdown of nestin increased mitochondrial elongation and influenced the mitochondrial function, including oxygen consumption rates, ATP generation and mitochondrial membrane potential and so on. In exploring the underlying mechanism, we demonstrated nestin knockdown inhibited the mitochondrial recruitment of Dynamin-related protein1 and induced the change of mitochondrial dynamics. Thus, nestin may have an important role in GIST malignancy by regulating mitochondrial dynamics and altering intracellular ROS levels. The findings provide new clues to reveal mechanisms by which nestin mediates the proliferation and invasion of GISTs."

The limited number of prognostic studies in this population support the need of mortality prediction evaluation in this context. Objective The objective of this study is to analyze the performance of Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II and 3 in patients undergoing NIV in an ImCU. Additionally, we searched for new variables that could be useful to customize these scores, in order to improve mortality prediction. Design Cohort study with prospectively collected data from all patients admitted to a single center ImCU who received NIV. The SAPS II and 3 scores with their respective predicted mortality rates were calculated. Discrimination and calibration were evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test for the models, respectively. Binary logistic regression was used to identify new variables to customize the scores for mortality prediction in this setting. Patients The study included 241 patients consecutively admitted to an ImCU staffed by hospitalists from April 2006 to December 2013. Key Results The observed in-hospital mortality was 32.4% resulting in a Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) of 1.35 for SAPS II and 0.68 for SAPS 3. Mortality discrimination based on the AUC was 0.73 for SAPS II and 0.69 for SAPS 3. Customized models including immunosuppression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute pulmonary edema (APE), lactic acid, pCO2 and haemoglobin levels showed better discrimination than old scores with similar calibration power. Conclusions These results suggest that SAPS II and 3 should be customized with additional patient-risk factors to improve mortality prediction in patients undergoing NIV in intermediate care."

We identified a novel type II PAM, (R)-7-bromo-N-(piperidin-3-yl)benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxamide (Br-PBTC), which both increases activation and reactivates desensitized nAChRs. This compound increases acetylcholine-evoked responses of α2* and α4* nAChRs but is without effect on α3* or α6* nAChRs (* indicates the presence of other nAChR subunits). Br-BPTC acts from the C-terminal extracellular sequences of α4 subunits, which is also a PAM site for steroid hormone estrogens such as 17β-estradiol. Br-PBTC is much more potent than estrogens. Like 17β-estradiol, the non-steroid Br-PBTC only requires one α4 subunit to potentiate nAChR function, and its potentiation is stronger with more α4 subunits. This feature enables Br-BPTC to potentiate activation of (α4β2)(α6β2)β3 but not (α6β2)2β3 nAChRs. Therefore, this compound is potentially useful in vivo for determining functions of different α6* nAChR subtypes. Besides activation, Br-BPTC affects desensitization of nAChRs induced by sustained exposure to agonists. After minutes of exposure to agonists, Br-PBTC reactivated short term desensitized nAChRs that have at least two α4 subunits but not those with only one. Three α4 subunits were required for Br-BPTC to reactivate long term desensitized nAChRs. These data suggest that higher PAM occupancy promotes channel opening more efficiently and overcomes short and long term desensitization.

There are interests in developing PAMs because agonists both activate and desensitize nAChRs and because subtype selectivity is hard to achieve with agonists due to similarity between ACh binding in different nAChR subtypes. By contrast, PAMs enhance nAChR function in an activity-dependent manner, potentially modulating the endogenous pattern of signaling rather than constantly activating or desensitizing nAChRs. PAMs also increase the potential for subtype specificity. This is because diversity of PAM binding sites in nAChRs provides better chances to develop selective therapeutics than does targeting the relatively similar ACh binding sites. nicotinic acetylcholine receptor acetylcholine (R)-7-bromo-N-(piperidin-3-yl)benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxamide dihydro-β-erythroidine hydrobromide positive allosteric modulator.

Type II PAMs not only increase peak responses but also the duration of channel opening by delaying desensitization. This makes type II PAMs especially efficacious. In some cases they can act as allosteric agonists (8.Gill J.K. Savolainen M. Young G.T. Zwart R. Sher E. Millar N.S.

Understanding the pharmacology and potentiation mechanism of PAMs should facilitate design of more potent and selective modulators. There is no direct correlation between where a PAM binds and which type of PAM it is (6.Williams D.K. Wang J. Papke R.L.

Discovering how this site, which is distant from both agonist binding sites and the channel gate, influences activation and desensitization should provide new insights on the structure and function of nAChRs.

Some estrogens act as PAMs through the C-tail of α4 (14.Paradiso K. Zhang J. Steinbach J.H. The C terminus of the human nicotinic α4β2 receptor forms a binding site required for potentiation by an estrogenic steroid.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6561-6568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their PAM effect increases with the number of α4 subunits with free C-tails in a nAChR (15.Jin X. Steinbach J.H.

By contrast, Br-PBTC potentiates α4 concatemers and free α4 subunits. Using this novel PAM and various concatemers, we investigated how PAM site occupancy influences activation and desensitization of nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cell lines. We found that occupying one PAM site is sufficient to potentiate nAChR activation, and higher PAM site occupancy promotes nAChR opening and alleviates short and long term desensitization more efficiently. This C-tail potentiation mechanism might be applicable to other nAChR subtypes and facilitate development of other subtype-selective drugs. Methodology for preparing reactants for synthesizing Br-PBTC is described as follows. 3-Bromo-2-fluorobenzaldehyde (406.0 mg, 2.0 mmol), ethyl mercaptoacetate (242 μl, 2.2 mmol), triethylamine (556 μl, 4.0 mmol), and acetonitrile (10 ml) were added to a 50-ml round-bottom flask and stirred at 60 °C overnight. The acetonitrile was removed in vacuo, and the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (30 ml) and water (10 ml). The layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (2×).

Ethyl 7-bromobenzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (500.0 mg, 1.7 mmol), lithium hydroxide (250.0 mg, 10.4 mmol), tetrahydrofuran (6 ml), and water (8 ml) were added to a 50-ml round-bottom flask and stirred at room temperature until the starting material was consumed as judged by thin layer chromatography analysis. The majority of the tetrahydrofuran was removed in vacuo. The resulting crude mixture was acidified with aqueous hydrochloric acid (∼pH = 3) and cooled in an ice bath. The solids were filtered and washed with cold water (about 6 ml) to give the title compound (392 mg, 90%). A mixture of 7-bromobenzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxylic acid (25.6 mg, 0.1 mmol), (R)-tert-butyl 3-aminopiperidine-1-carboxylate (24.0 mg, 0.12 mmol), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (52 μl, 0.3 mmol), and 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxid hexafluorophosphate (57.0 mg, 0.15 mmol) in dimethylformamide (2 ml) was stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (15 ml) and washed with water (4 ml, 3×). The organic layer was dried (MgSO4) and concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (5 ml), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (5 ml) was added, and the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was concentrated in vacuo to give a crude product, which was purified by reverse-phase preparative HPLC (A: methanol and acetonitrile (1:1, v/v); B: water containing TFA (0.1%, v/v)). The title compound was obtained as the TFA salt (31.6 mg, 70%). 1H NMR (CD3OD, 400 MHz) δ 8.10 (s, 1H), 7.90 (dd, 1H, J = 0.8, 8.0 Hz), 7.63 (dd, 1H, J = 0.8, 7.6 Hz), 7.36 (t, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz), 4.11 (m, 1H), 3.34 (m, 1H), 3.13 (m, 1H), 2.74 (m, 2H), 2.08 (m, 1H), 1.69 (m, 2H). LC/MS (ESI) 339, 341 (M+H). A 10 mm stock of Br-PBTC was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. Dilutions of drugs were prepared daily in testing buffer before use.

The trimeric concatemer β2(QAP)nα4(QAP)nβ2 (abbreviated as β2-α4-β2) was synthesized through linking together β2(QAP)nα4 with QAP linker and β2. β2(QAP)nα4 was made similarly as β3(QAP)nα6, which was described (20.Ley C.K. Kuryatov A. Wang J. Lindstrom J.M. Efficient expression of functional (α6β2)2β3 AChRs in Xenopus oocytes from free subunits using slightly modified α6 subunits.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e103244Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A BspEI site was introduced at the end of the mature peptide of β2 using a CCCAGCTCCAAGTCCGGACCTTCCTCATCTC oligonucleotide. The (QAP)n linker was then inserted between the BspEI site at the end of β2 and the FspI site at the beginning of α4. At the end of the coding domain of α4 in the β2QAPα4 dimer we introduced a AgeI site (GCTGGCTGGCATGATCACCGGTGGGACCGGGAGCCTG oligonucleotide), which is complementary to the XmaI site of the second (QAP)n linker in the concatemer β2(QAP)nα4(QAP)nβ2. The second (QAP)n linker was prepared from the β2(QAP)nα4 piece. We mutated the FspI site at the beginning of the α4 sequence into a BstBI site. The second (QAP)n linker with new restriction sites was cut out using XmaI site and BstBI enzymes. We introduced a BstBI restriction site at the beginning of the mature peptide of β2 using a GGCATGATCTTCGAAACGGATACAGAGGAG oligonucleotide. These allowed us to link together the β2QAPα4 dimer with the AgeI site, the QAP linker with XmaI and BstBI ends, and the β2 subunits with the BstBI restriction site at the beginning of mature peptide. The resulting construct was recloned into the pBS SK(−) vector using the EcoRI restriction enzyme. The resulting clone linearized with EcoRV for expression in oocytes. Syntheses of tetrameric and pentameric concatemers (i.e. β2-α4-β2-α4 and β3-α6-β2-α4-β2) was described (21.Kuryatov A. Olale F.A. Choi C. Lindstrom J.

Pharmacol. 2011; 79: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Four of the five chimeras of α3 and α4 subunits were prepared previously (23.Kuryatov A. Lindstrom J. Expression of functional human α6β2β3* AChRs in Xenopus oocytes achieved through subunit chimeras and concatemers.Mol. Pharmacol. 2011; 79: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Chimeras were numbered according to the amino acid sequences of the mature subunit. α3(1–440)/α4(561–594) was prepared by ligating three pieces of DNA: a 0.6-kb fragment from the NcoI to BstEII site of the α3 subunit, a 1-kb fragment from the HidIII to BstEII site of the α3 subunit, and a 3.1-kb fragment from the NcoI to HidIII site of the α4 subunit in the pSP64 vector. The ligation mixture was transformed into XL10-Gold ultracompetent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the right clone was chosen from a restriction enzyme digest. A C-tail mutant (noted as α4AAC) was obtained by mutating the last four amino acids of the α4 subunit, alanine-glycine-methionine-isoleucine, to alanine-alanine-cysteine followed by a stop codon. Mutations were introduced using the PfuUltra high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. After linearization and purification of cDNAs, cRNA transcripts were prepared in vitro using mMessage mMachine kits (Ambion, Austin, TX). Concentrations of cDNAs and cRNAs were calculated by spectrophotometry. All cells were maintained as described previously (17.Wang F. Nelson M.E. Kuryatov A. Olale F. Cooper J. Keyser K. Lindstrom J.

The human embryonic kidney tsA201 (HEK) cell lines stably expressing human α4β2, α4β4, α2β2, α2β4, α3β2, and α3β4 were described (13.Wang J. Kuryatov A. Sriram A. Jin Z. Kamenecka T.M. Kenny P.J.

Choi C.H. Zhou Y. Lindstrom J. Alternate stoichiometries of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). HEK cells that express only one stoichiometry, either (α4β2)2α4 or (α4β2)2β2, were obtained by transfecting a dimeric concatemer β2(QAP)nα4 cell line with α4 or β2 subunits. 4A. Kuryatov, J. Wang, and J. Lindstrom, manuscript in preparation. For functional tests of nAChRs expressed in HEK cells, we used a FLEXstation (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) bench-top scanning fluorometer as described by Kuryatov et al. (25.Kuryatov A. Luo J. Cooper J. Lindstrom J. Nicotine acts as a pharmacological chaperone to up-regulate human α4β2 acetylcholine receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1839-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To increase the expression level of α2β3, α3β2, and (α4β2)2β2 nAChRs, the plates were incubated at 29 °C for 20 h before being tested. A membrane potential fluorescent indicator kit (Molecular Devices) was used according to the manufacturer's protocols. In PAM experiments, serial dilutions of Br-PBTC were manually added to the assay plate 15 min before the addition of agonists during recording unless otherwise noted. In short term desensitization experiments, 6 min after agonists were added to cell culture wells, Br-PBTC or dihydro-β-erythroidine hydrobromide (DHβE) was automatically added into the wells during recording. In long term desensitization experiments, nicotine or DHβE was incubated with cells for 6 h before recording. Br-PBTC with or without DHβE was added to the cell culture wells during recording. Each data point was averaged from three to four responses from separate wells. The potency and maximum efficacy of drugs were calculated by fitting the Hill equation to the concentration/response relationship using a nonlinear least squares curve fitting method (Kaleidagraph; Abelbeck/Synergy, Reading, PA): I(x) = Imax [xnH/(xnH + EC50nH)], where I(x) is the peak current measured at the drug concentration x, Imax is the maximum current peak at the saturating concentration, EC50 is the drug concentration required to achieve half of the maximum response, and nH is the Hill coefficient. Oocytes were removed surgically from Xenopus laevis and defolliculated as described (13.Wang J. Kuryatov A. Sriram A. Jin Z. Kamenecka T.M. Kenny P.J. Lindstrom J.

Lindstrom J. “Orphan” α6 nicotinic AChR subunit can form a functional heteromeric acetylcholine receptor.Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Oocyte injections were performed within 48 h after surgery. Oocytes were injected with 20–40 ng of concatemer cRNA and free single subunit at a 1:1 ratio. A total of 2–20 ng of cRNA was injected for free wild type or chimeric α and β subunits at a 4:1 ratio to force expression of the (α)3(β2)2 stoichiometry or at 1:4 ratio to force expression of the (α)2(β)3 stoichiometry. To express homomeric α7 nAChRs, 70 ng of cRNA was injected to each oocyte. The function was assayed 3–7 days after injection. Currents in oocytes were measured using the OpusXpress 6000A (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA), an automated two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier that enables recording up to eight oocytes in parallel (13.Wang J. Kuryatov A. Sriram A. Jin Z. Kamenecka T.M. Kenny P.J. Lindstrom J. An accessory agonist binding site promotes activation of α4β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 13907-13918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Oocytes were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of −50 mV. 200 μl of drugs were delivered on top of oocytes for 4 s (s) through the sidewall of the bath to minimize disturbance to oocytes. Between drug applications, oocytes received a 30-s prewash and 223-s post-wash of ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) with 0.5 μm atropine perfused through the bath at a rate of 3 ml/min unless otherwise noted. Peak amplitudes of experimental responses were calculated relative to ACh responses to normalize the data and compensate for variable expression levels among oocytes. The PAM effect of Br-PBTC was calculated by comparing increased responses with Br-PBTC relative to responses to ACh alone. Mean and S.E. were calculated from normalized responses. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test. More than four oocytes were tested for each experiment. Pre-application of Br-PBTC gave slightly higher PAM effects on wild type and chimeric nAChRs than co-application with agonists. But conclusions were the same for both application methods. To save time, we thereafter used the co-application method to evaluate the PAM effects in experiments performed in oocytes. In short term desensitization experiments, 1 mm ACh was applied to oocytes for 4 s at the rate of 3 ml/min followed by another 56 s at 0.75 ml/min. Then the oocytes were incubated for an additional 5 min in a static bath before a co-application with 1 mm ACh plus 3 μm Br-PBTC for 4 s at 3 ml/min. Control experiments were performed on the same oocytes before Br-PBTC applications following the same protocol in which 3 μm Br-PBTC was replaced with 0.1% (v/v) DMSO. Reactivation by Br-PBTC was calculated by normalizing the response of 3 μm Br-PBTC to the response of ACh applied before Br-PBTC. In antagonist inhibition experiments, α-conotoxin MII was applied for 4 s at the rate of 3 ml/min followed by another 56 s at 0.75 ml/min. To fully block ACh activation, the oocytes were then incubated for an additional 16 min in a static bath before co-application of ACh (3 μm) or ACh together with Br-PBTC (3 μm). To investigate the subtype selectivity of compound Br-PBTC (Fig. 1A), we tested its ability to potentiate ACh activation of various subtypes of nAChRs stably expressed in HEK cells (Fig. 1B). Br-PBTC increased the activation by EC20 ACh of α2- and α4-containing nAChRs by 119–560% (Table 1). EC50 values for Br-PBTC ranged from 0.261 to 0.660 μm (Table 1), equal to the most potent nAChR PAMs (6.Williams D.K. Wang J. Papke R.L.

Toxicol. 2015; 116: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). At >3 μm, Br-PBTC inhibited its own potentiation effect, perhaps because it behaved as an open channel blocker like some other nAChR PAMs and ACh itself (26.Weltzin M.M. Schulte M.K. Pharmacological characterization of the allosteric modulator desformylflustrabromine and its interaction with α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor orthosteric ligands.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2010; 334: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Br-PBTC did not alter activation by ACh of α3β2 or α3β4 nAChRs (Fig. 1B). We also evaluated the effect of Br-PBTC (up to 3 μm) on activation on homomeric α7 nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The maximum increased peak response by Br-PBTC was 33.9 ± 33.8%. Because the potentiation is small with large error and only appeared at 1 μm Br-PBTC, we do not think that Br-PBTC potentiates activation of α7 nAChRs. Br-PBTC did not activate these heteromeric or homomeric nAChR subtypes by itself (data not shown). Therefore, Br-PBTC is an α2 and α4 nAChR subtype-selective PAM.TABLE 1Potencies and maximum efficacies of potentiation by Br-PBTC on activation by EC20–30 AChnAChR subtypesBr-PBTC EC50nHillImaxμm%α2β20.660 ± 0.3771.07 ± 0.47560 ± 102α2β40.286 ± 0.0391.10 ± 0.09202 ± 7α3β2NDND<0α3β4NDND<21α4β20.446 ± 0.0861."

https://openalex.org/W2236502800,"Accumulating evidences have shown the association between aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRs) and cancer, where these small regulatory RNAs appear to dictate the cell fate by regulating all the main biological processes. We demonstrated the responsibility of the circuitry connecting the oncomiR-221&222 with the tumor suppressors miR-126&126* in melanoma development and progression. According to the inverse correlation between endogenous miR-221&222 and miR-126&126*, respectively increasing or decreasing with malignancy, their enforced expression or silencing was sufficient for a reciprocal regulation. In line with the opposite roles of these miRs, protein analyses confirmed the reverse expression pattern of miR-126&126*-targeted genes that were induced by miR-221&222. Looking for a central player in this complex network, we revealed the dual regulation of AP2α, on one side directly targeted by miR-221&222 and on the other a transcriptional activator of miR-126&126*. We showed the chance of restoring miR-126&126* expression in metastatic melanoma to reduce the amount of mature intracellular heparin-binding EGF like growth factor, thus preventing promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger delocalization and maintaining its repression on miR-221&222 promoter. Thus, the low-residual quantity of these two miRs assures the release of AP2α expression, which in turn binds to and induces miR-126&126* transcription. All together these results point to an unbalanced ratio functional to melanoma malignancy between these two couples of miRs. During progression this balance gradually moves from miR-126&126* toward miR-221&222. This circuitry, besides confirming the central role of AP2α in orchestrating melanoma development and/or progression, further displays the significance of these miRs in cancer and the option of utilizing them for novel therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W2243252304,"Despite immense interest in using antimalarials as autophagy inhibitors to treat cancer, it remains unclear whether these agents act predominantly via autophagy inhibition or whether other pathways direct their anti-cancer properties. By comparing the treatment effects of the antimalarials chloroquine (CQ) and quinacrine (Q) on KRAS mutant lung cancer cells, we demonstrate that inhibition of the oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) is required for antimalarial induced apoptosis. Despite inhibiting autophagy, neither CQ treatment nor RNAi against autophagy regulators (ATGs) promote cell death. In contrast, Q triggers high levels of apoptosis, both in vitro and in vivo, and this phenotype requires both autophagy inhibition and p53-dependent inhibition of the oxPPP. Simultaneous genetic targeting of the oxPPP and autophagy is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in lung cancer cells, including cells lacking p53. Thus, in addition to reduced autophagy, oxPPP inhibition serves as an important determinant of antimalarial cytotoxicity in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2177973958,"Enhancer trapping (ET) is a powerful approach to establish tissue- or cell-specific reporters and identify expression patterns of uncharacterized genes. Although a number of enhancer-trapping vectors have been developed and a large library of fish lines with distinct tissue- or cell-specific expression of reporter genes have been generated, the specificity and efficiency of trapping vectors need to be improved because of the bias interaction of minimal promoters with genomic enhancers. Accordingly, we generated an enhancer-trapping vector pTME that contains a minimal mouse metallothionein gene (mMTI) promoter upstream of EGFP reporter. In the first round of screening, twelve zebrafish lines that carry a single copy of ET cassettes were characterized to have tissue- or cell-specific EGFP expression. One of the highly conserved noncoding elements near an insertion site of trapping cassettes was characterized as an enhancer that can specifically regulate the expression of EGFP in cells of the central nervous system. In addition, the pTME vector contains a mutation-cassette that is able to effectively block the transcription of an endogenous gene in an ET line with ubiquitous EGFP expression. Thus, the pTME vector can be used as an alternative tool for both enhancer trapping and mutagenesis across a target genome."
https://openalex.org/W2192213321,"The extremely high concentration of macromolecules in a eukaryotic cell nucleus indicates that the nucleoplasm is a crowded macromolecular solution in which large objects tend to gather together due to crowding forces. It has been shown experimentally that crowding forces support the integrity of various nuclear compartments. However, little is known about their role in control of chromatin dynamics in vivo. Here, we experimentally addressed the possible role of crowding forces in spatial organization of the eukaryotic genome. Using the mouse β-globin domain as a model, we demonstrated that spatial juxtaposition of the remote regulatory elements of this domain in globin-expressing cells may be lost and restored by manipulation of the level of macromolecular crowding. In addition to proving the role of crowding forces in shaping interphase chromatin, our results suggest that the folding of the chromatin fiber is a major determinant in juxtaposing remote genomic elements."

These structured domains are separated by an 82-residue interdomain linker (IDL) region (Fig. 1A). The dsRBD additionally has an ∼22-amino acid unstructured linker between the two dsRBMs that is proposed to wrap around the dsRNA to allow optimal interaction of each dsRBM with the A-form RNA helix (2.Nanduri S. Carpick B.W. Yang Y. Williams B. R Qin J. Structure of the double-stranded RNA-binding domain of the protein kinase PKR reveals the molecular basis of its dsRNA-mediated activation.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5458-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The KD fold possesses two lobes connected by a small hinge region, with distinct functional roles: the smaller N-terminal lobe mediates PKR dimerization, whereas the larger C-terminal lobe interacts with the eIF2α substrate (3.Dar A.C.

The IDL separating the regulatory domain from the catalytic domain is unstructured in solution but has been speculated to play a role in mediating communication between the two structured domains during activation by dsRNA (4.McKenna S.A.

Unactivated PKR exists in an open conformation capable of binding nucleotides.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9074-9084Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). How the kinase activity of PKR is controlled in the absence of activating RNA has been the subject of debate. An autoinhibition model for PKR activation was originally proposed in which direct interaction of the N-terminal dsRBD and KD inhibits the latent kinase activity before the dsRNA-mediated release of this inhibition (6.Wu S. Kaufman R.J. A model for the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent dimerization and activation of the dsRNA-activated protein kinase PKR.J. Biol.

The regulation of the protein kinase PKR by RNA.Biochimie. 1996; 78: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence argued for an alternative model in which dsRNA-mediated PKR dimerization is the critical step in activation (8.Cole J.L. Activation of PKR: an open and shut case?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 57-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Latent PKR binds ATP, exists predominantly as an extended monomeric structure, and is capable of forming weak dimers in solution and autophosphorylation in a PKR concentration-dependent manner (>500 nm) in the absence of dsRNA (5.Lemaire P.A.

Constitutive PKR activation from fusion of heterologous dimerization domains to the isolated PKR KD provides further evidence for the sufficiency of PKR dimerization for kinase activation (13.Ung T.L.

J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3674-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Finally, the identification of a cellular non-coding RNA inhibitor of latent PKR, the loss of which is implicated in various cancers (15.Lee K. Kunkeaw N. Jeon S.H. Lee I. Johnson B.H. Kang G.Y.

A novel type of non-coding RNA, nc886, implicated in tumor sensing and suppression.Genomics Inform. 2015; 13: 26-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggests a necessity for exogenous control of PKR kinase activity. The best characterized role of PKR is as a sensor of cytosolic dsRNA. dsRNA represents a potent pathogen-associated molecular pattern, present in some viral genomes or produced as a consequence of viral gene expression and replication (17.Takeuchi O. Akira S. Pattern recognition receptors and inflammation.Cell. 2010; 140: 805-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5739) Google Scholar). Viral dsRNA-promoted PKR homodimerization leads to subsequent autophosphorylation and kinase activation (8.Cole J.L. Activation of PKR: an open and shut case?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 57-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18.Dey M. Mann B.R. Anshu A.

Chem. 2014; 289: 5747-5757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Activated PKR phosphorylates Ser-51 of the α subunit of eIF2, converting eIF2 into an inhibitor of its guanine exchange factor, eIF2B (1.Donnelly N. Gorman A.M. Gupta S. Samali A. The eIF2α kinases: their structures and functions.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70: 3493-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). eIF2 is thus sequestered in an inactive form, blocking initiation of cellular protein translation. Diverse viruses have evolved varied strategies to circumvent this PKR-mediated blockade of translation (19.Dauber B. Wolff T. Activation of the antiviral kinase PKR and viral countermeasures.Viruses. 2009; 1: 523-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), including expression of “RNA decoys” that bind but do not activate PKR. The best characterized of these viral RNA inhibitors of PKR is the essential pro-viral non-coding “virus-associated” RNA (VA RNA) present in at least one copy in the genome of all human adenoviruses (20.Ma Y. Mathews M.B. Structure, function, and evolution of adenovirus-associated RNA: a phylogenetic approach.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5083-5099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Mathews M.B. Shenk T.

Adenovirus VA RNA: an essential pro-viral non-coding RNA.Virus Res. 2015; 10.1016/j.virusres.2015.06.018PubMed Google Scholar). Other viral non-coding RNAs capable of inhibiting PKR include EBER-1 of Epstein-Barr virus (23.Clarke P.A. Schwemmle M. Schickinger J. Hilse K. Clemens M.J.

Agy M. Hovanessian A.G. Sonenberg N. Katze M.G. The integrity of the stem structure of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat-responsive sequence of RNA is required for interaction with the interferon-induced 68,000-Mr protein kinase.J. Virol. 1991; 65: 632-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the model for PKR activation via dimerization on dsRNA is well established (8.Cole J.L. Activation of PKR: an open and shut case?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 57-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the precise mechanism of action of these viral RNA inhibitors is less clear. Recent evidence from small angle x-ray scattering studies suggests that the structure of VA RNAI is precisely tuned to present a single high affinity PKR binding site (26.Launer-Felty K. Wong C.J. Cole J.L. Structural analysis of adenovirus VAI RNA defines the mechanism of inhibition of PKR.Biophys. J. 2015; 108: 748-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, whether such viral RNAs function by binding PKR exclusively via its N-terminal dsRNA domain (dsRBDs) to block PKR dimerization, or additionally require regions within the C-terminal KD or the IDL, is not known. Here, we present the design and analysis of PKR IDL deletion and human-rat PKR domain swap variants to address the potential role(s) of the IDL and each PKR domain to RNA-mediated regulation. Our results show that complete deletion of the human PKR (hPKR) IDL has no effect on the activation or inhibition of kinase activity by RNA. In contrast, we find that both the N-terminal dsRBD and the C-terminal KD of hPKR are required for inhibition by human viral non-coding RNAs. IDL deletion variants of hPKR within the pET-hPKR/PPase (10.Lemaire P.A. Lary J. Cole J.L. Mechanism of PKR activation: dimerization and kinase activation in the absence of double-stranded RNA.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were created by MEGAWHOP mutagenesis (27.Miyazaki K. MEGAWHOP cloning: a method of creating random mutagenesis libraries via megaprimer PCR of whole plasmids.Methods Enzymol. 2011; 498: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 28.Miyazaki K. Takenouchi M. Creating random mutagenesis libraries using megaprimer PCR of whole plasmid.Biotechniques. 2002; 33: 1033-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) based on sequence alignment with murine homologs (mouse, rat, and hamster). Three hPKR IDL deletions were created (Fig. 1, A and B): IDLΔ1 (ΔT197-T212), IDLΔ2 (ΔT170-L227), and IDLΔ3 (ΔT170-D251). The alignment also identified a region in the human PKR KD that is absent in the other homologs and previously deleted in the human PKR KD construct used to determine its crystal structure in complex with eIF2α (3.Dar A.C. Dever T.E. Sicheri F. Higher-order substrate recognition of elF2α by the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR.Cell. 2005; 122: 887-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This kinase deletion (ΔD338-N350; Fig. 1A) was additionally included in some of the constructs generated in this study (those denoted with asterisks). Other than hPKR-IDLΔ1 and hPKR-IDLΔ1*, the hPKR IDL deletion variants required the use of an N-terminal SUMO tag (obtained by PCR amplification of the Smt3 sequence from the pE-SUMO plasmid vector; denoted S) for optimal expression and solubility. S-hPKR-IDLΔ2, S-hPKR-IDLΔ2*, and S-hPKR-IDLΔ3* in the pET/PPase background were generated by overlap extension PCR to add the N-terminal His6-SUMO tag and MEGAWHOP mutagenesis to generate the deletions. DNA encoding rat PKR (rPKR) with codon optimization for expression in Escherichia coli was obtained from Genscript and subcloned into the pET/PPase plasmid with an N-terminal His6-SUMO tag after digestion with KpnI and BamHI to create an S-rPKR expression construct. Human-rat chimeric PKR expression plasmids were created based on alignment of hPKR with the mouse and rat sequences. The region spanning Thr-170 to Ser-192 of hPKR was taken as the “breakpoint” for domain switching in order to generate S-r/hPKR (rat dsRBD and human KD) and S-h/rPKR (human dsRBD and rat KD). E. coli Rosetta2(DE3) cells were transformed with each PKR-encoding plasmid and plated on LB-agar containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml). For PKR constructs without an N-terminal His6-SUMO tag, soluble protein expression was accomplished using overnight autoinduction (29.Studier F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high-density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4127) Google Scholar) at 20 °C after initial growth at 37 °C for 6 h. For N-terminal His6-SUMO-tagged proteins, cells were grown in Terrific Broth (TB) at 37 °C and induced at mid-log phase using isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm), and growth continued overnight at 20 °C for protein expression. Tagless PKR proteins were purified using three sequential chromatographic steps performed on an ÄKTApurifier10 FPLC system: heparin affinity (HiPrep Heparin 16/10), poly(rI:rC) dsRNA-affinity (30.Wahid A.M. Coventry V.K. Conn G.L. Systematic deletion of the adenovirus-associated RNAI terminal stem reveals a surprisingly active RNA inhibitor of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17485-17493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and gel filtration (Superdex 200 10/300). Each step was performed with the column pre-equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7–8.5; adjusted to at least one unit above the predicted protein pI) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, except that EDTA was omitted for the final gel filtration column. Proteins were eluted from the heparin-affinity column using a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.15 to 1.5 m over five column volumes. Pooled protein fractions were diluted with the same buffer without NaCl to reduce the NaCl concentration to ∼150 mm and applied to the poly(rI:rC) dsRNA affinity column. PKR proteins were again eluted using a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.15 to 1.5 m over five column volumes. Pooled PKR-containing fractions were either flash-frozen for storage at −80 °C or applied directly to the gel filtration column and eluted isocratically. PKR-containing fractions from the gel filtration column were pooled, and the protein was used directly in the experiments described. For N-terminal His6-SUMO-tagged PKR proteins, Ni2+ affinity was used as the first step in place of heparin affinity. The column (HisTrap FF Crude 1 ml) was pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris HCl (pH 7–8.5) buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Bound proteins were eluted using an imidazole gradient (20–400 mm, over 10 column volumes) in the same buffer. PKR-containing fractions were pooled, diluted with salt-free buffer to give a final concentration of ∼150 mm NaCl, and further purified using poly(rI:rC) dsRNA affinity and gel filtration chromatographies as described for the tagless proteins. Where used, cleavage of the N-terminal His6-SUMO tag was accomplished by buffer exchange into SUMO cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) and treatment of the fusion protein with SUMO protease (Life Sensors) at 4 °C overnight. Cleaved PKR proteins were purified from the free His6-SUMO tag and uncleaved fusion using a final round of gel filtration chromatography. A truncated form of human adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) VA RNAI (94 nucleotides), which retains full wild-type activity but lacks the entire terminal stem (“TSΔ21”) and a short sequence in the apical stem (“A2dl2”) was in vitro transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase under previously established optimal conditions (31.Pe'ery T.

HIV-1 TAR RNA (59 nucleotides) was also prepared by T7 RNA polymerase run-off transcription using established conditions (33.Gurevich V.V.

General protocols for preparation of plasmid DNA template, RNA in vitro transcription, and RNA purification by denaturing PAGE.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 941: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Transcripts were resolved by preparative denaturing (50% urea) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE; 10% acrylamide), excised from the gel, and recovered by electroelution using a Biotrap device (Schleicher and Schuell). RNAs were annealed in 1× Tris-EDTA buffer and dialyzed overnight against the appropriate assay buffer before use. To verify the absence of dimerized RNA that would confound interpretation of PKR inhibition assays (35.Heinicke L.A. Wong C.J. Lary J. Nallagatla S.R. Diegelman-Parente A. Zheng X. Cole J.L. Bevilacqua P.C. RNA dimerization promotes PKR dimerization and activation.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 390: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), purified HIV-1 TAR RNA was examined by native PAGE (10% acrylamide) and stained with SYBR Gold. Slot blot assays of PKR autophosphorylation contained PKR (0.1 μg) in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.8) with poly(rI:rC) dsRNA (0–100 μg/ml), 20 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml, 6000 Ci/mmol), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol in a total reaction volume of 10 μl. SDS-PAGE assays of PKR autophosphorylation and eIF2α phosphorylation were performed identically but included eIF2α (0.25 μg) in the absence or presence of a single concentration of poly(rI:rC) dsRNA (0.3 μg/ml). Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min and then stopped by the addition of gel loading dye (for SDS-PAGE analysis) or 400 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 200 μm ATP (for slot blot analysis). In the latter case quenched samples were applied promptly to a Bio-Dot SF (Bio-Rad) microfiltration system, and proteins were bound to a nitrocellulose membrane under vacuum. The membrane was washed to remove unreacted [γ-32P]ATP and then air-dried. For both membranes and dried SDS-PAGE gels, the extent of PKR and eIF2α phosphorylation was determined by exposure to a phosphor storage screen and analysis using a Typhoon FLA 7000 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). PKR inhibition assays were performed in a similar manner but included a 10-min preincubation step at 25 °C with the in vitro transcribed RNA (0–100 μm) and PKR (0.1 μg) in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.8) containing 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. Reactions (10 μl final volume) were initiated by the addition of 0.04 μg/ml poly(rI:rC) dsRNA, 20 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml, 6000 Ci/mmol), and 2 mm MgCl2. After a 10-min incubation at 25 °C, the reactions were quenched, and the products were quantified as described above for the activation assays. IC50 values were obtained by non-linear regression analysis using the log(inhibitor) versus response equation in GraphPad Prism software. CD spectra (250–190 nm) of protein (5–10 μm) in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 10% glycerol were recorded at 25 °C on a Jasco J810 spectrophotometer using a quartz cuvette with a 0.1-cm path length and instrument settings of 1-nm bandwidth, 0.2-nm step size, and 16-s averaging time. Spectra were recorded in triplicate and averaged, and background was subtracted before unit conversion to mean residue ellipticity (36.Greenfield N.J. Methods to estimate the conformation of proteins and polypeptides from circular dichroism data.Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were diluted to a concentration of ∼0.2 mg/ml in gel filtration buffer and digested by different ratios of trypsin:PKR (1:10,000, 1:5,000, 1:1,000) at 20 °C for 45 min. The reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Binding affinities of VA RNAI or HIV-1 TAR for select PKR variants were measured using an Auto-iTC200 microcalorimeter (Malvern/MicroCal). Samples were prepared by dialyzing overnight against 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl, and the experiments were performed by titrating RNA (80 μm) into the sample cell containing PKR (10–15 μm) at 25 °C in 16 × 2.5-μl injections with 150-s spacing. Titration curves were fit by a non-linear least squares method in MicroCal Origin software using the single site binding model. hPKR is a 551-amino acid protein with an N-terminal dsRBD (residues 1–169) and C-terminal catalytic domain (KD; residues 252–551) (Fig. 1A) separated by a highly acidic and unstructured IDL. To examine the potential role of the hPKR IDL in dsRNA-mediated activation and inhibition of its kinase activity, we used the known hPKR domain boundaries and sequence alignment with PKR homologs from rodent species as a guide to design three IDL deletion variants (Fig. 1, A and B). Specifically, hPKR-IDLΔ1 and hPKR-IDLΔ2 were designed to mirror the short natural IDL deletion in mouse/rat PKR (mPKR/rPKR) and the larger IDL deletion of variant 2 of the Golden Hamster protein (Mesocricetus auratus PKR), respectively. The third construct, hPKR-IDLΔ3 corresponds to complete deletion of the hPKR IDL. These proteins lack a total of 16, 58, and 82 residues from the hPKR IDL, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). Wild-type hPKR and hPKR-IDLΔ1 were expressed and purified using established protocols (10.Lemaire P.A. Lary J. Cole J.L.

We found that the addition of an N-terminal SUMO (smt3) tag allowed soluble expression of both shorter constructs. Importantly, the addition of the SUMO tag had no discernible effect on hPKR activation or inhibition by poly(rI:rC) dsRNA and Ad2 VA RNAI (30.Wahid A.M. Coventry V.K. Conn G.L.

Additionally, we tested the effect of a short deletion in the KD (residues 338–350), previously shown to reduce the tendency of PKR to form high molecular weight aggregates at high concentration (3.Dar A.C.

The PKR constructs with and without the additional KD deletion expressed similarly and had similar profiles of response to activating and inhibitory dsRNAs (Fig. 2, C and D, and data not shown). Regardless of the presence or absence of an N-terminal SUMO tag or deletions within the IDL or KD, each protein eluted predominantly in a monomeric form from the gel filtration column used as the final step of purification. Wild-type hPKR and each IDL deletion mutant was analyzed by far UV CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3A) after removal o"
https://openalex.org/W2262071732,"PI(4,5)P2 localizes to sites of dense core vesicle exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells and is required for Ca2+-triggered vesicle exocytosis, but the impact of local PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis on exocytosis is poorly understood. Previously, we reported that Ca2+-dependent activation of phospholipase Cη2 (PLCη2) catalyzes PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis, which affected vesicle exocytosis by regulating the activities of the lipid-dependent priming factors CAPS (also known as CADPS) and ubiquitous Munc13-2 in PC12 cells. Here we describe an additional role for PLCη2 in vesicle exocytosis as a Ca2+-dependent regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. Depolarization of neuroendocrine PC12 cells with 56 or 95 mm KCl buffers increased peak Ca2+ levels to ∼400 or ∼800 nm, respectively, but elicited similar numbers of vesicle exocytic events. However, 56 mm K+ preferentially elicited the exocytosis of plasma membrane-resident vesicles, whereas 95 mm K+ preferentially elicited the exocytosis of cytoplasmic vesicles arriving during stimulation. Depolarization with 95 mm K+ but not with 56 mm K+ activated PLCη2 to catalyze PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis. The decrease in PI(4,5)P2 promoted F-actin disassembly, which increased exocytosis of newly arriving vesicles. Consistent with its role as a Ca2+-dependent regulator of the cortical actin cytoskeleton, PLCη2 localized with F-actin filaments. The results highlight the importance of PI(4,5)P2 for coordinating cytoskeletal dynamics with vesicle exocytosis and reveal a new role for PLCη2 as a Ca2+-dependent regulator of F-actin dynamics and vesicle trafficking. PI(4,5)P2 localizes to sites of dense core vesicle exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells and is required for Ca2+-triggered vesicle exocytosis, but the impact of local PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis on exocytosis is poorly understood. Previously, we reported that Ca2+-dependent activation of phospholipase Cη2 (PLCη2) catalyzes PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis, which affected vesicle exocytosis by regulating the activities of the lipid-dependent priming factors CAPS (also known as CADPS) and ubiquitous Munc13-2 in PC12 cells. Here we describe an additional role for PLCη2 in vesicle exocytosis as a Ca2+-dependent regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. Depolarization of neuroendocrine PC12 cells with 56 or 95 mm KCl buffers increased peak Ca2+ levels to ∼400 or ∼800 nm, respectively, but elicited similar numbers of vesicle exocytic events. However, 56 mm K+ preferentially elicited the exocytosis of plasma membrane-resident vesicles, whereas 95 mm K+ preferentially elicited the exocytosis of cytoplasmic vesicles arriving during stimulation. Depolarization with 95 mm K+ but not with 56 mm K+ activated PLCη2 to catalyze PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis. The decrease in PI(4,5)P2 promoted F-actin disassembly, which increased exocytosis of newly arriving vesicles. Consistent with its role as a Ca2+-dependent regulator of the cortical actin cytoskeleton, PLCη2 localized with F-actin filaments. The results highlight the importance of PI(4,5)P2 for coordinating cytoskeletal dynamics with vesicle exocytosis and reveal a new role for PLCη2 as a Ca2+-dependent regulator of F-actin dynamics and vesicle trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2211461765,"Multi-locus effect modeling is a powerful approach for detection of genes influencing a complex disease. Especially for rare variants, we need to analyze multiple variants together to achieve adequate power for detection. In this paper, we propose several parsimonious branching model techniques to assess the joint effect of a group of rare variants in a case-control study. These models implement a data reduction strategy within a likelihood framework and use a weighted score test to assess the statistical significance of the effect of the group of variants on the disease. The primary advantage of the proposed approach is that it performs model-averaging over a substantially smaller set of models supported by the data and thus gains power to detect multi-locus effects. We illustrate these proposed approaches on simulated and real data and study their performance compared to several existing rare variant detection approaches. The primary goal of this paper is to assess if there is any gain in power to detect association by averaging over a number of models instead of selecting the best model. Extensive simulations and real data application demonstrate the advantage the proposed approach in presence of causal variants with opposite directional effects along with a moderate number of null variants in linkage disequilibrium."
