https://openalex.org/W2085053260,"The rotifer Asplanchna releases into its environment a water-soluble, nondialyzable, pronase-sensitive factor which causes uncleaved eggs of another rotifer, Brachionus calyciflorus, to develop into individuals with a pair of long, movable spines which neither their mothers nor the unaffected controls have. These appendages protect the Brachionus from Asplanchna predation."

https://openalex.org/W2003646772,"Aflatoxin B1 binds to both native and denatured DNA, as shown by spectroscopy and equilibrium dialysis. It also strongly inhibits incorporation of cytidine into rat liver nuclear RNA and lowers the RNA content of the nucleus. The extreme toxicity and carcinogenicity of aflatoxin B1 may be direct results of the affinity of this agent for DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2094878552,Although postsynaptic inhibition of Renshaw cells in the spine is blocked by strychnine the depression of these neurons by electrophoretically administered noradrenaline is resistant to this alkaloid. This finding raises doubts as to whether noradrenaline is an inhibitory transmitter in the spinal cord of the cat.
https://openalex.org/W2089539279,"Cutaneous and respiratory evaporation were compared in five species of reptiles at 23 degrees C. There seemed to be a clear correlation between water loss and aridity of the animal's habitat, total evaporation from the desert lizard Sauromalus obesus being about 5 percent of that from the crocodilian Caiman sclerops. Cutaneous evaporation was the major avenue of water loss in all animals examined. This is contrary to the common belief that reptilian skin is practically impermeable to water."
https://openalex.org/W2068135737,"Three groups of hatchling snapping turtles, totaling 20, were fed either meat, fish, or worms. When they were tested for preference after 12 daily feedings, each preferred the diet to which it was accustomed. After 12 more days of eating a different food, each still preferred its original diet. A form of imprinting may be operative in the feeding behavior of this species."
https://openalex.org/W2020663550,"The menmbrane potential of myelinated axons in the resting state shows fluctuations for which the power per cycle of bandwidth is inversely proportional to frequency between I and 10,000 radians per second. Reduction of potassiulm ion flux leads to a decrease in noise power."
https://openalex.org/W2016313455,The probable maximum diving capacities of the Weddell seal were ascertained from observation of 959 dives and measurement of the depths of 381 dives. The deepest dive was 600 meters; the longest submergence was 43 minutes 20 seconds.
https://openalex.org/W2042375386,"In the Chediak-Higashi syndrome, an anomalous hypopigmentation is associated with large lysosomal granules in the blood leukocytes. Since the inheritance pattern is that of an autosomal recessive trait, we postulated a common mechanism for these two primary features of the disease. Electron microscopy of melanocytes revealed that the pigmentary anomaly is indeed based on giant melanosomes. Since both types of granules, leukocytic and melanosomal, are characterized by limiting membranes, Chediak-Higashi disease may be a genetic disease of membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2014314110,"On gel filtration the retention volume of bursicon indicates a molecular weight of about 40,000. On disc electrophoresis bursicon migrates toward the anode and appears at an RF (relative to the marker dye) of 0.3 to 0.4. The properties of fractions with bursicon activity in blood, brain, and ganglion of a fly (Sarcophaga bullata), and in blood, ganglion, and corpora cardiaca of a roach (Periplaneta americana) are similar, but not identical. Bursicon in the blood is more heat labile, and the activity in brain and corpora cardiaca shows two peaks in electrophoresis, instead of one as in the other fractions."
https://openalex.org/W2055054269,"Residues of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-ethane (DDT) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-ethane (DDD) in brains of cowbirds (Molothrus ater) killed by dietary dosage of DDT were similar in birds that died after various lengths of time on dosage and in birds that died of delayed effects after as much as 40 days on clean food. Residues of DDT and DDD, but not of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)-ethylene (DDE), were much lower in survivors 112 days after dosage. The relative importance of DDT and DDD in brains could not be determined, but DDE appeared not to be critical. Residues in brains of cowbirds were similar to those reported for robins, sparrows, eagles, and white rats. Residues in livers and carcass remainders (with the possible exception of DDD in the liver) appeared unsuitable for diagnosing the cause of death."
https://openalex.org/W2062955242,"When red blood cells from 115 sheep were classified for the presence or absence of antigenic factor M and for high (as opposed to low) potassium concentration levels, the cells of the 22 M-negative sheep were low in potassium."
https://openalex.org/W1987485113,"The relative cross-reactivities as judged by tile quantitative precipitation reaction of 22 primate serum albumins were determined with pooled antiserums against human Serum albumnini. The atitgenic correspondences to human serum albumin of all but three serum albumin fell into narrow ranges, and the groups defined by these ranges are distinct taxonomic categories. The values of the cross-reactivity ranges are consistent with the presumed phylogenetic relationships to man on the assumption that the evolutionary modification of protein structure has been progressive and divergent."
https://openalex.org/W1993576324,Previous methods for measuring the range and temporal course of adaptation to thermal stimuli are difficult to use. A technique requiring subjects to adjust the temperature of the stimulator to maintain a just-detectable sensation is described. Complete adaptation occurs to temperatures within the range between 28° and 37.5°C in about 25 minutes.
https://openalex.org/W2054415087,"Small amounts of pesticide residues were found in food samples from 18 markets consisting of 82 foods collected from three different geographical areas. The samples were separated into twelve similar classes of foods, made ready to eat, and analyzed by methods capable of detecting small quantities of 50 common pesticide chemicals."

https://openalex.org/W2055007246,"Speckled trout and lake trout contain five forms of lactate dehydrogenase, but a diflerent electrophoretic distribution of isozymes characterizes each species. The hybrid splake, which is produced artificially by fertilizing lake trout eggs with speckled trout sperm, contains nine isozymes. This comnplement of isozymeg In vivo could be produced in vitro by recombination of subunits from tissues of the parent species. In the splake trout, this complement is the result of heterozygosity at the gene locus responsible for synthesis of LDH-5. Extracts of trout eyes contain at least two additional forms of LDH which could not be demonstrated in other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2025171734,"The incorporation of radio-active inositol and choline into the cytoplasmzic membranes of inositol-and choline-auxotrophic mnutants of Neuros-pora crassa revealed that the membrane of particles which contain proteases is relatively poor in lecithin and rich in inositol-phospholipid. In mycelia of the mutant requiring inositol, grown in a suboptimum amount of exogenous inositol, the strlctural initegrity of the protease particles is lost, and the bulk of intracellular protease activity is recovered in the soluble fraction of the cell. Death from this kind of inositol deficiency is interpreted as autolysis of the cytoplasm cautsed by free proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2070692740,"Newborns of two congenic strains of mice, in which the incidence of leukemia is low, differing only at the weak H-1 locus, were. injected at birth with adult spleen cells of the parent and of the congenic strain. A marked increase in the incidence of lymphoma ensued in those mice of both strains injected with cells from the other strain. The experiment lends some support to the idea that transplantation immunologic mechanisms may play a role in the genesis of lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W2043102609,Examination of the lipids of three species of nonphotosynthetic bacteria with extensive internal membranes revealed phosphatidyl choline (lecithin) in two species. In one of these there was an unusual accumulation of phosphatidyl N-dimethylethanolamine. (The relation between lecithin and membrane elaboration in microorganisms is discussed.)

Chemical studies of this abnormal hemoglobin, designated Hb A2 δ Sphakiá, indicates a substitution of the histidyl residue number two of the δ-chain by an arginyl residue."
https://openalex.org/W1976175697,"The stick insect, Anisomorpha buprestoides, and the catmint, Nepeta cataria, produce closely related cyclopentanoid terpenes, anisomorphal and nepetalactone. Tracer experiments with isotopes indicate that anisomorphal is synthesized by the walking stick from normal terpene precursors (acetate or mevalonate). In the catmint plant, isolated leaf disks synthesized nepetalactone, utilizing the same precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1989765110,"Organ cultures of lymph nodes obtained from nonimmunized rabbits were incubated with bacteriophage d, X174; as a result, 19S antibody was produced first, and then 7S antibody. Differences between this response and the secondary response to d? X174 induced in vitro suggest that the foriiier is a primary response."
https://openalex.org/W2002815046,"Epochs of dreaming sleep, as measured by rapid eye movements, consistently correlated with biphasic change in urine volume and osmolality in catheterized human subjects. Marked decrease in volumne and increase in oslnolality were followed by a hypotonic diuresis."
https://openalex.org/W2058937581,"Tetraethylammonium chloride, which is believed to decrease potassium conductance, and tetrodotoxin, which apparently decreases sodium conductance in nerve fibers, were introduced iontophoretically into the organ of Corti or the scala media of guinea pig cochlea. The former depressed the direct-current endocochlear potential and also the alternating-current cochlear microphonics (the receptor potential of the ear), but tetrodotoxin was ineffective except on the nerve impulses."
https://openalex.org/W2027281999,Examination of the synaptic membranes in calyciform endings of the chick ciliary ganglion has shown tight junctions selectively located on axon hillocks of postsynaptic neurons. Observations of similar membrane fusion in other junctions that involve electrotonic transmission suggest the possibility of identifying electrotonic junctions by electron microscopy.
https://openalex.org/W2044752914,The number of hemoglobins found in individual mature larvae of several Chironomus species is six to nine. The consistency of this number and of the electrophoretic mobilities of these separable forms seems to indicate the synchronous production of polypeptide chains by several genetic loci.
https://openalex.org/W2009326468,"When thymine in dilute, deaerated, aqueous solution was irradiated with gamma-rays in the presence of ethanol, a high yield of products containing both the thymine and ethanol moieties was obtained. These were shown to be isomers formed by the attack of CH(3)CHOH radicals at the carbon No. 6 position of thymine. A similar reaction was observed with N, N'-dimethylthymine, but O,O'-dimethylthymine did not react. The reaction may be relevant to the resistance of certain cells to ionizing radiation."

https://openalex.org/W2069288751,"Cylindrical bodies in renal interstitial cells of dehydrated rats are confluent with membranes of endoplasmic reticulum. The cylinder walls, composed of helically arranged pentagonal tubules, may represent a molecular rearrangement of the membrane structure. The cylinders may represent a morphologic expression of altered ergastoplasmic function possibly related to the production of concentrated urine."
https://openalex.org/W1978502090,Human plasma contains an antibody which produces a complement-linked lysis of chicken erythrocytes and an associated marked stimulation of the cells' aerobic glycolysis. This appears to account for reported alteration in chicken erythrocyte metabolism produced by the plasmas of some schizophrenic patients.
https://openalex.org/W1998652117,"In theory, populations of animals can be displaced by overloading a resource with introduced sterile animals. The theory was tested on natural populations of the Queensland fruitfly Dacus tryoni Frogg. Three of four treated populations declined sharply within 2 days after sterile flies had been introduced. This procedure may be useful both as a tool in experimental ecology and as a means of controlling pests."
https://openalex.org/W2027793295,"Bradykinin, a known smooth-muscle stimulant, affects ureteral peristalsis in the dog; the changes were judged by cinefluorography, peristaltic pressures, and ureteral perfusions. No effect on urine flow was detected. Experiments with rats also demonstrated the effect of the drug on the ureter."
https://openalex.org/W1989302418,"Eyes removed from frog embryos at various stages of development gave a definite pattern of change in the electroretinogram. From the 7th to 9th days the electroretinogram consisted of slow, purely cornea-negative potentials. From the 9th to 10th days the responses were negative but included a prominent fast, negative component superimposed on the slow potentials. During the 11th to 17th days positive potentials appeared and developed. From the 20th day on, the typical electroretinogram of the adult obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2052090056,"Voltage-clamped giant axons of squid, internally perfused with potassium chloride solutions, showed reduced initial transient membrane conductance to voltage and increased overall (leakage) conductance. Unclamped axons showed reduced action and resting potentials. Ionic conductances and membrane potentials were maintained or restored by perfusion with potassium fluoride solutions. As much as 90 percent of internal fluoride could be replaced with chloride without alteration of normal properties of membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2020789302,"Bound methotrexate has been revealed by an autoradiographic procedure, presumed to introduce a method for cytochemical study of folate reductase. Preferential localization is seen in kidney proximal tubules, intestinal epithelium, and nuclei of parenchymal liver cells in mice. The extremely firm binding and prolonged retention of this drug should render it suitable as an inert label for the autoradiographic study of cell migrations and lifetimes."

https://openalex.org/W2091114995,"Study of the precipitation process in the aqueous Sr(OH)(2)-H(3)PO(4) system, in order to elucidate the phase transformations and the nature of the final solid phases, shows that over much of the range of compositions studied the initial precipitate is poorly crystalline; the x-ray pattern resembles that of strontium hydroxyapatite but has a strontium: phosphorus molar ratio close to 1.3. Within 1 hour the initial precipitate changes to a stable crystalline phase (or phases), with corresponding change, either up or down, in the strontium: phosphorus ratio. At high ratios of Sr(OH)(2) to H(2)PO(4) the initial precipitate is Sr(3)(PO(4))(2)-4H(2)O, which then converts to a phase having the x-ray diffraction pattern of strontium hydroxyapatite, but having a strontium: phosphorus ratio that depends somewhat on the initial ratio of Sr(OH)(2) to H(3)PO(4) used in the precipitation."
https://openalex.org/W2025983283,"During barbiturate sleep of rabbits, the succinoxidase activity in isolated neurons and glia from the caudal part of the reticular formation was lower than that during physiological sleep. No rhythmical, inverse enzyme changes were detected in barbiturate sleep in the neuron-glia unit, such as were found in physiological sleep."
https://openalex.org/W1974462564,X-ray studies of crystalline deamino-oxytocin (1-beta-mercaptopropionic acid-oxytocin) have established the existence of both wet and dry forms. A remarkable degree of similarity exists between the two forms even though there are changes in cell dimensions and space group on drying. The dry form of 1-gamma-mercaptobutyric acid-oxytocin is very similar to that of deamino-oxytocin.
https://openalex.org/W1998314249,"Hair samples from the horse, elk, deer, moose, and antelope; subcutaneous tissue from the moose and antelope; and cast and living skin of the rattlesnake were activated by exposure to a neutron flux.

https://openalex.org/W2063910273,"The spleen and thymus of 6-week-old mice contain similar numbers of lymphoid cells. A lethal dose of x-irradiation given to animials whose thymus, midgut, or hindlimbs were shielded at the same time resulted in permanent acceptance of allografts, while a similar dose given to spleen-shielded mice so irradiated resulted in a normal rejection pattern. The return of immunological competence was related to the state of the lymphoid organs with different types of shielding."
https://openalex.org/W2016456661,A system of symbols for the amino acid residues of proteins and peptides is proposed. The symbols convey immediate meaning in chemical terms and therefore allow rapid recognition of the distribution and frequency of occurrence of the various functional groups. The system is readily adaptable to description of new amino acids and amino acid modifications.
https://openalex.org/W2042893852,"Adult rats that had been raised with a minimum of stimulation were injected with thiosemicarbazide, a drug that lowers γ-aminobutyric acid concentrations. Fifteen minutes later the animals were given 30 mild electric shocks over a half-hour period. Two. weeks later they were tested for their resistance to gastric ulceration induced by immobilization. The experimental animals showed a much greater resistance to stress than did the appropriate control groups. A replication confirmed the results of the first study."
https://openalex.org/W2046634341,"The toxic action of 2,4-dinitrophenol on the large cells of the alga, Nitella clavata, was evaluated, with the rate of protoplasmic streaming and the survival time at three light intensities used as criteria. At a sufficiently high intensity the cells survived several weeks, an indication that the energy-uncoupling action of dinitrophenol could be counterbalanced to some extent by an increased energy input. In the treated cells chloroplasts moved from the outer gel-type cytoplasm into the inner, streaming cytoplasm."
