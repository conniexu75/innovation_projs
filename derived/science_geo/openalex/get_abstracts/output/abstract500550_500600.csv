Vertebrate image-forming vision relies on two types of photoreceptors, cones and rods, which capture light using their outer segment, an organelle with a stack of membrane disks that host the photopigments. The light-induced signal travels via an intracellular route, including the connecting cilium, the inner segment, the cell body, the axon, and the axon terminal, before it is transmitted to downstream retinal cells. The connecting cilium is a microtubule-containing structure that is anchored to a basal body derived from a centrosome, and it connects the mitochondria-rich inner segment and the outer segment (Pearring et al., 2013Pearring J.N. Salinas R.Y. Baker S.A. Arshavsky V.Y. Protein sorting, targeting and trafficking in photoreceptor cells.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2013; 36: 24-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The outer segment is dynamically renewed: new membrane folds are added from the end that interfaces the connecting cilium, and old membrane folds are phagocytized by pigment epithelial cells from the other end (Mustafi et al., 2009Mustafi D. Engel A.H. Palczewski K. Structure of cone photoreceptors.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2009; 28: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cones are less sensitive to light than rods and, therefore, operate at higher light intensities, characteristic of daytime, while rods are used during nighttime conditions. In humans, high-resolution daylight vision, which is necessary for reading and for recognizing faces, depends almost entirely on cones. The loss of cone outer segments or their function in adulthood occurs in many photoreceptor diseases and can lead to blindness (Léveillard and Sahel, 2010Léveillard T. Sahel J.-A.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are posttranscriptional repressors of gene expression. Their biogenesis occurs in two steps. The primary RNA transcripts, pri-miRNAs, are cleaved by the Drosha/DGCR8 complex into pre-miRNAs, which are further processed by Dicer to become mature miRNAs (Krol et al., 2010aKrol J. Loedige I. Filipowicz W. The widespread regulation of microRNA biogenesis, function and decay.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar). In animals, the majority of investigated miRNAs base pair imperfectly with messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences in the 3′ UTR, which leads to translational repression, deadenylation, and degradation of target mRNAs. miRNAs function as part of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, miRNPs, with the best-characterized components of miRNPs represented by proteins from the Argonaute (AGO) and GW182 families. The lack of all, or particular, miRNAs during development leads to various defects in the retina (Sundermeier and Palczewski, 2012Sundermeier T.R. Palczewski K.

Matsui R. et al.miR-124a is required for hippocampal axogenesis and retinal cone survival through Lhx2 suppression.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1125-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of Rncr3, the dominant source of miR-124, alters the maturation of cone photoreceptors, which results in increased apoptosis and improper cone migration (Sanuki et al., 2011Sanuki R. Onishi A. Koike C. Muramatsu R. Watanabe S. Muranishi Y. Irie S. Uneo S. Koyasu T.

A transgenic anti-miRNA “sponge” mouse model that reduced the activities of all three miRNAs in the miR-183/96/182 cluster, which is mainly expressed in sensory neurons (Xu et al., 2007Xu S. Witmer P.D. Lumayag S. Kovacs B. Valle D. MicroRNA (miRNA) transcriptome of mouse retina and identification of a sensory organ-specific miRNA cluster.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25053-25066Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), showed increased bright-light-induced retinal degeneration, although neither morphological nor functional differences have been observed under laboratory lighting conditions between transgenic and wild-type mice (Zhu et al., 2011Zhu Q. Sun W. Okano K. Chen Y. Zhang N. Maeda T. Palczewski K. Sponge transgenic mouse model reveals important roles for the microRNA-183 (miR-183)/96/182 cluster in postmitotic photoreceptors of the retina.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 31749-31760Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Characterization of a mouse line in which a gene-trap construct was inserted downstream of the first exon of the miR-183/96/182 gene revealed an almost complete lack of all three miR-183/96/182 cluster miRNAs in the retina. This mouse line showed age-dependent retinal degeneration, as well as increased susceptibility to light damage. Functional defects have been observed at the photoreceptor synapse at 5 weeks of age, while photoreceptor dysfunction was detectable in 6-month-old animals. Analysis of gene expression at times when there was no detectable histological evidence of retinal degeneration identified decreased expression of genes involved in synaptogenesis as well as in cone phototransduction (Lumayag et al., 2013Lumayag S. Haldin C.E. Corbett N.J. Wahlin K.J. Cowan C. Turturro S. Larsen P.E. Kovacs B. Witmer P.D. Valle D. et al.Inactivation of the microRNA-183/96/182 cluster results in syndromic retinal degeneration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E507-E516Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Another study (Jin et al., 2009Jin Z.-B. Hirokawa G. Gui L. Takahashi R. Osakada F. Hiura Y. Takahashi M. Yasuhara O. Iwai N. Targeted deletion of miR-182, an abundant retinal microRNA.Mol. Vis. 2009; 15: 523-533PubMed Google Scholar) did not find any obvious defect in mice with a knockout of only miR-182, possibly because of developmental compensation since miR-182 and miR-183 have similar seed sequences. So far, all studies relating the effects of specific miRNAs to retinal structure and function have been performed in animal models in which genetic manipulation has led to miRNA changes during both development and adulthood. Many of these studies, which have been performed cell-type-nonspecifically, concluded that the developmental loss of specific miRNAs leads to photoreceptor degeneration. How miRNAs contribute to the function of adult cones is not understood. To address this question, we developed a mouse model in which miRNA depletion occurs specifically in cones, after the full development of the retina. We used this model to dynamically follow the subcellular structure, function, and transcriptome of cones. We found that the depletion of miRNAs in adult cones led to two major changes. First, the cone outer segments were lost and, therefore, the light responses of cones were significantly reduced. The loss of the outer segments occurred gradually over a 1-month period. However, cones did not degenerate, the number of cone cell bodies did not change when most of the outer segments were lost, and apoptotic markers did not increase. Importantly, the reexpression of the sensory-cell-specific miR-182 and miR-183 in cones prevented outer segment loss. Second, the genetic identity of cones, quantified by the expression of cone-specific genes, decreased significantly after miRNA depletion. Furthermore, we found that miRNAs of the miR-183/96/182 cluster accelerated the formation of photoreceptor distal structures, such as the inner segments and connecting cilia, in embryonic stem (ES)-cell-derived retinal cultures. Remarkably, in ES-cell-derived cultures, these miRNAs also induced the formation of short outer segments that contained a stack of membrane disks, which are characteristic structures of outer segments in normal photoreceptors. The miRNA-transduced photoreceptors of ES-cell-derived cultures responded to light with the same response polarity, i.e., hyperpolarization, as normal photoreceptors. Our findings suggest that miR-183/96/182 cluster miRNAs regulate the supply of molecular components to the apical membranes of photoreceptors in order to control the maintenance of outer segments. To deplete miRNAs from adult cones, we genetically disrupted the Drosha/DGCR8 miRNA-processing machinery by crossing mice with conditional null Dgcr8 alleles (Yi et al., 2009Yi R. Pasolli H.A. Landthaler M. Hafner M. Ojo T. Sheridan R. Sander C. O’Carroll D. Stoffel M. Tuschl T. Fuchs E. DGCR8-dependent microRNA biogenesis is essential for skin development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and mice expressing Cre recombinase postnatally specifically in cones (D4-Cre; Le et al., 2004Le Y.-Z. Ash J.D. Al-Ubaidi M.R. Chen Y. Ma J.-X. Anderson R.E. Targeted expression of Cre recombinase to cone photoreceptors in transgenic mice.Mol. Vis. 2004; 10: 1011-1018PubMed Google Scholar). We call the mouse line that is homozygous for the conditional null Dgcr8 allele and heterozygous for the Cre allele C-DGCR-KO. The morphology of cones in the C-DGCR-KO mice was revealed by crossing it with the reporter mouse line (Ai9; Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L. Zwingman T.A. Sunkin S.M. Oh S.W. Zariwala H.A. Gu H. Ng L.L. Palmiter R.D. Hawrylycz M.J. Jones A.R. et al.A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3848) Google Scholar) conditionally expressing fluorescent tdTomato protein. D4-Cre mice or D4-Cre mice crossed with Ai9 mice, served as “wild-type” controls. We expressed various genes specifically in C-DGCR-KO or wild-type cones by infection with conditional adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs). Cones were examined in retinal sections, in retinal whole mounts, and in isolation after fluorescence-activated cell sorting. We detected Cre expression earliest at postnatal day 6 (P6) (Figure S1A available online). However, at P30, a time when the retina is fully developed, immunohistochemistry revealed no appreciable difference in DGCR8 signal between C-DGCR-KO and wild-type cone nuclei (Figures S1B–S1D). Quantitative western blot analysis of isolated cones showed 43% DGCR8 levels compared to wild-type (Figure 1A), but the levels of mature miRNAs decreased by only 20%–25% (Figure 1B). The slow depletion of DGCR8 protein (and consequently the miRNAs) is likely due to its high stability. DGCR8 stability is known to be modulated by its phosphorylation and interactions with other proteins (Cheng et al., 2014Cheng T.-L. Wang Z. Liao Q. Zhu Y. Zhou W.-H. Xu W. Qiu Z.

At P30, cone morphology and their opsin-labeled (OPN1SW and OPN1MW) outer segment distribution in whole-mount retinas assayed by immunohistochemistry, the opsin mRNA and protein levels in isolated cones tested by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blot, and cone function tested in vivo using electroretinography were similar in C-DGCR-KO and wild-type mice (Figures 1C–1H and S1E–S1H). The observation that adult cones of C-DGCR-KO mice at P30 had nearly normal mature miRNA levels (Figure 1B), as well as normal structure and function (Figures 1 and S1), indicated a proper development and functional maturation of cone photoreceptors and allowed us to investigate the effect of progressive loss of mature miRNAs in adult cones. In contrast to P30, DGCR8 immunostaining in cone nuclei was not detectable on retinal sections at P60 (Figure S1B) and amounted to only 18% of wild-type levels in a western blot analysis of isolated cones (Figure 1I). Moreover, miRNA levels in isolated P60 C-DGCR-KO cones, tested by qPCR, were 95% lower than in wild-type cones (Figure 1J; see also below). Hence, at P60 the DGCR8 function was largely lost and, consequently, miRNAs were depleted from cones. Importantly, in this miRNA-depleted cone state, we found that the number of cone outer segments labeled with cone opsins was reduced by 90% (Figures 1K–1M). Opsin mRNA and protein expression in isolated cones were also markedly reduced (Figures 1M, 1N, and S1F). Since the number of cones counted in whole-mount retinas was similar in C-DGCR-KO and wild-type mice (Figures S1G and S1H), the loss of opsin staining was not due to the death of cones. Outer segments and opsin expression are important for light detection. We therefore tested the ability of the P60 C-DGCR-KO retina to respond to light stimuli in vivo and ex vivo. In vivo, cone-mediated photoresponses were significantly reduced compared to wild-type and P30 C-DGCR-KO retinas (Figures 1O and 1P). Similar to in vivo recordings, ex vivo single ganglion cell responses measured using whole-cell patch clamp at high light levels, reflecting cone vision, were significantly reduced (Figure S1I). Therefore, by P60 the majority of cones from C-DGCR-KO mice had lost their opsin expression and become nonfunctional but had not died. To reveal fine morphological changes in the P60 opsin-less cones, we reconstructed 50 × 50 × 170 μm2 cubes of the outer retina of P30 and P60 C-DGCR-KO and of P60 wild-type mice using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (EM) (Denk and Horstmann, 2004Denk W. Horstmann H. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct three-dimensional tissue nanostructure.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). This allowed us to visualize cones and rods at the ultrastructural level in 3D (Figures 2A and 2B ). Cones could be distinguished from rods based on a number of criteria (Carter-Dawson and LaVail, 1979Carter-Dawson L.D. LaVail M.M. Rods and cones in the mouse retina. I. Structural analysis using light and electron microscopy.J. Comp. Neurol. 1979; 188: 245-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), the most robust being the organization of heterochromatin in the nucleus (Solovei et al., 2009Solovei I. Kreysing M. Lanctôt C. Kösem S. Peichl L. Cremer T. Guck J. Joffe B. Nuclear architecture of rod photoreceptor cells adapts to vision in mammalian evolution.Cell. 2009; 137: 356-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) (Figures S1C, S1D, and S2A–S2C). All P60 C-DGCR-KO cones lacked outer segments (Figures 2B–2D). The diameter of inner segments was larger than in wild-type mice (Figures 2B and 2C), and we detected oversized mitochondria (Figures 2B and S2D). Cone cell bodies and their nuclear organization were intact and did not appear to be different from wild-type (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2C). Cone morphology in P30 C-DGCR-KO mice and rod photoreceptor morphology in both P30 and P60 C-DGCR-KO mice appeared normal (data not shown), with the exception of the enlarged mitochondria in P30 C-DGCR-KO cones (Figure S2C). To determine the time course of outer segment loss, we 3D-reconstructed the outer retina at 10-day intervals between P30 and P60. P30 C-DGCR8-KO cone outer segments had similar length to wild-type, but at subsequent time points they shortened in a linear fashion until they became undetectable at P60 (Figures 2E and 2F). This indicates that DGCR8-dependent pathways are necessary to maintain cone outer segments in adult mice. To test whether the loss of opsin can be prevented when outer segments are shortening, we reintroduced Dgcr8 to P45 C-DGCR-KO cones via conditional AAV-mediated delivery (Figure 3A). At P90, DGCR8 and opsin protein levels in cones were significantly higher in AAV-infected C-DGCR-KO retinas than in uninfected control retinas, and opsin localized to the distal tip of cones (Figures 3B and 3C). Therefore, the reexpression of DGCR8 was sufficient to reinitiate opsin expression and to target this protein to the distal compartments of cones. The lack of DGCR8 could cause defects either through miRNA-dependent or -independent pathways (Macias et al., 2012Macias S. Plass M. Stajuda A. Michlewski G. Eyras E. Cáceres J.F. DGCR8 HITS-CLIP reveals novel functions for the Microprocessor.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 760-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). If the loss of outer segments was due to miRNA deficiency, reexpressing the relevant miRNA in the absence of DGCR8 should prevent the loss. We used next-generation sequencing of RNA from isolated wild-type P60 cones to determine the most highly expressed miRNAs as candidates for controlling outer segment maintenance. We then designed a strategy to express miRNAs in the absence of DGCR8 in vivo. The expression pattern of miRNAs was highly uneven, with a single miRNA, miR-182, representing 64% of all miRNA reads (Figure 3D). Only four other miRNAs were found in more than 1% of reads. Since miR-182 and miR-183 (third most abundant, 4% of reads) are processed (jointly with miR-96) from the same primary transcript and have related seed sequences (Karali et al., 2007Karali M.

Chem. 2007; 282: 25053-25066Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), we expressed these two together. We also expressed miR-124, since a lack of miR-124 during development has been shown to lead to the loss of opsin expression and to cone death (Sanuki et al., 2011Sanuki R. Onishi A. Koike C. Muramatsu R. Watanabe S. Muranishi Y. Irie S. Uneo S. Koyasu T. Matsui R. et al.miR-124a is required for hippocampal axogenesis and retinal cone survival through Lhx2 suppression.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1125-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To bypass the need for Drosha/DGCR8, we generated short hairpin RNAs resembling pre-miRNAs (sh-miRs), which only need Dicer to produce mature miRNA mimics (Figures 3E, S3A, and S3B). We verified that expression of these sh-miRs in HEK293 cells leads to the specific repression of reporter mRNAs bearing miRNA sites (Figures S3C–S3F). Next, using conditional AAVs, we expressed either miR-182/183 or miR-124 mimics specifically in C-DGCR-KO cones at P30. miR-182/183, but not miR-124, mimics prevented the loss of outer segments and cone opsins at P60 (Figures 3F–3H). Expression of miR-182/183 mimics in C-DGCR-KO mice did not increase the level of other tested miRNAs (Figure 3I), indicating that the availability of miR-182/183 was sufficient to maintain outer segments. We investigated whether reexpression of miR-182/183 mimics can rescue outer segment loss and opsin expression in C-DGCR-KO cones. We administered AAVs expressing the miR-182/183 mimics at P60, i.e., after the loss of the outer segments. Inspection of mouse retinas at P90 indicated that outer segments were not restored (Figure S4A). Expression of Argonaute (AGO) proteins is often coregulated with the cellular availability of miRNAs (Martinez and Gregory, 2013Martinez N.J. Gregory R.I. Argonaute2 expression is post-transcriptionally coupled to microRNA abundance.RNA. 2013; 19: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and we found that Argonaute levels were indeed strongly decreased in C-DGCR-KO mice at P60, when cones are depleted of miRNAs (Figure S4B). Since without Argonautes the miRNA mimics could not function, we attempted to regenerate outer segments by AAV-mediated coexpression of both miR-182/183 mimics and AGO2 at P60. Although this manipulation did not restore outer segments, it significantly increased opsin protein levels in the distal part of cones in AAV-infected C-DGCR-KO P90 retinas compared to controls (Figures S4C and S4D). To gain a mechanistic insight into the altered molecular pathways that lead to outer segment loss and decreased opsin expression, we followed the dynamics of changes in miRNA and mRNA expression in cones between P30 and P90. We isolated cones from C-DGCR-KO and wild-type mice at five time points, P30, P40, P50, P60, and P90, and performed miRNA qPCR, next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and mRNA array experiments using RNA obtained from the isolated cones. We first confirmed that the levels of miRNAs gradually decreased in C-DGCR-KO cones, reaching 1%–3% of starting values at P90 (Figure 4A). As expected, the decrease in mature miRNAs was accompanied by an accumulation of respective pri-miRNAs (Figure 4B). Next, we followed mRNA expression in the same time window. Surprisingly, comparing gene expression at P30 and P60 in isolated C-DGCR-KO cones showed that 96.7% (RNA-seq; Figures 5A, S6A, and S6B) or 99.7% (mRNA arrays; Figure S5A) of expressed genes changed less than 2-fold; the vast majority of genes involved in regulation of apoptosis belonged to this category (Figures 5B and S5B). A small set of genes was, however, up- or downregulated more than 2-fold.Figure 5C-DGCR-KO Cones Lose Their Genetic SignatureShow full caption(A) Scatterplot of expression levels comparing isolated C-DGCR-KO P60 with C-DGCR-KO P30 cones as measured by RNA-seq.

https://openalex.org/W2066483255,"The critical role of retinoids (vitamin A and its derivatives) for vision, reproduction, and survival has been well established. Vitamin A is produced from dietary carotenoids such as β-carotene by centric cleavage via the enzyme BCO1. The biochemical and molecular identification of a second structurally related β-carotene metabolizing enzyme, BCO2, has led to a prolonged debate about its relevance in vitamin A biology. While BCO1 cleaves provitamin A carotenoids, BCO2 is more promiscuous and also metabolizes non-provitamin A carotenoids such as zeaxanthin into long-chain apo-carotenoids. Herein we demonstrate, in cell lines, that human BCO2 is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. Different human BCO2 isoforms possess cleavable N-terminal leader sequences critical for mitochondrial import. Subfractionation of murine hepatic mitochondria confirmed the localization of BCO2 to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Studies in BCO2-knockout mice revealed that zeaxanthin accumulates in the inner mitochondrial membrane; in contrast, β-carotene is retained predominantly in the cytoplasm. Thus, we provide evidence for a compartmentalization of carotenoid metabolism that prevents competition between BCO1 and BCO2 for the provitamin and the production of noncanonical β-carotene metabolites.—Palczewski, G., Amengual, J., Hoppel, C.

https://openalex.org/W2150850085,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key mediators in cardiovascular physiology, yet frontline therapies for heart disease target only a small fraction of the cardiac GPCR repertoire. Moreover, there is emerging evidence that GPCRs implicated in taste (Tas1r and Tas2rs) have specific functions beyond the oral cavity. Our recent description of these receptors in heart tissue foreshadows a potential novel role in cardiac cells. In this study, we identified novel agonist ligands for cardiac-Tas2rs to enable the functional investigation of these receptors in heart tissue. Five Tas2rs cloned from heart tissue were screened against a panel of 102 natural or synthetic bitter compounds in a heterologous expression system. We identified agonists for Tas2r108, Tas2r137, and Tas2r143 that were then tested in Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts (from 8-wk-old male C57BL/6 mice). All Tas2r agonists tested exhibited concentration-dependent effects, with agonists for Tas2r108 and Tas2r137, leading to a ~40% decrease in left ventricular developed pressure and an increase in aortic pressure, respectively. These responses were abrogated in the presence of Gα1 and Gβγ inhibitors (pertussis toxin and gallein). This study represents the first demonstration of profound Tas2r agonist-induced, G protein-dependent effects on mouse heart function.—Foster, S. R., Blank, K., See Hoe, L.

https://openalex.org/W2085217282,"Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative bacterium appearing as an opportunistic pathogen in hospital settings. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) contributes to virulence in several pathogenic bacteria by detoxifying reactive oxygen species released in the course of host defense reactions. However, the biological role of SODs in A. baumannii has not yet been elucidated. Here, we inactivated in A. baumannii ATCC 17978 gene A1S_2343, encoding a putative SOD of the Fe-Mn type by transposon insertion, resulting in mutant ATCC 17978 sod2343::Km. The mutation was also introduced in two naturally competent A. baumannii isolates by transformation with chromosomal DNA derived from mutant ATCC 17978 sod2343::Km. We demonstrate that inactivation of sod2343 leads to significant motility defects in all three A. baumannii strains. The mutant strains were more susceptible to oxidative stress compared to their parental strains. Susceptibility to colistin and tetracycline was increased in all mutant strains while susceptibility of the mutants to gentamicin, levofloxacin and imipenem was strain-dependent. In the Galleria mellonella infection model the mutant strains were significantly attenuated. In conclusion, sod2343 plays an important role in motility, resistance to oxidative stress, susceptibility to antibiotics and virulence in A. baumannii."
https://openalex.org/W2028774864,"Weeds are a major constraint to the success of dry-seeded rice (DSR). The main means of managing these in a DSR system is through chemical weed control using herbicides. However, the use of herbicides alone may not be sustainable in the long term. Approaches that aim for high crop competitiveness therefore need to be exploited. One such approach is the use of high rice seeding rates. Experiments were conducted in the aman (wet) seasons of 2012 and 2013 in Bangladesh to evaluate the effect of weed infestation level (partially-weedy and weed-free) and rice seeding rate (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 kg ha(-1)) on weed and crop growth in DSR. Under weed-free conditions, higher crop yields (5.1 and 5.2 t ha(-1) in the 2012 and 2013 seasons, respectively) were obtained at the seeding rate of 40 kg ha(-1) and thereafter, yield decreased slightly beyond 40 kg seed ha(-1). Under partially-weedy conditions, yield increased by 30 to 33% (2.0-2.2 and 2.9-3.2 t ha(-1) in the 2012 and 2013 seasons, respectively) with increase in seeding rate from 20 to 100 kg ha(-1). In the partially-weedy plots, weed biomass decreased by 41-60% and 54-56% at 35 days after sowing and at crop anthesis, respectively, when seeding rate increased from 20 to 100 kg ha(-1). Results from our study suggest that increasing seeding rates in DSR can suppress weed growth and reduce grain yield losses from weed competition."
https://openalex.org/W2043992066,"Background People with personality disorder have reduced life expectancy, yet, within this population, little is known about the clinical predictors of natural and unnatural deaths. We set out to investigate this, using a large cohort of secondary mental health patients with personality disorder. Methods We identified patients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of personality disorder, aged ≥15 years in a large secondary mental healthcare case register. The case register was linked to national mortality tracing. Using Cox regression, we modelled the effect of a number of pre-specified clinical variables on all-cause, natural cause and unnatural cause mortality. Findings 2,440 patients were identified. Eighty-five deaths (3.5% of cohort) occurred over a 5-year observation period, of which over 50% were from natural causes. All-cause mortality was associated with alcohol or drug use (adjusted Hazard Ratio [aHR] 2.3; 95% CI 1.3–4.1), physical illness (aHR 1.9; 95% CI 1.0–3.6), and functional impairment (aHR 1.9; 95% CI 1.0–3.6). Natural cause mortality was associated with mild problems of alcohol or drug use (aHR 3.4; 95% CI 1.5–7.4), and physical illness (aHR 2.4; 95% CI 1.0–5.6). Unnatural cause mortality was associated only with severe alcohol or drug use (aHR 3.1; 95% CI 1.3–7.3). Interpretation Alcohol and drug use, physical illness, and functional impairment are predictors of mortality in individuals with personality disorder. Clinicians should be aware of the existence of problems in these domains, even at mild levels, when assessing the needs of patients with personality disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2064195202,"Endocrine active substances (EAS) show structural similarities to natural hormones and are suspected to affect the human endocrine system by inducing hormone dependent effects. Recent studies with in vitro tests suggest that EAS can leach from packaging into food and may therefore pose a risk to human health. Sample migrates from food contact materials were tested for estrogen and androgen agonists and antagonists with different commonly used in vitro tests. Additionally, chemical trace analysis by GC-MS and HPLC-MS was used to identify potential hormone active substances in sample migrates. A GC-MS method to screen migrates for 29 known or potential endocrine active substances was established and validated. Samples were migrated according to EC 10/2011, concentrated by solid phase extraction and tested with estrogen and androgen responsive reporter gene assays based on yeast cells (YES and YAS) or human osteoblast cells (ERα and AR CALUX). A high level of agreement between the different bioassays could be observed by screening for estrogen agonists. Four out of 18 samples tested showed an estrogen activity in a similar range in both, YES and ERα CALUX. Two more samples tested positive in ERα CALUX due to the lower limits of detection in this assay. Androgen agonists could not be detected in any of the tested samples, neither with YAS nor with AR CALUX. When testing for antagonists, significant differences between yeast and human cell-based bioassays were noticed. Using YES and YAS many samples showed a strong antagonistic activity which was not observed using human cell-based CALUX assays. By GC-MS, some known or supposed EAS were identified in sample migrates that showed a biological activity in the in vitro tests. However, no firm conclusions about the sources of the observed hormone activity could be obtained from the chemical results."
https://openalex.org/W2082506313,"Background Mortality in hospitalized, febrile patients in Sub-Saharan Africa is high due to HIV-infected, severely immunosuppressed patients with opportunistic co-infection, particularly disseminated tuberculosis (TB) and cryptococcal disease. We sought to determine if a positive lateral flow assay (LFA) result for urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and cryptococcal antigenuria was associated with mortality. Methods 351 hospitalized, HIV-positive adults with symptoms consistent with TB and who were able to provide both urine and sputum specimens were prospectively enrolled at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Uganda as part of a prospective accuracy evaluation of the lateral flow Determine TB LAM test. Stored frozen urine was retrospectively tested for cryptococcal antigen (CRAG) using the LFA. We fitted a multinomial logistic regression model to analyze factors associated with death within 2 months after initial presentation. Results The median CD4 of the participants was 57 (IQR: 14–179) cells/µl and 41% (145) were microbiologically confirmed TB cases. LAM LFA was positive in 38% (134), 7% (25) were CRAG positive, and 43% (151) were positive for either test in urine. Overall, 21% (75) died within the first 2 months, and a total of 32% (114) were confirmed dead by 6 months. At 2 months, 30% of LAM or CRAG positive patients were confirmed dead compared to 15.0% of those who were negative. In an adjusted model, LAM or CRAG positive results were associated with an increased risk of death (RRR 2.29, 95% CI: 1.29, 4.05; P = 0.005). Conclusions In hospitalized HIV-infected patients, LAM or CRAG LFA positivity was associated with subsequent death within 2 months. Further studies are warranted to examine the impact of POC diagnostic ‘test and treat’ approach on patient-centered outcomes."

While most current analyses focus on static networks, the detection of communities in dynamic data is both challenging and timely. An analysis and visualisation procedure for dynamic networks is presented here, which identifies communities and sub-communities that persist across multiple network snapshots. An existing method for community detection in dynamic networks is adapted, extended, and implemented. We demonstrate the applicability of this method to detect communities in networks where individuals tend not to change their community affiliation very frequently. When stability of communities cannot be assumed, we show that the sub-community model may be a better alternative. This is illustrated through test cases of social and biological networks.

https://openalex.org/W2031379341,"Freshwater macroalgae represent a largely overlooked group of phototrophic organisms that could play an important role within an industrial ecology context in both utilising waste nutrients and water and supplying biomass for animal feeds and renewable chemicals and fuels. This study used water from the intensive aquaculture of freshwater fish (Barramundi) to examine how the biomass production rate and protein content of the freshwater macroalga Oedogonium responds to increasing the flux of nutrients and carbon, by either increasing water exchange rates or through the addition of supplementary nitrogen and CO2. Biomass production rates were highest at low flow rates (0.1-1 vol.day-1) using raw pond water. The addition of CO2 to cultures increased biomass production rates by between 2 and 25% with this effect strongest at low water exchange rates. Paradoxically, the addition of nitrogen to cultures decreased productivity, especially at low water exchange rates. The optimal culture of Oedogonium occurred at flow rates of between 0.5-1 vol.day-1, where uptake rates peaked at 1.09 g.m-2.day-1 for nitrogen and 0.13 g.m-2.day-1 for phosphorous. At these flow rates Oedogonium biomass had uptake efficiencies of 75.2% for nitrogen and 22.1% for phosphorous. In this study a nitrogen flux of 1.45 g.m-2.day-1 and a phosphorous flux of 0.6 g.m-2.day-1 was the minimum required to maintain the growth of Oedogonium at 16-17 g DW.m-2.day-1 and a crude protein content of 25%. A simple model of minimum inputs shows that for every gram of dry weight biomass production (g DW.m-2.day-1), Oedogonium requires 0.09 g.m-2.day-1 of nitrogen and 0.04 g.m-2.day-1 of phosphorous to maintain growth without nutrient limitation whilst simultaneously maintaining a high-nutrient uptake rate and efficiency. As such the integrated culture of freshwater macroalgae with aquaculture for the purposes of nutrient recovery is a feasible solution for the bioremediation of wastewater and the supply of a protein resource."

Of these, 4,424 (i.e. 89%) are bacterial genes, including several Pseudomonads that have been shown to use P3N as growth substrate. Here, we have cloned and expressed the gene pa4202 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, purified the resulting protein, and characterized it. The enzyme is active on P3N and other alkyl nitronates, but cannot oxidize nitroalkanes. P3N is the best substrate at pH 7.5 and atmospheric oxygen with k(cat)(app)/K(m)(app) of 12 × 10(6) M(-1) s(-1), k(cat)(app) of 1300 s(-1), and K(m)(app) of 110 μm. Anerobic reduction of the enzyme with P3N yields a flavosemiquinone, which is formed within 7.5 ms, consistent with this species being a catalytic intermediate. Absorption spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and x-ray crystallography demonstrate a tightly, non-covalently bound FMN in the active site of the enzyme. Thus, PA4202 is the first NMO identified and characterized in bacteria. The x-ray crystal structure of the enzyme was solved at 1.44 Å, showing a TIM barrel-fold. Four motifs in common with the biochemically characterized NMO from Cyberlindnera saturnus are identified in the structure of bacterial NMO, defining Class I NMO, which includes bacterial, fungal, and two animal NMOs. Notably, the only other NMO from Neurospora crassa for which biochemical evidence is available lacks the four motifs, defining Class II NMO."
https://openalex.org/W2062055610,"Systemic iron balance is controlled by the liver peptide hormone hepcidin, which is transcriptionally regulated by the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-SMAD pathway. In iron deficiency, liver BMP-SMAD signaling and hepcidin are suppressed as a compensatory mechanism to increase iron availability. MicroRNAs are small regulatory RNAs that have an increasingly recognized role in many biologic processes but are only recently implicated in iron homeostasis regulation. Here, we demonstrate that liver expression of the microRNA miR-130a is up-regulated by iron deficiency in mice. We identify the BMP6-SMAD signaling pathway as a functional target of miR-130a in hepatoma-derived Hep3B cells. Although the TGF-β/BMP common mediator SMAD4 was previously reported to be an miR-130a target to inhibit TGF-β signaling, we do not confirm SMAD4 as an miR-130a target in our biologic system. Instead, we determine that the BMP type I receptor ALK2 is a novel target of miR-130a and that miR-130a binds to two specific sites in the 3'-untranslated region to reduce ALK2 mRNA stability. Moreover, we show in mice that the increased liver miR-130a during iron deficiency is associated with reduced liver Alk2 mRNA levels. Finally, we demonstrate that down-regulation of ALK2 by miR-130a has a functional effect to inhibit BMP6-induced hepcidin transcription in Hep3B cells. Our data suggest that iron deficiency increases liver miR-130a, which, by targeting ALK2, may contribute to reduce BMP-SMAD signaling, suppress hepcidin synthesis, and thereby promote iron availability."

By artificial oligomerization of RAGE alone or RAGE-DAP10, we found that RAGE-DAP10 heterodimer formation resulted in a marked enhancement of Akt activation, whereas homomultimeric interaction of RAGE led to activation of caspase 8. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes exposed to S100A8/A9, a ligand for RAGE, at a nanomolar concentration mimicked the pro-survival response of RAGE-DAP10 interaction, although at a micromolar concentration, the cells mimicked the pro-apoptotic response of RAGE-RAGE.

https://openalex.org/W1979666470,"Mechanical stress regulates development by modulating cell signaling and gene expression. However, the cytoplasmic components mediating mechanotransduction remain unclear. In this study, elimination of muscle contraction during chicken embryonic development resulted in a reduction in the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the cartilaginous growth plate. Inhibition of mTOR activity led to significant inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation, cartilage tissue growth, and expression of chondrogenic genes, including Indian hedgehog (Ihh), a critical mediator of mechanotransduction. Conversely, cyclic loading (1 Hz, 5% matrix deformation) of embryonic chicken growth plate chondrocytes in 3-dimensional (3D) collagen scaffolding induced sustained activation of mTOR. Mechanical activation of mTOR occurred in serum-free medium, indicating that it is independent of growth factor or nutrients. Treatment of chondrocytes with Rapa abolished mechanical activation of cell proliferation and Ihh gene expression. Cyclic loading of chondroprogenitor cells deficient in SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (Shp2) further enhanced mechanical activation of mTOR, cell proliferation, and chondrogenic gene expression. This result suggests that Shp2 is an antagonist of mechanotransduction through inhibition of mTOR activity. Our data demonstrate that mechanical activation of mTOR is necessary for cell proliferation, chondrogenesis, and cartilage growth during bone development, and that mTOR is an essential mechanotransduction component modulated by Shp2 in the cytoplasm."

The positive impacts of seagrass vegetation on zoobenthic abundance and diversity (as compared to bare sands) are well documented, but only in surveys performed in summer, which is the season of maximum canopy development. Here we present the results of the first study of the relationship between the seasonal variability of seagrass vegetation and persistence and magnitude of contrasts in faunal communities between vegetated and bare sediments. The composition, abundance, biomass, and diversity of macrozoobenthos in both habitats were compared five times throughout the year in temperate eelgrass meadows in the southern Baltic Sea. Significant positive effects of macrophyte cover on invertebrate density and biomass were recorded only in June, July, and October when the seagrass canopy was relatively well developed. The effects of vegetation cover on faunal species richness, diversity, and composition persisted throughout the year, but the magnitude of these effects varied seasonally and followed changes in macrophyte biomass. The strongest effects were observed in July and coincided with maximums in seagrass biomass and the diversity and biomass of other macrophytes. These observations indicate that in temperate, clearly seasonal systems the assessment of macrophyte impact cannot be based solely on observations performed in just one season, especially when that season is the one in which macrophyte growth is at its maximum. The widely held belief that macrophyte cover strongly influences benthic fauna in marine coastal habitats, which is based on summer surveys, should be revisited and complemented with information obtained in other seasons."

Our aim was to determine lifestyle and clinical factors that are associated with 25OHD level and to investigate connection of 25OHD level with metabolic and cardiovascular disease markers.In total, 2868 Finnish men and women aged 45-74 years participated in FIN-D2D population-based health survey in 2007. Participants that had a serum sample available (98.4%; n = 2822) were included in this study. 25OHD was measured with chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay method.The mean 25OHD level was 58.2 nmol/l in men (n = 1348) and 57.1 nmol/l in women (n = 1474). Mean 25OHD level was lower in the younger age groups than in the older ones (p<0.0001 both in men and women). This study confirmed that low physical activity (p<0.0001 both in men and women), smoking (p = 0.0002 in men and p = 0.03 in women) and high BMI (p<0.0001 in women) are factors that independently associate with low 25OHD level. Of the metabolic and cardiovascular disease markers high triglyceride concentration (p = 0.02 in men and p = 0.001 in women) and high apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio (p = 0.04 in men and p = 0.03 in women) were independently associated with low 25OHD level.Higher age did not predict lower 25OHD level in this study population of aged 45-74 years which may derive from a healthy life-style of ""active pensioners"". Low physical activity and smoking came up as independent lifestyle factors associated with low 25OHD level. Defining the molecular mechanisms behind the associations of 25OHD with low physical activity and smoking are important objective in future studies. The association of 25OHD with BMI, high triglyceride concentration and apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio may be related to the role of vitamin D in inflammation, but more detailed studies are needed."

Previously, we performed an investigation in the active touch domain and linked several surface properties (i.e. frictional force fluctuations and net friction) with their pleasantness levels. The aim of the present study was to investigate physical factors being important for pleasantness perception during passive fingertip stimulation. Specifically we were interested to see whether factors, such as surfaces' topographies or their frictional characteristics could influence pleasantness. Furthermore, we ascertained how the stimulus pleasantness level was impacted by (i) the normal force of stimulus application (FN) and (ii) the stimulus temperature (TS).The right index fingertips of 22 blindfolded participants were stimulated using 27 different stimuli, which varied in average roughness (Ra) and TS. A 4-axis robot moved the stimuli horizontally under participants' fingertips with three levels of FN. The robot was equipped with force sensors, which recorded the FN and friction force (FT) during stimulation. Participants rated each stimulus according to a three-level pleasantness scale, as very pleasant (scored 0), pleasant (scored 1), or unpleasant (scored 2). These ordinal pleasantness ratings were logarithmically transformed into linear and unidimensional pleasantness measures with the Rasch model. Statistical analyses were conducted to investigate a possible link between the stimulus properties (i.e. Ra, FN, FT, and TS) and their respective pleasantness levels. Only the mean Ra and FT values were negatively correlated with pleasantness. No significant correlation was detected between FN or TS and pleasantness.Pleasantness perception, resulting from passive fingertip stimulation, seems to be influenced by the surfaces' average roughness levels and average FT occurring during fingertip stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2053577886,"In our previous studies, we reported that SIRT1 prevents cellular senescence in human fibroblast, and that SIRT1-induced inhibition of cellular senescence is due to enhanced hTERT gene expression. In this study, we investigate the molecular mechanisms behind SIRT1-induced potentiation of hTERT transcription and show that FOXO3a functions downstream of SIRT1 and prevents the induction of cellular senescence by enhancing hTERT gene expression. Furthermore, we found that FOXO3a-induced potentiation of hTERT gene expression is regulated in a c-MYC/E-box dependent manner. In addition, we found that FOXO3a binds to the novel binding element in the c-MYC promoter, and this interaction activates the transcription of the c-MYC gene. The resulting increase in c-MYC leads to higher levels of c-MYC recruited to the hTERT promoter and, in turn, activates hTERT gene expression. Taken together, this pathway might constitute the molecular basis for the anti-senescence effects of SIRT1 and FOXO3a."
https://openalex.org/W2035043622,"Mitochondria, the major source of cellular energy in the form of ATP, respond to changes in substrate availability and bioenergetic demands by employing rapid, short-term, metabolic adaptation mechanisms, such as phosphorylation-dependent protein regulation. In mammalian cells, an intramitochondrial CO2-adenylyl cyclase (AC)-cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway regulates aerobic energy production. One target of this pathway involves phosphorylation of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit 4-isoform 1 (COX4i1), which modulates COX allosteric regulation by ATP. However, the role of the CO2-sAC-cAMP-PKA signalosome in regulating COX activity and mitochondrial metabolism and its evolutionary conservation remain to be fully established. We show that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, normoxic COX activity measured in the presence of ATP is 55% lower than in the presence of ADP. Moreover, the adenylyl cyclase Cyr1 activity is present in mitochondria, and it contributes to the ATP-mediated regulation of COX through the normoxic subunit Cox5a, homologue of human COX4i1, in a bicarbonate-sensitive manner. Furthermore, we have identified 2 phosphorylation targets in Cox5a (T65 and S43) that modulate its allosteric regulation by ATP. These residues are not conserved in the Cox5b-containing hypoxic enzyme, which is not regulated by ATP. We conclude that across evolution, a CO2-sAC-cAMP-PKA axis regulates normoxic COX activity."
https://openalex.org/W2153490209,"Human trophoblast invasion of decidualized endometrium is essential for placentation and is tightly regulated and involves trophoblast-decidual cell interaction. High temperature requirement A4 (HtrA4) is a secreted serine protease highly expressed in the invasive extravillous trophoblasts that invade decidua. In contrast, both HtrA1 and HtrA3 have been shown to inhibit trophoblast invasion. Here we provide evidence that decidua-secreted HtrA1 and HtrA3 antagonize HtrA4-mediated trophoblast invasion. We demonstrated that HtrA1 and HtrA3 interact with and degrade HtrA4 and thereby inhibit trophoblast-like JAR cell invasion.

Our study reveals a novel regulatory mechanism of trophoblast invasion through physical and functional interaction between HtrA family members. Human trophoblast invasion of decidualized endometrium is essential for placentation and is tightly regulated and involves trophoblast-decidual cell interaction. High temperature requirement A4 (HtrA4) is a secreted serine protease highly expressed in the invasive extravillous trophoblasts that invade decidua. In contrast, both HtrA1 and HtrA3 have been shown to inhibit trophoblast invasion. Here we provide evidence that decidua-secreted HtrA1 and HtrA3 antagonize HtrA4-mediated trophoblast invasion. We demonstrated that HtrA1 and HtrA3 interact with and degrade HtrA4 and thereby inhibit trophoblast-like JAR cell invasion. Specifically, HtrA1 and HtrA3 expression is up-regulated under decidualization conditions in endometrial stromal and epithelial cells, T-HESCs and Ishikawa cells, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2051064479,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), including host miRNAs and viral miRNAs, play vital roles in regulating host-virus interactions. DNA viruses encode miRNAs that regulate the viral life cycle. However, it is generally believed that cytoplasmic RNA viruses do not encode miRNAs, owing to inaccessible cellular miRNA processing machinery. Here, we provide a comprehensive genome-wide analysis and identification of miRNAs that were derived from hepatitis A virus (HAV; Hu/ China/H2/1982), which is a typical cytoplasmic RNA virus. Using deep-sequencing and in silico approaches, we identified 2 novel virally encoded miRNAs, named hav-miR-1-5p and hav-miR-2-5p. Both of the novel virally encoded miRNAs were clearly detected in infected cells. Analysis of Dicer enzyme silencing demonstrated that HAV-derived miRNA biogenesis is Dicer dependent. Furthermore, we confirmed that HAV mature miRNAs were generated from viral miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) in host cells. Notably, naturally derived HAV miRNAs were biologically and functionally active and induced post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Genomic location analysis revealed novel miRNAs located in the coding region of the viral genome. Overall, our results show that HAV naturally generates functional miRNA-like small regulatory RNAs during infection. This is the first report of miRNAs derived from the coding region of genomic RNA of a cytoplasmic RNA virus. These observations demonstrate that a cytoplasmic RNA virus can naturally generate functional miRNAs, as DNA viruses do. These findings also contribute to improved understanding of host-RNA virus interactions mediated by RNA virus-derived miRNAs.—Shi, J., Sun, J., Wang, B., Wu, M., Zhang, J., Duan, Z., Wang, H., Hu, N., Hu, Y., Novel microRNA-like viral small regulatory RNAs arising during human hepatitis A virus infection.

https://openalex.org/W2076395671,"Livestock-associated MRSA (MC398) has emerged and is related to an extensive reservoir in pigs and veal calves. Individuals with direct contact with these animals and their family members are known to have high MC398 carriage rates. Until now it was assumed that MC398 does not spread to individuals in the community without pig or veal calf exposure. To test this, we identified the proportion of MC398 in MRSA positive individuals without contact with pigs/veal calves or other known risk factors (MRSA of unknown origin; MUO).In 17 participating hospitals, we determined during two years the occurrence of MC398 in individuals without direct contact with livestock and no other known risk factor (n = 271) and tested in a post analysis the hypothesis whether hospitals in pig-dense areas have higher proportions of MC398 of all MUO.Fifty-six individuals (20.7%) without animal contact carried MC398. In hospitals with high pig-densities in the adherence area, the proportion of MC398 of all MUO was higher than this proportion in hospitals without pigs in the surroundings.One fifth of the individuals carrying MUO carried MC398. So, MC398 is found in individuals without contact to pigs or veal calves. The way of transmission from the animal reservoir to these individuals is unclear, probably by human-to-human transmission or by exposure to the surroundings of the stables. Further research is needed to investigate the way of transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1966248956,"Trophically-transmitted parasites often change the phenotype of their intermediate hosts in ways that increase their vulnerability to definitive hosts, hence favouring transmission. As a ""collateral damage"", manipulated hosts can also become easy prey for non-host predators that are dead ends for the parasite, and which are supposed to play no role in transmission strategies. Interestingly, infection with the acanthocephalan parasite Polymorphus minutus has been shown to reduce the vulnerability of its gammarid intermediate hosts to non-host predators, whose presence triggered the behavioural alterations expected to favour trophic transmission to bird definitive hosts. Whilst the behavioural response of infected gammarids to the presence of definitive hosts remains to be investigated, this suggests that trophic transmission might be promoted by non-host predation risk. We conducted microcosm experiments to test whether the behaviour of P. minutus-infected gammarids was specific to the type of predator (i.e. mallard as definitive host and fish as non-host), and mesocosm experiments to test whether trophic transmission to bird hosts was influenced by non-host predation risk. Based on the behaviours we investigated (predator avoidance, activity, geotaxis, conspecific attraction), we found no evidence for a specific fine-tuned response in infected gammarids, which behaved similarly whatever the type of predator (mallard or fish). During predation tests, fish predation risk did not influence the differential predation of mallards that over-consumed infected gammarids compared to uninfected individuals. Overall, our results bring support for a less sophisticated scenario of manipulation than previously expected, combining chronic behavioural alterations with phasic behavioural alterations triggered by the chemical and physical cues coming from any type of predator. Given the wide dispersal range of waterbirds (the definitive hosts of P. minutus), such a manipulation whose efficiency does not depend on the biotic context is likely to facilitate its trophic transmission in a wide range of aquatic environments."

We show that voltage-gated channels activated during subthreshold glutamatergic synaptic potentials in a principal cell generate an excitatory→inhibitory synaptic sequence that excites electrically coupled interneurons.

How subthreshold depolarizations propagate through electrical networks, and whether they represent a physiologically relevant signal, is unclear. In the cerebellum-like dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), granule cell parallel fibers relaying sensory information form sparse excitatory synapses with projection neurons (fusiform cells) and inhibitory molecular layer interneurons. This organization implies that neighboring cells are activated by different sets of parallel fibers and that local inhibition is not recruited in a traditional “feedforward” manner (Roberts and Trussell, 2010Roberts M.T. Trussell L.O. Molecular layer inhibitory interneurons provide feedforward and lateral inhibition in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 2462-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, fusiform cells are electrically coupled to small, high-impedance GABAergic interneurons (stellate cells; Apostolides and Trussell, 2013Apostolides P.F. Trussell L.O. Regulation of interneuron excitability by gap junction coupling with principal cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1764-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, Apostolides and Trussell, 2014Apostolides P.F. Trussell L.O. Chemical synaptic transmission onto superficial stellate cells of the mouse dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2014; 111: 1812-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Do subthreshold synaptic inputs in fusiform cells excite stellate cells? If so, this would allow the lateral activation of stellate cells across divergent parallel fibers, ensuring recruitment of local inhibition despite sparse convergence from excitatory synapses. Using patch-clamp recordings in acute slices of mouse DCN, we show that parallel fiber synapses onto fusiform cells activate a long-lasting Na+ conductance at subthreshold voltages and deactivate a hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN or Ih) conductance. Transmission of this synaptic and voltage-gated waveform through electrical synapses profoundly alters the time course and amplitude of excitatory transmission onto stellate cells and drives spikes in an inhibitory network. Stellate and fusiform cells receive excitatory synapses from parallel fibers in the DCN molecular layer (Figure 1A) (Wouterlood et al., 1984Wouterlood F.G. Mugnaini E. Osen K.K. Dahl A.L. Stellate neurons in rat dorsal cochlear nucleus studies with combined Golgi impregnation and electron microscopy: synaptic connections and mutual coupling by gap junctions.J. Neurocytol. 1984; 13: 639-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In stellate cells voltage-clamped at −67 mV, single shocks to parallel fibers (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online) caused a multiphasic response with an early inward and a late outward component (Figure 1B). The outward component was not due to glycine or GABAA receptors, as all experiments were performed in the presence of strychnine (1–2 μM) and SR95531 (10 μM). Interestingly, NBQX (10 μM) abolished both inward and outward components (n = 7), indicating that AMPA receptor activation triggered excitatory and inhibitory responses (Figure 1B, red trace). Close inspection of the traces revealed trial-to-trial variation in the responses to parallel fiber stimulation. Some events had an initial rapidly rising and decaying inward component that resembled a fast AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) and were followed by the slow inward and outward phases. Other events lacked the initial fast phase, yet maintained identical slow inward and outward components (n = 11) (Figure 1B, right, black and gray traces, respectively). This slow component accounted for 75% ± 7% of the total inward charge transfer. The stimulus intensity was adjusted to evoke initial fast-rising currents in approximately half of the trials; we thus interpret the variable appearance of the fast inward component as reflecting quantal fluctuation of release from single parallel fiber synapses on the recorded stellate cells. Given that AMPA receptors in DCN stellate cells display rapid rise and decay kinetics (Apostolides and Trussell, 2014Apostolides P.F. Trussell L.O. Chemical synaptic transmission onto superficial stellate cells of the mouse dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2014; 111: 1812-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the drastically slower kinetics and comparatively invariant nature of the later components shown in Figure 1B suggest that these “synaptic” currents originate in fusiform cells electrically coupled to the voltage-clamped stellate cell. Accordingly, stellate cell EPSCs recorded in slices from mutant mice lacking electrical coupling in the DCN (Connexin36−/− mice; Cx36−/−) fluctuated between a purely fast inward current and no current at all (n = 12 cells) (Figure 1C). The slow outward component was also absent in Cx36−/− mice, indicating that it similarly originated from prejunctional fusiform cells. The total inward charge transfer of EPSCs from Cx36−/− mice was much smaller than EPSCs of WT mice, suggesting that parallel fiber inputs passing through fusiform cells represent the majority of synaptic excitation for stellate cells in WT mice under these stimulus conditions (Figure 1D, left panel). However, the charge and peak amplitude of the fast AMPA component (representing parallel fiber transmission directly onto the voltage-clamped stellate cell) was similar across genotypes, arguing that these differences were not due to general deficits in parallel fiber transmission in mutant mice (Figure 1D, middle and right panels). In summary, our data show that the majority of excitation in stellate cells is inherited from prejunctional fusiform cells during sparse parallel fiber activity. Excitatory synapses can activate Ca2+ and Na+ channels that shape excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) (Stuart and Sakmann, 1995Stuart G. Sakmann B.

Transient sodium current at subthreshold voltages: activation by EPSP waveforms.Neuron. 2012; 75: 1081-1093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Given that fusiform cells express a long-lasting Na+ current that is active at subthreshold voltages (Leao et al., 2012Leao R.M. Li S. Doiron B. Tzounopoulos T. Diverse levels of an inwardly rectifying potassium conductance generate heterogeneous neuronal behavior in a population of dorsal cochlear nucleus pyramidal neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2012; 107: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that subthreshold excitation might activate this current and broaden parallel fiber-fusiform cell EPSPs. If so, the slow inward component observed in stellate cells (Figure 1B) would not merely represent a passive depolarization of fusiform cell dendrites during EPSPs, but rather an active subthreshold depolarization by Na+ currents in prejunctional fusiform cells. We tested whether subthreshold EPSPs activate Na+ channels in fusiform cells by injecting EPSC-like waveforms through the patch pipette and quantifying the effect of the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) (1 μM) on the resulting artificial EPSPs (aEPSPs). Increasing the EPSC waveform amplitude generated progressively larger aEPSPs whose half-widths were markedly dependent on the EPSC waveform amplitude: aEPSPs evoked with 100–200 pA waveforms had significantly smaller half-widths than aEPSPs evoked with 250–700 pA waveforms (Figures 2A and 2B) (44 ± 8 versus 77 ± 14 ms, p = 0.003, paired t test). TTX abolished this amplitude-dependence of aEPSP half-width, and linear fits to the aEPSP peak amplitude values further revealed that Na+ channels control the slope of the excitatory input/output curve (Figure 2B, right panel). The amplitude range of EPSC waveforms in these experiments is similar to that of sound-evoked EPSCs recorded from fusiform cells in vivo (Zhou et al., 2012Zhou M. Tao H.W. Zhang L.I. Generation of intensity selectivity by differential synaptic tuning: fast-saturating excitation but slow-saturating inhibition.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 18068-18078Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous data show that parallel fiber EPSCs <500 pA (corresponding to ∼10 simultaneously active parallel fibers) drive spiking in less than 50% of trials (Roberts and Trussell, 2010Roberts M.T. Trussell L.O. Molecular layer inhibitory interneurons provide feedforward and lateral inhibition in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 2462-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since the mean amplitude of the largest EPSC waveform we used to trigger the Na+ conductance at subthreshold potentials was 471 ± 58 pA, (n = 7), these findings suggest that the majority of naturally occurring parallel fiber activity on fusiform cells that does not drive action potentials would be expected to activate the TTX-sensitive Na+ conductance. Interestingly, an afterhyperpolarization (AHP) often followed the aEPSPs (Figure 2A, asterisk), suggesting that the outward current observed in stellate cells (Figure 1) might also result from subthreshold events in fusiform cells. TTX reduced this AHP to 39% ± 8% of baseline (n = 7 cells), which was likely secondary to an effect of TTX on aEPSP half-width: in three cells tested in TTX, increasing the decay time constant of the EPSC waveform from 3 to 10 ms rescued the original AHP amplitude (baseline amplitude with 3 ms decay: −1.4 ± 0.3 mV; in TTX with 3 ms decay: −0.8 ± 0.2 mV; in TTX with 10 ms decay: −1.6 ± 0.3 mV). Altogether, these data show that Na+ currents activated by subthreshold depolarizations control the size and duration of excitatory signals and predict that Na+ channels located on prejunctional fusiform cells play a major role in shaping transmission in electrically coupled stellate cells. Given that Na+ channels have such a profound effect on aEPSPs, we tested whether subthreshold events in fusiform cells transmit a TTX-sensitive current to stellate cells by recording from electrically coupled fusiform-stellate cell pairs and driving aEPSPs in the fusiform cell while voltage clamping the stellate cell (Figure 2C). The aEPSPs generated time-locked postjunctional inward currents in stellate cells, showing that subthreshold events in fusiform cells are reliably transmitted through gap junctions (n = 6 pairs) (Figure 2C, black trace). TTX significantly reduced the peak amplitude and half-width of aEPSPs in fusiform cells (to 73% ± 3% and 32% ± 5% of baseline, respectively), mirrored by a prominent reduction in peak amplitude and charge transfer of the postjunctional currents in the stellate cell (Figures 2C and 2D). This effect was not due to secondary activation of Na+ channels on stellate cells, as Na+ channels were preblocked in all experiments by the addition of QX314 (5 mM) specifically to the stellate cell internal solution. Thus, subthreshold activation of voltage-gated Na+ channels in single neurons shapes excitatory transmission in a network of neurons. The AHP following aEPSPs (Figure 2A) might represent a synaptic “off-response” that could generate the slow outward current (Figure 1B) and provide long-lasting inhibition to stellate cells following excitatory signals. Interestingly, the half-width of the subthreshold AHPs following aEPSPs (352 ± 24 ms, n = 19 cells) resembled that of the fusiform cell post-spike burst AHP reported in a previous study (406 ± 58 ms; Apostolides and Trussell, 2013Apostolides P.F. Trussell L.O. Regulation of interneuron excitability by gap junction coupling with principal cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1764-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the slow outward current recorded in stellate cells (Figure 1B) also resembled the current mediated by gap junction propagation of the fusiform cell post-spike burst (Apostolides and Trussell, 2013Apostolides P.F. Trussell L.O. Regulation of interneuron excitability by gap junction coupling with principal cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1764-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the same biophysical mechanism might underlie AHPs generated by subthreshold or suprathreshold activity in fusiform cells, and the resulting voltage deflection would generate a net outward current in stellate cells. Given a recent study showing that HCN channels control the resting membrane potential of fusiform cells (Rusznák et al., 2013Rusznák Z. Pál B. Kőszeghy A. Fu Y. Szücs G. Paxinos G. The hyperpolarization-activated non-specific cation current (In ) adjusts the membrane properties, excitability, and activity pattern of the giant cells in the rat dorsal cochlear nucleus.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2013; 37: 876-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that HCN channels could mediate the AHP: because HCN channels activate upon hyperpolarization and deactivate during depolarization, action potentials or subthreshold EPSPs will deactivate the HCN channels that are open at rest, thereby transiently bringing the membrane potential below rest after an excitatory event. The decay kinetics of the AHP would therefore follow the reactivation kinetics of HCN channels. We first evaluated the effect of the HCN channel blocker CsCl (3 mM) on the AHP following aEPSPs in fusiform cells. CsCl hyperpolarized fusiform cells (n = 7 cells; baseline: −70.3 ± 1.4 mV; CsCl: −76 ± 3.4 mV), in agreement with Rusznák et al., 2013Rusznák Z. Pál B. Kőszeghy A. Fu Y. Szücs G. Paxinos G. The hyperpolarization-activated non-specific cation current (In ) adjusts the membrane properties, excitability, and activity pattern of the giant cells in the rat dorsal cochlear nucleus.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2013; 37: 876-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar. Surprisingly, CsCl also caused a concomitant decrease in the fusiform cell’s input resistance, which was largely reversed by returning the membrane potential near its baseline level with bias current (baseline: 93.2 ± 10.8 MOhm; CsCl: 57.2 ± 6.8 MOhm; CsCl + bias current: 88.3 ± 13 MOhm) (p = 0.002, one-way repeated-measures ANOVA + Bonferroni test comparing baseline and CsCl; n.s. comparing baseline and CsCl + bias current; membrane potential in CsCl + bias current condition: −70.0 ± 1.4 mV). The voltage-dependent drop in membrane resistance is likely due to activation of inward rectifier K+ conductance, as described previously (Leao et al., 2012Leao R.M. Li S. Doiron B. Tzounopoulos T. Diverse levels of an inwardly rectifying potassium conductance generate heterogeneous neuronal behavior in a population of dorsal cochlear nucleus pyramidal neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2012; 107: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In agreement with a HCN-mediated mechanism, CsCl blocked the AHP following aEPSPs (n = 7, Figure 3A+inset). Returning the membrane potential back to its original value did not recover the AHP, indicating that this was not due to a shunting effect. Blocking HCN channels is expected to hyperpolarize fusiform cells away from the activation range for Na+ currents that shape subthreshold events (e.g., Figure 2), thereby altering the time course of aEPSPs. Indeed, CsCl reduced the amplitude and half-width of aEPSPs, and this effect was largely reversed by returning the membrane potential to near baseline values (n = 7, Figure 3A). The unusual voltage-dependence of aEPSP half-widths points to a key role for HCN channels in temporal integration through setting the resting membrane potential near the activation range for a Na+ current. Thus, HCN channels in fusiform cells might shape excitation in stellate cells in two ways: basal HCN activity would determine the half-width of slow inward currents in stellate cells by controlling whether parallel fibers onto fusiform cells activate the Na+ conductance, whereas transient deactivation of HCN channels following fusiform cell EPSPs would cause a slow hyperpolarization. Thus, blocking HCN channels should reduce the half-width of inward currents and block the outward currents following parallel fiber stimuli in voltage-clamped stellate cells. Accordingly, CsCl reduced the inward charge transfer of EPSCs and blocked the subsequent outward current in stellate cells (Figure 3B, n = 8), and similar reductions were observed with another HCN channel blocker (ZD7288, 20 μM; n = 4, data not shown). Thus, the interplay between subthreshold activation of Na+ currents, Ih, and gap junctions generates a synaptic excitatory→inhibitory sequence in local interneurons that persists for several hundred milliseconds. Is parallel fiber activity required for HCN-mediated inhibition in stellate cells, or does depolarizing the prejunctional fusiform cells suffice? We distinguished between these two possibilities by testing whether AHPs following spike trains in fusiform cells generate CsCl-sensitive outward currents in stellate cells. Square pulse current injections in fusiform cells drove spike trains followed by a prominent AHP (Figure 3C; see also Apostolides and Trussell, 2013Apostolides P.F. Trussell L.O. Regulation of interneuron excitability by gap junction coupling with principal cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1764-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Bath application of CsCl hyperpolarized fusiform cells, as previously mentioned. We injected positive bias current in CsCl to maintain the cell’s membrane potential near the baseline value (n = 6; pre-CsCl: −73.1 ± 1.8 mV; post CsCl: −73.5 ± 1.0 mV; p = 0.63, paired t test), but the AHP was still reduced to 53% ± 5% of baseline (Figure 3C, n = 6). Thus, HCN channels mediate approximately half of the spike train-triggered AHP in fusiform cells. In mice expressing channelrhodopsin2 specifically in fusiform cells (see Experimental Procedures), light stimuli generate biphasic postjunctional photocurrents in voltage-clamped stellate cells that are due to spike trains in prejunctional fusiform cells (Apostolides and Trussell, 2013Apostolides P.F. Trussell L.O. Regulation of interneuron excitability by gap junction coupling with principal cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1764-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These photocurrents are characterized by a steady state inward component followed by a slow outward component upon light termination. Similar to results with parallel fiber stimuli (Figure 3B), the outward component was strongly reduced by CsCl (n = 7, Figure 3D), thus confirming that depolarizing fusiform cells is sufficient to generate HCN-mediated inhibition in stellate cells. The low-pass filter properties of gap junctions predict that slow events such as EPSPs might be significantly more potent than spikes in regulating the membrane potential of postjunctional cells. Do synaptic events that fail to generate action potentials in fusiform cells nevertheless bring the stellate cell membrane potential above spike threshold? We tested this idea by recording from electrically coupled pairs, evoking aEPSPs in prejunctional fusiform cells, and quantifying the number of spikes per 50 ms bin in postjunctional stellate cells. Fusiform cell aEPSPs caused time-locked spikes in stellate cells in a number of trials (n = 7 pairs, Figures 4A–4D). In some pairs, the stellate cell’s spontaneous firing rate was reduced during the ∼200–400 ms following the aEPSP, corresponding to the timing of the fusiform cell subthreshold AHP. However, this reduction was not statistically significant in grouped data (one-way repeated-measures ANOVA + Dunnett’s test), suggesting that a significant reduction in stellate cell spike rate may require summation of subthreshold events from multiple prejunctional fusiform cells. Thus, subthreshold excitatory events in a single principal neuron can drive spikes in its electrically coupled neighbors, thereby increasing the range of presynaptic parallel fibers which recruit inhibitory interneurons. We have shown that in addition to canonical mechanisms of synaptic transmission, the strength and kinetics of excitatory transmission onto DCN stellate cells are controlled by synapses located on prejunctional fusiform cells. Specifically, parallel fiber synapses trigger an excitatory→inhibitory sequence mediated by the spread of voltage-gated events through gap junctions. Although stellate cells express fast-gating, Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (Apostolides and Trussell, 2014Apostolides P.F. Trussell L.O. Chemical synaptic transmission onto superficial stellate cells of the mouse dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2014; 111: 1812-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the time course of EPSCs can be surprisingly slow (Figure 1). We find that a Na+ current activated by subthreshold EPSPs in fusiform cells accounts for this paradox. Furthermore, a hyperpolarization following deactivation of the resting HCN conductance in fusiform cells caused a net outward current in stellate cells, highlighting a biophysical mechanism by which excitatory synapses generate complex synaptic excitatory→inhibitory sequences. More generally, our data reveal a functional architecture that dramatically increases a neuron’s total number of presynaptic inputs in a manner not expected from the established anatomical circuit. Thus, these data reveal an anatomical and biophysical setting in which subthreshold activity in prejunctional neurons drives the suprathreshold activity of postjunctional neurons. Electrical coupling, HCN channels, and subthreshold activation of TTX-sensitive Na+ channels are all common features of neurons found in diverse brain regions (Christie et al., 1989Christie M.J.

https://openalex.org/W1983521560,"In Escherichia coli, FtsK is a large integral membrane protein that coordinates chromosome segregation and cell division. The N-terminal domain of FtsK (FtsKN) is essential for division, and the C terminus (FtsKC) is a well characterized DNA translocase. Although the function of FtsKN is unknown, it is suggested that FtsK acts as a checkpoint to ensure DNA is properly segregated before septation. This may occur through modulation of protein interactions between FtsKN and other division proteins in both the periplasm and cytoplasm; thus, a clear understanding of how FtsKN is positioned in the membrane is required to characterize these interactions. The membrane topology of FtsKN was initially determined using site-directed reporter fusions; however, questions regarding this topology persist. Here, we report a revised membrane topology generated by site-directed fluorescence labeling. The revised topology confirms the presence of four transmembrane segments and reveals a newly identified periplasmic loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains. Within this loop, four residues were identified that, when mutated, resulted in the appearance of cellular voids. High resolution transmission electron microscopy of these voids showed asymmetric division of the cytoplasm in the absence of outer membrane invagination or visible cell wall ingrowth. This uncoupling reveals a novel role for FtsK in linking cell envelope septation events and yields further evidence for FtsK as a critical checkpoint of cell division. The revised topology of FtsKN also provides an important platform for future studies on essential interactions required for this process."

Tomosyn proteins are negative regulators of exocytosis. Tomosyn causes an attenuation of insulin secretion by limiting the formation of the SNARE complex. We hypothesized that glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion from β-cells must involve reversing the inhibitory action of tomosyn. Here, we show that glucose increases tomosyn protein turnover. Within 1 h of exposure to 15 mm glucose, ∼50% of tomosyn was degraded. The degradation of tomosyn in response to high glucose was blocked by inhibitors of the proteasomal pathway. Using 32P labeling and mass spectrometry, we showed that tomosyn-2 is phosphorylated in response to high glucose, phorbol esters, and analogs of cAMP, all key insulin secretagogues. We identified 11 phosphorylation sites in tomosyn-2. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate phosphomimetic (Ser → Asp) and loss-of-function (Ser → Ala) mutants. The Ser → Asp mutant had enhanced protein turnover compared with the Ser → Ala mutant and wild type tomosyn-2. Additionally, the Ser → Asp tomosyn-2 mutant was ineffective at inhibiting insulin secretion. Using a proteomic screen for tomosyn-2-binding proteins, we identified Hrd-1, an E3-ubiquitin ligase. We showed that tomosyn-2 ubiquitination is increased by Hrd-1, and knockdown of Hrd-1 by short hairpin RNA resulted in increased abundance in tomosyn-2 protein levels. Taken together, our results reveal a mechanism by which enhanced phosphorylation of a negative regulator of secretion, tomosyn-2, in response to insulin secretagogues targets it to degradation by the Hrd-1 E3-ubiquitin ligase.

Plasma glucose is the major determinant of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. The secretion of insulin in response to glucose is biphasic (1.Barbosa R.M. Silva A.M. Tomé A.R. Stamford J.A.

Gromada J. Barg S. Göpel S. The cell physiology of biphasic insulin secretion.News Physiol. Sci. 2000; 15: 72-77PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose enters β-cells via the glucose transporter type 2. Once inside the cell, glucose is metabolized to yield an increase in the ATP:ADP ratio, which leads to closing of K-ATP channels, membrane depolarization, and opening of the voltage-dependent calcium channels. The subsequent increase in cytosolic free calcium causes insulin granules to fuse to the plasma membrane in a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-dependent manner and release insulin into the bloodstream. This K-ATP channel-dependent first phase of secretion occurs from a relatively small pool of readily releasable granules. Glucose stimulates the second phase of insulin secretion by activating K-ATP channel-independent amplifying pathways (4.Straub S.G. Sharp G.W. Glucose-stimulated signaling pathways in biphasic insulin secretion.Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2002; 18: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The insulin granule is mobilized from a reserve pool of granules and ultimately fuses with the plasma membrane through the formation of the SNARE complex. The SNARE complex is formed between the plasma membrane proteins, syntaxin and SNAP-25, and the insulin granule protein, VAMP-2/synaptobrevin. Another vesicle-bound protein, synaptotagmin, upon Ca2+ binding, accelerates the last step in the fusion of two membranes by promoting SNARE complex formation (5.Sudhof T.C. The synaptic vesicle cycle.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Each step in exocytosis is spatially and temporally regulated by several accessory proteins that undergo protein-protein interactions to affect the rate of formation of the SNARE complex and exocytosis. Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the SNARE and SNARE-interacting proteins regulates protein-protein interactions and modulates SNARE assembly during exocytosis (6.Nishi H. Hashimoto K.

Together, this suggests that the N-terminal domain in tomosyn-1 and, by extension, tomosyn-2 plays a critical role for imparting the inhibitory effects on exocytosis. The N-terminal domain of tomosyn-1 contains a hypervariable region (HVR), 2The abbreviations used are: HVRhypervariable regionRVVretroviral vectorTPAphorbol esterCaMKIIcalcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIUPPubiquitination-proteasome pathway8-Br-cAMP8-bromo-cyclic AMP. between amino acids 702 and 822.

A protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site at serine 724, was identified in the HVR of tomosyn-1 (20.Baba T. Sakisaka T. Mochida S. Takai Y.

We previously positionally cloned tomosyn-2 as a gene underlying a diabetes susceptibility locus in an F2 intercross of the C57BL/6 and BTBR mouse strains (10.Bhatnagar S. Oler A.T. Rabaglia M.E.

Positional cloning of a type 2 diabetes quantitative trait locus; tomosyn-2, a negative regulator of insulin secretion.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002323Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Islets from congenic mice carrying the BTBR allele of tomosyn-2 (harboring an S912L mutation) had an attenuated response to stimulation of insulin secretion compared with islets carrying the C57BL/6 allele. This reduction in secretion was observed in the presence of normal levels of tomosyn-1, suggesting a nonoverlapping role of tomosyn-1 and tomosyn-2 in inhibiting insulin secretion. Here, we describe a novel mechanism whereby insulin secretagogues enhance turnover of tomosyn-2 as part of a mechanism to stimulate insulin secretion. We identify phosphorylation sites in tomosyn-2 that respond to insulin secretagogues and an E3-ubiquitin ligase that targets tomosyn-2 for degradation. Insulin was measured with an in-house ELISA using an anti-insulin antibody from Fitzgerald Industries. Antibodies used to perform experiments were as follows: mouse anti-Myc antibody from Millipore; mouse anti-V5 antibody from Invitrogen; rabbit anti-tomosyn from Synaptic Systems; rabbit anti-ubiquitin from Cell Signaling Technology; and rabbit anti-Hrd-1 from ProteaTech.

After 2 h, cells were stimulated for 2 h in 100 μl of KRB buffer containing 3 mm glucose + 3 mm 8-bromo (Br)-cAMP. The incubation buffer was collected to determine the amount of insulin secreted under varying conditions.

The cells were washed once and incubated with phosphate-free KRB for 2 h containing 0.2 mCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphoric acid. After 2 h, cells were stimulated with glucose for 30 min and harvested, and tomosyn-2 was immunoprecipitated via anti-V5 antibody, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Immunoprecipitated samples were incubated for 15 min in 0.1% TFA followed by 15 min in 8 m urea at ambient temperature and filtered after each incubation step. The filtrate was neutralized with Tris buffer, pH 8.0, reduced, alkylated, digested, desalted, and dried using previously described methods (22.Hebert A.S. Dittenhafer-Reed K.E. Yu W. Bailey D.J.

Peptides from each sample were independently resuspended in 100 mm tetraethylammonium bicarbonate and combined with isobaric labels iTRAQ (ABSciex) or TMT (Thermo) labels dissolved in isopropyl alcohol or acetonitrile, respectively. Alternatively, some phosphorylation samples were examined without labeling and quantified by comparing area under the curve. All samples were prepared in at least biological duplicates. The mixture was incubated at ambient temperature for 2 h followed by pooling the samples together and drying in a speed vac. At this point, samples were enriched for phosphorylation using Fe(III) immobilized metal affinity chromatography according to previously described protocols (23.Phanstiel D.H. Brumbaugh J.

Methods. 2011; 8: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Unbound material was retained for binding partner interaction analyses. Peptide samples were injected onto a nano-LC reversed phased column in 0.2% formic acid and eluted with increasing acetonitrile. Eluted peptides were analyzed with a Velos Orbitrap (Thermo) or Orbitrap Elite (Thermo). In brief, MS1 survey scans were performed at 30,000 or 60,000 resolving power at 400 m/z in the Orbitrap. Peptides with charge state 2 or higher, selected for MS/MS, were fragmented by HCD (beam type collision), and the fragments were analyzed in the Orbitrap at 7,500 to 15,000 resolving power. Spectra were converted to text files, searched against a target-decoy Rattus norvegicus database, downloaded from Uniprot, with the sequence of the clones appended, using the OMSSA search algorithm (24.Geer L.Y. Markey S.P. Kowalak J.A. Wagner L. Xu M. Maynard D.M. Yang X. Shi W. Bryant S.H. Open mass spectrometry search algorithm.J.

The COMPASS software suite was used to filter peptide search results to 1% false discovery rate based on E-value and mass error, to quantify isobaric tag reporter ion intensities and group proteins, and to further filter protein results to 1% false discovery rate (25.Nesvizhskii A.I.

RNA from INS1 (832/13) and HEK293FT cells were extracted using Qiagen RNeasy plus kit. Following extraction, RNA was used for cDNA synthesis (Applied Biosystems). The mRNA abundance was determined by quantitative PCR using FastStart SYBR Green (Roche Applied Science), and gene expression was calculated by comparative ΔCT method. INS1 (832/13) and HEK293FT cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). Total cell lysate (1 mg) was precleared with 25 μl of equilibrated protein A/G beads for 30 min in lysis buffer with 0.2% BSA, followed by incubation with ∼2 μg of primary antibody for 16 h at 4 °C. After 16 h, 50 μl of equilibrated beads were added to the lysate to mix for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were spun at 2,000 × g for 3 min and were washed three times with 1× lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated protein was eluted in 2.5× Western Loading buffer containing 1 mm DTT. The samples were subjected to immunoblot for analysis. Hrd-1 (WT)-pCMV or Hrd-1(C296A, C294A)-pCMV plasmids were co-transfected with the tomosyn-2-V5-RVV plasmid in INS1 (832/13) cells. After 36 h of transfection, 50 μm MG132 was added to the cells for 2 h, followed by lysis: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)), 2.5 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot were performed. Data were expressed as means ± S.E. The statistical comparisons were made using Student's t test at p < 0.05. We tested the ability of tomosyn-2 to inhibit insulin secretion from human islets. Adenovirus encoding either mouse tomosyn-2 or LacZ control was transduced in human islets for 48 h at 8 mm glucose. After viral infection, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was performed in islets expressing tomosyn-2 or LacZ control at varying glucose concentrations. Tomosyn-2 inhibited fractional insulin secretion by ∼70%, at 11, 16.7, and 20 mm glucose but had no effect on basal insulin secretion (Fig. 1A). Because tomosyn-2 inhibits insulin secretion, we hypothesized that cellular signals that activate insulin secretion should block the inhibitory action of tomosyn-2. Thus, we asked whether glucose stimulates degradation of endogenous tomosyn. We treated INS1 (832/13) cells with 15 mm glucose and assessed the abundance of tomosyn protein after treatment with cycloheximide (50 μm). Within 1 h of treatment with cycloheximide, the abundance of tomosyn protein was reduced by 50% (Fig. 1B). No further reduction in tomosyn protein abundance was observed after 1 h of high glucose treatment. In contrast to cells treated with 15 mm glucose, the turnover of tomosyn protein was very slow in cells treated with 3 mm glucose. We determined whether high glucose increases tomosyn protein turnover by the proteasomal pathway. INS1 (832/13) cells were treated with 15 mm glucose in the presence of either 50 μm proteasome inhibitor MG132 or DMSO for 4 h. Treatment with MG132 reduced tomosyn degradation by ∼40%, suggesting that tomosyn is degraded by the proteasomal pathway. Phosphorylation is an established post-translational modification signal for enhancing the turnover of proteins (28.Swaney D.L. Beltrao P. Starita L. Guo A. Rush J. Fields S. Krogan N.J. Villén J. Global analysis of phosphorylation and ubiquitylation cross-talk in protein degradation.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). We asked whether tomosyn-2 is phosphorylated in response to the activation of signaling pathways known to promote insulin secretion. We first examined the effect of glucose on the phosphorylation of tomosyn-2 in intact INS1 (832/13) cells. INS1 (832/13) cells overexpressing tomosyn-2-V5 and control plasmid were pre-labeled with 0.2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h. After 2 h, the cells were treated with 3, 5, 7, 11, or 15 mm glucose for 30 min. Whole cell lysates were prepared, and the phosphorylation of tomosyn-2-V5 was assessed by quantifying incorporation of 32P by autoradiography. Glucose caused a dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of tomosyn-2 (Fig. 2A). In pancreatic islets, activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) was involved in the signaling pathways that link nutrient sensing to insulin secretion. We hypothesized that the activation of PKA and PKC by analogs of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) and phorbol esters (TPA), respectively, results in the phosphorylation of tomosyn-2. We quantitated the extent of tomosyn-2 phosphorylation and identified specific sites phosphorylated in response to TPA, 8-Br-cAMP, and glucose. Tomosyn-2-myc was transiently transfected in INS1 (832/13) cells for 36 h. After 36 h, cells were treated with either 1 μm TPA at 1.5 mm glucose, 3 mm 8-Br-"
https://openalex.org/W2135175959,"Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathy that is caused by an insufficiency of the mitochondrial protein, frataxin. Our previous studies described the generation of FRDA induced pluripotent stem cell lines (FA3 and FA4 iPS) that retained genetic characteristics of this disease. Here we extend these studies, showing that neural derivatives of FA iPS cells are able to differentiate into functional neurons, which don't show altered susceptibility to cell death, and have normal mitochondrial function. Furthermore, FA iPS-derived neural progenitors are able to differentiate into functional neurons and integrate in the nervous system when transplanted into the cerebellar regions of host adult rodent brain. These are the first studies to describe both in vitro and in vivo characterization of FA iPS-derived neurons and demonstrate their capacity to survive long term. These findings are highly significant for developing FRDA therapies using patient-derived stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2157831032,"FtsZ is an essential cell division protein in Escherichia coli, and its localization, filamentation, and bundling at the mid-cell are required for Z-ring stability. Once assembled, the Z-ring recruits a series of proteins that comprise the bacterial divisome. Zaps (FtsZ-associated proteins) stabilize the Z-ring by increasing lateral interactions between individual filaments, bundling FtsZ to provide a scaffold for divisome assembly. The x-ray crystallographic structure of E. coli ZapA was determined, identifying key structural differences from the existing ZapA structure from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including a charged α-helix on the globular domains of the ZapA tetramer. Key helix residues in E. coli ZapA were modified using site-directed mutagenesis. These ZapA variants significantly decreased FtsZ bundling in protein sedimentation assays when compared with WT ZapA proteins. Electron micrographs of ZapA-bundled FtsZ filaments showed the modified ZapA variants altered the number of FtsZ filaments per bundle. These in vitro results were corroborated in vivo by expressing the ZapA variants in an E. coli ΔzapA strain. In vivo, ZapA variants that altered FtsZ bundling showed an elongated phenotype, indicating improper cell division. Our findings highlight the importance of key ZapA residues that influence the extent of FtsZ bundling and that ultimately affect Z-ring formation in dividing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2013322108,"Macrophages in the lung are the primary cells being infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) during the initial manifestation of tuberculosis. Since the adaptive immune response to Mtb is delayed, innate immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils mount the early immune protection against this intracellular pathogen. Neutrophils are short-lived cells and removal of apoptotic cells by resident macrophages is a key event in the resolution of inflammation and tissue repair. Since anti-inflammatory activity is not compatible with effective immunity to intracellular pathogens, we therefore investigated how uptake of apoptotic neutrophils modulates the function of Mtb-activated human macrophages. We show that Mtb infection exerts a potent proinflammatory activation of human macrophages with enhanced gene activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines and that this response was augmented by apoptotic neutrophils. The enhanced macrophage response is linked to apoptotic neutrophil-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent IL-1β signalling. We also demonstrate that apoptotic neutrophils not only modulate the inflammatory response, but also enhance the capacity of infected macrophages to control intracellular growth of virulent Mtb. Taken together, these results suggest a novel role for apoptotic neutrophils in the modulation of the macrophage-dependent inflammatory response contributing to the early control of Mtb infection."
https://openalex.org/W2058029230,"Acetyl-CoA plays a fundamental role in cell signaling and metabolic pathways, with its cellular levels tightly controlled through reciprocal regulation of enzymes that mediate its synthesis and catabolism. ACOT12, the primary acetyl-CoA thioesterase in the liver of human, mouse, and rat, is responsible for cleavage of the thioester bond within acetyl-CoA, producing acetate and coenzyme A for a range of cellular processes. The enzyme is regulated by ADP and ATP, which is believed to be mediated through the ligand-induced oligomerization of the thioesterase domains, whereby ATP induces active dimers and tetramers, whereas apo- and ADP-bound ACOT12 are monomeric and inactive. Here, using a range of structural and biophysical techniques, it is demonstrated that ACOT12 is a trimer rather than a tetramer and that neither ADP nor ATP exert their regulatory effects by altering the oligomeric status of the enzyme. Rather, the binding site and mechanism of ADP regulation have been determined to occur through two novel regulatory regions, one involving a large loop that links the thioesterase domains (Phe154-Thr178), defined here as RegLoop1, and a second region involving the C terminus of thioesterase domain 2 (Gln304-Gly326), designated RegLoop2. Mutagenesis confirmed that Arg312 and Arg313 are crucial for this mode of regulation, and novel interactions with the START domain are presented together with insights into domain swapping within eukaryotic thioesterases for substrate recognition.

Acetyl-CoA is an important component in the biogenic synthesis of signaling molecules, and together with the role of the liver in managing and supplying acetyl-CoA and its metabolic derivatives to other organs, highlights the importance of ACOT12 and need for a detailed understanding of its regulation. ACOT12 has shown to be reciprocally regulated by ADP and ATP, with the current dogma for the mechanism of regulation, believed to occur through induced oligomerization of the thioesterase domains, whereby ATP promote these domains into active dimer and tetramer forms, whereas apo- and ADP-bound ACOT12 are inactive monomers (10.Suematsu N.

Here, we describe the crystal structures of the thioesterase domains of ACOT12 both in the apo- and ADP-bound forms to provide the first structural basis for thioesterase regulation. Using a range of complementary biophysical techniques, we demonstrate that neither ADP nor ATP regulate the oligomerization of the enzyme but instead influence the mobility of two flexible regions critical for thioesterase activity (21.Marfori M.

Rather than forming a tetramer, we show, using crystallography, small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), that the enzyme forms a trimer of double hotdog protomers, revealing a domain-swapping event between eukaryote thioesterases for substrate recognition. Finally, we present the first view of the interactions between the START and juxtapositional thioesterase domains to provide a detailed account of thioesterase regulation, which is likely to be conserved throughout evolution. The thioesterase domains of human ACOT12 (residues 7–336; accession no. NC_000005.9) were cloned into the pNIC-Bsa4 expression vector at the Structural Genomics Consortium (Stockholm, Sweden). The protein was recombinantly expressed as a His-tagged fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS or BL21(DE3) gold pRARE2 cells by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at an OD of 0.6, and growth continued for 21 h at 291–297 K. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in His buffer A containing 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. Purification was carried out in very similar fashion in both laboratories and here we describe the one leading to structures 4MOC and 4MOB. Affinity chromatography (HisTrap HP, GE Healthcare) was performed using His buffer A to load and remove unbound proteins, and a gradient elution up to 500 mm imidazole over 10 column volumes used to elute the enzyme. Fractions containing recombinant ACOT12 were pooled and treated with TEV protease (15 μg/ml) for 12 h at 276 K to remove the His-affinity tag (leaving 2 vector encoded amino acids, Ser and Met). The protein was further purified by SEC (S200, 26/60 column, GE Healthcare) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, and then concentrated to 21 mg/ml using an Amicon centrifugal filter. The protein for the apo-ACOT12 structure (PDB code 3B7K) was concentrated to 16.3 mg/ml in a final buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm TCEP, pH 7.5. The purity was assessed to be >95% by SDS-PAGE and stored as 50-μl aliquots at 253 K. Sparse matrix, hanging drop vapor diffusion was used to screen crystallization conditions over a number of commercially available screens, in both the presence and absence of ADP (PEG/Ion, PEG/Ion 2, Crystal Screen, and Crystal Screen 2 from Hampton Research, JCSG+, and PACT from Molecular Dimensions). Briefly, 1.5 μl of the protein sample was combined with an equal volume of reservoir solution and suspended above the requisite reservoir solution. Apo-ACOT12 structure was crystallized with 5 mm acetyl-CoA with 23% PEG 3350, 350 mm sodium thiocyanate. For improved apo-ACOT12 structure, small hexagonal crystals were obtained from slightly modified condition without acetyl-CoA (22% PEG 3350, 400 mm sodium thiocyanate). For ACOT12-ADP, small cuboidal crystals were obtained from PEG/Ion 42 condition (20% PEG 3350, 200 mm potassium phosphate dibasic). These initial crystallization conditions were optimized by screening around different PEG and salt concentrations until large, single, diffraction quality crystals were achieved. The final crystallization mixture contained PEG 3350, 150 mm potassium phosphate dibasic, and 1 mm ADP. Cryocrystallography was undertaken during x-ray diffraction data collection to minimize radiation damage. Briefly, crystals were soaked in reservoir solution containing 15% glycerol or 5% butanediol (PDB code 3B7K) and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen at 100 K. Diffraction data were collected at the Australian Synchrotron on the MX1 and MX2 crystallography beamlines and at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility on ID14-1. Diffraction images were indexed, merged, and scaled using iMOSFLM (22.Rosano C. Zuccotti S. Stefani M. Bucciantini M. Ramponi G. Bolognesi M.

Structures have been deposited to the PDB and were assigned codes 3B7K (apo-ACOT12; 2.7 Å), 4MOC (apo-ACOT12; 2.5 Å), and 4MOB (ACOT12-ADP). Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Each reaction mixture consisted of 39.3 μl of double distilled H2O, 5 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 1 μl of dNTP mix, 1.25 μl each of forward and reverse primers (100 μm), 1 μl of PfuUltra HF polymerase and 1.2 μl of ACOT12 plasmid. Mixtures were heated to 95 °C for 30 s followed by 16 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 7 min. The amplified products were then treated with the restriction enzyme DpnI (1 μl of 10 units/μl) for 1 h at 37 °C to digest the remaining nonmutated parental DNA, and then 1 μl of treated DNA was transformed into XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. The fidelity of the clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Enzyme activity of ACOT12 was measured spectrophotometrically using a coupled color change reaction with 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) as described previously (29.Yamada J. Furihata T. Tamura H.

Each 100-μl assay volume contained 10 mm 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 6 μg of protein, acetyl-CoA at various concentrations as specified, and regulatory molecules (ADP, ATP, GDP, GTP, citric acid, and NADH) at a final concentration of 10 mm. Release of CoA at 412 nm was measured over 20 min at 21 °C in a 96-well plate, and activity was calculated using extinction coefficient Σ412 = 13,600 m−1 cm−1 (29.Yamada J. Furihata T. Tamura H.

SAXS measurements were performed on ACOT12 in the absence and presence of ADP and ATP at the SAXS beamline of the Australian Synchrotron. Each SAXS measurement represents the average of ten 1-s exposures and were performed on a dilution series of protein from 5 to 0.1 mg/ml. To minimize radiation damage, samples flowed through a 1.5-mm quartz capillary at a rate of 4 μl/s. A Pilatus 1 m detector (Dektris) with a 1.6-m camera length was used with an x-ray energy of 12 KeV, giving a Q range from 0.01 to 0.5 Å−1. Averaging of images, subtraction of blanks, and radial integration was performed using the beamline control software ScatterBrain (Australian Synchrotron), and all measurements were made at 25 °C. Scattering intensities I(q) for sample and buffer were recorded as a function of scattering vector q. The scattering profiles were calculated after subtracting the scattering contributions of buffer. Theoretical scattering curves of crystallographic atomic models were computed using CRYSOL (33.Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M. CRYSOL-a program to evaluate X-ray solution scattering of biological macromolecules from atomic coordinates.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2766) Google Scholar). As mentioned previously, ACOT12 is of major importance, and there is a particular need for a detailed understanding of its regulation. To address this, because the structural basis for induced oligomerization and regulation of thioesterases is yet to be elucidated, we set out to determine the high resolution structures of the ACOT12 thioesterase domains in the absence and presence of ADP to better understand this regulatory mechanism. The crystals of the apo-enzyme were initially solved at 2.7 Å resolution. The asymmetric unit contained a trimer, which did not fit the oligomerization described in the literature. A large loop on the outer face of monomer (residues 153–179) did not have electron density, and density was also missing for the C-terminal part of the construct. We therefore decided to try to improve the crystal quality and try to stabilize these regions in the protein. A new crystal form of the apo-enzyme was discovered where one monomer was present in the asymmetric unit and the crystals diffracting to slightly higher resolution (2.5 Å; outer shell mean(I)/sd(I), 2.3; Rpim, 0.33; Table 1). This crystal structure provided clear contiguous electron density enabling 267 residues to be modeled (R/Rfree, 0.20/0.25 and good stereochemistry; Table 1), with the exception of two regions corresponding to residues 154–178 and 304–336 similar to the original structure. Notably, both of these regions are visible in the ADP-bound ACOT12 described below. The apo structures are very similar (average monomer r.m.s.d. of 0.4 Å for Cα atoms) with the major differences at the conformations of the surface exposed residues and in the 10 amino acids preceding the disordered C-terminal part (modeled only to one chain in the trimeric structure). In the following we will discuss the higher resolution structure unless otherwise stated. The ACOT12 monomer contained two hotdog domains, each comprised of a 5 stranded β-sheet enclosing a central α-helix, dimerized with the two central α-helices face-to-face, and β-sheets associating through β2 surrounding the central α-helices (Fig. 1, A and B).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for ACOT12 and ACOT12:ADPACOT12 (PDB code 3B7K)ACOT12 (PDB code 4MOC)ACOT12:ADP (PDB code 4MOB)Wavelength (Å)0.934000.95370.9537Resolution range (Å)2.70–20 (2.70–2.80)2.50–31.38 (2.50–2.60)2.40–34.71 (2.40–2.51)Space groupC2221P321I23Unit cell82.70, 126.05, and 185.34 Å; 90, 90, and 90°123.55, 123.55, and 49.75 Å, 90, 90, and 120°138.85 Å; 90°Total reflections191,938 (20,062)116,336 (11,446)409,008 (46,051)Unique reflections26,807 (2737)14,338 (1505)17,555 (2114)Multiplicity7.2 (7.3)8.1 (7.6)23.3 (21.8)Completeness (%)99.3 (100)93.5 (87.6)100 (100)Mean I/σ(I)12.5 (3.4)14.9 (2.3)18.9 (2.6)Wilson B-factor (Å2)69.8042.2543.61Rpim0.116 (0.598)aRmerge value.0.037 (0.329)0.030 (0.300)Rwork0.230.200.16Rfree0.280.250.21No. of atoms22402671Macromolecules591721692576Ligands1444872Water07195Protein residues769273320r.m.s.d.Bonds (Å)0.0080.0040.010Angles1.11°0.86°1.23°Ramachandran favored (%)94.8195.5696.86Ramachandran allowed (%)4.924.443.14Ramachandran outliers (%)0.270.000.00a Rmerge value. Open table in a new tab Coenzyme A (CoA), not added to the crystallization conditions, was identified at one of two symmetry related active sites, occupying the interface of the hotdog dimers and inducing a β-bulge (Fig. 2, A and B). That only half of the potential CoA binding sites contained ligand is similar to that of mouse ACOT7 (34.Forwood J.K. Thakur A.S. Guncar G. Marfori M. Mouradov D. Meng W. Robinson J. Huber T.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10382-10387Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and emerging to be a distinguishing feature between the double hotdog thioesterases found in eukaryotes, and the single thioesterase domains of prokaryotic thioesterases, since the former contain two non-identical tandem hotdog domains creating symmetry related, but chemically distinct binding sites, while the latter contain only a single thioesterase domain and identical CoA binding sites (see (34.Forwood J.K. Thakur A.S. Guncar G. Marfori M. Mouradov D. Meng W. Robinson J. Huber T. Kellie S. Martin J.L. Structural basis for recruitment of tandem hotdog domains in acyl-CoA thioesterase 7 and its role in inflammation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10382-10387Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and discussion for full description). Since the structural basis for the preference of CoA-binding in eukaryotic thioesterases has yet to be determined, we superimposed CoA into the non-binding site, and compared these two pockets. Binding site one (containing CoA in our structure), bound through H-bonding and salt bridge interactions involving residues clustered into four regions (R): R1a (TAS55), R1b (STS84), R1c (R144); and R1d (KFRG237), while superimposition of the CoA molecule onto binding site two, revealed major clashes with K228 and T257, corresponding to residues from the analogous regions R2a and R2b (Fig. 2) respectively. Interestingly, despite the low sequence identity between ACOT7 and ACOT12 of ∼30%, the CoA binding pockets are well conserved, but located on opposite domains, indicating that a domain switch for substrate binding has occurred (Fig. 2C). In both cases, the CoA binding site is distinguished by a TAS binding motif in R1a, while the non-CoA binding site contains a less favorable binding pocket and steric clashes. This will prove to be a useful feature in the prediction of CoA binding sites in eukaryotic thioesterases. In similar fashion to the CoA binding site, the active site residues for ACOT12 also reside on the opposite domains to those for ACOT7, and comprised of D36 and N195 in ACOT12, equivalent to the ACOT7 active site (N24, D213) (Fig. 2C) (34.Forwood J.K.

https://openalex.org/W2038194076,"Mitotic progression is regulated largely through dynamic and reversible protein phosphorylation that is modulated by opposing actions of protein kinases and phosphatases. In this study, we show that phosphatase 1 nuclear targeting subunit (Pnuts) functions as a master regulator of mitosis by modulating protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Overexpression of Pnuts in Xenopus egg extracts inhibited both mitotic and meiotic exit. Immunodepletion of Pnuts from egg extracts revealed its essential functions in mitotic entry and maintenance. The level of Pnuts oscillates during the cell cycle and peaks in mitosis. Pnuts destruction during M-phase exit is mediated by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)-targeted ubiquitination and proteolysis, and conserved destruction motifs of Pnuts. Disruption of Pnuts degradation delayed M-phase exit, suggesting it as an important mechanism to permit M-phase exit.

Disruption of Pnuts degradation delayed M-phase exit, suggesting it as an important mechanism to permit M-phase exit. As a fundamental process of life, cell division in M-phase is tightly regulated and evolutionarily conserved. Mitotic defects are often associated with human diseases, particularly cancer, whereas antimitotic agents are among the most successful drugs for cancer therapy (1.Janssen A. Medema R.H. Mitosis as an anti-cancer target.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mitotic entry, progression, and exit involve extensive cellular reorganization that is programmed and regulated through sophisticated molecular mechanisms. A multitude of existing studies stress the importance of mitotic phosphorylation that occurs on hundreds of substrate proteins in a spatially and temporally defined manner. Consistently, a group of Ser/Thr kinases has been well recognized as central regulators of mitosis (2.Nigg E.A. Mitotic kinases as regulators of cell division and its checkpoints.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). The maturation promoting factor (MPF), composed of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) 4The abbreviations used are: Cdk1cyclin-dependent kinase 1Pnutsphosphatase 1 nuclear targeting subunit 1PPprotein phosphataseAPC/Canaphase-promoting complex/cyclosomeMBPmyelin basic proteinCSFcytostatic factorD-boxdestruction boxO-boxOrc1-destructing boxDmD-box mutantOmO-box mutantODmdouble O-box/D-box mutant. and its activator, cyclin B, is regarded as the principal mitotic kinase. The activity of Cdk1 is responsible for mitotic phosphorylation of a broad spectrum of substrates that control virtually all aspects of M-phase progression. Accordingly, regulated activation and deactivation of Cdk1 have been well characterized as molecular events that dictate M-phase entry and exit (3.Malumbres M. Harlow E. Hunt T. Hunter T. Lahti J.M.

To a lesser extent, Plk1, Aurora A, Aurora B, and several other mitotic kinases have also been shown to function as important M-phase regulators. Disrupting the function of these kinases leads to various defects in mitotic progression (4.Lens S.M. Voest E.E. Medema R.H.

As all reversible phosphorylation events are regulated by counteracting protein kinases and protein phosphatases, there is a clear rationale for an essential regulatory role played by protein phosphatases in M-phase. However, in contrast to that of protein kinases, the specific involvement of phosphatases in M-phase regulation only recently came to light (5.Mochida S. Hunt T. Protein phosphatases and their regulation in the control of mitosis.EMBO Rep. 2012; 13: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6.Bollen M. Gerlich D.W. Lesage B.

Phosphatases:providing safe passage through mitotic exit.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It has been shown in budding yeast that the dual specificity phosphatase Cdc14 plays a critical role in promoting mitotic exit through dephosphorylation of Cdk1 substrates (8.Stegmeier F. Amon A. Closing mitosis: the functions of the Cdc14 phosphatase and its regulation.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 203-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, the mitotic function of Cdc14 in budding yeast does not seem to be fully conserved in higher organisms, suggesting the existence of alternative Cdk1-counteracting phosphatases, particularly protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and PP2A (6.Bollen M.

PP1 and PP2A are the major forms of serine/threonine phosphatases in animal cells, and inhibition of these phosphatases has been long known to alter mitotic progression. Cellular PP1 and PP2A rarely exist in free forms; instead, these catalytic subunits associate with numerous regulatory subunits that control their phosphatase activity, substrate specificity, and cellular localization (10.Moorhead G.B. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Ulke-Lemée A. Emerging roles of nuclear protein phosphatases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 11.Peng A. Maller J.L. Serine/threonine phosphatases in the DNA damage response and cancer.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 5977-5988Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the specific function of PP1 and PP2A in M-phase regulation is largely unknown, an elegant example has been provided through characterization of the PP2A-B55δ complex as a mitotic regulator. Depletion of B55δ led to defects in dephosphorylation of Cdk1 substrates and mitotic exit, suggesting that this phosphatase complex directly or indirectly antagonizes Cdk1 (12.Castilho P.V.

In addition to regulation of Cdk1 substrates, PP1 and PP2A have also been shown to antagonize the action of Plk1, Aurora, and other mitotic kinases (6.Bollen M. Gerlich D.W. Lesage B.

Phosphatases:providing safe passage through mitotic exit.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that PP1 opposes the mitotic function of Aurora B at various subcellular sites, leading to delicate control of the spatial gradient of Aurora B substrate phosphorylation (17.Emanuele M.J.

Obviously, the vast content and complex pattern of protein phosphorylation in mitosis can be much better understood with identification of various phosphatase complexes involved in M-phase progression and delineation of molecular mechanisms through which these mitotic phosphatases are regulated. Phosphatase 1 nuclear targeting subunit 1 (Pnuts), also known as PPP1R10, was described as one of the nuclear regulators of PP1 that are responsible for the nuclear retention of PP1 (20.Allen P.B. Kwon Y.G. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Isolation and characterization of PNUTS, a putative protein phosphatase 1 nuclear targeting subunit.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4089-4095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It was suggested that Pnuts possesses RNA binding activity and may be involved in RNA processing (21.Kim Y.M. Watanabe T. Allen P.B. Kim Y.M. Lee S.J. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kwon Y.G.

Moreover, Pnuts was biochemically identified within a 200-kDa protein complex that also contains PP1, Tox4, and WDR83. The function of this protein complex is unclear, but it was suggested to regulate chromatin structure and RNA polymerase II phosphorylation (22.Lee J.H. You J. Dobrota E. Skalnik D.G.

Pnuts was found to bind DNA adducts generated by cisplatin and other DNA-damaging agents (23.Bounaix Morand du Puch C. Barbier E. Kraut A. Couté Y. Fuchs J. Buhot A. Livache T. Sève M. Favier A.

The suggested function of Pnuts also includes modulation of tumor suppressor genes, such as retinoblastoma (Rb) and Phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), and at least in the case of Rb, Pnuts functions through inhibition of PP1 (27.Udho E.

Finally, Pnuts enhances in vitro chromatin decondensation in a PP1-dependent manner, and expression of a PP1 binding-deficient mutant form of Pnuts in cells caused defects in chromatin decondensation at telophase (30.Landsverk H.B.

As several protein phosphatase complexes emerged as a new class of cell cycle regulators, we sought to reveal a potential role of Pnuts in cell cycle regulation. In this study, we discovered that Pnuts functions as an essential regulator of M-phase entry, maintenance, and exit. The cell cycle-dependent accumulation and degradation of Pnuts are tightly regulated and critical for the biochemical progression of M-phase. Commercial antibodies used in this study include: Cdc27 antibody purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories; PP1 and Pnuts antibodies purchased from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX); histone H3, phospho-H3 Ser-10, Cdc20, and phospho-CDK substrate antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); MBP antibody from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA); GST antibody from Sigma; and ubiquitin and β-actin antibody from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Xenopus Pnuts were generated against the N-terminal sequence of Pnuts. Samples were harvested in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then electrotransferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 1× TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h, incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h, washed three times in 1× TBST, incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) for 1 h, washed three times, and then detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate kit (Pierce). Immunodepletion was performed in Xenopus egg extracts as described previously (31.Peng A. Wang L. Fisher L.A. Greatwall and Polo-like kinase 1 coordinate to promote checkpoint recovery.J Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 28996-29004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, anti-mouse or -rabbit magnetic beads (New England Biolabs) were washed three times with a washing buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5% Tween 20) and then incubated with antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Beads conjugated to the antibody were washed and then added into Xenopus egg extracts. After incubation for 30 min, the beads were removed with a magnet, and the remaining extract was collected for experiments. The Xenopus Pnuts gene was cloned from a Xenopus oocyte cDNA library, as described previously (32.Peng A. Lewellyn A.L. Schiemann W.P. Maller J.L. Repo-Man controls a protein phosphatase 1-dependent threshold for DNA damage checkpoint activation.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), using the following targeting sequence for primers (atggggtcagggcc; ttatggcagtggtgg). The gene was then inserted into the pGEX4T-1 vector with an N-terminal GST tag or the pMAL-parallel II plasmid with an N-terminal MBP tag. Pnuts mutants used in this study were produced by site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutations were confirmed by sequencing. These proteins were then expressed in BL21 bacterial cells and purified with glutathione or amylose beads. Recombinant Emi2 was provided by Dr. J. Liu (Cal Poly Pomona). For reisolation of MBP- or GST-tagged proteins from Xenopus egg extracts, proteins bound to either amylose or glutathione beads were added to egg extract and incubated at room temperature. The beads were separated from the extract with low speed centrifugation, washed three times, and then resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. The MBP-tagged N terminus (amino acids 1–27) of histone H3, a gift from Dr. M. L. Goldberg, was expressed in BL21 cells and purified with amylose resin. Purified histone H3 peptide was phosphorylated with Aurora A kinase (a gift from Dr. M. Y. Tsai) in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 100 μm ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C. Following the kinase reaction, the protein bound to beads was washed with modified extract buffer (1 m KCl, 11 mm MgCl2, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 500 mm sucrose, and 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.7) and eluted with 10 mm maltose in modified extract buffer. For the PP1 phosphatase assay, prephosphorylated histone H3 peptide was incubated with PP1 (New England Biolabs) in phosphatase buffer (New England Biolabs) with and without Pnuts protein at room temperature for the time indicated. Small aliquots were removed at the indicated time points and diluted 1:10 in Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting. Cytostatic factor (CSF) extracts were freshly prepared as described previously (31.Peng A. Wang L. Fisher L.A. Greatwall and Polo-like kinase 1 coordinate to promote checkpoint recovery.J Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 28996-29004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Eggs were dejellied with 2% cysteine in 1× extract buffer (1 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, and 500 mm sucrose), washed four times with 1× extract buffer, and then washed once with 1× modified extract buffer (1 m KCl, 11 mm MgCl2, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 500 mm sucrose, and 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.7). Eggs were packed in centrifuge tubes with low speed centrifugation and then crushed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The cytoplasmic layer was further separated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For cycling extracts, eggs were rinsed with distilled water and then soaked in water for 10 min before being dejellied with 2% cysteine in 1× extract buffer. They were washed five times in 0.2× Marc's Modified Ringers buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, and KOH to pH 7.8). The Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, was added to 10 ng/ml until the animal poles rotated. The eggs were then washed with 0.2× Marc's Modified Ringers 10 times and 1× extract buffer four times. Eggs were packed by low speed centrifugation. The eggs were crushed 35 min after the addition of A23187 by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The cytoplasmic layer was transferred to new tubes, and energy mix (7.5 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm ATP, 1 MgCl2) was added. The cytoplasmic layer was further separated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. We assessed the role of Pnuts in M-phase regulation using Xenopus egg extract, an in vitro model of cell cycle progression that has been widely used to study mitotic kinases and phosphatases (33.Crane R.F.

To examine the role of Pnuts in M-phase exit, recombinant Pnuts proteins with GST or MBP tag were purified and added to Xenopus extracts at severalfold over endogenous Pnuts level (Figs. 1B and 3B). The cell cycle stage was determined by the mitotic phosphorylation of Cdc27 that can be judged by retarded mobility in gel, phosphorylation of other mitotic substrates that can be recognized using a phospho-CDK substrate antibody, and the morphology of sperm nuclei incubated in the extracts. CSF extract that is naturally arrested in metaphase was released by the addition of calcium. Although the control extract entered interphase following the addition of calcium, Pnuts-supplemented extract remained in M-phase (Fig. 1C). A similar defect of M-phase exit was observed upon the addition of Pnuts in extracts without presupplementation of sperm nuclei (Fig. 1D). The release of CSF extract better recapitulates the condition of meiotic exit than mitotic exit (37.Tunquist B.J. Maller J.L. Under arrest: cytostatic factor (CSF)-mediated metaphase arrest in vertebrate eggs.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 683-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, increasing Pnuts level in cycling egg extract also extended mitosis (Fig. 1E). When added to CSF extract, roscovitine inhibits Cdk1, allowing its substrates to be dephosphorylated by counteracting phosphatases and the M-phase extract to be released into interphase (38.Wu J.Q. Guo J.Y. Tang W. Yang C.S. Freel C.D. Chen C. Nairn A.C. Kornbluth S. PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of phosphoproteins at mitotic exit is controlled by inhibitor-1 and PP1 phosphorylation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 644-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Increased expression of Pnuts delayed roscovitine-induced M-phase exit (Fig. 1F), suggesting that it may prevent dephosphorylation of mitotic phosphoproteins. Collectively, these results characterize Pnuts as an inhibitor of M-phase exit.FIGURE 3.Pnuts regulates M-phase through PP1. A, wild-type, but not W393A mutant, Pnuts binds PP1. MBP-Pnuts bound to amylose resin was incubated in Xenopus egg extracts and then reisolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The input extract and pulldown products were examined by immunoblotting for MBP and PP1. B, supplementation of WT or W393A MBP-Pnuts in Xenopus egg extracts. Extract samples were immunoblotted using anti-Pnuts antibody. C, as in Fig. 1C, calcium was added into CSF extracts to induce M-phase exit, with or without WT or W393A Pnuts. Extract samples were harvested after 30 min of incubation and analyzed by immunoblotting. Phosphorylated Cdc27 is indicated by P. D, PP1 (New England Biolabs, 0.42 unit/μl) was added into CSF extracts to induce M-phase exit, with or without WT or W393A Pnuts. Extract samples were harvested after 30 min of incubation and analyzed by immunoblotting. E, CSF extracts were mock-treated (−), depleted of Pnuts as in Fig. 2A, or co-depleted of Pnuts and PP1γ, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Immunoblotting of phospho-CDK (p-CDK) substrates, Cdc27, and PP1 is shown. F, CSF extracts with or without supplementation of MBP-Pnuts were treated with calcium. Extract samples were collected at the indicated time points and analyzed by immunoblotting for phospho-Aurora A (p-Aurora A), phospho-H3 (p-H3), and H3. G, the MBP-H3-S10 substrate was generated and prephosphorylated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PP1 was used to dephosphorylate the substrate in vitro, with or without the addition of Pnuts protein. Immunoblots of phopho-H3 Ser-10, MBP, and Pnuts are shown. H, purified WT Aurora A was added to interphase extracts with or without MBP-Pnuts and incubated at room temperature. Samples were taken at the indicated time points and immunoblotted using phospho-Aurora A and His tag antibodies. I, CSF extracts were diluted (1:5) in the PP1-containing buffer (New England Biolabs) with or without Pnuts. Samples were collected at the indicated time points and analyzed by immunoblotting using phospho-H3, H3, and Cdc27 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we sought to investigate the functional importance of endogenous Pnuts in M-phase. As Pnuts up-regulation in mitosis blocks mitotic exit, we hypothesized that depletion of the endogenous Pnuts in mitosis will affect the length and quality of mitosis. We generated specific antibodies that are capable of removing endogenous Pnuts from CSF extracts. Interestingly, extracts depleted of Pnuts failed to maintain M-phase (Fig. 2, A and B), which can be restored with the add-back of recombinant Pnuts (Fig. 2, A and C). These results therefore support the idea that Pnuts expression is necessary for the maintenance of mitosis. To directly investigate whether Pnuts plays a role in regulation of mitotic entry, we immunodepleted Pnuts in cycling extracts wh"
https://openalex.org/W1982168813,"Misfolding of proinsulin variants in the pancreatic β-cell, a monogenic cause of permanent neonatal-onset diabetes mellitus, provides a model for a disease of protein toxicity. A hot spot for such clinical mutations is found at position B8, conserved as glycine within the vertebrate insulin superfamily. We set out to investigate the molecular basis of the aberrant properties of a proinsulin clinical mutant in which residue Gly(B8) is replaced by Ser(B8). Modular total chemical synthesis was used to prepare the wild-type [Gly(B8)]proinsulin molecule and three analogs: [D-Ala(B8)]proinsulin, [L-Ala(B8)]proinsulin, and the clinical mutant [L-Ser(B8)]proinsulin. The protein diastereomer [D-Ala(B8)]proinsulin produced higher folding yields at all pH values compared with the wild-type proinsulin and the other two analogs, but showed only very weak binding to the insulin receptor. The clinical mutant [L-Ser(B8)]proinsulin impaired folding at pH 7.5 even in the presence of protein-disulfide isomerase. Surprisingly, although [L-Ser(B8)]proinsulin did not fold well under the physiological conditions investigated, once folded the [L-Ser(B8)]proinsulin protein molecule bound to the insulin receptor more effectively than wild-type proinsulin. Such paradoxical gain of function (not pertinent in vivo due to impaired secretion of the mutant insulin) presumably reflects induced fit in the native mechanism of hormone-receptor engagement. This work provides insight into the molecular mechanism of a clinical mutation in the insulin gene associated with diabetes mellitus. These results dramatically illustrate the power of total protein synthesis, as enabled by modern chemical ligation methods, for the investigation of protein folding and misfolding."

D283 Med cells were transplanted into athymic mice.A significant expression of ERβ, with little or no ERα, and low AR (androgen receptor) was found in MB cell lines. The compounds tested did not affect cell proliferation. In vivo, we observed a significantly lower growth of D283 Med in nude female mice compared to males. At microscopic examination, tumors from females showed a shift towards differentiation, as evaluated by lower nestin, and higher NSE (neuron-specific enolase) and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) expression compared to males. Tumors from females also showed lower Ki67 and p53 expression. The wild-type ERβ protein (ERβ1) was lost in male tumors, while it was a permanent feature in females, and a strong negative correlation was found between Ki67 and ERβ1 expression. Conversely, tumor levels of ERβ2 and ERβ5 did not significantly differ between genders. Increased levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 were observed in females, suggesting that estrogen may decrease tumor growth through blocking cell cycle progression. An inhibition of the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) signaling was also evident in females.We provides mechanistic evidence supporting the idea that ERβ1 signaling may have pro-differentiation and tumor suppressive function in medulloblastomas."
https://openalex.org/W1970630228,"Vascular plants possess multiple mechanisms for defending themselves against pathogens. One well-characterized defense mechanism is systemic acquired resistance (SAR). In SAR, a plant detects the presence of a pathogen and transmits a signal throughout the plant, inducing changes in the expression of various pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. Once SAR is established, the plant is capable of mounting rapid responses to subsequent pathogen attacks. SAR has been characterized in numerous angiosperm and gymnosperm species; however, despite several pieces of evidence suggesting SAR may also exist in non-vascular plants6-8, its presence in non-vascular plants has not been conclusively demonstrated, in part due to the lack of an appropriate culture system. Here, we describe and use a novel culture system to demonstrate that the moss species Amblystegium serpens does initiate a SAR-like reaction upon inoculation with Pythium irregulare, a common soil-borne oomycete. Infection of A. serpens gametophores by P. irregulare is characterized by localized cytoplasmic shrinkage within 34 h and chlorosis and necrosis within 7 d of inoculation. Within 24 h of a primary inoculation (induction), moss gametophores grown in culture became highly resistant to infection following subsequent inoculation (challenge) by the same pathogen. This increased resistance was a response to the pathogen itself and not to physical wounding. Treatment with β-1,3 glucan, a structural component of oomycete cell walls, was equally effective at triggering SAR. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that this important defense mechanism exists in a non-vascular plant, and, together with previous studies, suggest that SAR arose prior to the divergence of vascular and non-vascular plants. In addition, this novel moss - pathogen culture system will be valuable for future characterization of the mechanism of SAR in moss, which is necessary for a better understanding of the evolutionary history of SAR in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2018029067,"Kit ligand (KitL) and its tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit are critical for germ cells, melanocytes, mastocytes, and hematopoietic stem cells. Alternative splicing of KitL generates membrane-bound KitL (mb-KitL) or soluble KitL, providing survival or cell migration, respectively. Here we analyzed whether c-kit can function both as an adhesion and signaling receptor to mb-KitL presented by the environmental niche. At contacts between fibroblasts and MC/9 mast cells, mb-KitL, and c-kit formed ligand/receptor clusters that formed stable complexes, which resisted dissociation by c-kit blocking mAbs and provided cell anchorage under physiological shear stresses. Clusters recruited tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and induced spatially restricted F-actin polymerization. Mutational analysis of c-kit demonstrated kinase-independent mb-KitL/c-kit clustering, anchorage, F-actin polymerization, and Tyr567-dependent cluster phosphorylation. Kinase inhibition of c-kit by imatinib reduced cluster coalescence, but allowed cluster phosphorylation and F-actin polymerization, which required PI3K recruitment and a newly identified juxtamembrane residue. Synergies between integrin and c-kit-mediated spreading and adhesion of MC/9 cells were studied in vitro on immobilized-KitL/fibronectin surfaces. While c-kit blocking antibodies prevented spreading, imatinib blocked spreading induced by soluble- but not immobilized KitL. Thus, ""mechanical"" activation of c-kit provides signaling, niche-anchorage, and synergies with integrin-mediated adhesion, which is independent of kinase function and resistant to c-kit kinase inhibitors.-"
https://openalex.org/W2108971411,"Background The ribosome, which acts as a platform for mRNA encoded polypeptide synthesis, is also capable of assisting in folding of polypeptide chains. The peptidyl transferase center (PTC) that catalyzes peptide bond formation resides in the domain V of the 23S rRNA of the bacterial ribosome. Proper positioning of the 3′ –CCA ends of the A- and P-site tRNAs via specific interactions with the nucleotides of the PTC are crucial for peptidyl transferase activity. This RNA domain is also the center for ribosomal chaperoning activity. The unfolded polypeptide chains interact with the specific nucleotides of the PTC and are released in a folding competent form. In vitro transcribed RNA corresponding to this domain (bDV RNA) also displays chaperoning activity. Results The present study explores the effects of tRNAs, antibiotics that are A- and P-site PTC substrate analogs (puromycin and blasticidin) and macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin and josamycin) on the chaperoning ability of the E. coli ribosome and bDV RNA. Our studies using mRNA programmed ribosomes show that a tRNA positioned at the P-site effectively inhibits the ribosome's chaperoning function. We also show that the antibiotic blasticidin (that mimics the interaction between 3′–CCA end of P/P-site tRNA with the PTC) is more effective in inhibiting ribosome and bDV RNA chaperoning ability than either puromycin or the macrolide antibiotics. Mutational studies of the bDV RNA could identify the nucleotides U2585 and G2252 (both of which interact with P-site tRNA) to be important for its chaperoning ability. Conclusion Both protein synthesis and their proper folding are crucial for maintenance of a functional cellular proteome. The PTC of the ribosome is attributed with both these abilities. The silencing of the chaperoning ability of the ribosome in the presence of P-site bound tRNA might be a way to segregate these two important functions."
https://openalex.org/W1994184353,"Introduction Staphylococcus aureus sequence type ST398 has recently gained attention due to the spread of methicillin-resistant strains among people exposed to livestock. The aim of this study was to explore temporal changes in the population structure of S. aureus in pigs over the last 40 years with particular reference to the occurrence of ST398. Methods We analysed a unique collection of 91 porcine strains isolated in six countries between 1973 and 2009 using a biotyping scheme described in the 1970's in combination with spa typing and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). The collection comprised 32 historical isolates from 1973–1974 (n = 19) and from 1991–2003 (n = 13), and 59 contemporary isolates from 2004–2009. The latter isolates represented the most common MLST types (ST1, ST9, ST97 and ST433) and spa types isolated from pigs in Europe. Results and Discussion S. aureus sequence type ST398 was not found among old isolates from the 1970's or from 1991–2003, suggesting that this lineage was absent or present at low frequencies in pigs in the past. This hypothesis is supported by the observed association of ST398 with the ovine ecovar, which was not described in pigs by studies carried out in the 1970's. In addition, various phenotypic and genotypic differences were observed between old and contemporary isolates. Some biotypes commonly reported in pigs in the 1970's were either absent (human ecovar) or rare (biotype A) among contemporary isolates. Nine clonal lineages found among old porcine isolates are occasionally reported in pigs today (ST8, ST30, ST97, ST387, ST1092, ST2468) or have never been described in this animal host (ST12, ST133, ST1343). These results indicate that the population structure of porcine S. aureus has changed over the last 40 years and confirm the current theory that S. aureus ST398 does not originate from pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2080008430,"The measurement of cardiac troponin is crucial in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. The performance of troponin measurement is most conveniently monitored by external quality assessment (EQA) programs. The commutability of EQA samples is often unknown and the effectiveness of EQA programs is limited.Commutability of possible EQA materials was evaluated. Commercial control materials used in an EQA program, human serum pools prepared from patient samples, purified analyte preparations, swine sera from model animals and a set of patient samples were measured for cTnI with 4 assays including Abbott Architect, Beckman Access, Ortho Vitros and Siemens Centaur. The measurement results were logarithm-transformed, and the transformed data for patient samples were pairwise analyzed with Deming regression and 95% prediction intervals were calculated for each pair of assays. The commutability of the materials was evaluated by comparing the logarithmic results of the materials with the limits of the intervals. Matrix-related biases were estimated for noncommutable materials. The impact of matrix-related bias on EQA was analyzed and a possible correction for the bias was proposed.Human serum pools were commutable for all assays; purified analyte preparations were commutable for 2 of the 6 assay pairs; commercial control materials and swine sera were all noncommutable; swine sera showed no reactivity to Vitros assay. The matrix-related biases for noncommutable materials ranged from -83% to 944%. Matrix-related biases of the EQA materials caused major abnormal between-assay variations in the EQA program and correction of the biases normalized the variations.Commutability of materials has major impact on the effectiveness of EQA programs for cTnI measurement. Human serum pools prepared from patient samples are commutable and other materials are mostly noncommutable. EQA programs should include at least one human serum pool to allow proper interpretation of EQA results."

During follow-up, interviews for risk behaviours were taken and blood sampling (HCV-antibody and RNA testing) was performed.Self-reported frequencies of injecting drugs and sharing events, as well as other risk behaviours and details on the nature of injecting events.The best estimate of the per-event probability of infection was 0.57% (CI: 0.32-1.05%). A sensitivity analysis on the likely effect of under-reporting of sharing of the injecting apparatus indicated that the per event infection probability may be as low as 0.17% (95% CI: 0.11%-0.25%). The transmission probability was similarly shown to range up to 6%, dependent on the presumed prevalence of the virus in injecting equipment.The transmission probability of HCV during a sharing event is small. Hence, strategies to reduce the frequency and sharing of injecting equipment are required, as well as interventions focused on decreasing the per event risk."
https://openalex.org/W2071327224,"Muscles can be injured in different ways and the trauma and subsequent loss of function and physical capacity can impact significantly on the lives of patients through physical impairments and compromised quality of life. The relative success of muscle repair after injury will largely determine the extent of functional recovery. Unfortunately, regenerative processes are often slow and incomplete, and so developing novel strategies to enhance muscle regeneration is important. While the capacity to enhance muscle repair by stimulating β2-adrenoceptors (β-ARs) using β2-AR agonists (β2-agonists) has been demonstrated previously, the exact role β-ARs play in regulating the regenerative process remains unclear. To investigate β-AR-mediated signaling in muscle regeneration after myotoxic damage, we examined the regenerative capacity of tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus muscles from mice lacking either β1-AR (β1-KO) and/or β2-ARs (β2-KO), testing the hypothesis that muscles from mice lacking the β2-AR would exhibit impaired functional regeneration after damage compared with muscles from β1-KO or β1/β2-AR null (β1/β2-KO) KO mice. At 7 days post-injury, regenerating muscles from β1/β2-KO mice produced less force than those of controls but muscles from β1-KO or β2-KO mice did not exhibit any delay in functional restoration. Compared with controls, β1/β2-KO mice exhibited an enhanced inflammatory response to injury, which delayed early muscle regeneration, but an enhanced myoblast proliferation later during regeneration ensured a similar functional recovery (to controls) by 14 days post-injury. This apparent redundancy in the β-AR signaling pathway was unexpected and may have important implications for manipulating β-AR signaling to improve the rate, extent and efficacy of muscle regeneration to enhance functional recovery after injury."
https://openalex.org/W2085523566,"Menopause is associated with an increased incidence of insulin resistance and metabolic diseases. In a chronic palmitate treatment model, we investigated the role of skeletal muscle fatty acid exposure in relation to the metabolic deterioration observed with menopause. Human skeletal muscle satellite cells were isolated from premenopausal (n = 6) and postmenopausal (n = 5) women. In an in vitro model, the myotubes were treated with palmitate (300 µM) for one-, two- or three days during differentiation. Effects on lipid accumulation, inflammation and insulin signaling were studied. Palmitate treatment led to a 108% (CI 95%: 50%; 267%) increase in intramyocellular ceramide in the myotubes from the postmenopausal women (post-myotubes) compared with a 26% (CI 95%: -57%; 96%) increase in myotubes from the premenopausal women (pre-myotubes), (p<0.05). Furthermore, post-myotubes had a 22% (CI 95%: 4%; 34%) increase in pJNK (p = 0.04) and a 114% (CI 95%: 50%; 177%) increase in Hsp70 protein expression (p = 0.03) after three days of palmitate treatment, compared with pre-myotubes, in which no increase in either pJNK (-12% (CI 95: -26%; 2%)) or Hsp70 (7% (CI 95: -78%; 91%)) was detected. Furthermore, post-myotubes showed a blunted insulin stimulated phosphorylation of AS160 in response to chronic palmitate treatment compared with pre-myotubes (p = 0.02). The increased intramyocellular ceramide content in the post-myotubes was associated with a significantly higher mRNA expression of Serine Palmitoyltransferase1 (SPT1) after one day of palmitate treatment (p = 0.03) in post-myotubes compared with pre-myotubes. Our findings indicate that post-myotubes are more prone to develop lipid accumulation and defective insulin signaling following chronic saturated fatty acid exposure as compared to pre-myotubes."
https://openalex.org/W2090937873,"Inherited dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by dilatation and dysfunction of the ventricles, and often results in sudden death or heart failure (HF). Although angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been used for the treatment of HF, little is known about the effects on postulated electrical remodeling that occurs in inherited DCM. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of candesartan, one of the ARBs, on cardiac function and electrical remodeling in the hearts of inherited DCM model mice (TNNT2 ΔK210). DCM mice were treated with candesartan in drinking water for 2 months from 1 month of age. Control, non-treated DCM mice showed an enlargement of the heart with prolongation of QRS and QT intervals, and died at t1/2 of 70 days. Candesartan dramatically extended the lifespan of DCM mice, suppressed cardiac dilatation, and improved the functional parameters of the myocardium. It also greatly suppressed prolongation of QRS and QT intervals and action potential duration (APD) in the left ventricular myocardium and occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia. Expression analysis revealed that down-regulation of Kv4.2 (Ito channel protein), KChIP2 (auxiliary subunit of Kv4.2), and Kv1.5 (IKur channel protein) in DCM was partially reversed by candesartan administration. Interestingly, non-treated DCM heart had both normal-sized myocytes with moderately decreased Ito and IKur and enlarged cells with greatly reduced K+ currents (Ito, IKur IK1 and Iss). Treatment with candesartan completely abrogated the emergence of the enlarged cells but did not reverse the Ito, and IKur in normal-sized cells in DCM hearts. Our results indicate that candesartan treatment suppresses structural remodeling to prevent severe electrical remodeling in inherited DCM."
https://openalex.org/W2078463977,"Myocardial scarring can be assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement and by endomyocardial biopsy. However, accuracy of late gadolinium enhancement for predicting microscopic myocardial scarring in biopsied specimens remains unknown in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We investigated whether late gadolinium enhancement in the whole heart reflects microscopic myocardial scarring in the small biopsied specimens in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Twenty-one consecutive patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who were examined both by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and by endomyocardial biopsy were retrospectively studied. The right interventricular septum was the target site for endomyocardial biopsy in all patients. Late gadolinium enhancement in the ventricular septum had an excellent sensitivity (100%) with a low specificity (40%) for predicting microscopic myocardial scarring in biopsied specimens. The sensitivity of late gadolinium enhancement in the whole heart remained 100% with a specificity of 27% for predicting microscopic myocardial scarring in biopsied specimens. Quantitative assessments of fibrosis revealed that the extent of late gadolinium enhancement in the whole heart was the only independent variable related to the microscopic collagen fraction in biopsied specimens (β = 0.59, 95% confident interval: 0.15 - 1.0, p = 0.012).Although there was a compromise in the specificity, the sensitivity of late gadolinium enhancement was excellent for prediction of microscopic myocardial scarring in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Moreover, the severity of late gadolinium enhancement was independently associated with the quantitative collagen fraction in biopsied specimens in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. These findings indicate that late gadolinium enhancement can reflect both the presence and the extent of microscopic myocardial scarring in the small biopsied specimens in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2085881283,"Objective To investigate the role of 188Re in human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) theranostic gene-mediated human glioma imaging and therapy in model mice. Methods The human glioma cell line U87 was transfected with recombinant lentivirus encoding the hNIS gene under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter (U87-hNIS). The uptake and efflux of 188Re were determined after incubating the cells with 188Re. 188Re uptake experiments in the presence of various concentrations of sodium perchlorate were carried out. In vitro cell killing tests with 188Re were performed. U87-hNIS mediated 188Re distribution, imaging and therapy in nude mice were also tested. Results U87-hNIS cell line was successfully established. The uptake of 188Re in U87-hNIS cells increased up to 26-fold compared to control cells, but was released rapidly with a half-life of approximately 4 minutes. Sodium perchlorate reduced hNIS-mediated 188Re uptake to levels of control cell lines. U87-hNIS cells were selectively killed following exposure to 188Re, with a survival of 21.4%, while control cells had a survival of 92.1%. Unlike in vitro studies, U87-hNIS tumor showed a markedly increased 188Re retention even 48 hours after 188Re injection. In the therapy study, there was a significant difference in tumor size between U87-hNIS mice (317±67 mm3) and control mice (861±153 mm3) treated with 188Re for 4 weeks (P<0.01). Conclusion The results indicate that inserting the hNIS gene into U87 cells is sufficient to induce specific 188Re uptake, which has a cell killing effect both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, our study, based on the function of hNIS as a theranostic gene allowing noninvasive imaging of hNIS expression by 188Re scintigraphy, provides detailed characterization of in vivo vector biodistribution and level, localization, essential prerequisites for precise planning and monitoring of clinical gene therapy that aims to individualize gene therapy concept."
https://openalex.org/W2029592085,"Background Selection of drug-resistant strains may lead to failure of HBV antiviral therapy. There is little information whether there is detection difference in drug resistant mutations between different viral load assays of HBV. Objectives This study is aimed to investigate whether there is drug-resistant strains related detection difference between Abbott RealTime HBV (RealTime) and CobasAmpliPrep/CobasTaqMan HBV assays 2.0 (TaqMan). Study Design One hundred and thirty-four CHB patients who received HBV anti-viral therapy were enrolled. HBV virological markers were tested 3 months apart regularly. Serum HBV DNA levels were determined using the TaqMan and RealTime. YMDD (rt180M and rt204V) mutation was checked in patients who experienced virologic breakthrough (VBT). Results The correlation of HBV DNA observed between the RealTime and TaqMan was good for all 571 samples (R2 = 0.797; P<0.001). However, the correlation in the 434 samples with HBV DNA level <3 log10 IU/ml was not as good as in all samples (R2 = 0.457). Overall, 21.5% of samples had a detection difference of ≥1 log10 IU/ml with 91.9% of these having HBV DNA level <3 log10 IU/ml. Twenty-four patients experiencedVBT. Three of these patients had acquired the YMDD mutation and exhibited discordant viral load results between the two methods tested. In each case, persistent HBV DNA was detected by RealTime and undetectable with TaqMan. Of the patients who experienced a VBT and had acquired YMDD mutation, 4.7% had undetectable HBV DNA by TaqMan while all were detectable with RealTime. Conclusions RealTime assay is more sensitive and is little impacted by the development of drug resistant mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2029757123,"The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family member CD40 plays an essential role in the activation of antigen-presenting cells, B cell maturation, and immunoglobulin (Ig) class switching critical for adaptive immunity. Although the bioactive sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and the kinase that produces it, sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), have long been implicated in the actions of TNF mediated by engagement of TNFR1, nothing is yet known of their role in CD40-mediated events. We have now found that ligation of CD40 activates and translocates SphK1 to the plasma membrane, leading to generation of S1P. SphK1 inhibition in human tonsil B cells, as well as inhibition or deletion of SphK1 in mouse splenic B cells, significantly reduced CD40-mediated Ig class switching and plasma cell differentiation ex vivo. Optimal activation of downstream CD40 signaling pathways, including NF-κB, p38, and JNK, also required SphK1. In mice treated with a SphK1 inhibitor or in SphK1–/– mice, isotype switching to antigen-specific IgE was decreased in vivo by 70 and 55%, respectively. Our results indicate that SphK1 is important for CD40-mediated B cell activation and regulation of humoral responses and suggest that targeting SphK1 might be a useful therapeutic approach to control antigen-specific IgE production.—Kim, E.

https://openalex.org/W1996896522,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a ubiquitously expressed receptor tyrosine kinase, is recognized as a key mediator of tumorigenesis in many human epithelial tumors. Erlotinib is tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved by FDA for use in oncology. It inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase associated with the EGFR to restrain the development of the tumor. To investigate the antitumor effect of erlotinib at different dosing times and the underlying molecular mechanism via the PI3K/AKT pathway, we established a mouse model of Lewis lung cancer xenografts. The tumor-bearing mice were housed four or five per cage under standardized light-dark cycle conditions (light on at 7:00 AM, 500 Lux, off at 7:00 PM, 0 Lux) with food and water provided ad libitum. The mice were observed for quality of life, their body weight and tumor volume measured, and the tumor growth curves drawn. After being bled, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The tumor masses were removed at different time points and weighed. The mRNA expression of EGFR, AKT, Cyclin D1 and CDK-4 were assayed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Protein expression levels of AKT, P-AKT and Cyclin D1 were determined by Western blot analysis. The results suggest that erlotinib has a significant antitumor effect on xenografts of non-small cell lung cancer in mice, and its efficacy and toxicity is dependent on the time of day of administration. Its molecular mechanism of action might be related to the EGFR-AKT-Cyclin D1-CDK-4 pathway which plays a crucial role in the development of pathology. Therefore, our findings suggest that the time of day of administration of Erlotinib may be a clinically important variable."
https://openalex.org/W2049431738,"Protein C Inhibitor (PCI) is a secreted serine protease inhibitor, belonging to the family of serpins. In addition to activated protein C PCI inactivates several other proteases of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, suggesting a regulatory role in hemostasis. Glycosaminoglycans and certain negatively charged phospholipids, like phosphatidylserine, bind to PCI and modulate its activity. Phosphatidylerine (PS) is exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells and known as a phagocytosis marker. We hypothesized that PCI might bind to PS exposed on apoptotic cells and thereby influence their removal by phagocytosis. Using Jurkat T-lymphocytes and U937 myeloid cells, we show here that PCI binds to apoptotic cells to a similar extent at the same sites as Annexin V, but in a different manner as compared to live cells (defined spots on ∼10-30% of cells). PCI dose dependently decreased phagocytosis of apoptotic Jurkat cells by U937 macrophages. Moreover, the phagocytosis of PS exposing, activated platelets by human blood derived monocytes declined in the presence of PCI. In U937 cells the expression of PCI as well as the surface binding of PCI increased with time of phorbol ester treatment/macrophage differentiation. The results of this study suggest a role of PCI not only for the function and/or maturation of macrophages, but also as a negative regulator of apoptotic cell and activated platelets removal."

Emotional distress was reported in a short form of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (SCL-5) at 17 and 30 weeks of gestation. Gestational length at birth, obtained from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, was used as continuous (gestational length in days) and categorized (early preterm (22-31 weeks) and late preterm (32-36 weeks) versus term birth (≥ 37 weeks)) outcome, using linear and logistic regression analysis, respectively. Births were divided into spontaneous and provider-initiated.Of all women, 7.4% reported emotional distress at 17 weeks, 6.0% at 30 weeks and 5.1% had a preterm birth. All measurements of emotional distress at 30 weeks were significantly associated with a reduction of gestational length, in days, for provider-initiated births at term. Emotional distress at 30 weeks showed a reduced duration of pregnancy at birth of 2.40 days for provider-initiated births at term. An increase in emotional distress from 17 to 30 weeks was associated with a reduction of gestational length at birth of 2.13 days for provider-initiated births at term. Sustained high emotional distress was associated with a reduction of gestational length at birth of 2.82 days for provider-initiated births. Emotional distress did not increase the risk of either early or late preterm birth.Emotional distress at 30 weeks, an increase in emotional distress from 17 to 30 weeks and sustained high levels of emotional distress were associated with a reduction in gestational length in days for provider-initiated term birth. We found no significant association between emotional distress and the risk of preterm birth."
https://openalex.org/W1965928294,"Background In line with the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the Morocco health surveillance system has been reinforced via infrastructure strengthening and decentralization in its regions. To plan for personnel capacity reinforcement actions, a national workforce needs assessment was conducted by the National Epidemiological Surveillance Service and the World Health Organization. Methods The assessment used an ad-hoc method comprising two stages: (1) A survey via a standardized electronic questionnaire, administered to all staff in regional and provincial surveillance teams. Data collected included demographics, basic qualification, complementary training, perceived training needs, and preferred training modalities. Individuals were asked to grade, on a nine-point scale, their perception of importance of a given list of tasks and of their capacity to perform them. The gap between perceptions was quantified and described. (2) Field visits to national, regional and provincial sites for direct observation and opinion gathering on broader issues such as motivators, barriers, and training needs from the local perspective. Results Questionnaire respondents were 122/158 agents at 78 surveillance units countrywide. Mean age was 43.6 years and job longevity 5.7 years. Only 53% (65/122) had epidemiology training, posted in 62% (48/78) of the structures. Self-assessed capacity varied by basic qualification and by structure level (regional vs. provincial). The gap between the importance granted to a task and the perceived capacity to perform it was sizable, showing an uneven distribution across competency domains, regions, surveillance level and staff's basic qualification. From the opinions gathered, a problem of staff demotivation and high turnover emerged clearly. Conclusions Our method was successful in revealing specific details of the training needs countrywide. A national strategy is needed to ensure rational planning of training, personnel motivation and long-term sustainability. In terms of training, an innovative program should target the specific needs per group and per region."
