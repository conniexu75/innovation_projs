https://openalex.org/W2076086205,"The mechanical environment crucially influences many cell functions. However, it remains largely mysterious how mechanical stimuli are transmitted into biochemical signals. Src is known to regulate the integrin-cytoskeleton interaction, which is essential for the transduction of mechanical stimuli. Using fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET), here we develop a genetically encoded Src reporter that enables the imaging and quantification of spatio-temporal activation of Src in live cells. We introduced a local mechanical stimulation to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by applying laser-tweezer traction on fibronectin-coated beads adhering to the cells. Using the Src reporter, we observed a rapid distal Src activation and a slower directional wave propagation of Src activation along the plasma membrane. This wave propagated away from the stimulation site with a speed (mean +/- s.e.m.) of 18.1 +/- 1.7 nm s(-1). This force-induced directional and long-range activation of Src was abolished by the disruption of actin filaments or microtubules. Our reporter has thus made it possible to monitor mechanotransduction in live cells with spatio-temporal characterization. We find that the transmission of mechanically induced Src activation is a dynamic process that directs signals via the cytoskeleton to spatial destinations."

https://openalex.org/W2064442671,"The finding of orexin/hypocretin deficiency in narcolepsy patients suggests that this hypothalamic neuropeptide plays a crucial role in regulating sleep/wakefulness states. However, very little is known about the synaptic input of orexin/hypocretin-producing neurons (orexin neurons). We applied a transgenic method to map upstream neuronal populations that have synaptic connections to orexin neurons and revealed that orexin neurons receive input from several brain areas. These include the amygdala, basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area, and serotonergic neurons in the median/paramedian raphe nuclei. Monoamine-containing groups that are innervated by orexin neurons do not receive reciprocal connections, while cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain have reciprocal connections, which might be important for consolidating wakefulness. Electrophysiological study showed that carbachol excites almost one-third of orexin neurons and inhibits a small population of orexin neurons. These neuroanatomical findings provide important insights into the neural pathways that regulate sleep/wakefulness states."

https://openalex.org/W1974931752,"Ephrin signaling through Eph receptor tyrosine kinases can promote attraction or repulsion of axonal growth cones during development. However, the mechanisms that determine whether Eph signaling promotes attraction or repulsion are not known. We show here that the Rho family GEF Vav2 plays a key role in this process. We find that, during axon guidance, ephrin binding to Ephs triggers Vav-dependent endocytosis of the ligand-receptor complex, thus converting an initially adhesive interaction into a repulsive event. In the absence of Vav proteins, ephrin-Eph endocytosis is blocked, leading to defects in growth cone collapse in vitro and significant defects in the ipsilateral retinogeniculate projections in vivo. These findings suggest an important role for Vav family GEFs as regulators of ligand-receptor endocytosis and determinants of repulsive signaling during axon guidance."
https://openalex.org/W2012334457,"Wnt signaling has been reported to block apoptosis and regulate differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 and stabilization of β-catenin. The effects of Wnt in preadipocytes may be mediated through Frizzled (Fz) 1 and/or Fz2 as these Wnt receptors are expressed in preadipocytes and their expression declines upon induction of differentiation. We ectopically expressed constitutively active chimeras between Wnt8 and Fz1 or Fz2 in preadipocytes and mesenchymal precursor cells. Our results indicated that activated Fz1 increases stability of β-catenin, inhibits apoptosis, induces osteoblastogenesis, and inhibits adipogenesis. Although activated Fz2 does not influence apoptosis or osteoblastogenesis, it inhibits adipogenesis through a mechanism independent of β-catenin. An important mediator of the β-catenin-independent pathway appears to be calcineurin because inhibitors of this serine/threonine phosphatase partially rescue the block to adipogenesis caused by Wnt3a or activated Fz2. These data supported a model in which Wnt signaling inhibits adipogenesis through both β-catenin-dependent and β-catenin-independent mechanisms.

https://openalex.org/W2003701228,"NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are heteromeric assemblies of NR1 and NR2(A-D) subunits with properties heavily influenced by the type of NR2 subunit incorporated. While NMDARs with only one type of NR2 subunit have been extensively characterized, little is known about receptors containing two different NR2 subunits, despite compelling evidence that such triheteromeric receptors exist in vivo. We used a point-mutation approach that allows isolation of recombinant triheteromeric NMDARs possessing two different NR2 N-terminal domains (NTDs). We show that in receptors associating the NR2A-NTD (sensing nanomolar Zn) and the NR2B-NTD (sensing ifenprodil), each NTD binding site retains selective high affinity for its ligand. However, each ligand produces only partial inhibition, and maximal inhibition requires occupancy of both NR2-NTDs by their respective ligands. Similarly, NR1/2A/2C receptors are inhibited by zinc with high potency but low efficacy. Therefore, interactions between homologous N-terminal domains determine the unique pharmacological properties of triheteromeric NMDARs."
https://openalex.org/W2001419142,"Certain goal-directed behaviors depend upon interactions between basolateral amygdala (ABL) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Here we describe neurophysiological evidence of this cooperative function. We recorded from ABL in intact and OFC-lesioned rats during learning of odor discrimination problems and reversals. During learning, rats with ipsilateral OFC lesions exhibited a marked decline in the proportion of ABL neurons that fired differentially during cue sampling both before and after reversal and in the proportion of neurons that reversed odor preference when the odor-outcome associations were reversed. This decline appeared to reflect a loss of rapid flexibility in cue selectivity that characterized activity in intact rats. In addition, lesioned rats had fewer neurons that fired in anticipation of the predicted outcome during a delay period after responding but before outcome delivery. These findings support a role for OFC in facilitating the encoding of information about expected outcomes in ABL."

The neuronal basis of plasticity mediating cortical map reorganization is not fully understood, but recent studies have indicated that the basal forebrain cholinergic system may play an essential role in this process. Cholinergic mechanisms have been clearly implicated as a necessary substrate for the reorganization of cortical representations following manipulations of peripheral sensory inputs (Baskerville et al., 1997Baskerville K.A.

Recent studies have also demonstrated that the basal forebrain cholinergic system is essential for enabling cortical reorganization associated with normal motor learning (Conner et al., 2003Conner J.M. Culberson A. Packowski C. Chiba A.A. Tuszynski M.H.

These results led us to hypothesize that the basal forebrain cholinergic system may also play a critical role in enabling cortical reorganization required for functional recovery following nervous system injury. Forty-five adult male F344 rats (225–250 g starting weight) were used in this study. The basic experimental design used to test the hypothesis that basal forebrain cholinergic mechanisms play a critical role in mediating cortical reorganization required for functional recovery after nervous system injury is shown in Figure 1A . Additional groups of animals were included in the experimental design (1) to distinguish the relative contributions of the motor cortex lesion versus the rehabilitative training in mediating cortical plasticity within the rostral forelimb area and (2) to assess the contribution of the rostral forelimb area in mediating skilled forelimb reaching in normal (unlesioned) animals and following motor cortex injury and rehabilitative training. To assess the role of the basal forebrain cholinergic system in mediating functional recovery after nervous system injury, rats (n = 33) were initially trained to perform a skilled forelimb reaching task (Conner et al., 2003Conner J.M. Culberson A. Packowski C. Chiba A.A. Tuszynski M.H.

Loss of the innate cortical engram for action patterns used in skilled reaching and the development of behavioral compensation following motor cortex lesions in the rat.Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 788-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). After the reaching behavior was acquired, rats were divided into two groups, matched on the basis of learning performance (p = 0.96 between groups; repeated-measures ANOVA, treatment × time). One group of animals (n = 17) received bilateral injections of the cholinergic-specific immunotoxin 192-IgG-saporin (SAP) into the nucleus basalis and substantia inominata to remove afferent cholinergic innervation to motor and sensory cortices. The remaining rats received comparable injections of vehicle. Two weeks later, all rats were retested to establish each animal’s “prelesion performance” (defined as the mean reaching accuracy over the 5 days prior to receiving a motor cortex lesion). All animals then received focal cortical lesions, specifically targeting sites associated with the control of distal forelimb movements (Figure 1, Figure 3). Following 2 weeks of recovery from the motor cortex lesions, rats underwent daily rehabilitative reach training for 5 weeks. Prior studies have demonstrated that rehabilitative training contributes significantly to functional recovery following focal brain injury (Chen et al., 2002Chen R. Cohen L.G. Hallett M. Nervous system reorganization following injury.Neuroscience. 2002; 111: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, Johansson, 2000Johansson B.B. Brain plasticity and stroke rehabilitation.

SiFuentes F Neural substrates for the effects of rehabilitative training on motor recovery after ischemic infarct.Science. 1996; 272: 1791-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the deficit induced by the motor cortex lesion was assessed in each animal by comparing its reaching accuracy during the first 3 days of rehabilitative testing (“postlesion performance”) relative to its prelesion performance. The percent deficit was calculated as follows:%Deficit=(Prelesion – Postlesion)Prelesion×100Group comparisons indicated that initial deficits in reaching performance induced by the motor cortex lesion were identical in vehicle and SAP-injected groups (Figure 1C). Functional recovery from the motor cortex injury was then evaluated over the course of 5 weeks of “rehabilitative” training. The absolute recovery for each animal was calculated on a weekly basis as follows:Recovery (X) = mean accuracy (X) − Postlesion performance. To account for possible differences in the initial reaching performance and/or the magnitude of the lesion-induced deficit between individual animals, the extent of functional recovery was normalized to reflect the percentage of each animal’s initial deficit reversed over the course of rehabilitative testing and was defined as follows:%Recovery(forweekX)=Recovery(forweekX)Deficit×100Over the 5 week rehabilitation training period, vehicle-injected animals recovered 55.2% ± 4.4% of their reaching deficit (Figure 2). Animals lacking a basal forebrain cholinergic system were significantly impaired relative to control animals, achieving only 18.1% ± 7.6% recovery over the 5 week period (ANOVA, p = 0.0015). These results indicate that basal forebrain cholinergic mechanisms play a critical role in the process of functional recovery following cortical injury. To assess cortical plasticity associated with functional recovery following the motor cortex lesion, intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) techniques were applied (Conner et al., 2003Conner J.M. Culberson A. Packowski C. Chiba A.A. Tuszynski M.H. Lesions of the basal forebrain cholinergic system impair task acquisition and abolish cortical plasticity associated with motor skill learning.Neuron. 2003; 38: 819-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Functional mapping revealed significant reorganization of motor representations following the motor cortex lesion and rehabilitative training. One aspect of cortical plasticity involved the lateral expansion of the vibrissa representation into the adjacent region that is typically associated with movements of the caudal forelimb (see Figures 3B, 3C, and 3E ). Plasticity of the vibrissa area was assessed using two approaches. The first measured the centroid of the vibrissa representation with respect to the midline. A lateral expansion of the vibrissa area would be expected to shift the centroid away from the midline. As shown in Figure 3E, all motor cortex-lesioned animals (SAP and vehicle injected) had a significant lateral shift in the vibrissa area centroid (relative to unlesioned controls), indicating that reorganization of the vibrissa representation was “cholinergic independent.” Since plasticity in the rostral forelimb area may impinge upon the more medial vibrissa area (possibly displacing the centroid laterally), we also measured the absolute number of vibrissa-responsive sites >2.5 mm lateral to the midline. By assessing only lateral vibrissa sites, the impact of the rostral forelimb area plasticity is minimized. This second analysis confirmed results from the centroid approach, indicating that all motor cortex-lesioned animals (SAP and vehicle injected) had a significant increase in the number of responsive sites >2.5 mm lateral to the midline (overall ANOVA, p < 0.0001; post hoc Fisher’s test comparing unlesioned animals to SAP-injected and vehicle-injected animals, p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). The second facet of cortical plasticity identified by the mapping studies was an expansion of the rostral forelimb area (Figures 3B and 3D). Vehicle-injected animals, which showed marked functional recovery following a focal motor cortex lesion, had a significant 48.6% ± 12.2% increase in the size of the rostral forelimb area relative to unlesioned control animals (p < 0.02, Fisher’s post hoc analysis). In contrast, the rostral forelimb area in animals lacking a basal forebrain cholinergic system did not expand after motor cortex lesions, indicating that plasticity of the rostral forelimb area following focal cortical lesions and rehabilitative training is “cholinergic dependent.” These results indicate that basal forebrain cholinergic mechanisms are required for the expansion of the rostral forelimb area and suggest that the expansion of the rostral forelimb area may underlie the functional recovery. To confirm that the expanded rostral forelimb area was mediating the recovered skilled reaching behavior, additional experiments were performed. Following functional mapping, a subset of vehicle-injected rats that had previously received motor cortex lesions and rehabilitative training were reassessed in the reaching task to confirm that the behavior was intact (not impaired by the mapping procedure; n = 7). In four animals, the rostral forelimb area was subsequently localized using ICMS techniques and ablated by electrolytic lesion. In the three remaining rats, a “control” lesion was placed within the hindlimb region of the motor cortex, also localized by ICMS techniques. Following 2 weeks of recovery, all animals were retested in the skilled reaching task for an additional 10 days. Animals with secondary lesions of the hindlimb area showed no significant loss in reaching accuracy relative to their prelesion performance (Figure 4). However, animals with selective lesions of the reorganized rostral forelimb area showed a complete loss of the recovered reaching performance. Importantly, the contribution of the rostral forelimb area to mediating skilled reaching in otherwise intact animals is currently unknown. To investigate this question, six additional rats were trained to perform the skilled reaching behavior. After the behavior was acquired, the rostral forelimb area was localized using ICMS techniques and ablated by passing 1 mA DC current for 20 s. Following 2 weeks recovery, all rats were reevaluated for skilled reaching performance. Results indicate that reaching accuracy is not reduced by lesions of the rostral forelimb area when given to otherwise intact animals (prelesion reaching accuracy [average of last 3 days prior to lesion] = 69.7% ± 2.08%, postlesion reaching accuracy [average of last 3 days of first week following the lesion] = 69.1% ± 2.65%; p = 0.73, paired t test). Moreover, subsequent ICMS mapping procedures confirmed the absence of the rostral forelimb area in all animals and the presence of a nonresponsive zone corresponding to the lesion site. No other significant plasticity was noted in rats receiving lesions of only the rostral forelimb area. Together, these data indicate that although the rostral forelimb area is normally not required for skilled reaching, the expanded rostral forelimb area is essential for mediating functional recovery following an initial focal cortical lesion within the caudal forelimb area. Finally, while prior studies have indicated that rehabilitative training is critical for mediating functional recovery following a focal cortical injury (Chen et al., 2002Chen R. Cohen L.G. Hallett M. Nervous system reorganization following injury.Neuroscience. 2002; 111: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, Johansson, 2000Johansson B.B.

To investigate the role of the cortical lesion versus rehabilitative training in mediating cortical map plasticity, additional animals (n = 6) were given motor cortex lesions, but did not undergo rehabilitative training. After 7 weeks (equivalent to 2 weeks recovery + 5 weeks training), the rats were mapped using ICMS techniques. The rostral forelimb area in motor cortex-lesioned animals undergoing rehabilitative training was significantly larger than the rostral forelimb area in motor cortex-lesioned animals without training (p = 0.05, post hoc Fisher’s test). In addition, animals receiving motor cortex lesions but not undergoing rehabilitative training did not show a significant increase in the size of the rostral forelimb area relative to unlesioned rats (p = 0.59; post hoc Fisher’s test). Taken together, these data indicate that the rehabilitative training was required to mediate the cholinergic-dependent plasticity within the rostral forelimb area (Figure 3D). In contrast, the lateral expansion of the vibrissa representation occurred to a similar extent in all motor cortex-lesioned rats, with or without rehabilitative training (Figure 3E), indicating that the training was not required to induce the cholinergic-independent expansion of the vibrissa representation. Reorganization of cortical motor representations has been identified in association with functional recovery following stroke (Green, 2003Green J.B. Brain reorganization after stroke.Top. Stroke Rehabil. 2003; 10: 1-20PubMed Google Scholar), traumatic brain injury (Jang et al., 2002Jang S.H. Han B.S. Chang Y. Byun W.M. Lee J. Ahn S.H.

These findings have led to the hypothesis that plasticity of cortical representations may serve as the basis for mediating functional recovery after nervous system injury. Identifying neuronal mechanisms underlying the reorganization of cortical representations will likely be an important precursor for designing therapeutic strategies to enhance functional recovery following nervous system injury. The present study makes a significant contribution toward this goal by identifying the basal forebrain cholinergic system as an essential substrate in mediating cortical plasticity and functional recovery following focal cortical injury. Potential caveats are associated with using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) techniques to assess cortical motor plasticity. Whereas this technique is sensitive to such factors as depth of anesthesia and limb position, every effort was made in the present study to control these factors across animals. More importantly, while movement thresholds can vary significantly as a function of anesthetic state, movement “types” (the specific limb segment that moves) elicited by a minimal threshold stimulus remains relatively consistent. In the present investigation, all measures of plasticity utilized movement types rather than thresholds. In addition, the ICMS technique has been used extensively by others to reliably quantify the effects of both motor experience and damage on the functional organization of motor cortex (Castro-Alamancos and Borrel, 1995Castro-Alamancos M.A. Borrel J.

Our data are consistent with results from other laboratories supporting the reliability and consistency of the mapping technique for investigating cortical plasticity. The focal injury paradigm used in the present study was associated with extensive reorganization within the remaining, unlesioned motor cortex. One aspect of cortical reorganization, which was observed only in animals with an intact basal forebrain cholinergic system (cholinergic dependent), was the expansion of the rostral forelimb area seen following a motor cortex lesion and rehabilitative training. Functional recovery was significantly greater in animals exhibiting this cholinergic-dependent form of cortical plasticity, and subsequent ablation of the expanded rostral forelimb area completely abolished the recovered function. Together, these findings strongly implicate the cholinergic-dependent plasticity within the rostral forelimb area as an essential substrate for the functional recovery. The precise mechanism by which the basal forebrain cholinergic system contributes to this aspect of cortical plasticity is not known. It appears unlikely that cholinergic depletion leads to generalized cortical dysfunction because animals with selective immunotoxic lesions of the Ch4 cholinergic cell population show no impairments on other behaviors that utilize cortical processing (Baxter, 2001Baxter M.G.

Cognitive functions of the basal forebrain.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Specific corticopetal cholinergic lesions do not impair primary sensory processing or discriminative abilities (Chiba et al., 1999Chiba A.A. Bushnell P.J. Oshiro W.M. Gallagher M.

We studied electrophysiological and affective correlates of learned safety by negatively correlating an auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) with aversive events (US). This CS came to signify a period of protection, reducing fear responses to predictors of the US and increasing adventurous exploration of a novel environment. In nonaversive conditions, mice turn on the CS when given the opportunity. Thus, conditioned safety involves a reduction of learned and instinctive fear, as well as positive affective responses. Concurrent electrophysiological measurements identified a safety learning-induced long-lasting depression of CS-evoked activity in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, consistent with fear reduction, and an increase of CS-evoked activity in a region of the striatum involved in positive affect, euphoric responses, and reward.

Concurrent electrophysiological measurements identified a safety learning-induced long-lasting depression of CS-evoked activity in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, consistent with fear reduction, and an increase of CS-evoked activity in a region of the striatum involved in positive affect, euphoric responses, and reward. The behavioral analysis of learned safety began with Pavlov’s studies of “behavioral inhibition,” a concept refined by Rescorla as “conditioned inhibition,” whereby a neutral CS develops the ability to inhibit responses to learned predictors of aversive or rewarding stimuli (Pavlov, 1927Pavlov I.P. Conditioned Reflexes. New York, Dover1927Google Scholar, Rescorla, 1969Rescorla R.A. Pavlovian conditioned inhibition.Psychol. Bull. 1969; 72: 77-94Crossref Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Within this framework, learned safety is a special case of conditioned inhibition characterized by the reduction of conditioned fear responses by a signal that has been negatively correlated with aversive events. However, the effect of such safety signals is not limited to action on conditioned fear. Learned safety signals can also be used to reward or otherwise facilitate operant behavior (Hendry, 1969Hendry D.P. Conditioned inhibition of conditioned suppression.Psychonomic Society. 1969; 9: 261-262Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, Lolordo, 1969Lolordo V.M.

Conditioning of fear and conditioning of safety in rats.Acta Neurobiol. Exp. (Warsz.). 1995; 55: 121-132PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that safety signals may be associated with positive affective states. These complementary findings lead us to approach safety learning as evidence of an adaptive ability to detect and exploit new sources of security or shelter in the environment, a function related to but distinct from the well-studied ability to learn about new dangers as examined with fear conditioning. That is, we suggest that the safety conditioned animal learns not only about the absence of danger, but also about the presence of protection from danger, which, like the shelter of the nest, is a positively valenced environmental feature. Indeed, like safety signals, access to the shelter of the home cage can be used to reward or facilitate behavior (Ganguly and Kleinfeld, 2004Ganguly K. Kleinfeld D.

Rats prefer the home cage to the runway following intermittent but not consistent reinforcement.Nature. 1968; 217: 288-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). From this perspective, it can be expected that safety conditioning and fear conditioning are subserved by related but independent neural substrates. Further, in much the same way that emotions such as fear and anxiety are associated with the operation of defense systems that can be driven by fear conditioning (LeDoux, 2000LeDoux J.E. Emotion circuits in the brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (5778) Google Scholar), we expect that positive affective states are associated with conditions of safety and security and may be made accessible to neurobiological study using safety conditioning. The selection of brain regions for an electrophysiological study of learning-induced changes in safety CS processing was guided by the known functionality of candidate regions and connectivity of those regions with related CS processing circuits. The fact that safety signals reduce conditioned fear responses (Grillon and Ameli, 2001Grillon C. Ameli R.

The nature of conditioned anti-analgesia: spinal cord opiate and anti-opiate neurochemistry.Brain Res. 1994; 634: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) indicates an interaction with the neural circuitry underlying fear conditioning, of which the amygdala is a key structure (Davis and Whalen, 2001Davis M. Whalen P.J. The amygdala: vigilance and emotion.Mol. Psychiatry. 2001; 6: 13-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar, LeDoux, 2000LeDoux J.E. Emotion circuits in the brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (5778) Google Scholar). The amygdala is also involved in the modulation of emotional memories (McGaugh, 2004McGaugh J.L. The amygdala modulates the consolidation of memories of emotionally arousing experiences.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). The lateral nucleus (LA) is the primary sensory input site of the amygdala and has been identified as a site of neural plasticity associated with the acquisition of contingency information about danger, evidenced by an increased amygdala response to a fear conditioned CS (Quirk et al., 1995Quirk G.J.

Shinnick-Gallagher P. Fear conditioning induces a lasting potentiation of synaptic currents in vitro.Nature. 1997; 390: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The neural pathways that are essential for transmission of auditory CS information in fear conditioning have been delineated in some detail, but little is known about the pathways for CS information used in safety conditioning. However, it has been recently reported that lesions of the posterior intralaminar nucleus (PIN) of the thalamus disrupt conditioned inhibition of learned fear (Waddell et al., 2003Waddell J. Heldt S. Falls W.A. Posttraining lesion of the superior colliculus interferes with feature-negative discrimination of fear-potentiated startle.Behav. Brain Res. 2003; 142: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This nucleus, along with the overlying medial division of the medial geniculate (MGm), is also the source of the direct thalamo-LA projection of auditory fear CS information (Romanski and LeDoux, 1992Romanski L.M. LeDoux J.E. Equipotentiality of thalamo-amygdala and thalamo-cortico-amygdala circuits in auditory fear conditioning.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4501-4509PubMed Google Scholar). The MGm/PIN sends monosynaptic projections to LA as well as to the portion of the dorsal striatum (caudoputamen—CP in rodents) that lies immediately dorsal to LA (Clugnet et al., 1990Clugnet M.C. LeDoux J.E. Morrison S.F. Unit responses evoked in the amygdala and striatum by electrical stimulation of the medial geniculate body.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1055-1061PubMed Google Scholar, Rogan and LeDoux, 1995Rogan M.T. LeDoux J.E. LTP is accompanied by commensurate enhancement of auditory - evoked responses in a fear conditioning circuit.Neuron. 1995; 15: 127-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This extreme caudal area of the CP is embedded in neural circuitry that includes the lateral amygdala and virtually all structures involved in auditory CS and footshock US processing in fear conditioning. Auditory, footshock, and somatosensory information converge on single neurons in both LA and the caudal CP (Chudler et al., 1995Chudler E.H. Sugiyama K. Dong W.K. Multisensory convergence and integration in the neostriatum and globus pallidus of the rat.Brain Res. 1995; 674: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Romanski et al., 1993Romanski L.M. Clugnet M.C. Bordi F. LeDoux J.E. Somatosensory and auditory convergence in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala.Behav. Neurosci. 1993; 107: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Despite this strategic connectivity, lesion studies have shown that this region of CP is not essential for fear conditioning (Iwata et al., 1986Iwata J. LeDoux J.E. Meeley M.P. Arneric S. Reis D.J. Intrinsic neurons in the amygdaloid field projected to by the medial geniculate body mediate emotional responses conditioned to acoustic stimuli.Brain Res. 1986; 383: 195-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The caudoputamen is however a candidate for processing safety conditioning information, as it is implicated in a range of sensory, motor, and motivational processes including reward and positive affect processing. Indeed, exposure to a compound of the safety signal and a fear CS increased C-fos immunoreactivity in CP of rat brains (Campeau et al., 1997Campeau S. Falls W.A. Cullinan W.E. Helmreich D.L. Davis M. Watson S.J. Elicitation and reduction of fear: behavioural and neuroendocrine indices and brain induction of the immediate-early gene c-fos.Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). While there isn’t much data specifically addressing the extreme caudal region of CP, neural activity in corresponding postcommissural regions of the human dorsal striatum correlates positively with ratings of cocaine-induced euphoria (Martinez et al., 2004Martinez D. Broft A. Foltin R.W. Slifstein M. Hwang D.R. Huang Y. Perez A. Frankel W.G. Cooper T. Kleber H.D. et al.Cocaine dependence and d2 receptor availability in the functional subdivisions of the striatum: relationship with cocaine-seeking behavior.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2004; 29: 1190-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether fear conditioning and safety conditioning differentially affected CS processing in LA and CP, focusing on CS transmission to these structures from the MGm/PIN of the thalamus. To determine whether our safety conditioning parameters produced shelter-like protective and/or positive affective properties beyond the expected reduction of conditioned fear, we examined the effects of safety signals, in the absence of conditioned fear, using assays sensitive to positive modulation of behavior. To allow for future molecular genetic analysis of safety signals in the brain, we turned to mice and applied a simple safety conditioning protocol using an auditory CS that was explicitly unpaired with a mildly aversive shock US (Figure 1A ). Over 6 days of training and testing, this protocol produced robust safety conditioning: the arrival of the safety CS significantly reduced the expression of defense responses to the experimental context, indicating that the safety CS confers protection from the US predicted by the mouse’s presence in the conditioning box. This constitutes a summation test of conditioned inhibition of learned defense responses (Rescorla, 1971Rescorla R.A. Summation and retardation tests of latent inhibition.J. Comp. Physiol. Psychol. 1971; 75: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, Williams et al., 1992Williams D.A. Overmier J.B. LoLordo V.M. A reevaluation of Rescorla’s early dictums about pavlovian conditioned inhibition.Psychol. Bull. 1992; 111: 275-290Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To rule out attentional or simple excitatory effects of the CS, we performed the retardation test proposed by Rescorla and found that our safety CS was indeed retarded in subsequent acquisition of fear conditioning (Figure 2C ). By contrast, after fear conditioning (Figure 1B), in which the US immediately follows every occurrence of the CS, the arrival of the CS increases freezing significantly beyond contextual freezing levels, as it signals the arrival of the US.Figure 2Learned and Unlearned Safety Signals Release Exploratory BehaviorShow full caption(A) and (B) show the paths taken by representative mice in an open field during 1 min periods (left).

In terms of affective state, these data are typically interpreted as evidence of a safety signal-induced reduction of the conditioned fear caused by the predictor of shock (context). To investigate other effects of the safety CS, we measured its effect on exploratory behavior in the absence of conditioned fear (Figure 2). To better characterize learned safety responses, we compared them to the effect of an unlearned or instinctive safety signal: reduced illumination. Like learned safety signals, differences in ambient illumination can also modulate fear responses (Walker and Davis, 2002Walker D.L. Davis M. Light-enhanced startle: further pharmacological and behavioral characterization.Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 2002; 159: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mice were randomly assigned to one of four “prior training” groups or to one of three untrained groups. Prior training groups received 2 days of training in the conditioning box prior to open-field exposure: fear conditioned (n = 9), safety conditioned (n = 11), US-alone (n = 8), or handled only (n = 11). On the following day, trained mice explored the open field for 1 min before the CS was turned on for 1 min. Mice from untrained groups explored the open field for 1 min, and then ambient illumination was increased (Brighter, 413 lux: n = 15), decreased (Dimmer, 1 lux: n = 20) or left unchanged (no change, 37 lux: n = 20) for 1 min. Mice stereotypically hug the walls in an open field (thigmotaxis), thereby limiting exposure to predators, and make only occasional runs into the exposed center where foraging may be expected to be more successful (Figure 2A). We found that, only for safety conditioned mice, playing the CS produced a dramatic increase in adventurous exploration of the exposed center of the field compared to the pre-CS period (Figure 2B). Group data (Figure 2C) show that the safety CS did not increase the overall distance traveled compared to the pre-CS period. Rather, it brought the mouse preferentially from the periphery into the exposed center of the open field, behavior consistent with an adaptive exploitation of protection conferred by the safety CS. Mice also moved into the center of the open field under cover of acutely dimmed ambient illumination, suggesting that both learned and unlearned safety signals release similar behavior patterns and may share response mechanisms. By analogy to the conditioned inhibition of learned fear that results from the same training (Figure 1), the affective corollary of the increase of risky exploratory behavior by the safety CS, compared with the pre-CS period, may be interpreted most parsimoniously as a reduction of an unlearned or instinctive fear of novel open spaces. However, the fact that the safety CS evokes adventurous behavior in safety trained mice that is greater than that exhibited by naive unshocked mice also suggests a positive affective modulation of normal baseline mood such as may underlie the rewarding properties of safety signals. For example, open-field behavior is positively modulated by classic anxiolytic drugs and also by what are typically considered euphorigenic drugs. There is no a priori expectation that fear reduction and positive affective responses could not coexist, and in fact, our electrophysiological measurements of CS processing during and after safety conditioning provided evidence for the involvement of distinct anxiolytic and euphorigenic processes. To more directly test for possible positive affective or euphorigenic properties of the safety CS, we developed an assay (“CS preference”) of spontaneous locomotor behavior designed to eliminate the two main aversive characteristics of the open field: novelty and open exposure as evidenced by thigmotaxis. We measured a mouse’s preference for the safety CS by allowing it to choose between a familiar room in which the safety signal plays and a communicating equally familiar silent room. On the day after completing safety conditioning or CS tone training, mice explored a rectangular arena consisting of two adjacent rooms connected by an open doorway. During the first 5 min of habituation to the arena, the animal showed no preference for either room and no thigmotaxic behavior, presumably due to the small size and home-cage illumination of the rooms (Figure 3A ). At the end of 5 min, the CS was turned on, and the room occupied by the animal at that point was designated as the “CS room.” For the next 5 min of training, the animal learned that crossing the threshold into the CS room triggered a continuous presentation of the CS and that leaving the room turned the CS off. Thus, the animal could control how much time it listened to the CS. On the following day, group data show that while all mice continue to visit both rooms, safety trained mice spent roughly 80% of their time listening to the CS in the CS room for the first 3 min (Figure 3B). This demonstration of the “attractiveness” of the safety CS identifies it as having reward value and supports the contention that the safety CS induces a positive affective state. The decay of preference over time may reflect a habituation or an extinction-like process or may simply reflect a competing motivation for exploration. How is this safety signal mediated in the brain? To address this question we first characterized auditory CS-evoked field potentials in the lateral amygdala and caudoputamen (Figure 4) as an index of CS processing, because, unlike single-unit recordings, they can be reliably measured in behaving animals over weeks. Since field potentials are volume conducted and in some cases can be measured at locations distant from the neural populations that generated them (Leung, 1990Leung L.S. Field potentials in the central nervous system: recording, analysis, and modeling.in: Boulton A.A. Baker G.B. Vanderwolf C.H.

Schachner M. Didyatev A. Potentiated amygdaloid auditory-evoked potentials and freezing behavior after fear conditioning in mice.Brain Res. 2001; 919: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it is necessary to establish in the mouse that CS-evoked field potentials measured from electrode positions within LA or CP are generated by neurons within those structures. We further characterized these CS-evoked field potentials with respect to the contribution of CS information transmitted from the MGm/PIN region and auditory cortex. Following methods developed in studies of fear conditioning in the rat (Rogan and LeDoux, 1995Rogan M.T. LeDoux J.E.

As in the rat, anesthesia did not affect the latencies of CS-evoked neural activity. Acute recordings of CS-evoked multiunit activity and field potentials were obtained in LA, CP, and sources of monosynaptic projections of auditory CS information to LA and CP, the MGm/PIN, and auditory cortical area TE3 (LeDoux et al., 1991LeDoux J.E.

The transmission speeds of CS information via direct thalamic and thalamocortical projections to LA and CP were estimated by combining measures of CS-evoked multiunit activity in MGm/PIN and TE3 with measures of multiunit activity evoked in LA and CP by electrical stimulation of MGm/PIN and TE3. The size, proximity, and similarity of projection fields of the MGm and PIN prevent the verification of exclusive stimulation of either structure: the tip of the concentric stimulating electrode was positioned in PIN, just ventral to the MGm.Figure 6CS Processing in the CaudoputamenShow full captionThe same measurements and analysis performed in LA (see Figure 5 legend) were performed in CP.

The dimorphic human pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is the etiological agent of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) 1The abbreviations used are: PCM, paracoccidioidomycosis; contig, group of overlapping clones; EST, expressed sequence tag; PbAEST, P. brasiliensis assembled EST sequence; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: PCM, paracoccidioidomycosis; contig, group of overlapping clones; EST, expressed sequence tag; PbAEST, P. brasiliensis assembled EST sequence; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. (1Franco M. J. Med. Vet. Mycol. 1987; 25: 5-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), a major health problem in Latin America. High positive skin tests (75%) in the adult population reinforce the importance of the mycosis in endemic rural areas, where it has been estimated to affect around 10 million individuals, 2% of whom will develop the fatal acute or chronic disease (2Restrepo A. McEwen J.G. Castaneda E. Med. Mycol. 2001; 39: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The acute form of PCM chiefly compromises the reticuloendothelial system; the chronic form mainly affects adult males with a high frequency of pulmonary and/or mucocutaneous involvement (1Franco M. J. Med. Vet. Mycol. 1987; 25: 5-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Chronic severe multifocal PCM may also cause granulomatous lesions in the central nervous system (3de Almeida S.M. Queiroz-Telles F. Teive H.A. Ribeiro C.E. Werneck L.C. J. Infect. 2004; 48: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Regardless of the affected organ, PCM usually evolves to the formation of fibrotic sequelae, permanently hindering the patient's health. P. brasiliensis Undergoes a Dimorphic Process in Vivo—It is assumed that the fungus exists as a soil saprophyte, producing propagules that can infect humans and produce disease after transition to the pathogenic yeast form (4San-Blas G. Nino-Vega G. Iturriaga T. Med. Mycol. 2002; 40: 225-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Pathogenicity has been intimately associated with this process, since P. brasiliensis strains unable to differentiate into the yeast form are avirulent (5San-Blas G. Nino-Vega G. Fungal Pathogenesis: Principles and Clinical Applications. Marcel Dekker, New York2001: 205-226Google Scholar). Mammalian estrogens inhibit dimorphism, explaining the lower incidence of disease in females (6Salazar M.E. Restrepo A. Stevens D.A. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 711-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mycelium-to-yeast transition in P. brasiliensis is governed by the rise in temperature that occurs upon contact of mycelia or conidia with the human host. In vitro, it can be reversibly reproduced by shifting the growth temperature between 22 and 36 °C. Molecular events related to genes that control signal transduction, cell wall synthesis, and integrity are likely to be involved in this dimorphic transition. P. brasiliensis genome size was estimated to be ∼30 Mb (7Cano M.I. Cisalpino P.S. Galindo I. Ramirez J.L. Mortara R.A. da Silveira J.F. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1998; 36: 742-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A study of P. brasiliensis gene density suggests that this fungus contains between 7,500 and 9,000 genes, 2C. Reinoso, G. Niño-Vega, G. San-Blas, and A. Dominguez (2003) IV Congreso Virtual de Micologia, personal communication. 2C. Reinoso, G. Niño-Vega, G. San-Blas, and A. Dominguez (2003) IV Congreso Virtual de Micologia, personal communication. which is in agreement with the estimated gene number for ascomycete fungi genomes. Here are presented the results of an effort to achieve a comprehensive metabolic view of the P. brasiliensis dimorphic life cycle based on analysis of 6,022 groups generated from both mycelium and yeast phases. This view arises from both a general metabolism perspective and the identification of the precise metabolic points that distinguish both morphological phases. Overexpressed genes and those that are up- or down-regulated in both stages were identified. Expression levels were assessed by cDNA microarrays and some were confirmed by Northern blot. Drug targets and genes related to virulence were also detected in several metabolic pathways. Finally, the majority of genes involved in signal transduction pathways (cAMP/protein kinase A, Ca2+/calmodulin, and MAPKs) possibly participating in cell differentiation and infection were annotated, and now we are able to describe the corresponding signaling systems in P. brasiliensis. Fungus—P. brasiliensis isolate Pb01 (ATCC MYA-826) was grown at either 22 °C in the mycelium form (14 days) or 36 °C as yeast (7 days) in semisolid Fava Neto's medium. Following incubation, cells were collected for immediate RNA extraction with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Construction of cDNA Libraries and Sequencing—Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from total mycelium and yeast RNA through oligo(dT)-cellulose columns (Stratagene). Unidirectional cDNA libraries were constructed in λZAPII following supplier's instructions (Stratagene). Phagemids containing fungal cDNA were then mass-excised and replicated in XL-1 Blue MRF′ cells. In order to generate ESTs, single pass 5′-end sequencing of cDNAs was performed by standard fluorescence labeling dye terminator protocols with T7 flanking vector primer. Samples were loaded onto a MegaBACE 1000 DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences) for automated sequence analysis. EST Processing Pipeline and Annotation—PHRED quality assessment and computational analysis were carried out as previously described (8Felipe M.S. Andrade R.V. Petrofeza S.S. Maranhão A.Q. Torres F.A. Albuquerque P. Arraes F.B. Arruda M. Azevedo M.O. Baptista A.J. Bataus L.A. Borges C.L. Campos E.G. Cruz M.R. Daher B.S. Dantas A. Ferreira M.A. Ghil G.V. Jesuino R.S. Kyaw C.M. Leitao L.

Yeast. 2003; 20: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). EST assembly was performed using the software package CAP3 (9Huang X. Madan A. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 868-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (4026) Google Scholar) plus a homemade scaffolding program. Sequences of at least 100 nucleotides, with PHRED ≥20, were considered for clustering. A total of 20,271 ESTs were selected by these exclusion criteria. Contaminant and rRNA sequences were then removed to generate a set of 19,718 ESTs, which was submitted to CAP3 clustering, generating 2,655 contigs and leaving 3,367 ESTs as singlets. Contigs plus singlets comprise the base set of 6,022 P. brasiliensis assembled EST sequences (PbAESTs) that underwent further analysis. Annotation was carried out using a system that essentially compared these assemblies with sequences available in public databases. The BLASTX program (10Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar) was used for annotation along with GenBank™ nonredundant (nr), cluster of orthologous groups (COG), and gene ontology (GO) data bases. The GO data base was also used to assign EC numbers to assemblies. Additionally, we used the FASTA program (11Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9328) Google Scholar) to compare assemblies with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe predicted polypeptides. The INTERPROSCAN program (12Apweiler R. Biswas M. Fleischmann W. Kanapin A. Karavidopoulou Y. Kersey P. Kriventseva E.V. Mittard V. Mulder N. Phan I. Zdobnov E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was used to obtain domain and family classification of the assemblies. Metabolic pathways were analyzed using maps obtained in the KEGG Web site (13Kanehisa M. Goto S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (16238) Google Scholar) with annotated EC numbers, and this information was used to help in assigning function to PbAESTs. Differential Expression Analysis in Silico by Electronic Subtraction—To assign a differential expression character, the contigs formed with mycelium and yeast ESTs were statistically evaluated using a test previously described (14Audic S. Claverie J.M. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar) with a confidence of 95%. cDNA Microarrays and Data Analysis—A set of two microarrays containing a total of 1,152 clones in the form of PCR products was spotted in duplicate on 2.5 × 7.5-cm Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Arrays were prepared using a Generation III Array Spotter (Amersham Biosciences). Complementary DNA inserts of both P. brasiliensis libraries were amplified in 96-well plates using vector-PCR amplification with T3 forward and T7 reverse universal primers. Membranes were first hybridized against the T3 [α-33P]dCTP-labeled oligonucleotide. The amount of DNA deposited in each spot was estimated by the quantification of the obtained signals. After stripping, membranes were used for hybridization against α-33P-labeled cDNA complex probes. The latter were prepared by reverse transcription of 10 μg of filamentous or yeast P. brasiliensis total RNA using oligo(dT)12–18 primer. One hundred microliters of [α-33P]cDNA complex probe (30–50 million cpm) was hybridized against nylon microarrays. Imaging plates were scanned by a phosphor imager (Cyclone; Packard Instruments) to capture the hybridization signals. BZScan software was employed to quantify the signals with background subtraction. Spots were matched with a template grid. The ratio between vector and cDNA complex probe hybridization values for each spot was used as the reference normalization value. Total intensity normalization using the median expression value was adopted as previously described (15Quackenbush J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). Gene expression data analyzed here were obtained from three independent determinations for each phase (filamentous or yeast). We used the significance analysis of microarrays method (16Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9648) Google Scholar) to assess the significant variations in gene expression between both mycelium and yeast. Briefly, this method is based on t test statistics, specially modified to high through-put analysis. A global error chance, the false discovery rate, and a gene error chance (q value) are calculated by the software. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (15 μg) was separated in a 1.5% denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (GE Healthcare). Probes were radiolabeled with the random primers DNA labeling system (Invitrogen) using [α-32P]dATP. Membranes were incubated with the probes in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 4× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0,1% SDS, 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA) at 42 °C overnight and then washed twice (2× SSC, 1% SDS) at 65 °C for 1 h. Signal bands were visualized using a Typhoon 9210 phosphor imager (GE Healthcare).

Transcriptome Features—In sequencing the P. brasiliensis transcriptome, EST data were generated from nonnormalized cDNA libraries of mycelium and yeast cells. The size range of the cDNA inserts ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 kb. Single pass 5′ sequencing was performed on 25,598 cDNA clones, randomly selected from both libraries. Upon removal of bacterial and rRNA contaminant sequences, a total of 19,718 high quality ESTs underwent CAP3 assembly, yielding 2,655 contigs and 3,367 singlets, which constitute the so-called 6,022 P. brasiliensis Assembled EST (PbAEST) data base. Contigs presented an average size of 901 bp, and the number of ESTs assembled into contigs varied from 2 to 657 in the largest one (PbAEST 1068), which corresponds to M51, a previously reported P. brasiliensis mycelium-specific transcript (17Venancio E.J. Kyaw C.M. Mello C.V. Silva S.P. Soares C.M. Felipe M.S. Silva-Pereira I. Med. Mycol. 2002; 40: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Of the 6,022 PbAESTs, 4,198 (69.4%) showed a probable homologue in GenBank™, and 4,130 (68.3%) showed a fungus homologue (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table I). We had used MIPS functional categories to classify 2,931 PbAESTs into 12 major groups. P. brasiliensis showed a slightly higher percentage of PbAESTs (4%) related to cellular communication and signal transduction (Fig. 1B) compared with S. cerevisiae functional categorization (3.4%). Highly and Differentially Expressed Genes—The 27 highly transcribed genes found in the P. brasiliensis transcriptome, using a cut-off of 50 reads, are shown in supplemental Table II. Some of them were previously reported (8Felipe M.S. Andrade R.V. Petrofeza S.S. Maranhão A.Q. Torres F.A. Albuquerque P. Arraes F.B. Arruda M. Azevedo M.O. Baptista A.J. Bataus L.A. Borges C.L.

Also, up- and down-regulated genes in mycelium and yeast cells were detected by statistical comparison of the number of sequences in corresponding PbAESTs (Table I). In order to support the electronic subtraction data, cDNAs from each phase were used to probe cDNA microarrays membranes containing 1,152 clones, which were selected based on the following criteria: (i) ESTs exclusive for a particular morphotype; (ii) ESTs corresponding to genes more expressed in mycelium or yeast cells; and (iii) some ESTs equally expressed in both cell types. From the 1,152 clones, 328 genes were up-regulated during the dimorphic transition: 58 in mycelium and 270 in yeast (data not shown).Table IDifferentially expressed genes in mycelium and yeast cells detected by electronic subtraction and cDNA microarray analysis The PbAESTs were analyzed as to their differential expression by two methods: a statistical analysis of the number of mycelium and yeast ESTs clustered in each PbAEST (14Audic S.

Among them, a subclass of about 40 up-regulated genes in mycelium and yeast are described in Table I, which includes M51, M32, hydrophobin 1/2, the highly expressed yeast PbY20 protein, and some other genes that have previously been described as differentially expressed in P. brasiliensis by different approaches (17Venancio E.J.

Other key up-regulated genes related to the metabolism of P. brasiliensis (Table I) are described and discussed elsewhere in this work. Interestingly, we have found a yeast phase preferentially expressed gene that possibly encodes a previously characterized P. brasiliensis estradiol-binding protein (21Loose D.S. Stover E.P. Restrepo A. Stevens D.A. Feldman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7659-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), also described in C. albicans and in other fungi (22Madani N.D.

It is speculated that the interaction of the 17-β-estradiol hormone with a cytoplasmic protein inhibits the mycelium-to-yeast transition, explaining the lower incidence of PCM in females. Metabolic Overview—P. brasiliensis seems to be capable of producing ATP from the classical pathways of glycolysis, alcohol fermentation, and oxidative phosphorylation, since alcohol dehydrogenase, cytochrome genes, ATP synthase subunits, and pyrophosphatase genes were annotated. All genes encoding glycolytic enzymes were identified in both mycelium and yeast. Genes corresponding to the citrate cycle enzymes and to the components of complexes I, II, III, and IV were found, reflecting the ability of the fungus to perform complete aerobic pyruvate degradation and oxidative phosphorylation. Its putative capacity to also grow in anaerobiosis was evidenced by the alternative conversion of pyruvate to ethanol. Last, it may be able to utilize two-carbon sources in the form of acetate and ethanol through the glyoxylate cycle and obtain sulfite and nitrite from the environment. In order to validate the carbon source utilization profile predicted by the transcriptome data, two P. brasiliensis isolates (Pb01 and Pb18) were grown in McVeigh-Morton minimum medium supplemented with different carbon sources and growth patterns were qualitatively evaluated (supplemental Table III). We observed that, in accordance to the transcriptome analysis prediction, several mono- and disaccharides, such as d-glucose, d-fructose, d-galactose, d-mannose, d-sorbitol, α-trehalose, maltose, and sucrose were indeed utilized. On the other hand, the predicted assimilation of d-inositol was not confirmed. Transcripts relate"

(2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 20589-20596; Cremesti, A., Paris, F., Grassme, H., Holler, N., Tschopp, J., Fuks, Z., Gulbins, E., and Kolesnick, R. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 23954-23961). Translocation of the secretory form of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) into microscopic rafts generates therein the ceramide that drives raft coalescence. This process serves to feed forward Fas activation, with ∼2% of full caspase 8 activation sufficient for maximal ASMase translocation, leading to death-inducing signaling complex formation within ceramide-rich platforms, and apoptosis. Here we report that treatment of Jurkat T cells with UV-C also induces ASMase translocation into rafts within 1 min, catalyzing sphingomyelin hydrolysis to ceramide and raft clustering. In contrast to Fas, UV-induced ASMase translocation and activation were caspase-independent. Nonetheless, ceramide-rich platforms promoted UV-C-induced death signaling, because ASMase inhibition or raft disruption inhibited apoptosis, improving clonogenic cell survival. These studies thus define two distinct mechanisms for biologically relevant ASMase activation within rafts; a Fas-mediated mechanism dependent upon caspase 8 and FADD, and a UV-induced mechanism independent of caspase activation. Consistent with this notion, genetic depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of caspase 8 or FADD, which render Jurkat cells incapable of sphingolipid signaling and apoptosis upon Fas ligation, did not impair these events upon UV-C stimulation.

Hence, ceramide-mediated raft clustering into macrodomains appears to represent a generic mechanism for transmembrane signaling, rather than a specific mechanism for apoptosis induction. The present studies address the mechanism of ASMase translocation into rafts. Jurkat cells display two distinct mechanisms, the caspase-dependent mechanism used by Fas and a previously unrecognized caspase-independent mechanism utilized by UV-C. In both instances, the outcome of translocation is ceramide generation in rafts, raft coalescence into platforms, and apoptosis. However, in the case of UV-C, although apoptosis is dependent on ceramide generation, it is independent of Fas activation or death-inducing signaling complex-mediated initiator caspase activation. These data indicate that generation of ceramide, rather than the mechanism of ASMase activation, regulates platform formation and stress-induced apoptosis. Cell Culture and Stimulation—Wild-type (clone E6-1), caspase 8-/- (clone I9.2) and FADD-/- (clone I2.1) Jurkat T lymphocytes were obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD). Cells were grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μm nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Prior to stimulation with UV-C or α-Fas, cells were resuspended in fresh medium and allowed to acclimate for 4 h. Cells were then treated with 50 ng/ml α-Fas CH-11 activating antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or 50 J/m2 UV-C using an FB-UVXL-1000 cross-linker (Fisher Biotech, Pittsburgh, PA), unless otherwise indicated. For platform studies, cells were incubated with CH-11 at 4 °C for 20 min to ensure uniform receptor engagement and warmed to 37 °C to initiate stimulation. Where indicated, cells were preincubated with 10 μm z-VAD-fmk (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), 30 μg/ml nystatin (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 μm imipramine (Sigma-Aldrich), or 1 μg/ml mouse monoclonal α-ceramide antibody MID15B4 (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA). Nystatin, imipramine, and α-ceramide studies were performed in RPMI containing 0.5% lipid-free fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan UT). In each study, an aliquot of cells were stained with trypan blue to assess viability. Apoptosis Quantitation—Apoptosis was assessed by two different techniques. Staining for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling was performed on cells permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate at 4 °C for 5 min, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Alternately, stimulated cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stained with 100 μl of 24 μg/ml bisbenzimide trihydrochloride solution (Hoechst #33258, Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min. Morphologic changes of nuclear apoptosis, including chromatin condensation, segmentation, and compaction along the periphery of the nucleus or the appearance of apoptotic bodies were quantified using an Axiovert S-100 Zeiss fluorescence microscope as previously described (16Cremesti A. Paris F. Grassme H. Holler N. Tschopp J. Fuks Z. Gulbins E. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23954-23961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). A minimum of 200 cells was examined per point. Clonogenic Assay—Colony formation following UV-C or α-Fas CH-11 treatment was evaluated using a soft agar cloning assay as described previously (45Dai Y.C. Lu X.Q. Fang Z. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1992; 28A: 685-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were preincubated with nystatin and α-ceramide monoclonal antibody, or vehicle and control IgM in RPMI plus 0.5% lipid-free fetal bovine serum, and stimulated with increasing doses of UV-C or α-Fas. After 4 h, cells were suspended in RPMI medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm l-glutamine, and 40% methylcellulose medium, and plated in triplicate. After 14-16 days of incubation, colonies were scored and colony formation for each condition was calculated in relation to values obtained for untreated control cells. Colony survival curves were calculated by least square regression analysis, using a modification of the program FIT (46Albright N. Radiat. Res. 1987; 112: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The program fits the curves by iteratively weighted least squares to each set of dose-survival data, estimates the covariates of the survival curve parameters and the corresponding confidence regions, and plots the survival curve. It also derives curve parameters, such as the Do (the reciprocal of the slope on the exponential portion of the curve, representing the level of radiosensitivity) and the N number (measuring the size of the shoulder). Platform Detection—Platforms were detected as previously described. Briefly, 1 × 106 Jurkat cells were stimulated with UV-C or α-Fas, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde at the indicated times, blocked in PBS containing 1% fetal bovine serum, and then washed with PBS. Cells were stained for the raft-localized lipid GM1 with FITC-conjugated cholera toxin β-subunit (2 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min at 4 °C, washed twice in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (Dako, Carpenteria, CA). Fluorescence was detected using an Axiovert S-100 Zeiss fluorescence microscope equipped with a SPOT digital camera. The percentage of cells containing platforms, i.e. those in which the fluorescence condenses onto <15% of the cell surface, was determined by counting 150-250 cells per point. Alternately, platforms were identified using a mouse monoclonal α-ceramide antibody MID 15B4 IgM (1:50 dilution, Alexis Biochemicals), mouse monoclonal α-Fas CH-11 IgM (1:500 dilution, Upstate Biotechnology) or polyclonal rabbit α-ASMase antibody 1598 (1:100 dilution) and detected using Cy3-conjugated α-mouse or α-rabbit IgM (1:500 dilution, Roche Applied Science), respectively. Rabbit polyclonal α-CD46 (1:1000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used as a negative control. In some studies, confocal images were obtained using a Leica TCS SPZ upright confocal microscope. The rabbit polyclonal anti-ASMase antibody #1598 was generated against full-length FLAG-tagged human ASMase protein. Anti-sera was purified over a Bio-Rad T-Gel column to obtain an IgG fraction that displays specific immunoreactivity by immunoblot assay at a concentration of 100 ng/μl toward 100 ng of purified recombinant human ASMase or ASMase from 25 μg of Jurkat cell lysates. At a concentration of 200 μg/μl, #1598 quantitatively immunoprecipitates ASMase activity from 100 ng of purified ASMase and at a concentration of 200 ng/μl detects cell surface expression of ASMase by flow cytometry or confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Diacylglycerol Kinase Assay—Jurkat cells, stimulated with UV-C or CH-11, were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C. Stimulation was terminated by the addition of 2 ml of chloroform:methanol:HCl (100:100:1, v/v), and ceramide was quantified by the diacyglycerol kinase assay, as described (47Gulbins E.

Nature. 1991; 351: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). MHC-I can ligate a diverse array of antigenic peptides because of the high degree of polymorphism within the six pockets of the antigen-binding cleft (6Margulies D. McCluskey J. Paul W. Fundamental Immunology. 5th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2003Google Scholar). Selection of peptides that bind the MHC-I cleft is usually determined by only two pockets that specify primary anchor sites (7Guo H.C. Madden D.R. Silver M.L. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For example, the common MHC-I molecule HLA-B35 preferentially binds peptide ligands with proline as a dominant anchor residue at position 2 (P2) and generally a tyrosine at the C terminus (PΩ) (9Falk K.

An extreme example of accommodating a lengthy class I-restricted peptide was observed in rat MHC-I RT1-Aa complexed to a 13-mer epitope, MTF-E (25Speir J.A. Stevens J. Joly E. Butcher G.W. Wilson I.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of this binary complex reveals a highly solvent-exposed, centrally bulged peptide that displays sufficient mobility to adopt two different conformations within the antigen-binding cleft. Solvent-exposed saccharide residues in glycopeptides presented by MHC molecules have also been observed to protrude substantially from the peptide-binding groove (32Glithero A. Tormo J. Haurum J.S. Arsequell G. Valencia G. Edwards J. Springer S. Townsend A. Pao Y-L. Wormald M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 63-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recently, unusually long MHC-II-restricted epitopes have been shown to adopt a β-hairpin structure at the C-terminal end of the peptide-binding groove (33Zavala-Ruiz Z. Strug I. Walker B.D. Norris P.J. Stern L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13279-13284Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); however, this has not been observed for longer class I peptides. Despite the description of unusually long self-peptides being naturally presented, the role of longer epitopes in antiviral immunity is poorly understood. The prevalence of such epitopes in immunity and the factors governing the processing and presentation of these epitopes are largely unknown. Moreover, how a T-cell receptor (TcR) engages such a pMHC complex and the nature of the T-cell repertoire elicited from such a unique pMHC complex are unknown. However, it has been suggested that prominently bulged peptides may prevent many TcRs from approaching the surface of the MHC molecule, thereby limiting the potential immunogenicity of unusually long class I-binding antigenic peptides (28Guo H.C. Jardetzky T.S. Garrett T.P. Lane W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, immunodominant viral epitopes >11 amino acids in length have not been well described in antiviral CD8+ T-cell responses. To begin to address such issues, we have investigated the immune response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a ubiquitous human pathogen. The CTL response to the very immunogenic lytic antigen BZLF1 includes a cluster of three overlapping sequences of different lengths, a 9-mer (56LPQGQLTAY64), an 11-mer (54EPLPQGQLTAY64), and a 13-mer (52LPEPLPQGQLTAY64), that may form HLA-B*3501-restricted epitopes (27Green K.J. Miles J.J. Tellam J. van Zuylen W.J. Connolly G. Burrows S.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2510-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All peptides bind well to HLA-B*3501; however, the CTL response in individuals expressing this allotype is directed exclusively toward the 11-mer (27Green K.J. Miles J.J. Tellam J. van Zuylen W.J. Connolly G. Burrows S.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2510-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the 13-mer epitope (LPEPLPQGQLTAY) is the exclusive target for the CTL response in individuals expressing the HLA-B*3508 allele, which differs from HLA-B*3501 by a single Leu156 → Arg substitution (27Green K.J. Miles J.J. Tellam J. van Zuylen W.J. Connolly G. Burrows S.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2510-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The above observations are examples of peptide immunodominance (27Green K.J. Miles J.J. Tellam J. van Zuylen W.J. Connolly G. Burrows S.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2510-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide a structural basis for the presentation of long HLA-B35-restricted epitopes and show the restricted nature of the T-cell response (T-cell immunodominance) to these unusual ligands. Lymphoblastoid cell lines were established by exogenous transformation of peripheral B-cells with EBV derived from the supernatant of the B95.8 cell line and were maintained in growth medium (10% fetal calf serum and RPMI 1640 medium). The mutant lymphoblastoid cell line × T lymphoblastoid hybrid cell line 174xCEM.T2 (referred to as T2 cells) (34Salter R.D. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), expressing HLA-B*3508 (T2.B*3508) (27Green K.J. Miles J.J. Tellam J. van Zuylen W.J. Connolly G. Burrows S.R. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1999; 29: 1587-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was also used in this study. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) blasts were generated by stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with PHA (Sigma), and after 3 days, growth medium containing supernatant from the interleukin-2-producing cell line MLA-144 (European Collection of Cell Cultures) and recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) were added. PHA blasts were propagated with biweekly replacement of rIL-2 and MLA-144 supernatant (PHA-free) for up to 8 weeks. The blood donors used in this study were healthy laboratory staff selected for particular HLA alleles, and prior exposure to EBV was assessed by standard virus-specific antibody tests. All cell lines were regularly screened for mycoplasma contamination. CTL clones were generated by agar cloning as follows. PBMCs (2 × 106) were stimulated in 2 ml of growth medium with autologous PBMCs that had been precoated with the LPEPLPQGQLTAY peptide at 1 μm for 1 h (responder/stimulator ratio of 2:1). After 3 days, cells were dispersed and seeded on 0.35% (w/v) agarose (Seaplaque, BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Rockland, ME) containing RPMI 1640 medium, 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and 25% (v/v) supernatant from MLA-144 cultures and rIL-2 (50 units/ml). Colonies were harvested after an additional 3-5 days and amplified in culture with biweekly restimulation with rIL-2, MLA-144 supernatant, and γ-irradiated (8000 rads) autologous lymphoblastoid cell lines that had been prelabeled with the LPEPLPQGQLTAY peptide at 0.1 μm for 1 h and washed three times. Cytotoxicity Assay/Fine Specificity Analysis—CTL cultures were tested in duplicate or triplicate for cytotoxicity in a standard 5-h chromium release assay. Briefly, CTLs were assayed against 51Cr-labeled PHA blast targets that were pretreated with synthetic peptide or left untreated. Percent specific lysis was calculated, and the peptide concentration required for half-maximum lysis was determined from dose-response curves. To reduce spontaneous lysis of PHA blast target cells, the medium used in the chromium release assays was supplemented with rIL-2. Peptides were synthesized by Mimotopes Ltd. (Clayton, Victoria, Australia). Toxicity testing of all peptides was performed prior to use by adding peptide to 51Cr-labeled PHA blasts in the absence of CTL effectors. A β-scintillation counter (Topcount Microplate, Packard Instrument Co.) was used to measure 51Cr levels in assay supernatant samples. The mean spontaneous lysis for target cells in the culture medium was always <20%, and the variation about the mean specific lysis was <10%. PBMCs or bulk T-cell cultures were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with a phycoerythrin-labeled HLA-B*3508LPEPLPQGQLTAY tetramer (Proimmune Ltd., Oxford, UK). Cells were then washed and labeled for 30 min at 4 °C with TRI-COLOR®-labeled anti-human CD8 antibody (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), allophycocyanin-labeled anti-human CD3 antibody (Pharmingen), and one of the following fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled TcRβ chain-specific antibodies (Serotec, Oxford): Vβ1 (TRBV9), Vβ2 (TRBV20-1), Vβ3 (TRBV28), Vβ5.1 (TRBV5-1), Vβ5.2 (TRBV5-6), Vβ5.3 (TRBV5-5), Vβ6.7 (TRBV7-1), Vβ7 (TRBV4), Vβ8 (TRBV12), Vβ11 (TRBV25-1), Vβ12 (TRBV10), Vβ13.1 (TRBV6-5), Vβ13.6 (TRBV6-6), Vβ14 (TRBV27), Vβ16 (TRBV14), Vβ17 (TRBV19), Vβ18 (TRBV18), Vβ20 (TRBV30), Vβ21.3 (TRBV11-1), Vβ22 (TRBV2), or Vβ23 (TRBV13). Cells were washed and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Cell sorting was performed on a MoFlo high proficiency cell sorter (Cytomation, Inc., Fort Collins, CO). T-cell clones were verified for purity and peptide specificity by flow cytometry with an HLA-B*3508LPEPLPQGQLTAY tetramer before TcR analysis was performed. Total RNA was extracted from T-cell clones and tetramer sorted bulk CTL cultures using TRIzol reagent. Reverse transcription was performed with Superscript III (Invitrogen) and antisense TcRα and TcRβ chain primers. PCR was performed in a 25-μl volume consisting of 200 μm dNTPs, 20 mm MgCl2, and 1.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using a TcRβ constant primer and 1 of 24 TcRβ V family-specific primers or a TcRα C constant primer and 1 of 34 TcRα V family-specific primers (36Panzara M.A. Gussoni E. Steinman L. Oksenberg J.R. Bio-Techniques. 1992; 12: 728-735Google Scholar). PCR products were purified and ligated into the pGEM-T vector system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and sequenced using the ABI PRISM BigDye terminator reaction kit (Applied Biosystems). Nomenclature for TcR usage is based on the International ImMunoGeneTics Information System (37Lefranc M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Soluble HLA-B*3501 and HLA-B*3508 molecules (residues 1-276) and full-length β2-microglobulin (residues 1-99) were expressed, refolded with the LPEPLPQGQLTAY peptide, purified, and concentrated to 10 mg/ml as described previously (38Macdonald W. Williams D.S. Clements C.S. Gorman J.J. Kjer-Nielsen L. Brooks A.G. McCluskey J. Rossjohn J. Purcell A.W. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The HLA-B35 crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. Large (0.7 × 0.5 × 0.3 mm) block-shaped crystals grew within 5 days in 0.2 m ammonium acetate and 17% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 (100 mm cacodylate (pH 7.6)) at 4 °C. Crystals were directly transferred to cryoprotectant-containing 20% glycerol and flash-frozen prior to data collection. Data were collected on an in-house radiation source and at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). Data were processed and scaled using the HKL suite (see Table I) (39Rossmann M.G. van Beek C.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and improved through multiple rounds of refinement using the CNS suite (41Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). The progress of refinement was monitored by Rfac and Rfree values. Rigid body refinement and simulated annealing were used in the first instance, but in later rounds, energy minimization and B-individual refinement were used to improve the quality of the model. See Table I for the final refinement and model statistics. The genes encoding TRAV19 and TRBV6-1 were cloned from the HLA-B*3508-restricted, 13-mer-specific T-cell clone SB27. DNA encoding the extracellular domains of TRAV19 and TRBV6-1 and terminating immediately before the interchain extracellular cysteines was cloned into the pET30 expression vector (Novagen). DNA encoding the unpaired cysteine at position 77 of TRBV6-1 was mutated to encode an alanine. Additionally, DNA was mutated to encode a cysteine in the constant domain of both TRAV19 (Thr48 → Cys) and TRBV6-1 (Ser57 → Cys) (75Boulter J.M. Glick M. Todorov P.T. Baston E. Sami M. Rizkallah P. Jakobsen B.K. Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). TRAV19 and TRBV6-1 were expressed, refolded, and purified as described previously (76Garboczi D.N. Utz U. Ghosh P. Seth A. Kim J. VanTienhoven E.A. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5403-5410PubMed Google Scholar), except that the protein was refolded in the presence of 5 m urea. All surface plasmon resonance experiments were carried out at 25 °C on a Biacore 3000 instrument using 10 mm HEPES-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20 (supplied by the manufacturer) supplemented with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin to inhibit nonspecific binding.

For each experiment, 400-600 response units of SB27 was captured on the antibody. MHC (1-56.2 μm) was injected over all flow cells at 20 μl/min. The final response was calculated by subtraction of the response to the antibody alone from the response to the antibody·TcR complex. The antibody surface was regenerated between each analyte injection using ActiSep (Sterogene Bioseparations Inc.). BIAevaluation Version 3.1 (Biacore) was used for data analysis; the 1:1 Langmuir binding model was used to calculate the kinetic constants. To allow for the capture system, the model was modified to include an additional parameter for the drifting base line and local fitting of the binding maxima. The calculated Kd (Kd(calc); koff/kon) concurred with the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd(eq)) for all reported values. This experiment was performed twice. To further support this result, the reverse experiment was performed, in which HLA-B*3501LPEPLPQGQLTAY and HLA-B*3508LPEPLPQGQLTAY were coupled to different flow cells on research-grade CM5 chips using the MHC-specific antibody W6/32 (43Parham P. Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.F. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 342-349PubMed Google Scholar), and the SB27 TcR (1-56.2 μm) was injected at 20 μl/min over all flow cells. Blanks were subtracted, and data were examined as described above. Similar results for all experiments (n = 3) were obtained. The means ± S.E. were determined. To address the structural basis of binding of long epitopes to HLA-B35, we determined the crystal structure of the immunogenic HLA-B*3508LPEPLPQGQLTAY complex to 1.5-Å resolution (Rfac = 20.3%, Rfree = 22.7%) and the non-immunogenic HLA-B*3501LPEPLPQGQLTAY complex to 1.6-Å resolution (Rfac = 21.9%, Rfree = 23.1%) (Table I). The two complexes crystallize in the same space group under identical conditions with isomorphous unit cells; and notably, the bound epitopes do not participate in crystal contacts. Accordingly, conformational differences that are observed between the two crystal structures can be attributed to the polymorphic amino acid at position 156. The electron density for the bound peptides was very clear in the HLA-B*3501LPEPLPQGQLTAY and HLA-B*3508LPEPLPQGQLTAY structures (Fig. 1, A and B). The features of the HLA-B*3508LPEPLPQGQLTAY complex are discussed first, followed by the salient aspects of the other binary complex. The LPEPLPQGQLTAY epitope is bound in the bulged mode, with the N and C termini anchored in the A- and F-pockets, respectively; 11 of the 12 direct hydrogen bonds between the peptide and HLA-B*3508 are located within these pockets (Table II). The P1-C-α/PΩ-C-α distance is 21.9 Å in the HLA-B*3508LPEPLPQGQLTAY complex (Fig. 1C), which compares closely with the P1-C-α/PΩ-C-α distance observed in the previously determined octameric and nonameric HLA-B*3501 complexes (44Menssen R. Orth P. Ziegler A. Saenger W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 45Smith K.J. Reid S.W. Stuart D.I. McMichael A.J. Jones E.Y. Bell J.I. Immunity. 1996; 4: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The P1-Leu binds in a standard class I binding mode within the A-pocket, differing from that previously observed in the octameric HLA-B*3501 complex. The nonstandard positioning of the PΩ residue, initially observed in the octameric HLA-B*3501 complex (45Smith K.J. Reid S.W. Stuart D.I. McMichael A.J. Jones E.Y. Bell J.I. Immunity. 1996; 4: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), is also present in the HLA-B*3508LPEPLPQGQLTAY complex; this indicates that the mode of binding within the PΩ pocket is a characteristic of HLA-B35 and is independent of peptide length. The P2-Pro binding pocket, an anchor motif for HLA-B35, is conserved between this structure and that described previously (45Smith K.J. Reid S.W. Stuart D.I. McMichael A.J. Jones E.Y. Bell J.I. Immunity. 1996; 4: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Notably, there is a large network of water-mediated hydrogen bonds between HLA-B*3508 and the LPEPLPQGQLTAY epitope, which may partly assist in stabilizing this epitope within the binding groove (Table II); many of these water molecules reside in the space normally occupied by the central region of the 8/9-mer peptides bound to HLA-B35.Table IIHLA-B*3508 contacts with the LPEPLPQGQLTAY epitopePeptide residueMHCType of bond08/01 differencesLeu1 OTyr159 OHH-bondLeu1 NTyr171 OH, Tyr7 OHH-bondLeu1Arg62, Asn63, Trp167VDWaVDW, van der Waals.Pro2Tyr7, Asn63, Ile66, Tyr99, Tyr159VDWGlu3 NTyr99 OHH-bondGlu3 NTyr9 OHWater-mediatedGlu3 OTyr9 OH, Asn70 N-δ2Water-mediatedGlu3 O-ε1Arg97 NH1, NH2Salt bridgeGlu3 O-ε1Arg156 N-εSalt bridge, water-mediated08Glu3 O-ε1Asp114 O-δ2Water-mediated01Glu3 O-ε2Gln155 O-ε1Water-mediated08Glu3 O-ε2Ala152 OWater-mediated01Glu3Tyr15"

Exposure to fluoride can inhibit protein synthesis, and this may also occur by agents that cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. When translated proteins fail to fold properly or become misfolded, ER stress response genes are induced that together comprise the unfolded protein response. Because ameloblasts are responsible for dental enamel formation, we used an ameloblast-derived cell line (LS8) to characterize specific responses to fluoride treatment. LS8 cells were growth-inhibited by as little as 1.9–3.8 ppm fluoride, whereas higher doses induced ER stress and caspase-mediated DNA fragmentation. Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible proteins (GADD153/CHOP, GADD45α), binding protein (BiP/glucose-responsive protein 78 (GRP78), the non-secreted form of carbonic anhydrase VI (CA-VI), and active X-box-binding protein-1 (Xbp-1) were all induced significantly after exposure to 38 ppm fluoride. Unexpectedly, DNA fragmentation increased when GADD153 expression was inhibited by short interfering RNA treatment but remained unaffected by transient GADD153 overexpression. Analysis of control and GADD153-/- embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that caspase-3 mediated the increased DNA fragmentation observed in the GADD153 null cells. We also demonstrate that mouse incisor ameloblasts are sensitive to the toxic effects of high dose fluoride in drinking water. Activated Ire1 initiates an ER stress response pathway, and mouse ameloblasts were shown to express activated Ire1. Ire1 levels appeared induced by fluoride treatment, indicating that ER stress may play a role in dental fluorosis. Low dose fluoride, such as that present in fluoridated drinking water, did not induce ER stress. The mechanism of how fluoride causes fluorosis remains unknown.

However, acute or chronic exposure to fluoride can result in enamel (1DenBesten P.K. Community Dent. Oral Epid. 1999; 27: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and skeletal fluorosis (2Boivin G. Chavassieux P. Chapuy M.C. Baud C.A. Meunier P.J.

Fluoride is present in fresh water at concentrations of less than 0.1 ppm to >100 ppm, and concentrations of ∼1.6–1.8 ppm in drinking water are the threshold for fluorosis risk among the population (5Whitford G.M. Myers H.M. The Metabolism and Toxicity of Fluoride. 2nd Ed. Karger, New York1996: 1-156Google Scholar). Fluoride ingestion between the ages of 15 and 30 months may be the most critical for fluorosis of the esthetically important human maxillary central incisors (6Evans R.W. Stamm J.W. J. Public Health Dent. 1991; 51: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 7Evans R.W. Darvell B.W. J. Public Health Dent. 1995; 55: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is during this time that dental enamel forms on the unerupted permanent teeth. Rodents, including mice and rats, have continuously erupting incisors that manifest each developmental stage of enamel formation (amelogenesis). Moving from the distal tip of the incisor back to where the incisor grows beneath the molars, the developmental stages become progressively less mature. The initial stage of enamel development is the secretory stage. The columnar ameloblast cells of the enamel organ are responsible for dental enamel development. During the secretory stage the ameloblasts are tall, contain an extensive endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BiP, binding protein; CHOP, C/EBP homologous protein; CA-VI, carbonic anhydrase VI; GADD, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; UPR, unfolded protein response; Xbp-1, X-box-binding protein-1; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; z-, benzyloxycarbonyl; siRNA, short interfering RNA; TUNEL, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling; EO, enamel organ; CMV, cytomegalovirus. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BiP, binding protein; CHOP, C/EBP homologous protein; CA-VI, carbonic anhydrase VI; GADD, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; UPR, unfolded protein response; Xbp-1, X-box-binding protein-1; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; z-, benzyloxycarbonyl; siRNA, short interfering RNA; TUNEL, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling; EO, enamel organ; CMV, cytomegalovirus. and secrete large amounts of protein into the enamel matrix. During the maturation stage the ameloblasts are short, and in contrast to the secretory stage, they absorb proteins from the enamel matrix (8Smith C.E. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1998; 9: 128-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In 1977 Smith and Warshawsky (9Smith C.E. Warshawsky H. Anat. Rec. 1977; 187: 63-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) demonstrated that during the transition between the secretory and maturation stages (transition stage) an approximate 25% loss of rat incisor ameloblasts occurs with another 25% loss before the completion of the maturation stage. Subsequent studies confirmed the presence of apoptotic ameloblasts associated with normal rodent incisor development (10Bronckers A.L. Lyaruu D.M. Goei W. Litz M. Luo G. Karsenty G. Woltgens J.H.

Although enamel fluorosis research has spanned seven decades (14Schour I. Smith M. J. Am. Dent. Assoc. 1935; : 796-813Google Scholar), no consensus exists as to the mechanism of its cause. One school of thought presents compelling evidence that fluorosis is caused primarily by the presence of excessive fluoride within the forming enamel. The fluoride ions are postulated to adversely affect the precipitation of hydroxyapatite that forms the enamel structure (15Aoba T. Fejerskov O. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2002; 13: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Although this postulate has merit, it does not adequately explain why different inbred strains of mice had different susceptibilities/resistance to enamel fluorosis, whereas the overall levels of fluoride present in their erupted incisors did not differ significantly (16Everett E.T. McHenry M.A. Reynolds N. Eggertsson H. Sullivan J. Kantmann C. Martinez-Mier E.A. Warrick J.M. Stookey G.K. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 794-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, fluoride concentrations in enamel from unerupted human molars did not correlate positively with fluorosis severity, and it was concluded that individual genetic variation likely plays a role in fluorosis susceptibility (17Vieira A.P. Hancock R. Limeback H. Maia R. Grynpas M.D. J. Dent. Res. 2004; 83: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We examined the possibility that fluoride can cause an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. ER stress occurs when nascent proteins are not folded properly and/or are misfolded, leading to the initiation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). As the unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, the chaperone-binding protein BiP is released into the lumen and binds to hydrophobic regions on the surface of the unfolded proteins to facilitate proper folding (18Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). The UPR can activate three different primary ER stress response pathways (18Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 19Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The only pathway that is conserved among all eukaryotic cells is that initiated by Ire1 (21Liu C.Y. Kaufman R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1861-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Ire1 is both a kinase and an endoribonuclease. ER stress initiates Ire1 autophosphorylation and subsequent RNase activity specific for spliceosome-independent processing of Xbp1 mRNA. Processing of the Xbp1 mRNA by Ire1 results in a translation frameshift that allows encoding of active Xbp1 (22Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar, 23Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2870) Google Scholar). Active Xbp1 is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that can bind to and initiate transcription from both the ER stress response element (ERSE) and the UPR element (23Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2870) Google Scholar, 24Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The UPR will also adapt to ER stress by translation attenuation, by protein degradation, or finally, by apoptosis. Although GADD45α is not known to be part of the UPR, it is a cell cycle checkpoint protein that arrests cells at G2/M phase (25Jin S. Antinore M.J. Lung F.D. Dong X. Zhao H. Fan F. Colchagie A.B.

GADD153/CHOP is an ER stress response gene that can also be induced by other stressors such as amino acid deprivation and exposure to oxidants (26Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The GADD153/CHOP gene encodes a bZIP C/EBP homologous protein that forms heterodimers with other CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) (28Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). When phosphorylated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, GADD153 becomes a more potent inducer of apoptosis. GADD34 was recently demonstrated to be directly activated by GADD153 (29Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). Even so, the downstream effects of GADD153 expression are not well characterized (20Oyadomari S. Mori M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). In this study we utilize the LS8 ameloblast cell line that was derived from mouse enamel organ (30Chen L.S. Couwenhoven R.I. Hsu D. Luo W. Snead M.L. Arch. Oral Biol. 1992; 37: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) to assess whether fluoride can induce ER stress and initiate the UPR. We present evidence that fluoride induces an ER stress response involving caspases and increased expression levels of Bip, Xbp-1, GADD153, GADD45α, Ire1, and the non-secreted form of carbonic anhydrase VI (CA-VI). Cell Culture—The mouse ameloblast-derived cell line (LS8) and the CHOP-/- and CHOP+/+ (referred to as GADD153-/- or -+/+) mouse embryo fibroblasts were maintained in α minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Sodium Fluoride Treatment and Determination of Cell Growth and Viability—To assess cell viability and growth, survival and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays were performed. For survival assays, LS8 cells were plated at a density of 1000 cells in T-25 cm2 flasks for 18 h and exposed to concentrations of NaF (stock, 100× in water) from between 0 and 2 mm for a period of 24 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to grow in fresh medium for ∼8–9 days. The resulting colonies were stained with 0.5% methylene blue in 50% methanol and counted. Percent cell survival was then calculated (31Bartlett J.D. Luethy J.D. Carlson S.G. Sollott S.J. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20465-20470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bertrand R. Kerrigan D. Sarang M. Pommier Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For MTT assays, cells were plated in 96-well plates, and the experiments were performed after 18 h. The indicated concentrations of NaF were added to the wells. After 24 and 48 h, cell growth was determined by measuring MTT (Sigma) reductase activity. Briefly, MTT (0.5 mg/ml final concentration) was added and incubated for 3.5 h. After removal of the medium, crystals were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (Sigma), and optical density was measured at 550 nm using a microplate reader (HTS 7000 Bio Assay Reader, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Six wells were analyzed, and the mean value was calculated for each NaF concentration. Experiments were performed in triplicate. DNA Fragmentation ELISA Assay—DNA fragmentation was assayed using the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of either 50 μm z-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (Promega) or 2 μm z-DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone (BioVision) for 1 h at 37 °C and then treated with NaF for 24 or 48 h followed by processing for the Cell Death ELISA assay. The procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. All assays were performed in triplicate. Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was extracted from LS8 cells with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was prepared using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). PCR primers were: CA-VI Type A (sense), 5′-AGTGCTGGGCTTAGTTTAGAGCTTTCC-3′, CA-VI Type B (sense), 5′-TCCTGCATTCAGGGCTACAGCATCTG-3′, and CA-VI type A and B (antisense), 5′-AGATCGATCGATACTGTGTGTCCGT-3′. Northern Blot Analysis—The GADD153, BiP, GADD45α, XBP-1, β-actin, and CA-VI type B cDNA fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using Prime-It RmT random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). In brief, 50 ng of PCR product was added to the reagent mix (containing random primers and dNTPs) and boiled for 5 min. Ten μl of [α-32P]dCTP and 3 μl of magenta DNA polymerase were added to the boiled mix and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The labeled cDNA fragment was denatured and added to the hybridization solution. Ten μg of total RNA was run on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was prehybridized in hybridization solution with 0.1 mg/ml heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen) at 65 °C for 1 h. 32P-Labeled cDNA was added, and the membrane was incubated at 65 °C overnight. The membrane was washed (0.1 × SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.5% SDS) at 65 °C 3 times for 30 min each. Membranes were stripped and re-probed for the indicated mRNAs. Extraction and Treatment of Primary Porcine Enamel Organ Epithelial Cells—Third molar tooth buds were removed from the mandible of a 6-month-old pig and placed in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 0.02% EDTA for 30 min. Enamel organs were dissected from mineralizing tooth cusps and pulp organs. The enamel organs were dissociated into a single cell suspension as previously described (33Young C.S. Kim S.W. Qin C. Baba O. Butler W.T. Taylor R.R. Bartlett J.D. Vacanti J.P. Yelick P.C. Arch. Oral Biol. 2005; 50: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with the modification that any undissociated tissue pieces were eliminated by passing the suspension through a 40-μm cell sieve (BD Biosciences). Approximately 3 × 106 cells were obtained per enamel organ. Enamel organ cells were grown in Primaria T-75 flasks in LHC-8 medium (BIOSOURCE) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B, and 0.5 μg/ml epinephrine at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 10–12 days in culture, a fast-growing fibroblast-like cell population grew to confluency and then expired. Slow-growing epithelial cells remained. These cells were polygonal and grew as tightly clustered colonies. The cells were 80–90% confluent after an additional 20 days in culture. Cells were harvested (trypsin) from flasks, counted, and inoculated into 6-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells per well. The next day duplicate wells were treated or not with 2 mm NaF for 48 h followed by collection of total RNA with Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen). This procedure was performed on EO cells from two different 6-month-old pigs. Real-time PCR Analysis of GADD153 and BiP Expression in Primary Porcine Enamel Organ Epithelial Cells—SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen) generated the cDNA for real-time PCR analysis. Primer sequence for expression analyses were: porcine BiP, forward, 5′-AAGACAAAGGTACAGGCAACAAAA-3′, reverse, 5′-CTCAGCAAACTTCTCAGCATCATT-3′; porcine GADD153, forward, 5′-CCTTGGGCTACTGCTGAC-3′, reverse, 5′-CATGAATAGAGGGGGTTGAG-3′. Internal control primers for porcine eEF1α1 were: forward, 5′-GATGGAAAGTCACCCGTAAAGATG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTTGGACGAGTTGGTGGTAGAATG-3′. The PCR temperature profile was 3 min at 95 °C (initial melt) then 20 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 65 °C for 45 cycles, and 30 s at 95 °C for 1 cycle, and 1 min at 55 °C followed by stepwise temperature increases from 55 to 95 °C to generate the melt curve. Standard curves were generated with each primer set by use of untreated control cDNA preparations and a 10-fold dilution series ranging from 1000 ng/ml to 100 pg/ml. PCR efficiencies and relative expression levels of GADD153 and BiP as a function of eEF1α1 expression were calculated as previously described (34Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (24586) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—LS8 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and treated with 2 mm NaF or 0.5 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) for 24 h. Nuclear proteins were extracted by resuspending washed cells in harvest buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 m sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 17.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). After centrifugation, the precipitate was resuspended in buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation, and the protein concentration of nuclear extracts was determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Thirty μg of protein was run on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) were specific for GADD153 (sc-7351, 1:2000) or Xbp-1 (M-186, 1:3000). After incubation with appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse IgG, 1:5000; anti-rabbit IgG, 1:5000, Cell Signaling Technology), specific protein bands were detected and analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence substrate detection (ECL Western blotting analysis system, Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry—LS8 cells were plated in a four-well chamber slide (BD Biosciences). Cells were treated with or without 2 mm NaF for 24 h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibody was either mouse monoclonal anti-GADD153 (sc-7351; Santa Cruz) or antisera specific for Ire1. 2K. Lipson, L. Nguyen, S. Fonseca, E. Foss, R. Bortell, A. Rossini, and F. Urano, submitted for publication. The Vector M.O.M. immunodetection kit (Vector) was used to detect GADD153, and the VectaStain Elite ABC kit (Vector) was used to detect Ire1. The staining procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Inhibition of GADD153 with Short Interfering RNA (siRNA)—siRNA was used to down-regulate GADD153 expression (Qiagen). The siRNA sequence was AACAGAGGTCACACGCACATC. Briefly, LS8 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes (12 ml of medium without antibiotics) and transiently transfected with 0.4 μm siRNA in 3 ml of Opti-MEM with 30 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For 96-well plates LS8 cells were plated at 100 μl/well and transiently transfected with 0.4 μm siRNA in 100 μl of Opti-MEM with 0.25 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. After incubation for 24 h, cells were treated with or without 5 mm NaF for 24 h. Nuclear proteins were extracted as described above and used for Western blot or DNA fragmentation analysis. Overexpression of GADD153—The mouse GADD153 cDNA was present or not (control) in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). GADD153 protein expression was detected by Western blot analysis. Five μg of protein from whole cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE. In brief, cells were plated in 6-well plates and transiently transfected with 0.75 or 1.5 μg of DNA in 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM with 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. After 24 h cells were collected and lysed (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation, and the protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). DNA fragmentation analysis was performed as described above. In Vivo TUNEL Assay and Immunohistochemistry—All animals used in this work were housed in AAALAC-approved facilities, and all operations were performed in accord with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the Forsyth Institute. Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Fluoride at a concentration of 0, 75, or 150 ppm as NaF was delivered ad libitum in the drinking water for 3–4 weeks. Fluoride concentration analyses of chow were performed in duplicate by a modification (36Rojas-Sanchez F. Kelly S.A. Drake K.M. Eckert G.J. Stookey G.K. Dunipace A.J. Community Dent. Oral Epid. 1999; 27: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) of the hexamethyldisiloxane (Sigma) microdiffusion method, and serum fluoride levels were performed by the method of Vogel et al. (37Vogel G.L. Carey C.M. Chow L.C. Brown W.E. J. Dent. Res. 1987; 66: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Incisors were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned. For the TUNEL assay, the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Applied Science) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sections were incubated with anti-fluorescein antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. For immunohistochemistry, sections were incubated in blocking agent (goat serum) for 20 min, in active Ire1α-specific antisera (1:100) overnight, in peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Vectastain Elite Reagent), and in Sigma Fast 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate. Sections were examined by light microscopy for the presence of fragmented DNA and for the presence of active Ire1α. NaF Inhibits LS8 Cell Growth—To establish the concentration of NaF necessary for toxicity of the ameloblast-derived LS8 cell line, we performed cell survival assays. LS8 cells were seeded into 25-cm2 flasks (1000 cells/flask) for 18 h before 24 h of treatment with NaF at concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm. After 8–9 days, the resulting colonies were stained with methylene blue and counted. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and colony counts from the treatment groups were compared with the untreated controls (Fig. 1A). Although the trend started at the lowest dose assayed (0.5 mm), significant levels of cell death were observed at the 1.5 (30%) and 2.0 mm (52%) NaF concentrations (Fig. 1A). Next we quantified LS8 cell proliferation by use of the tetrazolium salt MTT. MTT is reduced to an insoluble formazan dye by mitochondrial enzymes associated with metabolic activity, and the amount of dye formed correlates positively to the number of proliferating cells present. LS8 cells were treated with several concentrations of sodium fluoride of between 0 and 2 mm for either 24 or 48 h followed by assessment of cell proliferation by the MTT assay. Treatment with 0.1 mm NaF (1.9 ppm fluoride) reduced LS8 cell proliferation by about 4%, and a significant reduction in cell proliferation (∼10%) was observed after exposure to 0.2 mm NaF (3.8 ppm fluoride) for 24 h (Fig. 1B). After 48 h of fluoride treatment, the cells appeared to have time to recover from the low dose exposure (0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mm) and proliferate at a slightly higher rate than the 24-h treatment groups. However, at the highest dose (2.0 mm), significantly less proliferation was apparent for the 48-h treatment compared with the 24-h treatment (Fig. 1B). NaF Induces Caspase-mediated DNA Fragmentation in LS8 Cells—DNA fragmentation was quantified by use of an ELISA-based TUNEL assay where adherent cells were assayed for DNA strand breaks. After 48 h of treatment with 2.0 mm NaF, a significant quantity of LS8 DNA strand breaks were observed (Fig. 2A). The addition of the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD eliminated the NaF-induced DNA strand breaks, demonstrating that caspases mediated the DNA fragmentation response. To determine whether z-VAD treatment protected the cells from NaF-induced cell death, we performed trypan blue dye exclusion assays in duplicate for each treatment in three different successive experiments (Fig. 2B). The results demonstrated that z-VAD did not significantly protect LS8 cells from the toxic effects of NaF, indicating that caspases are involved but are not essential for NaF-induced cell death. NaF Induces ER Stress—Because LS8 cells are more sensitive to the antiproliferative rather than the toxic effects of NaF, we asked if NaF induced a cell stress response. GADD genes are induced by growth arrest and DNA damage, so we assessed the expression levels of two GADD genes before and after NaF treatment. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that both GADD153 and GADD45α mRNAs were induced in LS8 cells after NaF exposure. The GADD153 induction was the strongest and increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner that peaked (40–60-fold induction) after 24 h of 2 mm NaF exposure (Fig. 3A). Because GADD153 expression may or may not stem from the ER stress response pathway (26Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C.

BiP is an ER resident molecular chaperone that is thought to prevent protein aggregation while maintaining a protein-folding-competent state (38Kaufman R.J.

https://openalex.org/W1967835933,"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) has recently been shown to participate in the induction of nuclear factor κB (NFκB)-dependent gene expression by the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4). In this study we have examined the mechanism whereby Btk participates in this response. Treatment of the murine monocytic cell line Raw264.7 with LFM-A13, a specific Btk inhibitor, blocked LPS-induced NFκB-dependent reporter gene expression but not IκBα degradation. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells with Btk had no effect on NFκB-dependent reporter gene expression but strongly promoted transactivation of a reporter gene by a p65-Gal4 fusion protein. IκBα degradation activated by LPS was intact in macrophages from X-linked immunodeficiency (Xid) mice, which contain inactive Btk. Transfection of cells with a dominant negative form of Btk (BtkK430R) inhibited LPS-driven p65 mediated transactivation. Additionally LFM-A13 impaired phosphorylation of serine 536 on p65 induced by LPS in HEK293-TLR4 cells, and in Xid macrophages this response was impaired. This study therefore reveals a novel function for Btk. It is required for the signaling pathway activated by TLR4, which culminates in phosphorylation of p65 on serine 536 promoting transactivation by NFκB.

This study therefore reveals a novel function for Btk. It is required for the signaling pathway activated by TLR4, which culminates in phosphorylation of p65 on serine 536 promoting transactivation by NFκB."
https://openalex.org/W2032554800,"Raf-1 protects cells from apoptosis, independently of its signals to MEK and ERK, by translocating to the mitochondria where it binds Bcl-2 and displaces BAD. However, the answer to the question of how Raf-1 is normally lured to the mitochondria and becomes activated remains elusive. p21-activated protein kinases (Paks) are serine/threonine protein kinases that phosphorylate Raf-1 at Ser-338 and Ser-339. Here we elucidate the molecular mechanism through which Pak1 signals to BAD through a Raf-1-activated pathway. Upon phosphorylation by Pak1, Raf-1 translocates to mitochondria and phosphorylates BAD at Ser-112. Moreover, the mitochondrial translocation of Raf-1 and the interaction between Raf-1 and Bcl-2 are regulated by Raf-1 phosphorylation at Ser-338/Ser-339. Notably, we show that formation of a Raf-1-Bcl-2 complex coincides with loss of an interaction between Bcl-2 and BAD. These signals are specific for Pak1, because Src-activated Raf-1 only stimulates the MAP kinase cascade. Thus, our data identify the molecular connections of a Pak1-Raf-1-BAD pathway that is involved in cell survival signaling.

These signals are specific for Pak1, because Src-activated Raf-1 only stimulates the MAP kinase cascade. Thus, our data identify the molecular connections of a Pak1-Raf-1-BAD pathway that is involved in cell survival signaling. Apoptotic stimuli are divided into two broad categories, extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic signals are receptor-mediated and are independent of the mitochondria. Intrinsic signals are mitochondrial dependent and generally activated by stress such as starvation, chemotherapeutic drugs, viral infections, and ionizing irradiation (1Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar, 2Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E209-E216Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The intrinsic pathways converge on the mitochondria to regulate the Bcl-2 proto-oncogene. Bcl-2 protects cells by maintaining the integrity of the mitochondrial barrier and preventing the release of proapoptotic contents such as cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Release of cytochrome c activates a cascade of caspases that ultimately commit cells to apoptosis, whereas AIF promotes apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner (2Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E209-E216Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 is regulated by forming complexes with members of the Bcl-2 family, some of which are protective complexes whereas others are inhibitory complexes. The balance between the Bcl-2 bound in protective complexes and the Bcl-2 bound in inhibitory complexes is thought to be critical in determining whether a cell will survive or undergo apoptosis. Proteins that form protective complexes include the protein kinase Raf-1 and a Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-XL. In contrast, BAD is a Bcl-2 family member that binds to Bcl-2 to form an inhibitory complex. However, if BAD is phosphorylated, it will release Bcl-2 to promote cell survival (3Zha J.H. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). Kinases that phosphorylate BAD include the following: Akt, which phosphorylates serine 136; protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates serines 112 and 155; p90 ribosomal s6 kinase (p90RSK), which also phosphorylates serine 112; c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates serine 128 and threonine 201; and Cdc2, which phosphorylates serine 128 (4Datta S.R.

Whereas MEK remains the most well defined substrate of Raf-1, numerous substrates are phosphorylated by Pak. These include Lim kinase (24Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat.

Activated Pak mutants protect cells from intrinsic apoptotic signals, and dominant negative Pak mutants accelerate apoptosis induced by these signals; but the relevant downstream pathways remain only partly understood. A number of independent reports have shown that multiple Pak isoforms stimulate the phosphorylation of BAD and reduce its binding to Bcl-2 (21Tang Y. Zhou H. Chen A. Pittman R.N. Field J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9106-9109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 22Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H-G. Reed J.-C. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell.

Pak stimulates Raf-1 translocation to the mitochondria, stimulates complexes between Raf-1 and Bcl-2, and inhibits complexes between BAD and Bcl-2. Moreover, Pak phosphorylation of BAD is mediated by Raf-1. Reagents and Plasmids—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. The FuGENE 6 transfection reagent and complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets were from Roche Applied Science. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against BAD, Ser(P)-112, Ser(P)-136, Bcl-xL, ERK, and phospho-ERK were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against Raf-1 and Bcl-2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-Ser(P)-338 Raf-1 antibody, Raf-1 proteins, and an anti-Src monoclonal antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The mouse monoclonal anti-Cox4 antibody and the ApoAlert cell fraction kit were from BD Biosciences Clontech. Anti-phospho-Raf-1 Tyr-340 and the Raf-1 inhibitors GW5074 (5-iodo-3-[(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)methylene]-2-indolinone) and BAY43-9006 as well as rapamycin were from Calbiochem. PD98059, H89, H-33342, a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody, an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, and a FLAG peptide were purchased from Sigma. Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG and MitoTracker Red 580 were from Molecular Probes. Glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Plasmids expressing a Myc-tagged wild-type (WT), a kinase-dead (K299R), and a kinase-activated (T423E) version of Pak1 cloned into the pCMV6 vector have been described elsewhere (27Tang Y. Yu J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The plasmids used to generate GST-BAD (amino acids104–141) fusion proteins, namely GST-BAD WT, GST-BAD S112A, GST-BAD S136A, and GST-BAD S112A/S136A (all cloned into the pGEX-4T-1), were provided by Dr. Stanley Korsmeyer. pBAC-his-hPak1, which expresses a human Pak1 cloned into a baculovirus expression system, was provided by Dr. Jonathan Chernoff. pEBG-BAD, encoding GST-BAD, was purchased from Cell Signaling. Src cDNA (Y529F) in pUSEamp was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. To construct pcDNA-FLAG-Raf-1, human Raf-1 cDNA was amplified by PCR (from pEFH-mRaf-1K375R) and cloned into the BamHI/NotI site of the pcDNA3-FLAG vector. All other plasmids expressing BAD (full-length or amino acids 104–141) and Raf-1 mutants were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The GeneBlocker Bcl-2 siRNA vector mix used to knock down Bcl-2 was purchased from BioVision (Mountain View, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293T and NIH 3T3 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and collected 48 h after transfection. Stable transfected cells were selected by Zeocin (150 μg/ml) for 2 weeks and confirmed by Western blotting. Immunoblot and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were transfected with appropriate vectors. Cell extracts were obtained in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH7.5, 0.15 n NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm vanadate, and 10% glycerol) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the recommended concentration of complete protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was assessed using Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit, and equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P; Millipore Corp.). Blots were blocked 1 h in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20) buffer supplemented with 5% nonfat milk and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing, blots were incubated with secondary antibodies and then detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoprecipitation assay was carried out as follows. Whole cell lysates containing the same amounts of total protein were incubated with monoclonal anti-BAD antibody conjugated beads, GST-beads, and anti-Bcl-2 antibody or M2 beads for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed with the lysis buffer 3 times. Proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× SDS sample buffer or FLAG peptides (M2 beads), subjected to immunoblotting, and then probed with antibodies against Ser(P)-112 BAD, Raf-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL. Protein Kinase Assays—Kinase assays were conducted by incubating a mixture of proteins with the indicated substrates in 1× kinase buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with 5 μm of ATP and, where indicated, 5mCi of [γ-32P] ATP for 30 min at 30 °C in a reaction volume of 25 μl. The reaction was terminated with 1× SDS sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, or Western blot assay. Apoptosis Assay—HEK 293T cells or stable cells were treated and harvested as indicated in the legend to Fig. 5A. Cells were stained with Hoechst (1 μg/ml) for 10 min, followed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were collected by centrifugation and then dropped on a cover slide. Apoptotic cells were identified by nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Cellular Fractionation—HEK 293T cells (10-cm dish) were transfected with pCMV6-Pak1 and pcDNA-FLAG-Raf-1; after 24 h the cells were starved for 16 h with starvation medium. Cellular fractionation was performed using the ApoAlert cell fractionation kit (Clontech) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, washed once with wash buffer, and suspended in 0.8 ml of ice-cold fractionation buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture and dithiothreitol. After incubation on ice for 10 min, cells were homogenized with 60 strokes using a 1-ml Dounce tissue homogenizer. Samples were then transferred to microfuge tubes and centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to separate nuclei and unbroken cells, followed by centrifugation of the supernatant at 10,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C to obtain a mitochondrial-enriched fraction. The cytoplasmic fractions were obtained by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Fractions were then analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blot assays. Immunofluorescence—NIH 3T3 stable cell lines expressing pCMV-6-Pak1WT or pCMV-6-Pak1T423E were seeded in 6-well plates 1 day before transfection. Cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing a Raf-1 WT or a S338A/S339A mutant (1 μg) by using FuGENE 6 as recommended. 8 h after the DNA mixture was added, cells were trypsinized and seeded into a Nunc chamber pre-coated with fibronectin. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 45 min before permeabilization in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Following incubation with 3% bovine serum albumin for 45 min, cells were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-Raf-1-(Ser-338) antibody (1:100) for 2 h, washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse antibody (1:500) for 45 min. Cells were further stained with MitoTracker Red 580 (50 nm) for 20 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted. Photomicrographs were obtained using a Leica Poly-var-2 fluorescence microscope with a Hamamatsu ORCA charge-coupled device camera operated with Open Lab software from Improvision (Lexington, MA). Pak1 Induces Raf-1 Translocation to the Mitochondria—As targeting active Raf-1 to the mitochondria is necessary for cell protection and the phosphorylation of BAD, we tested to determine if Pak1 phosphorylation of Raf-1 stimulates its translocation to mitochondria. We isolated a mitochondria-enriched fraction after transfection with various Raf-1 and Pak1 plasmids (Fig. 1A). K375W is a kinase dead Raf-1 mutant, and S338A/S339A (S338/9A in Fig. 1A) has the Pak phosphorylation sites mutated (26King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The expression levels of the Pak1 and Raf-1 mutants were assessed using an anti-Myc or anti-Raf-1 antibody, whereas the mitochondrial protein Cox4 was used as a marker for the mitochondria. We found that the constitutively activated Pak1 (T423E) stimulated mitochondrial localization of Raf-1 (Fig. 1A, lane 5). Because Pak1 phosphorylates Raf-1 at serine 338, we also probed blots with a phospho-specific Ser-338 antibody and found that the mitochondrial associated Raf-1 was heavily phosphorylated at Ser-338 (Fig. 1A, lane 5). We also noted that Pak1 stimulated mitochondrial translocation of kinase dead Raf-1, K375W (Fig. 1A, lane 7). However, mitochondrial localization of Raf-1 was prevented by serine to alanine mutations at Ser-338 and Ser-339, the Pak phosphorylation sites. These data show that Pak1 stimulates translocation of Raf-1 to mitochondria and that, because the kinase dead Raf-1 was also translocated, Raf-1 activity is not necessary for translocation. To confirm that Pak1 phosphorylation translocated Raf-1 to mitochondria, we carried out immunofluorescence experiments and found that cells expressing activated Pak1 had higher levels of Raf-1 localizing to a perinuclear region where mitochondria are often found as compared with cells expressing wild type Pak1 (Fig. 1C). When cells were stained with the phosphoserine 338 antibody, the phosphorylated Raf-1 was highly enriched in this region, which we identified as mitochondria with MitoTracker dye (Fig. 1B). Additionally, the S338A/S339A mutant Raf-1 yielded a diffuse staining pattern and showed no enrichment in mitochondria (data not shown). Activation of Raf-1 is also accompanied by phosphorylation on multiple residues, including serines 338 and 339 and tyrosines 340 and 341. Tyrosines 340 and 341 are phosphorylated by the Src family of tyrosine kinases, and this pathway is important for some extrinsic survival signals (28Alavi A. Hood J.D. Frausto R. Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Science. 2003; 301: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Thus, we next tested whether Src could stimulate mitochondrial localization of Raf-1. HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with empty vector, Raf-1, or constitutively active Src or Pak1T423E plasmids. Mitochondria-enriched fractions were isolated, and Western blots were performed. We found that activated Src did not stimulate Raf-1 translocation to mitochondria compared with Raf-1 alone, whereas activated Pak1 did (Fig. 1D). The translocation stimulated by Pak1 to the mitochondria was also accompanied by reduced levels of Raf-1 in the cytosol. In this experiment Src phosphorylated Tyr-340 as expected, whereas Pak did not stimulate phosphorylation at this site (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-338/Ser-339, but not of Tyr-340/Tyr-341, is required for Raf-1 mitochondrial localization. Pak1 Phosphorylation of Ser-112 on BAD Requires Raf-1— Transfection of Pak1 or mitochondrial targeting of Raf-1 can stimulate BAD phosphorylation (12Wang H. Rapp U. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 22Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H-G. Reed J.-C. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the possibility that Pak1 stimulates BAD phosphorylation through Raf-1. Cells were co-transfected with pEBG-BAD and an empty vector, kinase dead Pak1, or Pak1T423E, starved to reduce basal phosphorylation, and then probed with a phosphoserine 112 antibody. The expression level of BAD was assessed by Western blotting. Pak1T423E stimulation of Ser-112 phosphorylation was not inhibited by the protein kinase A inhibitor H89, the p70S6K inhibitor rapamycin, or the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 2A). However, the Raf-1 inhibitors BAY43-9006 and GW5074 (5-iodo-3-[(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)methylene]-2-indolinone) (data not shown for GW5074) reduced phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-112 to control levels (Fig. 2A, lane 4). We also assessed the expression and phosphorylation of ERK, a downstream target of the Raf-1 cascade. Pak1 weakly stimulated ERK phosphorylation, whereas ERK phosphorylation was inhibited by both BAY43-9006 and PD98059 (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–5). To exclude the possibility that Raf-1 inhibitors interfere with the protein kinase A pathway, we tested the effect of the Raf-1 inhibitor GW5074 on protein kinase A-induced Ser-112 phosphorylation. HEK 293T cells were transfected with pEBG-BAD for 24 h, starved for 16 h, and pretreated with vehicle (Me2SO), a protein kinase A inhibitor (H89), or the Raf-1 inhibitor for 30 min and then stimulated with forskolin to activate adenylyl cyclase. Western blots showed that forskolin stimulated Ser-112 phosphorylation and that the phosphorylation was reduced by H89 but not by the Raf-1 inhibitor (data not shown). This result demonstrates that the Raf-1 inhibitor does not interfere with protein kinase A phosphorylation of BAD on Ser-112. Together, these experiments implicated Raf-1 as the mediator of the signal from Pak1 to BAD phosphorylation. BAY43-9006 can inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor kinase activity (29Wilhelm S.M. Carter C. Tang L. Wilkie D. McNabola A. Rong H. Chen C. Zhang X. Vincent P. McHugh M. Cao Y. Shujath J. Gawlak S. Eveleigh D. Rowley B. Liu L. Adnane L. Lynch M. Auclair D. Taylor I. Gedrich R. Voznesensky A. Riedl B. Post L.E. Bollag G. Trail P.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7099-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (3525) Google Scholar), whereas GW5074 is not well characterized. Therefore, as an independent means of testing the role of Raf-1 we tested several dominant negative Raf-1 mutants (Fig. 2B). K375W plus S338A/S339A is a kinase dead mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by Pak1. We found that the wild-type Raf-1 alone did not stimulate Ser-112 phosphorylation. However, when Raf-1 was co-transfected with Pak1T423E there was a slight stimulation of Ser-112 phosphorylation over that seen with Pak1T423E alone. Importantly, each of the Raf-1 mutants significantly reduced phosphorylation of Ser-112 by Pak1T423E. The S338/S339A mutant was more effective than the kinase dead Raf-1, whereas the K375W plus S338A/S339A triple mutant was the most effective. Thus, these results further confirm that Pak1 stimulation of BAD phosphorylation requires Raf-1. Pak Specifically Stimulates Raf-1 Phosphorylation of BAD— Targeting active Raf-1 to the outer mitochondrial membrane protects cells from apoptosis and stimulates phosphorylation of BAD, although the mechanism of BAD phosphorylation remains controversial. Although one study suggested that BAD is phosphorylated directly by Raf-1 (12Wang H. Rapp U. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), others found that BAD was a poor substrate for Raf-1 in vitro (14von Gise A. Lorenz P. Wellbrock C. Hemmings B. Berberich-Siebelt F. Rapp U.R. Troppmair J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2324-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). One possibility is that cofactors direct Raf-1 toward BAD. To assess if Pak1 may be a cofactor responsible for determining the specificity of Raf-1 toward BAD, we tested the effects of Pak1 on Raf-1 phosphorylation of BAD in transfections and in vitro. We found that when Pak1 and Raf-1 were co-transfected into cells and Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated, the immunoisolated Raf-1 stimulated phosphorylation of BAD at serine 112 (Fig. 3A, lane 3, top section). However, BAD phosphorylation was diminished when Raf-1 mutants were tested. We also observed stimulation of ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3A, bottom section) when ERK phosphorylation was measured in a coupled MEK/ERK assay, confirming previous reports that Pak cooperates with Raf-1 in the ERK cascade (25Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 27Tang Y. Yu J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Raf-1 is also activated by tyrosine kinases such as Src through phosphorylation of Tyr-340 and Tyr-341 (30Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether Src-stimulated Raf-1 phosphorylates BAD at Ser-112. When Raf-1 was treated with Src, only MEK phosphorylation was stimulated (Fig. 3B, bottom section). Src-stimulated Raf-1 did not phosphorylate BAD (Fig. 3B, top section). We also performed assays in vitro using recombinant proteins. When we measured BAD phosphorylation with the Ser-112 phospho-specific antibody, phosphorylation was very weak and almost undetectable when either Raf-1 or Pak1 was tested alone (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 3). Detailed in vitro studies confirmed that Pak1 phosphorylated BAD poorly at Ser-112 and preferred other sites (data not shown). However, in the presence of both Raf-1 and Pak1 a robust phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 3C, lane 4). To compare the relative activities of Pak1 and Src in this system, we determined the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of a Raf-1-derived peptide, RPRGQRDSSYYWEIE, containing Ser-338/Ser-339 and Tyr-340 (Fig. 3E). Pak1 stimulated incorporation of 1.2 mol of phosphate per mol of peptide, whereas Src stimulated incorporation of 0.84 mol of phosphate per mol of peptide (Fig. 3E, lanes 3 and 5). Pak1 failed to phosphorylate a control peptide with Ser-338/Ser-339 mutated to alanines, whereas Src phosphorylated the peptide as well as it phosphorylated the wild type peptide (Fig. 3E). To mimic Src activation, we tested to determine if an active Raf-1 mutant lacking residues 1–306 and containing Y340D/Y341D mutations can phosphorylate BAD in vitro. This active Raf-1 stimulated MEK/ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3D) but not BAD phosphorylation (Fig. 3C, lane 5). Again, however, a robust phosphorylation of Ser-112 was detected when the mutant was tested in combination with Pak1 (Fig. 3D, lane 6), suggesting that Pak1 phosphorylation of Ser-338 and Ser-339 is required for Raf-1 phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-112, whereas Src does not contribute to Raf-1 phosphorylation of BAD. Pak1 Promotes Bcl-2 Protective Complexes—One of the mitochondrial proteins associated with protective signals from Raf-1 is Bcl-2, which forms a complex with Raf-1 although it is not phosphorylated by Raf-1. Because Pak1 stimulated mitochondrial localization of Raf-1, we reasoned that Pak1 might be stimulating the formation of complexes between Raf-1 and Bcl-2 at the mitochondria. To test this possibility, we transfected HEK 293T cells with activated Pak1 and WT Raf-1. After transfection, cells were lysed and fractionated to isolate the mitochondria-enriched fractions. We performed immunoprecipitations with the anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated beads (M2 beads"

Impairment of cellmigration and proliferation may partially explain the delay of epithelialwound healing in lumican-null mice. Recent reports have also showed delayedepithelial-mesenchymal transition in lumican-null mice. Lumican-null mouselens epithelial cells showed decreased α-smooth muscle actin expressionand the delayed epithelial-mesenchymal transition induction by transforminggrowth factor β-2 in vitro(18Saika S.

Chapes S.K. Conrad G.W. InvestOphthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 1159-1167PubMed Google Scholar). These observationsdemonstrate lumican to have multiple functions, and it may serve as amatrikine in regulating cellular activities via interaction with integrinand/or growth factor receptors besides serving as a component of ECM, similarto what has been suggested for many other ECM components(23Swindle C.S.

Keratan sulfate-containing proteoglycans (KSPGs) are uniquely abundant inthe cornea and have long been thought to be essential for cornealtransparency. Lumican constitutes only about half of corneal KSPG. Most of theremaining corneal keratan sulfate modifies keratocan, a protein with highsequence similarity to lumican. In adult tissues, keratocan is limited tocorneal stroma, and keratocan expression is considered a phenotypic marker forkeratocytes. Lumican-null (Lum–/–) micemanifest corneal opacity, skin fragility, and impaired collagenfibrillogenesis (1Chakravarti S. Magnuson T. Lass J.H. Jepsen K.J. LaMantia C. Carroll H. J.

Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because of the highdegree of similarity in amino acid sequence, post-translational modification,corneal localization, and apparent function, there has been no immediatelyapparent explanation for the different outcomes resulting from the ablation ofLum and Kera genes. In the current study, we have approached the question as to the function ofthe KSPG in the cornea by overexpressing lumican in the corneal stroma of themouse. This experiment explores the potential of a stoichiometric relationshipbetween corneal collagen KSPG. The results indicate that the presence ofexcess lumican does not have any adverse effects on corneal morphogenesis,collagen organization, or corneal transparency. However, using a number ofdifferent experimental approaches, lumican expression was found to exert adirect effect on the expression of keratocan. These findings provide a newexplanation for the differences of clinical manifestations in corneas ofLum–/– andKera–/– mice and document a novel cellularregulatory function of lumican. Preparation of Kera-Lum Transgenic Mice—Twooligonucleotides, a 5′ ClaI (CCA TCG ATG CCA CCA TGG AGA CAG AC) primerand a 3′ SalI (ACG CGT CGA CCA GAT CCT CTT CTG AGA TG) primer, weresynthesized by the University of Cincinnati DNA core facility (Cincinnati, OH)and used to generate lumican cDNA using 100 ng of pSecLum as a template in astandard PCR (28Carlson E.C.

A schematic of this construct is shown inFig. 1A. TheKera-Lum minigene was released by FspI and SacII digestion and usedfor pronuclei injection of fertilized mouse eggs by the Cincinnati Children'sHospital Research Foundation Transgenic Core Facility (Cincinnati, OH). Toidentify transgenic mice, tail DNA from mice was used for genotype analysis byPCR with a forward Ktn9 (5′-CCT AAC ACC AGC CAC AGG ACT) and a reverseBGH (5′-TAG AAG GCA CAG TCG AGG) primer pair using the following PCRcycle: 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min for 35cycles, and 72 °C for 10 min. RT-PCR—RNA was extracted from transgenic mouse cornea usingTRI-reagent™ (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) according tothe manufacturer's recommendations. Reagents used in this assay, unlessotherwise specified, were from Promega (Madison, WI). cDNA was synthesized ina 200-μl reaction mixture containing 40 μl of 5× reversetranscription buffer, 20 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 8 μl of25 mm dNTPs, 10 μl of Rnasin (40 units/μl), 10 μl ofrandom hexamers (50 μm) (Amersham Biosciences), 10 μl ofavian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (9.5 units/μl), and 10μg of heat-denatured corneal total RNA extracts from transgenic mousecorneas. Diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water was added to bring the finalreaction volume to 200 μl. The reaction was then incubated sequentially at22 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 90 min, and 100 °C for 2 min and thenimmediately placed on ice. A 20-μl aliquot of the described reversetranscription reactions was added to 80 μl of a PCR mixture containing 8μl of 10× PCR buffer (no MgCl2), 8 μl of 25mm MgCl2, 10 μl of 20 ng/μl primers (Ktn9,5′-CCT AAC ACC AGC CAC AGG ACT; BGH, 5′TAG AAG GCA CAG TCG AGG),0.5 μl of Taq polymerase (5 units/μl), and 45.5 μl ofdouble-distilled H2O. The PCR was performed for 35 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles,followed by a 5-min extension time at 72 °C at the end of 35 cycles.

Corneas were then homogenized using a Tissuemizer®(Tekmar, Cincinnati, OH) three times for 30 s each time. After homogenization,samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight. Following this incubation, thesamples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was dialyzed againstdouble-distilled H2O overnight at 4 °C in a dialysis bag.Precipitates were collected by centrifugation, air-dried for 10 min, andresuspended in 100 μl of 6 m urea in 0.1 m Trisacetate, pH 7.4. The samples were then centrifuged, supernatants werecollected, and optical densities were measured with a spectrophotometer at 280nm. Routinely, about 7–10 μg of total protein could be extracted fromeach cornea. Samples were then digested with 0.1 unit/mlendo-β-galactosidase (Sigma) at 37 °C overnight.

In Vivo Confocal Microscopy—In vivo confocal microscopythrough focusing (CMTF) was used to measure corneal epithelial thickness,stromal thickness, and corneal haze in the nontransgenic, Lum38, andLum5 transgenic mice (three animals for each group). Mice wereinitially anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine HCl (100 mg/kgbody weight, Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) and xylazine (10 mg/kg bodyweight, Akorn, Inc., Decatur, IL). Eyelids were then held open using tape, andthe central cornea was scanned using a tandem scanning confocal microscope(Tandem Scanning Corp., Reston, VA) equipped with a ×24 surface contactobjective (numerical aperture = 0.6, working distance = 1.5 mm). Thickness andlight scattering measurements were obtained using previously describedtechniques(31Jester J.V. Ghee L.Y. Li J. Chakravarti S. Paul J. Petroll W.M. Dwight C.H.

CMTF collects a series ofdigital, two-dimensional images through the cornea at known intervals that canlater be reconstructed to generate a three-dimensional image from whichquantitative measurements of corneal sublayer thickness and light scatteringcan be obtained. Three CMTF scans in the forward, anterior to posterior,direction were obtained from the right eye of each animal. Depth intensityprofiles were then generated, and thickness measurements for the epitheliumand stroma were then obtained using previously published formulas(32Jester J.V. Petroll W.M. Cavanagh H.D.

To assess lightscattering, the area under the pixel intensity curve(Uauc) corresponding to the corneal stroma was integratedto estimate of backscattering light using previously published techniques(33Li J.

The average epithelialthickness, stromal thickness, and corneal haze were calculated from threeseparate z-scans from the same eye, and then the mean and S.D. fromthree separate animals were calculated. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Corneas from three mice perline were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Briefly, the corneaswere fixed in situ in 4% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, with 8.0 mmCaCl2 for 2 h (8Birk D.E. Trelstad R.L.

After dehydration in an ethanolseries, followed by propylene oxide, the corneas were infiltrated and embeddedin a mixture of EMbed 812, nadic methyl anhydride, dodecenyl succinicanhydride, and DMP-30 (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Thin sections were cutusing a Reichert UCT ultramicrotome and a diamond knife and stained with 2%aqueous uranyl acetate, 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 3.2. Sections taken fromthe central cornea and the anterior and posterior stroma were analyzedindependently using electron microscopy. Sections were examined andphotographed at 75 kV using a Hitachi 7000 transmission electronmicroscope. Fibril diameter analyses were done for the nontransgenic and transgeniclines. For each line, fibril diameters were measured in micrographs fromnonoverlapping regions of the anterior and posterior stroma from the centraltaken at ×31,680. Micrographs were randomly chosen in a masked mannerfrom the different groups and digitized, and diameters were measured using aRM Biometrics-Bioquant Image Analysis System (Memphis, TN). Northern Hybridization—Total RNA was extracted from twomouse corneas using TRI-reagent™ (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati,OH). Ten μg of total RNA were subjected to Northern blot hybridization with32P-labeled mouse keratocan cDNA probe as described previously(35Liu C.Y. Shiraishi A. Kao C.W. Converse R.L. Funderburgh J.L.

Four days followinginstrastromal injection, corneas were excised (n = 4), and reportergene activity was measured. β-GEO reporter analysis was performed using aβ-galactosidase enzyme assay kit (Promega, Madison WI) according to themanufacturer's protocol. In brief, corneal total extracts were isolated byhomogenization with a Polytron® homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments,Westbury, NY) in 0.5 ml of reporter lysis buffer included in the kit.

https://openalex.org/W2149467125,"Previous research suggests that synchronous neural activity underlies perceptual grouping of visual image features. The generality of this mechanism is unclear, however, as previous studies have focused on pairs of neurons with overlapping or collinear receptive fields. By sampling more broadly and employing stimuli that contain partially occluded objects, we have conducted a more incisive test of the binding by synchrony hypothesis in area MT. We find that synchrony in spiking activity shows little dependence on feature grouping, whereas gamma band synchrony in field potentials can be significantly stronger when features are grouped. However, these changes in gamma band synchrony are small relative to the variability of synchrony across recording sites and do not provide a robust population signal for feature grouping. Moreover, these effects are reduced when stimulus differences nearby the receptive fields are eliminated using partial occlusion. Our findings suggest that synchrony does not constitute a general mechanism of visual feature binding."

Here we report structure-function studies that help define the MyD88 TIR domain binding sites involved in IL1β-induced protein-protein interactions. The MyD88 TIR domain, employed as a dominant negative inhibitor of IL1β signaling to screen MyD88 TIR mutants, lost its suppressing activity upon truncation of its Box 3.

Surprisingly, two members of this family recognize key inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) 1 and IL18. These cytokines induce genes that encode other mediators of inflammation such as pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine IL6 and interferon γ, respectively (1Dinarello C.A. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 2002; 20: S1-S13PubMed Google Scholar, 2Yamamoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 3Akira S. Sato S. Scand. J. Infect.

Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these studies, IL1β is one of the most potent inflammatory cytokines responsible for fever, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and production of IL6 and other cytokines (1Dinarello C.A. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 2002; 20: S1-S13PubMed Google Scholar, 2Yamamoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 3Akira S. Sato S. Scand. J.

The signals generated by IL1β binding to its cognate receptor complex, formed by two type I transmembrane proteins, IL1 receptor I (IL1RI) and IL1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAcP), are transduced by their cytoplasmic segments denoted as the Toll/IL1 receptor (TIR) domain. TIR domain is shared with Drosophila Toll, mammalian TLRs, and cytoplasmic adaptors exemplified by MyD88 (6McGettrick A.F. O'Neill L.A. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). MyD88 adaptor integrates signals flowing from IL1 receptor/IL1RAcP and from an array of other TLRs (6McGettrick A.F. O'Neill L.A. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38105-38108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). This initial IL1 receptor-MyD88 adaptor interaction evoked by IL1β is a critical step in its signaling to the nucleus and, therefore, represents a potential target for new anti-inflammatory agents. MyD88 has a bipartite structure composed of an amino-terminal Death domain and a carboxyl-terminal TIR domain with a short intervening linker segment (6McGettrick A.F. O'Neill L.A. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Upon IL1β stimulation, IL1RI·IL1RAcP complex recruits MyD88 via its TIR domain (8Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). In addition, IL1RI-associated kinases are recruited to an IL1RI·IL1RAcP complex including IRAK (9Wesche H. Korherr C. Kracht M. Falk W. Resch K. Martin M.U. J. Biol.

Here we report studies that help to establish the molecular determinants of MyD88 TIR domain interactions in IL1β signaling pathway. In terms of its structural features, the MyD88 TIR domain contains three highly conserved motifs denoted Box 1, 2, and 3 (Figs. 1 and 2). Box 2 forms a loop denoted the BB loop that contains an invariant proline residue at position 200, which, in other receptors and adaptors (namely, TLR2, TLR4, IL1RAcP, and MAL/TIRAP), is essential for their signaling function (6McGettrick A.F. O'Neill L.A. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38105-38108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). For example, mutating this residue to histidine in TLR4 renders C3H/HeJ mice hyporesponsive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (14Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D.

This canonical example indicates that conserved structural motifs in TIR domain of TLRs and their adaptors play a highly significant role in proinflammatory ligand-initiated intracellular interactions between TLRs and their adaptors. Depending on the recognition of distinct ligands by TLRs, the preferential usage of its adaptors may require different interacting sites in TIR domain of the same adaptor or an alternative adaptor. The latter applies to TLR3, which requires its adaptor, TRIF, rather than MyD88 for signaling by viral double-stranded RNA. Conversely, TRIF mediates signaling induced by interaction of LPS with TLR4 in the absence of MyD88 (7Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38105-38108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that signaling evoked by IL1β through its cognate receptor complex may depend on different interactive sites on TIR domain of MyD88 than the recently reported sites involved in MyD88 interaction with TIR domains of TLR2 and TLR4 (15Dunne A.

Within these three boxes, we focused on residues representing AA loop, BB loop, and EE loop that were reported to participate in interactions of MyD88 with TLR2 and TLR4 (15Dunne A. Ejdeback M.

The functional consequences of this mutational analysis were monitored by NFκB-dependent reporter gene activity and by IL1β-induced expression of the endogenous gene that encodes inflammatory cytokine IL6. Our structure-function studies of MyD88 TIR domain led to the development of a three-dimensional docking model of MyD88 and IL1RAcP interaction mediated by their respective TIR domains. Maintenance and Treatment of Cell Lines—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells and human fibroblast MRC-5 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HEK 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum containing no detectable LPS (<6 pg/ml) as determined by the manufacturer (Atlanta Biological, Norcross, GA), l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). MRC-5 cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Plasmids and Reagents—The NFκB-luciferase reporter construct (NFκB-luc) containing five κB elements was provided by Dean Ballard (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). The Renilla thymidine kinase luciferase reporter construct (RL-TK luc) was purchased from Promega. The AU1-tagged MyD88-expressing plasmid was a gift from Marta Muzio (Mario Negri Institute, Milan, Italy) (16Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). All MyD88-TIR constructs were cloned into pcDNA3.1. An AU1 tag or a Myc tag was introduced at the amino terminus of MyD88 or MyD88-TIR by PCR. IL1RAcP with a Myc tag at the amino terminus was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR into pcDNA3.1. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Mutagenesis—The mutated MyD88 and MyD88 TIR domain sequences were generated using an in vitro site-directed PCR mutagenesis method and subcloned into plasmid pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) as described previously (17Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR was utilized with a supercoiled double-stranded DNA template and two synthetic complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation and followed by removal of methylated parental DNA template with DpnI. The nicked DNA containing the desired mutations was transformed into the DH5α strain of competent Escherichia coli. All the mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing and subsequently tested in transiently transfected HEK 293T cells. Transient Transfection of HEK 293T Cells and NFκB Reporter Gene Activity—The cDNAs for all MyD88 and MyD88 TIR domain mutants were inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector that drives transcription from a cytomegalovirus promoter enhancer and contains an AU1 epitope tag for immunodetection of transiently expressed mutants in HEK 293T cells. Transfection of HEK 293T cells was performed with the indicated cDNAs by a conventional calcium phosphate method. One day before transfection, cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105 ml–1/100-mm plate. After 18 h, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium, and after 24 h, the cells were treated as indicated, harvested, and submitted to subsequent analysis. When the cells were stimulated with IL1β, the culture medium was replaced by fresh medium containing IL1β (CellSciences, Canton, MA) at 10 ng/ml or as indicated otherwise and either further cultured for 6 h or left untreated for the indicated period of time. For NFκB reporter gene activity assay, HEK 293T cells co-transfected with NFκB-luc and RL-TK luc plasmids were harvested and submitted to subsequent dual-luciferase assay according to manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Western Blotting and Indirect Immunofluorescence—To check the protein expression after transient transfection, HEK 293T cells were seeded (2.5 × 105 ml–1) onto 100-mm dishes 24 h prior to transfection with combinations of plasmids (20 μg, total) or as indicated, using calcium phosphate method. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were washed by the addition of 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed on ice for 10 min in lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml–1 leupeptin. Cell lysate proteins (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by Western blotting. Monoclonal antibodies against the epitope tags c-Myc and AU1 were obtained from Covance Company (Princeton, NJ). For indirect immunofluorescence, 105 transfected HEK 293T cells were cytocentrifuged onto a glass slide and fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min and then probed with anti-AU1 antibody followed by Rhodamine Red-X-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab, West Grove, PA) as described previously (18Lin Y.Z.

Slides with stained cells were mounted in Poly/Mount (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) and analyzed in an Olympus fluorescence microscope using a ×100 oil immersion lens. Measurement of IL6 Expression Using Cytometric Bead Array Assay—One million MRC-5 cells were transfected with Cell Line Nucleofector Kit R (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) program U23, following the manufacturer's protocol. After 8 h, cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and fresh media were added. Cells were stimulated with IL1β for 6 h, and culture medium was collected and analyzed for production of cytokine IL6. Analysis of IL1β-induced expression of cytokine IL6 in human fibroblast MRC-5 cells was performed using the Human Inflammation Kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoprecipitation—HEK 293T cells were plated at the density of 5 × 106 cells/100-mm plate. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with either (a)10 μg of Myc-IL1RAcP and 10 μg of AU1-MyD88 or MyD88 mutants or (b)10 μg of Myc-MyD88 and 10 μg of AU1-TIR or TIR mutants using calcium phosphate method. Fresh medium was added 18 h later, and cells were incubated for 24 h. In co-immunoprecipitation of IL1RAcP and MyD88, the cells were treated with 100 ng/ml IL1β for 5 min. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 400 μl of hypotonic gentle lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotinin, and 1 μm leupeptin). Lysates were initially precleared with normal mouse serum in combination with protein A-Sepharose 4 fast flow beads (Amersham Biosciences), and then 200 μg of lysate was incubated with 10 μg of anti-Myc at 4 °C overnight. Protein A-Sepharose 4 fast flow slurry (10 μl) was added and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed eight times with 0.5 ml of wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotinin, and 1 μm leupeptin). Beads were resuspended in 20 μlof2× Laemmli buffer. The samples were fractionated on 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and subjected to immunoblotting analysis with anti-AU1 antibody. As a control, 50 μg of total cell lysate was applied to Western blot with both anti-c-Myc and anti-AU1 antibodies. Modeling Studies—The three-dimensional models of MyD88 TIR and IL1RAcP TIR domains were established by a comparative (homology) computation modeling method using Swiss-Model: An Automated Comparative Protein Modeling Server (swissmodel.expasy.org//SWISSMODEL.html) (19Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar, 20Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). At least six Protein Data Bank records are available within known three-dimensional structure of TIR domain from highly homologous members of human TLR family. TIR domain of TLR2 with 31% alignment identity and >50% similarity (21Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) was used for comparative modeling of MyD88 TIR domain (Protein Data Bank code 1O77). TIR domain of TLR1 with 33% identity and 66% similarity (22Tao X. Xu Y. Zheng Y. Beg A.A. Tong L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was used to generate the three-dimensional model of IL1RAcP (Protein Data Bank code 1FYV). All modeling processes were done in four steps: template selection (BLASTP2), target-template alignment (SIM), model building (ProModII), and energy minimization (GROMOS96). Templates, selected by sequence identity with the target sequence, were then prepared to create the core of the model by averaging of the backbone atom positions. Atoms with significantly deviating position were excluded from modeling process. The Constraint Space Programming (CSP) protocol was used for generation of insertion coordinates. The best loop was selected using a score scheme including force field energy, steric hindrance, and specific or nonspecific interaction, i.e. hydrogen bond formation or dipole-dipole interaction. Side chains were reconstructed by weighting positions of corresponding residues in the template structure and their iso-steric replacement. The final model was optimized by steepest descent energy minimization with GROMOS96. The visualizations of the three-dimensional model were performed with the DeepView (Swiss-PdbViewer) freeware program, available for download from the Swiss-Model webpage. The Three-dimensional Docking Model of MD88 TIR and IL1RAcP TIR Interaction—Many aspects, such as molecular surface, geometry, surface topology, charge distribution, electrostatic field, and residue localization, were considered before an arrangement was constructed. First, a possible position of two interacting TIR domains was prepared manually in stereoviewed mode with the PSSHOW program (SYBYL-Tripos package). When the proper position was chosen, computation was conducted by merging receptor (IL1RAcP-TIR) into adaptor (MyD88-TIR), coordinates of the backbone atoms were then frozen, and the heavy atom aggregate was created and optimized. In the next step, hydrogen atoms were added, and the final model was optimized by energy minimization followed by molecular dynamics. Both steps were performed with the SANDER program (AMBER software package) using integral Newtonian equation of motion with 2000 cycles each. Once the computation process was completed, the coordinates were transformed into a Protein Data Bank file. The three-dimensional docking models of dot-surface and contact surface were obtained with PSSHOW software. The ribbon structure of docking model was prepared with DeepView (Swiss-PdbViewer). Statistical Analysis—Statistical differences between mean values were analyzed using the two-sided Student's t test. The IL1β signaling pathway depends on an orchestrated interplay of intracellular protein-protein interactions (1Dinarello C.A. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 2002; 20: S1-S13PubMed Google Scholar, 2Yamamoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 3Akira S. Sato S. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 35: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). MyD88 plays a pivotal role in these interactions by directing the flow of signals from IL1β-occupied cognate receptor complex to downstream signal transducers (2Yamamoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 3Akira S. Sato S. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 35: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Within MyD88, the TIR domain provides an interacting surface for heterotypic interaction with the TIR domain of IL1RAcP (3Akira S. Sato S. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 35: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Therefore, we embarked on structure-function analysis of MyD88 TIR domain that is essential for the transduction of IL1β signaling to downstream effector(s). Our stepwise strategy consisted of analysis of the secondary and tertiary structure of MyD88 TIR domain. These data were obtained on the basis of the available crystal structure of TLR2 TIR domain (21Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Drawing from these modeling studies, two series of mutagenesis experiments were carried out. In the first set of experiments, construct containing only TIR domain of MyD88, as its dominant negative inhibitor, was mutated, and the expressed mutants were screened for their inhibitory effect on IL1β-induced signaling to the nucleus. In the second set of experiments, selected TIR residues were mutated in full-length MyD88 to assess the impact of specific replacements on heterotypic interaction of MyD88 with IL1RAcP and homotypic MyD88 oligomerization mediated by its TIR domain. The results of this structure-function analysis led us to the development of the three-dimensional docking model of MyD88 interaction with IL1RAcP mediated by their respective TIR domains. Structural Characterization of MyD88 TIR Domain—MyD88 TIR domain is modeled on the basis of the crystal structure solved for TLR2 (21Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It has an α-β-fold similar to that of the bacterial chemotaxis protein CheY and contains three highly conserved motifs termed Boxes 1, 2, and 3 (3Akira S. Sato S. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 35: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). On the basis of primary structure alignment obtained with the program T-COFFEE, presented in Fig. 1, the crystal structure of human TLR2 TIR domain (Protein Data Bank code 1O77) was selected as the best template for MyD88 TIR domain with 31% identity and >50% similarity. Results obtained from the server were visualized using the DeepView program (Swiss-PdbViewer). As shown in Fig. 2, the secondary structure of TIR domain consists of five β-strands (βA, βB, βC, βD, and βE) forming the core of molecule that is surrounded by five α-helices (αA, αB, αC, αD, and αE). The five loops (AA, BB, CC, DD, and FF) form specific links between β-strand and corresponding α-helix. In terms of its tertiary structure, as depicted in Fig. 2, MyD88 TIR domain has a globular shape. Among three highly conserved motifs, Box 1, located at the amino terminus of TIR domain, forms a part of βA-strand. Box 2 makes the second part of the BB loop, whereas Box 3 creates the first part of the αE-helix, which is located at the carboxyl terminus of MyD88 TIR domain. As shown in Fig. 2B, distribution of charged residues indicates that the molecular surface of MyD88 TIR domain is mostly positively charged (blue), with a few distinct negatively charged knobs (red). They surround a larger swatch of negatively charged surface (red), formed by three loops (AA, BB, and part of DD) and αC-helix. Moreover, the BB loop projects from the globular TIR domain, forming a quasi-plane on its surface. NFκB Reporter Gene Activity Assay Indicates that Box 3 of MyD88 TIR Domain Is Involved in IL1β-induced Signaling— NFκB reporter gene activity assay was used to test MyD88 TIR domain as a dominant negative inhibitor of IL1β-induced signaling to the nucleus. As documented in Fig. 3, HEK 293T cells transfected with plasmid containing NFκB-dependent luciferase gene responded to sub-nanogram doses of IL1β. This activation reached the maximum at 1 ng/ml IL1β, attesting to the high sensitivity of transfected HEK 293T cells to this inflammatory cytokine. Consistent with prior studies (23Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol.

We engineered a deletion mutant of MyD88 TIR domain to establish the utility of the NFκB reporter gene activity assay for screening MyD88 TIR domain mutants for their inhibitory effect on IL1β-induced signaling. The deleted segment encompassed Box 3 (282KSWF-WTRLAK291) located at the carboxyl terminus of MyD88 TIR domain. This deletion caused the loss of the dominant negative inhibitory function of MyD88 TIR (Fig. 3B), suggesting that Box 3 was essential for IL1β-induced signaling. The carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant was expressed in transfected cells at a level comparable with that of the intact MyD88 TIR domain (see Fig. 3B, inset). Mutagenesis of MyD88 TIR Domain: Loss of Its Dominant Negative Inhibitory Activity toward IL1β-induced Signaling— The involvement of Box 3, as compared with Boxes 1 and 2, in signaling induced by IL1β and mediated by the MyD88 TIR domain was analyzed in the first series of mutagenesis experiments. Mutations of TIR domain (residues 152–296) included two bulky hydrophobic residues (Phe285 and Trp286) in a highly conserved short motif in Box 3 (SWFWTRL) and proline at position 200. The canonical P712H mutation in TLR4 renders C3H/HeJ mice hyporesponsive to LPS (14Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar). This highly conserved proline residue is located at position 200 in the MyD88 TIR domain (15Dunne A. Ejdeback M. Ludidi P.L. O'Neill L.A. Gay N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41443-41451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It was mutated to histidine in MyD88-TIR domain (residues 152–296 (P200H)). Furthermore, alignment of members of the TLR family reveals two short motifs in Box 1 (PERFDAF) and Box 2 (DRDVLPG) that are conserved along with Box 3 motif in MyD88 TIR domain. Alanine substitutions were primarily based on selection of charged residues either in the conserved region or predicted to be on the surface. In addition, two mutations, Val204 and Gln229, were in the region predicted to interact with MAL (15Dunne A. Ejdeback M. Lud"
https://openalex.org/W2170671189,"Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, is capable of inducing the large scale membrane ruffling required for the bacterial invasion of host cells. Shigella secrete a subset of effectors via the type III secretion system (TTSS) into the host cells to induce membrane ruffling. Here, we show that IpgB1 is secreted via the TTSS into epithelial cells and plays a major role in producing membrane ruffles via stimulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 activities, thus promoting bacterial invasion of epithelial cells. The invasiveness of the ipgB1 mutant was decreased to less than 50% of the wild-type level (100%) in a gentamicin protection or plaque forming assay. HeLa cells infected with the wild-type or a IpgB1-hyperproducing strain developed membrane ruffles, with the invasiveness and the scale of membrane ruffles being comparable with the level of IpgB1 production in bacteria. Upon expression of EGFP-IpgB1 in HeLa cells, large membrane ruffles are extended, where the EGFP-IpgB1 was predominantly associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. The IpgB1-mediated formation of ruffles was significantly diminished by expressing Rac1 small interfering RNA and Cdc42 small interfering RNA or by treatment with GGTI-298, an inhibitor of the geranylgeranylation of Rho GTPases. When IpgB1 was expressed in host cells or wild-type Shigella-infected host cells, Rac1 and Cdc42 were activated. The results thus indicate that IpgB1 is a novel Shigella effector involved in bacterial invasion of epithelial cells via the activation of Rho GTPases.

IntroductionShigella are highly adapted human pathogens and are the cause of bacillary dysentery. The prominent pathogenic feature of Shigella is the ability to invade a variety of cells during infection of the intestinal mucosa, including enterocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. When Shigella reach the colon, they translocate through the epithelial barrier via the M cells that overlie solitary lymphoid nodules. Once they reach the underlying M cells, Shigella invade the resident macrophages, and the infecting bacteria escape from the phagosome into the cytoplasm. Shigella multiply in the macrophage cytoplasm and finally induce cell death (1Zychlinsky A. Prevost M.C. Sansonetti P.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 2Suzuki T. Nakanishi K. Tsutsui H. Iwai H. Akira S. Inohara N. Chamaillard M. Nuñez G. Sasakawa C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14042-14050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Shigella released from the dead macrophages enter the surrounding enterocytes through their basolateral surface by inducing large scale membrane ruffling. As soon as a bacterium is surrounded by a membrane vacuole, it immediately disrupts the vacuole membrane and escapes into the cytoplasm. Shigella multiply in the cytoplasm and move about by inducing actin polymerization at one pole of the bacterium, by which the pathogen moves within the cytoplasm as well as into the adjacent cells (3Cossart P. Sansonetti P.J. Science. 2004; 304: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of bacteria to enter the colonic epithelial cells is essential for colonization within the intestinal epithelium.For bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, Shigella (and Salmonella) use a special mechanism called the “trigger mechanism of entry,” which is characterized by macropinocytic and phagocytic events that allow cells to trap several bacterial particles simultaneously (4Sasakawa C. Lamont R. Bacterial Invasion of Host Cells. 5. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2004: 25-57Google Scholar). When Shigella comes into contact with epithelial cells, the type III secretion system (TTSS) 1The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type III secretion system; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding domain; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; FCS, fetal calf serum; CR, Congo red; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; MOI, multiplicity of infection; GGTI, geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor; FTI, farnesyltransferase inhibitor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; WT, wild type; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; LPS, lipopolysaccharide. is stimulated and delivers the effectors into the host cells and surrounding bacterial space (5Blocker A. Komoriya K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3027-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The secreted effectors are capable of modulating various host functions engaged in remodeling the surface architecture of the host cell and escape from the host innate defense systems (4Sasakawa C. Lamont R. Bacterial Invasion of Host Cells. 5. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2004: 25-57Google Scholar, 6Ogawa M. Yoshimori T. Suzuki T. Sagara H. Mizushima N. Sasakawa C. Science. 2005; 307: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Studies have indicated that several Shigella effectors, including IpaA, IpaB, IpaC, IpgD, and VirA, secreted via the TTSS are involved in stimulating the reorganization of F-actin and microtubule cytoskeletons that trigger the bacterial uptake by host cells. IpaB, for example, is capable of binding to the hyaluronic acid receptor CD44 (7Skoudy A. Mounier J. Aruffo A. Ohayon H. Gounon P. Sansonetti P. Tran Van Nhieu G. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The IpaB-CD44 binding occurring within rafts (8van der Goot F.G. Tran Van Nhieu G. Allaoui A. Sansonetti P. Lafont F. J.

IpaC is capable of leading to the activation of Cdc42 and Rac1, since IpaC can be integrated into the host cytoplasmic membrane, which somehow leads to the recruitment of cortactin and activation of c-Src, thus promoting local actin polymerization (3Cossart P. Sansonetti P.J. Science. 2004; 304: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 11Tran Van Nhieu G. Enninga J. Sansonetti P. Grompone G. Curr. Opin.

VirA delivered from Shigella into the vicinity of the bacterial entry site induces local degradation of the microtubules (15Yoshida S. Katayama E. Kuwae A. Mimuro H. Suzuki T. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2923-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), thus resulting in the release of microtubule-associated host proteins, including GEF-H1. The release of GEF-H1 is assumed to lead to the activation of Rac1 via cross-talk with RhoA (16Yoshida S. Sasakawa C. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 139-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Matsuzawa T. Kuwae A. Yoshida S. Sasakawa C. Abe A.

IpgD possesses phosphatidylinositol phosphatase activity that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into phosphatidylinositol 5-monophosphate, thereby promoting local actin dynamics around the bacterial entry site (19Niebuhr K. Giuriato S. Pedron T. Philpott D.J. Gaits F. Sable J. Sheetz M.P. Parsot C. Sansonetti P.J. Payrastre B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5069-5078Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). IpaA specifically binds the N-terminal head domain of vinculin and stimulates local actin depolymerization, which is thought to facilitate the enclosing of the macropinocytotic pockets entrapping Shigella (3Cossart P. Sansonetti P.J. Science. 2004; 304: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 20Bourdet-Sicard R. Rüdiger M. Jockusch B.M. Gounon P. Sansonetti P.J. Tran Van Nhieu G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5853-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Previous study indicated that IpgB1 is secreted from Shigella via the TTSS into the medium (21Buchrieser C. Glaser P. Rusniok C. Nedjari H. d'Hauteville H. Kunst F. Sansonetti P. Parsot C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 760-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Since the ipgB1 gene is located upstream of the ipaBCDA operon on the large plasmid of Shigella, we speculated that IpgB1 would act as the effector protein. In this study, we have attempted to characterize the role of IpgB1 in Shigella infection and found that IpgB1 plays a major role in promoting the bacterial invasion of epithelial cells. The examination of HeLa cells infected with the wild-type, the ipgB1 mutant, or IpgB1-hyperproducing strain suggested that the invasive capacity and the scale of membrane ruffling were comparable with the level of IpgB1 production in bacteria. Since the size and the frequency of membrane ruffles in host cells induced by IpgB1 expression were diminished when Rac1 and Cdc42 activities were inhibited, such as by treatment with GGTI-298 (an inhibitor of the geranylgeranylation of Rho GTPases) or by the knocking down of rac1 or cdc42 by siRNAs, it was likely that IpgB1 is a novel Shigella effector acting as the invasin required for promoting bacterial entry into epithelial cells.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have identified IpgB1 protein as an effector secreted from Shigella via the TTSS, which acts to promote bacterial entry into host cells. We also found that IpgB1 expression in mammalian cells is able to induce membrane ruffling via the stimulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 activities. Our conclusions were based on the following results: (i) the ipgB1 mutant partially but significantly attenuated pulmonary infection in the murine model; (ii) when the MDCK cell monolayer was infected with the ipgB1 mutant, the number of plaques was significantly lower than that with the wild type; (iii) the invasive efficiency or the scale of membrane ruffles in HeLa cells infected with Shigella was comparable with the level of IpgB1 production in bacteria; (iv) ectopic expression of IpgB1 in HeLa cells induced the formation of large membrane ruffles; (v) the IpgB1-mediated formation of membrane ruffles in host cells was inhibited when the rac1 or cdc42 expression was knocked down with siRNA; (vi) the IpgB1-mediated membrane ruffles were diminished in cells treated with GGTI-298 (a Rho GTPase inhibitor); and (vii) ectopic expression of IpgB1 in cells or Shigella infection led to stimulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 activities. These results suggest that IpgB1 is a novel Shigella effector involved in promoting bacterial uptake by epithelial cells.Shigella use trigger mechanisms to enter epithelial cells (3Cossart P. Sansonetti P.J. Science. 2004; 304: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 4Sasakawa C. Lamont R. Bacterial Invasion of Host Cells. 5. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2004: 25-57Google Scholar). This bacterial activity is gained through the interaction of several effectors such as IpaA, IpaB, IpaC, and VirA with their host target molecules (see Introduction). IpgB1 is shown to be rapidly secreted from Shigella via the TTSS. Indeed, under in vitro conditions for stimulating the TTSS such as by adding Congo red to the medium, IpgB1 secretion from Shigella can be detected only 15 min after the addition of Congo red into the medium (this study). When we visualized the IpgB1-Myc protein secreted from Shigella into HeLa cells using immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed that the IpgB1 signal within the cells was localized around the cytoplasmic membrane as well as within the membrane ruffles. Furthermore, when HeLa cells were infected with the IpgB1-hyperproducing Shigella (WT/pTB-IpgB1-Spa15), the invasive efficiency was dramatically increased by ~30-fold compared with the wild-type level (see Fig. 3E). Consistently, the size of membrane ruffles extending from HeLa cells infected with the IpgB1-hyperproducing Shigella was also more than 2 times larger than that with wild type. Thus, the results suggest that a functional IpgB1 is required at an early stage of Shigella infection, where the IpgB1 activity engages in promoting entry into host cells.The diameter of the plaques that had developed 3 days after infection with the ipgB1 mutant was significantly smaller (one-third the diameter of that with wild type) than that developed after infection with wild-type or ipgB1 complement strain (see Fig. 3B), suggesting that IpgB1 function may also be involved in a later step in Shigella infection such as the cell-cell dissemination step. Dissemination of Shigella through a cell monolayer involves at least four distinctive steps: the actin-based movement of intracellular bacteria, formation of membrane protrusions, engulfment of the protrusions by adjacent cells, and lysis of the two cellular membranes that surround the bacterial protrusion (39Page A.L. Ohayon H. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since the ipgB1 mutant showed no defects in bacterial motility, the formation of membrane protrusions, or the ability to disrupt the host plasma membrane, 3K. Ohya, unpublished data. we speculate that IpgB1 also takes part in the uptake of bacteria by adjacent cells or in some undefined function required for bacterial cell-cell spreading.Since HeLa cells ectopically expressing EGFP-IpgB1 formed large membrane ruffles and the EGFP-IpgB1 signal was predominately associated with the membrane ruffles including the cell periphery, we investigated various truncated versions of IpgB1 fused with EGFP for their membrane association. The results showed that although EGFP-IpgB1-(53-208) was still able to induce membrane ruffling, the degree of association was significantly less than that with EGFP-IpgB1 (full-length IpgB1) or EGFP-IpgB1-(29-208), implying that the N-terminal 52 amino acids may be involved in the association (see Fig. 5B). The other truncated IpgB1 versions (i.e. those lacking the N-terminal 104 amino acids (EGFP-IpgB1-(105-208)), the C-terminal 55 amino acids (EGFP-IpgB1-(1-153)), or both terminal portions (EGFP-IpgB1-(53-153)) were yet unable to induce membrane ruffling in HeLa cells. Therefore, the entire IpgB1 sequence, except amino acid residues 1-29 perhaps required as the TTSS translocating signal (40Ghosh P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 771-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), appears to be required to induce membrane ruffling. Since the amino acid sequence of IpgB1 contains neither a predictable transmembrane domain nor significant similarity to other known proteins in the data base, the membrane association of IpgB1 may be achieved through the interaction with some host protein(s).The IpgB1-mediated membrane ruffling was strongly inhibited in HeLa cells treated with GGTI-298, an inhibitor of geranylgeranylation of Rho GTPases (see Fig. 7B), suggesting that the IpgB1-mediated formation of membrane ruffles is dependent on the activity of Rho GTPases such as Rac1 and Cdc42. A similar inhibitory effect of GGTI-298 on Salmonella entry into host cells was reported (41Forsberg M. Blomgran R. Lerm M. Särndahl E. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A. Stendahl O. Zheng L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 620-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 42Tafazoli F. Magnusson K.E. Zheng L. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 872-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Note that there is another mechanism to lead to formation of membrane ruffles in a Rho GTPase-independent manner (43Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). For example, p21-activated kinase 1 directly interacts with filamin FLNa, and the p21-activated kinase 1-FLNa interaction is involved in inducing ruffle formation independently of Rho GTPases (44Vadlamudi R.K. Li F. Adam L. Nguyen D. Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Indeed, some low level of IpgB1-mediated ruffle formation was still detected upon treatment of HeLa cells with GGTI-298 at 5 μm (Fig. 7B), suggesting that a Rho GTPase-independent ruffle formation may also be partly involved in Shigella invasion. Since the formation of large membrane ruffles induced by expression of EGFP-IpgB1 in HeLa cells was greatly diminished by introducing the Rac1 or Cdc42 siRNAs into the cells, the IpgB1-mediated ruffle formation appears to mostly be dependent on the Rac1 and Cdc42 activities. Indeed, when IpgB1 was expressed in NIH3T3 cells or the cells were infected with Shigella, the levels of activated Rac1 and Cdc42 were significantly increased according to the results of the CRIB-binding assay. The levels of activated Rac1 and Cdc42 in NIH3T3 cells were significantly increased after infection with wild-type Shigella for 15 min in comparison with that with ipgB1 mutant or the uninfected control, which also agreed with the previous study (10Burton E.A. Plattner R. Pendergast A.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5471-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the enhancement of the IpgB1-dependent Rac1 activation was greater than that of Cdc42 (see Fig. 8). Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of Rac1 siRNA on IpgB1-induced ruffle formation was more striking than that of the Cdc42 siRNA (see Fig. 6). Although the mechanism underlying the activation of the Rho GTPases by IpgB1 remains to be elucidated, our results suggest that IpgB1 is capable of mediating stimulation of both Rac1 and Cdc42 activities, in which IpgB1 appears to act on Rac1 more efficiently than Cdc42. Salmonella, SptP (possessing GAP activity), and SopE (and SopE2) effectors (possessing GEF activity) secreted via the TTSS are capable of directly stimulating the Rho GTPases via a direct interaction with the bacterial effectors (45Hardt W.D.

Interestingly, although the IpgB1-induced membrane ruffles were apparently similar to those induced by Salmonella SopE (45Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galán J.E.

IpgB1 does not seem to have any capacity to directly interact with the Rho GTPases as examined by the GST pull-down assay. 3K. Ohya, unpublished data. Many GEF proteins possess a Dbl homology domain through which they directly interact with Rho GTPases, such as Rac1 and Cdc42 (48Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), whereas other GEF proteins, such as Dock180, have no Dbl homology domain but are still capable of activating the Rho GTPases. Dock180 possesses GEF activity associated with the cell membrane via the formation of a Dock180-RhoG-Elmo complex (49Katoh H. Negishi M.

A recent study has indicated that Shigella infection of epithelial cells stimulates accumulation of the Abl tyrosine kinases around the site of bacterial entry, which increases phosphorylation of Crk, an adaptor protein, and thus eventually leads to activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 (10Burton E.A. Plattner R. Pendergast A.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5471-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A more recent study has indicated that cortactin, which is phosphorylated by Src tyrosine kinase, interacts with Crk and promotes local actin polymerization involved in Shigella uptake by host cells (13Bougnères L. Girardin S.E. Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Olivo-Marin J.C. Parsons J.T. Sansonetti P.J. Tran Van Nhieu G. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Since expression of IpgB1 in mammalian cells, such as AGS (a gastric epithelial cell line) cells, MDCK cells, Caco-2 cells, COS-7 cells, or NIH3T3 cells, is also capable of inducing membrane ruffles, 3K. Ohya, unpublished data. we assume that IpgB1 may take part in a signal cascade that stimulates Rac1 and Cdc42 activities, thus promoting Shigella entry into epithelial cells.At present, we have no available data to directly evaluate the relative contribution to bacterial invasion by IpgB1 to the other known effectors such as IpaC or VirA. However, it is most likely that synergistic activity with several Shigella effectors is needed to induce profound macropynocytic events around the site of bacterial entry (see Introduction). Indeed, the invasiveness of HeLa cells by the ipgB1 mutant was ~50% of the level of invasiveness of the wild type (100%) as examined by the gentamicin protection assay (see Fig. 3E), implying that the remaining invasive capacity left in the ipgB1 mutant is attributed to the presence of the ipaC and virA gene functions. Nevertheless, we believe that IpgB1 plays a major role in bacterial entry, because the sizes of the membrane ruffles and the bacterial invasiveness were greatly enhanced as the level of IpgB1 expression increased in epithelial cells and in bacteria, respectively. Of importance, the IpgB1-mediated membrane ruffles in HeLa cells were apparently larger than those induced by IpaC and VirA expression (14Tran Van Nhieu G. Caron E. Hall A. Sansonetti P.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3249-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 15Yoshida S. Katayama E. Kuwae A. Mimuro H. Suzuki T. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2923-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Since none of the above host proteins has so far been found to directly interact with IpgB1 as examined by a yeast two-hybrid or GST pull-down assay, 4K. Ohya and Y. Handa, unpublished data. we speculate that IpgB1 may stimulate Rac1 and Cdc42 by interacting with some host protein(s) associated with the host membrane. In any event, identification of the host protein(s) that interacts with IpgB1 will be necessary to understand the precise role of IpgB1 in Shigella invasion of host cells. IntroductionShigella are highly adapted human pathogens and are the cause of bacillary dysentery. The prominent pathogenic feature of Shigella is the ability to invade a variety of cells during infection of the intestinal mucosa, including enterocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. When Shigella reach the colon, they translocate through the epithelial barrier via the M cells that overlie solitary lymphoid nodules. Once they reach the underlying M cells, Shigella invade the resident macrophages, and the infecting bacteria escape from the phagosome into the cytoplasm. Shigella multiply in the macrophage cytoplasm and finally induce cell death (1Zychlinsky A. Prevost M.C. Sansonetti P.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 2Suzuki T. Nakanishi K. Tsutsui H. Iwai H. Akira S. Inohara N. Chamaillard M. Nuñez G. Sasakawa C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14042-14050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Shigella released from the dead macrophages enter the surrounding enterocytes through their basolateral surface by inducing large scale membrane ruffling. As soon as a bacterium is surrounded by a membrane vacuole, it immediately disrupts the vacuole membrane and escapes into the cytoplasm. Shigella multiply in the cytoplasm and move about by inducing actin polymerization at one pole of the bacterium, by which the pathogen moves within the cytoplasm as well as into the adjacent cells (3Cossart P. Sansonetti P.J. Science. 2004; 304: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of bacteria to enter the colonic epithelial cells is essential for colonization within the intestinal epithelium.For bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, Shigella (and Salmonella) use a special mechanism called the “trigger mechanism of entry,” which is characterized by macropinocytic and phagocytic events that allow cells to trap several bacterial particles simultaneously (4Sasakawa C. Lamont R. Bacterial Invasion of Host Cells. 5. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2004: 25-57Google Scholar). When Shigella comes into contact with epithelial cells, the type III secretion system (TTSS) 1The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type III secretion system; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding domain; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; FCS, fetal calf serum; CR, Congo red; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; MOI, multiplicity of infection; GGTI, geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor; FTI, farnesyltransferase inhibitor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; WT, wild type; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; LPS, lipopolysaccharide. is stimulated and delivers the effectors into the host cells and surrounding bacterial space (5Blocker A. Komoriya K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3027-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The secreted effectors are capable of modulating various host functions engaged in remodeling the surface architecture of the host cell and escape from the host innate defense systems (4Sasakawa C.

Science. 2005; 307: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Studies have indicated that several Shigella effectors, including IpaA, IpaB, IpaC, IpgD, and VirA, secreted via the TTSS are involved in stimulating the reorganization of F-actin and microtubule cytoskeletons that trigger the bacterial uptake by host cells. IpaB, for example, is capable of binding to the hyaluronic acid receptor CD44 (7Skoudy A. Mounier J. Aruffo A. Ohayon H. Gounon P. Sansonetti P. Tran Van Nhieu G.

CMSII plants lack rotenone-sensitive complex I activity and are impaired in physiological and phenotypical traits. To check whether these changes directly result from the deletion of nad7, we constructed CMS transgenic plants (termed as CMSnad7) carrying an edited nad7 cDNA fused to the CAMV 35S promoter and to a mitochondrial targeting sequence. The nad7 sequence was transcribed and translated and the NAD7 protein directed to mitochondria in CMSnad7 transgenic plants, which recovered both wild type morphology and growth features. Blue-native/SDS gel electrophoresis and enzymatic assays showed that, whereas fully assembled complex I was absent from CMSII mitochondria, a functional complex was present in CMSnad7 mitochondria. Furthermore, a supercomplex involving complex I and complex III was present in CMSnad7 as in the wild type. Taken together, these data demonstrate that lack of complex I in CMSII was indeed the direct consequence of the absence of nad7. Hence, NAD7 is a key element for complex assembly in plants.

In all organisms investigated so far (mammals, fungi, bacteria), the assembly of these subunits determines a hydrophobic membrane domain and a matrix protruding peripheral arm (7Guénebaut V. Schlitt A. Weiss H. Leonard K. Friedrich T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism of this large complex is not well understood, but the peripheral arm is thought to bear all the FMN and iron-sulfur cluster cofactors (8Hirst J. Caroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Walker J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Bacteria possess in their cytoplasmic membranes a functionally similar complex composed of 14 subunits representing the catalytic core, all of which have homologues in eukaryotic complexes (9Friedrich T.

Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U. Braun H.-P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) it has been shown that, in addition to the 14 subunits of prokaryotic origin, a large number of Arabidopsis complex I subunits have counterparts in mammals (6Heazlewood J.L. Howell K.A. Millar A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In all eukaryotes, complex I is composed of subunits of both nuclear and mitochondrial (“nad” genes) origin. However, the number of mitochondrially encoded complex I subunits varies among kingdoms. At least three nad genes, i.e. nad1, nad4, and nad5, are ubiquitously present in the mitochondrial DNA of eukaryotes with a functional respiratory chain involving complex I (13Adams K.L. Palmer J.D. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 2003; 29: 380-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Plant mitochondrial DNA encodes nine complex I subunits (14Rasmusson A.G. Heiser V. Zabaleta E. Brennicke A. Grohmann L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which all have homologues in bacterial complex I. Of these, NAD7 and NAD9 are probably located in the matrix arm of the complex as are their homologues of the 49- and 30-kDa peptides of fungi or mammals, which are nuclear encoded (15Djafarzadeh R.

Shannon R.J. Walker J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The 49-kDa subunit (whose counterparts are named NuoD in bacteria, NAD7 in plants, NDUFS2 in humans), which belongs to the module connecting the NADH oxidizing moiety located in the peripheral arm to the membrane part, has been suggested to participate in ubiquinone reduction (16Dupuis A. Prieur I. Lunardi J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), although it is possibly not directly involved in the binding of an iron-sulfur cluster (17Chevallet M. Dupuis A. Issartel J.-P.

In humans, defects in components of the respiratory chain (many of which result from complex I alterations) lead to a number of pathologies that mainly affect mitochondria-rich tissues and lead to encephalomyopathies, cardiomyopathies, the Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and other mitochondrial diseases (18Wallace D.C.

Unlike animals, plants and most fungi have rotenone-insensitive enzymes called alternative NAD(P)H-ubiquinone oxidoreductases, which can oxidize NAD(P)H. In contrast to complex I (rotenone-sensitive NDH-1-type enzyme), these NDH-2-type enzymes do not catalyze coupled electron transport.

Therefore, plant and fungi mutants with a deficient complex I are potentially viable. Plants also contain a non-phosphorylating terminal oxidase (alternative oxidase) that has the capacity to transfer electrons from ubiquinol to oxygen, bypassing the proton translocating complexes, III and IV (30Moore A.L.

This mutant, named CMSII, exhibits reduced growth and abnormal morphological traits in leaves and flowers. We have shown that a recombination/amplification process resulted in a 72-kb deletion in the mutant mitochondrial genome (31Li X.Q. Chétrit P. Mathieu C. Vedel F. De Paepe R. Rémy R.

Of the deleted sequences, only the nad7 gene is present as a single copy, whereas others such as nad3 or orf87 are duplicated in the mitochondrial genome. Further characterization of the CMSII complex I showed that, in addition to NAD7, other subunits, e.g. NAD9, NAD1, and the nuclear-encoded 23- and 38-kDa subunits were also missing (36Gutierres S.

As a result, CMSII plants are devoid of rotenone-sensitive respiration (complex I) but exhibit enhanced rotenone-insensitive NADH oxidation (NDH-2-type dehydrogenases), resulting in increased global leaf respiration (38Sabar M.

Here, we examined the structure of complex I in CMSII plants to determine whether the observed defects were correlated only with the loss of nad7. For this purpose, we used a strategy consisting of allotopic expression of nad7, and targeting the gene product to CMSII mitochondria. Plant Material—The fertile wild type (WT) 1The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; AOX, alternative oxidase; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; BN, blue-native; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; Tes, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; TMBZ, tetramethyl-3,3′,5,5′-benzidine; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; RT, reverse transcription; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride. N. sylvestris was provided by the Institut des Tabacs (Bergerac, France). The CMSII mutant was obtained by protoplast culture (31Li X.Q. Chétrit P. Mathieu C. Vedel F. De Paepe R. Rémy R. Ambard-Bretteville F. Curr. Genet. 1988; 13: 261-266Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and maintained by pollination with the wild type. For CMSII transformation, seeds were sterilized in 10% calcium hypochloride and germinated on agar supplemented with standard nutritive medium under a 16-h photoperiod at a day/night temperature of 23/17 °C. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Amplification of the nad7 cDNA—For total RNA isolation, leaf tissue pieces (100 mg) from young leaves were harvested in liquid nitrogen. RNAs were extracted by the TRIzol-chloroform procedure (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed as follows. Reverse transcription (RT) reaction was performed for 1 h at 42 °C in a mix containing 2 μg of total RNAs, 1 μl of random hexamer mix (100 μm; Invitrogen), 6 μlof5× enzyme buffer, 2 μl of dNTP mix (10 mm), 2 μlof dithiothreitol (100 mm), 1 μl of RNAsin (50 units), 2 μl of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (400 units; Invitrogen). Aliquots (3 μl) of the RT reaction were then used in standard PCR amplification (25 μl of final volume) using specific primers designed from the nad7 genomic sequence (33Pla M. Mathieu C. De Paepe R. Chétrit P. Vedel F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The upstream nad7 primer contained the NcoI site (underlined) for fusion of the nad7 cDNA with an upstream targeting sequence to mitochondria: 5′-GTCACCCATGGCGACTAAGAACAGG-3′. Downstream primer (PstI site): 5′-GTACCCTGCAGGTCCTATCTATCCACCTCTCC-3′. The targeting sequence was PCR amplified from a genomic clone of the potato formate dehydrogenase gene (40Ambard-Bretteville F. Small I. Grandjean O. Colas des Francs-Small C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 2003; 311: 966-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using an upstream primer (XbaI site): 5′-GTACCTCTAGAAAAAATGGCGATGAGTCGT-3′, and the downstream primer (NcoI): 5′-GTCACCCATGGAAGCCTGAAGTTCTCT-3′. To ensure a proper cleavage of the presequence, the downstream formate dehydrogenase primer carried 12 bp coding for the four amino acids located downstream the processing site. The construct was cloned under control of the 35S CAMV promoter in the pCW162 vector. cDNA Cloning, Antibody Production—The RT-PCR (nad7 cDNA) and PCR products (targeting sequence) were digested with NcoI + PstI and NcoI + XbaI, respectively, purified on agarose gel, and ligated under standard conditions prior to insertion in the pCW162 vector (M. P. Doutrillaux., personal gift) derived from the binary pPZP111 vector (41Hajdukiewicz P. Svab Z. Maliga P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). NM522 Escherichia coli cells were transformed and plated on agar medium containing chloramphenicol. Transformants were probed using the labeled nad7 exon 3 from N. sylvestris (33Pla M. Mathieu C. De Paepe R. Chétrit P. Vedel F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Several positive clones were sequenced to check both the formate dehydrogenase presequence/nad7 junction and the editing of the cDNA. The LBA 4404 strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens was then transformed using a fully edited construct (42Bevan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8711-8872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar). For antibody production, the nad7 cDNA was cloned in the expression vector pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences). The GST-NAD7 fusion protein was purified from E. coli cells using Sepharose glutathione columns and SDS-PAGE. Antibody production was performed by Agro-Bio. Plant Transformation—CMSII leaf explants from 6–8-week-old plantlets grown under sterile conditions were transformed with A. tumefaciens carrying the formate dehydrogenase-nad7 construct, using a procedure derived from that of Horsch et al. (43Horsch R.B. Fry J.E. Hoffman N.L. Eicholtz D. Rogers S.D. Fraley R.T. Science. 1985; 227: 1229-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (3789) Google Scholar). Day 1: A. tumefaciens cells were grown for 2 days at 28 °C in 2YT medium plus chloramphenicol (12.5 mg/l). CMSII leaf discs were placed on MS30 medium plus 6-benzylaminopurine (1 mg/l). Day 4: Plant discs were incubated for 50 s in cultured cells, briefly dried on sterile filter paper, and returned to former plates. Day 6: Discs were transferred to new plates containing MS30 medium plus 6-benzylaminopurine (1 mg/l), cefotaxime (200 mg/l), and kanamycin (100 mg/l). The first shoots appeared on calli after 4 weeks and were transferred for rooting on MS30 medium plus cefotaxime (200 mg/l) and kanamycin (100 mg/l). Regenerated plantlets were grown in a greenhouse under a 16-h photoperiod at a day/night temperature of 23/17 °C and 60% relative humidity for further analyses. DNA and RNA Gel Blot Analyses—Southern and Northern blot analyses were performed following standard protocols as described in Ref. 38Sabar M. De Paepe R. Kouchkovsky Y. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar. Isolation of Mitochondria—Lamina of leaves (200 g) were briefly homogenized in a Waring blender in 1000 ml of medium consisting of 0.5 m mannitol, 0.04 m MOPS-KOH, 0.002 m EGTA, 0.6% insoluble polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.004 m cysteine, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (slightly modified from Sabar et al., Ref. 38Sabar M. De Paepe R. Kouchkovsky Y. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A crude mitochondrial fraction was prepared by successive differential centrifugations of the crude homogenized leaf extract. Mitochondria were further purified by sedimentation in self-generated Percoll gradient using 32% Percoll medium as in Ref. 38Sabar M. De Paepe R. Kouchkovsky Y. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar. In the course of this study, an alternative step consisted of the use of two Percoll layers (28 and 48%) in 0.5 m mannitol, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Mitochondria were collected either in the lower part of the tube or at the interface between the two layers. They were washed extensively and stored at –80 °C if not used immediately. Electrophoretic Techniques—For blue-native electrophoresis (BN-PAGE), 4–13% gradient acrylamide gels (1.5 mm thick) were cast according to Schägger et al. (44Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar) except that gel buffer consisted of 0.025 m BisTris, 0.25 m aminocaproic acid, pH 7 and the cathodic buffer contained 0.012% Coomassie blue G250. Typically, the mitochondrial pellet (∼1 mg of proteins) was resuspended in 1.5 ml of 0.01 m Tes-NaOH, pH 7, 0.5 mm Pefabloc sc (Fluka, Switzerland) and disrupted by several brief bursts of ultrasounds. Mitochondrial membranes were then sedimented at 18,000 × g for 20 min and further resuspended in 100 μl of 0.05 m BisTris, 0.75 m aminocaproic acid, 1 mm Na2EDTA. To this suspension 15 μl of 10% dodecylmaltoside or 30 μl of 10% digitonin were added. After incubation on ice for 15–30 min and clarification by centrifugation (16000 × g, 8 min), samples were supplemented with 5% Coomassie blue G250 (dissolved in 0.75 m aminocaproic acid) to a final ratio detergent/blue of 4. Samples were then loaded onto a BN gel and run either for 5 h at 5 mA with a 300-volt limit or overnight with a 180-volt limit. After electrophoresis, gel strips were excised and either stored at –20 °C in a small volume of 0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol or applied to a second dimension. For this procedure, gel strips were transferred in a new medium consisting of 0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS and heated at 60 °C for 10 min. After addition of dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 50 mm for a further 10 min, the strips were introduced on top of a 4% polyacrylamide concentration gel cast over a 9–18% polyacrylamide gradient gel (1.55 mm thick) as previously reported (45Pineau B. Gérard-Hirne C. Selve C. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 39: 73-85Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After BN-PAGE, the gel was washed for 30 min in 0.1 m MOPS, pH 7.8. The NADH dehydrogenase activity of complex I was revealed in-gel by incubation in the presence of 1 mm nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.2 mm NADH in 0.05 m MOPS, pH 7.8. Alternately, after BN-PAGE, the gel was washed in water and transferred on a PVDF membrane in 0.025 m Tricine, 0.0075 m imidazole by a semidry blotting procedure. The PVDF membrane was then processed for incubation first with anti-NAD7 antibodies and then with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (TMBZ (tetramethyl-3,3′,5,5′-benzidine) substrate). After SDS-PAGE, the gels were either stained with Coomassie blue in methanol, acetic acid, or stained with Ag nitrate, or transferred on a PVDF membrane in 0.02 m Tris, 0.15 m glycine, 10% methanol and processed for incubating with anti-NAD7 or anti-AOX antibodies incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (TMBZ substrate). Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Peptides—Spots collected from BN/SDS-PAGE were analyzed by peptide mass fingerprint of tryptic peptides in a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Voyager D E super STR; Applied Biosystems). Enzymatic Assays—NADH or deamino-NADH-cytochrome c reductases were measured at 550 nm in an assay medium consisting of 0.3 m sucrose, 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.002% bovine serum albumin (26Michaleka A.M. Agius S.C. Moller I.M. Rasmusson A.G. Plant J. 2004; 37: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and 0.1 mm KCN. The assay was supplemented with mitochondrial suspension membranes (10–40 μg), horse heart cytochrome c (50 μm), NADH or deamino-NADH (200 μm), and, when used, rotenone (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, 40 μm) and antimycin A (0.4 mg ml–1). The molar absorption coefficient of cytochrome c was 19.1 mm–1 cm–1. NADH or deamino-NADH dehydrogenase activities were measured in the same medium (except the lack of KCN) supplemented with 40 μm decylubiquinone, 200 μm NADH or deamino-NADH, and 40–80 μg of mitochondrial suspension membranes. Kinetics were followed at 340 nm, and the evolution of the 400 nm absorption was periodically checked to take into account nonspecific variations of the absorption. The molar absorption coefficient of NADH was 6.22 mm–1 cm–1. Transformation of CMSII with an Edited nad7 cDNA, Plant Regeneration, and Expression of the Transgene in CMSnad7— Sequencing of the genomic region spanning nad7 in N. sylvestris showed that this gene consisted of four exons interrupted by three cis-spliced introns, resulting in a complex transcription pattern (33Pla M. Mathieu C. De Paepe R. Chétrit P. Vedel F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the 1185-bp nad7 cDNA and comparison with the genomic sequence revealed the presence of 28 editing sites (Fig. 1). Fourteen codon changes resulted in leucine residues, of which eleven consisted of serine to leucine transitions. Differences between the protein sequence (Fig. 1, coordinates 38, 53, 213, 218, 228, 360) derived from nuclear and mitochondrial nad7 genes in several species (46Kobayashi Y. Knoop V. Fukuzawa H. Brennicke A. Ohyama K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 589-592PubMed Google Scholar) and in N. sylvestris showed that, following edition, the N. sylvestris nad7 mRNA sequence matched better to the liverwort, bovine, or Neurospora nuclear-encoded nad7 gene than with the N. sylvestris genomic sequence. This was in agreement with the hypothesis of Kobayashi et al. (46Kobayashi Y. Knoop V. Fukuzawa H. Brennicke A. Ohyama K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 589-592PubMed Google Scholar) that the nuclear nad7 genes in these species originated from mitochondria-encoded and -edited mRNA molecules. A number of regenerating plantlets from transformed explants grown on kanamycin plates were transferred in a greenhouse. All plants exhibited a restored phenotype (Fig. 2) at flowering time as regards plant height, leaf and flower shape, and set seeds. They were fertile, although the 35S promoter is not expressed in pollen, suggesting that enough stable complex I assembled in mother pollen cells can function and allow fertile pollen production in mature anthers. In the kanamycin-resistant plants, PCR experiments (Fig. 3A) showed the presence of the full-length cDNA using total DNAs as template (three are shown in Fig. 3, A–C). This was observed without segregation in the progeny of the primary transformants over five generations. To analyze their mitochondrial genome, we used a probe consisting of a cloned 5.25-kb SacI fragment present in the WT mitochondrial DNA but absent in CMSII (32Chétrit P. Rios R. De Paepe R. Vitart V. Gutierres S. Vedel F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The probe was hybridized on Southern blots carrying control and transformed plant total DNAs restricted with SacI. Fig. 3B shows that regenerants A, B, and C shared a SacI recombinant fragment of 11.8 kb specific to the CMSII mtDNA and, therefore, are of the mutant type. To check for the presence of nad7 transcripts in the transgenic plants, blots carrying total RNAs were hybridized using the nad7 cDNA as a probe. As shown in Fig. 3C, all recombinant plants exhibited a 1.6-kb transcript corresponding to the transcription of the nad7 cDNA, whereas in the WT the transcription pattern of the cis-spliced nad7 mitochondrial gene typically consisted of three transcripts 1.5, 1.7, and 2.3 kb in size (33Pla M. Mathieu C. De Paepe R. Chétrit P. Vedel F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine whether the NAD7 polypeptide was produced from the nad7 cDNA sequence and was addressed to mitochondria, protein extracts from WT, CMSII, and CMSnad7 leaf mitochondria were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-NAD7 antibodies. As observed in Fig. 4A, no signal could be seen in the CMSII extract, whereas a cross-reacting product in the range of 43 kDa was present in both WT and CMSnad7 extracts, indicating that a mature NAD7 polypeptide indeed accumulated in mitochondria of the transgenic line. Very comparable signals were obtained in the WT and in the transgenic line using total extracts from similar leaf surfaces (Fig. 4B). Thus, although the constitutive 35S promoter was used for nad7 expression, the NAD7 subunit did not over-accumulate in CMSnad7, suggesting the existence of a posttranslational regulatory process. Assembly of Complex I in Transgenic CMSII Plants—To compare the composition of complex I in the WT, CMSII, and CMSnad7 lines, mitochondrial protein complexes were analyzed by BN-PAGE. The larger complexes, obtained after solubilization with dodecylmaltoside or digitonin, were separated on BN gels and their polypeptide composition further analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The polypeptide patterns obtained from dissociated complexes I, III, V, and from the two different migrating forms of complex IV were in good agreement with the results of Kruft et al. (47Kruft V. Eubel H. Jänsch L. Werhahn W. Braun H.-P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1694-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and Eubel et al. (48Eubel H. Jänsch L. Braun H.-P. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Complex I was identified in dodecylmaltoside-solubilized mitochondrial membranes as a blue band migrating in the 1,000-kDa range (Fig. 5A). This band was stained in violet color in the presence of NADH substrate and nitro blue tetrazolium because of its dehydrogenase activity (Fig. 5B) and cross-reacted with antibodies raised against NAD7 (Fig. 5C). Complex I gave a complex polypeptide pattern with 23 spots (Fig. 6A), of which one ∼43 kDa spot was recognized by the anti-NAD7 antibodies (Fig. 5D). The main complex I band was often accompanied by a discrete faster migrating band detected with the anti-serum (Fig. 5C) and by histochemical staining (Fig. 5B). This satellite band contained a number of polypeptides having the same molecular mass as some complex I polypeptides.Fig. 6Polypeptide composition of the mitochondrial membrane complexes from the WT, CMSII, and CMSnad"

Unlike other transglutaminases, it is involved in cell-matrix interactions and serves as an adhesion co-receptor for fibronectin. Previous work established that the fibronectin-binding motif(s) is located within the NH2-terminal proteolytic fragment of the protein consisting of residues 1–272. Here we identify a novel fibronectin recognition site within this sequence of tissue transglutaminase. Substitution of individual domains of tissue transglutaminase with those from homologous factor XIIIA showed that the major fibronectin-binding site is present within the first β-sandwich domain of the protein. Experiments with deletion mutants of the first domain revealed that amino acids 81–140 of tissue transglutaminase are involved in fibronectin binding. Using synthetic peptides encompassing this region, we found that the peptide 88WTATVVDQQDCTLSLQLTT106 inhibited the interaction of tissue transglutaminase with fibronectin and decreased transglutaminase-dependent cell adhesion and spreading. In the three-dimensional structure of the first domain, amino acids 88–106 comprise an extended hairpin formed by antiparallel β strands 5 and 6. Mutations of Asp94 and Asp97 within the β5/β6 hairpin to Ala significantly reduced the affinity of tissue transglutaminase for fibronectin, indicating that these residues are critical for fibronectin binding.

The corepressor Evi-1 exerts its oncogenic effects by repressing TGF-β/Smad3-mediated transcription, thereby blocking TGF-β-induced growth arrest. Because Evi-1 interacts with the highly conserved MH2 domain of Smad3, we investigated the physical and functional interaction of Evi-1 with Smad1 and Smad2, downstream targets of BMP and activin signaling, respectively. Evi-1 interacted with and repressed the receptor-activated transcription through Smad1 and Smad2, similarly to Smad3. In addition, Evi-1 repressed BMP/Smad1- and activin/Smad2-mediated induction of endogenous Xenopus gene expression, suggesting a role of repression of BMP and activin signals by Evi-1 in vertebrate embryogenesis. Evi-1 also repressed the induction of endogenous Smad7 expression by TGF-β family ligands. In the course of these studies, we observed Evi-1 repression of Smad transactivation even when Smad binding to DNA was kept constant. We therefore explored the mechanism of Evi-1 repression of TGF-β family-inducible transcription. Evi-1 repression did not result from displacement of Smad binding to DNA or to CREB-binding protein but from the recruitment of Evi-1 by Smad3 and CREB-binding protein to DNA. Following TGF-β stimulation, Evi-1 and the associated corepressor CtBP were recruited to the endogenous Smad7 promoter. Evi-1 recruitment to the promoter decreased TGF-β-induced histone acetylation, coincident with its repression of Smad7 gene expression. In this way, Evi-1 acts as a general Smad corepressor to inhibit TGF-β-, activin-, and BMP-inducible transcription.

The actions of the TGF-β family ligands are particularly important during embryogenesis and tumorigenesis (1Chang H. Brown C.W. Matzuk M.M. Endocr.

Rev. 2002; 23: 787-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). TGF-β acts as a tumor suppressor by inducing the expression of the p15Ink4B or p21Cip1 Cdk inhibitor genes to arrest proliferation of many cell types (2Siegel P.M. Massagué J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar, 3Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar, 4Wakefield L.M.

TGF-β family ligands signal through Smads, which regulate transcription by cooperating with DNA sequence-specific transcription factors (8Derynck R. Zhang Y.E.

Among the Smads, Smad1, -5, and -8 relay signals from BMP-activated receptors, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 are the primary effectors of activin and TGF-β signaling, respectively. Upon ligand binding, the receptor complex phosphorylates and activates these Smads, resulting in dissociation of Smads from the receptor, heteromerization with Smad4, and nuclear translocation of the Smad complex. With the exception of Smad2, Smads bind DNA through their N-terminal MH1 domains. Stable interaction with select promoter sequences, however, occurs by association of the Smad complex with sequence-specific transcription factors. For example, in response to TGF-β, Smad2 and Smad3 interact with Sp1 at the p15Ink4B or p21Cip1 promoters (11Feng X.H. Lin X. Derynck R.

The receptor-activated Smads also bind directly, through their C-terminal MH2 domains, to the coactivators CBP/p300. This coactivator recruitment, together with the physical and functional interactions with sequence-specific transcription factors, confers ligand-induced transcriptional activation (8Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar, 9ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 10Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Smads can recruit additional coactivators, such as SMIF, MSG1, or Swift, that enhance the transcription response or corepressors, including c-Ski, TGIF, SIP1, SNIP1, or Tob, which decrease or inhibit ligand-induced transactivation (13Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another Smad3 corepressor is the nuclear proto-oncogene, evi-1, which inhibits cellular responsiveness to TGF-β-induced growth arrest (14Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The Evi-1 protein is a 145-kDa, 10-zinc finger-containing polypeptide that can function as a DNA sequence-dependent transcription repressor (15Hirai H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1367-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Targeted inactivation of the evi-1 gene results in embryonic lethality because of defective heart, brain, and paraxial mesenchyme development and widespread hypocellularity (16Hoyt P.R. Bartholomew C. Davis A.J. Yutzey K. Gamer L.W. Potter S.S. Ihle J.N. Mucenski M.L. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This phenotype is consistent with the expression of Evi-1 during embryogenesis and the role of Evi-1 as a potent activator of cellular proliferation (17Perkins A.S. Mercer J.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Development. 1991; 111: 479-487PubMed Google Scholar). In adult tissues, Evi-1 is expressed at very low levels with the exception of the promy-elocytic stage of myeloid differentiation, where it activates myeloid cell proliferation while inhibiting differentiation (18Morishita K. Parganas E. Matsugi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The expression pattern and proliferative function of Evi-1 explains the occurrence of myeloid leukemias in humans with chromosomal rearrangement at the evi-1 locus. Most of these rearrangements cause Evi-1 overexpression and uncontrolled myeloid cell proliferation (15Hirai H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1367-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A recent study using microarray analysis of gene expression in AML patients revealed that overexpression of Evi-1 correlated with poor treatment outcomes, illustrating the importance of tightly regulated Evi-1 expression and function (19Valk P.J. Verhaak R.G. Beijen M.A. Erpelinck C.A. Barjesteh van Waalwijk van Doorn-Khosrovani S. Boer J.M. Beverloo H.B. Moor-house M.J. van der Spek P.J. Lowenberg B. Delwel R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 1617-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Evi-1-mediated transformation and transcriptional repression require interaction with the corepressor CtBP (20Izutsu K. Kurokawa M. Imai Y. Maki K. Mitani K. Hirai H. Blood. 2001; 97: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 21Palmer S. Brouillet J.P. Kilbey A. Fulton R. Walker M. Crossley M. Bartholomew C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25834-25840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which itself interacts with histone deacetylases (HDACs) (22Chinnadurai G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In addition to interacting with transcriptional corepressors, Evi-1 can also interact with the co-activators CBP and p300/CBP-associated factor, which have intrinsic histone acetylase activity (23Chakraborty S. Senyuk V. Sitailo S. Chi Y. Nucifora G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44936-44943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Coexpression of CBP reverses the transcription repression by Evi-1 at an artificial promoter that allows for Evi-1 binding (23Chakraborty S. Senyuk V. Sitailo S. Chi Y. Nucifora G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44936-44943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); however, the physiological importance of this interaction at a natural promoter that is regulated by Evi-1 has yet to be determined. Evi-1 has been shown to suppress TGF-β-induced signaling through direct interaction with Smad3. Thus, Evi-1 inhibits TGF-β-mediated Smad3 induction of a p15Ink4B Cdk inhibitor reporter gene (14Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This inhibition is thought to prevent the normal growth-inhibitory response to TGF-β and to enhance proliferation. Full repression of Smad3 activity requires interaction of Evi-1 with CtBP (20Izutsu K. Kurokawa M. Imai Y. Maki K. Mitani K. Hirai H. Blood. 2001; 97: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Evi-1 was proposed to act as a Smad3-specific corepressor that decreases Smad3 DNA binding (14Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The requirement of the Smad3 MH2 domain for Evi-1 repression of TGF-β inducible transcription led us to investigate the physical interaction of Evi-1 with Smads 1-4, which have MH2 domains that are highly homologous to Smad3. Since the MH2 domain of Smad3 also interacts with CBP/p300 (13Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was conceivable that Evi-1 binding to the MH2 domain might interfere with coactivator recruitment, thus providing a mechanism for repression of Smad3-mediated transcription. We therefore examined the ability of Evi-1 to bind and repress the function of TGF-β-, BMP-, and activin-receptor activated Smads. We observed that Evi-1 interacted with each Smad tested. Evi-1 repressed BMP/Smad1-, activin/Smad2- and TGF-β/Smad3-induced transcription of reporter genes as well as endogenous Smad7 gene expression. Evi-1 also repressed BMP/Smad1- and activin/Smad2-mediated induction of endogenous Xenopus genes required for cell fate specification, suggesting a role for Evi-1 in development. Evi-1 did not interfere with CBP binding to Smad3; nor did it displace Smad3 from DNA. Rather, TGF-β stimulated recruitment of Evi-1 and CtBP to the endogenous Smad7 promoter, resulting in decreased TGF-β-induced histone acetylation and transcription. Coding sequences for C-terminally Myc tag- or VP16-fused Evi-1 proteins or defined regions were generated by oligonucleotide- or PCR-based techniques from pME-Evi-1 and pME-Evi-1ΔZF1-7 (14Kurokawa M.

Plasmid p800-Luc containing the luciferase reporter gene under control of the PAI-1 promoter (33Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

The Xvent2-Luc reporter plasmid contains ~250 bp of the Xvent2 promoter that is specifically responsive to BMP signaling (35Candia A.F. Watabe T. Hawley S.H. Onichtchouk D. Zhang Y. Derynck R. Niehrs C. Cho K.W. Development. 1997; 124: 4467-4480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was provided by C. Niehrs. The -226gsc-Luc reporter plasmid, in which luciferase is expressed from an activin/BVg1-specific response element of the goosecoid promoter (36Watabe T. Kim S. Candia A. Rothbacher U. Hashimoto C. Inoue K. Cho K.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3038-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), was provided by K. W. Cho. The pFR-Luc reporter plasmid has five copies of a Gal4-binding element, followed by the luciferase gene (Stratagene). Smad7Pro-Luc containing 0.5 kb of Smad7 promoter sequence was previously described (37Nagarajan R.P. Zhang J. Li W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33412-33418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Plasmid pSV-β-galactosidase was acquired from Promega. COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, whereas HepG2 and MDA-MB-468 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, supplemented with nonessential amino acids. Mouse embryonic Smad3-/- fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. C2C12 myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20% fetal bovine serum. HEC-1b cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's balanced salt solution supplemented with sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, and 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-1 and Smad3-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). HepG2, MDA-MB-468, and C2C12 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). To generate C2C12 cells stably expressing Evi-1 or siCtBP, retroviral vectors were used as described (25Choy L. Skillington J. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 667-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Evi-1 and CtBP expression levels were verified using Western blotting. FLAG- or Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from transfected cell lysates as described (38Feng X.H. Filvaroff E.H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24237-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking of interacting proteins using dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) was performed as described (39Shum L. Reeves S.A. Kuo A.C. Fromer E.S. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 903-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), followed by harvest of lysates in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100. Anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma-Aldrich) or anti-Myc (9E10; Covance Research Products) antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate tagged proteins. For subsequent Western blotting, the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and detected with the appropriate primary antibody. Antibodies used for Western blotting include anti-Evi-1 (63Matsugi T. Morishita K. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1259-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), provided by J. Ihle, anti-Smad3 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-CtBP (H-440; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FLAG (M2), anti-Myc (9E10), and anti-HA (HA-11; Covance Research Products). Antibody-bound proteins were visualized with chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Transfections, TGF-β treatment, and reporter assays were done as described (38Feng X.H. Filvaroff E.H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24237-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding vector DNA when necessary. Transfected cells were treated for 24 h with or without 400 pm TGF-β, and luciferase activities were measured 48 h after transfection. All assays were performed at least three times. Values are shown as luciferase activity relative to the minimal promoter. Specifically, in Gal4 transactivation assays, the plasmids encoding Gal-Smads were used to keep DNA binding constant to allow evaluation of Smad transactivation function in the presence of other coexpressed proteins. Changes in Smad transactivation were quantified by measuring luciferase expression from the heterologous Gal4 promoter in the cotransfected FR-Luc reporter plasmid. Mammalian two-hybrid assays were utilized to assess physical interactions among proteins. Plasmids encoding Gal-Smads or plasmids for Evi-1 or Smads fused to the VP16 activation domain and the luciferase reporter plasmid pFR-Luc were transfected into HepG2, MDA-MB-468, or Smad3-/- cells, which were then treated with or without TGF-β. Plasmids pGEX-Smad1-4 have been described (29Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 40Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of GST or GST-Smad fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated, as previously described, with 35S-labeled, in vitro translated proteins (TNT translation kit; Promega) with similar specific radioactivity (29Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Associated 35S-labeled proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Biotinylated 5′ oligonucleotides containing two repeats of the consensus Smad binding element (GTCTAGAC) from the Smad7 promoter were synthesized and annealed with unbiotinylated complementary oligonucleotides to generate probes for DNA precipitation assays: SBE, 5′-ACTTGTCTAGACGTCTAGACTTGG-3′. Immobilization of biotinylated oligonucleotide probes and absorption of nuclear extracts from transfected COS cells were carried out using streptavidin-coated Magna-sphere paramagnetic particles (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions and as described (11Feng X.H. Lin X. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5178-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). After extensive washing, DNA-bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using antibodies that recognized FLAG (M2)-, Myc (9E10)-, or HA (HA-11)-tagged proteins. In parallel, the cell lysates were immunoblotted to demonstrate the expression of transfected proteins. RNA was isolated using RNAeasy reagents (Qiagen). cDNA was generated from equal amounts of RNA using NEB protoscript reagents with the dtVN23 primer. Real time PCR analysis was performed to assess Smad7 expression. Expression was normalized to ribosomal protein L19. Primers for mouse Smad7 correspond to 5′-CAGAAAGTGCGGAGCAAGATC-3′ and 5′-AAACCCACACGCCATCCA-3′ and Taqman 5′-CGGCATCCAGCTGACGCGG-3′. Primers for mouse ribosomal protein L19 correspond to 5′-GCTGGATGACAACCTGCTGTACT-3′ and 5′-TGTGGGACCGGCTTCATG-3′ and Taqman 5′-CGCCCTTCCCGAGTACAGCACCTT-3′. LPCX and LPCX-Evi-1 C2C12 cells were treated with or without TGF-β (1 ng/ml) in 0.2% serum for 60 min to assess Evi-1 and CtBP binding and 120 min to assess acetylated histone 4. Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Following a 5-min 125 mm glycine quench and two PBS washes, cells were lysed for 10 min in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), harvested and spun 500 × g for 1 min. Nuclei were washed for 10 min in wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 200 mm NaCl), collected, and resuspended in radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Soluble chromatin was prepared by sonication and immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc (9E10), anti-acetyl histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), or anti-CtBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies for 16 h. Immune complexes were collected using Protein A-agarose beads that had been preincubated with 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA and IgG. Sequential 10-min washes were performed in radioimmune precipitation buffer, radioimmune precipitation buffer with 500 mm NaCl, buffer III (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA), and TE buffer. Reactions were incubated at 55 °C for 3 h with proteinase K and then at 65 °C for 6 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. DNA fragments were purified by phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. PCR was performed using 5 μl of the 50-μl DNA solution using real-time quantitative PCR with primers corresponding to mouse Smad7 promoter sequence: 5′-AGCTTTTAGAAACCCGATCTGTTG-3′, 5′-CGTCACGTGGCCGTCTAGA-3′, and Taqman 5′-TGCGAAACACAATCGCTTTTTT-3′. Each reaction was normalized using primers directed against ribosomal protein L19 sequence. RNAs used for microinjection into Xenopus embryos were synthesized with SP6 RNA polymerase using mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). The following DNA templates were used: KpnI-linearized pRK5-Evi-1, AscI-linearized pCS2++Smad1 and pCS2++Smad2, EcoRI-linearized pSP64T-activin, and XbaI-linearized pSP64T-BMP2. RNAs encoding the above genes were injected alone or in combination into the animal poles of two-cell stage embryos. The doses of RNAs used are Evi-1 (1-2 ng), Smad1 (4 ng), Smad2 (0.5 ng), activin (2 pg), and BMP2 (0.5 ng). Ectodermal explants (animal caps) from injected embryos were obtained at blastula stages (stage 8-9) and incubated to gastrula stages (stage 10-11), at which time total RNA was extracted from these caps, and the gene expression pattern was analyzed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The primers used in the RT-PCR were as described (41Chang C. Wilson P.A. Mathews L.S. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development. 1997; 124: 827-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the addition of the Msx1 primers Msx1-U 5′-GCTAAAAATGGCTGCTAA-3′ and Msx1-D 5′-AGGTGGGCTGTGTAAAGT-3′ and the Mix1 primers Mix1-U 5′-AATGTCTCAAGGCAGAGG-3′ and Mix1-D 5′-GTGTCACTGACACCAGAA-3′. Evi-1 has been shown to repress TGF-β-induced growth inhibition and transcription reporter activity from the p15Ink4B or 3TP promoters (14Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). At these promoters, TGF-β-activated Smad3/4 cooperates with sequence-specific transcription factors (i.e. Sp1 or c-Jun/c-Fos, respectively) (11Feng X.H. Lin X. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5178-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 42Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, we tested whether Evi-1 was able to repress TGF-β- and Smad3/4-mediated transcription independently of its interacting, sequence-specific transcription factors. Tandem Smad binding elements in the (SBE)4 promoter allow cooperative binding of the Smads and TGF-β-inducible transcription without the help of other sequence-specific transcription factors (34Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Similarly to the previously tested promoters, Evi-1 repressed TGF-β- and Smad3/4-induced transcription from the (SBE)4 promoter (Fig. 1A). This result suggests that Evi-1 directly targets the intrinsic transactivation function of Smad3 in the absence of coactivation of an interacting, sequence-specific transcription factor. The zinc finger 1 (ZF1) domain of Evi-1 is required for Smad3 interaction, and the re"

In an HslVU complex, the central pores of HslU hexamer and HslV dodecamer are aligned and the proteolytic active sites are sequestered in the inner chamber of HslV. Thus, the degradation of natively folded proteins requires unfolding and translocation processes for their access into the proteolytic chamber of HslV. A highly conserved GYVG93 sequence constitutes the central pore of HslU ATPase. To determine the role of the pore motif on protein unfolding and translocation, we generated various mutations in the motif and examined their effects on the ability of HslU in supporting the proteolytic activity of HslV against three different substrates: SulA as a natively folded protein, casein as an unfolded polypeptide, and a small peptide. Flexibility provided by Gly residues and aromatic ring structures of the 91st amino acid were essential for degradation of SulA. The same structural features of the GYVG motif were highly preferred, although not essential, for degradation of casein. In contrast, none of the features were required for peptide hydrolysis. Mutations in the GYVG motif of HslU also showed marked influence on its ATPase activity, affinity to ADP, and interaction with HslV. These results suggest that the GYVG motif of HslU plays important roles in unfolding of natively folded proteins as well as in translocation of unfolded proteins for degradation by HslV. These results also implicate a role of the pore motif in ATP cleavage and in the assembly of HslVU complex. HslVU is an ATP-dependent protease consisting of HslU ATPase and HslV peptidase.

A number of ATP-dependent proteases have been identified and studied structurally and mechanically, including the 26 S proteasome in eukaryote and Lon, FtsH, ClpAP, ClpXP, and HslVU in prokaryote (1Goldberg A.L.

These proteases play essential roles in controlling the levels of key regulatory proteins and in the elimination of abnormal polypeptides (3Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Of these, HslVU consisting of HslV peptidase and HslU ATPase resembles the 26 S proteasome in their sequence and overall architecture (6Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Shin D.H. Rohrwild M. Kang M.S. Tanaka K.

HslV consists of two doughnut-shaped hexameric rings, within which the proteolytic active sites are sequestered with access to this chamber restricted to small axial pores (9Bochtler M. Ditzel L.

HslU stimulates the proteolytic activity of HslV one to two orders of magnitude, regardless of whether the substrate is a short peptide or protein that must be unfolded (14Seol J.H. Yoo S.J.

As HslU markedly stimulates the proteolytic activity of HslV, in turn HslV increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis by HslU severalfold (6Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Shin D.H. Rohrwild M. Kang M.S. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14035-14040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the absence of HslV, HslU also serves as a molecular chaperone in preventing the aggregation of SulA, a cell division inhibitor protein that has an intrinsic tendency of aggregation in vivo as well as in vitro (15Seong I.S. Oh J.Y. Lee J.W. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). HslU forms a hexameric ring that constitutes a small central pore (Fig. 1A). The central translocation pore of HslU consists of a primary and a secondary motif (16Wang J. Song J.J. Franklin M.C. Kamtekar S. Im Y.J. Rho S.H. Seong I.S. Lee C.S. Chung C.H. Eom S.H. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 177-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The primary motif contains a conserved GYVG sequence that is located next to Walker box A, and the secondary motif is located in the sequence next to Walker box B (Figs. 1C and 2A). In an HslVU complex, the central pores of HslU and HslV are aligned next to each other but their diameters are so small that only a single polypeptide can be threaded through. Therefore, protein substrates with native structure must be unfolded to an extended conformation and translocated into the inner chamber of HslV for proteolysis.Fig. 2Mutagenesis of the GYVG motif in HslU and purification of the mutant proteins.A, the primary sequence of HslU was shown as a schematic diagram. The GYVG sequence in P1 motif was subjected to mutagenesis as indicated. The boxed A and B indicate Walker boxes A and B, respectively. The open boxed P1 and P2 show the pore motif-1 and -2, respectively. The oval I indicates the intermediate domain.

Biol. 2003; 330: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Depending on the type and content of bound adenine nucleotides, HslU conformation interconverts between “open” and “closed” states according to the pore geometry. This interconversion coincides with an up-down movement of the central pore region of HslU relative to the aligned pore of the bound HslV (17Wang J. Song J.J. Seong I.S. Franklin M.C. Kamtekar S. Eom S.H. Chung C.H. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In particular, Tyr91 in the GYVG pore motif shows a marked movement from inside HslU toward HslV upon the conversion of HslU conformation from the open to closed state (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we have previously proposed that the inter-conversion of HslU conformation driven by ATP hydrolysis may provide a direct force for unfolding and translocation of protein substrates. In an attempt to determine the role of the GYVG pore motif of HslU in protein unfolding and translocation, we generated a number of mutations in the motif sequence and examined their effects on the ability of HslU in supporting the HslV-mediated degradation of three different types of the substrates: SulA as a natively folded protein that requires both unfolding and translocation, casein as an unfolded protein requiring only translocation, and N-carbobenzyloxy-Gly-Gly-Leu-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Z 1The abbreviations used are: Z, N-carbobenzyloxy; AMC, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; DTT, dithiothreitol; MBP, maltose-binding protein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). 1The abbreviations used are: Z, N-carbobenzyloxy; AMC, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; DTT, dithiothreitol; MBP, maltose-binding protein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC) as a peptide substrate that requires neither unfolding nor translocation. We also examined the effects of the mutations on ATP hydrolysis by HslU in the absence and presence of HslV and on the formation of HslVU complex. Materials—All reagents for PCR, including Taq polymerase and restriction endonucleases, were purchased from Takara. Peptide substrates were obtained from Bachem Feinchmikalien AG. Reagents required for ATPase assay were purchased from Molecular Probes. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. Mutagenesis and Protein Purification—The pGEM-T/HslVU vector was constructed as described previously (6Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Shin D.H. Rohrwild M. Kang M.S. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol.

Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and pGEM-T/HslVU as a template. The PCR reactions were carried out using mutagenic primers. The resulting plasmids were transformed into MC1000H. Substitutions of the nucleotides by mutagenesis were verified by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli strains MC1000H (hslVU::kan) and MC1000LH (lon::tet, hslVU::kan) were constructed as described (19Seong I.S. Oh J.Y. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H.

Reaction mixtures (0.1 ml) contained 0.1 mm peptide, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and appropriate amounts of the purified HslV and HslU or its mutant forms in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8). The release of AMC from the peptide was continuously measured by incubation of the mixtures at 37 °C (λexcitation = 355 nm; λemission = 460 nm) using a fluorometer (Fluostar Optima, BMG LABTECH). The rate of peptide hydrolysis was determined by averaging initial slopes of four independent measurements. ATP hydrolysis was assayed using EnzChek® phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes) with some modification (22Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Reaction buffers contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm ATP. To remove contaminated inorganic phosphates, the buffers were treated with 0.2 mm 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside and 1 unit of purine nucleoside phosphorylase followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. The samples were added with HslV (22 nm) and HslU or its mutant forms (67 nm), and the release of free phosphates from ATP was then monitored by continuous measurement of the absorbance at 360 nm at 37 °C using a spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 2000). The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined by averaging initial slopes of three independent measurements. The degradation of MBP-SulA and α-casein was assayed by incubating reaction mixtures (0.1 ml) for appropriate periods at 37 °C (15Seong I.S. Oh J.Y. Lee J.W. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 0.97 μm MBP-SulA or 4.3 μm α-casein, 44 nm HslV, and 0.13 μm HslU or its mutant forms in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.52 μm creatine phosphokinase. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 30 μl of 0.75 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 7.5% SDS and 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% slab gels (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar), followed by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. Proteins were quantified by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cross-linking Analysis—Cross-linking analysis was performed as described (25Seong I.S. Kang M.S. Choi M.K. Lee J.W. Koh O.J. Wang J. Eom S.H. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures containing 0.13 μm HslU or its mutant forms in 0.1 m HEPES buffer (pH 8), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA were incubated in the absence or presence of 0.18 μm HslV, ATPγS, or both for 5 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the mixtures were treated with glutaraldehyde (0.4% in a total volume of 0.1 ml) and further incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. They were then mixed with 30 μl of 0.75 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 7.5% SDS and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–8% gradient slab gels. Proteins in the gels were visualized by silver staining. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Gel filtration was performed using Waters 626 HPLC equipped with a KW-804 GFC column (Shodex) at room temperature. Aliquots (0.1 ml) of HslU or its mutant forms (1.67 μm) were injected to the column that had been equilibrated with 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. When necessary, 1 mm ATP was also included in the buffer. Fractions (82 μl each) were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Generation of Mutations in GYVG Pore Motif—To determine the importance of the GYVG motif of HslU in protein unfolding and translocation, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to replace each residue in the pore motif as below. Since a large motion of Tyr91 in the GYVG pore motif is apparent during nucleotide-dependent interconversion of HslU conformation between the open and closed states (17Wang J. Song J.J. Seong I.S. Franklin M.C. Kamtekar S. Eom S.H. Chung C.H. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we speculated that Gly90 and/or Gly93 might provide the flexibility for the motion. In addition, both Gly residues are strictly conserved in all of the ATPases of two component ATP-dependent proteases, whereas only Gly93 is conserved in Lon and FtsH, the ATP-dependent proteases that have the ATPase and protease domains within a single polypeptide (Fig. 1C). Therefore, we replaced both Gly residues by Pro with an expectation that the rigid residues might obstruct the movement of the GYVG motif (Fig. 2A). We also replaced Gly93 by Ala. Sequence comparison also revealed that FtsH has a Phe residue in place of Tyr at the second position of the GYVG motif, while Lon contains Ile in place of Val at its third position (Fig. 1C). Therefore, we replaced Tyr91 and Val92 by Phe and Ile (Fig. 2A). The Tyr and Val residues were also replaced by Cys, Ala, and Ser, which have relatively small side chains. All of the HslU mutant proteins were then purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 2B). Effects of GYVG Mutations on Degradation of SulA, a Natively Folded Protein—SulA is a cell division inhibitor encoded by the SOS-inducible sfiA gene (26Schoemaker J.M. Gayda R.C. Markovitz A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 551-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bi E. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1118-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). HslVU as well as Lon have previously been shown to degrade the inhibitor protein (19Seong I.S. Oh J.Y. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Mizusawa S. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 29Khattar M.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of the mutations in the GYVG motif on the degradation of proteins with natively folded structures, the HslU mutant proteins were incubated with SulA and HslV. Among the Tyr91 and Val92 mutant proteins, Y91F, V92I, V92A, and V92S could support the SulA degradation by HslV although to less extents than wild-type HslU (Fig. 3A). The inability of the Tyr91 mutant proteins, except Y91F, in supporting the HslV-mediated SulA degradation suggests that aromatic ring structures of the 91st residue are essential for the degradation of natively folded proteins, like SulA. On the other hand, the finding that V92A and V92S are capable of supporting the proteolysis suggests the inessentiality of hydrophobic Val92, although it remains unclear why V92F and V92C cannot support it. None of the Gly90 or Gly93 mutant proteins could support the proteolysis. Thus, it appeared that the flexibility of the 90th and 93rd Gly residue is also required for degradation of native proteins. When E. coli cells are under SOS conditions (e.g. UV irradiation or treatment with UV mimicking agents, such as nitrofurantoin), SulA accumulates and blocks the cell growth by inhibiting cell division (26Schoemaker J.M. Gayda R.C. Markovitz A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 551-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Khattar M.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine whether the expression of the HslU mutant proteins with HslV could rescue from the cell growth inhibition under SOS conditions, hsl/lon cells were transformed with the cDNAs for the HslU mutant proteins and HslV and grown on agar plates containing nitrofurantoin. As shown in Fig. 3B, cells expressing Y91F, V92I, V92A, or V92S, but not the others, could survive under the SOS condition. These results suggest that Y91F, V92I, V92A, and V92S are capable of supporting the HslV-mediated SulA degradation in vivo as well as in vitro. Effects of GYVG Mutations on Degradation of Casein, an Unfolded Protein—Unlike SulA that requires both unfolding and translocation for its degradation, unfolded proteins like casein would need only the translocation step for their access into the inner proteolytic chamber of HslV. Casein is known as a natively unfolded protein (30Creamer L.K. Richardson T. Parry D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 211: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the ability of the HslU mutant proteins in supporting the degradation of unfolded proteins using casein as a substrate. All of the Tyr91 and Val92 mutant proteins were capable of supporting the casein degradation by HslV although to varied and lesser extents than wild-type HslU (Fig. 4). Significantly, the preference of amino acids at the 91st and 92nd positions in supporting the casein hydrolysis was similar to that in supporting the SulA degradation. Y91F, V92I, V92A, and V92S, which could support the SulA degradation, were also capable of supporting the casein hydrolysis much better than the others that were unable to support the SulA degradation. These results suggest that unfolding and translocation of protein substrates may occur as a closely coupled process, although the translocation process is less stringent than the unfolding step in the requirement of specific amino acids at the 91st and 92nd positions of the GYVG pore motif. None of the Gly90 or Gly93 mutant proteins could support the HslV-mediated casein hydrolysis, suggesting that the flexibility provided by both Gly residues might be required for the translocation of unfolded polypeptides. However, the inability of G93A and G93P in supporting the hydrolysis of casein as well as of SulA appeared to be due to their inability to form an HslVU complex with HslV (see below). Effects of GYVG Mutations on Hydrolysis of Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC—To determine the effects of the mutations in the GYVG motif on the hydrolysis of small peptides, the HslU mutant proteins were incubated with Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC and HslV. All of the Tyr91 and Val92 mutant proteins supported the HslV-mediated peptide hydrolysis although to varied extents (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, certain HslU mutant proteins (e.g. Y91A and Y91S), which supported the casein degradation less than 25% as well as wild-type HslU, were capable of supporting the peptide hydrolysis nearly twice better than HslU. However, it is unlikely that the preference of the amino acids for peptide hydrolysis is related with the translocation of peptide substrates, because small peptides would not require any facilitated translocation as long as the diameters of the central pores of HslU and HslV are sufficiently large enough for their passage. G90P could support the peptide hydrolysis about 60% as well as wild-type HslU, suggesting that the flexibility of the Gly residue is not essential for peptide hydrolysis. In contrast, neither G93A nor G93P was capable of supporting the peptidase activity of HslV. However, the inability of G93A and G93P in supporting the peptide hydrolysis appeared to be due to their inability to form HslVU complex with HslV (see below). Effects of GYVG Mutations on ATP Hydrolysis—Since the GYVG motif is located next to Walker box A (i.e. P loop motif where ATP binds), we examined whether the mutations in the pore motif might influence the ATPase activity of HslU. The effects of the mutations on ATP cleavage were remarkably well correlated with their effects on the ability of HslU in supporting the hydrolysis of Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC by HslV. The replacement of Tyr91 and Val92 by Ala or Ser, which caused about 2-fold increase in the ability of the HslV-mediated peptide hydrolysis, increased both the basal and HslV-activated ATPase activities of HslU by about 3-fold (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, the replacement of Val92 by Ile and that of Gly90 by Pro resulted in a decrease in the ability of HslU to cleave ATP as well as in its ability to support the peptide hydrolysis although to different extents. Moreover, G93A and G93P, which were unable to support the peptide hydrolysis, showed little or no ATPase activity whether or not HslV was present. Thus, it appeared as if the ability of the HslU proteins in supporting the HslV-mediated peptide hydrolysis was tightly coupled with their ability to cleave ATP. However, we have previously shown that ATP binding to HslU, but not its hydrolysis, is required for HslV-mediated peptide hydrolysis (31Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Seong I.S. Kang M.S. Chung C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this respect, we suspected if the changes in the ability of HslU mutant proteins in supporting the peptide hydrolysis might be due to an alteration in the binding affinity of ATP to HslU. To test this possibility, ATP hydrolysis was assayed by incubating wild-type HslU and its mutant forms with increasing concentrations of ATP in the absence or presence of HslV. The Km values of ATP estimated by double reciprocal analysis were not significantly changed by the mutations of Gly90, Tyr91, and Val92 (data not shown), i.e. the difference was within 30% of that for wild-type HslU, which was 280 μm. These results suggest that the mutations may not grossly alter the affinity of ATP to HslU. ADP binds to HslU with a higher affinity than ATP and acts as a strong inhibitor of HslU ATPase (7Rohrwild M. Coux O. Huang H.C. Moerschell R.P. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5808-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine whether the mutations in the GYVG motif might alter the binding affinity of ADP to HslU, ATP hydrolysis was assayed by incubating HslU or its mutant forms with HslV in the presence of 1 mm ATP and increasing concentrations of ADP. The HslU mutant proteins that showed higher ATPase activity than wild-type HslU (i.e. Y91S, Y91A, V92S, V92A, and V92C) were much less sensitive to inhibition by ADP, compared with the other mutant proteins and wild-type HslU (Fig. 6). From these data, half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of ADP (IC50) against the HslV-activated ATPase activity of these mutant proteins were estimated to be ∼2–4-fold higher than those of the other mutant proteins and wild-type HslU. For example, IC50 for wild-type HslU and Y91S were about 0.12 mm and 0.38 mm, respectively. These results suggest that the replacement of Tyr91 or Val92 by amino acids having relatively small side chains causes a decrease in the affinity of ADP to HslU, which may in turn result in the increase in the ATPase activity. In addition, the hydrophobicity of the side chains, particularly of the 91st residue, appears to influence the affinity of ADP to HslU, because Y91C, unlike V92C, was much more sensitive to ADP than Y91S. However, we cannot exclude a possibility that the changes in the inhibitory effect of ADP on ATP hydrolysis could also be due to alterations in the binding affinity of ATP to HslU by the mutations, since the precise Kd values of ATP and ADP could not be determined. Effects of GYVG Mutations on HslVU Complex Formation— ATPγS, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, supports the HslVU complex formation and the peptide hydrolysis by HslVU better than ATP (32Yoo S.J. Shim Y.K. Seong I.S. Seol J.H. Kang M.S. Chung C.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, ADP causes the dissociation of HslVU complex into HslV dodecamer and HslU hexamer and prevents the peptide hydrolysis (14Seol J.H. Yoo S.J. Shin D.H. Shim Y.K. Kang M.S. Goldberg A.L.

To determine whether the HslU mutant proteins showing higher ATPase activity than wild-type HslU (i.e. Y91S, Y91A, V92S, V92A, and V92C) might have reduced affinities to ADP, and therefore their complexes with HslV show a lower tendency of dissociation than wild-type HslVU complex, we performed cross-linking analysis. Since ATP hydrolysis by HslU during incubation period for cross-linking markedly reduces the formation of HslVU complex, we used ATPγS instead of ATP. Among the mutant proteins, Y91S was first subjected to incubation with HslV and ATPγS in"

Mouse Pelle-like kinase (mPLK, homolog of human IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)) participates in inflammatory signaling. We evaluated IRS-1 as a novel substrate for mPLK that may contribute to linking inflammation with insulin resistance. Wild-type mPLK, but not a kinase-inactive mutant (mPLK-KD), directly phosphorylated full-length IRS-1 in vitro. This in vitro phosphorylation was increased when mPLK was immunoprecipitated from tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-treated cells. In NIH-3T3IR cells, wild-type mPLK (but not mPLK-KD) co-immunoprecipitated with IRS-1. This association was increased by treatment of cells with TNF-α. Using mass spectrometry, we identified Ser24 in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of IRS-1 as a specific phosphorylation site for mPLK. IRS-1 mutants S24D or S24E (mimicking phosphorylation at Ser24) had impaired ability to associate with insulin receptors resulting in diminished tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and impaired ability of IRS-1 to bind and activate PI-3 kinase in response to insulin. IRS-1-S24D also had an impaired ability to mediate insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 in rat adipose cells. Importantly, endogenous mPLK/IRAK was activated in response to TNF-α or interleukin 1 treatment of primary adipose cells. In addition, using a phospho-specific antibody against IRS-1 phosphorylated at Ser24, we found that interleukin-1 or TNF-α treatment of Fao cells stimulated increased phosphorylation of endogenous IRS-1 at Ser24. We conclude that IRS-1 is a novel physiological substrate for mPLK. TNF-α-regulated phosphorylation at Ser24 in the pleckstrin homology domain of IRS-1 by mPLK/IRAK represents an additional mechanism for cross-talk between inflammatory signaling and insulin signaling that may contribute to metabolic insulin resistance.

These studies suggest an intriguing link between inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. Indeed, IκB kinase β (IKKβ), a critical mediator of inflammatory signaling pathways activating NF-κB, has been identified as an important inhibitor of metabolic insulin signaling pathways (9Yuan M.

Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Inactivation of IKKβ signaling increases insulin sensitivity, whereas overexpression of IKKβ or activation of IKKβ by pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α) leads to insulin resistance (9Yuan M. Konstantopoulos N. Lee J. Hansen L. Li Z.W. Karin M. Shoelson S.E. Science. 2001; 293: 1673-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar, 12Kim J.K. Kim Y.J. Fillmore J.J. Chen Y. Moore I. Lee J.

Similarly, JNK is another inflammatory signaling molecule that may play a role in the insulin resistance of obesity (13Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L. Gorgun C.Z. Uysal K.T. Maeda K. Karin M. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 2002; 420: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). One potential explanation for these observations is cross-talk between inflammatory signaling and metabolic insulin signaling pathways. Metabolic actions of insulin such as enhanced glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and adipose tissue are regulated by activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Although other IRS family members including IRS-2, -3, and -4 share similar structures, IRS isoforms have both overlapping and distinct functions (14Nystrom F.H. Quon M.J. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For example, IRS-1 knock-out mice have a phenotype of growth retardation and insulin resistance, whereas IRS-2 knock-out mice have a phenotype of frank diabetes due to β-cell failure (15Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Bruning J.C. Haag III, B. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 16Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J.

Thus, IRS-1 seems to be the most important IRS isoform for mediating the metabolic effects of insulin in skeletal muscle and fat. Specific tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs on IRS-1 serve as docking sites for binding and activation of PI-3 kinase. Lipid products of PI 3-kinase stimulate activation of the serine kinase phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 that then phosphorylates and activates downstream serine kinases including Akt (protein kinase B) and protein kinase Cζ. These downstream PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling molecules promote translocation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell surface, resulting in increased glucose uptake into the cell (for review of metabolic insulin signaling pathways see Ref. 14Nystrom F.H. Quon M.J. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation sites on IRS-1 that are necessary for propagation of metabolic insulin signaling, IRS-1 contains numerous serine residues that are phosphorylated in response to treatment of cells with a variety of agents including insulin and TNF-α (17Tanti J.F.

Increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is generally associated with impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the insulin receptor, decreased IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase binding and activity, and insulin resistance (17Tanti J.F.

Interestingly, a number of PI 3-kinase-dependent serine kinases including Akt, protein kinase Cζ, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 can phosphorylate IRS-1 on serine residues and may participate in feedback regulation of insulin signal transduction (25Paz K.

Moreover, activation of pro-inflammatory kinases IKKβ and JNK leads to increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 and insulin resistance (29Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F.

Other serine residues in the C-terminal region of IRS-1 (e.g. Ser612) also undergo phosphorylation in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines (33Rotter V. Nagaev I. Smith U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45777-45784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). The identity of kinases that directly phosphorylate these specific serine residues on IRS-1 in response to activation of IKKβ or treatment with pro-inflammatory cytokines remains unclear. In addition, other unidentified serine phosphorylation sites on IRS-1 and additional pro-inflammatory kinases may also participate in cross-talk between inflammatory signaling and insulin signaling. Thus, detailed molecular mechanisms relating inflammation with insulin resistance remain incompletely understood. Mouse Pelle-like kinase (mPLK) is a Ser/Thr kinase homologous to the Drosophila innate immune kinase Pelle and is the mouse homologue of the human IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) (34Vigon I. Mornon J.P. Cocault L. Mitjavila M.T. Tambourin P. Gisselbrecht S. Souyri M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5640-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In response to TNF-α or IL-1β stimulation, IRAK-1 is recruited to the IL-1 receptor complex through the adaptor MyD88 (35Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), where IRAK-1 subsequently becomes phosphorylated. IRAK-1 then interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor 6, TGFβ-activating kinase, and NF-κB-inducing kinase (36Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). mPLK catalytic activity is required for full activation of the TNF-α pathway, leading to NF-κB activation. However, physiological substrates for mPLK/IRAK-1 have not been conclusively identified. Because mPLK participates in activation of IKKβ, JNK, and NF-κB, we hypothesized that IRS-1 may be a novel substrate for mPLK, which mediates cross-talk between pro-inflammatory signaling and insulin signaling pathways. In the present study we identified Ser24 in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of IRS-1 as a phosphorylation site for mPLK that may contribute to insulin resistance. mPLK-WT and mPLK-KD—cDNA for full-length wild type mPLK with a C-terminal Myc-epitope tag was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 as described (45Trofimova M.

The immunocomplex was washed once with cell lysis buffer, once with buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and twice with buffer C (20 mm Tris. pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). The immunocomplex was then incubated in kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP) with 10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP and either purified full-length IRS-1 (1 μg) (Upstate Biotechnology) or purified GST-IRS-1 fusion proteins (2 μg) for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and exposed to x-ray film or phosphor screens for autoradiography or PhosphorImager analysis (Storm 860, Amersham Biosciences Corp.). NIH-3T3IR cells transiently transfected with IRS-1-WT, IRS-1-S24A, IRS-1-S24D, or IRS-1-S24E were serum-starved overnight and treated without or with insulin (100 nm, 5 min). Cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody to recover recombinant IRS-1 proteins. ⅘ of each sample was used for detection of co-immunoprecipitated p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase by immunoblotting with anti-p85 antibody. The remainder of the sample immunoprecipitate was used to detect IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity. For each sample, 10 μg of sonicated phosphatidylinositol substrate (Sigma) was incubated with 50 μl of PI 3-kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2) and with 10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 0.1 n HCl. Phospholipid was extracted with 200 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1). The organic phase was collected and applied to silica gel thin layer chromatography plates (Whatman) pre-activated with 1% potassium oxalate. Thin layer chromatography was performed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:12.3:2). The plates were dried, and results were visualized by autoradiography. Quantification was done by PhosphorImager analysis, and results were normalized for the amount of IRS-1 recovered by immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. The immune complex was pulled down with protein A/G beads. The beads were washed three times with cell lysis buffer, and then samples were mixed with SDS-sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blotted with antibodies as indicated. Rat adipose cells were co-transfected by electroporation with GLUT4-HA and either IRS-1-WT or IRS-1-S24D as described (50Quon M.J. Zarnowski M.J. Guerre-Millo M. de la Luz Sierra M. Taylor S.I.

After 20 h cells were processed and treated with insulin at final concentrations of 0, 0.07, or 60 nm for 30 min at 37 °C. Cell surface epitope-tagged GLUT4 was determined using monoclonal anti-HA antibody (HA-11, Covance) in conjunction with 125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG as described (51Quon M.J. Chen H. Ing B.L.

One μl of tryptic-digested IRS-1 sample was co-crystallized with 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid and spotted directly on a stainless steel matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) plate. Mass spectra were acquired using an Applied Biosystems 4700 MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For all mass spectra the laser frequency was 200 Hz, and for collision-induced dissociation the collision energy was 1 keV (air was used as the collision gas). MALDI spectra were internally calibrated (<20 ppm) using trypsin autolysis products. Post-acquisition base-line correction and smoothing was carried out using the software provided with the instrument. Spectra were submitted to Mascot (matrixscience.com) for peptide mass fingerprinting. The phospho-peptide DVRKVGYLRKPKpSMHK (pS, phosphorylated Ser) was synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as an antigen. New Zealand White rabbits were immunized and boosted three times with the conjugate. Anti-serum was further purified by collecting through an affinity column that was coupled with the non-phosphorylated DVRKVGYLRKPKSMHK peptide. Insulin Target Cells Express mPLK/IRAK—We first examined whether mPLK (or its orthologue such as IRAK) is endogenously expressed in cells from metabolic and vascular insulin target tissues. Endogenous IRAK was detected in lysates of both rat adipose cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) by immunoblotting with anti-IRAK antibody (Fig. 1A). In addition, we also detected endogenous mPLK/IRAK in COS-7 cells and NIH-3T3IR cells. Using an antibody that can detect the activated form of mPLK/IRAK (52Mamidipudi V. Lin C. Seibenhener M.L. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4161-4165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we found that IL-1β or TNF-α treatment of primary adipose cells or endothelial cells activated endogenous mPLK/IRAK in insulin target cells (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, treatment of Fao hepatoma cells with insulin also activated mPLK/IRAK at levels comparable with those observed in response to IL-1β (data not shown). IRS-1 Is a Direct Substrate for mPLK in Vitro—We next tested whether mPLK can directly phosphorylate IRS-1 in vitro. An immune-complex kinase assay was performed using full-length purified IRS-1 as substrate and recombinant mPLK-WT or mPLK-KD immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected NIH-3T3IR cells treated without or with TNF-α (Fig. 2). IRS-1 underwent significant phosphorylation only in the presence of mPLK-WT (Fig. 2, A and C, lanes 3 and 4) but not when incubated with mPLK-KD (A and C, lanes 5 and 6) or control samples (A and C, lanes 1 and 2). Moreover, mPLK-WT immunoprecipitated from cells treated with TNF-α was able to phosphorylate IRS-1 to a greater extent than mPLK-WT from untreated cells (Fig. 2, A and C, cf. lanes 3 and 4). As expected, mPLK-WT (but not mPLK-KD) underwent autophosphorylation that was increased by TNF-α treatment (Fig. 2A, lower panel, lanes 3 and 4). Immunobl"

The viral nucleocapsid (N) protein plays an essential role in viral RNA packaging. In this study, recombinant SARS-CoV N protein was shown to be dimeric by analytical ultracentrifugation, size exclusion chromatography coupled with light scattering, and chemical cross-linking. Dimeric N proteins self-associate into tetramers and higher molecular weight oligomers at high concentrations. The dimerization domain of N was mapped through studies of the oligomeric states of several truncated mutants. Although mutants consisting of residues 1–210 and 1–284 fold as monomers, constructs consisting of residues 211–422 and 285–422 efficiently form dimers. When in excess, the truncated construct 285–422 inhibits the homodimerization of full-length N protein by forming a heterodimer with the full-length N protein. These results suggest that the N protein oligomerization involves the C-terminal residues 285–422, and this region is a good target for mutagenic studies to disrupt N protein self-association and virion assembly.

The M protein of coronavirus is the most abundant protein component of the envelope. This protein plays a predominant role in the formation and release of the virion envelope. When co-expressed with the E protein, virus-like particles with sizes and shapes similar to those of virions are assembled (8Vennema H. Godeke G.J. Rossen J.W. Voorhout W.F. Horzinek M.C.

Recently, virus-like particles of SARS-CoV were obtained by recombinant expression of S, E, and M proteins in insect cells (10Mortola E. Roy P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Inside the envelope, the N protein associates with the genomic RNA to form a long, flexible, helical ribonucleo-protein. The N protein is typically 350–450 amino acids in length, highly basic, and serine-phosphorylated, but the extent and physiological relevance of phosphorylation is unclear (11Wilbur S.M. Nelson G.W.

Virol. 1979; 32: 672-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its structural role, several additional functions are postulated for the N protein including viral RNA synthesis, transcription, translation, and virus budding (13Lai M.M. Cavanagh D. Adv. Virus Res. 1997; 48: 1-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14He R. Leeson A. Andonov A. Li Y. Bastien N. Cao J. Osiowy C. Dobie F. Cutts T. Ballantine M. Li X. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The mouse hepatitis virus N protein was first shown in 1986 to have RNA binding activity by NorthWestern assay (16Robbins S.G. Frana M.F. McGowan J.J. Boyle J.F. Holmes K.V. Virology. 1986; 150: 402-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Based on sequence analysis, Parker and Masters (17Parker M.M. Masters P.S. Virology. 1990; 179: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) suggest that the N protein consists of three highly conserved domains separated by variable spacer regions. Although lacking sequence homology to previously described RNA-binding motifs, the central domain of N protein has been shown to be the RNA-binding region by several laboratories (18Masters P.S. Arch. Virol. 1992; 125: 141-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Nelson G.W. Stohlman S.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1975-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Peng D.

Virol. 2000; 81: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of the N-terminal region consisting of residues 49–178 of SARS-CoV N protein has been determined by NMR (22Huang Q. Yu L. Petros A.M. Gunasekera A. Liu Z. Xu N. Hajduk P. Mack J. Fesik S.W. Olejniczak E.T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although the structure reveals a fold similar to the U1A RNA-binding protein (22Huang Q. Yu L. Petros A.M. Gunasekera A. Liu Z. Xu N. Hajduk P. Mack J. Fesik S.W. Olejniczak E.T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), whether this N-terminal domain indeed binds RNA remains to be determined. Although the RNA binding property of the N protein has been extensively studied, the self-association activity of the N protein is rather poorly characterized. The results in this report show that the recombinant full-length N protein is dimeric with a propensity to form tetramers and higher molecular weight oligomers. The dimerization region is mapped to the C-terminal 138 residues, and the homodimer formation of the N homodimer is inhibited by excess truncated mutant containing the dimerization domain. Protein Expression and Purification—DNA encoding full-length SARS-CoV (strain GD01) N protein (amino acids 1–422) was cloned into plasmid pET21a (Novagen). The PCR primers contained the native initiating methionine codon and a stop codon immediately following the last residue of N protein. The correct DNA sequence was confirmed on both strands of the plasmid. BL21 Star Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen) transformed with the expression plasmids were grown to the log phase, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and harvested by centrifugation 4 h after induction. The cell pellets were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and stored at -80 °C until protein purification. Thawed pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES at pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) and lysed by French press. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 75,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences; SP Sepharose Fast Flow). The column was washed with 5 column volumes of lysis buffer followed by 2 column volumes of 25 mm HEPES at pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The bound N protein was eluted with 25 mm HEPES at pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Fractions containing N protein were pooled and dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES at pH 8.0, 170 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, loaded onto a second cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences; Source 15S), and eluted with a gradient of NaCl. Further purification was achieved by size exclusion chromatography in lysis buffer (Amersham Biosciences; Superdex 200). DNA encoding different N protein fragments were cloned into a pET-like vector (pETTEV281), which contains an N-terminal His6 tag and the cleavage site of tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. Cells were grown similarly to the full-length N protein, harvested, and broken by French press in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris at pH 7.2 and 150 mm NaCl). After centrifugation (75,000 × g, 30 min), the supernatant was loaded onto a cobalt column (Clontech) pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer. After washing with lysis buffer followed by lysis buffer plus 5 mm imidazole, the protein was eluted with lysis buffer plus 200 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the target protein were pooled and dialyzed into TEV protease cleavage buffer (25 mm Tris at pH 7.2, 25 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). TEV protease was added to 5% (w/w), and the reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 7–10 h. SDS-PAGE was used to monitor the completeness of the cleavage. Cation exchange (Amersham Biosciences; Source 15S) or size exclusion chromatography (Amersham Biosciences; Superdex 200) was used to further purify the proteins. Nucleic Acid Binding Assays—ssDNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, and yeast tRNA was obtained commercially (Roche Applied Science). N protein (10 μm final concentration) and oligonucleotides were mixed at increasing molar ratios of nucleic acid to protein from 1:10 to 10:1 in 25 mm HEPES at pH 8.0, 100 mm KOAc, and 1.7 mm Mg(OAc)2 and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The protein/nucleic acid mixtures were electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gels in Tris acetate buffer (100 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 1.25 mm, NaOAc, and 1 mm EDTA) in the presence of ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml final concentration). Nucleic acid was directly visualized on a short wavelength UV transilluminator. The gels were then fixed in 40% (v/v) methanol with 10% (v/v) acetic acid, dried under vacuum, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to visualize protein bands. Size Exclusion Chromatography Light Scattering (SEC-LS)—The molecular masses of full-length N proteins were determined using SEC-LS in the HHMI Biopolymer Facility and the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University by Ewa Folta-Stogniew. Briefly, a sample containing ∼300 μg of N protein was filtered through a 0.22-μm Durapore membrane (Millipore) and applied to a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with an in-line Dawn EOS laser light-scattering apparatus (Wyatt Technology Corp.), refractometer (Wyatt Technology Corp.), and UV detector (Waters Corp.). The weight average molecular mass of the elution peak was calculated using ASTRA software as described (23Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.R. J. Biomol. Techniques. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments were conducted using a Beckman Optimal XL-I ultracentrifuge with an An60 Ti four-hole rotor and the interference optical detection system. The protein samples were dialyzed to osmotic equilibrium against the buffer (25 mm HEPES at pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA), and solvent density was determined using an Anton-Paar DMA 5000 density meter. In the sedimentation velocity experiments, samples at 1 and 25 μm were spun at 42,000 rpm, 20 °C, and 150 scans were collected at 2-min intervals. Continuous sedimentation coefficient distributions were calculated using the c(s) module from the software package Sedfit (version 8.9). Analyses of the sedimentation velocity profiles were also performed by direct boundary modeling from solutions of the Lamm equation using the non-interaction discrete species module of Sedfit as described (24Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar, 25Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D. Biophys.

Sedimentation equilibrium studies were performed at three different protein concentrations (5, 34, and 65 μm) at 7000 rpm, 20 °C. The partial-specific volume of the protein was calculated using the program Sednterp. Time-independent and radial independent corrections were determined and subtracted from the final scans after the samples had reached equilibrium for the initial rotor speed only (26Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Corrected data were modeled with either the program Winnonlin (version 1.06) for non-linear least squares analysis of equilibrium data or the program Sedphat (version 1.9) (26Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Cross-linking Experiments—Protein (5 μm in 20 mm HEPES at pH 8.0 with 100 mm NaCl) was chemically cross-linked with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) (Pierce) (0–4 mm) at room temperature for 30 min and quenched by adding Tris (pH 6.8) to a 20 mm final concentration. Reaction mixtures were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Expression and Purification of Recombinant SARS-CoV N Protein—The N protein of SARS-CoV is a highly basic protein of 422 residues, where 14.2 mol % are lysines and arginines as opposed to 8.5 mol % glutamates and aspartates. To study the biochemical properties of the SARS-CoV N protein, full-length N protein without additional tags was expressed in E. coli cells (Fig. 1A). The protein was purified from the soluble fraction of cell lysate by cation exchange chromatography, taking advantage of its basic nature (isoelectric point = 10.9). The absorbance ratio at 260 and 280 nm is 0.47, indicating that the purified protein is free of nucleic acids. The molecular mass of the N protein was determined by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy to be 45,877 Da, which is 148 Da less than the theoretical molecular mass (46,025 Da). The difference in the mass could be caused by posttranslational removal of the N-terminal methionine (mass difference of 131 Da), as is often seen in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins (27Flinta C.

Biochem. 1998; 260: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The mass spectroscopy result suggests that the recombinant SARS-CoV N protein is not phosphorylated. Purified N protein elutes as a sharp peak with an apparent molecular mass of 250 kDa in the gel filtration chromatogram, suggesting the formation of higher molecular weight oligomers (Fig. 1B). However, sedimentation velocity experiments (see below) suggest that the N protein is asymmetric, and its average hydrodynamic radius might be much larger than that of a globular protein of equivalent mass. As a result, the retention time of N protein on a gel filtration column will be unusually short, and the apparent 250 kDa mass of the N protein oligomer is likely an overestimate. Recombinant N Protein Binds to Nonspecific DNA and RNA—The binding of SARS-CoV N protein to nucleic acids was analyzed by native gel shift assays. Nonspecific RNA and DNA binding by native CoV N protein was reported previously (16Robbins S.G. Frana M.F. McGowan J.J. Boyle J.F. Holmes K.V. Virology. 1986; 150: 402-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Masters P.S. Arch. Virol. 1992; 125: 141-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Baric R.S. Nelson G.W. Fleming J.O.

Virology. 2000; 277: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, oligonucleotide binding was used as a test for proper folding of the recombinant protein. Since a specific RNA sequence has not been identified as the ligand for the SARS-CoV N protein, nonspecific nucleic acids were used, including bakers' yeast tRNA and a 54-base ssDNA (Fig. 2). In these assays, the SARS-CoV N protein was kept at a constant concentration for all reactions, and only the amount of nucleic acid was changed. The reaction mixtures were subjected to agarose gel assays similar to those established for alphavirus in vitro assembly experiments (31Tellinghuisen T.L. Hamburger A.E. Fisher B.R. Ostendorp R. Kuhn R.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5309-5319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 0.8% agarose gel in the presence of ethidium bromide. Nucleic acids were visualized by UV irradiation, and protein bands were identified by staining the gel with Coomassie Blue. The formation of the N protein/nucleic acid complex is detected by co-migration of protein and nucleotide. In the absence of nucleotide binding, the N protein migrates in the opposite direction of complex due to the native gel conditions and its positive charge. As the amount of nucleic acid increases, N protein co-migrates into the gel, indicating the formation of an N protein/nucleic acid complex. A dramatic shift in the mobility of the nucleic acid in the protein/nucleic acid mixtures in comparison with free nucleic acid is observed. At a 1:1 molar ratio, the N protein/nucleic acid complex forms a discrete band, and at nucleic acids:protein molar ratios higher than 1:1, the complex migrates as a smear in the native agarose gel, indicating the presence of heterogeneity in the complex. Finally, the effect of ionic strength on the binding of nucleic acids was analyzed by adding KOAc to reaction mixtures. Complex formation is not impaired by up to 500 mm KOAc (data not shown), suggesting strong association of N protein with both ssDNA and tRNA. Self-association of the Recombinant N Protein—To accurately determine the oligomeric state of the SARS-CoV N protein, we carried out size exclusion chromatography coupled with continuous measurement of laser light-scattering and refractive index of the eluted sample (SEC-LS). In this approach, size exclusion chromatography only serves as a fractionation step. The molecular mass determination is independent of the elution position from the sizing column and depends only on the light-scattering and refractive index. Based on analyses of 14 protein standards, the molecular mass of proteins in solution can be determined by the SEC-LS technique with an accuracy of ± 5% (23Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.R. J. Biomol. Techniques. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant N protein eluted from Superose 6 as a single peak (Fig. 3A). The molecular mass of the eluted protein at each point of the chromatogram ranges from 75 to 115 kDa, indicating that the sample contains a mixture of molecules with different molar masses (Fig. 3A). The mass average of the molecular mass is 92.7 kDa, which is in excellent agreement with that of a dimer (theoretic value 92.0 kDa). To determine whether the polydispersity of the N protein measured by SEC-LS resulted from co-elution of dimers with higher molecular weight oligomers, both velocity and equilibrium sedimentation analytical ultracentrifugation were performed. Sedimentation velocity measures the rate at which molecules move in response to centrifugal force and provides information about the mass and shape of the molecule. The sedimentation coefficient distributions of N protein samples at 1 and 25 μm show one major peak, centered at a sedimentation coefficient of 3.9 ± 0.3 S, which corresponds to the N protein dimer (Fig. 3B). Based on the fact that the dimer peak remains as the major peak at 1 μm concentration, the dissociation constant of the dimer/monomer is likely to be less than 1 μm. In addition, there are several small peaks in Fig. 3B, suggesting that the sample is heterogeneous. Because the sample is more than 95% pure, as suggested by mass spectroscopy, the presence of molecules with multiple sedimentation coefficient values is possibly caused by reversible self-association of the N protein and not by impurities. However, the dimer/oligomer equilibriums may not be fast on the velocity time scale, which could lead to significant changes in species distributions over the course of an experiment. It is therefore difficult and less accurate to derive the molecular mass and binding constants (Kd values) from sedimentation velocity data. Therefore, to further characterize the self-association of the N protein, equilibrium sedimentation experiments were carried out. At equilibrium, the balance of sedimentation force and diffusion of the sample produces a gradient in protein concentration across the centrifuge cell. The concentration distribution at equilibrium is independent of the shape of the molecule and depends only on the molecular mass. This technique is particularly valuable for studying self-association of proteins because the overall mass distribution reflects the equilibrium of the association process. Centrifugation was carried out for 48 h at three protein concentrations (5, 34, and 65 μm), and the data were then simultaneously analyzed (Fig. 3C). Fitting a single species model to these data showed significant asymmetry in the residuals (data not shown), suggesting that the sample is a mixture of different species. A satisfactory fit was obtained when a reversible dimer/tetramer association model was used (Fig. 3C). The calculated mass is 92.4 ± 0.5 kDa for the dimer, which is consistent with the SEC-LS measurements. The dissociation constant for the tetramer/dimer formation is estimated at 2 mm. Because both SEC-LS and ultracentrifugation measurements suggest that the dimeric N protein is in equilibrium with higher molecular weight species, we carried out chemical cross-linking experiments to covalently stabilize different oligomers. Purified N protein was incubated with the cross-linking reagent BS3 at a series of BS3 concentrations from 0.05 to 2 mm. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3D). In the presence of the cross-linker, three protein bands are evident, migrating at apparent molecular weights corresponding to one, two, and four N protein polypeptide chains. As the concentration of cross-linking reagent is increased, bands corresponding to oligomers larger than a tetramer also appear. The absence of a trimeric band suggests that dimeric, not monomeric, N protein is the building block of the oligomers. To test whether the oligomeric formation is dependent of nucleic acids, the N protein was incubated with RNase and DNase prior to cross-linking. Identical results were obtained with and without RNase/DNase treatment (not shown), indicating that the N protein forms a dimer in the absence of nucleic acids. Mapping the Dimerization Domain—To determine the primary sequence requirements for N protein homo-interactions, several constructs encoding truncated N protein were overexpressed and purified (Fig. 4A). An N-terminal His6 tag was engineered in all constructs to facilitate purification and was removed by TEV protease digestion before analysis. The first two constructs, NF1 and NF2 (NF stands for N protein fragment), residues 1–210 and 211–422, respectively, split the full-length protein into two halves. NF3 and NF4, residues 1–284 and 285–422, respectively, were designed to further narrow down the dimerization domain. The oligomerization state of each construct was first probed by chemical cross-linking (Fig. 4B). NF1, which contains the N-terminal 210 residues of the N protein, remained monomeric even in the presence of 4 mm BS3. The C-terminal half of the protein (NF2) cross-linked to a dimer, suggesting that the dimerization domain is located in the C-terminal region. Next, smaller fragments of the N protein were subcloned to pinpoint the dimerization domain. Among them, only NF3 (residues 1–284) and NF4 (residues 285–422) were stably expressed in bacteria and remained soluble during purification. Cross-linking experiments showed that NF3 is monomeric and that NF4 forms dimers (Fig. 4B). Unlike the full-length N protein, NF2 and NF4 do not form oligomers larger than dimers in cross-linking experiments. The concentration of cross-linking reagent was increased to 4 mm, which is twice that used for the full-length N. However, no obvious band corresponding to oligomers larger than dimers was observed. As a different approach to oligomer size assessment, the native molecular masses of all four truncated constructs were determined by SEC-LS. As shown in Table I, the molecular masses of NF1 and NF3 match well with the monomer masses predicted by amino acid composition. NF2 is predicted to have a molecular mass of 23.4 kDa, and the mass determined by SEC-LS is 49.0 kDa. NF4 is also confirmed to be a dimer with a mass of 31.8 kDa (theoretical dimer, 30.8 kDa). In addition, analytical ultracentrifugation results were consistent with that of the chemical cross-linking and SEC-LS analysis (data not shown). Taken together, our results demonstrate"

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3017-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), suggesting that other FA proteins may be involved in this process. In both homologous recombination and collapsed replication forks, Holliday junction DNA may exist as an intermediate. We hypothesized that FANCD2 protein may bind to Holliday junction DNA as part of its function in DNA damage repair.As a first step in the characterization of FANCD2 in the repair of DNA, we expressed and purified full-length wild-type and mutant FANCD2. We found that the unmodified protein has DNA binding activity specific for Holliday junction DNA, and FANCD2 also binds with high affinity to DNA double strand ends.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression and Purification of FANCD2 Proteins—Recombinant full-length wild-type and mutant FANCD2 and wild-type FANCA were each expressed using recombinant baculovirus infected insect cells. The encoded FA proteins contained at the amino terminus a zz domain, for purification on IgG-Sepharose. Tagged genes were cloned into a modified pFastBac vector (Invitrogen) and processed to generate recombinant baculovirus and used to infect Sf9 insect cells using standard procedures. After 72 h, the infected cells (1 × 108) were harvested and washed in chilled phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in 15 ml of buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 200 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The pre-equilibrated 250 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added into the protein lysate and incubated with mixing at 4 °C for 16 h. The protein-IgG-Sepharose complexes were washed two times with buffer B, two times with buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 200 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), four times with TEV cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and resuspended in 300 μl of TEV cleavage buffer plus 18 μg of TEV enzyme. Beads containing the bound fusion protein were incubated with the TEV protease at 4 °C for 16 h. The supernatant contained FANCD2 protein and TEV protease. After elution, each FANCD2 or FANCA protein had appended to its amino terminus nine amino acids derived from the expression construct: Ser-Gly-Thr-Val-Asp-Gly-Ala-Gly-Gln. Details of the baculoviral vector are available from the authors.FANCD2 fragments containing amino acid residues 1–989, 1–472, 473–989, and 945–1451 were expressed in Escherichia coli. The cDNA for each FANCD2 fragment was tagged at the 3′-end, replacing the stop codon with a hexahistidine tag (pET-21a(+) vector; Novagen), and the fusion proteins were expressed in Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) using standard procedures. The FANCD2 fragments were purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen), followed by a purification step using a Bio-Scale Q column (Bio-Rad). The NH2-terminal domain (35–339 amino acids) of FANCD2 was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion, using standard procedures. The concentrations of the FANCD2 proteins were determined by comparing the intensities of the Coomassie-stained FANCD2 bands on a protein gel to quantitation standards of ovalbumin on the same gel. The aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C.DNA Binding Assay—The Holliday junction oligonucleotide substrate contained four strands with a 10-base mobile junction similar to the probe described earlier (37Constantinou A.

The plasmid used as a competitor was the 4775 bp pFastBac vector (Invitrogen). The linear duplex DNA (5000 bp) was singly cut DNA of pFastBac vector using restriction enzyme HindIII. The linear duplex DNA with average size of 500 bp was pFastBac vector digested with restriction enzyme HinfI.For the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, binding reactions contained 7.4 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 ng of DNA substrate, 0–50 ng of competitor DNAs and different FANCD2 proteins in a volume of 10 μl.

Blood. 2002; 100: 2414-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), we tested whether the FANCD2 protein binds to DNA. The full-length human FANCD2 protein was expressed in insect cells and purified via an associated zz-domain affinity tag. Full-length FANCD2 was released from the matrix after cleavage by the TEV protease at a site at the amino terminus. By Coomassie staining, greater than 90% of the protein detected migrated at about 160 kDa, consistent with full-length, unmodified FANCD2 (Fig. 1A, left). The concentration of the FANCD2 protein was determined by comparing the intensity of the band in lane 4 to quantitation standards on the same gel (data not shown). A typical protein preparation from 1 × 108 Sf9 cells contained 0.5 nmol (90 μg) of FANCD2 protein at a concentration of 1.7 μm. The 160-kDa band was confirmed to be FANCD2 by immunoblot using an antibody specific for FANCD2 (Fig. 1A, right).We hypothesized that the FANCD2 protein binds to DNA in a structure-specific fashion. Since Holliday junction DNA is a potential intermediate in the homologous recombination pathway, we tested this structure first. In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), full-length FANCD2 retarded the mobility of a 125-bp Holliday junction DNA probe (four 30-bp arms; Fig. 1B, lane 3). Three different recombinant protein preparations from baculovirus-infected cells were analyzed. FANCD2 was compared with FANCA and to a mock purification from empty baculovirus-infected cells. FANCD2 (40 nm) bound to the Holliday junction DNA and migrated in a diffuse shift that formed a band below the origin of the gel. FANCA protein did not bind to the Holliday junction DNA probe at the same concentration of FANCD2 protein (Fig. 1B, lane 2). The shifted bands in the reaction with FANCA (lane 2) were also present in the mock purification from the cells infected with empty virus (lane 1), indicating that these complexes were low level, nonspecific contaminants.FANCD2 was included in DNA binding reactions at different concentrations (Fig. 2A). We observed diffuse bands that migrated progressively slower in reactions with higher FANCD2 concentrations. This finding was most consistent with the interpretation that the protein-DNA complex contained multiple FANCD2 molecules. Since the stoichiometry of DNA binding could not be determined, we did not determine a Kd for the complex. Instead, we estimated binding affinity by the concentration of FANCD2 protein that bound half of the probe. Approximately half of the Holliday junction DNA probe was bound in reactions containing 15 nm FANCD2 (Figs. 2A and 4B).Fig. 2Structure specificity of FANCD2 DNA binding activity.A, EMSAs with full-length FANCD2 (20–60 nm as indicated, lanes 2–4 and 6–8) with 1 ng of Holliday junction 125-bp probe (lanes 1–4) or with 1 ng of a 65-bp linear DNA probe (lanes 5–8).

The competitor DNAs were 125-bp Holliday junction (lanes 3 and 4), supercoiled plasmid (S.C., lanes 5 and 6), linear 5000-bp DNA (lanes 7 and 8), and linear 500-bp DNA (lanes 9 and 10). The effect of the competitor DNA was quantified using PhosphorImager analysis by determining the percent of the probe bound in each reaction. The reaction in lane 2 was the control for each competitor DNA. The concentrations of DNA ends in competitor DNAs were: 25 nm (lane 3), 200 nm (lane 4), 0 nm (lanes 5 and 6), 0.3 nm (lane 7), 2.5 nm (lane 8), 3 nm (lane 9), and 24 nm (lane 10).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Mutant FANCD2 bound to Holliday junction DNA with similar affinity as did the wild-type protein.A, purified protein preparations for mutant FANCD2 proteins containing an aspartate to alanine substitution at codon 1428 (D1428A), a deletion of exon 44 truncating the protein at amino acid 1427 (E44t), and an internal deletion of FANCD2 exon 17 (E17del), which deletes residues 472–515, were analyzed as indicated by SDS-PAGE and detected with Coomassie stain (left panel). A schematic is shown for the wild-type and mutant proteins on the right. B, EMSAs were done with the indicated concentrations of FANCD2 protein with the wild-type FANCD2 (lanes 2–5), D1428A (lanes 6–9), E44t (lanes 11–14), and E17del (lanes 15–18). The reaction in lane 1 had no added FANCD2. The percentage of probe bound was calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 2A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The specificity of DNA binding was determined using various probes and DNA competitors. FANCD2 bound to 65-bp double-stranded linear DNA (Fig. 2A) and to a 65-bp Y-shaped DNA (data not shown). When using a 65-bp linear DNA probe, 50% of the probe was bound at about 20 nm FANCD2, indicating that the binding affinity of FANCD2 to linear 65 bp was modestly decreased relative to the 125-bp Holliday junction probe. As with the Holliday junction probe, the FANCD2-bound DNA formed a diffuse band that had slowed migration as more protein was included in reactions. At the highest protein concentrations tested, the FANCD2-linear DNA complex migrated just beneath the origin of the gel (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). As in the case with the Holliday junction probe (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–4), we interpreted these results with the 65-bp linear probe to indicate that multiple FANCD2 molecules bound to the DNA probe.We tested the specificity of FANCD2 for different forms of DNA using competition reactions. The probe in each reaction was 1 ng of the 125-bp Holliday junction DNA. A 5-fold excess of self-competitor resulted in a 35% reduction of the bound probe (Fig. 2B, lane 3). A 40-fold excess of self-competitor resulted in nearly complete competition (lane 4). Supercoiled plasmid DNA competed modestly with the Holliday junction probe for binding to FANCD2 (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). By contrast, when this same plasmid was cleaved at a single site generating an ~5000-bp linear DNA, the level of competition was similar to the self-competition (Fig. 2B, lanes 7 and 8). Since the principal difference between the supercoiled plasmid and the linear DNA was the presence of DNA ends, we tested whether a higher concentration of DNA ends bound to FANCD2 with higher affinity. Cutting this plasmid at a total of nine sites (average size of the linear DNA was ~500 bp) made this dsDNA the most efficient competitor tested for FANCD2 binding. Nearly complete competition for the Holliday junction probe was observed with a 5-fold excess of the 500-bp linear DNA (Fig. 2B, lane 9). In lanes 5–10, the competitor DNAs were all derived from the same plasmid with the only difference being the number of ends: 0, 2, or 18. These results supported the notion that the FANCD2 binds to DNA ends.In most of the experiments in Figs. 1 and 2, the probe was Holliday junction DNA. FANCD2 binding to the Holliday junction DNA could be due to binding to ends (four ends per molecule) or due to binding to the internal part of the Holliday junction. We directly compared which of these DNA structures bound to FANCD2 with higher specificity. The competitor DNAs were normalized by the moles of DNA ends of unlabeled Holliday junction DNA or 65-bp linear duplex DNA included in reactions with Holliday junction probe. The linear duplex DNA was equivalent in length to two arms of the Holliday junction probe. In this experiment, 1 ng of Holliday junction probe was used; thus, the concentration of the probe was 1.2 nm, but since it had four ends, the concentration of dsDNA ends was about 5 nm. Significant competition for DNA binding by FANCD2 was apparent when reactions contained 25 nm Holliday junction ends (5 ng DNA; Fig. 3, lane 3), but there was very little competition for binding when reactions contained 200 nm 65-bp duplex DNA ends (lane 10). This result suggested that for DNAs of similar size, FANCD2 bound to the Holliday junction DNA with higher affinity than it bound to DNA ends. An alternative model for the specificity was that the ends of the Holliday junction DNA were closely juxtaposed and favored binding of the FANCD2 when compared with the linear DNA. Since FANCD2 bound to both, DNA ends and Holliday junctions, the specificity of the DNA binding activity was consistent with a role for FANCD2 in the repair of double-stranded DNA damage.Fig. 3Comparison of the specificity of FANCD2 for 125-bp Holliday junction DNA versus 65-bp linear DNA. EMSA was performed with 40 nm FANCD2 (lanes 2–10) with Holliday junction probe (1 ng, 1.2 nm probe, 5 nm ends). Reactions in lanes 3–6 contained unlabeled Holliday junction competitor DNA at the concentration of DNA ends indicated (four ends per molecule), and reactions in lanes 7–10 contained unlabeled 65-bp double strand DNA at the indicated concentrations of DNA ends. The percent of probe bound was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 2B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Not all linear DNA molecules were equivalent for binding to FANCD2. When comparing the competition for binding to the Holliday junction probe, the linear 500-bp DNA was the most effective competitor (complete competition with about 3 nm ends; Fig. 2B, lane 9), while the 65-bp linear DNA did not compete (Fig. 3, lanes 7–10). Since the protein-DNA complex was observed as a diffuse band that migrated with progressively slower speed as more FANCD2 was included in reactions, we infer that FANCD2 binds to DNA as a multimer. The competition data were most compatible with the model that the FANCD2 nucleated its binding on the DNA end, and the FANCD2 then spread along the length of the DNA. Thus, when comparing the three linear DNAs tested for binding to FANCD2, the 5000-bp linear DNA had too low a concentration of ends, and the 65-bp linear DNA was too short, but the 500-bp linear DNA had the best balance of DNA ends and length.FANCD2 Mutant and Wild-type Proteins Bound to the DNA with Similar Affinities—The carboxyl terminus of the FANCD2, encoded by exon 44, is highly conserved among homologues in other eukaryotic species, and therefore this domain may have an important cellular function required for mitomycin C resistance (11Timmers C. Taniguchi T. Hejna J. Reifsteck C. Lucas L. Bruun D. Thayer M. Cox B. Olson S. D'Andrea A.D. Moses R. Grompe M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 241-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This domain is highly acidic, containing 12 acidic residues out of 24 residues and is referred to as the “EDGE” domain. We purified a FANCD2 mutant, in which the first aspartic acid residue encoded in exon 44 was converted to alanine (D1428A). In addition, we truncated the acidic domain of FANCD2 (E44t) by expressing a fusion protein, which encodes no exon 44. Complementation studies reveal that expression of these mutants in FANCD2-deficient cells does not correct the FA phenotype (39Montes de Oca R. Andreassen P.R. Margossian S.P. Gregory R.C.

A Fanconi anemia patient-derived mutation, which has no exon 17 (11Timmers C. Taniguchi T. Hejna J. Reifsteck C. Lucas L. Bruun D. Thayer M. Cox B. Olson S. D'Andrea A.D. Moses R. Grompe M. Mol.

All three mutant FANCD2 proteins were expressed and purified similarly as was the wild-type protein (Fig. 4A). Each of these protein preparations was analyzed for binding to Holliday junction DNA (Fig. 4B). Each mutant form of FANCD2 bound to the DNA with an affinity similar to wild-type protein. Removal of an acidic domain, as in the E44t FANCD2, would be predicted to increase affinity of a protein for DNA, but clearly, the magnitude of the effect was very small. The FANCD2 mutant D1428A did bind less avidly to the probe. While wild-type, E44t, and E17del FANCD2 each bound to 50% of the Holliday junction probe at ~15 nm protein, the D1428A mutant bound to 50% of the probe at about 40 nm (Fig. 4B). This decrease in affinity of the mutant FANCD2-D1428A for binding DNA was small and not seen with the E44t truncated protein, in which D1428 was deleted. Furthermore, the patterns of the bands on the gel were similar when comparing the D1428A mutant with the wild-type FANCD2. We thus conclude that these mutations, which are associated with a Fanconi anemia phenotype (39Montes de Oca R. Andreassen P.R. Margossian S.P. Gregory R.C. Taniguchi T. Wang X. Houghtaling S.

Synaptic activation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors on neurons of the cholinergic brainstem arousal center can increase sufficient extracellular adenosine to act on presynaptic A1 adenosine receptors (A1ADRs) of glutamate terminals, reducing release from the readily releasable pool. The time course of the adenosine response to an increase in glutamate release is slow (τ > 10 min), consistent with the role of adenosine as a fatigue factor that inhibits the activity of cholinergic arousal centers to reduce arousal."
https://openalex.org/W2003397171,"ADAP (adhesion and degranulation-promoting adaptor protein) and SKAP55 (Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein of 55 kDa) are T cell adaptors that mediate inside-out signaling from the T cell antigen receptor to integrins, giving rise to increased integrin affinity/avidity and formation of the immunological synapse between the T cell and the antigen-presenting cell. These two proteins are tightly and constitutively associated with one another, and their ability to interact is required for inside-out signaling. Here we show in an ADAP-deficient Jurkat T cell line that the co-dependence of ADAP and SKAP55 extends beyond their functional and physical interactions and show that SKAP55 protein is unstable in the absence of ADAP. Restoration of ADAP to the ADAP-deficient Jurkat T cell line restores SKAP55 expression by causing a 5-fold decrease in the rate of SKAP55 proteolysis. Inactivation of the Src homology 3 domain of SKAP55, which mediates the association between SKAP55 with ADAP, blocks the protective effect of ADAP. The half-life of SKAP55, in the absence of ADAP, is ~15–20 min, increasing to 90 min in the presence of ADAP. This is a remarkably rapid rate of turnover for a signaling protein and suggests the possibility that stimuli that signal for the stabilization of SKAP55 may play an important role in T cell adhesion and conjugate formation."

In agreement with this, the binding of VHL to endogenous HIF-α was significantly enhanced after R59949 treatment, even under hypoxic conditions. In addition, we found that R59949 could stimulate prolyl hydroxylase both at 21% O2 as well as at 1% O2. Taken together, these results reveal that R59949 is an activator of HIF prolyl hydroxylases.

Hsp40 proteins collaborate specifically with Hsp70 proteins and some other factors to participate in a wide range of cellular processes essential to cell survival, such as assisting the folding, assembly, disassembly, and translocation of newly synthesized proteins, by suppressing aggregation or mediating degradation of misfolded proteins (1Georgopoulos C.

They all contain a J domain responsible for binding to the ATPase domain and stimulating the ATPase activity of Hsp70.

This, in part, is because of a significant improvement in the ab initio methods for restoring the three-dimensional shape of a molecule from the observed one-dimensional scattering profile in a model-independent manner (20Svergun D.I.

In this communication we report, for the first time, determination of the low-resolution structure of full-length DnaJ and DnaJ (1–330) in solution using the SAXS technique with two independent ab initio shape-determination programs, DAMMIN (21Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar) and GASBOR (22Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). The results clearly indicate that the DnaJ molecule exists as a distorted ω-shaped homodimer with the C terminus of each subunit associated to form the central part of the ω, whereas the truncated DnaJ (1–330) fails to dimerize. Further, biochemical studies reveal that monomeric DnaJ (1–330) is severely deficient in peptide binding capacity and therefore lacks the autonomous chaperone activity. However, it retains the full thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity of the intact DnaJ homodimer. Proteins Expression and Purification—The expression plasmid pUHE21–2 containing the full-length E. coli DnaJ gene was generously donated by Dr. J. Buchner, Institut für Organische Chemie und Biochemie, TU München, Germany. DnaJ protein was expressed and purified according to Zylicz et al. (24Zylicz M. Yamamoto T. Mckittrick N. Sell S. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7591-7593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Tang and Wang (14Tang W. Wang C.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14985-14994Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The plasmid carrying the coding sequence for the M1-P330 fragment of DnaJ was constructed by cloning a DNA fragment with BamHI and PstI sites, amplified from the plasmid pUHE21-2, into the pBluscript II/SK(+) vector, and then subcloning into pUHE21-2 via the same restriction sites. Transformed XL1 blue cells were grown in 2 × YT medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C, and the overnight culture was diluted 100-fold and incubated for 6 h followed by induction for 4 h with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactoside. The cell pellet was suspended in buffer A (Tris buffer containing 50 mm NaCl) and sonicated. If not specified, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) was used in all experiments and is referred to as Tris buffer. The supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column equilibrated with buffer A. The flow-through out was then applied onto a Bio-Scale S5 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with 10 ml and then 15 ml of Tris buffer containing 150 and 200 mm NaCl, respectively. Examination by SDS-PAGE showed that the fractions eluted with 200 mm NaCl were DnaJ (1–330) with a molecular mass of 36 kDa. The purified DnaJ and DnaJ (1–330) were stored in elution buffer at –80 °C. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from rabbit muscle (25Liang S.J. Lin Y.Z. Zhou J.M. Tsou C.L. Wu P. Zhou Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1038: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and E. coli DsbC, a periplasmic thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase (26Chen J. Song J.L. Zhang S. Wang Y. Cui D.F. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19601-19605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by G. P. Ren and Z. Zhao, respectively, of this group. Reduced and denatured RNase A was prepared essentially according to Pigiet and Schuster (27Pigiet V.P. Schuster B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7643-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Determinations—Concentrations of DnaJ and DnaJ (1–330) were determined by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar). Concentrations of BSA, GAPDH, DsbC, and native RNase A were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm with the absorption coefficients (A1 cm0.1%) of 0.66, 0.98, 0.7, and 0.695, respectively, and at 275 nm with ϵ275 nm = 9200 m for fully reduced RNase A (27Pigiet V.P. Schuster B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7643-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Homotetrameric GAPDH and homodimeric DnaJ were considered as protomers in the calculation of molar ratios. Intrinsic and ANS fluorescence spectra were measured in a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorometer at 25 °C with 280 nm and 380 nm for excitation, respectively. CD spectra in the far-ultraviolet region (200–250 nm) were determined using a Jasco 500 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C. SAXS Measurements—Synchrotron SAXS measurements of DnaJ and DnaJ (1–330) were carried out at the beamline BL-10C of Photon Factory, Tsukuba (29Ueki T. Hiragi Y. Kataoka M. Inoko Y. Amemiya Y. Izumi Y. Tagawa H. Muroga Y. Biophys. Chem. 1985; 23: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The scattered signals were detected using a one-dimensional position-sensitive proportional counter with 512 channels. At a sample-to-detector distance of 1 m and an x-ray wavelength λ of 1.488 Å, the scattering vector q (q = 4π sinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle) ranged from 0.01 to 0.35 Å–1, which was calibrated using dried hen collagen as a standard oriented specimen. Samples were encapsulated inside a cell sandwiched by two thin parallel quartz windows 1 mm apart with a volume of 70 μl. All of the SAXS experiments were carried out in a sample holder maintained at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. SAXS data of buffer and samples were collected alternatively in the frames of 60–300 s to avoid radiation-induced protein damage. Concentrations from 2.0 to 20.0 mg/ml for DnaJ and from 3.0 to 15.0 mg/ml for DnaJ (1–330) in Tris buffer containing 200 mm NaCl were used for the measurements of interparticle interactions. The data reduction includes normalization of the one-dimensional scattered data to the intensity of the transmitted beam and subtraction of the background scattering of the buffer. All of the scattering curves were then standardized to that of a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. The low angle data were extrapolated to infinite dilution and merged with the high angle data measured at high protein concentrations to yield final scattering curves. Scattering Data Analysis—The scattering intensity I(q,c), expressed by the Guinier Equation (30Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering X-rays. John Wiley & Sons, New York1955Google Scholar), I(q,c)=I(0,c)exp(−Rg(c)2q23)(Eq. 1) is a function of scattering vector q and protein concentration c. Here I(0,c) is forward scattering intensity, and Rg(c) is apparent radius of gyration at finite concentration. At low protein concentrations, I(0,c) may be written by, Kc/I(0,c)=1/Mw+2A2c+…(Eq. 2) where Kc is a constant determined by using a series of concentrations of BSA as a reference protein with the known molecular mass of 67 kDa (31Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar). MW is the relative molecular weight of the protein and can be obtained by extrapolating Kc/I(0,c) to infinite dilution. A2 is the second virial coefficient resulting from interparticle interference effects and can discriminate between attractive and repulsive interactions. Repulsive interactions lead to positive values of A2, and attractive interactions lead to negative values. At the dilute limit, Rg(c) is given by, Rg(c)2=R02−Bifc+…(Eq. 3) where R0 is the radius of gyration at infinite dilution, and Bif is a parameter reflecting intersolute force potential (32Izumi Y. Kuwamoto S. Jinbo Y. Yoshino H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The sign of Bif means the same as that of A2 (30Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering X-rays. John Wiley & Sons, New York1955Google Scholar). The three parameters A2, R0, and Bif were calculated using Equations 2 and 3. The pair-distance distribution function, P(r), given by, P(r)=12π2∫I(q)(qr)sin(qr)dq(Eq. 4) is a measure of the frequency of interatomic vector lengths within a protein molecule and can provide further information about the shape of the scattering particle. Ab Initio Molecular Shape Determination—The overall shapes of the proteins were restored from the experimental data by two independent programs, DAMMIN (21Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar) and GASBOR (22Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Starting from a sphere with a diameter equal to the maximum particle size filled by ∼1000 densely packed small beads (dummy atoms), DAMMIN searches for the best dummy atom model through minimizing the discrepancy function, f(X) = χ2 + αP(X), between the calculated and experimental curves using the simulated annealing method. αP(X) is a looseness penalty with positive weight for α > 0, and χ is the discrepancy between the experimental Iexp(qj) and the calculated Icalc(qj) curves χ2=1N−1∑j[Iexp(qj)−cIcalc(qj)σ(qj)]2(Eq. 5) where N is the number of experimental points, c is a scaling factor, and σ(qj) is the experimental error at the momentum transfer qj. The method is to modify the coordinates of beads randomly, while always approaching the configurations that decrease the energy f(X). Starting from a random string, simulated annealing was employed to find a compact configuration of beads minimizing the discrepancy. In this method, a constant was subtracted from the experimental data to ensure that the intensity decay follows Porod's law for homogeneous particles. The x-ray scattering curves at high angles (q > 0.25 Å–1) contain a significant contribution from the internal particle structure. GASBOR is a more versatile ab initio approach, especially for high scattering vectors. A dummy residues model was generated by a random walk Cα chain and was folded to minimize the discrepancy between the calculated and the experimental scattering data. GASBOR uses a simulated annealing approach to find a chain-compatible spatial distribution of an exact number of dummy residues, which correspond to the Cα atoms of amino acid residues. The dummy residues method permits fitting data up to a resolution of 5 Å, if the number of amino acid residues of the protein is specified. Activity Assay—Thiol-disulfide reductase activity was assayed by measuring the turbidity increase at 650 nm because of insulin reduction (33Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was expressed as a ratio of the slope of the linear part of the turbidity curve to the lag time (34Martínez-Galisteo E. Padilla C.A. Garcia-Alfonso C. López-Barea J. Barcena J.A. Biochimie. (Paris). 1993; 75: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Oxidase activity was assayed by the oxidative reactivation of reduced and denatured RNase A (27Pigiet V.P. Schuster B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7643-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Aggregation during the refolding of fully denatured GAPDH upon dilution in the presence of DnaJ or DnaJ (1–330) was followed by light scattering according to Tang and Wang (14Tang W. Wang C.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14985-14994Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to measure the chaperone activity of the proteins. SAXS Parameters—As shown in Fig. 1 the Guinier plots of experimental SAXS data at all concentrations used were linear in the low q region, indicating that the proteins do not undergo aggregation. The function of Kc/I(0,c) evaluated from the intercepts of the Guinier plots is linear over the entire concentration range (Fig. 2A), and the slope represents the value of A2. The square of apparent radius of gyration Rg(c) calculated from the slopes of the Guinier plots, as a function of protein concentration, also showed a linear relation (Fig. 2B), and the slope represents the value of Bif (30Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering X-rays. John Wiley & Sons, New York1955Google Scholar). The SAXS parameters are summarized in Table I. The molecular mass of DnaJ, 94.7 kDa, is about twice the value 45.4 kDa for DnaJ (1–330). The values of A2 and Bif of DnaJ and DnaJ (1–330) are all negative, and the negative value of DnaJ (1–330) is ∼2–3-fold larger than that for DnaJ, indicating even stronger attractive interactions between the DnaJ (1–330) molecules. The radius of gyration of DnaJ, 62.1 ± 0.3 Å, is greater than the value 39.2 ± 0.3 Å for DnaJ (1–330).Table IStructural parameters of DnaJ and DnaJ (1–330) determined by SAXS experiments in solutionRg(0)aRadius of gyration at infinite dilution given by the Guinier approximation.RgbRadius of gyration at infinite dilution estimated using the GNOM package.MWcMolecular mass calculated from forward scattering intensities (Fig. 2A).A2dSecond virial coefficient calculated from Fig. 2A using Equation 2.BifeInterparticle interference coefficient calculated from Fig. 2B using Equation 3.ÅÅkDa10-4 ml mol g-210-13 cm5 g-1DnaJ62.1 ± 0.361.5 ± 0.394.7 ± 3.0-0.63 ± 0.2-23.5 ± 1.7DnaJ (1-330)39.2 ± 0.340.3 ± 0.345.4 ± 1.8-1.8 ± 0.3-46.5 ± 2.2a Radius of gyration at infinite dilution given by the Guinier approximation.b Radius of gyration at infinite dilution estimated using the GNOM package.c Molecular mass calculated from forward scattering intensities (Fig. 2A).d Second virial coefficient calculated from Fig. 2A using Equation 2.e Interparticle interference coefficient calculated from Fig. 2B using Equation 3. Open table in a new tab The pair-distance distribution function P(r) (Fig. 3) was obtained from the entire scattering curve I(q) in the range of q, from zero to qmax, by direct Fourier transformation (Equation 4). In the low angle region (q < 0.05 Å–1), I(q) was extended to zero by using the radius of gyration at infinite dilution, i.e. Rg (0) (Table I). In the high angle region (q > 0.05 Å–1), concentrated solutions were used to improve the statistics, as the scattering intensity is not affected by interparticle interactions. The maximum linear dimension, Dmax, determined from P(r) (Fig. 3) is 170 ± 5 Å for DnaJ and 120 ± 5 Å for DnaJ (1–330). The radius of gyration of DnaJ and DnaJ (1–330), estimated from the P(r) function by applying GNOM to the entire scattering profile in the range of 0.01 Å–1 to qmax, is 61.5 ± 0.3 Å and 40.3 ± 0.3 Å, respectively, which is consistent with the corresponding value estimated from the extrapolated Guinier plots. The P(r) functions calculated from the three-dimensional coordinates (PDB code 1BQ0) of the DnaJ sequence (1–77) (the J domain) and (PDB code 1EXK) of the sequence (131–209) (the zinc finger domain) using CRYSOL and GNOM were used to compare with those of DnaJ and DnaJ (1–330) (Fig. 3). The main peak at 47 Å and the Dmax of 120 Å for DnaJ (1–330) are both much larger than the corresponding values of 15 Å and 42 Å for the sequence 1–77 and 14 Å and 51 Å for the 131–209, respectively. The sum of the Dmax values for the sequences of 1–77 and 131–209, 93 Å, is smaller than the value of 120 Å obtained for DnaJ (1–330). This suggests that the two sequences and the fragment (210–330) are arranged to form an elongated DnaJ (1–330) molecule. DnaJ showed a spread P(r) profile with the main peak at 75 Å and a Dmax of 170 Å, which is, however, much smaller than twice the Dmax of DnaJ (1–330), indicating that the two DnaJ (1–330) subunits are not arranged linearly. Ab Initio Molecular Shape—Dummy atom modeling was performed from the scattering pattern up to qmax = 0.25 Å–1 using DAMMIN within a spherical search diameter of Dmax = 120 Å for DnaJ (1–330) and 170 Å for DnaJ without symmetrical constraint. The uniqueness and the stability of the restored shapes were checked by repeating modeling. A dozen independent models were then aligned and averaged using programs SUPCOMB (35Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) and DAMAVER (36Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1596) Google Scholar), which superimposed all models and determined the common envelope containing all models. In the next round, this common envelope was used as an initial search volume for all new models. Twelve runs of ab initio shape determination produced consistent results, as all output models yielded nearly identical scattering patterns (Fig. 4, dashed curves) with a discrepancy of χ = 1.3 for DnaJ (1–330) and χ = 1.1 for DnaJ to the respective corrected experimental data obtained by subtracting a constant in the scattering range up to 0.25 Å–1. These final models were again aligned and averaged using SUPCOMB (35Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) and DAMAVER (36Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The averaged dummy atom model of DnaJ at three orthogonal orientations (Fig. 5, left column) shows a molecule basically with a 2-fold symmetry along the middle line of the front view.Fig. 5Restored models of DnaJ.A, front view; B, side view; C, top view. Left column, the averaged model by DAMMIN using a qmax of 0.25 Å–1 with no symmetrical constraint. Right column, the most probable model (dummy residues) by GASBOR using a qmax of 0.35 Å–1 with a P2 symmetry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The restored dummy residues models were obtained by performing 12 runs with the GASBOR program using 752 dummy residues assuming no molecular symmetry and fitting the scattering profiles up to qmax = 0.35 Å–1, i.e. with a resolution of 2π /qmax = 18 Å. The results are similar to those obtained by DAMMIN (data not shown). The models restored by both DAMMIN and GASBOR exhibit 2-fold symmetry. A 2-fold (P2) symmetrical constraint in GASBOR was employed using all 376 residues for one DnaJ monomer to obtain more reliable models. The final models fit the experimental data very well with a discrepancy of χ = 1.3 in the entire scattering range as indicated by the solid curves in Fig. 4. DAMSEL in the package of DAMAVER was employed to align all of the possible pairs of models and to identify the most probable model, which should yield the smallest average discrepancy (Fig. 5, right column). The results suggest that DnaJ exhibits an ω-shape. Using the same approach described above, DnaJ (1–330) was restored to appear as an elongated roughly S-shaped molecule composed of three regions (Fig. 6, left column). The NMR structures of fragments 1–77 and 131–209 were accommodated well within the envelope of the restored model of DnaJ (1–330). The NMR structure of the zinc finger domain (fragment 131–209) was superimposed with the restored DnaJ (1–330) model next to the J domain. The zinc finger domain is composed of two zinc fingers in an abnormal topology (17Martinez-Yamout M. Legge G.B. Zhang O. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 805-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It has been reported that zinc finger 1 is necessary for the autonomous chaperone activity in cooperation with the C-terminal domain (5Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J.

To investigate the expression of functional oversulfated DS structures in the brain, a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb), 2A12, was generated against DS (An-DS) from ascidian Ascidia nigra, which contains a unique iD disaccharide unit, iduronic acid (2-O-sulfate)α1→3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate), as a predominant disaccharide. mAb 2A12 specifically reacted with the immunogen, and recognized iD-enriched decasaccharides as minimal structures. The 2A12 epitope was specifically observed in the hippocampus and cerebellum of the mouse brain on postnatal day 7, and the expression in the cerebellum disappeared in the adult brain, suggesting a spatiotemporally regulated expression of this epitope. Embryonic hippocampal neurons were immunopositive for 2A12, and the addition of the antibody to the culture medium significantly reduced the neurite growth of hippocampal neurons. In addition, two minimum 2A12-reactive decasaccharide sequences with multiple consecutive iD units were isolated from the An-DS chains, which exhibited stronger inhibitory activity against the binding of various growth factors and neurotrophic factors to immobilized embryonic pig brain CS/DS chains (E-CS/DS) than the intact E-CS/DS, suggesting that the 2A12 epitope at the neuronal surface acts as a receptor or co-receptor for these molecules. Thus, we have selected a unique antibody that recognizes iD-enriched oversulfated DS structures, which are implicated in the development of the hippocampus and cerebellum in the central nervous system.

These disaccharide units are modified during chain elongation by specific sulfotransferases at C-2 of GlcUA/IdoUA and/or C-4 and/or C-6 of GalNAc in various combinations, thereby producing characteristic sulfation patterns and enormous structural diversity for CS, DS, and CS/DS hybrid chains. Recent studies have shown that the GlcUA/IdoUA ratio and sulfation pattern of the brain CS/DS change during development (10Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Tone Y. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

For example, embryonic pig brain-derived CS/DS (E-CS/DS) chains contain 1.7% D and/or iD units and 0.9% E units (GlcUA-GalNAc(4S,6S)) (11Bao X. Nishimura S. Mikami T. Yamada S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J.

We recently demonstrated that these rare oversulfated disaccharides, in addition to IdoUA-containing disaccharides, are critical structural elements for the neuritogenic activity of E-CS/DS (11Bao X.

However, the presence of oversulfated DS structures in the mammalian brain has not been rigorously characterized or explored. The DS chains from the body of ascidian Ascidia nigra (An-DS) consist of a major (∼80%) iD unit (IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S)) in addition to a minor (∼20%) iC unit (IdoUA-GalNAc(6S)), where 2S represents 2-O-sulfate (22Pavão M.S.

The iD unit-containing structure is unique, and has not been detected in mammalian tissues. However, An-DS binds various growth factors including hepatocyte growth factor (23Catlow K. Deakin J.A.

Sugahara, unpublished results. and promotes neurite outgrowth toward hippocampal neurons in vitro (18Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavão M.S. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43744-43754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), implying biological functions for the iD-containing DS structures. CS/DS hybrid chains isolated from shark skin also exhibited marked binding activity toward various growth factors including those described above and also strong neuritogenic activity, and contain small yet significant proportions of various disulfated disaccharide units including D or iD units (19Nandini C.D. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4058-4069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To study the structure-function relationship of CS/DS chains and possible biological functions of iD-containing structures during the development of the brain, we generated a new monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2A12 against An-DS in the present study. Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry using mAb 2A12 were performed, and two minimal decasaccharides recognized by this antibody were isolated. Interestingly, mAb 2A12 inhibited neurite growth, and the two decasaccharides inhibited the binding of several growth factors and neurotrophic factors to E-CS/DS. These results indicate that iD-containing DS structures are present in the hippocampus and cerebellum of the mammalian brain, and appear to play specific roles in the development of the central nervous system.

Alkaline phosphate-linked goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rat IgMs were purchased from Chemicon and StressGen Biotechnol Corp. (San Diego, CA), respectively. Alexa Fluro 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) and Alexa Fluro 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (μ chain) were obtained from Molecular Probes. HS and heparin from bovine intestinal mucosa, poly-dl-ornithine (P-ORN), and anti-neurofilaments (NF) were purchased from Sigma, and anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) was from Leico Technologies Inc. (St. Louis, MO). A Vectastain ABC kit was obtained from Vector Laboratories. All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest quality available. Preparation of An-DS—The isolation of GAGs from A. nigra was carried out as described by Pavão et al. (22Pavão M.S. Mourão P.A. Mulloy B. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31027-31036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the lyophilized body (100 g) of A. nigra was treated with actinase E, and sulfated GAGs were recovered with a yield of 0.5% by precipitation with cetylpyridinium chloride. The GAG mixture was treated with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 to remove HS, and the resistant polymers were subjected to anion-exchange chromatography with an Acell QMA Plus cartridge, which was pre-equilibrated with 0.5 m NaCl-containing 0.3 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, using a stepwise elution with phosphate buffers containing 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 m NaCl. A portion (60 mg) of the 1.5 m NaCl-eluted fraction (144 mg) was re-chromatographed under the same conditions, yielding 50.4 mg in the corresponding fraction. This sample contained 2.4% peptides but no detectable amounts of HS or hyaluronate as evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, and was used for immunization of the mice. For the screening of antibodies and structural and functional analyses, the DS-peptide fraction was further purified by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography to remove free peptides. The water-eluted DS-peptide fraction from the C-18 column was designated An-DS, which was completely digested with chondroitinase ABC, confirming the purity. Cellulose Acetate Membrane Electrophoresis—An-DS (2 μg each) was incubated with chondroitinase ABC (10 mIU), AC-I (4 mIU), or B (4 mIU) in an appropriate buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. Each digest was spotted on a cellulose acetate membrane, and subjected to electrophoresis at a constant voltage of 100 V for 30 min. The membrane was thereafter stained with Alcian blue (0.1% in 0.1% acetic acid) for 10 min and then destained with 0.1% acetic acid for 20 min. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—If not specified, all the steps were performed at room temperature. For antibody screening and the evaluation of substrate specificity, streptavidin-coated plates were used. The reactivity of antibodies with various GAG subtypes was tested using ELISA as described previously (15Bao X. Mikami T. Yamada S. Faissner A. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9180-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, various GAG preparations were individually biotinylated and immobilized on the plates. Wells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and incubated with hybridoma supernatants or ascitic fluid containing antibodies followed by alkaline phosphatase-linked goat anti-mouse Ig(G+M) or IgM. The secondary antibody was detected using p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and the absorbance was measured at 415 nm. Negative controls received no An-DS and/or primary antibody. When mAb 473HD and commercial anti-CS mAbs, CS-56 and MO-556, were used as primary antibodies, a 50-fold dilution was employed. For the inhibitory ELISA, a certain amount (0.5 μg) of GAGs or the oligosaccharide fractions generated by digestion with chondroitinase ABC (see below) was incubated with mAb 2A12 (as ascitic fluid, diluted 400-fold) in a volume of 50 μl at room temperature for 1 h before being applied to the plate. The inhibition was calculated from the reduced absorbance relative to that obtained from a control incubation without GAG. To characterize the 2A12 epitopes in An-DS, which contains a disaccharide repeating region and an oligosaccharide-peptide linkage region, the purified An-DS (12 μg) was incubated with chondroitinase ABC (10 mIU), chondroitinase B (4 mIU), or a mixture of chondroitinases AC-I (4 mIU) and AC-II (4 mIU) in their appropriate buffers at 37 °C for 2 h. Incubation with heat-inactivated chondroitinase ABC was run as a control. The digests were added to a Maxisorp plate in a 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.2. After incubation at 4 °C for 16 h, the plate was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by the steps described above. Absorbance was recorded 2 h after the addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Preparation and Selection of Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies were raised by immunizing BALB/cA Jol mice using the DS-peptide preparation obtained from A. nigra. Briefly, the immunogen was injected subcutaneously into the back of mice at a dose of 200 μg/injection every 2 weeks, and after the third injection the serum was screened against highly purified An-DS using ELISA. Spleen B lymphocytes of the positive mice after the fifth injection were isolated and fused with myeloma cells. The fused hybridoma cells were cultured, and the culture supernatant was screened by ELISA using biotinylated An-DS as antigen. Four positive clones (2A12, 3G11, 4B5, and 5F4) were selected. Each clone was injected intraperitoneally into mice to obtain ascitic fluid, which was used for evaluating substrate specificity. Among the antibodies selected, mAb 2A12 is of particular interest because of its high specificity and unique staining pattern in the mouse brain (see below). An aliquot of 2A12 was purified using a mouse IgM purification kit according to the manufacturer's directions. The purified antibody was quantified with a BCA protein assay kit and used for assaying the inhibition of the neurite growth of cultured embryonic hippocampal neurons (see below). Immunohistochemistry—P7 and adult ddY mice were anesthesized, and the brains were dissected, immediately frozen with dry ice, and kept at -80 °C. Within 2–4 days of the dissection, the frozen brains were cut into sections 12 μm thick, dehydrated by heating at 60 °C for 1 h, and stored at -80 °C for use. For immunostaining with the antibodies, the brain sections were fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1) and rehydrated with distilled water. The sections were then treated sequentially with the following solutions: 1) 2.5% hydrogen peroxide in PBS (10 mm, pH, 7.4) for 30 min; 2) 1% BSA, 4% normal goat serum in PBS for 60 min; 3) primary antibody in 1% BSA/PBS (diluted 200-fold for 2A12 and 100-fold for CS-56) at 4 °C overnight; 4) biotinylated anti-mouse IgM (μ chain) (8 ng/ml) in 1% BSA/PBS for 60 min; 5) Vectastain ABC solution in PBS (200-fold) for 60 min; and 6) 0.06% diaminobenzidine, 0.01% hydrogen peroxide in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm, pH, 7.6). Finally, sections were fixed with a series of ethanol solutions and mounted with a xylene-based mounting medium. As a control, mouse IgM was used as a primary antibody. To confirm the specificity of the staining with the antibodies, brain sections were pretreated with chondroitinase ABC protease-free (2 mIU/section) to remove CS and DS, and then processed for immunostaining as described above. Cell Culture—Hippocampal cells were cultured using embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) or 16.5 (E16.5) mouse brains as described previously (13Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Schutte K. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 18Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavão M.S. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43744-43754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The hippocampi were obtained by microdissection and dissociated with a brief trypsin treatment. Dissociated cells were suspended in Eagle's modified essential medium containing an N2 supplement, seeded on P-ORN-coated coverslips, and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Immunocytochemistry—E15.5 mouse hippocampal cells were cultured for 48 h, washed once with PBS, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Fixed cells were rinsed with PBS three times and blocked with 1% BSA, 4% goat normal serum in PBS. Cells were then incubated with mAb 2A12 (200-fold) in 1% BSA/PBS for 2 h, washed with PBS three times, permeated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min, and incubated with anti-MAP2 (200-fold) and anti-NF (200-fold) in 1% BSA/PBS at 4 °C overnight. After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (200-fold) and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (200-fold) in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h. The cells were washed with PBS three times, mounted, and observed using an Olympus confocal microscope. The procedure was carried out at room temperature if not specified otherwise. Neurite Growth Assay—Neurite growth of hippocampal neurons from E16.5 mouse brains was assayed as described (13Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Schutte K. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 18Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavão M.S. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43744-43754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Dissociated hippocampal cells were seeded on coverslips precoated with P-ORN at 10,000, 25,000, or 50,000 cells/cm2, and cultured for 2 h. After the pre-culture, the purified mAb 2A12 (10–200 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium. Mouse IgM was run as a control. After a 60-h culture, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then immunostained with anti-MAP2 and anti-NF, and detection was carried out with a Vectastain ABC kit using diaminobenzidine as a chromagen as described above. Neurite growth was evaluated by determining the percentage of neurons bearing at least one neurite and the total length of neurites per cell. Neurites longer than the cell body were chosen for counting. About 300 isolated cells were randomly chosen for calculating the percentage, and 100 cells for measuring neurite length, per coverslip. This assay was performed three times in triplicate, and the results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. The significance of the difference between means was evaluated with the Student's t test. Delayed Extraction Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)—Dried oligosaccharides (5–10 pmol of purified decasaccharides, and 30 pmol of an oligosaccharide mixture) was first mixed with 1–2 μl of (Arg-Gly)15 (10 pmol) and then 1 μl of gentisic acid (1 mg/ml) (24Rhomberg A.J. Biemann K. Jackson P. Gallagher J.T. A Laboratory Guide to Glycoconjugate Analysis: Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Highly Acidic Polysaccharides. Birkhuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 77-89Crossref Google Scholar). Each mixture was spotted on a plate for MS analysis using a mixture of (Arg-Gly)15 and gentisic acid as a control. The analysis was run in a positive mode using the HCD1001 method according to the manufacturer's instructions. The MS spectra were recorded on a Voyager DE-RP-Pro (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using the linear mode. Fragmentation of An-DS—An-DS (2 mg) was incubated with protease-free chondroitinase ABC (25 mIU) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 60 mm sodium acetate in a volume of 100 μl at 37 °C for 32 min (25Saito H. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1536-1542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After boiling at 100 °C for 1 min, the digests were filtered and subjected to gel filtration on a column of Superdex Peptide (10 × 300 mm) using 0.2 m NH4HCO3 as an eluent at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Each peak was collected, re-chromatographed under the same conditions, desalted by repeated evaporation, and quantified by the carbozole reaction (26Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). Size determination of each fraction was achieved by MS analysis as described above. Fractionation of Decasaccharides and Analysis of Disaccharide Composition by Anion-exchange Chromatography—Separation of the decasaccharide fraction and the analysis of disaccharide composition were carried out by HPLC with an amine-bound silica PA-03 column (YMC Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) using a linear gradient of NaH2PO4 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min as described for the separation of CS-D octasaccharides (16Nadanaka S.

Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), respectively. The identification and quantification of the unsaturated disaccharides generated by bacterial chondroitinases were carried out by making comparisons with authentic unsaturated disaccharides in the CS and DS chains: Δ4,5-HexUAα1–3GalNAc (ΔO unit) generated from GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc (O unit), Δ4,5-HexUAα1–3GalNAc(6S) (ΔC unit) from GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(6S) (C unit) or IdoUAα1–3GalNAc(6S) (iC unit), Δ4,5-HexUAα1–3GalNAc(4S) (ΔA unit) from GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4S) (A unit) or IdoUAα1–3GalNAc(4S) (iA unit), Δ4,5-HexUA(2S)α1–3GalNAc(6S) (ΔD unit) from GlcUA(2S)β1–3GalNAc(6S) (D unit) or IdoUA(2S)α1–3GalNAc(6S) (iD unit), Δ4,5-HexUA(2S)α1–3GalNAc(4S) (ΔB unit) from GlcUA(2S)β1–3GalNAc(4S) (B unit) or IdoUA(2S)α1–3GalNAc(4S) (iB unit), Δ4,5-HexUAα1–3GalNAc(4S,6S) (ΔE unit) from GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S) (E unit) or IdoUAα1–3GalNAc(4S,6S) (iE unit), and Δ4,5-HexUA(2S)α1–3GalNAc(4S,6S) (ΔT unit) from GlcUA(2S)β1–3GalNAc(4S,6S) (T unit) or IdoUA(2S)α1–3GalNAc(4S,6S) (iT unit) (3Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Enzymatic Treatments—For the analysis of disaccharide composition, poly- or oligosaccharides (100–500 pmol as disaccharides) were incubated with 5 mIU of chondroitinase ABC at 37 °C for 2 h. The digests were derivatized with 2AB, and excess 2AB was removed by extraction with CHCl3 (28Kawashima H. Atarashi K. Hirose M. Hirose J. Yamada S. Sugahara K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol.

For examination of the digestibility of the decasaccharides isolated from An-DS (An-DS 10-a and 10-b) with various chondroitinases, each decasaccharide (50 pmol) was incubated with chondroitinase ABC (1 mIU), chondroitinase B (1 mIU), or a mixture of chondroitinases AC-I (0.5 mIU) and AC-II (0.5 mIU) at 37 °C for 1 h, respectively. To identify tetrasaccharide structures at the reducing ends of the purified decasaccharides, each 2AB-labeled decasaccharide (∼10 pmol) was incubated with chondroitinase ABC (1 mIU"
https://openalex.org/W2077016308,"The fatty acid ω-hydroxylation regiospecificity of CYP4 enzymes may result from presentation of the terminal carbon to the oxidizing species via a narrow channel that restricts access to the other carbon atoms. To test this hypothesis, the oxidation of 12-iodo-, 12-bromo-, and 12-chlorododecanoic acids by recombinant CYP4A1 has been examined. Although all three 12-halododecanoic acids bind to CYP4A1 with similar dissociation constants, the 12-chloro and 12-bromo fatty acids are oxidized to 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid and 12-oxododecanoic acid, whereas the 12-iodo analogue is very poorly oxidized. Incubations in H2182O show that the 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid oxygen derives from water, whereas that in the aldehyde derives from O2. The alcohol thus arises from oxidation of the halide to an oxohalonium species that is hydrolyzed by water, whereas the aldehyde arises by a conventional carbon hydroxylation-elimination mechanism. No irreversible inactivation of CYP4A1 is observed during 12-halododecanoic acid oxidation. Control experiments show that CYP2E1, which has an ω-1 regiospecificity, primarily oxidizes 12-halododecanoic acids to the ω-aldehyde rather than alcohol product. Incubation of CYP4A1 with 12,12-[2H]2-12-chlorododecanoic acid causes a 2–3-fold increase in halogen versus carbon oxidation. The fact that the order of substrate oxidation (Br > Cl » I) approximates the inverse of the intrinsic oxidizability of the halogen atoms is consistent with presentation of the halide terminus via a channel that accommodates the chloride and bromide but not iodide atoms, which implies an effective channel diameter greater than 3.90 Å but smaller than 4.30 Å.

No irreversible inactivation of CYP4A1 is observed during 12-halododecanoic acid oxidation. Control experiments show that CYP2E1, which has an ω-1 regiospecificity, primarily oxidizes 12-halododecanoic acids to the ω-aldehyde rather than alcohol product. Incubation of CYP4A1 with 12,12-[2H]2-12-chlorododecanoic acid causes a 2–3-fold increase in halogen versus carbon oxidation. The fact that the order of substrate oxidation (Br > Cl » I) approximates the inverse of the intrinsic oxidizability of the halogen atoms is consistent with presentation of the halide terminus via a channel that accommodates the chloride and bromide but not iodide atoms, which implies an effective channel diameter greater than 3.90 Å but smaller than 4.30 Å. Fatty acids are readily oxidized by cytochrome P450 enzymes in an isoform-specific manner to hydroxy fatty acids and, in the case of unsaturated fatty acids, also to epoxides (1Capdevila J.H. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Plenum Klewer, New York2005: 531-551Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 2Zeldin D.C. J. Biol.

The hydroxylation of fatty acids in general contributes to fatty acid homeostasis, but the oxidation of arachidonic acid gives rise to products that have specific functions in signaling pathways. For example, the ω-hydroxylated product, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), 1The abbreviations used are: HETE, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid; heme, iron protoporphyrin IX; CYP, cytochrome P450; DLPC, dilauroylphosphatidylcholine; TMS, trimethylsilyl; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. is a vasoconstrictor (4Imig J.D.

Harder D.R. Roman R.J. Circ.

Chem. 2001; 276: 36059-36062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 5Ma Y.H. Gebremedhin M.L. Schwartzman M.L. Falck J.R. Clark J.E. Masters B.S. Harder D.R. Roman R.J.

Commun. 1988; 152: 1269-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The regiochemistry of oxidation of fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid, is therefore of critical physiological importance. The oxidation of fatty acids at internal sites along the fatty acid hydrocarbon chain is mediated by a variety of cytochrome P450 enzymes. The ω-1 position on the carbon adjacent to the terminal carbon of the hydrocarbon chain is the usual primary default position for the oxidation of fatty acids by P450 enzymes not specifically evolved as fatty acid hydroxylases (7CaJacob C.A. Chan W. Shephard E. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18640-18649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Alterman M.A. Hanzlik R.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Hydroxylation of the terminal (ω) carbon does not occur, or is a very minor product, with such P450 enzymes. This specificity reflects the fact that the ω-1 position is intrinsically more reactive than the terminal (ω) position because a secondary C-H bond is several Kcal weaker than a primary C-H bond, and thus is more susceptible to oxidation by P450 enzymes (9Korzekwa K.R. Jones J.P. Gillette J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 7042-7046Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10De Visser S.P. Kumar D. Cohen S. Shacham R. Shaik S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8362-8363Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in steric terms, the ω-1 carbon is only second to the terminal carbon in steric accessibility. The ω-hydroxylation of fatty acids is therefore a difficult reaction that must be actively promoted by the active site structure. The CYP4 family of P450 enzymes is unique in that it preferentially catalyzes the ω-hydroxylation of fatty acids. These enzymes therefore reflect the evolution of a strategy that predominantly directs the reaction to the terminal carbon. We have previously postulated that this strategy involves a constricted access channel to the ferryl species that disfavors presentation of any atom other than the terminal methyl for oxidation (7CaJacob C.A. Chan W. Shephard E. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18640-18649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that (a) different chain length fatty acids are preferentially oxidized at the ω terminus, ruling out mechanisms that involve sensing the distance of the ω-carbon from the carboxyl group (11Hoch U. Zhang Z. Kroetz D.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); (b) the oxidation of terminal triple bonds inactivates the CYP4 enzymes via a reaction that involves addition of the ferryl oxygen to the terminal carbon of the triple bond, yielding a ketene, rather than to the internal carbon, which would result in heme alkylation (7CaJacob C.A. Chan W. Shephard E. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18640-18649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chan W.K. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); and (c) placement of bulky substituents, such as a phenyl group, at the fatty acid terminus suppresses oxidation of the substrate (13Bambal R.B. Hanzlik R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition to hydrocarbon hydroxylation, P450 enzymes catalyze a diversity of other reactions, including the oxidation of heteroatoms to zwitterionic products: e.g. of trialkyl amines to trialkyl amine oxides and dialkylsulfides to dialkylsulfoxides (14Ortiz de Montellano P.R. De Voss J.J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2005: 183-245Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, P450 enzymes are powerful oxidative catalysts and evidence exists that they can oxidize not only nitrogen and sulfur functions but also the halogen atom in aryland alkyliodides, bromides, and possibly even chlorides. Conclusive evidence for oxidation of a halide atom is only available for aryliodides. It has been demonstrated that the P450-catalyzed, iodosobenzene-dependent oxidation of labeled iodobenzene results in the formation of labeled iodosobenzene (15Burka L.T. Thorsen A. Guengerich F.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 7615-7616Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Using a substrate that stabilizes the iodoso structure, Guengerich (16Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17198-17205Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) has, furthermore, directly demonstrated formation of the iodoso derivative in a normal P450-catalyzed reaction. The evidence for bromide and chloride oxidation is less direct. The oxidation of 1,2-dichloroethane and propyl halides by liver microsomes produced a range of products, including compounds whose formation is compatible with (but does not require) a mechanism involving oxidation of the halide atom (17Guengerich F.P. Crawford W.M. Domoradzki J.Y. Macdonald T.L. Watanabe P.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1980; 55: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Tachizawa H. MacDonald T.L. Neal R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 22: 745-751PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of a metabolite in the oxidation of CCl4 that reacts as an electrophilic chloride atom has also been postulated from the formation of a p-chlorophenol in the presence of a phenol trap (19Mico B.A. Branchflower R.V. Pohl L.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1983; 32: 2357-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We report here preparation of the 12-iodo-, 12-bromo-, and 12-chlorododecanoic acids and analysis of their oxidation by recombinant CYP4A1, a rat enzyme that highly favors ω-hydroxylation of dodecanoic (lauric) acid. The hypothesis behind this study is that the halogen atom becomes the “ω” position in these substrates, and therefore its oxidation, if possible, should be enforced by the same active site features that promote ω-hydroxylation of dodecanoic acid. The results have provided important insights into the mechanism used by the CYP4 family of enzymes to favor ω- over ω-1 hydroxylation of fatty acids. Materials—Ampicillin, δ-aminolevulinic acid, glycerol, lysozyme, DLPC, glutathione, catalase, NADPH, and dodecanoic acid were from Sigma. 11-Dodecenoic acid was from NuChek Prep (Elysian, MN), and Tris from Fisher Scientific. [1-14C]Dodecanoic acid (55 mCi/mmol, 18 mm) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis. MO). CYP4A1 was expressed and purified as previously reported (20Dierks E.A. Davis S.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Human CYP2E1 (+ P450 reductase + cytochrome b5 Supersomes™) and control insect cell membranes were purchased from Gentest-BD Biosciences. The human NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase cDNA was provided by Stephen M. Black and the protein was expressed and purified as previously described (20Dierks E.A. Davis S.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Purified rat liver cytochrome b5 was a gift from Lester Bornheim (University of California, San Francisco). Human liver cytochrome b5 was purchased from Promega (Fitchburg, WI). Preparation of Probes—12-Iodododecanoic acid (3) was synthesized from 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid using the procedure of Apparu et al. (21Apparu M. Comet M. Leo P.M. Mathieu J-P. Du Moulinet d'Hardemare A. Pasqualini R. Vidal M. Bull. Soc. Chim.

Berichte. 1981; 114: 2245-2260Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). 12,12-[2H]2-12-Chlorododecanoic acid (7) was synthesized from 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid in four steps beginning with esterification of the free acid with diazomethane and protection of the alcohol as the t-butyldimethylsilyl ether (90% yield over two steps). Reduction of the ester with lithium aluminum deuteride (89% yield) was followed by chlorination of the alcohol with triphenylphosphine/carbon tetrachloride (79% yield). Acidic cleavage of the silyl ether was followed by oxidation to the carboxylic acid 7 using 8 n Jones' Reagent. Purification by flash chromatography (silica gel, 10% ethyl acetate in hexanes, 0.5% acetic acid) afforded 7 (60% yield) as a white solid (m.p. 38.0–39.0 °C). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3), δ 1.20–1.45 (14H, m), 1.59 (2H, quint, J1 = 7.5 Hz), 1.71 (2H, quint, J1 = 7.5 Hz), 2.31 (2H, t, J1 = 7.5 Hz), 3.50 (0.04H, residual CH2Cl, t, J1 = 7.2 Hz), 9.80 (1H, br s). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3), δ 24.6, 26.8, 28.8, 29.0, 29.1, 29.30, 29.35, 29.38, 32.4, 34.0, 44.4 (quint, 1JC-D 22.8 Hz), 180.5.

Suggs W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1975; 31: 2647-2650Crossref Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). A suspension of 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid (1.07 g, 5 mmol) in 12 ml of CH2Cl2 was combined with pyridinium chlorochromate (1.63 g, 7.5 mmol) in 10 ml of CH2Cl2 and the resulting mixture was stirred under nitrogen at ∼25 °C for 2 h. Diethyl ether (100 ml) was then added and the black reaction mixture was filtered. The filtered ether fraction was passed through Florisil, the ether was removed under vacuum at a rotary evaporator, and the residue was purified by silica gel flash chromatography. The GC-MS of the trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivative of aldehyde 4 had a retention time of 10.40 min and a molecular ion at m/z 286. Spectroscopic Methods—Reduced CO-difference spectra and spectroscopic substrate binding studies were performed on a Varian Cary 1E UV-visible dual-beam spectrophotometer. Absolute spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard 8452 diode array spectrophotometer. Both instruments were equipped with temperature control accessories. The cytochrome P450 content was determined by the method of Omura and Sato (29Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain substrate binding difference spectra, the probes dissolved in methanol were titrated into the CYP4A (0.5 μm) solution using a 10-μl Hamilton syringe, resulting in a final sample volume change of less than 2% and introduction of less than 2% methanol into the solution. All spectra were obtained at 25 °C. The spectral binding constant Ks was determined from the hyperbolic plot of the respective differences between the absorbance at 417 and 390 nm versus the ligand concentration. Measurement of CYP4A1 Hydroxylation Activity—CYP4A1 ω- and ω-1 hydroxylation was measured by mixing the stock phosphate buffer solutions of 10 μg of DLPC, 3.12–15 pmol of CYP4A1, 31.25–250 pmol of cytochrome P450 reductase, 3.13–25 pmol of cytochrome b5, and 5 μg of catalase. This mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature before 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 250 mm NaCl and 10% glycerol was added to a final volume of 490 μl. Finally, 5 μl of a 10 mm solution of [1-14C]dodecanoic acid (final concentration 100 μm) was added. The reaction was started after an additional incubation time of 2 min at 37 °C by addition of 10 μl of 100 mm NADPH. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (50 μl) were removed at time periods between 0 and 10 min and were quenched by adding 100 μl of ice-cold 94:6 acetonitrile:acetic acid (v/v). The precipitated proteins were pelleted out by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 2 min and the samples were analyzed by HPLC coupled to a flow scintillation analyzer. HPLC Dodecanoic Acid Hydroxylation Assay—The hydroxydodecanoic acids were separated from dodecanoic acid on a C18 Alltech Econosil column (3.2 × 150 mm) operated isocratically with a 90:10 mixture of acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid):water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The HPLC system was coupled to a Packard Radiomatic Flow-One model A500 radioisotope detector. Under these conditions, the hydroxydodecanoic acids eluted at 3.3 min, whereas dodecanoic acid eluted at 4.6 min. Assay for Inactivation of CYP4A1—A two-stage procedure was used to evaluate time-dependent inactivation of CYP4A1 in the presence of 12-halododecanoic acids. In the first stage, 10-fold concentrated incubation solutions were incubated at 37 °C with 0–200 μm concentrations of each of the three 12-halododecanoic acids either in the presence or absence of 10 mm NADPH. At specified time intervals, an aliquot (5 μl) was diluted 10-fold by the addition of 50 μl of a second stage assay mixture consisting of the same buffer, 10 mm NADPH, and 100 μm [1-14C]dodecanoic acid. The diluted mixture was incubated for a further 11 min at 37 °C and was then terminated by the addition of ice-cold 94:6 acetonitrile:acetic acid (v/v). The precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 2–5 min, and the samples were stored at –20 °C until analyzed by HPLC. Measurement of CYP4A Oxidation Activity by GC-MS—CYP4A1 ω-hydroxylation was measured by mixing together 10 μg of DLPC, 12.5 pmol of CYP4A1, 125 pmol of cytochrome P450 reductase, 12.5 pmol of cytochrome b5, and 5 μg of catalase, followed by incubation of the mixture for 10 min at room temperature. The required amount of substrate (dodecanoic acid, 12-chlorododecanoic acid (1), 12-bromododecanoic acid (2), 12-iodododecanoic acid (3), or 12,12-[2H]2-12-chlorododecanoic acid (7): usually 100 μm final concentration) was then added, followed by sufficient 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium cholate, and 20% glycerol to bring the volume to 245 μl. After an additional incubation time of 2 min at 37 °C, the reaction was started by adding 5 μlof100 mm NADPH. The mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for a period of 0–150 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 20 μl of ice-cold 6 m HCl, immediately mixing the contents of the vial and placing it on ice. The internal standard (phenylacetic acid, 100 μm final concentration) was then added and the samples were mixed again before they were transferred to solid-phase extraction. Solid-phase Extraction—In a modification of a published procedure (30Holmes V.E. Bruce M. Shaw P.N. Bell D.R. Qi F.M. Barrett D.A. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 325: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), Bond-Elut C18 cartridges (100 mg, 3 ml, Varian) were sequentially washed with 2 ml of CHCl3, methanol, and water. The incubation samples were transferred to the cartridges and the solvent was slowly pushed through under nitrogen pressure. The cartridges were then washed with 2 ml of water and were thoroughly dried for 1 h by nitrogen at 20 p.s.i. The analytes were eluted into 5-ml glass screw-top tubes with Teflon-lined caps with two 1-ml aliquots of CHCl3. The CHCl3 was evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. The samples were then converted to the trimethylsilyl derivatives by incubation with 50 μlof N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide) at 70 °C for 10–15 min. The derivatized samples were allowed to cool, vortexed, and transferred to sealed Teflon-capped glass vials for either manual or autoinjection into the GC-MS. GC-MS—Product analysis was preformed on an Agilent GC6850 Series II GC coupled to an Agilent 5973 Network Mass Spectrometry Detector. This GC-MS system was equipped with an Agilent 7683 Series autosampler interfaced with a PC computer running Agilent MSD Productivity ChemStation Revisions D.01.02 software. A 30-m DB-5 capillary column coupled with a 5-m guard column (Agilent, USA) (0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.1 μm film) was used with helium as the carrier gas at a head pressure of 50 p.s.i. Injection (3 μl) was in the split mode (10:1) with the all-glass injector temperature at 250 °C. The GC oven temperature was programmed for 1 min at 70 °C followed by a rise to 170 °C at 25 °C/min, to 200 °C at 5 °C/min, and to 280 °C at 20 °C/min. The oven was finally held at 280 °C for 5 min. The MS source and interface were maintained at 250 and 280 °C, respectively, and a solvent delay of 4 min was used. The MS was set for a full scan from 30 to 500 mass units. The analytes were identified from a total ion chromatogram. The following are the retention times and molecular masses of the trimethylsilyl derivatives of the authentic standards of the substrates and products: dodecanoic acid-TMS, 8.62 min, MR 272; 1, TMS, 12.14 min, MR 306; 2, TMS, 12.98 min, MR 350, 352; 3, TMS, 13.79 min, MR 398; 4, TMS, 11.40 min, MR 286; 5, diTMS, 13.50 min, MR 374; 6, diTMS, 12.82 min, MR 360; 7, TMS, 12.14 min, MR 308; 8, diTMS, 12.15 min, MR 360; 9, TMS, 8.42 min, MR 270. CYP2E1 Oxidation Activity by GC-MS—Standard incubations (250 μl total volume) consisted of 50 pmol of CYP2E1 microsomes (human CYP2E1 + P450 reductase + cytochrome b5 Supersomes®), substrate (100 μm), DLPC, superoxidase dismutase, catalase, and NADPH (2 mm) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The substrate (dodecanoic acid, 1 or 7) was coated on the walls of an Eppendorf tube with methanol and the methanol was removed by a stream of nitrogen before the other components were added. The NADPH was added to initiate the reaction after preincubation of the other components for 5 min at 37 °C. The incubation was continued for 2.5 h at 37 °C and was then quenched with 6 m HCl. The internal standard (phenylacetic acid, 100 μm final concentration) was then added and the samples were mixed again before they were transferred to solid-phase extraction for GC-MS analysis. Measurement of CYP4A1 Activity in 18O-Labeled Water—The procedure was nearly identical to that used for the measurement of CYP4A1 activity in normal buffer. To prepare the 18O-buffer (265 μl), 1.6 m Tris (pH 7.4 at 0 °C, 7.8 μl) was mixed with 3.5 mg of NaCl, 50 μl of glycerol, 1 μl of sodium cholate (5% in H2O), and finally 188.5 μl of H 182O. In a separate tube, the CYP4A1 system was prepared by mixing CYP4A1 (12.5 pmol), P450 reductase (125 pmol), cytochrome b5 (12.5 pmol), DLPC (10 μl, 0.5 g/liter), and catalase (2.5 μl, 10 g/liter) in their storage phosphate buffer together to a total volume of 15.6 μl. This CYP4A1 system was mixed with the 18O-buffer and incubated for 10 min at 0 °C followed by 10 min at 25 °C. The substrate (1 or 2) was then added and the mixture was preincubated at 37 °C for 2 min before NADPH was added. The final 18O-content was ∼87.5%. The incubation was continued for 2.5 h at 37 °C and was then quenched with 6 m HCl. The internal standard (phenylacetic acid, 100 μm final concentration) was then added and the samples mixed before they were transferred to solid-phase extraction for GCMS analysis. In a different protocol, after the incubation was finished, the quenching step was omitted and during the solid phase extraction, the solid phase extraction column was not washed with water to minimize possible exchange of the 18O in metabolites with 16O water. Binding of 12-Halododecanoic Acids to CYP4A1—12-Chloro-, 12-bromo-, and 12-iodododecanoic acids (Fig. 1) were titrated into a cuvette containing a solution of ferric CYP4A1 and the spectroscopic changes were recorded. Each of these three 12-halododecanoic acids caused the appearance of a binding spectrum (Fig. 2). The difference between the absorbance at 390 and 417 nm as a function of the ligand concentration gave rise to a hyperbolic plot from which the spectroscopic dissociation constant Ks was calculated (Fig. 2, inset). These measurements gave the following values for the dissociation constants of the three halododecanoic acids: 12-chloro, Ks = 11.8 μm; 12-bromo, Ks = 7.9 μm; and 12-iodo, Ks = 6.0 μm. Comparison of these values with Ks = ∼30 μm for dodecanoic acid itself indicates that all three 12-halododecanoic acids bind to CYP4A1 with similar affinities but 3–4-fold more tightly than the parent dodecanoic acid (20Dierks E.A. Davis S.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Spectrum of the binding of 12-iodododecanoic acid to CYP4A1. The spectrum of the protein before binding of a substrate (dashed line) and after binding of 12-iodododecanoic acid (solid line). The inset shows the Ks values for the three 12-halododecanoic acids. The spectroscopic binding studies were carried out in the following buffer: 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium cholate, and 20% glycerol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Products Formed in the CYP4A1-catalyzed Oxidation of 12-Halododecanoic Acids—Analysis of the products formed in incubations of CYP4A1 with the 12-halododecanoic acids identified three catalytically generated products: 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid (6), 12-oxododecanoic acid (4), and 1,12-dodecanedioic acid (5) (Fig. 3a, Table I). These peaks were the only ones present that were not also present in an incubation from which NADPH had been omitted. The identities of the products, after conversion to the trimethylsilyl derivatives, were confirmed by chromatographic and mass spectrometric comparison with similarly derivatized authentic samples. 11-Dodecenoic acid (9) was not detected as a metabolite. A small amount of dodecanoic acid was observed in all the incubations at time 0, but its concentration did not change with incubation time. This suggests that the dodecanoic acid is present as a contaminant in one of the incubation components. To confirm that the trace dodecanoic acid observed is actually a contaminant, four sets of control experiments were separately performed: (a) without NADPH, (b) without the substrate, (c) without the CYP4A1 system, and (d) under anaerobic conditions. In all of these control experiments, dodecanoic acid was detected and its ratio versus the substrate remained constant (data not shown). In view of the control experiments, the source of the contaminating dodecanoic acid is likely to be the DLPC.Table IIncubations of 1, 2, 3, and 7 with recombinant human CYP4A1 and baculovirus microsomes containing recombinant human CYP2E1456Conversionω/(ω-1)%CYP4A1130 ± 111 ± 211 ± 152 ± 30.27 ± 0.02214 ± 111 ± 113 ± 138 ± 10.51 ± 0.0431.2 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.12.9 ± 0.15.6 ± 0.31.12 ± 0.16aThis value is not reliable because the low turnover for 3 yielded data points with relatively large error limits710 ± 110 ± 112 ± 133 ± 10.61 ± 0.04CYP2E1110 ± 15.9 ± 0.410 ± 0.3b6 appears to arise from the ω-1 hydroxylation product.26 ± 1NAcNA, not available.a This value is not reliable because the low turnover for 3 yielded data points with relatively large error limitsb 6 appears to arise from the ω-1 hydroxylation product.c NA, not available.

In the presentstudy, we examined the role of SP3/SP1 transcription factors in the regulationof the Col10a1 promoter. The SP3/SP1 ratio is higher in hypertrophicversus non-hypertrophic chondrocytes, due to the significant decreasein SP1 in hypertrophic cells detected by real-time PCR and Western blotanalyses. Functional analyses by transfection-mediated overexpression of SP1and SP3 suggest that SP1 inhibits the Col10a1 promoter. This effect is negatedby an interaction with SP3 in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Additionally,mutation analysis showed that the 40-bp intervening sequence (nt –115 to–75) is required for expression of the Col10a1 gene.

Recently, expression of the COL2A1 gene in articular chondrocyteshas been shown to depend on the cooperation of SP1 with SP3(20Ghayor C. Chadjichristos C. Herrouin J.F. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G.

Downregulation of type IIcollagen during chondrocyte maturation is paralleled by specific up-regulationof type X collagen (23Castagnola P. Dozin B. Moro G. Cancedda R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thissuggests that the SP3/SP1 ratio may be one of the mechanisms coordinating thechanges in collagen expression associated with chondrocytedifferentiation. In the present study, we have analyzed the role of SP1 and SP3transcription factors in cell type-specific regulation of collagen type X inhypertrophic chondrocytes versus non-hypertrophic chondrocytes. Wehave observed that SP1, which is generally thought to function as a stimulatorof transcription, acts as an inhibitor of the Col10a1 gene in non-hypertrophicchondrocytes. In hypertrophic chondrocytes, the levels of SP1 aresignificantly lower than those in non-hypertrophic cells, and our data suggestthat the inhibitory effect of SP1 is negated in these cells by SP3 protein.Expression levels of SP3 stay almost the same in both cell types, resulting ina higher SP3/SP1 ratio in hypertrophic cells. We demonstrate that theincreased SP3/SP1 ratio results in the up-regulation of Col10a1 and that celltype-specific expression of the Col10a1 gene depends on SP3/SP1 cooperation.In addition, we have shown that the 40-bp intervening sequence between CS1 andCS2 is essential for expression of the proximal Col10a1 promoter inhypertrophic chondrocytes. This intervening sequence contains oneDlx5/6-binding site (nt –99 to –87). We have shown byelectrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) that this Dlx-bindingsite binds a hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific nuclear protein. Dlx5is expressed at higher levels in hypertrophic cells, and overexpression ofDlx5 in non-hypertrophic chondrocytes activates the proximal Col10a1promoter up to 3-fold. Taken together, these data suggest that theDlx5 transcription factor may regulate the cell type-specificexpression of collagen type X by direct binding to the proximal promoter ofthe gene. Generation of CAT Constructs—The constructs pCAT I, pCATVII, and pCAT X were generated as described previously(1Long F. Sonenshein G.E. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6542-6549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,24Long F. Linsenmayer T.F. J.Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31310-31314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Constructs were generatedby annealing the following complementary 34- or 84-bp oligonucleotides: sixconsecutive copies of CS1 (5′-CCCCACCCCT-3′) to generate pCAT-CS1;six consecutive copies of CS2 (5′-GGGGAGGAGC-3′) to generatepCAT-CS2; one copy each of CS1 and CS2 separated by four consecutive copies ofa nonsense sequence (5′-TGGACTTCAA-3′) to generate pCAT XX withmutated intervening sequence; and one copy of a SP1 consensus binding sequence(5′-GGGGCGGGGC-3′) to generate pCAT-SP1. To each oligonucleotide,a HindIII site was added at the 5′ and 3′ ends. The resultantannealed fragments were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit(Qiagen) and subjected to HindIII digestion. The digested products were clonedinto the HindIII sites of the vector pCAT X(1Long F. Sonenshein G.E. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6542-6549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmidswere sequenced (Invitrogen) to confirm their identities. The SP1 and SP3expression vectors pEVR2/SP1 and pRC/CMV/SP3 were kindly provided by Dr.Guntram Suske (25Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—All cells were primarycultures from 14-day-old chicken embryos (Spafas Inc., Norwich, CT).Hypertrophic chondrocytes were from the hypertrophic zone 3 of the tibia(26Stocum D.L. Davis R.M. Leger M. Conrad H.E. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1979; 54: 155-170PubMed Google Scholar). Nonhypertrophicchondrocytes were from the caudal one-third of the sternum and from theresting zone (zone 1) of the growth plate(26Stocum D.L. Davis R.M. Leger M. Conrad H.E. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1979; 54: 155-170PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were dissociatedby 0.125% trypsin (Invitrogen), 0.3% collagenase type I (Sigma), and 0.06%bovine testes hyaluronidase type I (Sigma) and cultured in Dulbecco's modifiedEagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone Labs)and 50 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). The hypertrophicchondrocytes were kept in culture for 2–4 weeks and passaged severaltimes before use to ensure high levels of type X collagen expression by everycell, as detected by immunostaining(2Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Biol. 1985; 107: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Non-hypertrophicchondrocytes were cultured for 4–7 days and passaged once before use.Hyaluronidase type I (Sigma) was added at 0.12 mg/ml to both types ofchondrocytes to achieve better attachment of cells on the culture dishes. For transient transfections, cells were plated on 24-well plates at104 cells/well for both types of chondrocytes. The cells were grownovernight before transfection. Plasmid DNA used for transfection was preparedusing the Qiagen plasmid kit. The transient transfections were performed usingFuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 1 μg of the experimentalconstruct (e.g. pCAT-I) and 0.2 μg of the β-galactosidaseinternal control of pSV40-β-gal (Promega) were co-transfected into cellsby 3 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent. Type I hyaluronidase was included in thetransfection medium at 0.12 mg/ml to increase the transfection efficiency(6Jacenko O. LuValle P.A. Olsen B.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Transfection mixture wasadded to the cells in 10% serum-containing media. Cells were harvested after48–62 h. To disrupt SP3/SP1 interaction, chondrocytes were incubatedwith 100 nm mithramycin (Sigma) for 24 h following the16–18-h transfection period(20Ghayor C. Chadjichristos C. Herrouin J.F. Ala-Kokko L.

In each experiment, transfections of each construct were done at least intriplicate. β-Galactosidase activity was measured with the colorimetricassay kit (Pierce) and expressed as the optical density of the substratereaction at the wavelength of 420 nm (A420). CAT (in pg)was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an anti-CAT antibody(Roche Applied Science). Normalized levels of CAT expression were calculatedas the ratio of CAT protein to β-galactosidase activity (i.e.CAT/β-galactosidase). The mean value of CAT/β-galactosidase ratiosfrom multiple transfections for each construct was taken as its CAT expressionlevel in the experiment. Results presented in this study are from two or moreseparate experiments. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear Extracts ofchondrocyte cultures were prepared using the NE-PER kit (Pierce). Aliquotswere frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath and stored at –80 °C untiluse. Protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay kit(Pierce). EMSA—Annealing complementary synthetic oligonucleotidesgenerated double-stranded DNA probes. These were then labeled with32Pby a forward reaction with T4 kinase (Invitrogen), and theproducts were purified by Nensorb 20 cartridges (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).EMSA was performed as described previously(1Long F. Sonenshein G.E. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6542-6549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using the EMSA kit reagents(Pierce). The 34-bp double-stranded oligonucleotideGGATGCGTATCCGCCGGCGTCGTTTCGCTTATAC was used as a nonspecific competitor DNA at50 ng/μl. Nuclear extracts of 7–14 μg and ∼1–3 ×104 cpm of probes were used in each reaction. For competitionassays, cold competitors were added in 200–400 molar excess. Western Blotting—20 μg of nuclear extracts in reducingbuffer were loaded onto 5–15% Tris-polyacrylamide gels in denaturingconditions, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferredto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), blocked with 5% dry milkovernight at 4 °C, and incubated with 1 μg/ml rabbit anti-SP1 or rabbitanti-SP3 antibody (Santa Cruz). Bands were visualized with a horseradishperoxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, followed by ECLusing the SuperSignal kit (Pierce). Preparation of RNA and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated usingTRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 2.5μg of total RNA by using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).PCR amplification was performed for 30 cycles to analyze gene expression withthe following primers: chicken SP1, primers TCAACGCCGCCCAACGTCTCC (positions1531–1550) and CCGCGCCGCCTTCTTGTTC (positions 2105–2124); chickenSP3, primers AGGTGGGGCACTGACATCAA (positions 1679–1698) andTTGTTCCTCCCGCAGTAATC (positions 2394–2413); and chicken β-actin,primers ATATTGCTGCGCTCGTTGTTGTTGAC (positions 79–99) andGCATGGGGGAGGGCGTAG (positions 572–589). Real-time quantitative RT-PCRwas performed using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). Reactions weredone in triplicates for each pair of primers, using the ABI 5700 sequencedetector. Results were analyzed using the Microsoft Excel program. Expression Levels of SP1 and SP3—Our previous data suggestedthat 1) transcription factors of the SP family may be differentially expressedin non-hypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes and 2) binding of the SPproteins to the noncanonical CS-binding sites within the proximal promoter ofthe Col10a1 gene seemed to occur at different ratios in these cell types(1Long F. Sonenshein G.E. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6542-6549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These observations allowedsuggesting regulation of collagen X expression by interacting SP factors.Another collagen gene, COL2A1, is also regulated by the ratio of twoSP proteins (SP1 and SP3), as has been recently demonstrated in articularchondrocytes (21Chadjichristos C. Ghayor C. Herrouin J.F. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G. Pujol J.P. Galera P. J.Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43903-43917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,22Chadjichristos C. Ghayor C. Kypriotou M. Martin G. Renard E. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G. de Crombrugghe B. Pujol J.P. Galera P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39762-39772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Increase in the SP3/SP1ratio mediates down-regulation of collagen II induced by transforming growthfactor-β in differentiating articular chondrocytes. Similarly, collagenII levels decrease during chondrocyte differentiation from non-hypertrophic tohypertrophic state, whereas collagen X is up-regulated(23Castagnola P. Dozin B. Moro G. Cancedda R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, we proposedthat the ratio of SP1 to SP3 transcription factors may regulate thetranscription of chicken Col10a1 gene in differentiating chondrocytes. To address this hypothesis, we first determined the levels of SP1 and SP3in nuclear fractions of chondrocytes by Western blot analysis(Fig. 1). We observed that SP3protein was expressed at similar levels in both cell types, but SP1 wasclearly greater in non-hypertrophic cells. These results were confirmed andquantified by real-time RT-PCR. By this method, the level of SP1 mRNA in thenon-hypertrophic chondrocytes was almost 20-fold higher than that ofhypertrophic cells (non-hypertrophic/hypertrophic cells = 19.7 ±5.7-fold, when normalized to the levels of mRNA for β-actin). Conversely,the SP3 mRNA was basically the same for the two cell types(non-hypertrophic/hypertrophic cells = 0.73 ± 0.12-fold). The observeddecrease in SP1 expression associated with chondrocyte maturation results in ahigher SP3/SP1 ratio in hypertrophic versus non-hypertrophicchondrocytes (Fig.1B). Similarly, the SP3/SP1 ratio in non-hypertrophicchondrocytes from the growth plate (resting chondrocytes from zone 1 of thegrowth plate) (26Stocum D.L. Davis R.M. Leger M. Conrad H.E. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1979; 54: 155-170PubMed Google Scholar) appears tobe much lower than that in hypertrophic cells(Fig. 1B,NH-zone1). This result suggests that the same regulatory mechanismsmay control Col10a1 expression in cells that remain undifferentiatedthroughout their life time (i.e. sternal chondrocytes) and inchondrocytes, which will differentiate into hypertrophic cells (i.e.the growth plate chondrocytes). Regulation of Col10a1 Expression by SP1 Activity in Non-hypertrophicChondrocytes—Despite the fact that SP1 often acts as atranscriptional activator for different genes in a variety of cell types(27Kaczynski J. Cook T. Urrutia R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), including collagen genes(20Ghayor C. Chadjichristos C. Herrouin J.F. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G. Pujol J.P. Galera P. J.Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36881-36895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we detected higherlevels of this transcription factor in non-hypertrophic chondrocytes (which donot express type X collagen) than in hypertrophic chondrocytes, whichsynthesize the molecule. These data suggested that in non-hypertrophicchondrocytes, SP1 might act as an inhibitor of the Col10a1 gene. To analyze the transcriptional activity of SP1 factor in non-hypertrophicand hypertrophic chondrocytes, we transfected both cell types with a pCAT-SP1reporter vector construct. This construct was obtained by linking a consensusbinding site for SP1 (GGGGCGGGGC) to the basal (55-bp) promoter from theCol10a1 gene, which shows little expression in either cell type(Fig. 2A,pCAT-X) (1Long F. Sonenshein G.E. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6542-6549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Innon-hypertrophic chondrocytes, the reporter activity of the pCAT-SP1 vectorwas ∼3-fold lower than that in hypertrophic chondrocytes. The apparentinverse relationship between the abundance of SP1 mRNA and protein and theSP1-dependent CAT production in non-hypertrophic cells is consistent with aninhibitory role for this transcription factor (see the next paragraph and“Discussion”). In addition, these experiments reveal an essentialrole of the SP-binding site in supporting the activity of the Col10a1 basalpromoter. Thus, the pCAT-SP1 construct was more active in both cell types thanthe pCAT X construct (Fig.2A). This result indicates that an SP factor other thanSP1 (supposedly, SP3) may act as a positive regulator of transcription inchondrocytes. There are two possible mechanisms for the inhibitory action of SP1 onCol10a1 promoter: SP1 may function as a direct inhibitor of genetranscription, and in this case, expression of collagen type X in hypertrophicchondrocytes is associated with the reduced protein levels of SP1 in this celltype (Fig. 1). If so,increasing the levels of SP1 in hypertrophic chondrocytes should result indecreased expression of the Col10a1 gene in these cells(2Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev.

Alternatively, SP1 mayactually act as an activator/positive regulator of Col10a1 promoter, but innon-hypertrophic cells this activity may be specifically repressed. If this isthe case, then increasing the expression of SP1 in hypertrophic cells shouldeither increase expression of Col10a1 or have no effect at all (if the maximumexpression of Col10a1 has already been achieved). To test these possibilities, we co-transfected hypertrophic chondrocytecell cultures with a pCATI reporter construct that exhibits cell typespecificity for Col10a1 expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes(24Long F. Linsenmayer T.F. J.Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31310-31314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and SP1-producing plasmid(pEVR2/SP1) (25Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar).Overexpression of SP1 (up to 4-fold) was verified by Western blot analysis(data not shown). In the hypertrophic chondrocytes, overexpression of SP1resulted in an ∼4-fold decrease in CAT activity, as compared with controlcell cultures transfected with the pCATI plasmid alone(Fig. 2B). Inaddition, real-time PCR analysis revealed a 28% down-regulation of endogenousCol10a1 mRNA in hypertrophic chondrocytes overexpressing SP1 transcriptionfactor. The extent of endogenous Col10a1 down-regulation may be even greaterbut masked by low efficiency of transfection in hypertrophic chondrocytes(usually <20%). In the similarly co-transfected non-hypertrophic cells,which have very low levels of pCAT1 expression and high levels of endogenousSP1, no detectable changes of CAT reporter gene have been observed (data notshown). Taken together, these results suggest that SP1 factor may directlyinhibit the activity of the proximal Col10a1 promoter. Therefore, highendogenous levels of SP1 in non-hypertrophic chondrocytes may represent onemechanism of negative regulation of type X collagen expression in this celltype. Effects of SP1 and SP3 on the Transcription Activity of Col10a1 Gene inHypertrophic Chondrocytes—Our data indicate that SP3 may act astranscriptional activator of the basal Col10a1 promoter(Fig. 3A).Additionally, it may interact with SP1 to negate its inhibitory effect.Therefore, we analyzed whether interactions between SP3 and SP1 factorsregulate the Col10a1 gene in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Recent studiesdemonstrate that increased SP3/SP1 ratio mediates the transforming growthfactor-β- and interleukin-1β-induced inhibition of type II collagenby restraining the activating effects of SP1(21Chadjichristos C.

Coupled with theobservation (described above) that the SP3/SP1 ratio is higher in hypertrophicversus non-hypertrophic chondrocytes and that SP1 may act as anegative regulator of the Col10a1 gene, we hypothesized that in hypertrophicchondrocytes SP3 may repress the proposed inhibitory activity of SP1 on theCol10a1 gene. If so, this could confer tissue-specific expression of theprotein to hypertrophic cartilage. To determine whether interactions between SP3 and SP1 are, in fact,involved in regulating Col10a1 expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes, wedisrupted these interactions with 100 nm mithramycin, an inhibitorof SP1 and SP3 binding (21Chadjichristos C. Ghayor C. Herrouin J.F. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G. Pujol J.P. Galera P. J.Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43903-43917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Treatment with mithramycin caused a dramatic reduction in CAT activity inhypertrophic chondrocytes transfected with pCATI(Fig. 3A,HYP, +M). This is consistent with SP3 negating the potentialinhibitory effect of SP1 on the Col10a1 gene and indicates that a relativelyhigh SP3/SP1 ratio can support the cell type-specific expression of type Xcollagen in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Conversely, when non-hypertrophicchondrocytes (which have high levels of SP1 and therefore a low SP3/SP1 ratio)were treated with mithramycin (Fig.3A, NH), there was no change in pCATIexpression, possibly reflecting the presence of “unbound” SP1available for inhibition even in the absence of the mithramycin. The potential of SP3 to counteract the inhibitory action of SP1 on theCol10a1 gene was further assessed by co-transfecting non-hypertrophic(Fig. 3B, NH)and hypertrophic (Fig.3B, HYP) chondrocytes with pCATI and SP3 plasmid(pRC/CMV/SP3) (25Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar).Overexpression of SP3 increased the relative CAT activity in both cell typesup to 150% (Fig.3B). In addition, we analyzed the effect of SP3 on expression of endogenous typeX collagen in the non-hypertrophic resting chondrocytes of the growth plate,which have the same low SP3/SP1 ratio as the non-hypertrophic chondrocytesfrom sterna. Similarly to its effect on sternal non-hypertrophic chondrocytes,higher levels of SP3 result in ∼2-fold increase of endogenous Col10a1 mRNAin resting chondrocytes as detected by real-time PCR(Fig. 3C, cellcultures). Although in vivo resting chondrocytes do notsynthesize collagen type X, they initiate its synthesis very rapidly in cellcultures. A significant number of type X collagen-positive cells (up to 20%)can be detected immunohi"

Investigating the evolution of proteins involved in tissue calcification should help elucidate how calcified tissues have evolved. The purpose of this study was to collect and compare sequences of matrix and bone γ-carboxyglutamic acid proteins (MGP and BGP, respectively) to identify common features and determine the evolutionary relationship between MGP and BGP. Thirteen cDNAs and genes were cloned using standard methods or reconstructed through the use of comparative genomics and data mining. These sequences were compared with available annotated sequences (a total of 48 complete or nearly complete sequences, 28 BGPs and 20 MGPs) have been identified across 32 different species (representing most classes of vertebrates), and evolutionarily conserved features in both MGP and BGP were analyzed using bioinformatic tools and the Tree-Puzzle software. We propose that: 1) MGP and BGP genes originated from two genome duplications that occurred around 500 and 400 million years ago before jawless and jawed fish evolved, respectively; 2) MGP appeared first concomitantly with the emergence of cartilaginous structures, and BGP appeared thereafter along with bony structures; and 3) BGP derives from MGP. We also propose a highly specific pattern definition for the Gla domain of BGP and MGP."
https://openalex.org/W2042864621,"In an attempt to characterize the molecular components by which electric activity influences the development of synapses, we searched for cell surface proteins modulated by calcium influx and glutamate receptor activity. Here, we report that neuronal depolarization facilitates the conversion of CALEB, which results in a truncated transmembrane form with an exposed EGF domain. To characterize the role of CALEB in synapse development, synaptic features were investigated in slices of the colliculus superior from CALEB-deficient mice. In the absence of CALEB, the number of synapses and their morphological characteristics remained unchanged. However, in CALEB-deficient mice, synapses displayed higher paired-pulse ratios, less depression during prolonged repetitive activation, a lower rate of spontaneous postsynaptic currents, and a lower release probability at early but not mature postnatal stages. Our findings indicate that CALEB provides a molecular basis for maintaining normal release probability at early developmental stages."

Prior structural work identified the determinants responsible for the recognition and binding of UDP-glucose and the catalytic manganese ion and implicated two aspartic acid residues in the reaction mechanism for self-glucosylation. We examined the effects of substituting asparagine and serine for the aspartic acid residues at positions 159 and 162. We also examined whether the truncation of the protein at residue 270 (Δ270) was compatible with its structural integrity and its functional role as the initiator for glycogen synthesis. The truncated form of the enzyme was indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme by all measures of activity and could support glycogen accumulation in a glycogenin-deficient yeast strain. Substitution of aspartate 159 by either serine or asparagine eliminated self-glucosylation and reduced trans-glucosylation activity by at least 260-fold but only reduced UDP-glucose hydrolytic activity by 4-14-fold. Substitution of aspartate 162 by either serine or asparagine eliminated self-glucosylation activity and reduced UDP-glucose hydrolytic activity by at least 190-fold. The trans-glucosylation of maltose was reduced to undetectable levels in the asparagine 162 mutant, whereas the serine 162 enzyme showed only an 18-30-fold reduction in its ability to trans-glucosylate maltose.

https://openalex.org/W1973071599,"Inositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) β1 is a key enzyme in nuclear lipid signal transduction affecting cell cycle progression and may be directly involved in regulation of gene expression and hematopoiesis. By microarrays, we compared the effect of nuclear PLCβ1 overexpression with that of PLC M2b cytoplasmatic mutant, which is exclusively located in the cytoplasm, in murine erythroleukemia cells. Out of 9000 genes analyzed, the CD24 gene, coding for an antigen involved in differentiation and hematopoiesis as well, was up-regulated in cells overexpressing nuclear PLCβ1 as compared with both cells overexpressing the M2b cytoplasmatic mutant and the wild type cells. Here we show that nuclear PLCβ1 up-regulated the expression of CD24. The correlation was strengthened by the observation that when PLCβ1 expression was silenced by means of small interfering RNA, CD24 expression was down-regulated. We also demonstrated that PLCβ1-dependent up-modulation of CD24 was mediated, at least in part, at the transcriptional level, in that PLCβ1 affected the CD24 promoter activity. Moreover, the up-regulation of CD24 was higher during erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells.

Inositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; siRNA, small interfering RNA; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase; WT, wild type; RT, reverse transcription. β1 is a key enzyme in the lipid signaling pathway. PLCβ1 hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, giving rise to the two second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Both of them are involved in signal transduction cascades that influence many cellular events, including cell cycle progression and differentiation (1Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). PLCβ1 exists in two forms, generated by an alternative splicing of the same transcript, which differ in apparent mass: 150-kDa PLCβ1a and 140-kDa PLCβ1b. Both forms are present mostly in the nucleus of the cell (2Irvine R.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 3Martelli A.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 101: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The importance of this cellular localization has been analyzed by means of a PLCβ1 mutant (M2b) defective in nuclear localization. Previously, stable clones, obtained overexpressing PLCβ1a, PLCβ1b, and M2b in Friend erythroleukemia cells, have been analyzed to find out downstream targets of nuclear PLCβ1 signaling. As a result, it has been shown that the overexpression of PLCβ1 induces cell cycle progression targeting cyclin D3, along with its specific kinase (4Faenza I. Matteucci A. Manzoli L. Billi A.M.

Therefore, we have studied the effects of PLCβ1 signaling by using a broad pattern approach, taking advantage of microarray technology. DNA microarrays permit the simultaneous comparison of the expression levels of thousands of genes among different samples. We have analyzed the global transcription pattern in wild type Friend erythroleukemia cells as well as in overexpressing PLCβ1a, PLCβ1b, or the cytoplasmic mutant M2b. Out of 9000 genes represented in the chip, we focused on the gene encoding the murine CD24, whose pattern of expression was significantly different in cells overexpressing nuclear PLCβ1 in comparison with both wild type cells and M2b cytoplasmic mutant. Both mouse CD24, also named heat stable antigen, and its human homologue are small cell surface proteins, which are anchored to the membrane by means of glycosylphosphatidylinositol. They are heavily N- and O-glycosylated, accounting for their broad variation in apparent molecular weight, in a cell type-dependent fashion. The protein has been detected in a variety of cell types, including hematopoietic cells, neurons, regenerating muscle, or epithelial cells. In hematopoietic lines, it was initially discovered in K562 human erythroleukemia cells (5Wenger R.H. Ayane M. Bose R. Kohler G. Nielsen P.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and in immature B and T lymphocytes. CD24 is notably expressed on most immature hematopoietic lineages, whereas its expression is low or absent in terminally differentiated cells (6Hough M.R. Chappel M.S. Sauvageau G. Takei F. Kay R. Humphries R.K. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 479-488PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wenger R.H. Rochelle J.M. Seldin M.F. Kohler G. Nielsen P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23345-23352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first identified function was as a CD28-independent co-stimulatory molecule on activated B cells (8Hubbe M. Altevogt P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition to B cells, it is expressed on immature T cells, where it promotes the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes (9Liu Y. Jones B. Brady W. Janeway Jr., C.A. Linsley P.S. Linley P.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2855-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). CD24 also functions as a ligand of P-selectin, an adhesion receptor present on activated endothelial cells and platelets, thus contributing to the metastasizing capacity of CD24-expressing tumor cells (10Aigner S. Sthoeger Z.M. Fogel M. Weber E. Zarn J. Ruppert M. Zeller Y. Vestweber D. Stahel R. Sammar M. Altevogt P. Blood. 1997; 89: 3385-3395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD24 is expressed on differentiating neurons during development, negatively regulates cell proliferation in zones of secondary neurogenesis (11Belvindrah R. Rougon G. Chazal G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3594-3607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and constitutes a genetic modifier for susceptibility and progression of multiple sclerosis (12Zhou Q. Rammohan K. Lin S. Robinson N. Li O. Liu X. Bai X.F. Yin L. Scarberry B. Du P. You M. Guan K. Zheng P. Liu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15041-15046Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, CD24 is an important prognostic marker of different tumor types. The up-regulation of CD24 transcription observed by microarray analysis and the role of CD24 in hematopoiesis prompted us to investigate whether the expression of CD24 is indeed up-regulated by nuclear PLCβ1. We report that overexpression of PLCβ1 resulted in the up-regulation of CD24 and, conversely, that siRNA silencing of PLCβ1 resulted in the down-regulation of CD24. The regulation was exerted, at least in part, at the transcriptional level, and CD24 up-regulation was higher during erythroid differentiation in vitro. Murine erythroleukemia cells (Friend cells, clone 707) were grown in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (BioWhittaker). Erythroid differentiation was induced by the addition of 1.5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (Merck) to the culture medium for 3 days (72 h). The full-length cDNA for rat PLCβ1a and PLCβ1b (13Bahk Y.Y. Lee Y.H. Lee T.G. Seo J. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8240-8245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for the M2b mutant for the nuclear localization sequence, in which the lysine residues 1056, 1063, and 1070 of the COOH terminus were substituted with isoleucine by means of site-directed mutagenesis, were cloned into pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) expression vector plasmid as described elsewhere (14Kim C.G. Park D. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from the cells by using the denaturing guanidinium isothiocyanate method (RNeasy mini kit; Qiagen). Fifty micrograms of each RNA sample were resuspended in RNA loading buffer (50% formamide, 2.2 m formaldehyde, and 1× electrophoresis buffer) and electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel with 2 mm 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, 0.5 mm sodium acetate, and 0.1 mm EDTA as the electrophoresis buffer. RNAs were transferred from the gel onto a nylon membrane and UV cross-linked for 1 min. The membrane was prehybridized at 42 °C in prehybridization mix (50% ultrapure formamide, 1 m NaCl, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 200 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA) for over 4 h. The mouse cDNA probe for CD24 was a random, prime-labeled, PCR-generated product obtained using the following primers: 5′-CTTCTGGCACTGCTCCTACC-3′ and 5′-CACATTGGACTTGTGGTTGC-3. The cDNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random priming method and the Klenow reaction. Membranes were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with fresh prehybridization solution plus the denatured 32P-labeled probe. After hybridization, the blot was washed once for 30 min at room temperature with 3× SSC/1% SDS and twice for 30 min at 42 °C with 2× SSC/1%SDS and exposed to a Kodak image station 2000R overnight. Total RNA was extracted as described above for Northern blot. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of tRNA using 200 units of M-MLV reverse transcriptase, 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) primers, 25 units of ribonuclease inhibitor, 10 mm each dNTP for 1 h at 42 °C. PCR was performed with 5 μl of cDNA using 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm each dNTP, 20 μm each primer, 0.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (all reagents from Promega). Primers were designed as follows: PLCβ1: forward, 5′-GGGGTACCCCAAATGCTTGTCTGGCCTCC-3′, reverse, 5′-GCTCTAGAGCCTGGTGAACTATATTCAGCC-3′; β-actin: forward, 5′-TCATGAAGTGTGACGTTGACATCCGT-3′, reverse, 5′-CTTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGCACGATG-3′. A hypotonic shock combined with non-ionic detergent (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 1% Nonidet P-40), essentially as described by Martelli et al. (15Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), has been used. In addition, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.3 μm aprotinin, 15 μg/ml calpain I inhibitor, and 7.5 μg/ml calpain II inhibitor were also added to the buffer (lysis buffer). For each experiment, 10 × 106 cells were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer and incubated for 5 min at 0 °C. Nuclear supernatant fraction (crude cytoplasm) was precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and solubilized in 200 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer. Nuclear purity was assessed by detection of β-tubulin, and only nuclei showing a complete absence of β-tubulin in Western blot were used in the reported experiments. The cytoplasmic fraction was obtained by homogenizing 10 × 106 cells with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.8) and 2 mm MgCl2 plus protease inhibitors, as described above, and then pelleting the nuclei at 400 × g. This procedure allows the recovery of pure cytoplasmic fraction and avoids the possible risk of contamination by nuclear debris. Cytoplasmatic proteins were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and solubilized in 200 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer. To compare properly the nuclear fraction versus the cytosolic one, we have also used as a cytoplasmic fraction the supernatant of nuclear preparation described above. The purity of cytoplasmatic fraction was assessed by checking the absence of histone H3. Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing 5 × 106 cells in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with a set of protease inhibitors: 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 60 μg of proteins from the purified nuclei, cytoplasmic fractions, and whole cell extracts were separated on 6 or 10% polyacrylamide-0.1% SDS gels, as specified in the figure legends. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for subsequent immunodetection with the specific antibodies, and detected by using ECL method (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized in a Kodak digital image station 2000R. The following antibodies were used: monoclonal antibody anti-PLCβ1a and -1b and goat polyclonal anti-histone H3 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; monoclonal antibody anti-CD24 (clone M1/69) from Pharmingen, and monoclonal antibody anti-β-tubulin from Sigma. Densitometric analysis of the blots was performed by using a Kodak image station 2000R. For microarray experiments, Agilent (Agilent Technologies) mouse cDNA arrays were used. Total RNA was extracted using the denaturing guanidinium isothiocyanate method, as described for Northern blot and RT-PCR. Both reverse transcription labeling and hybridization were performed following the instructions recommended by Agilent Technologies. Equivalent amounts of Cy3-cDNA and Cy5-cDNA were quantified using NanoDrop spectrophotometer and then combined, vacuum-dried, resuspended in water with deposition hybridization buffer (Agilent), mouse Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen), and deposition control target (Operon Technologies), and hybridized to microarray slides for ~17 h, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The slides were washed with 0.5× SSC + 0.1% SDS for 10 min and with 0.06× SSC for 5 min. Hybridized slides were scanned using the ScanArray LITE confocal laser scanner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), minimizing the total number of saturated spots for both channels. Image analysis was performed with QuantArray software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Spots showing evident blemishes were flagged and excluded from the analysis. For each spot, signal intensity for both channels was calculated by subtracting local back-ground. For each array, a normalization factor was calculated dividing the total signal intensity of all the spots in the Cy3 channel by the signal of all the spots in the Cy5 channel. Spots whose measured area was higher than 50% of the average element size on the array in at least one channel were kept for further analysis. Ratios between the mean net fluorescence from the Cy3 channel and the mean net fluorescence from Cy5 channel were calculated for each spot. Cy3/Cy5 expression ratios were log-transformed (base 2). A cut-off filtering criterion was employed; only those genes with greater than 2-fold induction or repression in both comparisons were considered. CD24 promoter activity was analyzed by using a construct containing the 5′-promoter sequence of CD24 conjugated with a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene. Two plasmids were employed as controls and used to normalize the data. One plasmid contained the same CD24 promoter sequence, but in inverse orientation, the other plasmid was a pCAT basic control plasmid (Promega). Transient transfection of these vectors into Friend cells was performed using an Amaxa Nucleofector™ apparatus (Amaxa), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 × 107 cells were resuspended in the specified electroporation buffer R plus 5 μg of the plasmid. Two days later, cells were lysed, and the amount of protein present in cell extracts was determined using the Lowry protein assay (Bio-Rad). CAT expression was measured in duplicate using the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the supplier. Values of CAT are given as average of at least three independent experiments and are reported as percentage. Construction of Antisense RNA of the PLCβ1 Gene—For use as antisense RNA, a segment corresponding to bases 379-398, from the initiation ATG start site of PLCβ1, corresponding to sequence 5′-AAGTGGCCAAGGAATGG-3′ was inserted into the vector pRNA-H1/Neo (SD1203) (GenScript). The construct was transfected as described above. The transformants were selected by limiting dilution in medium containing the neomycin analogue G418 at a concentration of 500 μg/ml. Clones were harvested and expanded separately in the presence of G418. The silencing efficiency was detected by Western blot analyses using specific antibodies. To identify new genes up- or down-regulated by the expression of PLCβ1, four independent cDNA microarray assays were performed. For these experiments, four different clones, all obtained from a parental Friend erythroleukemia cell line, were compared. The four stable clones overexpressed one of the following: PLCβ1a, PLCβ1b, or PLCβ1 M2b cytoplasmic mutant or the empty vector (mock-transfected), respectively. Agilent mouse cDNA microarrays, which contain probes for about 9000 genes, were used. In each experiment, poly(A)+ RNA from two clones was competitively hybridized to the chip, and the distribution of fluorescence intensity ratio between the two samples was compared and analyzed using the standard methodology detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” To identify modifications in gene expression due to the nuclear localization of PLCβ1, the effect of nuclear PLCβ1 overexpression was compared with that of PLCβ1 M2b cytoplasmic mutant. Moreover, the global transcription profile of PLCβ1-overexpressing cells was compared with that of wild type cells (mock-transfected). First of all, we have checked the distribution of PLCβ1 in purified nuclei as well as in both the cytosolic and the nuclear supernatant fractions. Fig. 1 shows that in wild type cells, 90% of PLCβ1b was in the nuclear fraction, whereas PLCβ1a distributed between the nuclear and cytoplasmatic fractions (45 and 55%, respectively). When overexpressed, PLCβ1a localized mainly to the nucleus (5.3-fold higher level in nucleus than in the cytoplasm), whereas PLCβ1b localized exclusively to the nucleus. Notwithstanding these differences, because of the overall high level of PLCβ1a expression, the amount of nuclear PLCβ1b was 2.1-fold lower than that of PLCβ1a, as assessed by densitometric analysis of the Western blots. Of note, the relative amounts of overexpressed proteins present in the cytoplasmatic fraction were approximately the same, either whether the quantification is carried out in the cytoplasm obtained by Dounce homogenization of the cells or whether the quantification is carried out in the supernatant of nuclear purification (Fig. 1). Moreover, it is worthwhile mentioning that both cytoplasmic fractions do not show histone H3, a marker of chromatin contamination, hinting that the two procedures employed do not give rise to nuclear lysis. When overexpressed, the M2b mutant was entirely cytoplasmic. Out of the 9000 genes analyzed, one of them, the murine CD24 (GenBank™ accession number AI120876), was up-regulated in cells overexpressing PLCβ1 in the nucleus, as compared with cells overexpressing the mutant in the cytoplasm M2b or with the wild type cells. Specifically, the level of the nuclear CD24 gene expression in PLCβ1-overexpressing clone was on average 2.10-fold higher as compared with M2b-overexpressing clone and 2.80-fold higher as compared with wild type clone. To confirm these data, both semiquantitative RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis were performed using the same RNA employed in the microarray studies and independently extracted RNAs. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, PLCβ1a and -1b overexpression increased CD24 mRNA level 3.0- and 2.5-fold relative to the wild type cells, respectively. By contrast, the M2b mutant exhibited a level of transcript undistinguishable from that of wild type cells. In Northern blot analysis, the amount of RNA loaded in each lane was similar, as assessed by the quantity of 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA (Fig. 2A). The results of RT-PCR experiments were substantially similar and showed a high increase of CD24 message particularly in PLCβ1a-overexpressing cells (data not shown). Both experiments validate the array-based up-regulation in CD24 gene expression. To ascertain whether the increase of CD24 at the transcription resulted in an increase at protein level, we performed Western blot analysis. Fig. 2B shows that CD24 protein, already present in the wild type cell line, was highly increased in both PLCβ1a- and -1b-overexpressing clones, confirming and extending the Northern blot and arrays results. The densitometric quantification of the increase indicates that the effect of PLCβ1a is 1.5-fold stronger than that of PLCβ1b, and this parallels the levels of the overexpression of the two PLCβ1 splicing variants (Fig. 1 and legend). Given that Friend erythroleukemia cells can be induced to differentiate toward erythrocytes, we next addressed the issue of whether the CD24 expression was modulated during erythroid differentiation. Therefore, we focused on the PLCβ1a-overexpressing cells that displayed the higher levels of CD24. In addition, the PLCβ1a clone exhibited the higher expression of the PLCβ1 in the nucleus, i.e. 2.1-fold higher than the PLCβ1b clone (Fig. 1). Cells were grown in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (growth medium) or committed to differentiation by exposure to 1.5% Me2SO (differentiation medium) and harvested at different time points during 72 h of tissue culture. Fig. 2C shows that the level of CD24 increased dramatically during erythroid differentiation and reached a very high level of expression at 72 h of Me2SO treatment. Next, we asked whether the up-regulation of CD24 observed during differentiation of PLCβ1a-overexpressing cells took place also in the other clones. As shown in Fig. 3, cells overexpressing PLCβ1b exhibited an up-regulation of CD24, whereas cells overexpressing M2b mutant or wild type cells exhibited no up-regulation. We infer that CD24 is specifically up-regulated in cells that overexpress the nuclear PLCβ1a and -1b. The higher level of CD24 expression observed in PLCβ1a-overexpressing clone relative to the PLCβ1b-overexpressing cells (240- versus 110-fold increase) most likely reflects the higher level of expression of the two isoforms, seeing that the PLCβ1a was 2.1-fold more expressed than PLCβ1b. To provide further evidence that CD24 up-regulation is dependent on PLCβ1 expression, we silenced PLCβ1 mRNA and protein expression in wild type and PLCβ1a-overexpressing cells by means of siRNA. For this purpose, a 21-nucleotide-long fragment complementary to the common sequence of both PLCβ1a and -1b was cloned in pRNA-H1/Neo vector under H1 promoter. siRNA-expressing clones were generated and induced to differentiate so that the effect of siRNA-induced inhibition was tested under conditions of maximal CD24 up-regulation. As can be seen in Fig. 4, siRNA was effective in decreasing PLCβ1 expression in both WT and PLCβ1a-overexpressing clones, as detected at messenger level by RT-PCR (Fig. 4A) and at protein level by Western blot (Fig. 4B). The silencing induced a strong reduction of CD24 expression, in both cell lines (Fig. 4C). These data strongly support a role for PLCβ1 as a regulator of CD24 protein expression. The last series of experiments was designed to investigate whether the PLCβ1-induced regulation of CD24 expression is exerted at the transcriptional level. Plasmids containing the 5′-flanking promoter region of CD24 fused in sense or antisense direction to a CAT reporter gene were transfected in wild type or PLCβ1a-overexpressing cells and their respective silenced clones. The amount of CAT protein was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 48 h after transfection. Fig. 5 shows the average of three independent experiments. PLCβ1a overexpression resulted in about a 2-fold increase of CD24 promoter activity. When PLCβ1 was silenced, the activation of the CD24 promoter was decreased by about 50% in wild type clone and by about 30% in PLCβ1a-overexpressing clones. These findings provide evidence that the up-regulation of CD24 expression induced by PLCβ1 is mediated, at least in part, at the transcriptional level. The initial aim of this study was to identify new genes regulated by PLCβ1, given the role exerted by its signaling in the nucleus during cell growth and differentiation (3Martelli A.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 101: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and its potential involvement in the progression of myelodysplastic syndrome to acute myeloid leukemia (16Lo Vasco V.R. Calabrese G. Manzoli L. Palka G. Spadano A. Morizio E. Guanciali-Franchi P. Fantasia D. Cocco L. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 2004; 18: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The novel finding that emerged by the microarray experiments was an up-modulation of CD24 in cells overexpressing PLCβ1 in the nucleus as compared with the effect of the M2b cytoplasmic mutant, which did not induce any increase. It is worthwhile to recall that the M2b mutant induces a forced expression of PLCβ1 in the cytoplasmatic compartment (4Faenza I. Matteucci A. Manzoli L. Billi A.M. Aluigi M. Peruzzi D. Vitale M. Castorina S. Suh P.G. Cocco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30520-30524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and constitutes a good tool to discriminate the different role of PLCβ1 as a function of its subcellular localization. Current results strengthen and extend previous characterization of the M2b mutant and show that the M2b mutant localized exclusively to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1) (14Kim C.G. Park D. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 17Faenza I. Matteucci A. Bavelloni A. Marmiroli S. Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Suh P.G. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Indeed, as shown previously in the same cells, when PLCβ1 M2b mutant is overexpressed in the cytoplasm, the endogenous PLCβ1 in the nucleus is still present, but at a very low level with respect to the cytoplasmic one. The difference in subcellular localization is thought to inhibit the physiological role of the nuclear PLCβ1 (4Faenza I. Matteucci A. Manzoli L. Billi A.M. Aluigi M. Peruzzi D. Vitale M. Castorina S. Suh P.G. Cocco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30520-30524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As regards CD24 expression, the M2b accumulation in the cytoplasm inhibits CD24 expression in comparison with the effect of the overexpression of both PLCβ1a and -1b in the nucleus (Figs. 1, 2, 3). The conclusion that up-modulation of CD24 is regulated by PLCβ1 nuclear signaling stems from three lines of evidence. Firstly, the microarray studies clearly indicated an increase in CD24 transcription. Secondly, up-regulation of CD24 was quantitatively confirmed both at the RNA messenger level by Northern blot and at the protein level by Western blot. Both assays show that CD24 expression was augmented in PLCβ1a- and -1b-overexpressing clones and was significantly not affected in the clone overexpressing the cytoplasmic mutant. It is worthwhile to take into account that although both PLCβ1a and -1b reside in the nucleus, the overexpression of PLCβ1a is higher than that of PLCβ1b. When comparing their effect on CD24 expression over wild type cells, the effect is very similar in that the increase of CD24 level is proportional to the overexpression of the two PLCβ1 isoforms in the nucleus. Thirdly, we took advantage of silencing PLCβ1 by small interfering RNA (18Dorsett Y. Tuschl T. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 318-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). We have specifically knocked down PLCβ1 expression by transfecting a vector encoding a 21-nucleotide-long RNA complementary to the sequence of PLCβ1. This resulted in an almost complete ablation of the expression of both of the endogenous PLCβ1s present in wild type Friend cells and of all the PLCβ1 overexpressed forms. The silencing gives rise to a dramatic down-modulation of CD24, as compared with the non-silenced ones. We are keen to underline that siRNA acts on both PLCβ1a and -1b as well as on the M2b mutant, in that the target site of siRNA corresponds to bases 379-398, from the initiation ATG start site, a common sequence of all the three PLCs. Moreover, it is important to take into account that the nuclear location of PLCβ1 is necessary to obtain the up-regulation of CD24 since both PLCβ1a and PLCβ1b splicing variants are present in the nucleus. On the contrary, when PLCβ1 expression is completely switched to the cytoplasm (M2b mutant), the up-modulation of CD24 does not take place. Here it is important to point out that endogenous PLCβ1 isoforms are still present in the nucleus when M2b mutant is overexpressed (Fig. 1). This fact clarifies the issue that forced expression of PLCβ1 in the cytoplasm does not induce down-regulation of CD24, which on the contrary takes place when PLCβ1a and -1b are knocked down (Fig. 4). Indeed, the presence of endogenous PLCβ1 isoforms gives rise to a behavior of CD24 expression identical to that of wild type cells. To elucidate the molecular basis of the up-modulation mediated by PLCβ1 of CD24, we addressed the issue of whether the CD24 gene up-regulation is exerted at the transcriptional level. For this purpose, we studied the regulation of CD24 promoter, using a reporter construct in which the promoter is placed upstream of the CAT reporter. Interestingly, we found a significant increase in the promoter activity in the PLCβ1a-overexpressing clone in comparison with the wild type clone. In both cases, the inhibition of enzyme expression by siRNA gave rise to a significant decrease of CD24 expression. Further studies are currently on the way aimed to find out whether the effect on the promoter of CD24 is dependent on the generation of the canonical second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which in turn could target the promoter itself, or whether it is dependent on a more direct interaction between PLCβ1 and CD24 promoter sequence. It is worthwhile to take into account that the CD24 promoter activity assay provides only indirect evidence that up-regulation occurs at the level of transcription. Indeed, the substrate of PLCβ1, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, has been implicated in mRNA splicing (19Osborne S.L. Thomas C.L. Gschmeissner S. Schiavo G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and inositol polyphosphates, downstream products of PLC activity, have been shown to regulate in yeast both mRNA export (20York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and transcription (21York J.D. Guo S. Odom A.R. Spiegelberg B.D. Stolz L.E. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2001; 41: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The likelihood that inositol polyphosphates could be the players acting on the CD24 promoter is hinted at by the fact that inositol phosphate kinase Ipk2 has been found to be located in nucleus (22Seeds A.M. Sandquist J.C. Spana E.P. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47222-47232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our data suggest a direct effect of nuclear PLCβ1 in the up-regulation of CD24 in murine Friend erythroleukemia cells, which can be committed to cessation of growth and to differentiation toward erythrocytes, following exposure to Me2SO. Therefore, to investigate the pattern of CD24 expression during erythroid differentiation, we compared the pattern of CD24 expression in all the clones overexpressing PLCβ1 in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm. Our results show that during erythroid differentiation of Friend cells, CD24 expression increased dramatically in the PLCβ1a- and -1b-overexpressing cell lines, whereas no changes occurred in the wild type cells nor in the cytoplasmatic mutant clone. Further evidence that the up-modulation of CD24 was dependent on the PLCβ1 expression is based on the finding that PLCβ1 silencing, obtained by siRNA, resulted in an almost complete abolition of CD24 expression. This is consistent with the notion that CD24 expression under-goes modulation during B cell differentiation (6Hough M.R. Chappel M.S. Sauvageau G. Takei F. Kay R. Humphries R.K. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 479-488PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, CD24 is overexpressed in a number of leukemias, including Burkitt's lymphoma and pre-B acute leukemia, and is employed to distinguish, with notable accuracy, acute from chronic leukemia or lymphomas (23Valet G. Repp R. Link H. Ehninger A. Gramatzki M.M. Cytometry. 2003; 53B: 4-10Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 24Belov L. de la Vega O. dos Remedios C.G. Mulligan S.P. Christopherson R.I. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4483-4489PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its role in differentiation, CD24 plays a role in cell adhesion, a function ascribed to the oligosaccharidic moieties that are able to interact with p-selectin (25Kadmon G. Eckert M. Sammar M. Schachner M. Altevogt P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1245-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Sammar M. Aigner S. Hubbe M. Schirrmacher V. Schachner M. Vestweber D. Altevogt P. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because of its role in cell adhesion, CD24 is more and more considered a critical molecule in the metastasizing capacities of solid tumors, including ovarian (27Kristiansen G. Denkert C. Schluns K. Dahl E. Pilarsky C. Hauptmann S. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 1215-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), colorectal tumors (28DePrimo S.E. Wong L.M. Khatry D.B. Nicholas S.L. Manning W.C. Smolich B.D. O'Farrell A.M. Cherrington J.M. BMC Cancer. 2003; 3: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), adenocarcinomas (29Friederichs J. Zeller Y. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Grone H.J. Ley K. Altevogt P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6714-6722PubMed Google Scholar), and aggressive breast cancers (30Kristiansen G. Winzer K.J. Mayordomo E. Bellach J. Schluns K. Denkert C. Dahl E. Pilarsky C. Altevogt P. Guski H. Dietel M. Clinical Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 4906-4913PubMed Google Scholar). In these tumors, CD24 represents a prognostic marker, generally associated with a poor prognosis, and is being evaluated as a critical marker in the follow-up of tumor chemotherapy and for a careful individualization of the most effective therapy protocols. Our results, which point at PLCβ1 nuclear signaling as a mechanism for CD24 up-modulation in murine erythroleukemia cells, raise the possibility that this mechanism is operative also in tumor cells. It is worth mentioning that CD24 antigen, as well as its promoter, are specifically expressed in small cell lung cancer but little expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (31Pass M.K. Quintini G. Zarn J.A. Zimmermann S.M. Sigrist J.A. Stahel R.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PLCβ1 is more abundant in small cell lung cancer than in non-small cell lung cancer (32Strassheim D. Shafer S.H. Phelps S.H. Williams C.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2730-2736PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of nuclear PLCβ1 signaling on the expression of a surface marker such as CD24, which is important in the early steps of erythroid differentiation (5Wenger R.H. Ayane M. Bose R. Kohler G. Nielsen P.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Hough M.R. Chappel M.S. Sauvageau G. Takei F. Kay R. Humphries R.K. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 479-488PubMed Google Scholar), appears interesting because of the role played by nuclear PLCβ1 in this process (3Martelli A.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 101: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Faenza I. Matteucci A. Manzoli L. Billi A.M. Aluigi M. Peruzzi D. Vitale M. Castorina S. Suh P.G. Cocco L. J. Biol.

Cocco L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The evidence that the deletion of PLCβ1 gene is linked to the progression of myelodysplastic syndrome to acute myeloid leukemia in humans (16Lo Vasco V.R. Calabrese G. Manzoli L. Palka G. Spadano A. Morizio E. Guanciali-Franchi P. Fantasia D. Cocco L. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 2004; 18: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) strengthens this contention. Altogether our findings, obtained by combining microarrays, phenotypic analysis, and siRNA technology, identify CD24 as an effector of nuclear PLCβ1 signaling pathway in murine erythroleukemia cells and reinforce the notion that nuclear PLCβ1 is a key player in erythroid differentiation (33Cocco L. Manzoli L. Barnabei O. Gilmour R.S. Martelli A.M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2003; 43: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We are grateful to Peter J. Nielsen for the generous gift of the two CAT reporter plasmids containing CD24 promoter sequence and CD24 promoter sequence in the inverse orientation."
https://openalex.org/W2010405859,"The binding of plasminogen activators and plasminogen to the cell surface results in the rapid generation of the serine protease plasmin. Plasmin is further degraded by an autoproteolytic reaction, resulting in the release of an angiostatin, A61 (Lys78–Lys468). Previously, we demonstrated that the annexin A2-S100A10 heterotetramer (AIIt) stimulates the release of A61 from plasmin by promoting the autoproteolytic cleavage of the Lys468–Gly469 bond and reduction of the plasmin Cys462–Cys541 disulfide (Kwon, M., Caplan, J. F., Filipenko, N. R., Choi, K. S., Fitzpatrick, S. L., Zhang, L., and Waisman, D. M. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 10903–10911). Mechanistically, it was unclear if AIIt promoted a conformational change in plasmin, resulting in contortion of the plasmin disulfide, or directly reduced the plasmin disulfide. In the present study, we show that AIIt thiols are oxidized during the reduction of plasmin disulfides, establishing that AIIt directly participates in the reduction reaction. Incubation of HT1080 cells with plasminogen resulted in the rapid loss of thiol-specific labeling of AIIt by 3-(N-maleimidopropionyl)biocytin. The plasminogen-dependent oxidation of AIIt could be attenuated by thioredoxin. Thioredoxin reductase catalyzed the transfer of electrons from NADPH to the oxidized thioredoxin, thus completing the flow of electrons from NADPH to AIIt. Therefore, we identify AIIt as a substrate of the thioredoxin system and propose a new model for the role of AIIt in the redox-dependent processing of plasminogen and generation of an angiostatin at the cell surface.

Therefore, we identify AIIt as a substrate of the thioredoxin system and propose a new model for the role of AIIt in the redox-dependent processing of plasminogen and generation of an angiostatin at the cell surface. The plasmin(ogen) system consists of five major components (reviewed in Refs. 1Plow E.F. Hoover-Plow J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 2Ellis V.

First, plasminogen, a single chain inactive zymogen, consists of two functional regions, the kringle-containing domains and the catalytic site (5Castellino F.J. McCance S.G. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 212: 46-60PubMed Google Scholar). The kringle domains are protein-protein interaction domains that interact with the C-terminal lysines of cell-surface plasminogen receptors. Second, the plasminogen activators, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) 1The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; AIIt, annexin A2-S100A10 heterotetramer; Pgcd, catalytically deficient plasminogen; Trxcd, cata lytically deficient thioredoxin-1; MPB, 3-(N-maleimidopropionyl)biocytin; DPBS, Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TPBS, Tween 20/phosphate-buffered saline; sulfo-NHS-biotin, sulfosuccinimidobiotin 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate. and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), are highly specific serine proteases that cleave plasminogen into the two-chain active enzyme plasmin. tPA mediates mainly intravascular thrombolysis, whereas uPA is involved in pericellular proteolysis during cell migration, wound healing, and tissue remodeling. Third, the inhibitors of plasminogen activators consist of four proteins, PAI-1, PAI-2, PAI-3, and nexin. These inhibitors form stoichiometric complexes with the plasminogen activators, resulting in the loss of plasminogen activator activity. Fourth, the uPA receptor is a 55–60-kDa glycoprotein that is anchored in the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety (6Blasi F. Carmeliet P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Increased uPA activity has been shown to be correlated with tumor invasiveness and to be a prognostic indicator of disease recurrence and metastasis in multiple types of cancer (14Duffy M.J. Clin.

Fifth, the plasminogen receptors consist of a group of cell-surface protein and nonprotein molecules that bind plasminogen with low affinity (Kd = 0.3–2 μm) and high capacity (104 to 107 binding sites/cell). Interestingly, although many plasminogen receptors have been identified, only a small subset of cellular plasminogen receptors, those that possess a C-terminal lysine residue and are co-localized with the plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator receptor complex, participate in cell-surface plasminogen activation (reviewed in Refs. 16Herren T.

Once formed, cell-surface plasmin must be tightly regulated to avoid inappropriate extracellular proteolysis and cellular damage. For example, plasmin produced at the cell surface and released into the extracellular milieu is rapidly inactivated by the plasmin inhibitor α2-antiplasmin (32Longstaff C. Gaffney P.J.

In addition, plasmin undergoes an autoproteolytic reaction, resulting in the cleavage and inactivation of the molecule (35Jespersen J. Gram J. Astrup T. Thromb.

Interestingly, several fragments produced by the plasmin autoproteolytic reaction are biologically active and possess anti-angiogenic activity (36Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J.

AIIt is anchored to the plasma membrane as a result of the interaction of the annexin A2 subunit with the plasma membrane lipids. The S100A10 subunit protrudes away from the membrane into the extracellular medium (46Lambert O. Cavusoglu N. Gallay J. Vincent M. Rigaud J.L. Henry J.P. Ayala-Sanmartin J. J. Biol.

Although the C-terminal lysines of S100A10 form tPA- and plasminogen-binding sites, the location of the plasmin-binding site is unknown. In contrast to the S100A10 subunit, the annexin A2 subunit does not bind tPA or plasminogen, but binds plasmin (Kd = 0.78 μm) (48MacLeod T.J. Kwon M. Filipenko N.R. Waisman D.M. J. Biol.

The mechanism by which plasminogen is converted to angiostatin(s) is controversial (reviewed in Ref. 39Kwon M. Waisman D.M. Waisman D.M. Plasminogen: Structure, Activation Regulation. Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York2003: 135-156Google Scholar). We proposed a novel mechanism in which AIIt regulates the conversion of plasminogen to an angiostatin, A61 (51Kwon M. Caplan J.F.

Initially, we showed that AIIt stimulates the plasminogen activator-dependent conversion of plasminogen to plasmin (20Kassam G. Choi K.S. Ghuman J. Kang H-M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Zackson T. Zackson S.

Most recently, we demonstrated that AIIt stimulates both the autoproteolytic cleavage of plasmin at the Lys468–Gly469 bond and the reduction of the plasmin Cys462–Cys541 disulfide (38Kassam G. Kwon M. Yoon C-S. Graham K.S. Young M.K. Gluck S. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8924-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 51Kwon M. Caplan J.F.

The reduction of the Cys462–Cys541 disulfide, which allowed classification of AIIt as a plasmin reductase, is particularly important in the regulation of A61 formation because this reaction is necessary to release A61 from the proteolyzed plasmin molecule. However, it was unclear if the thiols of AIIt directly participated in the plasmin reduction reaction or if the conformational change induced in plasminogen by AIIt caused an increase in the dihedral strain energy of the plasmin disulfides and opportunistic attack of these disulfide(s) by hydroxyl ions. The latter mechanism has been suggested for the thiol-independent reductase activity of phosphoglycerate kinase (53Lay A.J. Jiang X.M. Daly E. Sun L. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9062-9068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we have further characterized the plasmin reductase activity of AIIt and show that AIIt thiols directly participate in the reduction of plasmin disulfides. We show that incubation of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells with plasminogen results in the rapid oxidation of AIIt. The oxidation of AIIt is dependent on the generation of plasmin, as the formation of catalytically deficient plasmin at the cell surface fails to oxidize AIIt. We also show that oxidized AIIt is reduced by the thioredoxin system. This work is the first direct demonstration of the participation of AIIt in the redox-dependent processing of plasminogen at the cell surface and also identifies AIIt as a new substrate for the thioredoxin system. Materials—HT1080, DU145, and PC-3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Transfected HT1080 cells were prepared as described (54Choi K.S. Fogg D.K. Yoon C-S. Waisman D.M.

Dialysis of Proteins Used in the Reaction—After purification or reconstitution, AIIt, thioredoxin, protein-disulfide isomerase, and phosphoglycerate kinase were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 140 mm NaCl under argon gas to prevent possible oxidation. Detection of Free Thiols in Extracellular Annexin A2 and S100A10 — Cultured HT1080, DU145, and PC-3 cell monolayers were washed five times with Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) containing 0.1 g/liter CaCl2, 0.2 g/liter KCl, 0.2 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.1 g/liter MgCl2, 8 g/liter NaCl, 2.16 g/liter Na2HPO4, 1 g/liter d-glucose, and 0.33 mm g/liter sodium pyruvate and scraped. All DPBS solutions used for this procedure were dialyzed under argon gas, and cells were incubated with rotating. The scraped cells were incubated with DPBS, 1 μm plasminogen in DPBS, or 1 μm Pgcd mutant in DPBS for the indicated times. Then, 100 μm MPB was added to each incubation mixture, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and then incubated with 200 μm reduced glutathione at room temperature for 30 min.

In some experiments, the scraped cells were incubated with DPBS or 1 μm plasminogen at 37 °C for 30 min. Each incubation mixture was then divided into five portions, and each portion was incubated with DPBS, 1 μm thioredoxin, 5 μm thioredoxin, 1 μm Trxcd mutant, or 5 μm Trxcd mutant at 37 °C for 1 h. Then, 100 μm MPB was added to each incubation mixture, and the same procedures as described above were followed.

Plasmin Reductase Assay—Plasminogen (4 μm) was incubated with uPA (0.075 μm) and various combinations of AIIt, thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, NADPH, HT1080-conditioned medium, glutathione, or cysteine in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 140 mm NaCl at 37 °C for the indicated times. To label any free thiol groups of produced protein(s), the reaction mixture was incubated with 100 μm MPB at room temperature for 30 min. Then, the reaction mixture was diluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin as indicated below.

In the case of MPB-reacted protein samples, the membrane was blocked and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 0.1 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin in TPBS with 5% skim milk. The membrane was extensively washed with TPBS and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Thioredoxin Reductase Assay—NADPH oxidation coupled to thioredoxin reduction was monitored at 30 °C as a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm using a Hewlett-Packard Model 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostable cell holder and a multicell transport. The assay was carried out in a 200-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 200 μm NADPH, 50 nm thioredoxin reductase, 3 μm wild-type thioredoxin or Trxcd mutant, 3.5 μm AIIt, 0.4 μm uPA, and 20 μm plasminogen. AIIt Is Oxidized at the Cell Surface—Previous studies have shown that incubation of cells with plasminogen results in the formation of the autoproteolytic plasminogen fragment A61 by a three-step reaction (38Kassam G.

The Cys462–Cys541 disulfide of the autoproteolyzed plasmin is then cleaved, resulting in the release of A61 (Lys78–Lys468).

We have therefore produced a recombinant substrate, substituted with keratan sulfate, suitable for the study of aggrecanolysis in vitro. Recombinant human G1-G2 was produced in primary bovine keratocytes using a vaccinia virus expression system. Following purification and digestion with specific hydrolases, fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis was used to confirm the presence of the monosulfated Gal-GlcNAc6S and GlcNAc6s-Gal disaccharides and the disulfated Gal6S-GlcNAc6S disaccharides of keratan sulfate. Negligible amounts of fucose or sialic acid were detected, and the level of unsulfated disaccharides was minimal. Treatment with keratanases reduced the size of the recombinant G1-G2 by ~5 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Treatment with N-glycosidase F also reduced the size of G1-G2 by ~5 kDa and substantially reduced G1-G2 immunoreactivity with monoclonal antibody 5-D-4, indicating that keratan sulfate on the recombinant protein is N-linked. Cleavage of G1-G2 by aggrecanase was markedly reduced when keratan sulfate chains were removed by treatment with keratanase, keratanase II, endo-β-galactosidase, or N-glycosidase F. These results indicate that modification of oligosaccharides in the aggrecan interglobular domain with keratan sulfate, most likely at asparagine residue 368, potentiates aggrecanase activity in this part of the core protein.

Cleavage of G1-G2 by aggrecanase was markedly reduced when keratan sulfate chains were removed by treatment with keratanase, keratanase II, endo-β-galactosidase, or N-glycosidase F. These results indicate that modification of oligosaccharides in the aggrecan interglobular domain with keratan sulfate, most likely at asparagine residue 368, potentiates aggrecanase activity in this part of the core protein."
https://openalex.org/W2096119422,"Telomerase is a specialized reverse transcriptase that extends telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes. The functional telomerase complex contains a telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit and a telomerase template RNA. We have previously demonstrated that human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) catalytic subunit is functionally compatible with a telomerase template RNA from rabbit. In this study, we show that hTERT is also functionally compatible with a telomerase template RNA from bovine. Introduction of hTERT into bovine lens epithelial cells (BLECs) provides the transfected cells telomerase activity. The expressed hTERT in BLECs supports normal growth of the transfected cells for 108 population doublings so far, and these cells are still extremely healthy in both morphology and growth. In contrast, the vector-transfected cells display growth crisis after 20 population doublings. These cells run into cellular senescence due to shortening of the telomeres and also commit differentiation as indicated by the accumulation of the differentiation markers, β-crystallin and filensin. hTERT prevents the occurrence of both events. By synthesizing new telomere, hTERT prevents replicative senescence, and through regulation of MEK/ERK, protein kinase C, and protein kinase A and eventual suppression of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, hTERT inhibits differentiation of BLECs. Our finding that hTERT can suppress RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway to prevent differentiation provides a novel mechanism to explain how hTERT regulates cell differentiation.

Telomeres have been implicated in stabilizing and protecting linear chromosomes from exonucleolytic degradation, preventing chromosome-to-chromosome fusions and recombination, anchoring chromosomes within the nucleus, and assisting the replication of linear DNA (1Blackburn E.H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10072-10076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Whether hTERT is functionally compatible with a template RNA from other vertebrates remained unknown until our recent study (28Xiang H. Wang J. Mao Y.W. Li D. W.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in which we demonstrate that hTERT can form a functional telomerase complex with a rabbit template RNA. In the present study, we further demonstrate this functional compatibility between hTERT and a template RNA from bovine. Expression of hTERT in bovine lens epithelial cells (BLEC) results in elongated telomeres and extended lifespan. Besides telomere maintenance, our previous studies have demonstrated that telomerase has other functions beyond telomere synthesis. First, overexpression of hTERT in rabbit lens epithelial cells not only yields telomerase activity but also distinctly suppresses camptothecin-induced apoptosis. The suppression of induced apoptosis by hTERT is associated with its repression of expression of the apoptotic genes including p53 and Bcl-XS but not linked to telomere synthesis (28Xiang H. Wang J. Mao Y.W. Li D. W.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Second, when introduced into human lens epithelial cells, regardless of the presence or absence of the endogenous telomerase activity, hTERT regulates the retinoblastoma (Rb)/E2F pathway to accelerate the cell growth rate (29Xiang H. Wang J. Mao Y-W. Liu M. Reddy V. Li D. W.-C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3784-3791Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that hTERT displays additional functions beyond telomere synthesis. Here we demonstrate that hTERT introduced into BLECs can suppress differentiation. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that hTERT can regulate the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway to mediate the suppression of lens epithelial cell differentiation. Thus, our studies provide evidence that hTERT regulates both proliferation and differentiation in eukaryotes. Establishment of Stable Expression Cell Lines—The hTERT expression construct, pCI-hTERT, was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Weinberg (30Kolquist K.A. Ellisen L.W. Counter C.M. Meyerson M. Tan L.K. Weinberg R.A. Haber D.A. Gerald W.L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The parallel control vector pCI-neo was purchased from Promega. The pCI-neo and pCI-hTERT were introduced into BLECs derived from primary cultures using electroporation with a BTX Electro Cell Manipulator as described previously (28Xiang H. Wang J. Mao Y.W. Li D. W.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Xiang H. Wang J. Mao Y-W. Liu M. Reddy V. Li D. W.-C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3784-3791Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Selection of individual stable expression cell clone was conducted in the corresponding medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 6 weeks. RNA Preparation and Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total cellular RNAs were extracted from 100% confluent cultures with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as previously described (31Li D. W.-C. Xiang H. Fass U. Zhang X.-Y. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2603-2609PubMed Google Scholar, 32Li D. W.-C. Xiang H. Mao Y.-W. Wang J. Fass U. Zhang X.-Y. Xu C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 266: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and 2 μg of total RNAs were used for reverse transcription in a 20-μl reaction with Superscript II (reverse transcriptase from Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2 μl of the reverse transcripts were used for PCR. To determine the expression of hTERT, semiquantitative RT-PCR was conducted using β-actin as an internal control. The primers used in this study included the following: 5′-GTGGGGCGCCCCAGGCACCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCCGATTTC-3′ (reverse) for the β-actin gene and 5′-GCTGATGAGTGTGTACGTCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCTTTTCTCTGCGGAACGT-3′ (reverse) for hTERT. PCR was run four cycles with hTERT primers alone. After β-actin primers were added into the same reaction, PCR was run an additional 30 cycles. Immunoprecipitation-linked RT-PCR—The immunoprecipitation-linked RT-PCR was conducted as previously described (28Xiang H. Wang J. Mao Y.W. Li D. W.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Total cellular proteins from both pCI-BLECs and pCI-hTERT-BLECs were extracted using 1× CHAPS lysis buffer. The anti-hTERT antibody (Alpha Diagnostic) was used to precipitate the hTERT-bTR complex from pCI-hTERT-BLEC stable expression clone. A parallel control precipitation from the pCI-BLEC clone was also conducted. 500 μg of cell extracts were mixed with 10 μg of anti-hTERT antibody and 100 units of RNasin (Promega). The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking, and then 50 μl of protein A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added into the initial reaction mixture and incubated for an additional hour under the same condition. After the incubation, the mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C and the pellet was washed three times with PBS. Following the final wash, the pellet was processed for RNA isolation using TRIzol as described above. 10 μg of Escherichia coli tRNA was added into the sample as carrier before RNA extraction. The isolated RNA was processed for RT-PCR. The primers for bovine telomerase RNA are 5′-CTGTGCTTTTGGTTACCGCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCCTTTCCCTGCGGTTACA-3′ (reverse). Cell Extract Preparation and Telomerase Activity Assay—Cellular extracts from parental BLECs, vector-transfected BLECs (pCI-BLEC), and hTERT-transfected BLECs (pCI-hTERT-BLEC) were prepared in 1× CHAPS lysis buffer and cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C (12,000 × g). These extracts were assayed for telomerase activity with a PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) (33Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6510) Google Scholar) using a kit from Intergen. Telomeric repeats were synthesized onto the oligonucleotide, TS (5′-AATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTT-3′), in an extension reaction containing each cell extract sample and run at 30 °C for 30 min. After extension, the products were amplified by PCR with [γ-32P]ATP-end-labeled TS primer and a downstream TRAP primer mixture for 30 cycles (94 °C, 30 s and 59 °C, 30 s). A 36-bp internal standard was included for each reaction. At the end of each reaction, 25 μl of the reaction products were analyzed in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Southern Blot Analysis for Telomere Length—To determine the length of telomeres in both vector- and hTERT-transfected bovine lens epithelial cells, Southern blot analysis was conducted as previously described (34Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4580) Google Scholar, 35Hastie N.D. Dempster M. Dunlop M.G. Thompson A.M. Green D.K. Allshire R.C.

Genomic DNA samples were extracted from both vector-transfected cells (pCI-BLEC) and hTERT-transfected cells (pCI-hTERT-BLEC). 10 volumes of extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS, 20 μg/ml pancreatic RNase) were added to the cell pellet, which was resuspended by gentle pipetting. The cell suspension was incubated for 1 h at 37 °Cand then protease K was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, phenol extraction was performed for three times. The DNA was precipitated, washed, and resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes HinfI and RsaI (Promega) at 37 °C overnight and then precipitated with 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol in the presence of 20 μg of E. coli tRNA as carrier. The DNA fragments were resolved by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis at 100V for 4 h. After depurination by soaking in 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 3.0, for 30 min and denaturation twice with 1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m NaOH for 20 min, the DNA fragments were neutralized with 1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane in 10× SSC (1.5 m NaCl, 0.15 m sodium citrate). The membrane was prehybridized overnight at 40 °C in the prehybridization buffer and then hybridized with a [γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotide (TTAGGG)7 probe in the same buffer at 40 °C for 30 h and washed in moderate stringency condition three times. DNA fragments were visualized by autoradiography. Protein Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was conducted as we previously described (37Mao Y-W. Xiang H. Wang J.

Total protein was extracted from BLECs, pCI-BLECs, and pCI-hTERT-BLECs using 300 μl of extraction buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 9.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.7 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml, 30 μl/ml aprotinin with pH adjusted to 7.4). The protein concentrations were determined as described previously (40Li D. W.-C. Fass U. Huizar I. Spector A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 50 or 100 μg of total protein from each sample were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). The protein blots were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-NaCl buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) overnight at 4 °C and then incubated for 1 h with anti-hTERT (Calbiochem.), anti-ERK, anti-p-ERK, anti-MEK, anti-phospho-MEK, and anti-β-actin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PKC and anti-PKA antibodies (Pharmingen), anti-β-crystallin antibody (StressGen), and anti-filensin antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:500–2000 (μg/ml) in 5% milk prepared in Tris-NaCl buffer. The secondary antibody was anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG, or anti-goat IgG (determined by primary antibodies) at a dilution of 1:1000–2000 (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactivity was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) according to the company's instructions. Overexpression of PKA, PKC, and MEK and Inhibition of PKA, PKC, and RAF/MEK/ERK Signaling Pathways with Pharmacological Inhibitor or Dominant Negative Mutants—The expression vectors of pCMV-PKAα and pCMV-MEK were obtained from the Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The PKCα expression vector, pCMV-PKCα, and its dominant negative mutant (DNM), pCMV-DNM PKCα, were kind gifts of Dr. Zigang Dong (University of Minnesota). The PKA-specific inhibitor, H-89 (Ki = 48 nm for PKA), was purchased from Calbiochem. Both vector- and hTERT-transfected BLECs were treated with 250 nm H-89 for 24 h before the treated cells were harvested for analysis. H-89 does not inhibit other kinases at the concentration used. The RAF and RAS dominant negative mutants (41Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 42Mischak H.

Both overexpression and DNM constructs were amplified in DH-5α and purified using the Plasmid Maxiprep kit from Bio-Rad (catalog number 732-6130). Transfection of pCI-BLECs and pCI-hTERT-BLECs was conducted with Lipofectamine 2000 from Invitrogen according to the company instruction manual. Expression levels of each construct in the transfected cells were monitored with Western blot analysis. Cell Growth Assay—To determine the cell growth rate, an equal number of cells from different cell lines were seeded in 6-well plates at day 0. The medium was replaced every 2 days, and the cells in each well were collected by trypsinization and counted using hemocytometer in triplicate in an interval of 24 h for 5 days. Senescence-associated-β-Galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) Assay—SA-β-Gal assay was used to determine cellular senescence. Senescent cells express a higher level of lysosomal β-galactosidase activity detectable in the presence of X-gal at pH 6.0, which forms a local blue precipitate upon cleavage (43Dimri G.P. Lee X.

The media then were removed, and the cells in each chamber were washed with PBS twice followed by fixation with 3% formaldehyde for 5 min. After fixation, the cells in each chamber were washed with PBS twice and then incubated for 12 h with fresh SA-β-Gal staining solution (1 mg/ml X-gal, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mm MgCl2 in PBS) (43Dimri G.P.

Open table in a new tab Quantitation of the Total Protein and Kinase Activity Levels—For quantitative comparison, some of the x-ray films were analyzed with the automated digitizing system from the Silk Scientific Corporation. Total pixel data were averaged from three experiments after normalization against the background and β-actin. The Establishment of the hTERT-Expression Bovine Lens Epithelial Cell Line—We have previously demonstrated that hTERT is functionally compatible with the telomerase RNA from rabbit (28Xiang H. Wang J. Mao Y.W. Li D. W.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To further confirm the functional compatibility between hTERT and other vertebrate TR, we have introduced the hTERT into BLEC derived from primary cultures. The primary cultures of BLECs were established from intact bovine lens organ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These cells lack detectable telomerase activity as demonstrated by TRAP assay (Fig. 1C, left lane). After introduction of either the vector, pCI-neo, or the hTERT expression construct, pCI-hTERT, into BLECs, the cells underwent a 6-week selection in the presence of 600 μg/ml G418. Thereafter, the stable clones either carrying only the vector or expressing hTERT were obtained. Fig. 1A showed the morphology of a 100% confluent culture of one of the hTERT expression lines (pCI-hTERT-BLEC-C1). RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of hTERT in this line and another line (pCI-hTERT-BLEC-C2). As shown in Fig. 1B, top panel, the 309-bp hTERT DNA band amplified from hTERT mRNA was detected only in the two clones of hTERT-transfected BLECs but not in ve"
https://openalex.org/W2055852936,"Tyrosine phosphorylation plays a critical role in many regulatory aspects of cellular signaling, and dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine residues is crucial for termination of signals initiated by tyrosine kinases. Previous work has shown that the tyrosine kinase Src phosphorylates Tyr644 on phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type I (PIPKI) γ661 in a focal adhesion kinase-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of this residue is essential for high affinity binding of PIPKIγ661 to the focal adhesion protein talin and for targeting of PIPKIγ661 to focal adhesions. A yeast two-hybrid screen performed with the C-terminal 178-amino acid tail of PIPKIγ661 identified an interaction with the phosphatase domain of the tyrosine phosphatase Shp-1. The interaction between PIPKIγ661 and Shp-1 was confirmed via co-immunoprecipitation from HEK293 cell lysates. In addition, Src-phosphorylated PIPKIγ661 is a substrate for Shp-1, and Shp-1 modulates both the association between PIPKIγ661 and talin and the targeting of PIPKIγ661 to focal adhesions in mammalian cells. Finally, we showed that Shp-1 phosphatase activity is inhibited by the product of PIPKIγ661, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, in vitro. These combined results suggest a model in which the reciprocal actions of Src tyrosine kinase and Shp-1 tyrosine phosphatase dynamically regulate the association between PIPKIγ661 and talin.

Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is an important regulatory mechanism for numerous signaling pathways in cells (1Mustelin T. Feng G.S. Bottini N. Alonso A. Kholod N. Birle D. Merlo J. Huynh H. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d85-d142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hunter T. Keio J. Med. 2002; 51: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These pathways are initiated by the catalytic action of tyrosine kinases. One of the many roles for phosphotyrosine residues generated by these kinases is to serve as docking sites for phosphotyrosine binding domain- and Src homology 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology 2; PIPKI, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type I; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FA, focal adhesion; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PI4,5P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; p-NPP, p-nitrophenylphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. domain-containing proteins. Not only does this target SH2 domain-containing proteins to these sites but, in many cases, the association modulates the activity of the assembled protein. Termination of these signaling pathways then occurs via dephosphorylation by tyrosine phosphatases. At least 107 genes have been identified as coding for protein tyrosine phosphatases, and they have been subdivided into four distinct classes (3Alonso A. Sasin J. Bottini N. Friedberg I. Osterman A. Godzik A. Hunter T. Dixon J. Mustelin T. Cell. 2004; 117: 699-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain-containing phosphatase Shp-1 and its functionally distinct homologue, Shp-2, are members of the class 1 nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatases. These phosphatases have two tandem SH2 domains at their N termini that serve as regulators of catalytic activity (4Barford D. Neel B.G. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 5Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Shp-1 has typically been regarded as a negative regulator of cellular functions, whereas Shp-2 has been found to serve a more positive role in signaling (6Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Study of Shp-1 function has been greatly aided by the discovery of the motheaten (me) and motheaten viable (mev) allele mutant phenotypes observed in mice (7Kozlowski M. Mlinaric-Rascan I. Feng G.S. Shen R. Pawson T. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 8Zhang J. Somani A.K. Siminovitch K.A. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 361-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The name is derived from the phenotypic patchy hair loss resulting from the formation of dermal abscesses. These mice exhibit severe defects in control of hematopoietic cell development and proliferation (8Zhang J. Somani A.K. Siminovitch K.A. Semin.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1445-1454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Increased extracellular matrix adherence and significant deficiencies in cell motility have also been observed in macrophages and neutrophils derived from these mice (10Roach T.I. Slater S.E.

Numerous other functions have been identified for Shp-1, including roles in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, regulation of the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription pathway, apoptosis, and inhibitory immunoreceptor signaling (6Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 12Yousefi S. Simon H.U. Semin.

Kim M.K. Indik Z.K. Schreiber A.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recently, Shp-1 has been linked to regulation of actin dynamics via dephosphorylation of both actin filaments and the actin cross-linker α-actinin (15Lin S.Y. Raval S. Zhang Z. Deverill M. Siminovitch K.A. Branch D.R. Haimovich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25755-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Baba T. Fusaki N. Shinya N. Iwamatsu A. Hozumi N. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3762-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKIs) are also key modulators of the actin cytoskeleton. These enzymes generate the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2), which serves as an important regulator of the actin cytoskeleton by directly stimulating proteins involved in actin polymerization, such as N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex, while inhibiting actin-severing proteins, such as gelsolin (17Yin H.L. Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 761-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Structures important for cellular adhesion and migration known as focal adhesions (FAs) are also highly linked to the actin cytoskeleton. Similarly, PI4,5P2 is also a major regulator in several aspects of FA signaling (18Sechi A.S. Wehland J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113 (Pt 21): 3685-3695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Anderson R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 194: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Previously, PIPKIγ661 was shown to be specifically targeted to FAs via a direct association with the FA scaffolding protein talin (20Di Paolo G. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R. Voronov S. Chang S. Guo J. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Nature. 2002; 420: 8589Crossref Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 21Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This is thought to result in generation of a highly localized pool of PI4,5P2 at FAs. PI4,5P2 may then facilitate integrin activation via direct modulation of the talin band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin homology domain, resulting in enhanced binding of talin to β1 integrin (22Martel V. Racaud-Sultan C. Dupe S. Marie C. Paulhe F. Galmiche A. Block M.R. Albiges-Rizo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21217-21227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Elucidating the underlying mechanism for targeting of PIPKIγ661 to talin is key for understanding how FAs may be activated by PI4,5P2. PIPKIγ661 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src on Tyr644 of its C terminus (23Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation event results in a dramatic increase in the affinity of PIPKIγ661 for talin and subsequently stimulates phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase activity (20Di Paolo G. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R. Voronov S. Chang S. Guo J. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Nature. 2002; 420: 8589Crossref Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 21Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). However, no phosphatase has yet been identified that provides a mechanism for the dephosphorylation of PIPKIγ661. Here we report that Shp-1 directly interacts with PIPKIγ and dephosphorylates PIPKIγ661 both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, we show that Shp-1 may be regulated by PI4,5P2 and that expression of Shp-1 in mammalian cells results in attenuation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-mediated enhancement of the PIPKIγ661-talin association and disruption of PIPKIγ661 targeting to FAs. Murine PIPKIγ661, PIPKIγ635, and kinase-dead PIPKIγ661 (PIPKIγ661kd) mammalian and bacterial expression vectors were described previously (21Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 23Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The 483x C-terminal truncation of PIPKIγ661 was generated by introducing a stop codon in place of amino acid Glu483 using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol using the following mutagenic primer and its complement: 5′-CCCGATCCCCAGCGAGAGATAAGATGTGCAGTATGACC. The Shp-1 open reading frame was cloned by PCR from Open Biosystems cDNA (GenBank™ accession number BC002523) using primers that incorporated a 5′ EcoRI restriction site (5′-ATAGAATTCATGCTGTCCCGTGGGTGG) and a 3′ XhoI restriction site (5′-GGCATACTCGAGTCACTTCCTCTTGAGGG). The resulting PCR fragment was then subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen), pET28, and pET42 (Novagen) expression vectors. The Shp-1 C455S mutant was made via QuikChange using the following mutagenic primer and its complement: 5′-CCATCATCGTGCACTCCAGCGCCGGCATCG. The Shp-1 SH2 domain truncation construct was made by mutation of residue Tyr278 into a stop codon using the QuikChange method and the following mutagenic primer and its complement: 5′-GGGCAAGAACCGCTAAAAGAACATTCTCCCC. The following Shp-1 truncations were made in the same fashion with the following mutagenic primers and their complements: 560x, 5′-CCTCCCGCACCTCGTCCTAACACAAGGAGG; 529x, 5′-GCTGGAGGTCCTGTAGTCGCAGAAGGGCC; 502x, 5′-CGGGCATGGTGTAGACGGAGGCGC; 427x, 5′-GGGGTCCCCAGTTAGCCTGGGGGTGTCC; and 379x, 5′-CGTGCTTATGGGCCCTAATCTGTGACCAACTGC. The Shp-1 phosphatase domain truncation was generated by digestion of the Shp-1 open reading frame with SmaI and XhoI. The resulting fragment was subcloned into pET42b using EcoRV and XhoI restriction sites. Shp-2 was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from HeLa mRNA isolated with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions using primers that incorporated a 5′ BamHI restriction site (5′-CGGGATCCGCCACCATGACATCGCGGAGATGG) and a 3′ XhoI restriction site (5′-GCCTCGAGTCATCTGAAACTTTTCTGCTGTTGC). The resulting fragment was subcloned into the pCMV-Tag3B (Stratagene) expression vector. The c-Src- and HA-tagged FAK mammalian expression constructs were gifts from Dr. Patricia J. Keely (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). The c-Src open reading frame was cloned by PCR from the mammalian expression vector using primers that incorporated a 5′ NcoI restriction site (5′-ATCCATGGGGAGCAGCAAGAGCAAGC) and a 3′ BamHI restriction site (5′-ATGGATCCCTATAGGTTCTCTCCAGGCTGG). The resulting fragment was subcloned into the pALTER-Ex2 (Promega) bacterial expression vector. HEK293 cells and NRK cells were cultured using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. NRK cells were plated on glass coverslips and transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then used for immunofluorescence 16 h after transfection. HEK293 cells were transfected via calcium phosphate with 2 μg of each expression vector. The cells were used for immunoprecipitation 48 h after transfection. Stable NRK cells expressing PIPKIγ661 were generated by transfection with PIPKIγ661 using FuGENE 6. Stably transfected cells were selected via neomycin resistance by supplementing the media with 1 mg/ml Geneticin G418 sulfate (Invitrogen) and subcloned by serial dilution. Monoclonal mouse anti-Shp-1 (52) was obtained from BD Biosciences. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Shp-1 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and anti-Src (EC10) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Monoclonal mouse anti-HA (16B12) was obtained from Covance. Monoclonal mouse anti-talin (8d4) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-GST antibody was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-T7 antibody was obtained from Novagen. Polyclonal PIPKIγ rabbit anti-serum was generated and purified as described previously (21Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and subsequently resuspended and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2 supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Cell lysates were incubated with 50 μl of 1:1 diluted protein A-Sepharose and 2 μg of the specified antibody as indicated at 4 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes were extensively washed, separated by 7.5% or 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore Corp.). Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used for visualization on x-ray film (RPI Corp.). Constructs in pET28 or pET42 expression vectors were transformed into BL21 (DE3) competent cells (Novagen). Proteins were expressed and purified using His-Bind Resin following the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen) or using glutathione-Sepharose 4B Fast Flow as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant T7-tagged PIPKIγ661 was incubated with GST-Shp-1 together with glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences) in 500 μl of buffer B (PBS, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) for 4 h or overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 1 ml of buffer B four times, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed via Western blot. GST was used as a control for nonspecific binding. All other GST pull-down assays were performed with the proteins indicated in the same manner. Bacterial expression constructs for His-tagged PIPKIγ661 or PIPKIγ635 (pET28) were co-transformed with c-Src expression vector (pALTER-Ex2) into BL21 (DE3) competent cells (Novagen). The phosphorylated PIPKIγ proteins were expressed and then purified with His-Bind Resin following the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). PIPKIγ661 was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells co-transfected with PIPKIγ661 and c-Src. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice in immunoprecipitation buffer and twice in phosphatase buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). The immunoprecipitates were then split equally into two tubes for treatment with Shp-1 or mock treatment. Treatment consisted of addition of 2 μg of Shp-1 to the immunoprecipitate and incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The reactions were then quenched with SDS sample buffer, boiled, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Bacterially expressed, c-Src-phosphorylated PIPKIγ was dephosphorylated in phosphatase buffer in the same manner. NRK cells were washed with PBS at room temperature 16 h after transfection, fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 15 min, and permeabilized by 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 1 h, incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C, and washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were then incubated with fluorophore-labeled secondary antibody at room temperature for 45 min and washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The coverslips were mounted to glass slides in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) mounting medium. Fluorescent images were captured using a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope with a CoolSNAP charge-coupled device camera (RS Photo-metrics) or using a ×60 Plan oil immersion lens on a confocal laser scanning microscope (model MR-1000; Bio-Rad Laboratories) mounted transversely to an inverted microscope (Diaphot 200, Nikon; W. M. Keck Laboratory for Biological Imaging, Madison, WI). Images were processed as described previously using Photoshop 8.0 (21Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Phosphatase assays were performed with 2 μg of Shp-1 dissolved in phosphatase buffer with or without lipid at a final volume of 100 μl. The reactions were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to addition of p-NPP. After 20 min, the reactions were quenched with 1 m NaOH. The amount of p-nitrophenol ion produced was assessed by absorbance at 405 nm. All phosphoinositides used in these experiments were purchased from Echelon Biosciences. The C-terminal 178 amino acids of PIPKIγ661 were previously used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen (21Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This screen identified two identical fragments of the C-terminal portion of Shp-1, which includes nearly half of the phosphatase domain. Shp-1 is expressed as three distinct splice variants: a 595-residue hematopoietic variant, a 597-residue epithelial variant, and a recently identified 624-residue “long”; variant termed Shp-1L (24Jin Y.J. Yu C.L. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28301-28307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The epithelial and hematopoietic variants differ only in the first 5 residues of their N termini. Shp-1L, however, contains an alternatively spliced exon, resulting in a distinct C terminus. The yeast two-hybrid fragment did not contain this alternative C terminus. Therefore, we focused on the epithelial (597-residue) variant of human Shp-1 for characterizing the interaction with PIPKIγ661. The direct interaction between Shp-1 and PIPKIγ661 was first confirmed via GST pull-down assays. Both proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified as either His-tagged or GST-tagged fusion proteins. His-tagged Shp-1 and GST-tagged PIPKIγ661 were incubated in the presence of glutathione-conjugated Sepharose beads. After the beads were extensively washed, His-tagged Shp-1 remained bound to the GST-tagged PIPKIγ661 but did not bind to the GST control (Fig. 1A). This result was consistent in the reciprocal experiment because His-tagged PIPKIγ661 also bound to GST-tagged Shp-1 but not to GST. Interestingly, the interaction observed in the GST pull-down assays is not dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of PIPKIγ661 because the recombinant proteins used in this experiment were not phosphorylated. We next assessed the interaction in vivo by immunoprecipitating endogenous Shp-1 from HEK293 cells and blotting for associated PIPKIγ. As seen in Fig. 1B, endogenous PIPKIγ was associated with Shp-1 immunoprecipitates but was not significantly detected in the normal mouse IgG control. We further confirmed these results by co-expressing Shp-1 and PIPKIγ661 in HEK293 cells. Shp-1 was immunoprecipitated with PIPKIγ661 using a polyclonal antibody specific for the C terminus of PIPKIγ661 (Fig. 1C). The reciprocal experiment yielded similar results because PIPKIγ661 was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody specific for Shp-1. Neither protein was immunoprecipitated with normal mouse or rabbit IgG. These results and those observed in the GST pull-down experiments independently confirm a direct interaction between Shp-1 and PIPKIγ661. However, nonspecific binding of phosphatases is often problematic in immunoprecipitation experiments. Therefore, as an additional control, we co-expressed the highly homologous tyrosine phosphatase, Shp-2, with PIPKIγ661 in HEK293 cells. Under identical conditions, Shp-2 was not co-immunoprecipitated with PIPKIγ661 (Fig. 2A). This result indicates that the interaction between Shp-1 and PIPKIγ661 is quite specific. These experiments, however, did not address the specific regions involved in the interaction between Shp-1 and PIPKIγ661. Because PIPKIγ is also expressed as a shorter splice variant, PIPKIγ635, we performed co-immunoprecipitations using both splice variants. Our results indicate that PIPKIγ635 is also capable of binding to Shp-1 (Fig. 2A) because both splice variants were immunoprecipitated with Shp-1. Additionally, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase activity does not appear to be required for this interaction because the kinase-dead PIPKIγ661 (Fig. 2A, Iγ661 KD) was immunoprecipitated with Shp-1 at levels similar to the wild-type enzyme. Because the yeast two-hybrid screen indicated that the last 178 amino acids of PIPKIγ661 were sufficient for binding Shp-1, we focused on this region of PIPKIγ661 by utilizing C-terminal truncations. Using the co-immunoprecipitation approach, we co-expressed Shp-1 with PIPKIγ661, PIPKIγ635, or a C-terminal truncation of the last 178 amino acids generated by mutation of Glu483 into a stop codon (Fig. 2B, Iγ483x). As shown in Fig. 2B, the results for the two splice variants of PIPKIγ were consistent with those shown in Fig. 2A. However, truncation of the last 178 amino acids of PIPKIγ661 resulted in a significant reduction of immunoprecipitated Shp-1, indicating that this region of PIPKIγ661 is necessary for efficient binding to Shp-1. A GST pull-down approach was then used to determine the specific binding site for PIPKIγ661 on Shp-1. GST fusions of full-length Shp-1, the N-terminal SH2 domains (residues 1-277), and the C-terminal phosphatase domain (residues 300-597) were first used to identify the PIPKIγ661 binding site. As seen in Fig. 2C, PIPKIγ661 preferentially binds to the C-terminal phosphatase domain of Shp-1. To refine the putative binding site, we generated a series of C-terminal Shp-1 truncations by mutating the codons encoding amino acids 560, 529, 502, 427, and 379 into stop codons. These residues were selected from regions of random coil within the Shp-1 crystal structure (25Yang J. Liu L. He D. Song X. Liang X. Zhao Z.J. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6516-6520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the truncations of Shp-1 beyond amino acid 529 were insoluble when expressed in E. coli. However, the two soluble truncations, Shp-1 560x and Shp-1 529x, bound to GST-tagged PIPKIγ661 but did not bind to GST alone (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that PIPKIγ661 binds to Shp-1 via the N-terminal portion of the phosphatase domain, which would include the active site of the phosphatase. As seen in the immunoprecipitation experiments, Shp-2 was not capable of binding to GST-tagged PIPKIγ661, further demonstrating that the interaction between Shp-1 and PIPKIγ661 is specific. Phosphorylated PIPKIγ661 Is a Substrate for Shp-1 Both in Vivo and in Vitro—PIPKIγ661 becomes strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated upon adhesion to extracellular matrix ligands such as type I collagen, and we have previously shown that Src phosphorylates Tyr644 of PIPKIγ661 in a FAK-dependent manner (21Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 23Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether Shp-1 is capable of dephosphorylating PIPKIγ661. Co-expression of c-Src with PIPKIγ661 in HEK293 cells results in a strong tyrosine phosphorylation of PIPKIγ661, as demonstrated by Western blot using a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (Fig. 3A). However, co-expression of Shp-1 with c-Src and PIPKIγ661 significantly attenuated the level of PIPKIγ661 tyrosine phosphorylation. The catalytically inactive mutant (C455S) of Shp-1, when co-expressed in a similar manner, has no effect on the phosphorylation level of PIPKIγ661. PIPKIγ661 is tyrosine-phosphorylated when expressed alone in HEK293 cells, although to a much lower extent than when it is co-expressed with c-Src, and co-expression with Shp-1 also dephosphorylates PIPKIγ661 under this condition (data not shown). These combined results suggest that Shp-1 dephosphorylates PIPKIγ661 in vivo and that expression of Shp-1 attenuates Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of PIPKIγ661 in HEK293 cells. To confirm that Shp-1 is capable of dephosphorylating PIPKIγ661, phosphorylated PIPKIγ661 was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells co-transfected with PIPKIγ661 and c-Src and used as a substrate for phosphatase assays. After washing with phosphatase buffer, the immunoprecipitates were either mock-treated or treated with recombinant Shp-1 phosphatase. As seen in Fig. 3B, Shp-1 dephosphorylated PIPKIγ661 in vitro, whereas mock-treated PIPKIγ661 remained strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated. To ensure that these results were due to direct dephosphorylation by Shp-1, we expressed recombinant phosphorylated PIPKIγ via co-expression of PIPKIγ661 or PIPKIγ635 with c-Src in E. coli. The purified phosphorylated PIPKIγ was then mock-treated or treated with Shp-1 in vitro in the same manner used with immunoprecipitated PIPKIγ661. The results were similar because Shp-1 was able to effectively dephosphorylate PIPKIγ661 (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, PIPKIγ635 was weakly phosphorylated upon co-expression with c-Src in bacteria, which has also been observed in mammalian cells (data not shown). This result indicates that residues other than Tyr644 may be phosphorylated by c-Src under these conditions and that Shp-1 may be able to dephosphorylate other tyrosine-phosphorylated residues within the C terminus of PIPKIγ. Shp-1 Attenuates the FAK-mediated Association between PIPKIγ661 and Talin—We have shown that FAK signaling via Src results in a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation level of PIPKIγ661 in our previous work (21Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 23Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This increased level of phosphorylation leads to a corresponding increase in the affinity of PIPKIγ661 for talin, which has been observed both in vivo and in vitro. To determine whether Shp-1 might play a role in regulation of this association in vivo, we co-expressed PIPKIγ661, FAK, and phosphatase-active or-inactive Shp-1 in HEK293 cells. Upon co-expression with FAK, PIPKIγ661 becomes strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated and binds to talin with much higher affinity (Fig. 4), which is consistent with our previous results (21Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 23Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F.

The disintegrin, cysteine-rich, and EGF-like fragments have been shown previously to support cell adhesion via activated integrins or proteoglycans. In this study, we report that the entire extracellular domain of mouse ADAM12 produced in Drosophila S2 cells supported efficient adhesion and spreading of C2C12 myoblasts even in the absence of exogenous integrin activators. This adhesion was not mediated by β1 integrins or proteoglycans, was myoblast-specific, and required the presence of both the metalloprotease and disintegrin/cysteine-rich domains of ADAM12. Analysis of the recombinant proteins by far-UV circular dichroism suggested that the secondary structures of the autonomously expressed metalloprotease domain and the disintegrin/cysteine-rich/EGF-like domains differ from the structures present in the intact extracellular domain. Furthermore, the intact extracellular domain (but not the metalloprotease domain or the disintegrin/cysteine-rich/EGF-like fragment alone) decreased the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and myogenin, two markers of differentiation, and inhibited C2C12 myoblast fusion. Thus, the novel protein-protein interaction reported here involving the extracellular domain of ADAM12 may have important biological consequences during myoblast differentiation.

Kuschel R. Fujisawa-Sehara A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have shown that, during myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells in vitro, ADAM12 expression is down-regulated in differentiated myotubes, but is maintained in a pool of non-differentiated “reserve” cells with a G0-like phenotype, characterized by increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 and the retinoblastoma-related protein p130 and down-regulation of MyoD (29Cao Y. Zhao Z. Gruszczynska-Biegala J. Zolkiewska A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6725-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, higher expression of ADAM12 in a pool of MyoD-negative cells compared with MyoD-positive cells has also been observed during differentiation of human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (30Sundberg C.

Inhibition of ADAM12 expression by small interfering RNA is accompanied by lower expression levels of G0 markers, whereas forced expression of ADAM12 induces a G0-like phenotype (29Cao Y. Zhao Z. Gruszczynska-Biegala J. Zolkiewska A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6725-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, we re-evaluate the adhesive properties of the extracellular domain of ADAM12 and its effect on myoblast differentiation. We show that the recombinant extracellular domain of mouse ADAM12 produced in Drosophila S2 cells supports C2C12 cell adhesion in the absence of Mn2+. The presence of both the metalloprotease and disintegrin/cysteine-rich domains was necessary for efficient cell adhesion. Structural analysis of the recombinant proteins by circular dichroism indicated that two complementary fragments of the extracellular domain of ADAM12, i.e. the metalloprotease domain and the disintegrin/cysteine-rich/epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; aa, amino acids; wt, wild-type; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. -like region, assumed different folding when produced as autonomous proteins or as parts of the larger extracellular domain. The Mn2+-independent adhesion, which did not seem to be mediated by β1 integrins or proteoglycans, appeared to be muscle-specific and was not observed in non-myoblastic cell lines. Finally, a potential significance of the novel protein-protein interaction reported here is validated by the fact that the entire extracellular domain (but not the metalloprotease domain or the disintegrin/cysteine-rich/EGF-like fragment alone) inhibited myoblast differentiation. Expression Constructs—The cDNA fragments encoding the extracellular domain of ADAM12 (X, amino acids (aa) 32–707); the prodomain, metalloprotease domain, and disintegrin and cysteine-rich region (MDC, aa 32–657); the prodomain and metalloprotease domain (M, aa 32–421); the disintegrin, cysteine-rich, and EGF-like domains (DCE, aa 422–706); and the disintegrin and cysteine-rich region (DC, aa 422–657) were amplified by PCR using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase and the mouse full-length Adam12 cDNA as a template. For expression in Drosophila S2 cells, the cDNA fragments were cloned into the pMT/BiP/V5-HisA vector between the BglII and NotI sites in-frame with the BiP secretion signal present in the vector. The E349Q mutation, which abolishes the catalytic activity of the metalloprotease, was introduced into the X, MDC, and M constructs using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). In addition, the cDNA fragments encoding the DCE, DC, and CbE (the b subdomain of the cysteine-rich region and the EGF-like domain, aa 559–706) constructs were cloned into pET20b vector between the NdeI and NotI sites for bacterial expression. All of the insect and bacterial expression constructs (see Fig. 1) contained a sequence encoding a His6 tag at the C termini of the corresponding proteins. For expression in mammalian cells, the following constructs were prepared: XT-wt (aa 1–734, corresponding to the extracellular domain, the transmembrane domain, and the first 7 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of ADAM12), XT (aa 1–734, containing the E349Q mutation), and ETCyt (aa 658–903, corresponding to the EGF-like, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains, preceded by the Igκ chain signal sequence). The cDNA fragments were cloned into the pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech) between the KpnI and NotI sites, replacing the entire enhanced green fluorescent protein gene with the ADAM12 fragments. Cell Culture—Drosophila S2 cells were cultured at 27 °C in Schneider's Drosophila medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. C2C12 and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12K medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. C2C12, NIH3T3, and CHO-K1 cells were maintained at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 under a humidified atmosphere. Protein Expression and Purification—Drosophila S2 cells grown in 6-well plates were cotransfected with an expression vector and pCo-blast, a selection vector, using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Stable transfectants were selected with 20 μg/ml blasticidin over a 2-week period. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm CuSO4 in stably transfected S2 cells grown in four to five 175-cm2 flasks (200–250 ml of culture medium, 2–4 × 106 cells/ml). Four days after induction, the culture medium was collected, filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and loaded onto a chelating Sepharose column (2-ml bed volume; Amersham Biosciences) at a rate of 5 ml/min. The column was washed first with 50 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), then with 50 ml of 0.5 m NaCl, and then with 5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted with 7.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 50 mm imidazole. The eluate was diluted 5-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 300 mm NaCl and directly loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (0.4-ml bed volume; Qiagen Inc.) at a rate of 1.5 ml/min. After washing the column with 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole, proteins were eluted with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole. The eluate was dialyzed against 0.1 m NaHCO3 at pH 9.0 (for cell adhesion assays) or against DMEM (for cell differentiation assays). To determine the concentration of ADAM12 fragments, purified proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and analyzed by densitometry using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Alternatively, protein concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm using the molar absorptivity calculated as described (31Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray Y. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3466) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations obtained with the two methods differed by <10%. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—The X, M, and DCE proteins purified from S2 cell culture medium were dialyzed against DPBS. CD spectra at equimolar concentrations of the X, M, and DCE proteins were obtained with a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter using a quartz cell with a 0.02-cm path length at 25 °C. The spectra obtained for the M and DCE domains were added together, and the calculated spectrum was compared with the measured spectrum of the X domain to assess whether the secondary structures of the M and DCE domains were the same when the two domains were expressed autonomously and when they were parts of the larger X domain. Cell Adhesion Assay—96-Well MaxiSorp plates (Nunc) were coated with recombinant proteins in 0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 9.0) for 12–16 h at 4 °C and then blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin in DPBS at 37 °C for 1–2 h. Cells were detached with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin and 1 mm EDTA in DPBS; sequentially washed with growth medium, DMEM, and Tyrode's buffer (5 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 12 mm NaHCO3, 150 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2); and finally resuspended in Tyrode's buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. One-hundred microliters of cell suspension was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were incubated with 1 mm MnCl2, integrin β1 function-blocking antibody Ha2/5 (Pharmingen), or integrin αvβ3 function-blocking antibody RMV-7 (Chemicon International, Inc.) at room temperature for 15 min prior to adding to wells. Unbound cells were removed by two washes with Tyrode's buffer; bound cells were fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde in DPBS for 20 min, washed twice with DPBS, and stained with 0.04% crystal violet in 20% ethanol for 5 min. Wells were then washed twice with water and treated with 100 μl of 1% SDS, and absorbance at 595 nm was measured using a Bio-Rad 680 microplate reader. Each assay point was derived from 2 to 4 wells in at least two independent experiments. Cell Survival Assay—The wells of a 96-well MaxiSorp plate were coated with the purified X domain of ADAM12, polylysine (Sigma), or Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm laminin (Invitrogen) in 0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 9.0) for 12 h at 4 °C and then blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin in DPBS for 1 h at 37 °C. C2C12 cells were detached with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin and 1 mm EDTA in DPBS and washed three time with DMEM. Cells were suspended in Tyrode's buffer and added to the wells (105 cells/well). After 1 h, unbound cells were removed, and serum-free DMEM was added to the wells. The number of viable cells was determined right after adding DMEM to the cells (time 0) or 24 h later using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega). Effect of Soluble Recombinant Proteins on Cell Differentiation— C2C12 cells cultured in 96-well plates were switched at ~90% confluence from growth medium to differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum) with or without a test protein (X, M, or DCE; each at 2 μm). After 0, 1, 2, and 3 days in differentiation medium, cellular proteins were extracted for analysis of differentiation markers by Western blotting. The extent of cell fusion was analyzed by phase-contrast microscopy using an Axiovert 200 inverted microscope. Western Blotting—Cellular proteins were extracted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 5 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 mm 1,10-phenanthroline. Cell extracts were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 30 min, and supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 3% (w/v) dry milk and 0.3% (v/v) Tween 20 in DPBS and then incubated with primary antibodies in the blocking buffer, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and detection using the West Pico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-pentahistidine (recognizing His6-tagged proteins; 1:3000 dilution; Qiagen Inc.), rabbit anti-ADAM12 cytoplasmic peptide (1:3000 dilution) (29Cao Y. Zhao Z. Gruszczynska-Biegala J. Zolkiewska A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6725-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-ADAM12 disintegrin (1:3000 dilution) (29Cao Y. Zhao Z. Gruszczynska-Biegala J. Zolkiewska A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6725-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), mouse anti-p21 (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse anti-p27 (1:1000 dilution; Pharmingen), mouse anti-p130 (1:1000 dilution; BD Biosciences), mouse anti-myogenin (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and mouse anti-tubulin (1:40,000 dilution; Sigma). Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells plated on coverslips placed in a 6-well plate were transfected with the XT-wt, XT, or ETCyt expression vector using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and incubated for 12 h in growth medium. Then, 5 × 105 untransfected cells were added to each well (to increase cell density and to achieve confluence), and cells were switched to differentiation medium. One day later, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in DPBS for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in DPBS for 5 min. The coverslips were then incubated with rabbit anti-ADAM12 antibody (anti-disintegrin antibody for the XT-wt and XT constructs and anti-cytoplasmic peptide antibody for the ETCyt construct; each at 1:500 dilution) and mouse anti-myogenin antibody (1:50 dilution), followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.01 μg/ml; to visualize cell nuclei). After washing with DPBS, coverslips were mounted on glass slides and examined using an Axiovert 200 inverted fluorescence microscope. We observed previously that the recombinant disintegrin and cysteine-rich (DC) domains of mouse ADAM12 expressed in Sf21 insect cells required the presence of Mn2+ to support integrin β1-mediated cell adhesion, suggesting low affinity interactions between the DC protein and integrins (14Zhao Z. Gruszczynska-Biegala J. Cheuvront T. Yi H. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. Kaufman S.J. Zolkiewska A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of a signal peptide, the recombinant protein was not efficiently secreted from Sf21 cells and was purified from cell-associated material (14Zhao Z. Gruszczynska-Biegala J. Cheuvront T. Yi H. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. Kaufman S.J. Zolkiewska A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that the purified protein used in our previous adhesion assays might not have been properly folded. Here, we developed new ADAM12 expression constructs for production of secreted proteins in Drosophila S2 cells. In addition to the DC domain alone, the constructs included the entire extracellular domain of ADAM12 (X-wt and catalytically inactive X; see below), the extracellular domain lacking the EGF-like domain (MDC-wt and catalytically inactive MDC), the extracellular domain lacking the prodomain and metalloprotease domain (DCE), and the prodomain and metalloprotease domain alone (catalytically inactive M) (Fig. 1). All of the constructs contained an exogenous secretion signa"
https://openalex.org/W1994606173,"During ATP hydrolysis, the γεc10 complex (γ and ε subunits and a c subunit ring formed from 10 monomers) of F0F1 ATPase (ATP synthase) rotates relative to the α3β3δab2 complex, leading to proton transport through the interface between the a subunit and the c subunit ring. In this study, we replaced the two pertinent residues for proton transport, cAsp-61 and aArg-210 of the c and a subunits, respectively. The mutant enzymes exhibited lower ATPase activities than that of the wild type but exhibited ATP-dependent rotation in planar membranes, in which their original assemblies are maintained. The mutant enzymes were defective in proton transport, as shown previously. These results suggest that proton transport can be separated from rotation in ATP hydrolysis, although rotation ensures continuous proton transport by bringing the cAsp-61 and aArg-210 residues into the correct interacting positions."
