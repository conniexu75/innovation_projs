Using event-related fMRI, we investigated how people weigh these factors to make purchasing decisions. Consistent with neuroimaging evidence suggesting that distinct circuits anticipate gain and loss, product preference activated the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), while excessive prices activated the insula and deactivated the mesial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) prior to the purchase decision. Activity from each of these regions independently predicted immediately subsequent purchases above and beyond self-report variables. These findings suggest that activation of distinct neural circuits related to anticipatory affect precedes and supports consumers' purchasing decisions."

We first explored the potential of established hepatocyte culture models to stabilize isolated hepatocytes for photoencapsulation (e.g., double gel, Matrigel, cocultivation with nonparenchymal cells). Using photopolymerizable PEG hydrogels, we then tailored both the chemistry and architecture of the hydrogels to further support hepatocyte survival and liver-specific function. Specifically, we incorporated adhesive peptides to ligate key integrins on these adhesion-dependent cells. To identify the appropriate peptides for incorporation, the integrin expression of cultured hepatocytes was monitored by flow cytometry and their functional role in cell adhesion was assessed on full-length extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules and their adhesive peptide domains. In addition, we modified the hydrogel architecture to minimize barriers to nutrient transport for these highly metabolic cells. Viability of encapsulated cells was improved in photopatterned hydrogels with structural features of 500 microm in width over unpatterned, bulk hydrogels. Based on these findings, we fabricated a multilayer photopatterned PEG hydrogel structure containing the adhesive RGD peptide sequence to ligate the alpha5beta1 integrin of cocultured hepatocytes. Three-dimensional photopatterned constructs were visualized by digital volumetric imaging and cultured in a continuous flow bioreactor for 12 d where they performed favorably in comparison to unpatterned, unperfused constructs. These studies will have impact in the field of liver biology as well as provide enabling tools for tissue engineering of other organs."

Previous studies suggested that neurotransmission from MB neurons is only required for memory retrieval. Our unexpected observation that Dorsal Paired Medial (DPM) neurons, which project only to MB neurons, are required during memory storage but not during acquisition or retrieval, led us to revisit the role of MB neurons in memory processing. We show that neurotransmission from the α′β′ subset of MB neurons is required to acquire and stabilize aversive and appetitive odor memory, but is dispensable during memory retrieval. In contrast, neurotransmission from MB αβ neurons is only required for memory retrieval. These data suggest a dynamic requirement for the different subsets of MB neurons in memory and are consistent with the notion that recurrent activity in an MB α′β′ neuron-DPM neuron loop is required to stabilize memories formed in the MB αβ neurons.

The ephemeral nature of memory remains one of the greatest mysteries of modern biological research. Studies over the last century have determined that memory exists in time-dependent phases and is converted from a labile to a stable state after training by a process termed consolidation (Dudai, 2004Dudai Y. The neurobiology of consolidations, or, how stable is the engram.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2004; 55: 51-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). In mammals memory consolidation involves both parallel and sequential use of distinct brain regions. Consolidation initially requires the neural circuitry of the hippocampus and cortex, but once the memory is consolidated, the requirement of the hippocampus is diminished. Hippocampal damage impairs the consolidation of new memories, but leaves old memories intact, suggesting that consolidated memories permanently reside in the cortex (Scoville and Milner, 1957Scoville W.B. Milner B. Loss of recent memory after bilateral hippocampal lesions.J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1957; 20: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4869) Google Scholar). In an animal model, learning and memory can be reduced to the novel association of two stimuli. This straightforward assay can be utilized in invertebrate models where the simpler anatomy and reduced complexity of the brain provide significant technical advantages for analysis of neural circuits involved in memory. Memory in invertebrates such as the sea slug Aplysia californica (Hawkins et al., 2006Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Bailey C.H. Molecular mechanisms of memory storage in Aplysia.Biol.

Small brains, bright minds.Cell. 2006; 124: 237-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Davis, 2005Davis R.L. Olfactory memory formation in Drosophila: from molecular to systems neuroscience.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 275-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) share many of the same properties as their mammalian counterparts. Furthermore, studies in these “simple” systems suggest that the underlying molecular mechanisms have been conserved during evolution. The most frequently studied learning and memory paradigm in Drosophila involves a pairing of one minute of odor (the conditioned stimulus, CS) with 12 electric foot shocks (the unconditioned stimulus, US) producing an aversive odor memory that lasts for several hours (Davis, 2005Davis R.L. Olfactory memory formation in Drosophila: from molecular to systems neuroscience.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 275-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). This memory can be dissected into three distinct phases: short-term memory (STM), middle-term memory (MTM), and anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) (Folkers et al., 1993Folkers E. Drain P. Quinn W.G. Radish, a Drosophila mutant deficient in consolidated memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 8123-8127Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Tully et al., 1994Tully T. Preat T. Boynton S.C. Del V.M. Genetic dissection of consolidated memory in Drosophila.Cell. 1994; 79: 35-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Similar to vertebrate memory, earlier phases—STM and MTM—are labile and can be disrupted with a cold-shock anesthesia, while the later phase, ARM, is anesthesia resistant and therefore represents a form of consolidated memory (Folkers et al., 1993Folkers E. Drain P. Quinn W.G. Radish, a Drosophila mutant deficient in consolidated memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 8123-8127Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Tully et al., 1994Tully T. Preat T. Boynton S.C. Del V.M. Genetic dissection of consolidated memory in Drosophila.Cell. 1994; 79: 35-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). During this time frame (0 to ∼6 hr) memory is believed to be protein-synthesis independent (Tully et al., 1994Tully T. Preat T. Boynton S.C. Del V.M. Genetic dissection of consolidated memory in Drosophila.Cell. 1994; 79: 35-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Although less studied, appetitive olfactory memory, formed by pairing sucrose (instead of shock) with an odor, shares similar temporal properties to aversive olfactory memory (Tempel et al., 1983Tempel B.L.

Biol. 2006; 16: 1524-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A dependence on specific brain regions to process memory also appears to be generally conserved across taxa. The most heavily studied components of the fly olfactory memory circuit are the mushroom bodies (MBs), bilaterally symmetrical structures in the brain comprised of about 5000 neurons in total (Heisenberg, 2003Heisenberg M. Mushroom body memoir: from maps to models.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). In addition to being critical for olfactory memory (Heisenberg et al., 1985Heisenberg M. Borst A. Wagner S. Byers D. Drosophila mushroom body mutants are deficient in olfactory learning.J. Neurogenet. 1985; 2: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994de Belle J.S. Heisenberg M. Associative odor learning in Drosophila abolished by chemical ablation of mushroom bodies.Science. 1994; 263: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), the MBs have also been implicated in other complex adaptive behaviors, including visual context generalization (Liu et al., 1999Liu L. Wolf R. Ernst R. Heisenberg M. Context generalization in Drosophila visual learning requires the mushroom bodies.Nature. 1999; 400: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and choice behavior (Tang and Guo, 2001Tang S. Guo A. Choice behavior of Drosophila facing contradictory visual cues.Science. 2001; 294: 1543-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), courtship conditioning (McBride et al., 1999McBride S.M. Giuliani G. Choi C. Krause P. Correale D. Watson K. Baker G. Siwicki K.K. Mushroom body ablation impairs short-term memory and long-term memory of courtship conditioning in Drosophila melanogaster.Neuron. 1999; 24: 967-977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and sleep (Joiner et al., 2006Joiner W.J. Crocker A. White B.H. Sehgal A. Sleep in Drosophila is regulated by adult mushroom bodies.Nature. 2006; 441: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, Pitman et al., 2006Pitman J.L. McGill J.J. Keegan K.P. Allada R. A dynamic role for the mushroom bodies in promoting sleep in Drosophila.Nature. 2006; 441: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The 2500 intrinsic neurons in each MB can be subdivided into at least three morphological subsets—αβ, α′β′, and γ—based on the bundling of their axonal projections in the region of the MBs called the lobes (Crittenden et al., 1998Crittenden J.R. Skoulakis E.M. Han K.A. Kalderon D. Davis R.L. Tripartite mushroom body architecture revealed by antigenic markers.Learn. Mem. 1998; 5: 38-51PubMed Google Scholar). Each MB neuron that contributes to the αβ subdivision bifurcates and sends one axon branch to the α lobe and one to the β lobe. Similarly, each neuron in the α′β′ lobe bifurcates and sends one axon branch to the α′ lobe and one to the β′ lobe. The significance of this morphological arrangement is poorly understood, and as a result, conceptual models of MB function in olfactory memory do not clearly differentiate between αβ, α′β′, and γ neurons. Experiments conducted with learning- and memory-defective mutant flies have led to the prevailing model in which MB neurons associate the odor CS with the shock, or sugar US, using potential coincidence-detecting molecules like RUT adenylyl cyclase (Zars et al., 2000Zars T.

USA. 2004; 101: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and store the aversive or appetitive associations within the specific neurons that are activated by a particular odor (Heisenberg, 2003Heisenberg M. Mushroom body memoir: from maps to models.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, Davis, 2005Davis R.L. Olfactory memory formation in Drosophila: from molecular to systems neuroscience.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 275-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). This model is supported by the demonstration that transient blockade of MB synaptic transmission during acquisition, storage, and/or retrieval indicates a requirement for MB output only during memory retrieval (Dubnau et al., 2001Dubnau J.

Olfactory memory formation in Drosophila: from molecular to systems neuroscience.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 275-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The apparent dispensability of MB neuron output for memory formation implies that memory could be represented at MB output synapses or synapses that are upstream of MB output synapses. Although there is ample evidence for a role of upstream antennal lobe (AL) circuits in memory in other insects (Stopfer and Laurent, 1999Stopfer M. Laurent G. Short-term memory in olfactory network dynamics.Nature. 1999; 402: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, Daly et al., 2004Daly K.C. Christensen T.A. Lei H. Smith B.H. Hildebrand J.G. Learning modulates the ensemble representations for odors in primary olfactory networks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 10476-10481Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), particularly in the honeybee (Hammer and Menzel, 1998Hammer M. Menzel R.

Joerges J. Menzel R. Associative learning modifies neural representations of odors in the insect brain.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), only one live-imaging study in Drosophila has reported a short-term change in AL neural activity after aversive olfactory training (Yu et al., 2004Yu D. Ponomarev A. Davis R.L. Altered representation of the spatial code for odors after olfactory classical conditioning; memory trace formation by synaptic recruitment.Neuron. 2004; 42: 437-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The analysis of Dorsal Paired Medial (DPM) neurons suggests that a more complex and dynamic process underlies olfactory memory. DPM neurons express the putative neuropeptide precursor encoded by the amn gene and their processes intermingle with the MB lobes, indicative of a role in modulating the MB neuron ensemble (Waddell et al., 2000Waddell S. Armstrong J.D. Kitamoto T. Kaiser K. Quinn W.G. The amnesiac gene product is expressed in two neurons in the Drosophila brain that are critical for memory.Cell. 2000; 103: 805-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Behavioral analyses have demonstrated that output from DPM neurons is critical after training for memory stability and is not required during acquisition or recall (Keene et al., 2004Keene A.C. Stratmann M. Keller A. Perrat P.N. Vosshall L.B. Waddell S. Diverse odor-conditioned memories require uniquely timed dorsal paired medial neuron output.Neuron. 2004; 44: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, Keene et al., 2006Keene A.C.

Biol. 2006; 16: 1524-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2005Yu D. Keene A.C. Srivatsan A. Waddell S. Davis R.L. Drosophila DPM neurons form a delayed and branch-specific memory trace after olfactory classical conditioning.Cell. 2005; 123: 945-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Given that DPM neurons appear to be part of the MB circuit, one might expect that MB neurons would show a similar temporal requirement to DPM neurons during memory consolidation, rather than only in retrieval. However, the current literature does not address this discrepancy. DPM neuron projections to MB α′β′ lobe neurons appear to be sufficient to stabilize aversive and appetitive odor memory, suggesting that a DPM neuron-to-MB α′β′ neuron connection could be critical for memory consolidation (Keene et al., 2006Keene A.C. Krashes M.J. Leung B. Bernard J.A. Waddell S. Drosophila dorsal paired medial neurons provide a general mechanism for memory consolidation.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1524-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These findings led us to investigate the role of MB α′β′ neuron output in memory processing. Here we show that stable memory requires the sequential involvement of different MB neuron subsets. α′β′ neurons are required during and after training to acquire and stabilize olfactory memory, whereas, consistent with a previous report (McGuire et al., 2001McGuire S.E. Le P.T. Davis R.L. The role of Drosophila mushroom body signaling in olfactory memory.Science. 2001; 293: 1330-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), αβ neuron output is only required to retrieve the memory. Similar to mammals, memory processing in flies likely involves parallel and sequential use of distinct neural circuits. Previous studies have reported that MB neuron output is dispensable during memory acquisition and storage (Dubnau et al., 2001Dubnau J. Grady L. Kitamoto T. Tully T.

One possible explanation for this observed difference between MB and DPM neuron temporal requirements is that the previously employed {GAL4} drivers provided incomplete coverage of all MB neuron subtypes. We therefore sought to examine in more detail where the previously employed MB{GAL4} drivers MB247 (Schwaerzel et al., 2002Schwaerzel M. Heisenberg M. Zars T.

Heisenberg M. Zars T.

Le P.T. Davis R.L. The role of Drosophila mushroom body signaling in olfactory memory.Science. 2001; 293: 1330-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) expressed in the MBs. We used the MB247, c309, c747, and c739 {GAL4} drivers to express a membrane-tethered GFP (uas-CD8::GFP) (Lee and Luo, 1999Lee T. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker for studies of gene function in neuronal morphogenesis.Neuron. 1999; 22: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Projections of confocal stacks through the MBs of these GAL4 drivers are shown in Figures 1A1–1D1. Gross inspection of the patterns revealed strong expression in the αβ and γ lobes and significantly less in the α′β′ lobe. This marked difference is most easily observed in the intertwined vertical α and α′ lobes (Figures 1A1–1F1 and Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data). MB247 (Figure 1A1), c309 (Figure 1B1), and c747 (Figure 1C1) strongly express in αβ and γ neurons, and in a few α′β′ neurons as well. c739, as previously described (McGuire et al., 2001McGuire S.E. Le P.T. Davis R.L. The role of Drosophila mushroom body signaling in olfactory memory.Science. 2001; 293: 1330-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), is the most restricted, expressing only in the MB αβ neurons; no GFP expression is visible in the α′ lobes (arrowheads, Figure 1D1). To more precisely examine the enhancer-trap expression patterns in the MB lobes, we colabeled brains with anti-FASII antibody (Grenningloh et al., 1991Grenningloh G. Rehm E.J. Goodman C.S. Genetic analysis of growth cone guidance in Drosophila: fasciclin II functions as a neuronal recognition molecule.Cell. 1991; 67: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) to mark the MB αβ neurons and anti-TRIO antibody to mark the MB α′β′ neurons (Awasaki et al., 2000Awasaki T. Saito M. Sone M. Suzuki E. Sakai R. Ito K. Hama C. The Drosophila trio plays an essential role in patterning of axons by regulating their directional extension.Neuron. 2000; 26: 119-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and examined the colocalization of CD8::GFP with these markers. Representative single confocal sections through the MBs for each of the aforementioned GAL4 lines are shown in Figures 1A2–1D4 and Figures S1A1–S1D3. Our colocalization analysis confirmed the conclusions of our initial visual inspection. MB247 (Figures 1A2–1A4 and Figures S1A1–S1A3), c309 (Figures 1B2–1B4 and Figures S1B1-S1B3), and c747 (Figures 1C2–1C4 and Figures S1C1–S1C3) show little expression in α′β′ neurons, and c739 (Figures 1D2–1D4 and Figures S1D1–S1D3) shows none. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the previous studies that identified a requirement for MB output only during memory retrieval (Dubnau et al., 2001Dubnau J. Grady L. Kitamoto T. Tully T. Disruption of neurotransmission in Drosophila mushroom body blocks retrieval but not acquisition of memory.Nature. 2001; 411: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, McGuire et al., 2001McGuire S.E.

To specifically investigate the role of α′β′ neurons, we first screened a collection of enhancer-trap fly lines (www.fly-trap.org) for those that strongly expressed the GAL4 transcription factor in α′β′ neurons. We identified the c305a and c320 (Martini and Davis, 2005Martini S.R. Davis R.L. The dachshund gene is required for the proper guidance and branching of mushroom body axons in Drosophila melanogaster.J. Neurobiol. 2005; 64: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) lines as candidates and we verified the MB expression of these lines by crossing them to flies harboring a uas-CD8::GFP transgene (Figures 1E1, 1E2, 1F1, and 1F2; and Figures S1E1–S1F3, S2, and S3) and subjecting the brains to the same analysis as the MB247, c309, c747, and c739 drivers. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed CD8::GFP expression that was restricted to α′β′ neurons within the MBs in c305a (Figures 1F2–1F4 and Figures S1F1–S1F3) and α′β′, αβ, and a limited subset of γ neurons in c320 (Figures 1E2–1E4 and Figures S1E1–S1E3). The specificity of c305a for α′β′ neurons is particularly striking in single confocal sections: CD8::GFP shows almost no colocalization with FASII (Figure 1F3 and Figure S1F2) and extensive colocalization with TRIO (Figure 1F4 and Figure S1F3). To further illustrate this specificity, we have included the merged (Figure 1G2) and individual channels corresponding to FASII (Figure 1G3) and TRIO (Figure 1G4) immunofluorescence shown in Figures 1F3 and 1F4, respectively. Other regions of significant expression in c305a include the AL, ring neurons in the ellipsoid body of the central complex (CC), and putative mechanosensory neurons in the antennal nerve (Figure 1F1 and Figure S2). Although c305a and c320 also label other neurons in the brain, we conclude that the most obvious common region of expression in the c305a and c320 lines is the MB α′β′ neurons (also see Supplemental Data). We used the c305a{GAL4} and c320{GAL4} lines (subsequently denoted c305a and c320) to examine the role of MB α′β′ neurons in aversive olfactory memory. Throughout this work we used the c739{GAL4} line (subsequently denoted c739) to compare the role of MB αβ neurons. We taught flies to associate an odor CS with a punitive electric shock US using standard protocols (Tully and Quinn, 1985Tully T. Quinn W.G.

Diverse odor-conditioned memories require uniquely timed dorsal paired medial neuron output.Neuron. 2004; 44: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We first tested the role of MB α′β′ neurons in memory by blocking their output throughout the entire olfactory conditioning experiment (Figure 2B). We expressed the dominant temperature-sensitive shibirets1 (shits1) transgene (Kitamoto, 2001Kitamoto T. Conditional modification of behavior in Drosophila by targeted expression of a temperature-sensitive shibire allele in defined neurons.J. Neurobiol. 2001; 47: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) in MB α′β′ neurons and performed memory experiments at either the permissive (25°C) or the restrictive (31°C) temperature. At the restrictive temperature, shits1 blocks vesicle recycling and thereby blocks synaptic vesicle release. At 25°C odor memory scores of wild-type, uas-shits1, c305a, c305a; uas-shits1, c320, c320; uas-shits1, and c739; uas-shits1 flies were statistically indistinguishable (p > 0.9) (Figure 2A). However, at 31°C memory of c305a; uas-shits1, c320; uas-shits1, and c739; uas-shits1 flies was severely reduced and was statistically different from wild-type, c305a, c320, and uas-shits1 flies (c305a; uas-shits1 all p < 0.02; c320; uas-shits1 all p < 0.001; c739{GAL4}; uas-shits1 all p < 0.001) (Figure 2B). Therefore, MB αβ and α′β′ neuron synaptic release is necessary for odor memory. The four previous reports that principally blocked output from MB αβ and γ neurons concluded that MB output was dispensable during memory acquisition and storage but was required during memory retrieval (Dubnau et al., 2001Dubnau J.

We therefore investigated whether MB α′β′ neurons were required during memory acquisition, consolidation, or retrieval. We again blocked MB α′β′ neuron and MB αβ neuron output with uas-shits1, but we restricted the inactivation to the training, testing, or storage period. Blocking MB αβ neurons during acquisition did not produce memory loss, consistent with the previous report (McGuire et al., 2001McGuire S.E. Le P.T. Davis R.L.

Disruption of PrPC expression in mice, a species that does not naturally contract prion diseases, results in no apparent developmental abnormalities2,3,4,5. However, the impact of ablating PrPC function in natural host species of prion diseases is unknown. Here we report the generation and characterization of PrPC-deficient cattle produced by a sequential gene-targeting system6. At over 20 months of age, the cattle are clinically, physiologically, histopathologically, immunologically and reproductively normal. Brain tissue homogenates are resistant to prion propagation in vitro as assessed by protein misfolding cyclic amplification7. PrPC-deficient cattle may be a useful model for prion research and could provide industrial bovine products free of prion proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2092368988,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones play an important role in many cellular processes, notably gene regulation. Using a combination of mass spectrometric and immunobiochemical approaches, we show that the PTM profile of histone H3 differs significantly among the various model organisms examined. Unicellular eukaryotes, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and Tetrahymena thermophila (Tet), for example, contain more activation than silencing marks as compared with mammalian cells (mouse and human), which are generally enriched in PTMs more often associated with gene silencing. Close examination reveals that many of the better-known modified lysines (Lys) can be either methylated or acetylated and that the overall modification patterns become more complex from unicellular eukaryotes to mammals. Additionally, novel species-specific H3 PTMs from wild-type asynchronously grown cells are also detected by mass spectrometry. Our results suggest that some PTMs are more conserved than previously thought, including H3K9me1 and H4K20me2 in yeast and H3K27me1, -me2, and -me3 in Tet. On histone H4, methylation at Lys-20 showed a similar pattern as H3 methylation at Lys-9, with mammals containing more methylation than the unicellular organisms. Additionally, modification profiles of H4 acetylation were very similar among the organisms examined.

Additionally, modification profiles of H4 acetylation were very similar among the organisms examined. Cellular identity is defined by the characteristic patterns of gene expression and silencing. Inheritance of these transcription patterns through DNA replication and chromatin assembly that accompanies each cell division is crucial for cell survival, but the one or more mechanisms by which this “memory” is achieved are not well understood (reviewed in Ref. 1Cheung P. Lau P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). A rapidly emerging literature suggests that histone proteins, which function to package genomic DNA into repeating nucleosomal units that are then further folded into higher order chromatin fibers, may be major carriers of epigenetic information (2Felsenfeld G. Groudine M. Nature. 2003; 421: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Each nucleosome typically contains ∼146 bp of DNA wrapped around two copies each of histones H3, H4, H2A, and H2B. Although providing a relative constant packaging theme, subtle changes in nucleosome histone:DNA and histone:histone contacts are likely to provide variation in fiber folding that, in turn, translates into biological readout. In general, the packaging of DNA into chromatin is recognized to be a major mechanism by which the access of genomic DNA is restricted. This physical barrier to the underlying DNA is precisely regulated (and counteracted), at least in part, by the post-translational modifications (PTMs) 9The abbreviations used are: PTM, post-translational modification; ac, acetylation; me, methylation; H3, histone H3; H4, histone H4; Tet, T. thermophila; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. 9The abbreviations used are: PTM, post-translational modification; ac, acetylation; me, methylation; H3, histone H3; H4, histone H4; Tet, T. thermophila; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. of histones. A wide number of studies has revealed that PTMs of histones, especially those located in the N-terminal tails, play a pivotal role in the regulation of chromatin structure necessary for DNA accessibility during gene expression. Remarkable diversity in the histone/nucleosome structure is generated by a variety of PTMs, such as lysine and arginine methylation, lysine acetylation, serine and threonine phosphorylation, and lysine ubiquitination (reviewed in Refs. 3Iizuka M. Smith M.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 4Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Some PTMs, including acetylation and phosphorylation, are reversible and dynamic and are often associated with inducible gene expression. Other PTMs, such as lysine methylation, are often found to be more stable, participating in long term maintenance of the expression status of regions in the genome that vary in certain developmental contexts (6Bernstein E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1635-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, recent work has shown that many lysine methylation “marks” on histones can also be reversed by enzymatic means (7Whetstine J.R. Nottke A. Lan F. Huarte M. Smolikov S. Chen Z. Spooner E.

Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3156) Google Scholar). Histone PTMs occur on multiple but specific sites, suggesting that histone PTMs can act as signaling platforms for proteins that “read” these marks (10Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). The “histone-code hypothesis” has been put forward to explain how different combinations of histone PTMs can result in distinct chromatin-regulated functions (11Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6585) Google Scholar, 12Turner B.M. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 13Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7633) Google Scholar). The deciphering of the “code” is complicated further by the observation that certain residues can be either acetylated or methylated, as has been shown for histone H3 lysine 9 in mammalian cells (14Nicolas E. Roumillac C. Trouche D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1614-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Acetylation of these residues is associated with transcriptional activation and methylation often, but not always (see below), with repression of genes. In contrast, methylation of histone H3 on Lys-4, Lys-36, and Lys-79 correlates with transcriptional activation of genes (15Wang H. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Borchers C. Tempst P. Zhang Y.

Besides PTMs, the exchange of core histones with histone variants, which differ slightly in their amino acid sequence and which are enriched in different marks (18McKittrick E. Gafken P.R. Ahmad K. Henikoff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 19Hake S.B. Garcia B.A. Duncan E.M. Kauer M. Dellaire G. Shabanowitz J. Bazett-Jones D.P.

In this study, we sought to examine the extent to which the histone code is universal, focusing on H3 and H4 from a limited, but select, number of popular organisms as an entry point for our studies. Using both mass spectrometry (MS) and immunobiochemical approaches, we show that the PTM profile of histone H3 greatly differs among species and that the PTM pattern is more complex in mammals as compared with “simple” eukaryotes, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and Tetrahymena thermophila (Tet). Unicellular eukaryotes exhibit more marks associated with transcriptional activation or transcriptional competency, whereas mammals contain more modifications linked to gene repression. Additionally, we identified several novel PTMs that are potentially species-specific, such as H3K4ac (observed in Tet, mouse, and human) and H3K79ac (human), H3K23me1 (yeast, mouse, and human), H3K14me2 and H3K64ac (yeast), and H3K56me3 (human). Surprisingly, we observed low amounts of H3K9me1 and H3K27me3 in yeast, and H3K27me1, -me2, and -me3 in Tet; such modifications have not been detected before in these particular organisms. Additionally, we characterized PTMs of histone H4 from the same set of organisms. We found that H4 is far less modified than H3 and that the H4 acetylation patterns remained consistent across the species examined. In addition, H4K20 methylation was found in higher levels on human and mouse than the unicellular species. Some low abundance novel H4 PTMs were also identified, such as H4K20me2 and H4K20ac in yeast. Collectively, our data reveal a diverse pattern of modification usage on histone H3 that is fundamentally different among unicellular organisms and mammals. We suggest that these differences may be due to the co-development of additional histone-modifying enzymes and histone H3 variants, allowing for additional regulation of more complex genomes.

The HPLC gradient used on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC solvent delivery system (Palo Alto, CA) consisted of 0-60% B in 60 min, and then 60 -100% B in 10 min (A = 0.1% acetic acid, B = 70% acetonitrile in 0.1% acetic acid). Immunoblotting—Immunoblots with total acid extracted histones were done as described previously (25Hake S.B. Garcia B.A. Kauer M. Baker S.P. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

For peptide competition, the H3K4 acetyl antibody was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml of the following peptides: H3 unmodified, amino acids 1-20; H3K4ac, amino acids 1-20 with Lys-4 acetylated; H3K4me2; amino acids 1-20 with Lys-4 dimethylated; H3K9ac, amino acids 1-20 with Lys-9 acetylated; H3K36ac, amino acids 27-46 with Lys-36 acetylated; H4 unmodified, amino acids 1-16; H4K5ac, amino acids 2-20 with Lys-5 acetylated; and H4 tetra-acetyl, amino acids 1-18 with Lys-5, Lys-8, Lys-12, and Lys-16 acetylated. Peptides were synthesized and verified by MS at the Proteomics Resource Center of The Rockefeller University, Upstate Biotechnology, and the Protein Chemistry Core Facility at the University of North Carolina, School of Medicine. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The same peptides used in peptide competition assays were also used for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Briefly, peptides were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline in concentrations from 0 to 100 ng/ml, and 200 μl was transferred to a 96-well plate (Covance) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The plate was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (containing 0.05% Tween 20), blocked with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline/0.05% Tween 20 containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After two additional wash steps, 100 μl of diluted primary antibody was added to the plate, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing, 100 μl of secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After two wash steps 100 μl of O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate (Sigma) was added, and the plate was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. The detection reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 3 m HCl, and the absorbance was measured at 492 nm in a plate reader (Bioscan). Antibodies—To develop an antibody against histone H3K4ac, a synthetic histone H3 peptide modified by acetylation at Lys-4 was chemically synthesized, conjugated to KLH, and used to immunize rabbits by Upstate Biotechnology. The positive anti-sera were further purified by immunoaffinity purification. The H3K4ac antibody was diluted 1:1,000 in immunoblots and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 1:100 in immunofluorescence microscopy. The following antibodies from Upstate Biotechnology were used as 1:1,000 dilutions in immunoblots: H3K9me1, -me2, and -me3; H3K27me1, -me2, -me3, and -ac; H3K36me1 and -me2; and H3K79me2. One other antiserum from UBI was used in this study in the following dilution in immunoblot: H3K56ac (1:5,000), and the following antibodies from Abcam were used: H3K4me1, -me2, and -me3 (1:1,000) and H3K79me3 (1:1,000). The anti-H3K36me3 antibody, obtained from UBI, was used at a 1:10,000 dilution. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy analyses were done as described previously (25Hake S.B.

Comparison of Histone H3 PTMs among Unicellular Eukaryotes and Mammals—To examine the PTM profiles on histone H3 from different species, we extracted and RP-HPLC-purified histones from several model organisms, including yeast, Tet, mouse, and human cells. All of the RP-HPLC H3-containing fractions (regardless of which H3 variants were present, see supplemental Fig. S1) were combined and then subjected to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), which has been successfully used previously to analyze histone H3 (19Hake S.B. Garcia B.A. Duncan E.M. Kauer M. Dellaire G. Shabanowitz J. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Hunt D.F. J. Biol.

This procedure results in the production of predicted peptide sets that could be easily detected by MS (19Hake S.B. Garcia B.A. Duncan E.M. Kauer M. Dellaire G. Shabanowitz J. Bazett-Jones D.P.

Species Comparison of “ON” Marks—Shown in Fig. 1 are mass spectra that facilitate a comparative analysis of PTMs that occur at lysine 4 of H3, a well known “ON” epigenetic methylation mark (26Bernstein B.E. Humphrey E.L. Erlich R.L. Schneider R. Bouman P. Liu J.S. Kouzarides T. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8695-8700Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Summed mass spectra that record the ion abundances for [M + 2H]2+ ions corresponding to residues 3-8 of H3 from human, mouse, Tet, and yeast are presented in Fig. 1, A-D, respectively. Because the protein samples have been derivatized with propionic anhydride (addition of 56 Da to unmodified and monomethylated lysine residues, only) prior to enzymatic digestion with trypsin, the signals for the [M + 2H]2+ ions of peptides containing H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K4, and H3K4me1 appeared at m/z 394, 401, 408, and 415, respectively. As indicated in Fig. 1 (A-D), the degree of methylation of Lys-4 among the various organisms examined greatly differs with several consistent trends noted. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), human and mouse H3 display similar profiles: unmodified Lys-4 is the most abundant species, whereas K4me1 is very low. Occasionally, contaminant peaks were observed in the mass spectra that, upon fragmentation, produce MS/MS spectra, which do not match any histone peptide such as the singly charged ion around m/z 396.8 (Fig. 1B, asterisk). Surprisingly, a small amount of K4ac was seen in human H3 (Fig. 1A and supplemental Figs. S2 and S3), as differentiated by accurate mass (-0.25 ppm) and retention time. Accurate mass measurement with the linear quadrupole ion trap-Fourier transform instrument can distinguish between trimethylated and acetylated peptides (Δm = 0.0364 Da). To our knowledge, H3K4ac has not been reported in histones from any source. We also detected this novel modification as existing in a lower abundance in Tet and mouse, but this mark was not observed with our current detection limits in yeast. In striking contrast, however, we found that unicellular eukaryotes (Tet and yeast) contained higher degrees of H3K4me1, -me2, and -me3. Unlike in human and mouse H3; Tet (Fig. 1C) and yeast (Fig. 1D) H3 display clearly visible amounts of K4me2 and -me3. These results agree well with immunoblot analyses showing a large amount of H3K4me2 detected on histone H3 from ciliate and yeast as compared with mouse and human histone (27Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y. Winston F. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), as well as robust enzymatic Lys-4 methylation activity found in crude preparations of yeast and ciliate nuclei (28Strahl B.D. Ohba R. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14967-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The degree of methylation on H3K4 is easily differentiated by tandem MS. For example, an MS/MS spectrum of the [M + 2H]2+ peptide at 394.7344 m/z from the Tet sample (Fig. 1C) is shown in Fig. 1E, and the b1, b2, y4, and y5 fragment ions indicate that H3K4 is dimethylated on this peptide (3-8 residues). Fig. 1F shows an MS/MS spectrum of the doubly charged peptide ion at 401.7425 m/z generated from the yeast H3 sample (Fig. 1D) and was identified as the 3-8 residue fragment containing K4me3 as revealed by the y4 and y5 fragment ions. The experimental mass of this peptide is consistent with trimethylation (-1.1 ppm error) and not acetylation (+44.1 ppm error). These data show that mammals have far less H3K4 methylation than unicellular eukaryotes, suggesting that the usage of this particular ON mark was reduced during evolution. Another modification associated with transcriptional activation is the methylation of H3K79 by the Dot1 histone methyltransferase (29van Leeuwen F. Gafken P.R. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). A comparison of PTMs on a peptide spanning residues 73-83 of histone H3 that contains the Lys-79 residue from the above mentioned four different species can be seen in Fig. 2 The PTM profiles at this site are remarkably different than what we observed on peptides containing H3K4. For example, human and mouse H3 (Fig. 2, A and B) displayed similar profiles (H3K79me1 is the most abundant species) and H3K79me2 was also observed. Interestingly, a small amount of H3K79ac could be seen as differentiated by accurate mass (+3.2 ppm) on the human sample (see also supplemental data page 6). Nevertheless, the degree of methylation of H3K79 was restricted to only a small amount of monomethylation in Tet (Fig. 2C), whereas yeast contained a high degree of H3K79 methylation with the trimethylated form being the most abundant (Fig. 2D). A tandem mass spectrum of the [M + 2H]2+ peptide at 727.8863 m/z from the Tet sample is shown in Fig. 2E, and fragment ions (b6, b7, y4, and y5) indicate that H3K79 is monomethylated on this peptide (73-83 residues). Fig. 2F shows an MS/MS spectrum of the doubly charged ion at 717.3864 m/z generated from the yeast H3 sample (Fig. 2D). This peptide was identified as the 73-83 residue fragment containing H3K79me3 as determined from observing the same indicator fragment ions (b6, b7, y4, and y5) as seen on Fig. 2E. The experimental mass of this peptide (717.3864 m/z) determined that a trimethylation (+1.1 ppm error) and not acetylation (+26.5 ppm error) mark was present. These data suggest that, similar to the H3K4 modification profile, mouse and human are almost identical in their H3K79 modifications. On the other hand, in contrast to H3K4 methylation, yeast and Tet are different from each other in their PTM profile, possibly due to the lack of Dot1 and sequence differences in Tet. In conclusion, mammals are similar to each other, but differ greatly from unicellular eukaryotes with regard to their H3K4 and Lys-79 modification profiles. Species Comparison of OFF Marks—A well established modification that is associated with transcriptional repression and constitutive heterochromatin formation is the methylation of H3K9 (30Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). We wondered if organisms differ in their H3K9 modification profile from each other, as we have seen for ON marks (Figs. 1 and 2). A species comparison of modifications at Lys-9 on histone H3 is shown in Fig. 3, a residue known to exhibit both acetylation (ON) or methylation (OFF). Fig. 3 shows the summed full mass spectra around the 520-550 m/z range, which display the [M + 2H]2+ peptides spanning residues 9-17 from human (A), mouse (B), Tet (C), and yeast (D) samples. In contrast to the modification profiles obtained on H3K4 from the same species, an increasing shift in the degree of methylation at H3K9 was seen in mammals as compared with Tet and yeast. Both human and mouse contain H3K9, -me1, -me2, -me3, and -ac, with H3K9me2 being the most abundant modification. Peptides containing Lys-9 from Tet and yeast H3 (Fig. 3, C and D) show that this residue is not as heavily modified, because the unmodified peptide is the most abundant species in both organisms. Acetylated peptides account for the most abundant modification in both unicellular organisms, with H3K9ac in Tet being present at relatively higher levels (Fig. 3C). Unexpectedly, based on the existing literature, a low amount of H3K9me3 is detected in Tet, and H3K9me1 (see also supplemental data page 3) in yeast to far less of an extent and degree of methylation at Lys-9 that characterizes mammals. Localization of the modified site was accomplished by MS/MS, and Fig. 3E depicts an MS/MS spectrum of the [M + 2H]2+ 9-17 residue peptide at 535.3129 m/z from the Tet sample. Fragment ion b1 indicates the presence of H3K9me3. A tandem mass spectrum is displayed in Fig. 3F of the [M + 2H]2+ 9-17 residue peptide at 521.3056 m/z generated from the human sample, and the b1 ion determined that it contained H3K9me2. These data suggest that, as observed for ON modifications, the H3K9 modification profiles of mammals are almost identical to each other but differ greatly from the ones detected in unicellular eukaryotes. In contrast to the ON marks, which are present in very low abundance in human and mouse, OFF marks are easily detectable in more complex organisms, whereas the opposite is true for unicellular eukaryotes. Lastly, we examined the modification profile of H3 peptides spanning residues 27-40, which contain both Lys-27 and Lys-36, two well known modification sites that when methylated have been linked to gene repression and activation, respectively (16Bannister A.J. Schneider R. Myers F.A. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17732-17736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 31Chow J.C. Brown C.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2586-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 4 are mass spectra that facilitate a comparative analysis of modifications that occur on Lys-27 and Lys-36 of H3. Summed mass spectra, which record the ion abundances for [M + 2H]2+ ions corresponding to residues 27-40 of H3 from human, mouse, Tet, and yeast, are presented in panels A-D, respectively. In samples from human and mouse cells, we found several different isomeric forms of H3. Of the H3 isomeric forms detected in mammals the one acetylated at Lys-27 was by far the least abundant. Isomeric forms without modifications on Lys-27 and Lys-36 and those that contain K27me1, K27me2, K36me1, and K36me2 and modifications on both Lys-27 and Lys-36 were of intermediate abundance. H3 with K27me3 was the most abundant isomeric form in the mixture. Fig. 4 (C and D) shows the mass spectral data acquired on H3 isomeric forms isolated from Tet and yeast. We found these samples were enriched in H3 not modified at either Lys-27 or Lys-36. Both samples were also enriched for the isomeric form containing K27ac. Isomeric forms that contained K27me1, K27me2, and K27me3 were abundant in Tet but not readily detected in yeast. The finding of methylated H3 Lys-27 in Tet is novel and is currently under investigation. 10Taverna, S. D., Ueberheide, B. M., Lin, Y., Tackett, A. J., Di"
https://openalex.org/W2011207394,"Nerve growth factor engages two structurally distinct transmembrane receptors, TrkA and p75, which have been proposed to create a ""high-affinity"" NGF binding site through formation of a ternary TrkA/NGF/p75 complex. To define a structural basis for the high-affinity site, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of a complete extracellular domain of TrkA complexed with NGF. The complex reveals a crab-shaped homodimeric TrkA structure, but a mechanism for p75 coordination is not obvious. We investigated the heterodimerization of membrane-bound TrkA and p75, on intact mammalian cells, using a beta-gal protein-protein interaction system. We find that NGF dimerizes TrkA and that p75 exists on the cell surface as a preformed oligomer that is not dissociated by NGF. We find no evidence for a direct TrkA/p75 interaction. We propose that TrkA and p75 likely communicate through convergence of downstream signaling pathways and/or shared adaptor molecules, rather than through direct extracellular interactions."

However, the extent of crosstalk between these pathways and the downstream CREB kinase activated during memory formation has not been elucidated. Here we report that PKA, MAPK, and MSK1, a CREB kinase, are coactivated in a subset of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons following contextual fear conditioning. Activation of PKA, MAPK, MSK1, and CREB is absolutely dependent on Ca2+-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. We conclude that adenylyl cyclase activity supports the activation of MAPK, and that MSK1 is the major CREB kinase activated during training for contextual memory."

https://openalex.org/W2021332276,"The cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) is one of the most abundant seven transmembrane (7TM) spanning/G-protein-coupled receptors in the central nervous system and plays an important role in pain transmission, feeding, and the rewarding effects of cannabis. Tolerance to cannabinoids has been widely observed after long-term use, with concomitant receptor desensitization and/or down-regulation depending on the brain region studied. Several CB1R agonists promote receptor internalization after activation, but the postendocytic sorting of the receptor has not been studied in detail. Utilizing human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells stably expressing the CB1R and primary cultured neurons expressing endogenous CB1R, we show that treatment with cannabinoid agonists results in CB1R degradation after endocytosis and that the G-protein-coupled receptor-associated sorting protein GASP1 plays a major role in the postendocytic sorting process. Thus, these results may identify a molecular mechanism underlying tolerance and receptor down-regulation after long-term use of cannabinoids."
https://openalex.org/W2091564167,"Rats use their whiskers to locate and discriminate tactile features of their environment. Mechanoreceptors surrounding each whisker encode and transmit sensory information from the environment to the brain via afferents whose cell bodies lie in the trigeminal ganglion (Vg). These afferents are classified as rapidly (RA) or slowly (SA) adapting by their response to stimulation. The activity of these cells in the awake behaving rat is yet unknown. Therefore, we developed a method to chronically record Vg neurons during natural whisking behaviors and found that all cells exhibited (1) no neuronal activity when the whiskers were not in motion, (2) increased activity when the rat whisked, with activity correlated to whisk frequency, and (3) robust increases in activity when the whiskers contacted an object. Moreover, we observed distinct differences in the firing rates between RA and SA cells, suggesting that they encode distinct aspects of stimuli in the awake rat."
https://openalex.org/W2083134443,"Under ambient air conditions, NO inhibits NMDAR activity by reacting with the NR2A subunit C399 along with two additional cysteine pairs if their disulfide bonds are reduced to free thiol groups [NR1(C744,C798); NR2(C87,C320)]. Here we demonstrate that relative hypoxia enhances S-nitrosylation of NMDARs by a unique mechanism involving an ""NO-reactive oxygen sensor motif"" whose determinants include C744 and C798 of the NR1 subunit. Redox reactions involving these two thiol groups sensitize other NMDAR sites to S-nitrosylation and consequent receptor inhibition, while their own nitrosylation has little effect on NMDAR activity. The crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain of NR1 reveals a flexible disulfide bond (C744-C798), which may account for its susceptibility to reduction and subsequent reaction with NO that is observed with biochemical techniques. These thiols may be nitrosylated preferentially during increasing hypoxia or stroke conditions, thus preventing excessive activity associated with cytotoxicity while avoiding blockade of physiologically active NMDARs."
https://openalex.org/W2116763746,"Hypoxia, as occurs during tissue ischemia, tips the natural anticoagulant/procoagulant balance of the endovascular wall to favor activation of coagulation. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is an important factor suppressing fibrinolysis under conditions of low oxygen tension. We previously reported that hypoxia induced PAI-1 mRNA and antigen expression in murine macrophages secondary to increased de novo transcription as well as increased mRNA stability. We now show in RAW264.7 murine macrophages that the transcription factors early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1), hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) are quickly activated in hypoxia and are responsible for transcription and expression of PAI-1. Murine PAI-1 promoter constructs, including Egr, HIF-1alpha, and/or C/EBPalpha binding sites, were transfected into RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. To identify the relative importance of each of these putative hypoxia-responsive elements, cells were exposed to normobaric hypoxia, and transcriptional activity was recorded. At 16 h of hypoxic exposure, murine PAI-1 promoter deletion constructs that included Egr, HIF-1alpha, and/or C/EBPalpha binding sites demonstrated increased transcriptional activity. Mutation of each of these three murine PAI-1 promoter sites (or a combination of them) resulted in a marked reduction in hypoxia sensitivity as detected by transcriptional analysis. Functional data obtained using 32P-labeled Egr, HIF-1alpha response element (HRE), and C/EBPalpha oligonucleotides revealed induction of DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts from hypoxic RAW cells, with supershift analysis confirming activation of Egr-1, HIF-1alpha, or C/EBPalpha. ChIP analysis confirmed the authenticity of these interactions as each of these transcription factors binds to chromatin under hypoxic conditions. Further, the induction of PAI-1 by Egr-1, HIF-1alpha, or C/EBPalpha was replicated in primary peritoneal macrophages. These data suggest that although HIF-1alpha appears to dominate the PAI-1 transcriptional response in hypoxia, Egr-1 and C/EBPalpha greatly augment this response and can do so independent of HIF-1alpha or each other. These studies are relevant to ischemic up-regulation of the PAI-1 gene and consequent accrual of microvascular thrombus under ischemic conditions."

Current experimental evidence suggests that TRPM6 may function in a specific association with TRPM7 by means of heterooligomeric channel complex formation. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of a new hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia missense mutation in TRPM6. The affected subject presented with profound hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia caused by compound heterozygous mutation in the TRPM6 gene: 1208(-1)G > A affecting the acceptor splice site preceding exon 11, and 3050C > G resulting in the amino acid change (P1017R) in the putative pore-forming region of TRPM6. To assess the functional consequences of the P1017R mutation, TRPM6P1017R and wild-type TRPM6 were co-expressed with TRPM7 in Xenopus oocytes and HEK 293 cells, and currents were assessed by two-electrode voltage clamp and whole cell patch clamp measurements, respectively. Co-expression of wild-type TRPM6 and TRPM7 resulted in a significant increase in the amplitude of TRPM7-like currents. In contrast, TRPM6P1017R suppressed TRPM7 channel activity. In line with these observations, TRPM7, containing the corresponding mutation P1040R, displayed a dominant-negative effect upon co-expression with wild-type TRPM7. Confocal microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer recordings demonstrated that the P1017R mutation neither affects assembly of TRPM6 with TRPM7, nor co-trafficking of heteromultimeric channel complexes to the cell surface.

However, the functional interplay between kinase and channel domains in TRPM7 is far from being understood (15Schmitz C. Perraud A.L. Johnson C.O. Inabe K. Smith M.K. Penner R. Kurosaki T. Fleig A.

Conflicting findings have been reported concerning functional characteristics of TRPM6 expressed in heterologous cell systems. According to Voets et al. (29Voets T. Nilius B.

Chem. 2004; 279: 19-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), TRPM6 forms homooligomeric channel complexes with biophysical characteristics similar to those of TRPM7. More recently, Li et al. (30Li M. Jiang J. Yue L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) described a number of TRPM6 properties different from TRPM7, including single channel conductance, divalent cation permeability, and pH sensitivity. In contrast, two other studies suggest that TRPM6 functions only in association with TRPM7 by means of heterooligomeric channel complex formation (8Chubanov V. Waldegger S. Mederos y Schnitzler M. Vitzthum H. Sassen M.C. Seyberth H.W. Konrad M. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2894-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 28Schmitz C. Dorovkov M.V. Zhao X.

Consistently, in DT40 cells, which are Mg2+-deficient due to a genetically disrupted TRPM7 gene, recombinant human TRPM6 (unlike TRPM7) is unable to compensate for TRPM7 (28Schmitz C. Dorovkov M.V.

Within the formed channel complex, TRPM6 potentiates TRPM7 channel activity (8Chubanov V. Waldegger S. Mederos y Schnitzler M. Vitzthum H. Sassen M.C. Seyberth H.W. Konrad M. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2894-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and is able to cross-phosphorylate TRPM7, but not vice versa (28Schmitz C. Dorovkov M.V. Zhao X. Davenport B.J. Ryazanov A.G. Perraud A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37763-37771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Moreover, in terms of biophysical characteristics, heterooligomeric TRPM6/7 channels were found to be different from TRPM7 homooligomers (30Li M. Jiang J. Yue L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). At present, the stoichiometry of TRPM6/7 in native channel complexes remains unknown. Most HSH mutations in TRPM6 introduce stop codons, deletions of exons, frame shifts, or affect splice sites, thus resulting in complete loss of function (7Schlingmann K.P. Sassen M.C. Weber S. Pechmann U. Kusch K. Pelken L. Lotan D. Syrrou M. Prebble J.J. Cole D.E. Metzger D.L. Rahman S. Tajima T. Shu S.G. Waldegger S. Seyberth H.W. Konrad M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 3061-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains elusive whether a lack of channel and/or kinase activities of TRPM6 is responsible for the HSH phenotype. Therefore, the molecular analysis of HSH mutations affecting distinct domains of TRPM6/7 (for instance, the kinase domain and pore-forming segments) should be instrumental in dissecting the specific role of different TRPM6 domains for Mg2+ handling. For example, we recently discovered the disease-causing molecular mechanism of a TRPM6 missense mutation, which disrupts the heteromeric assembly of TRPM6 and TRPM7 thereby eliciting HSH (8Chubanov V. Waldegger S. Mederos y Schnitzler M. Vitzthum H. Sassen M.C. Seyberth H.W. Konrad M. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2894-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of a novel point mutation in the TRPM6 gene. We disclose a novel molecular mechanism underlying HSH: The P1017R mutation neither affects the expression of the TRPM6 protein, nor its co-assembly with TRPM7, but impairs channel activity of TRPM6/7 complexes by dominant-negative suppression. The effect exerted by TRPM6P1017R strongly supports the notion that both channel subunits contribute to functional TRPM6/7 complexes. Thus, a suppression of cation fluxes via bi-functional TRPM6/7 complexes is sufficient for the development of HSH. Subjects, Genotyping, and Clinical Studies—Identification and clinical characterization of an HSH subject (Family F14) was reported previously (7Schlingmann K.P. Sassen M.C. Weber S. Pechmann U.

Nephrol. 2005; 16: 3061-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Subsequent genotyping, reported here, was performed using direct sequencing of the entire coding region of the TRPM6 gene from genomic DNA extracted from blood leukocytes as described (5Schlingmann K.P.

Assessment of renal magnesium handling, as well as determination of serum [Mg2+] and [Ca2+] levels were performed as reported (5Schlingmann K.P. Weber S. Peters M. Niemann Nejsum L. Vitzthum H.

Molecular Biology and Generation of TRPM6 and TRPM7 Antibodies—Human TRPM6 (TRPM6, variant a, AY333285) and mouse TRPM7 (NM_021450) cDNAs were cloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His TA-TOPO eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen) as described previously (8Chubanov V. Waldegger S. Mederos y Schnitzler M. Vitzthum H. Sassen M.C. Seyberth H.W. Konrad M. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2894-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). TRPM6P1017R and TRPM7P1040R mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange system (Stratagene). To generate TRPM6 and TRPM7 C-terminally fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP), enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), STOP codons were replaced by XhoI restriction sites through site-directed mutagenesis followed by in-frame subcloning of YFP cDNAs. Previously, we demonstrated that YFP tags do not influence trafficking and channel properties of TRPM6 and TRPM7 (8Chubanov V. Waldegger S. Mederos y Schnitzler M. Vitzthum H. Sassen M.C. Seyberth H.W. Konrad M. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2894-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Expression of TRPM6 and TRPM7 in Xenopus laevis oocytes was performed using cDNAs subcloned into the pOGII vector (a pBluescript derivative with the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of Xenopus β-globin). All cDNA constructs used in the present work were confirmed by sequencing. A polyclonal TRPM6 antiserum was obtained as recently reported (8Chubanov V. Waldegger S. Mederos y Schnitzler M. Vitzthum H. Sassen M.C. Seyberth H.W. Konrad M. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2894-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). To generate a polyclonal TRPM7-specific antibody, rabbits were immunized with the following peptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemacyanin: H2N-DSPEVDSKAALLP-COOH (Eurogentec, Brussels). Subsequently, the TRPM7-specific antibody was purified by peptide affinity chromatography. Structural Analysis of the TRPM6 Pore-forming Region—Three-dimensional coordinates of the S1-S6 segment of the human TRPM6 protein (Q9BX84) were acquired from MODBASE (salilab.org/modbase), a data base of annotated comparative protein structure models (31Pieper U. Eswar N. Davis F.P. Braberg H. Madhusudhan M.S. Rossi A. Marti-Renom M. Karchin R. Webb B.M. Eramian D. Shen M.Y. Kelly L. Melo F. Sali A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 (database issue): D291-D295Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The pore-forming segment of TRPM6 (amino acids 872-1074) was matched to the structure of KvAP, a voltage-dependent K+ channel from the thermophilic archae-bacterium Aeropyrum pernix (32Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar), PDB code 1orq (chain C, amino acids 28-240). Accordingly, the 1orq template was applied for comparative modeling, and annotated coordinates were used to generate molecular graphics images with the University of California at San Francisco Chimera package (33Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (28368) Google Scholar). For simplicity, only α-carbon traces of the S5-S6 regions from TRPM6 and KvAP are shown (Fig. 1B). For sequence alignment ClustalW (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) was used. Cell Culture, Transient Expression, and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Earle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria). Cells were transiently transfected using the FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable cell lines expressing TRPM6 and TRPM7 were generated using an ecdysone-inducible expression system (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's instructions. Briefly, TRPM6 and TRPM7 cDNAs were subcloned into the pIND(SP1)/Hygro expression vector (Invitrogen) and transfected into the EcR293 cell line (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were selected by culturing in 400 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen), propagated, and analyzed for ponasterone A-inducible expression by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Two clones were selected for further analysis: M6pIND (clone 2-1, expressing human TRPM6) and M7pIND (clone 2-19, expressing mouse TRPM7). The M6pIND and M7pIND cell lines were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Earle's medium (PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 400 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 400 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Western Blotting—M6pIND and M7pIND cells grown in 35-mm dishes to ∼80% confluence were induced by different concentrations of ponasterone A (Invitrogen) as indicated in the figure legends. 24 h after induction, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3). Next, 1 ml of 2× Laemmli buffer was added and samples were heated for 5 min at 65 °C. Cell lysates (20 μl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (8%) and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes (Protran, Whatman). After incubation in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature, blots were probed either with anti-TRPM6 antiserum (1:1000) or anti-TRPM7 antibody (2 μg/ml) in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. We used peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) (Sigma) as secondary antibody. For a loading control, blots were re-probed using a rabbit polyclonal anti-β-actin antibody (1:1000, Abcam). Peroxidase activity was detected with a chemiluminescence substrate (SuperSignal West Pico Substrate, Pierce) and X-Omat UV Plus Films (Kodak). RT-PCR—M6pIND and M7pIND cells grown in 35-mm dishes to ∼80% confluence were induced by different concentrations of ponasterone A. RT-PCR was performed as reported previously (8Chubanov V. Waldegger S. Mederos y Schnitzler M. Vitzthum H. Sassen M.C. Seyberth H.W. Konrad M. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2894-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). To specifically monitor ponasterone A-inducible expression of TRPM6 and TRPM7 transcripts, a low number of PCR cycles (20Kozak J.A. Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 499-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was performed with the isoform-specific (human TRPM6a) or the species-specific (mouse TRPM7) primer pairs: M6for, 5′-AGGGCCTGCAAATCAAAG-3′; M6rev, 5′-GAGGGCATAGTAAAGTTCTGGA-3′;M7for, 5′-AAGATTTGCCCGTGATACCCCAGAG-3′; and M7rev, 5′-TTCACTATATCCAGCAGCACCCACAT-3′. Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy—For subcellular localization of YFP-tagged TRPM6 and TRPM7, HEK 293 cells grown on 25-mm glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes were transiently transfected with plasmid DNAs (2 μg/dish) as indicated in the figure legends. In co-expression experiments, a 1:3 cDNA mixture (YFP-tagged/untagged cDNAs) was used to increase the probability of the incorporation of YFP-labeled channel subunits into heterotetramers. Living cells were directly examined 16-24 h after transfection. Confocal and differential interference-contrast (DIC) images of living cells were obtained with a LSM510 META confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss). We used a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil objective, the 488 nm excitation wavelength of an argon laser, and a 505 nm long-pass filter. The pinhole diameter was set to yield optical sections of 0.6 μm. For immunofluorescent staining, M6pIND or M7pIND cells grown on 25-mm glass coverslips were induced with 5 μm ponasterone A. 24 h after induction, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with ice-cold methanol for 20 min at -20 °C, and blocked for 1 h with 10% (v/v) normal goat serum in PBS at room temperature. The TRPM7-specific antibody (0.3 μg/ml) or the TRPM6-specific antiserum (1:1000) were applied. The secondary antibody (0.5 μg/ml) was goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa488 (Molecular Probes). Each incubation was performed in PBS containing 5% (v/v) normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature followed by a triple washing step with PBS. After the final washing step, coverslips were placed on glass slides using mounting medium (DakoCytomation), and examined using a LSM510 META confocal laser scanning microscope as indicated above. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Recordings—Our static FRET protocol was based on donor (CFP) fluorescence recovery after acceptor (YFP) bleach as reported previously (8Chubanov V. Waldegger S. Mederos y Schnitzler M. Vitzthum H. Sassen M.C. Seyberth H.W. Konrad M. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, HEK 293 cells grown on 25-mm glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes were transiently transfected with 4 μg/dish plasmid DNAs (1 μg of plasmid cDNA encoding the CFP-tagged TRPM channel subunit and 3 μg of plasmid encoding the respective YFP-tagged subunit). Cells were examined 40-48 h after transfection at room temperature in HEPES-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) with an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with a polychrome IV monochromator (TILL Photonics), an Olympus 63×/1.4 UApo objective, a Sensicam charge-coupled device camera, and a Lambda 10-2 emission filter wheel (Sutter Instruments). FRET efficiencies were determined by monitoring the increase in the CFP (FRET donor) fluorescence emission during selective YFP (FRET acceptor) photobleaching (8Chubanov V. Waldegger S. Mederos y Schnitzler M. Vitzthum H. Sassen M.C. Seyberth H.W. Konrad M. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2894-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 34Hofmann T.

In each experiment, data from four to six single cells were averaged. Means ± S.E. were calculated from three to four independent transfections for each combination of CFP- and YFP-fused TRPM6/7 subunits. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Electrophysiological Techniques—M6pIND or M7pIND cells grown in 35-mm dishes to ∼70% confluence were induced with 5 μm ponasterone A for 18-24 h before performing electrophysiological experiments. For transient expression of TRPM6wt-GFP, TRPM6P1017R-YFP, TRPM7wt-GFP, and TRPM7P1040R-YFP in the pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector (Invitrogen) or TRPM7P1040R in pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech) in M7pIND cells, corresponding plasmid DNAs (2 μg/dish) were transfected with the FuGENE6 transfection reagent. ∼24 h after transfection, culture media were replaced by fresh media containing 5 μm ponasterone A. Only GFP- or YFP-positive cells were measured 18-24 h after induction. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were carried out at room temperature (22 °C). Cells were superfused with bath solution: 140 mm NaCl, 5mm CsCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Data from whole-cell recordings"
https://openalex.org/W2028236452,"Ca(2+) influx through NMDA receptors (NMDA-Rs) triggers synaptic plasticity, gene transcription, and cytotoxicity, but little is known about the regulation of NMDA-Rs themselves. We used two-photon glutamate uncaging to activate NMDA-Rs on individual dendritic spines in rat CA1 neurons while we measured NMDA-R currents at the soma and [Ca(2+)] changes in spines. Low-frequency uncaging trains induced Ca(2+)-dependent long-term depression of NMDA-R-mediated synaptic currents. Additionally, uncaging trains caused a reduction in the Ca(2+) accumulation per unit of NMDA-R current in spines due to a reduction in the fraction of the NMDA-R current carried by Ca(2+). Induction of depression of NMDA-R-mediated Ca(2+) influx required activation of NR2B-containing receptors. Receptors in single spines depressed rapidly in an all-or-none manner. These adaptive changes in NMDA-R function likely play a critical role in metaplasticity and in stabilizing activity levels in neuronal networks with Hebbian synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2099737129,"The role of the corpus callosum (CC) in the interhemispheric interaction of prosodic and syntactic information during speech comprehension was investigated in patients with lesions in the CC, and in healthy controls. The event-related brain potential experiment examined the effect of prosodic phrase structure on the processing of a verb whose argument structure matched or did not match the prior prosody-induced syntactic structure. While controls showed an N400-like effect for prosodically mismatching verb argument structures, thus indicating a stable interplay between prosody and syntax, patients with lesions in the posterior third of the CC did not show this effect. Because these patients displayed a prosody-independent semantic N400 effect, the present data indicate that the posterior third of the CC is the crucial neuroanatomical structure for the interhemispheric interplay of suprasegmental prosodic information and syntactic information."
https://openalex.org/W2160146828,"The neural circuitry that constrains visual acuity in the CNS has not been experimentally identified. We show here that zebrafish blumenkohl (blu) mutants are impaired in resolving rapid movements and fine spatial detail. The blu gene encodes a vesicular glutamate transporter expressed by retinal ganglion cells. Mutant retinotectal synapses release less glutamate, per vesicle and per terminal, and fatigue more quickly than wild-type in response to high-frequency stimulation. In addition, mutant axons arborize more extensively, thus increasing the number of synaptic terminals and effectively normalizing the combined input to postsynaptic cells in the tectum. This presumably homeostatic response results in larger receptive fields of tectal cells and a degradation of the retinotopic map. As predicted, mutants have a selective deficit in the capture of small prey objects, a behavior dependent on the tectum. Our studies successfully link the disruption of a synaptic protein to complex changes in neural circuitry and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2061266080,"Many studies have examined transcriptional regulation during the initiation of skeletal muscle differentiation; however, there is less information regarding transcriptional control during adult myogenesis and during the maintenance of the differentiated state. MyoD and the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling enzymes containing the Brg1 ATPase are necessary to induce myogenesis in cell culture models and in developing embryonic tissue, whereas myogenin and Brg1 are critical for the expression of the late genes that induce terminal muscle differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that myogenin also binds to its own promoter during the late stages of embryonic muscle development. As is the case during embryonic myogenesis, MyoD and Brg1 co-localize to the myogenin promoter in primary adult muscle satellite cells. However, in mature myofibers, myogenin and Brg1 are preferentially co-localized to the myogenin promoter. Thus, the myogenin promoter is occupied by different myogenic factors at different times of myogenesis. The relevance of myogenin in the continued expression from its own promoter is demonstrated in culture, where we show that myogenin, in the absence of MyoD, is capable of maintaining its own expression by recruiting the Brg1 ATPase to modify promoter chromatin structure and facilitate myogenin expression. Finally, we utilized in vivo electroporation to demonstrate that Brg1 is required for the continued production of the myogenin protein in newborn skeletal muscle tissue. These findings strongly suggest that the skeletal muscle phenotype is maintained by myogenin and the continuous activity of Brg1-based SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling enzymes.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 6Rhodes S.J. Konieczny S.F. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2050-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses of mice deficient for one or for different combinations of the MRFs have demonstrated that complex relationships exist between members of this family. In particular, there is significant redundancy of function in numerous parameters relating to the initiation of myogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 7Pownall M.E. Gustafsson M.K. Emerson Jr., C.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 747-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In contrast, gene knock-out analyses indicate that terminal differentiation specifically requires myogenin, as mice deficient for myogenin formed myoblasts but did not develop mature skeletal muscle tissue (8Hasty P.

Nature. 1993; 364: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Thus, myogenin is the only MRF that is absolutely required for skeletal muscle differentiation during embryogenesis, and this requirement is manifested not for the initiation of myogenesis but instead for events associated with tissue formation. Recently, we demonstrated that myogenin, in cooperation with Mef2D and Brg1, directed the expression of myogenic late genes that specify the skeletal muscle phenotype in cell culture and in embryonic tissue (11Ohkawa Y. Marfella C.G. Imbalzano A.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that during the time of terminal differentiation and in post-differentiated skeletal muscle, myogenin might also bind to its own promoter and cooperate with Brg1 to regulate its own expression. This idea is further supported by prior cell culture experiments demonstrating that ectopic expression of myogenin in 10T1/2 cells could induce expression from the endogenous myogenin locus by an undefined mechanism (12Braun T. Bober E. Buschhausen-Denker G. Kohtz S. Grzeschik K.H. Arnold H.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3617-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 13Edmondson D.G. Brennan T.J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21343-21346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence to support this hypothesis by examining the occupancy and function of myogenin at its own promoter during embryonic and adult skeletal muscle differentiation and in culture and by functionally evaluating the requirement for Brg1 in myogenin expression in differentiated tissue. Preparation of Mouse Embryonic Tissue—Conditions were identical to those published previously (11Ohkawa Y. Marfella C.G. Imbalzano A.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Nuclei Isolation from Mouse Skeletal Muscle Satellite Cells and Myofibers—Unless noted, all procedures were performed at 4 °C. Skeletal muscle from the upper hind limbs of 4- to 6-week-old C57/BL6 mice was minced to ∼1 mm3 and digested with 110 units/ml collagenase type II (Invitrogen) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with agitation (14Asakura A. Komaki M. Rudnicki M. Differentiation. 2001; 68: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 15Cornelison D.D. Wold B.J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) and filtered using a 70-μm cell strainer (352350; BD Biosciences) (16Olguin H.C. Olwin B.B. Dev. Biol. 2004; 275: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Flowthrough material was enriched for satellite cells, while material that did not pass through the filter was enriched for myofibers. Aliquots of the separated fractions were taken for RNA isolation; the remainder was pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 7 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml cytochalasin B, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Following a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, nuclei were released by Dounce homogenization using the A pestle. Nuclei release was checked by Hoechst 33258 staining, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Nuclei were first resuspended in 2.5 volumes of 10 STM buffer (5 mm MgCl2,10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% sucrose, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and then 2 volumes of 2.0 m sucrose/10 mm Tris-HCl/5 mm MgCl2. The samples were overlaid onto 750 μl of 2.0 m sucrose/10 mm Tris-HCl/5 mm MgCl2 in a Beckman ultracentrifuge tube (number 344057) and spun at 116,140 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer +0.1% Nonidet P-40. 1.0% formaldehyde at room temperature was added for 5 min for cross-linking, and, following centrifugation at 13,500 × g, pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Thawed samples were resuspended in lysis buffer and sonicated. Cell Culture—The B22 cell line inducibly expressing ATPase-deficient, dominant negative Brg1 (17de La Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Hill D.A.

Cells were cultured for 4 days in the presence of tetracycline (dominant negative Brg1 repressed) or in the absence of tetracycline (dominant negative Brg1 expressed) and were infected at 50% confluence with the indicated retrovirus for 30 h. Low serum differentiation medium was then added (time 0) to induce myogenic differentiation (20de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat.

Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis—Reverse transcriptase PCR and quantitative PCR conditions were previously described (11Ohkawa Y. Marfella C.G. Imbalzano A.N.

Endogenous myogenin (Fig. 3A) was amplified in the 3′-non-coding region with 5′-CAA GTG TGC ACA TCT GTT CTA GTC TC-3′,5′-GTA TCA TCA GCA CAG GAG ACC TTG GT-3′. Quantitative PCR reactions shown on agarose gels were stopped in the linear range and visualized using SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed as described (11Ohkawa Y. Marfella C.G. Imbalzano A.N.

PCR amplification was quantified using a DNA Engine Opticon system (MJ Research). Restriction Enzyme Accessibility Assay (REAA)—REAA and detection of restricted DNA by a modified version of ligation-mediated PCR were described previously (11Ohkawa Y. Marfella C.G. Imbalzano A.N.

Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) were co-injected into the hind limb and electroporated with a CUY21EDIT square wave electroporator (Nepa Gene). Muscle tissue was analyzed 2 days after electroporation. Immunohistochemistry—The dissected mouse hind limb muscle was fixed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (PB) containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 5% sucrose for 4 h at 4 °C. After fixation, the sample was cryoprotected with 25% sucrose in 0.1 m PB and embedded in OCT compound. Frontal sections (10 μm thick) were prepared. The following procedures were carried out at room temperature. The sections were pretreated with blocking solution (5% normal goat serum, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm NaN3, 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h, incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-myogenin antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz) for 16 h, and incubated with the Alexa Fluor 546 secondary antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes) in blocking solution. Fluorescence images were obtained using an IX-71 fluorescent microscope (Olympus) and processed with Adobe Photoshop software. Our previous results indicated that at the time of expression in developing embryos, myogenic late genes that specify the skeletal muscle phenotype are predominantly bound by myogenin and Mef2D and that these factors cooperate with the Brg1 chromatin-remodeling enzyme to alter promoter chromatin structure and facilitate late gene expression (11Ohkawa Y. Marfella C.G. Imbalzano A.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Though multiple studies have examined the initiation of myogenin expression by MyoD, we recently demonstrated that both MyoD and myogenin could bind to the myogenin promoter in MyoD-differentiated fibroblasts 24 h post-differentiation (22de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y. Berkes C.A. Bergstrom D.A. Dacwag C.S. Tapscott S.J. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3997-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether myogenin was present at its own promoter in the developing embryo after the point at which MyoD had initiated gene expression. ChIP analysis of tissue samples at embryonic (E) 10.5 (body with head and internal organs removed), E12.5 (limb buds), and E14.5 (limb muscle) revealed that myogenin binding to the myogenin promoter could be observed at E12.5, with increased binding at E14.5 (Fig. 1). The kinetics of myogenin binding to the myogenin promoter precisely matched those of myogenin binding to late genes (11Ohkawa Y. Marfella C.G. Imbalzano A.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting that at the time myogenin binds to genomic sequences in developing tissue, it does not discriminate between the previously inactive late gene loci and the transcriptionally active myogenin locus. Tissue culture studies indicate that Brg1 is essential for the initiation of myogenin transcription (20de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 22de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y. Berkes C.A. Bergstrom D.A. Dacwag C.S. Tapscott S.J. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3997-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 26Simone C. Forcales S.V. Hill D.A. Imbalzano A.N. Latella L. Puri P.L. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar); as expected, Brg1 was present on the myogenin promoter at each of the embryonic stages examined (Fig. 1). We conclude that myogenin and Brg1 are present on the myogenin promoter at times when skeletal muscle tissue specification is occurring. Mature skeletal muscle tissue is comprised of differentiated myofibers, which are the functional component of the tissue, and satellite cells, which associate with individual myofibers and are capable of dividing and either fusing with existing myofibers or creating new myofibers. The satellite cell population mediates the formation and repair of skeletal muscle tissue following the completion of development (reviewed in Refs. 27Dhawan J. Rando T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 666-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 28Holterman C.E. Rudnicki M.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We separated satellite cells and mature myofibers from mouse hind limb muscles of 4- to 6-week-old mice and then isolated nuclei from the respective cell populations for molecular analyses of factor binding and chromatin accessibility. Nuclei were immediately utilized to isolate total RNA or were treated with cross-linking agents for ChIP analysis (Fig. 2A). Examination of marker gene expression permitted evaluation of the separation protocol. Proteins such as Pax3 and Pax7 are markers of satellite cells (29Conboy I.M. Rando T.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 30Seale P. Sabourin L.A. Girgis-Gabardo A. Mansouri A. Gruss P. Rudnicki M.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar), whereas the myogenic late gene products MCK and desmin are markers of differentiated skeletal muscle. The expression of these genes was enriched in the expected cell preparations (Fig. 2B). The satellite cell population is a pool containing both quiescent cells that are not expressing MyoD or muscle-specific markers and activated cells that express MyoD and have initiated differentiation but have not undergone cell fusion. Thus, both the satellite cells and the myofibers express mRNAs encoding the MyoD and myogenin transcriptional regulators (Fig. 2B). Prior work revealed that MyoD targets Brg1 to the myogenin promoter during the initiation of myogenesis in tissue culture models for skeletal muscle differentiation (22de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y. Berkes C.A. Bergstrom D.A. Dacwag C.S. Tapscott S.J. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3997-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 26Simone C. Forcales S.V. Hill D.A. Imbalzano A.N. Latella L. Puri P.L. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). ChIP analysis of the myogenin promoter showed that MyoD, not myogenin, bound along with Brg1 in satellite cells, suggesting that these two factors cooperate in the initiation of myogenin expression during adult myogenesis (Fig. 2C). In contrast, myogenin was preferentially associated with its own promoter in mature myofibers (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that myogenin binds to its own promoter in differentiated tissue, consistent with its appearance at times during embryogenesis when terminal differentiation is occurring or has already occurred (Fig. 1). Brg1 was also present on the myogenin promoter in myofibers, consistent with its presence on the promoter during the later stages of embryogenic myogenesis. The data suggest the possibility that activation of the myogenin gene is mediated by MyoD whereas maintenance of myogenin expression may be mediated by myogenin itself. To mechanistically address this possibility, we utilized MyoD-differentiated B22 cells, which are NIH3T3-derived cells that express an ATPase-deficient, dominant negative Brg1 protein in a tetracycline-suppressible manner (17de La Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Hill D.A. Guidi C.J. Stephenson R.O. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2839-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Previous work using this system demonstrated that MyoD-driven differentiation faithfully recapitulated the events that occur during the activation of myogenic late genes during embryogenesis (11Ohkawa Y. Marfella C.G. Imbalzano A.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We previously reported that MyoD binding to the myogenin promoter correlated with the changes in nuclease accessibility at the myogenin locus and activation of myogenin transcription (22de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y. Berkes C.A. Bergstrom D.A. Dacwag C.S. Tapscott S.J. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3997-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We also noted that both MyoD and myogenin could interact with the myogenin promoter in a Brg1-dependent manner 24 h after the initiation of differentiation (22de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y. Berkes C.A. Bergstrom D.A. Dacwag C.S. Tapscott S.J. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3997-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). ChIP experiments over a time course of MyoD-mediated differentiation confirmed our earlier results and further revealed that as differentiation progressed beyond 24 h, MyoD binding to the promoter diminished whereas myogenin binding was enhanced (Fig. 3A). This apparent transition from MyoD binding to the promoter at the onset of myogenin expression to myogenin binding as the cells completed the differentiation process is similar to the observations made regarding MyoD and myogenin binding to the myogenin promoter in satellite cells and myofibers. The ChIP data support the idea that myogenin, in combination with Mef2 and Brg1, is activating its own transcription at times subsequent to the initial activation of gene expression by MyoD and Brg1. To directly test this hypothesis, we ectopically expressed MyoD, myogenin, and Mef2D1b, the muscle-specific isoform of the Mef2D protein that is highly induced during myogenesis in vivo (11Ohkawa Y. Marfella C.G. Imbalzano A.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Martin J.F. Miano J.M. Hustad C.M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), alone or in combination, in B22 cells to determine whether the endogenous myogenin gene could be activated. As expected, MyoD stimulated myogenin expression in a Brg1-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Neither myogenin nor Mef2D1b alone could activate the myogenin gene; however, the combination of myogenin and Mef2D1b, in the presence of functional Brg1, could activate endogenous myogenin expression. Our previous data demonstrated that the combination of myogenin and Mef2D1b did not activate the endogenous MyoD, Myf5, or Mrf4 loci in NIH3T3-based cell lines (Refs. 11Ohkawa Y. Marfella C.G. Imbalzano A.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Roy K. de la Serna I.L. Imbalzano A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33818-33824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar and data not shown). Thus, expression from the endogenous myogenin locus is due solely to the activation potential of myogenin and Mef2D1b. ChIP experiments showed that the mechanism by which myogenin and Mef2D1b mediate myogenin expression is via recruitment of Brg1 to the myogenin promoter (Fig. 3C). The presence of Brg1 then mediated changes in chromatin structure at the myogenin locus, which are reflected as increases in restriction enzyme accessibility at a PvuII site upstream of the myogenin mRNA start site (Fig. 3D). Both MyoD and the combination of myogenin and Mef2D1b could recruit both the functional and ATPase-deficient, dominant negative forms of Brg1 to the promoter, but chromatin accessibility required functional Brg1. Thus, whereas myogenin is not believed to initiate its own expression in vivo, the data indicate that the myogenin protein, in conjunction with Mef2D1b, has the intrinsic ability to activate expression from the endogenous myogenin locus in the absence of MyoD. These data and the differential binding of MyoD and myogenin to the myogenin promoter in satellite cells and myofibers support the conclusion that myogenin and Mef2D1b are responsible for maintaining the expression of myogenin after the onset of myogenesis. We further note that though the data indicate a role for myogenin in maintaining its own expression, a prior report has shown that the loss of myogenin in postnatal mice does not impact skeletal muscle formation (9Knapp J.R. Davie J.K. Myer A. Meadows E. Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Development. 2006; 133: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, myogenin is not required to maintain expression from the myogenin locus nor is it required for any skeletal muscle-specific function. These data strongly suggest that there are redundant factors that can compensate for the loss of myogenin during adult myogenesis. The involvement of the Brg1 SWI/SNF ATPase in the initiation of myogenesis in culture and during embryogenesis is well established (11Ohkawa Y. Marfella C.G. Imbalzano A.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Roy K. de la Serna I.L. Imbalzano A.N. J. Biol.

Genet. 2004; 36: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest that Brg1 function is also required in differentiated tissue, but detailed information about the in vivo relevance of Brg1 function in myogenesis in the mouse has been difficult to obtain because knock out of the Brg1 locus results in early embryonic lethality (32Bultman S. Gebuhr T. Yee D. La Mantia C. Nicholson J. Gilliam A. Randazzo F. Metzger D. Chambon P. Crabtree G. Magnuson T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1287-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we adapted an in vivo electroporation protocol (24Saito T. Nakatsuji N. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) to directly deliver plasmid DNAs encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a Brg1 allele containing a mutated ATP binding site to differentiated muscle tissue in the hind limb of a postnatal day 2 (P2) mouse. This ATPase-deficient protein has been characterized extensively and acts as a dominant negative by interfering with normal Brg1-dependent functions (17de La Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Hill D.A. Guidi C.J. Stephenson R.O. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2839-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25Khavari P.A. Peterson C.L. Tamkun J.W. Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Tissue isolated 48 h post-electroporation revealed that nuclei showing GFP fluorescence (Fig. 4A, white arrow) did not express myogenin protein. Conversely, nuclei that did not take up plasmid DNA showed no GFP fluorescence but immunostained for myogenin (yellow arrow). Control experiments where GFP alone was electroporated showed that cells expressing GFP also expressed myogenin (Fig. 4B). Quantification of these results revealed that introduction of dominant negative Brg1 inhibited myogenin expression in ∼90% of electroporated nuclei (Fig. 4C). The results demonstrate that functional Brg1 is required for expression of myogenin in fully differentiated skeletal muscle tissue. Thus, Brg1 is required for both the initiation and maintenance of myogenin gene expression in vivo. Our earlier work demonstrated that although MyoD was present on myogenic late gene regulatory sequences during embryogenesis prior to activation of these genes, the predominant factors present at the time of late gene expression in the developing tissue were myogenin and Mef2D, along with the chromatin-remodeling enzyme Brg1 (11Ohkawa Y. Marfella C.G. Imbalzano A.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if myogenin were being utilized to activate late gene expression during the time of terminal differentiation, it might also activate its own expression both at this time and following the completion of differentiation. Although there have been prior molecular studies examining the regulation of myogenin, we believe this is the first report to explore the relationship between specific MRF occupancy of promoters and the timing of differentiation in primary embryonic and adult tissue. The data support our hypothesis. ChIP analysis in embryonic tissue shows that myogenin binds the myogenin promoter with the same kinetics it binds to late gene promoters. Further support was derived from ChIP studies of adult satellite cells and myofibers, where the myogenin promoter in differentiating satellite cells was occupied by MyoD and the promoter in differentiated myofibers was predominantly bound by myogenin. This implies that when myogenin becomes competent to activate gene expression in the developing embryo or in differentiating adult tissue, there are no structural features associated with the myogenin promoter that distinguish it from the late gene loci. Based on these and earlier data, we propose that there is a transition in MRF binding during the terminal differentiation stages of embryonic and adult myogenesis. MyoD initially binds to both early and late myogenic genes, but activation of late genes is repressed due to the simultaneous presence of histone deacetylases and possibly other repressive chromatin-modifying enzymes at these loci (11Ohkawa Y. Marfella C.G. Imbalzano A.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Following the induction of myogenin and Mef2 family members by MyoD, these factors mediate the transcriptional activation of late genes that specify muscle formation and the continued transcription of early myogenic genes such as myogenin. This model is presented schematically in Fig. 5. Such a model is both similar to and different from the conclusions of previous studies. Prior work comparing the activation domains of MyoD and myogenin in culture led to a model of sequential functions at some genes by MyoD and then myogenin (33Bergstrom D.A. Tapscott S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2404-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, genome-wide factor binding studies, where analyzed regulatory sequences were identified as targets of MyoD, myogenin, or both (34Blais A. Tsikitis M. Acosta-Alvear D. Sharan R. Kluger Y. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 553-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 35Cao Y. Kumar R.M. Penn B.H. Berkes C.A. Kooperberg C. Boyer L.A. Young R.A. Tapscott S.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), were more recently used to conclude that the myogenic genes identified as targets of both MyoD and myogenin are cooperatively regulated by these MRFs. Although the concept of cooperative regulation could encompass either sequential or simultaneous binding by MyoD and myogenin, we note that the cell culture data shown here and previously (11Ohkawa Y. Marfella C.G. Imbalzano A.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) demonstrate that myogenin, in the presence of Mef2D, is capable of initiating and maintaining its own transcription and that of the rest of the myogenic genes without cooperative effects by MyoD or any other MRF. Further support for sequential function was recently provided by studies of the E box binding factor HEB, which can heterodimerize with MRFs. That study demonstrated that HEB acted synergistically with MyoD to activate transcription in cell culture at the onset of differentiation but synergized with myogenin following differentiation (36Parker M.H. Perry R.L. Fauteux M.C. Berkes C.A. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although the data support the idea that myogenin is the relevant factor in maintaining its own expression, it is clearly not required for this function. Early studies demonstrated that a myogenin-lacZ transgene was expressed normally in myogenin null mice (37Cheng T.C. Tseng B.S. Merlie J.P. Klein W.H. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and recent analysis of a conditional myogenin knock-out mouse indicated that loss of myogenin after myogenesis affected body size but no skeletal muscle deficiencies were observed (9Knapp J.R. Davie J.K. Myer A. Meadows E. Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Development. 2006; 133: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike during embryonic myogenesis, functional redundancy by other factors, presumably MRFs, can compensate for the lack of myogenin in adult tissues. In contrast, the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling enzyme is required for continued expression of myogenin in differentiated tissue. Multiple reports show the requirement for SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling function in culture, and the presence of SWI/SNF subunits on gene regulatory sequences in cultured cells and primary tissue (11Ohkawa Y.

Here we provide the first in vivo evidence that the SWI/SNF enzymes are required for myogenic gene expression in differentiated muscle tissue. In combination with earlier cell culture studies, we suggest that Brg1 and SWI/SNF enzymes are required continuously throughout every stage of adult and embryonic myogenesis.

However, STAT3 is activated by multiple factors that do not share the anti-inflammatory activity of IL-10. The question remains whether STAT3 is sufficient for the anti-inflammatory effects or whether there are other signals required, as had been suggested previously. We set out to map the human IL-10 receptor and to identify the key elements involved in transducing the cytokine-suppressive effects of IL-10. We were able to show an absolute requirement for both of the tyrosine residues found within the YXXQ-STAT3-docking site within the IL-10 receptor 1 and that no other signals appeared to be required. We used a constitutively active STAT3 to determine whether expression of this factor could suppress lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor and IL-6 production. Our data show that STAT3 activity can suppress both IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. However, in synovial fibroblasts, STAT3 did not suppress IL-6 production, suggesting that the cellular environment plays an important role in dictating whether STAT3 drives a pro- or anti-inflammatory response.

Inflammation is a key aspect of the host defense against infection and injury. However, if prolonged the inflammatory response can have deleterious effects on the host as seen in chronic auto-inflammatory conditions. Therefore, multiple mechanisms have evolved to regulate and curtail inflammatory responses.

It is also unclear whether the effects of IL-10 on cytokine expression are direct or require de novo gene expression (31Bogdan C. Paik J. Vodovotz Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 26723301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Aste-Amezaga M. Ma X. Sartori A. Trinchieri G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5936-5944PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, the induction of Bcl-3 expression has been proposed to be required, as murine macrophages deficient in this gene show no suppression of TNF production in response to IL-10 (33Kuwata H. Watanabe Y. Miyoshi H. Yamamoto M. Kaisho T. Takeda K. Akira S. Blood. 2003; 102: 4123-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been suggested that IL-10 simply antagonizes LPS-induced stabilization of mRNA as in the case of the chemokine KC (34Biswas R. Datta S. Gupta J.D. Novotny M. Tebo J. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6202-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). More recent data would suggest that the mechanism is indeed indirect as studies by Murray (35Murray P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8686-8691Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) have shown that IL-10 targets inflammatory gene transcription via the induction of intermediate gene(s) products.Despite the general diversity of mechanisms advocated for the anti-inflammatory activity of IL-10, there appears to be general agreement from knock-out mice and the use of dominant negative constructs that the Jak1/STAT3 axis is essential for this anti-inflammatory, as both Jak1 and STAT3 are utilized by many other cytokines that do not evoke the anti-inflammatory activity of IL-10. A previous study by Riley et al. (38Riley J.K. Takeda K. Akira S. Schreiber R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16513-16521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) using an IFN γ-IL-10 receptor chimera introduced into the murine cell line RAW264.7 suggested that an additional signal to STAT3, provided by a serine-rich region near the C terminus, was required to block TNF production. This view is supported by the observation that expression of a constitutively active STAT3 could not inhibit TNF production in murine dendritic cells (39Hoentjen F. Sartor R.B. Ozaki M. Jobin C. Blood. 2005; 105: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, what precise role this serine-rich region played has never been elucidated or confirmed. Neither have the possible confounding effects of using an interferon/IL-10 hybrid receptor been examined.In this study we have investigated which regions of the cytoplasmic domain of the human IL-10R are required for the regulation of TNF and IL-6 production in primary human macrophages and whether STAT3 is sufficient to mediate IL-10 function in this context. We could find no role for the C-terminal serine-rich region (38Riley J.K. Takeda K. Akira S. Schreiber R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16513-16521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and only deletion of both of the tyrosines that provide the STAT3-docking sites could ablate IL-10 signaling. To demonstrate that STAT3 is indeed both necessary and sufficient to mediate the anti-inflammatory response, we introduced a constitutively active form of STAT3 (STAT3C) into macrophages. STAT3C was able to mimic the inhibitory activity of IL-10, inhibiting LPS-induced TNF and IL-6 production but sparing IL-10 production and inducing Bcl-3 production. To our knowledge, these data are the first to show that STAT3 is the only signal required to convey the major anti-inflammatory activity of IL-10 within human myeloid cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—IL-10 was a kind gift from Schering Plough; macrophage colony-stimulating factor was a kind gift from Wyeth (Boston); Salmonella typhi LPS was purchased from Alexis (Dorset, UK); anti-HLA DR-CyChrom and Ig-conjugated CyChrom were purchased from BD Biosciences.

The full-length m/hIL-10RI chimeric construct was generated through the introduction of an SspI restriction enzyme site in the membrane-proximal sequence of the 5′ section of the mIL-10R1 and the 3′ section of the hIL-10R1 using primers 5′Mur and 3′HumSspI. The PCR fragments were cloned into an intermediate blunt-end cloning vector, using the pCR Blunt II vector and TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). The 5′ primer contained an NheI, and all 3′ primers contained a HindIII site to allow directional subcloning of the PCR fragment.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on full-length m/h IL-10RI using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. The m/hIL10RI Tyr-446/496 was generated through two rounds of site-directed mutagenesis, the first with the Tyr-446 and the second with the Tyr 496 primers. All standard PCRs were carried out at 4 min at 92 °C and then 35 cycles for 30 s at 92 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 2 min at 72 °C per cycle, and then 10 min at 72 °C.

Macrophages were routinely infected with virus at the stated multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) for 1 h in serum-free medium. Cells were washed and recultured in growth medium with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum for 24 h.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Stimulated cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na2VO4, 0.5 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) for 10 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and for immunoprecipitation purposes were pre-cleared with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). STAT3C was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) for 2 h followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed three times in 1 ml of Triton lysis buffer. Samples were separated by electrophoresis through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) that were blocked for 1 h with blocking buffer (5% w/v fat-free milk, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS) followed by 1 h of incubation with the antibodies, diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer. Antibodies used were anti-Tyr-705 phospho-STAT3 and anti-STAT3 (New England Biolabs), anti-β-tubulin (Sigma), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-HA (Covance, CA), anti-Bcl-3, and anti-SOCS3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was used as secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:2000. Bound antibody was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized using Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences).Quantitation of Gene Expression by Real Time TaqMan RT-PCR—RNA was isolated using a Qiagen RNA blood isolation kit (Qiagen. Ltd., Crawley, UK). TaqMan RT-PCR core reagent kit, TNF, IL-6, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primer/probe mixtures were purchased from PE Biosystems (Warrington, Cheshire, UK). An ABI PRISM 7700 detector sequence was programmed for the initial step of 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Relative quantitation of gene expression was determined using the comparative CT method. All calculations followed procedures outlined in ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detective system bulletin 2.Luciferase Assays—After stimulation, cells were washed once in PBS and lysed with 100 μl of CAT lysis buffer (0.65% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl). 50 μl of cell lysate was transferred into the well of a luminometer cuvette strip containing 120 μl of luciferase assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgCl2, 15% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Luciferase activity was measured with a Labsystem luminometer by dispensing 30 μl of luciferin (Bright-Glo luciferase assay system; Promega) per assay point. Cell lysates were assayed for protein concentration by the Bradford assay, and luciferase activity was adjusted accordingly.FACS Analysis—Macrophages were seeded at 106 cells/well and infected at an m.o.i. of 100 with Ad GFP, Ad m/h-IL-10RI chimera, or the Ad IL-10RI mutants and left to express overnight. The cells were detached with Accutase (PAA Laboratories, Yeovil, UK) and were blocked in FACS wash buffer (PBS, 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 0.025% (v/v) NaN3, 2 mm EDTA). Cell surface expression of adenovirally expressed m/hIL-10R1 receptors was assessed using a monoclonal rat anti-mouse IL-10R1 antibody (clone 1B1.3a) kindly donated by Dr. Kevin Moore, DNAX Inc., Palo Alto, CA. 1B1.3a was biotinylated using the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC biotinylation kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated with either 1B1.3a or biotinylated isotype control (Serotech, Kidlington, Oxon, UK) followed by incubation with streptavidin Per-CP (Pharmingen). Cells were analyzed on a BD Biosciences LSR FACScan.RESULTSRationale and Design of Chimeric Murine/Human IL-10R1 Adenoviral Constructs—This study was performed in primary human macrophages to ensure the greatest relevance to human physiology as possible. To identify functionally critical amino acid residues within the intracellular domain of the IL-10RI, we generated a number of chimeric receptors. These consisted of the murine IL-10RI extracellular domains that were fused with the human IL-10RI chain in an 8-amino acid sequence (QYFTVTN), just proximal of the transmembrane region (n = amino acid residue 238 of the murine receptor), which is identical between species (Fig. 1a). The resulting chimeric receptor should be sensitive to stimulation by both murine and human IL-10, whereas the endogenously expressed human IL-10R is only sensitive to human IL-10. Therefore, by using murine IL-10 to stimulate cells, any effect of the endogenous human IL-10R would be avoided, allowing us to specifically analyze the effects of any mutations we care to introduce. Using this construct as a backbone, a series of mutations and deletions were generated to map the cytoplasmic domain of the human receptor (Fig. 1a). In particular, the (only) two tyrosine residues within a YXXQ motif at 446 and 496 were mutated to phenylalanine (Y446F, Y496F, and Y446F/Y496F). These tyrosines correspond to Tyr-427 and Tyr-477 in the murine receptor which have been shown previously to serve as docking sites for the recruitment of STAT3 (24Weber-Nordt R.M. Riley J.K.

Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). We also wanted to investigate whether the homologous four serine residues identified by Riley et al. (38Riley J.K. Takeda K. Akira S. Schreiber R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16513-16521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) near the C terminus of the murine receptor were also important. A truncation was made to remove these from the human IL-10R. In addition, a serine → alanine mutant of these homologous four serine residues in the human IL-10R1 was also constructed truncated after amino acid 579 (see “Experimental Procedures”). To achieve efficient expression of the murine/human IL-10R constructs in human macrophages, they were inserted into adenoviral vectors. As shown in Fig. 1b, using an anti-murine IL-10R1-specific antibody, we were able to detect expression of all chimeric receptors in the human macrophages.IL-10-induced STAT3 Phosphorylation and SOCS3 Induction in m/h IL-10RI Chimera-infected Cells—To function as a signaling receptor, the IL-10R1 has to associate with the ubiquitously expressed IL-10R2. Because it was not possible to assess the assembly of such a complex with the m/h chimeras, we used the activation of signaling activity as an indicator of chimera function. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is by far the strongest immediate effect of IL-10 signaling, and this was therefore used to test for m/h IL-10R function. In addition, a second readout of IL-10 signaling, the induction of SOCS3 expression, was also assayed. Both the phosphorylation of STAT3 and the induction of SOCS3 were assayed by Western blot. Macrophages infected with a control virus (Ad GFP) (as expected) did not respond to murine IL-10 but did respond to human IL-10 as judged by phosphorylation of STAT3 or the induction of SOCS3 gene expression (Fig. 2, a and b). In contrast, infection with the construct containing the full-length m/h chimera resulted in cells becoming responsive to murine IL-10 as judged by the phosphorylation of STAT3 and SOCS3 expression (Fig. 2, a and b). Constructs containing single mutations at Tyr-446 or Tyr-496 and the serine-rich region were also still responsive to murine IL-10 as shown by the same criteria. However, the double mutation of both tyrosines Y446F/Y496F and the complete cytoplasmic deletion abolished STAT3 (Tyr-705) phosphorylation and the induction of SOCS3 expression (Fig. 2, a and b).FIGURE 2IL-10-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and SOCS3 induction in m/h IL-10R1 chimera-infected cells. 1 × 106 macrophages were left uninfected or infected at an m.o.i. of 100 with Ad GFP, Ad m/h-IL-10R1, the Tyr-446 mutant (Y446F), Tyr-496 mutant (Y496F), the double Tyr mutant Tyr-446/496, and the C-terminal serine-rich region deletion (Ser-RD) mutants for 1 h. The virus was then removed and then left to express overnight. The next day cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with either human (10 ng/ml) or murine IL-10 (50 ng/ml) for 2 h. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting, and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 was detected using a Tyr-705 phospho-specific antibody (a) and SOCS3 expression via SOCS3-specific antibodies (b). The blots were stripped and reprobed for β-tubulin (c) to ensure equal loading. The figure is representative of at least three experiments performed. d, 1 × 105 macrophages were left uninfected or infected at an m.o.i. of 100 with Ad GFP adenovirus, m/h-IL-10RI chimera, or the m/h IL-10RI, the Tyr-446 mutant (Y446F), Tyr-496 mutant (Y496F), the double Tyr mutant Y446F/Y496F, the C-terminal serine-rich region deletion (Ser-RD) for 1 h, and the virus was removed and then left to express overnight. The next day cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml) (solid black bars) with either human (10 ng/ml) (empty bars) or murine IL-10 (50 ng/ml) (gray bars). Cell supernatants were harvested after 18 h and TNF (d) and IL-6 (e) levels were determined by ELISA.

We used the patch clamp technique applied to split-open cortical collecting ducts (CCDs) isolated from rats fed a normal potassium (NK) or low potassium (LK) diet to test the hypothesis that AngII directly inhibits ROMK channel activity. We found that AngII inhibited ROMK channel activity in LK but not NK rats in a dose-dependent manner. The AngII-induced reduction in channel activity was mediated by AT1 receptor (AT1R) binding, because pretreatment of CCDs with losartan but not PD123319 AT1 and AT2 receptor antagonists, respectively, blocked the response. Pretreatment of CCDs with U73122 and calphostin C, inhibitors of phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC), respectively, abolished the AngII-induced decrease in ROMK channel activity, confirming a role of the PLC-PKC pathway in this response. Studies by others suggest that AngII stimulates an Src family protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) via PKC-NADPH oxidase. PTK has been shown to regulate the ROMK channel. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase with diphenyliodonium abolished the inhibitory effect of AngII or the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate on ROMK channels. Suppression of PTK by herbimycin A significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of AngII on ROMK channel activity.

We conclude that AngII inhibits ROMK channel activity through PKC-, NADPH oxidase-, and PTK-dependent pathways under conditions of dietary potassium restriction. It is well established that urinary potassium excretion falls in the face of dietary potassium restriction (1Linas S.L. Peterson L.N. Anderson R.J. Aisenbrey G.A. Simon F.R. Berl T.

The prevalence of the ROMK channel in the CCD and its high open probability at the resting membrane potential (7Frindt G. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F143-F151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has led to the belief that this channel mediates potassium secretion under base-line conditions. In contrast, the maxi-K channel, activated by membrane stretch, depolarization, and increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration (8Pacha J. Frindt G. Sackin H. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F696-F705PubMed Google Scholar) has been proposed to mediate flow-stimulated potassium secretion (9Woda C.B. Bragin A. Kleyman T.R. Satlin L.M. Am. J.

The intratubular renin-angiotensin system plays a major role in the control of salt and water transport within the kidney. Dietary potassium restriction stimulates the release of renal renin and AngII (13Ray P.E. Suga S. Liu X.H. Huang X. Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 1850-1858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Wang C.T. Navar L.G. Mitchell K.D. J. Hypertens. 2003; 21: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). AngII exerts its physiological effects by binding to AT1 and AT2 receptors. AT1 receptor (AT1R) binding activates a number of signaling molecules, including PKC and PTK (cSrc) (15Touyz R.M. Berry C. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 1001-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), whereas the precise nature of the signaling pathways activated by the AT2 receptor are still poorly understood (16Carey R.M. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2005; 14: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although the effect of AngII on the ROMK channel is unknown, luminal perfusion of distal tubules with AngII stimulates sodium absorption yet suppresses potassium secretion (17Wang T. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F143-F149PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that AngII may inhibit apical K channels in the CCD. The purpose of the present study was to directly test whether AngII regulates ROMK channel activity in the CCD. Using an electrophysiological approach (patch clamp technique), we have shown that AngII significantly inhibits ROMK channel activity in tubules isolated from rats fed a low potassium (LK) diet and that this effect is mediated by the AT1R. Furthermore, our studies identify a novel pathway involving NADPH oxidase by which AngII regulates the ROMK channel and thus urinary potassium excretion during dietary potassium restriction. Preparation of CCDs—Pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rats of either sex (5–6 weeks old; Taconic Farms, Inc., Germantown, NY) were fed either a normal potassium (NK; standard rat chow, Laboratory Diet, 1.1% w/w potassium content) or a low potassium (LK; Harland, 0.001–0.003% w/w potassium content) diet for 4–8 days. Animals were allowed free access to tap water. In one series of experiments, either losartan (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (ethanol in 4:1,000 final dilutions) was added to the drinking water. Animal use protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of New York Medical College and Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Rats were killed by cervical dislocation. Kidneys were immediately removed, and several thin coronal slices were cut with a razor blade and placed in ice-cold Ringer’s solution for microdissection of CCDs, as previously described (18Wei Y. Babilonia E. Sterling H. Jin Y. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F1065-F1071Google Scholar). The Ringer’s solution contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1.8 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). To immobilize tubules for patch clamp or immunolabeling, CCDs were affixed to 5 × 5 mm coverglasses coated with poly-d-lysine. Patch Clamp Recording—The basic patch clamp methods have been described previously (18Wei Y. Babilonia E. Sterling H. Jin Y. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F1065-F1071Google Scholar). In brief, each isolated CCD affixed to a coverglass was transferred to a chamber (1000 μl total volume) mounted on the stage of a Nikon inverted microscope. The chamber was filled with Ringer’s solution. The CCD was cut open with a sharpened micropipette to expose the apical membrane. Patch clamp pipettes were pulled using a vertical pipette puller (model PP-83; Narishige Scientific Instrument Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan) in two stages with borosilicate glass capillaries (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). The pipettes were fire-polished and had resistances of 2–5 MΩ when filled with a solution containing (in mm) 140 KCl, 1.8 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). Experiments were performed at room temperature. Currents originating in each cell-attached patch were recorded using an Axon200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon instruments Inc.). The currents were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz. Data were digitized using an Axon interface (Digidata 1200) and stored on the hard drive of an equipped computer. Immunohistochemical Staining and Confocal Microscopy—Isolated CCDs affixed to a coverglass, as described above, were fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde prepared in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 0.05% picric acid (pH 7.4) for 2–3 min and then rinsed with base buffer (1× PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% glycine). Thereafter, tubules were permeabilized with permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100 dissolved in the base buffer) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-AT1R antibody (1:200 dilution in permeabilization solution) overnight at 4 °C. Tubules were rinsed three times with the base buffer and then incubated for 1 h with a goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa-488 at a 1:1000 dilution in 1× PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature. After rinsing with three volumes of 1× PBS, the tubules were co-labeled with the principal cell marker, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA, conjugated to rhodamine; 1:200 dilution in 1× PBS) by incubation for 30 min at room temperature. Following a final rinse, a single drop of antifade reagent was deposited on each tubule, and the coverglass was sealed onto the slide with clear nail polish. Fluorescence imaging was performed with an inverted Zeiss laser scanning microscope (LSM; 510-META) using a ×40 oil immersion objective. All images were saved in a tag information file format (TIFF). Relative Quantitation of p22phox and p47phox mRNA in Single CCDs—CCDs were microdissected in 1× PBS containing 10 mm vanadyl ribonucleoside complexes for no longer than 1 h after the death of the animal. Approximately 10 mm total length of CCDs was pooled for each sample. RNA was extracted from the microdissected CCDs and cDNA synthesized using oligo(dT) primers as described previously (19Woda C.B.

Both p22phox and p47phox transcript expression were analyzed by semiquantitative real time PCR using the TaqMan™ technique and an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Both primers and probes for p22phox and p47phox were synthesized by Applied Biosystems (Table 1) based on the sequences reported for GenBank™ accession numbers U18729 and AY029167, respectively. The 5′ end of each probe was labeled with 6-FAM dye, and the 3′ end was labeled with carboxytetramethylrhodamine. GAPDH was chosen as the internal positive reference control; TaqMan™ rodent GAPDH primers and probes were obtained from Applied Biosystems.TABLE 1Primers and probes used for real-time PCRp22phox Forward5′–ACCTGACCGCTGTGGTGAA–3′ Reverse5′–GTGGAGGACAGCCCGGA–3′ Probe5′–6FAM–CTGTTCGGGCCCCTCACCAGAAATTACT–TAMRA–3′P47phox Forward5′–ACGCTCACCGAGTACTTCAACA–3′ Reverse5′–TCATCGGGCCGCACTTT–3′ Probe5′–6FAM–CCCGCTGCCCACACCTCTTGAACT–TAMRA–3′ Open table in a new tab Real-time PCR was performed as follows. To 2 μl of cDNA sample was added 8 μl of a mixture containing 0.05 μl of Platinum TaqDNA® polymerase, 0.1 unit AmpErase uracil N-glycosylase (UNG), dNTPs with dUTP, 0.2 μl of passive reference ROX dye 0.2 μl (20 pm) of forward and reverse primers, and TaqMan™ probe, finally adding nuclease-free water to a total volume of 10 μl. Each plate was then covered with optical adhesive film, and after the initial steps of 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s (melt) and 60 °C for 1 min (anneal/extend) were performed. Chemicals—Herbimycin A (HA), U73122, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were purchased from Biomol Corp. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Diphenyliodonium (IDP) was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Losartan was a generous gift from Dr. Charles T. Stier (New York Medical College). AngII, PD123319, calphostin C, and other chemicals, including vanadyl ribonucleoside complexes, were purchased from Sigma. The anti-AT1R antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was purchased from Invitrogen and rhodamine-conjugated DBA from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). The antifade reagent (Prolong Gold) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). Platinum TaqDNA® polymerase and passive reference ROX dye were purchased from Invitrogen and AmpErase UNG® and dNTPs with dUTP from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Data Analysis and Statistics—Data are all expressed as mean ± S.E.; n equals the number of cell-attached patches or animals for real-time PCR. Patch clamp data were analyzed by using the pCLAMP software system version 6.04 (Axon Instrument, Burlingame, CA). Channel activity was defined as NPo, the product of open probability (Po) and channel number (N), which was calculated from data samples of 60-s duration in the steady state as follows: NPo =Σ(t1 + 2t2 +···iti), where ti was the fractional open time spent at each of the observed current levels. Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc., Chicago, IL). A paired or unpaired Student’s t test was performed to determine statistical significance, as appropriate. Real-time PCR data were analyzed using SDS version 2.1 software for calculation of the threshold values (CT) of p22phox and p47phox. Using the 2-ΔΔCT method (20Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127160) Google Scholar), the data are represented as the fold change in mRNA expression, normalized to GAPDH, relative to the control. The standard deviation of differences was calculated from the standard deviations (S.D.) of the p22phox, p47phox, and GAPDH values using the formula s=S12+S22. Statistical significance was taken as p < 0.05. We used the patch clamp technique to study the effect of AngII on the ROMK channel in principal cells of the CCD. AngII significantly inhibited ROMK channel activity (NPo) in LK-fed animals in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 1 and 2). AngII in concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 nm reduced NPo by 45 ± 16% (n = 8, p < 0.05), 58 ± 20% (n = 6, p < 0.05) and 70 ± 15% (n = 10, p < 0.01), respectively. This inhibitory effect on channel activity was partially reversible when AngII was washed out from the bathing solution (Fig. 1). However, AngII was without a consistent effect in CCDs isolated from rats fed a NK diet; only 2 of 7 patches responded to 100 nm AngII with a reduction in ROMK channel activity.FIGURE 2Dose-response curves for the AngII-induced inhibition of the ROMK channel in CCDs. AngII led to a reduction in NPo of ROMK channels in CCDs from LK (open circles)-but not from NK (closed circles)-fed rats at concentrations ≥ 1 nm. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 versus 0.1 nm AngII. #, p < 0.05 versus 100 nm AngII in NK-fed rats only.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify which subtype of AngII receptor (AT1 or AT2) mediated the inhibitory effect of AngII on the ROMK channel, CCDs from LK rats were pretreated with losartan (20 μm), an AT1R antagonist, before exposure to AngII. Losartan completely abolished the inhibitory effect of AngII on the ROMK channel (n = 9, p = NS (not significant)) (Fig. 3, A and B). In CCDs pretreated with the AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319 (10 μm), AngII reduced ROMK channel activity by 75 ± 17% (n = 6, p < 0.05), a degree of inhibition identical to that observed in CCDs not treated with any receptor antagonist (Fig. 3B). To confirm the presence of the AT1R and determine its localization in the CCD of LK rats, we performed immunofluorescence labeling of isolated nephron segments using antibodies directed against the AT1R, visualized with an Alexa-488-conjugated secondary antibody. Antibody binding was present along the apical membranes of cells that expressed DBA, a principal cell-specific marker. We observed abundant apical expression of immunodetectable AT1R in tubules isolated from LK-fed rats (Fig. 4). Immunolabeling of CCDs isolated from NK rats (n = 20 tubules from four animals) using a protocol identical to that in CCDs from LK rats showed inconsistent and weak apical expression (data not shown). To test the in vivo relevance of the in vitro observation of AngII-induced inhibition of the ROMK channel activity, the effect of oral administration of losartan (10 mg/kg/day) to LK-fed rats for 6–8 days of treatment was examined. We found that ROMK channel activity (NPo) in CCDs from losartan-treated animals (1.75 ± 0.26, n = 16) significantly exceeded that measured in vehicle-treated animals (0.85 ± 0.26, n = 12, p <+0.05) (Fig. 3C). These results support the notion that AngII plays a physiologically relevant role in regulating channel activity in vivo. An early event following AngII binding to the AT1R is activation of phospholipase C (PLC) leading to stimulation of PKC (15Touyz R.M. Berry C. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 1001-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Activation of PKC has previously been reported to inhibit the ROMK channel (21Wang W.H. Giebisch G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9722-9725Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In fact, we confirmed that PMA (10 μm), an agonist of PKC, inhibited ROMK channel activity by 51 ± 12% (n = 7, p < 0.01) (Fig. 5). To test whether the AngII-induced inhibition of ROMK channel activity was mediated by activation of the PLC-PKC pathway, we first examined the effect of AngII on ROMK channels in CCDs pretreated with U73122 (10 μm), an inhibitor of PLCβ. Application of U73122 alone had no effect on ROMK channel activity. However, in U73122-pretreated tubules, AngII failed to inhibit channel activity (n = 9, p = NS) (Fig. 5). We next sought to confirm the role of PKC in the AngII response. The addition of PMA to CCDs pretreated, as above, with U73122 and AngII led to the inhibition of ROMK channel activity by 69 ± 16% (n = 6, p < 0.05) (Fig. 5). To further explore the role of PKC in the AngII response, CCDs were treated with calphostin C (100 nm), an inhibitor of PKC, which alone had no effect on ROMK channel activity (Fig. 5), as we have previously reported (22Sterling H. Lin D.H. Chen Y.J. Wei Y. Wang Z.J. Lai J. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F1072-F1078Google Scholar). AngII failed to reduce the NPo in calphostin C-treated CCDs (n = 9, p = NS) (Fig. 5). These data strongly suggest a role of PLC and PKC in the AngII-induced inhibition of ROMK channel activity. We have previously reported that the reduction in number of apical ROMK channels in LK animals is due to an increase in PTK (cSrc) activity, which enhances endocytosis of the channel (23Moral Z. Dong K. Wei Y. Sterling H. Deng H. Ali S. Gu R. Huang X.Y. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7156-7163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We confirmed that inhibition of cSrc with HA (1 μm) increases NPo of the channel (Fig. 6) (24Wei Y. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F680-F686Google Scholar). cSrc is stimulated by AngII in vascular smooth muscle cells (25Ishida M. Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Ishida T. Bernstein K.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To examine whether the AngII-mediated effects on the ROMK channel involves PTK signaling, CCDs were pretreated with HA to inhibit cSrc, and the effect of AngII on channel activity was examined. In HA-treated CCDs, AngII significantly reduced ROMK channel activity (n = 5, p < 0.05 versus HA-treated or untreated control CCDs). The AngII-induced PTK-independent reduction of ROMK channel activity presumably reflects other PKC-associated effects on the channel, such as that regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (26Zeng W.Z. Li X.J. Hilgemann D.W. Huang C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16852-16856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Of note was our observation that application of PMA to HA-treated CCDs failed to inhibit the ROMK channel (data not shown), suggesting that PTK is required for activation of PKC (27Braiman L. Sheffi-Friedman L. Bak A. Tennenbaum T. Sampson S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1922-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 28Rosenzweig T. Aga-Mizrachi S. Bak A. Sampson S.R. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). cSrc has been reported to be a downstream signal of reactive oxygen species (ROS, including O2−, H2O2) (29Frank G.D. Eguchi S. Yamakawa T. Tanaka S. Inagami T. Motley E.D. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3120-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). O2− and related products are increased in CCDs during dietary potassium restriction (30Babilonia E. Wei Y. Sterling H. Kaminski P. Wolin M. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10790-10796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Decreasing O2− by tempol, a scavenger of O2− anions, reduces expression of cSrc in CCDs, which increases ROMK channel activity and potassium excretion in LK rats (30Babilonia E. Wei Y. Sterling H. Kaminski P. Wolin M. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10790-10796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The immunodetection of components of NADPH oxidase in the CCD suggests that NADPH oxidase may be a source of intracellular ROS in this nephron segment (31Chabrashvili T. Tojo A. Onozato M.L. Kitiyakara C. Quinn M.T. Fujita T. Welch W.J. Wilcox C.S. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). AngII stimulates O2− production by activating NADPH oxidase via AT1R in kidneys (32Chabrashvili T. Kitiyakara C. Blau J. Karber A. Aslam S. Welch W.J. Wilcox C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: R117-R124Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). If AngII activates this signaling pathway in the CCD, blockade of NADPH oxidase should abolish the effect of AngII on the ROMK channel. We used IDP (10 μm), a specific inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, to explore the role of this pathway in the AngII-induced reduction of ROMK channel activity. The inhibitory effect of AngII on the channel was absent in CCDs pretreated with IDP (n = 7, p = NS) (Fig. 7). To confirm the role of NADPH oxidase in the AngII-mediated effect, we pretreated CCDs with apocynin (100 μm), which prevents the transfer of the soluble cytosolic subunits p47phox and p67phox of NADPH oxidase to the cell membrane and blocks the function of the enzyme (33Engels F. Renirie B.F. Hart B.A. Labadie R.P. Nijkamp F.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We found that apocynin also blocked the effect of AngII on the ROMK channel (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7The inhibitory effect of AngII on ROMK channel activity is mediated, in part, by NADPH oxidase. A, pretreatment of CCDs from LK rats with one of two NADPH oxidase inhibitors, IDP (10 μm) or apocynin (100 nm), blocked the effect of AngII on the ROMK channel. Neither one of these inhibitors had a significant effect on base-line channel activity. CCDs pretreated with IDP failed to respond to PMA with an inhibition of ROMK channel activity, suggesting that AngII inhibits the channel via the activation of the PKC-NADPH oxidase pathway. B, relative expression of mRNA encoding p22phox and p47phox in CCDs from NK- and LK-fed rats. Dietary potassium restriction for 4–6 days increased expression of p47phox (but not p22phox) when compared with NK-fed rats.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that NADPH oxidase plays a role in the adaptation to a LK diet, we compared mRNA levels of both p22phox and p47phox in single CCDs isolated from LK (n = 3)- and NK (n = 3)-fed rats. We found that the p47phox mRNA transcript abundance in LK rats was 2.4-fold greater than that from NK rats (p < 0.05) (Fig. 7). PKC stimulates NADPH oxidase in neutrophils (34Cox J.A. Jeng A.Y. Sharkey N.A. Blumberg P.M. Tauber A.I. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 76: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To test whether PKC stimulates this oxidase in the CCD and regulates ROMK channel activity, tubules were pretreated with IDP and then exposed to PMA. The observation that PMA failed to inhibit the channel activity in IDP-treated CCDs (Fig. 7) provides support for the role of both PKC and NADPH oxidase in the AngII-mediated reduction in channel activity in LK rats. The results of the present in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that AngII plays an important role in the regulation of the ROMK channel in CCDs isolated from potassium-restricted animals. In this situation, AngII inhibits channel activity via a signaling cascade that is initiated by AT1R binding and involves activation of PLC-PKC, PTK, and NADPH oxidase (Fig. 8). We propose that this represents a novel pathway in regulating potassium secretion in the kidney. Dietary potassium intake is an important regulator of the ROMK channel, although its mechanism has not been fully clarified. Renal potassium secretion responds promptly to changes in dietary potassium intake (35Wang W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 547-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The reduction in potassium secretion in the distal nephron induced by dietary potassium restriction is achieved by a reduction in the number of ROMK channels resident in the apical membrane, a response mediated, at least in part, by PTK- and PKC-dependent pathways (11Wang W. Lerea K.M. Chan M. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F165-F171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sterling H. Lin D.H. Chen Y.J. Wei Y. Wang Z.J. Lai J. Wang W.H. Am. J.

Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Potassium depletion increases expression of Src family PTK, including cSrc, which phosphorylates ROMK channels, thereby enhancing their endocytosis and reducing potassium secretion (11Wang W. Lerea K.M. Chan M. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F165-F171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wei Y. Bloom P. Lin D. Gu R. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dietary potassium restriction is also associated with an increase in the expression of PKCε (11Wang W. Lerea K.M. Chan M. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F165-F171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of PKC by PMA inhibits ROMK channel activity (21Wang W.H. Giebisch G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9722-9725Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), presumably also by mediating the internalization of the channel (12Lin D. Sterling H. Lerea K.M. Giebisch G. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44278-44284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as well as by reducing the membrane content of PIP2, a membrane phospholipid required to maintain the open state of the channel (26Zeng W.Z.

https://openalex.org/W2027743939,"The type I B family of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKs) contain a characteristic region of Membrane Occupation and Recognition Nexus (MORN) motifs at the N terminus. These MORN motifs are not found in PIPKs from other eukaryotes. To understand the impact of the additional N-terminal domain on protein function and subcellular distribution, we expressed truncated and full-length versions of AtPIPK1, one member of this family of PIPKs, in Escherichia coli and in tobacco cells grown in suspension culture. Deletion of the N-terminal MORN domain (amino acids 1–251) of AtPIPK1 increased the specific activity of the remaining C-terminal peptide (ΔMORN) >4-fold and eliminated activation by phosphatidic acid (PtdOH). PtdOH activation could also be eliminated by mutating Pro396 to Ala (P396A) in the predicted linker region between the MORN and the kinase homology domains. AtPIPK1 is product-activated and the MORN domain binds PtdIns(4,5)P2. Adding back the MORN peptide to ΔMORN or to the PtdOH-activated full-length protein increased activity ∼2-fold. Furthermore, expressing the MORN domain in vivo increased the plasma membrane PtdInsP kinase activity. When cells were exposed to hyperosmotic stress, the MORN peptide redistributed from the plasma membrane to a lower phase or endomembrane fraction. In addition, endogenous PtdInsP kinase activity increased in the endomembrane fraction of hyperosmotically stressed cells. We conclude that the MORN peptide can regulate both the function and distribution of the enzyme in a manner that is sensitive to the lipid environment."
https://openalex.org/W2003608458,Animals can produce movements of widely varying speed and strength by changing the recruitment of motoneurons according to the well-known size principle. Much less is known about patterns of recruitment in the spinal interneurons that control motoneurons because of the difficulties of monitoring activity simultaneously in multiple interneurons of an identified class. Here we use electrophysiology in combination with in vivo calcium imaging of groups of identified excitatory spinal interneurons in larval zebrafish to explore how they are recruited during different forms of the escape response that fish use to avoid predators. Our evidence indicates that escape movements are graded largely by differences in the level of activity within an active pool of interneurons rather than by the recruitment of an inactive subset.
https://openalex.org/W2094066697,"Two parent clones of a gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) receptor, C12K32 and GHBh1, were isolated from a human frontal cortex cDNA library. The two clones differ by a deleted cytosine in C12K32. CHO cells transfected with either C12K32 or GHBh1 responded positively to submicromolar GHB stimulation. However, unlike C12K32, GHBh1 desensitizes rapidly on application of low concentrations of GHB. GHB receptor properties were then studied on C12K32 expressed in CHO cells. C12K32 bound GHB with a Kd of 114 nM and has no affinity for GABA or glutamate. GHB and NCS-382 displaced [3H]GHB with an IC50 of 53 +/- 8 and 120 +/- 18 nM, respectively. In patch-clamp experiments, GHB induced a dose-dependent response with an EC50 of 130 nM. This response was antagonized by NCS-382, was not reproduced by GABA, and was sensitive to the addition of GTP-gamma-S in the recording pipette. CHO cells transfected with C12K32 exhibited GTPgamma-35S binding with an EC50 of 462 nM for GHB and an IC50 of 2.9 microM for NCS-382. The present data led to the conclusion that both C12K32 and GHBh1 are two closely related isoforms of a human GHB receptor, GHBh1, that is described in the databank as the GPCR 172A."

The hydroxylysine residues formed have two important functions: they are essential for the stability of the intermolecular cross-links that provide the collagen fibrils with their tensile strength and mechanical stability, and they serve as attachment sites for carbohydrate units, either the monosaccharide galactose or the disaccharide glucosylgalactose (1Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Related Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). Collagen cross-link formation occurs in the extracellular matrix and is initiated by the conversion of specific lysine or hydroxylysine residues in the telopeptides, i.e. the short non-triple helical ends of collagen molecules, into the aldehydes allysine or hydroxyallysine, respectively, catalyzed by lysyl oxidase (8Kagan H.M. Li W. J. Cell Biochem. 2003; 88: 660-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The telopeptides are connected with the triple helical part of an adjacent molecule by difunctional immature cross-links in the characteristic staggered array of collagen molecules in a fibril. The three main fibril-forming collagens, types I, II, and III, have four cross-linking sites, one in each telopeptide and two in the triple helical region, close to its N- and C-terminal ends (9Eyre D.R. Wu J.-J. Top. Curr. Chem. 2005; 247: 207-229Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). If the residue in the telopeptide is hydroxyallysine, the difunctional cross-links can mature into trifunctional non-reducible cross-links comprising lysylpyridinolines (LPs), derived from one lysine and two hydroxylysines, and hydroxylysylpyridinolines (HPs) derived from three hydroxylysines. Pyridinoline cross-links are abundant in bone, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons, but much less frequent in the skin (9Eyre D.R. Wu J.-J. Top. Curr.

Analysis of bone samples from patients with this syndrome has demonstrated underhydroxylation of lysine residues in collagen telopeptides leading to aberrant cross-linking, while the lysines in the triple helical region are hydroxylated normally (20Bank R.A.

No mutations in the human PLOD3 gene for LH3 have been characterized, but homozygous inactivation of the mouse Plod3 gene is lethal at E9.5 because of an abnormal aggregation of basement membrane-specific collagen IV (11Rautavuoma K.

Biochemical data on patients with EDS VIA are currently limited almost entirely to the skin, where the hydroxylysine content is usually only about 5% of normal, whereas its content in the few bone and cartilage samples analyzed so far has been about 50 and 90%, respectively (13Steinmann B. Royce P.M. Superti-Furga A. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular, Genetic, and Medical Aspects. Wiley-Liss, New York2002: 431-523Crossref Google Scholar). These values suggest that the LH isoenzymes may differ in either expression or substrate specificities between tissues. We report here on the generation of mice with targeted inactivation of the Plod1 gene. The null mice were viable and fertile. They did not show kyphoscoliosis but were flaccid, a finding that resembles the muscular hypotonia of human EDS VIA. Sudden deaths, mainly due to aortic ruptures, were observed, especially among young null males. Ultrastructural analysis revealed alterations in collagen fibrils, and biochemical analyses demonstrated a deficiency in collagen hydroxylysine content and changes in the collagen cross-linking pattern, the extents of which varied markedly between tissues. Construction of the Targeting Vector and Gene Targeting in Embryonic Stem Cells—A clone containing the Plod1 gene was isolated from a murine 129SV genomic library (Stratagene) using a human LH1 cDNA fragment (2Hautala T. Byers M.G. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Genomics. 1992; 13: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) as a probe. The 1-kb short arm of the targeting construct (Fig. 1A) was generated by PCR with the genomic clone as a template, the 5′(forward) primer is the intron 1 sequence CTGGGTACCTCGAGCACGGTGTGCCAAGTGTC with an introduced KpnI restriction site (underlined), and the exon 2 sequence CAGTAAGCTTAGGTTGTGGACAGAGAAG as the 3′(reverse) primer. The long arm contained Plod1 exons 7–10 (Fig. 1A) and was isolated from the genomic clone as a 4.5-kb NcoI fragment. The lacZ-neo cassette (21Putaala H. Soininen R. Kilpeläinen P. Wartiovaara J. Tryggvason K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) was ligated into the short arm fragment so that the lacZ sequence was in-frame with the Plod1 sequences. The selection gene neo is regulated by the PGK promoter. Homologous recombination leads to deletion of a 5.5-kb Plod1 region containing exon 2, except for its first five nucleotides, with which the lacZ gene was fused, and exons 3–6 in their entirety. The linearized construct was introduced into W4 embryonic stem (ES) cells (Taconic) and colonies that survived G418 selection were screened by PCR using the forward primer CCATCAAGCAAGACTCAG from intron 1 of the Plod1 gene and the reverse primer CTGGATCTTGTAGTTGAAGAAC from exon 2 for the wild-type allele, and the same forward primer with the reverse primer ACCCTGCCATAAAGAAACTGT from the lacZ cassette for the mutant allele (Fig. 1A). Correct targeting in PCR positive cells was verified by Southern hybridization in which 20 μg of genomic DNA was digested with HindIII and hybridized with a probe generated by PCR from intron 10, a region outside the targeting construct (Fig. 1A). Generation of Mutant Mice—The correctly targeted clones were expanded and cells of three clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts that were transferred into pseudopregnant recipients. The resulting chimeric males were bred with C57BL/6 females, and the heterozygous offspring were further backcrossed into a C57BL/6 background. Most of the analyses were performed with mice backcrossed for 4–5 generations. Two targeted mouse lines were generated. The genotyping was routinely performed by PCR using the same primer pairs as for the ES cell screening, and the results in the first litters of heterozygote crosses were confirmed by Southern blotting. An ES Gene Trap cell line LH1: RST531, with a gene trap insertion in intron 11 of the Plod1 gene, produced by the Research Consortium BayGenomics, was obtained from the Mutant Mouse Resource Center at UC Davis. The cells were expanded, injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and heterozygous mice were generated as described above. Primers flanking the gene trap insertion site, a forward primer CCTGTGCCGTCAGGACC from exon 11 of Plod1 and a reverse primer CACGACGGCCCTGCAC from exon 12, producing a 500-bp fragment from the wild-type allele, and the same forward primer and a reverse primer CACTCCAACCTCCGCAAACTC from the lacZ gene, producing a 500-bp fragment from the gene trap allele, were used for genotyping. All the animal experiments were performed under an approved license from the Animal Ethical Committee of the University of Oulu. RT-PCR—For RNA isolation, hearts were quickly dissected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. Total RNA was isolated using the Tripure reagent (Roche Applied Science), dissolved in sterile water, and the concentration was estimated by UV spectroscopy. For RT-PCR, the first strand was synthesized with random hexamer primers using 100 ng of RNA as a template. One-tenth of the volume of the first strand reaction was used in the subsequent PCR with the Plod1-specific primers GAACGCACCACAAACTTC from exon 10 and ACAGACGGCCCTGCAC from exon 12, GCCCAGTTTGATCTAGCC from exon 18 and AGGGATCGACGAAAGACA from exon 19, and with the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3Pdh)-specific primers TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG and GACCACAGTCCATGCCATCACT. Histological Analysis—After sacrifice of the mice the tissues were dissected, rinsed briefly in 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4 (phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) and fixed in 10% formalin in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Autopsy samples were fixed in a similar manner. After rinsing in water, the tissues were transferred to 70% ethanol, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5–10 μm were cut and stained with hematoxylin-eosin or Masson’s trichrome method. For the detection of β-galactosidase activity, tissue sections were first rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline followed by fixation in 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2 in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, for 1 h. After washes in 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, the tissues were stained overnight at room temperature in 1 mg/ml X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside), 10 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 10 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, fixed and processed as described above and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Skin samples taken from the lower back and aortic samples from the descending aorta were fixed in a 1% glutaraldehyde and 4% formaldehyde mixture in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature for a minimum of 12 h and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide. The eyes were first fixed whole and punctured with a thin needle in the posterior after 1 h to ensure complete fixation. After several hours of fixation the corneas were dissected and processed as above. The samples were dehydrated in acetone and embedded in Epon Embed 812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). To select areas for further analysis, semithin sections were stained with toluidine blue and examined by light microscopy. Thin sections (80 nm) were then cut with a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope. Images were captured using a CCD camera. Fibril diameters were measured in the region subjacent to the epidermis of the skin and in the media subjacent to the adventitia of the aorta with an original magnification of ×24,000 and analyzed with TCL-EM-Menu version 3 (Tietz Video and Image Processing Systems GmbH, Gaunting, Germany). The diameters of fibrils located on the transverse line of each image were measured so that altogether 300–361 fibrils on about 30 images were analyzed for each sample. Assay of LH Activity—LH activity in the mouse tissues was assayed by a method based on the formation of hydroxy[14C]lysine in protocollagen, a biologically prepared [14C]lysine-labeled substrate consisting of non-hydroxylated polypeptide chains of chick type I procollagen (22Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Tissues from 1.5–3.5-month-old mice were homogenized in 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 50 μm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5 at 4 °C, centrifuged, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants determined with the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Three amounts of the supernatants (50, 100, and 200 μg) were used in duplicates for the activity measurements. Cross-link and Amino Acid Analysis—Lyophilized tissues were hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl at 100 °C for 20–22 h, dried, and dissolved in an internal standard solution (10 μm pyridoxine and 2.40 mm homoarginine in water) and further diluted 1:4 in 0.5% heptafluorobutyric acid in 10% acetonitrile. The crosslinks were analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (23Bank R.A. Beekman B. Verzijl N. De Roos J.A. Sakkee A.N. TeKoppele J.M. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1997; 703: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The amounts of cross-links were calculated based on an internal pyridoxine standard and a cross-link standard containing pyridoxine, HP, and LP. For the amino acid analysis the samples were further diluted in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.0, and derivatized with 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (24Bank R.A. Jansen E.J. Beekman B. TeKoppele J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Excess 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate was removed by repeated pentane extraction steps and the final samples were diluted in 25% acetonitrile in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.0, and analyzed with reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using a TosoHaas TSKgel ODS-80-TM column and a Jasco fluorescent detector, with homoarginine as an internal standard. All calculations were performed with the Gynkotek M480 Chromeleon software, assuming that a triple helix contains 300 hydroxyproline residues. The values are given as number per collagen triple helix, i.e. three collagen polypeptide chains. Generation of LH1 Null Mouse Lines—The size of the murine Plod1 gene is 37 kb and it contains 19 exons. It was inactivated by homologous recombination in ES cells using a targeting construct in which the lacZ-neo reporter selection cassette was fused in-frame into exon 2 (Fig. 1A). Homologous recombination led to the deletion of exons 3–6 and fusion of the 129-bp 5′ Plod1 sequence into the bacterial β-galactosidase gene, followed by a stop codon and polyadenylation signal. The message starting from the Plod1 promoter thus encoded the β-galactosidase. Correct targeting was assessed by PCR and confirmed by Southern hybridization (Fig. 1B) and inactivation of the Plod1 gene was verified by RT-PCR using exon 10 and 12-specific primers and heart RNA as a template (Fig. 1C). The absence of any splice variant that might encode a polypeptide with partial LH activity was confirmed further by using exon 18- and 19-specific primers and the same heart RNA (details not shown). These two exons encode the two histidines, one aspartate, and one arginine that bind the iron and 2-oxoglutarate cosubstrates that are essential for enzyme activity (25Pirskanen A. Kaimio A.-M.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Heterozygous mice were generated by routine methods and back-crossed into C57BL/6. Two separate mouse lines were generated, both having the same phenotype. Cross-breeding of heterozygous mice produced all three genotypes in the Mendelian ratio (details not shown). These mouse lines were used in all other experiments except those involving X-gal staining (below). A mouse line carrying a gene trap insertion in the Plod1 gene was generated from the ES cell line LH1:RST531, produced by the research consortium BayGenomics. The gene trap construct contained the Engrailed2 intron 1 and exon 2 sequences (the splice acceptor) as a leader fused to a βgeo reporter-selection cassette, followed by a polyadenylation signal (27Skarnes W.C. Moss J.E. Hurtley S.M. Beddington R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6592-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The construct, which was integrated into the 265-bp intron 12 of the Plod1 gene, interrupted the normal splicing and caused the downstream βgeo sequences to be transcribed. As a consequence, a fusion transcript of the truncated Plod1 and βgeo was formed instead of the Plod1 message. This mouse line was used in the present study only for the experiments involving X-gal staining. Expression of LH1 as Detected by X-Gal Staining in Tissues— X-Gal staining for β-galactosidase reporter activity was weak or lacking in the Plod1-/- samples, whereas intense, specific staining was seen in samples of the LH1:RST531 gene trap mouse tissues (Fig. 2). The staining was typically observed in cells producing fibrillar collagens, intense staining seen in fibroblasts of the lungs (Fig. 2A) and the skin, for instance, where papilla of the hair follicles and arrector pili muscles also showed staining (Fig. 2B). In the heart, strong staining was seen in the auricles, the fibrous extensions of the atria (Fig. 2C), a weaker staining was observed in the heart muscle (not shown). In tendons staining was seen in the fibroblasts (Fig. 2D), while in the surrounding muscle only epimysium and some of the nuclei (not shown) were stained. In bone, strong staining was detected in the periosteum, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, the keratocytes arranged between the lamellae of collagen fibers were stained in the cornea (Fig. 2F). Hypotonia in Plod1-/- Mice—The LH1-null mice were viable and showed no kyphoscoliosis or other obvious abnormalities when observed in the cage environment, except that they appeared to be somewhat slower than their wild-type or heterozygous littermates. A distinct feature was noticed when the null mice were handled, however, in that they were passive and felt soft and floppy. Experienced persons could identify the null mice simply by lifting them gently by the tail, because even though they tried to struggle, their movements were powerless relative to those of wild-type mice. This feature became more obvious when the mice gained weight. When tested for walking on a rod or on top of the wall of a plastic container, the wild-type mice had no difficulties (Fig. 3, A and C), whereas some of the Plod1-/- mice did not move at all and others were able to proceed without problems only for a short while and tired quickly (Fig. 3, B and D). One Plod1-/- mouse was sacrificed in the animal house because of “paralysis.” According to our observations, the difficulty in locomotion was most likely due to laxity or dislocation of the joints, enhanced by general weakness of the muscles. Aortic Ruptures in Plod1-/- Mice—Although most of the null mice survived to old age, some sudden deaths were observed. A total of 17% of the Plod1-/- males (21/122) and 9% of the Plod1-/- females (8/88) died before the age of one year, most at 1–4 months of age, whereas all their wild-type littermates were alive at that time. The deaths occurred during the night, when mice are most active, without any preceding signs of illness. Autopsies revealed hemorrhages in the thoracic or abdominal cavity in almost all cases (Table 1), and further examination showed aortic dissections (Fig. 4C) and in one case rupture in the media and an accumulation of cells subjacent to the adventitia, presumably as a consequence of a previous injury (Fig. 4D). The ruptures were detected between the external elastic lamellae, whereas the elastic lamellae themselves were not fragmented (Fig. 4, C and D).TABLE 1Autopsy findings in 3-week- to 1-year-old Plod1-/- mice found dead without previous signs of illness The total numbers of Plod1-/- mice were 122 males and 88 females.Autopsy findingMalesFemalesnHemorrhage in the thoracic cavity123Hemorrhage in the abdominal cavity2Hemorrhage in the colon1Nothing obvious1Not analyzedaDiscarded in the animal house55a Discarded in the animal house Open table in a new tab No major histological alterations relative to the wild type were found in the structure or thickness of the aortic wall in the healthy Plod1-null mice (Fig. 4A), but the organization of their vascular smooth muscle cells appeared to be less regular. X-Gal staining showed that Plod1 was expressed in the cells of the tunica media and the adventitia of the aorta in the LH1:RST531 mouse line (Fig. 4B). Transmission electron microscopy revealed degenerative changes such as vacuolization and mitochondrial swelling in the smooth muscle cells of the aortic walls of the null mice without ruptures, even some completely degenerated cells being observed (Fig. 4F). Echocardiographic examination revealed no changes in the structure or function of the heart (data not shown). Abnormal Collagen Fibrils in Plod1-/- Mice—Although one of the characteristic findings in EDS is soft skin with atrophic scars and easy bruising (13Steinmann B. Royce P.M. Superti-Furga A. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular, Genetic, and Medical Aspects.

We have previously identified a novel muscle-specific actin-binding protein, STARS (striated muscle activator of Rho signaling), which directly binds actin and stimulates serum-response factor (SRF)-dependent transcription. To further dissect the STARS/SRF pathway, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a skeletal muscle cDNA library using STARS as bait, and we identified two novel members of the ABLIM protein family, ABLIM-2 and -3, as STARS-interacting proteins. ABLIM-1, which is expressed in retina, brain, and muscle tissue, has been postulated to function as a tumor suppressor. ABLIM-2 and -3 display distinct tissue-specific expression patterns with the highest expression levels in muscle and neuronal tissue. Moreover, these novel ABLIM proteins strongly bind F-actin, are localized to actin stress fibers, and synergistically enhance STARS-dependent activation of SRF. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous ABLIM expression utilizing small interfering RNA significantly blunted SRF-dependent transcription in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. These findings suggest that the members of the novel ABLIM protein family may serve as a scaffold for signaling modules of the actin cytoskeleton and thereby modulate transcription.

These findings suggest that the members of the novel ABLIM protein family may serve as a scaffold for signaling modules of the actin cytoskeleton and thereby modulate transcription. The actin cytoskeleton controls a wide range of cellular processes, particularly those that require shape changes, such as cell motility, contractility, mitosis and cytokinesis, axon outgrowth, as well as endocytosis and secretion (reviewed in Refs. 1Chen H.

Bioessays. 2003; 25: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Beyond these mechanical functions, actin has also been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of transcription and gene expression, either through its direct association with nuclear chromatin-remodeling proteins (reviewed in Ref. 3Rando O.J. Zhao K. Crabtree G.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 92-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) or indirectly through cytoplasmic changes in cytoskeletal actin dynamics (4Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The latter effects are tightly controlled by the state of actin polymerization, i.e. the equilibrium between incorporation of monomeric actin (G-actin) at the barbed end of a filament and the dissociation of actin from the pointed end of polymerized actin (F-actin). This process, referred to as “actin treadmilling,” is regulated by several signal transduction cascades that converge on actin-binding proteins such as cofilin/actin-depolymerizing factor, profilin, and β-thymosin (reviewed in Ref. 5Wear M.A. Schafer D.A. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 891-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The Rho family of GTPases, including the best characterized members Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, serve as molecular switches in the regulation of a wide variety of signal transduction pathways (6Sorokina E.M.

Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar). Rho GTPases alternate between two conformational states, the active state (bound to GTP) and the inactive state (bound to GDP). This balance is, in turn, carefully regulated by numerous activators (guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)) 5The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; ABLIM, actin-binding LIM protein; MRTF, myocardin-related transcription factor; SRF, serum-response factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; EST, expressed sequence tag; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 5The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; ABLIM, actin-binding LIM protein; MRTF, myocardin-related transcription factor; SRF, serum-response factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; EST, expressed sequence tag; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. and inactivators (GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors). Rho effector molecules include the kinase p160 ROCK and the mammalian homologue of diaphanous (mDia), both of which promote stress fiber formation (9Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RhoA signaling has been shown to stimulate the transcriptional activity of the serum response factor (SRF) via changes in actin dynamics (4Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J.

SRF, a MADS (MCM1, Agamous, Deficiens and SRF)-box containing transcription factor, regulates expression of immediate-early genes as well as muscle-specific genes (reviewed in Ref. 12Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). More recently, the mechanism whereby SRF senses increased levels of polymerized actin has been elucidated (13Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R.

Hockemeyer D. Sutherland L. Wang Z. Schratt G. Richardson J.A. Nordheim A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14855-14860Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 16Wang D.

Upon activation of RhoA, actin becomes polymerized and thus releases MRTF-A/MAL, which translocates to the nucleus to associate with SRF. We previously identified a novel muscle-specific actin-binding protein, STARS (striated muscle activator of Rho signaling), which directly binds actin and co-localizes with actin stress fibers (17Arai A. Spencer J.A. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24453-24459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). STARS stimulates SRF-dependent transcription through a mechanism that requires actin polymerization and Rho GTPase activation. In muscle cells, STARS regulates the nuclear import of the myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs) via depletion of the G-actin pool, thus establishing a mechanism of STARS-dependent SRF activation (18Kuwahara K. Barrientos T. Pipes G.C. Li S. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3173-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in cardiomyocytes STARS is localized to the sarcomere, thus providing a potential link between contractile function and signaling. In this regard, several recent reports suggest that the sarcomere indeed serves a critical role in sensing biomechanical stress and activation of downstream signaling pathways (19Pyle W.G.

Physiol. 2003; 284: C1411-C1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) but is also required for the ensuing hypertrophic response (25Hoshijima M. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Biol.

Finally, a RhoA-specific GEF, p63 Rho GEF, has been identified that is highly expressed in the heart and also localized to the sarcomere (29Souchet M. Portales-Casamar E. Mazurais D. Schmidt S. Leger I. Javre J.L. Robert P. Berrebi-Bertrand I. Bril A. Gout B. Debant A. Calmels T.P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 629-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), further supporting the hypothesis that sarcomeric Rho signaling plays an important role in striated muscle tissue. In an attempt to further dissect the Rho/STARS/SRF pathway in muscle tissue, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a skeletal muscle cDNA library using STARS as bait. From this screen we identified two novel members of the ABLIM protein family, ABLIM-2 and -3, as STARS-interacting molecules. ABLIM-1 was originally found in human retina as well as in the sarcomeres of murine cardiac tissue and was postulated to regulate actin-dependent signaling (30Roof D.J. Hayes A. Adamian M. Chishti A.H. Li T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Likewise, ABLIM-2 and -3 display distinct tissue-specific expression patterns with the highest expression levels in muscle and neuronal tissue. Moreover, these novel ABLIM proteins are localized to actin stress fibers and show a sarcomeric localization in striated muscle. We show that ABLIM-2 and -3 both strongly bind F-actin and can augment STARS-dependent SRF activation, suggesting that this new protein family serves as a scaffold for signaling modules of the actin cytoskeleton. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—An amino-terminally truncated mouse STARS cDNA (encoding amino acids 234-375) was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (plasmid Pas1; Clontech) and was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of ∼1 × 106 clones of a human skeletal muscle cDNA library (Clontech), as described (31Frey N. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13998-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, clones displaying differential growth on selective plates, lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan, were picked and replated for β-galactosidase assays. Positive clones were grown in selective medium lacking leucine, and plasmid DNA was isolated and subsequently electroporated into Escherichia coli strain DH10B (Invitrogen). The obtained clones were sequenced and retransformed with the original STARS construct to confirm the interaction. Cloning of ABLIM-2 and -3 and Bioinformatics—Partial ABLIM-2 cDNA sequences identified by yeast two-hybrid screens were used to screen the data base (GenBank™) for overlapping expressed sequence tags (EST). After bioinformatic construction of the respective open reading frames, the following primers were used to PCR-clone full-length mouse ABLIM-2 (forward, 5′-ATGAGCGCAGTGTCGCAGCC-3′, and reverse 5′-CTGTCAGAACAGCAAGGCTTTC-3′), human ABLIM-2 (forward, 5′-GACTCCGAGCGGCTGCTGAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAGGCTCGCTGGCAGCCGTC-3′), and human ABLIM-3 (forward, 5′-GCAGCCGGGGCCTCCGTATTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GAGCCTCTGCCTAGAACAGCC-3′) from human and mouse skeletal muscle, cardiac tissue, as well as brain cDNA. In addition, expression constructs were cloned for all three ABLIM proteins, encoding for an amino-terminal fusion with a FLAG tag, as described previously (31Frey N. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13998-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Human ABLIM-3 was fused with a GST domain (Pgex2T vector) as described (32Frey N. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14632-14637Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) to allow for GST pulldown experiments. Northern Blot Analysis and Radioactive in Situ Hybridization—Multiple tissue Northern blots (Clontech) containing mouse and human poly(A) RNA were hybridized overnight at 65 °C with [32P]dCTP-labeled (Rediprime II random prime labeling system; Amersham Biosciences) cDNA probes corresponding to the open reading frame of mouse and human ABLIM-2 and -3, respectively. Serial washes were conducted with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Autoradiography was performed at -80 °C for 24-48 h with an intensifying screen. For radioactive in situ hybridization, RNA probes corresponding to sense and antisense strands of ABLIM-2 and ABLIM-3 cDNAs were prepared, using T7 and T3 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and 35S-labeled UTP. Sections of mouse embryos at various time points were subjected to in situ hybridization, as described (33Lu J. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Sense probes were used as negative controls. Generation of an ABLIM-2-specific Antiserum and Western Blot Analysis—A peptide consisting of 15 amino-terminal amino acids (NH2-SQPQAAHAPLEKPAS-OH) of mouse ABLIM-2 was synthesized (Biosynthesis) and used to generate antisera in rabbits. The amino terminus was chosen to generate an isoform-specific antiserum, because this part of the protein does not display significant homology to the other two ABLIM family members (supplemental Fig. 1). Similarly, 14 amino-terminal amino acids of mouse ABLIM-3 (NH2-PYQQSPYSPRGGSN-OH) were utilized to generate an ABLIM-3 antiserum. IgG was purified from rabbit serum using protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and subsequently used for Western blotting as well as immunostaining of mouse skeletal muscle cryosections. Immunostaining—The subcellular localization of ABLIM-2 was determined in cryosections of mouse hindlimb skeletal muscle tissue using indirect immunofluorescence. Cryosections were air-dried and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, followed by three washes with PBS, permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and blocking in 3% horse serum for 1 h. Primary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at the following dilutions: polyclonal anti-ABLIM-2 1:100, polyclonal anti-STARS 1:50, and monoclonal anti-sarcomeric actinin (Sigma) 1:200. Secondary antibodies conjugated to either fluorescein or TRITC (Vector Laboratories) were also incubated for 1 h at a dilution of 1:250. Transfected C2C12 cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized, and blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma), 1:200; anti-ABLIM-2 polyclonal antibody, 1:75) in 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h. Secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein or TRITC (Vector Laboratories) were used at 1:200. Vectashield medium with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) was used for mounting. Tissue Culture, Immunoprecipitations, and Reporter Gene Assays—293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. 2 × 105 cells were transfected with 1 μg of expression plasmids for full-length ABLIM-1, -2, and -3 as well as a Myc-tagged STARS construct (17Arai A. Spencer J.A. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24453-24459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested in RIPA buffer, containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 15 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% SDS, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science). Cells were briefly sonicated, and debris was removed by centrifugation. Tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated for 2-3 h at 4 °C using protein A/G-agarose and 1 μg of the appropriate antibody (monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma) and polyclonal anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)). Subsequently, the pellet was washed with ELB buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene membranes and immunoblotting using anti-FLAG and anti-Myc antibodies, as indicated. COS-7 cells as well as C2C12 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding Myc-STARS, FLAG-ABLIM-2 or FLAG-ABLIM-3, and an SM22 promoter-luciferase construct as well as a β-galactosidase construct to normalize for efficiency of transfection, using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). All experiments were conducted in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Luciferase assays from COS cell lysates were performed using a kit, as suggested by the manufacturer (Promega). RNA Interference and Real Time PCR—C2C12 myoblasts were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To verify efficiency of siRNA-mediated knockdown of the ABLIMs 1-3, RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA per sample was carried out using the Superscript III first strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR and random primers (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed in an ABI 7700 thermocycler applying the Platinum® SYBR® Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen). Resulting data were normalized to 18 S rRNA. The siRNAs used were as follows: ABLIM-1, sense 5′-CCAAGCAUUUCCACAUCAA-3′ and antisense 5′-UUGAUGUGGAAAUGCUUGG-3′ (Eurogentec, Belgium). The siRNAs for ABLIM-2 and -3 were obtained from Dharmacon (ONTARGET plus; catalogue numbers 058308 (ABLIM-2) and 041985 (ABLIM-3)). Negative control siRNA duplexes (OR-0030-NEG05) were purchased from Eurogentec. Primers for real time PCR analyses were designed using the primer3 software. All amplicons spanned at least one intron-exon-intron boundary to prevent amplification of contaminating genomic DNA as follows: 18 S rRNA forward 5′-TCAAGAACGAAAGTCGGAGG-3′ and 18 S rRNA reverse 5′-GGACATCTAAGGGCATCAC-3′; ABLIM-1 forward 5′-TGGTTCACCAGGCCATACTA-3′ and ABLIM-1 reverse 5′-CTTCTGCAGATGGAGTTGGA-3′; ABLIM-2 forward 5′-CAGCCAGGACTGAAGACAAA-3′ and ABLIM-2 reverse 5′-AGCAGCCAAGTCCCTGTAGT-3′; and ABLIM-3 forward 5′-TCTGGAGGAGAGGAAGAGGA-3′ and ABLIM-3 reverse 5′-CAGTGAGGCAGATTTGGAGA-3′. GST Pulldown Assays—For GST pulldown experiments, 10 μl of in vitro translated ABLIM-3 was mixed with 500 μl of binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) and added to agarose-GST or agarose-GST-STARS. The mixture was incubated with rotation for 1 h at 4 °C followed by four washes with cold binding buffer. After the washes, 25 μl of protein loading dye was added to the pulldown reaction. The proteins were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min and run on a 10% Tris-acrylamide gel. Actin Co-sedimentation Assay—Full-length cDNA clones of FLAG-ABLIM-2 and -3 were expressed in vitro using the TnT ® T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Equal expression levels were confirmed by Western blotting. Purified actin, α-actinin, and BSA were purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. Actin co-sedimentation assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and Ponceau S staining. Western blots were performed with the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (1 μg/ml; Sigma) and the monoclonal anti-α-actinin antibody (1:1000; Sigma), respectively. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen with STARS and Molecular Cloning of ABLIM-2 and ABLIM-3—To identify novel STARS-interacting proteins in striated muscle tissue, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human skeletal muscle cDNA library using the evolutionarily conserved carboxyl terminus of STARS (amino acids 234-375) as bait. This region of STARS has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for actin binding and for stimulation of SRF-dependent transcription (17Arai A. Spencer J.A. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24453-24459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). From this screen, we identified three β-galactosidase-positive clones encoding for skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1), confirming our previous findings that STARS is an actin-binding protein (17Arai A. Spencer J.A. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24453-24459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Two additional independent clones encoded a novel open reading frame. Data bank comparisons revealed partial identity of these clones with a previously uncharacterized protein fragment, KIAA1808 (GenBank™ accession number BAB47437). To obtain a full-length clone, we designed primers, using the longest human EST sequences available in the data base, and subsequently cloned the entire open reading frame (supplemental Fig. 1), encoding 649 amino acids (GenBank™ accession number DQ413176). We also identified a shorter splice variant encoding 559 amino acids (Fig. 1C and see supplemental Fig. 1) (GenBank™ accession number DQ413177), as well as the mouse homologue (GenBank™ accession number DQ413175), which displays high homology to the human protein (Fig. 1A). These novel proteins contain four LIM domains as well as a carboxyl-terminal villin domain (Fig. 1A). Further querying of the data base revealed high homology with the actin-binding LIM protein (ABLIM), which had originally been found in human retina (30Roof D.J. Hayes A. Adamian M. Chishti A.H. Li T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, the data base contained a sequence for another previously uncharacterized putative protein fragment with homology to both ABLIM and KIAA1808 and KIAA0843 (GenBank™ accession number BAA74866). Utilizing the EST data base, we designed primers for the human homologue of this putative novel protein and subcloned the open reading frame from human heart cDNA (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1) (GenBank™ accession number DQ413174). The identical domain architecture (Fig. 1B), as well as the high homology between these three proteins, suggests that they constitute a novel protein family, and we thus designated the newly identified members ABLIM-2 and ABLIM-3 (Fig. 1). Interestingly, ABLIM proteins are evolutionary conserved with (single) homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans (UNC-115) and Drosophila (D-UNC-115) (Fig. 1, A and B). ABLIM-2 and -3 Are Expressed in a Tissue-specific Pattern—Because STARS is expressed in a highly striated muscle-specific fashion, we examined if ABLIM-2 and -3 might display a similar expression pattern. An adult human multiple tissue Northern blot revealed that ABLIM-2 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle (Fig. 2A, left panel) and at lower levels in brain, spleen, and kidney. In heart and skeletal muscle, at least two distinct bands could be observed, consistent with the existence of splice variants. No significant expression was detected in the heart. Because we identified two possible splice variants of human ABLIM-2 (Fig. 1C), we examined the tissue distribution of the longer splice variant (hABLIMv1), using a probe specific for the 270 nucleotides unique to this isoform. However, we observed the same expression pattern as shown in Fig. 2A (data not shown). In contrast to ABLIM-2, ABLIM-3 is predominantly expressed in human heart and brain, whereas the murine ABLIM-3 homologue displays a somewhat broader tissue distribution that also includes lung and liver. Temporospatial Expression Patterns of ABLIM-2/-3—To analyze the temporospatial expression patterns of ABLIM-2 and ABLIM-3, we performed radioactive in situ hybridization experiments (Fig. 2B). At embryonic day (E) 15.5 of mouse development, ABLIM-2 is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle tissue, including the diaphragm, and to a lesser extent, in the central nervous system. At the same time point, ABLIM-3 also displays strong expression in skeletal muscle. These findings demonstrate a developmental regulation of ABLIM gene expression, especially of the expression of ABLIM-3, which is highly expressed during embryonic development (Fig. 2B) but down-regulated in adult skeletal muscle (Fig. 2A). ABLIM-2 and-3 Are Expressed in Distinct Regions of the Brain—Given that ABLIM-2 and -3 are both expressed in brain, we sought to further define their expression profiles in central nervous tissue and thus conducted analyses of adult mouse brain sections. Interestingly, these experiments revealed very distinct and nonoverlapping patterns for ABLIM-2 and -3 (Fig. 3, top and bottom). In contrast to ABLIM-3 (panel B2), ABLIM-2 is highly expressed in caudate/putamen (panel A2). Conversely, the olfactory bulb stains strongly for ABLIM-3 (panel B3), whereas ABLIM-2 is only moderately expressed (panel A3). Both genes are expressed in the hippocampus, whereas ABLIM-2 is detected in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 fields of the hippocampus (Fig. 3, panel A4), and ABLIM-3 is found selectively in the CA2 and CA3 fields (panel B4). In cerebellum, Purkinje cells are positive for ABLIM-2 (Fig. 3, panel A5), whereas internal granular cells are selectively positive for ABLIM-3 (panel B5). Protein Expression and Subcellular Localization of ABLIM-2—To analyze the expression pattern of the ABLIM-2 protein, we generated antisera against a synthetic peptide specific for mouse ABLIM-2. Western blots (Fig. 4A) confirmed the expression of ABLIM-2 in skeletal muscle and brain. Interestingly, at least two distinct bands could be detected, suggesting either different splice products of the ablim-2 gene or tissue-specific differential post-translational modifications of the protein. We also generated an antiserum against ABLIM-3 that detects the protein when overexpressed in COS cells (data not shown). However, this antiserum displays a high background when used in tissue preparations and was not useful for further analyses. Staining of mouse skeletal muscle hindlimb cryosections with the anti-ABLIM-2 antibody (Fig. 4B, upper panels) revealed a striated pattern, consistent with a sarcomeric or costameric localization of the protein. Similarly, staining of skeletal muscle cryosections with a polyclonal anti-STARS antibody (17Arai A. Spencer J.A. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24453-24459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) revealed the same pattern (Fig. 4B, lower panels), suggesting that ABLIM proteins and STARS co-localize in vivo. ABLIM-2 and -3 Bind F-actin—Both ABLIM-2 and -3 contain a “villin domain” (also called villin headpiece domain) composed of 74 amino acids at their carboxyl termini. This domain is highly conserved among the thr"
https://openalex.org/W2127990678,"Both nitric oxide (NO*) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) protect the endothelium and regulate its function. Here, we tested for crosstalk between these signaling pathways. Human umbilical vein and hybrid EA.hy926 endothelial cells were exposed to S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) or diethylenetriamine NONOate (DETA NONOate). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using PPAR-response element (PPRE) probe showed that NO* caused a rapid dose-dependent increase in PPARgamma binding, an effect that was confirmed in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Conversely, N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine, a NOS inhibitor, decreased PPARgamma binding. NO*-mediated PPARgamma binding and NO* induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase alpha (DGKalpha), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), genes with well-characterized PPRE motifs, were cGMP independent. NO* dose dependently activated p38 MAPK, and p38 MAPK inhibition with SB202190 or knockdown with siRNA was shown to block NO* activation of PPARgamma. Likewise, p38 MAPK and PPARgamma inhibitors or knockdown of either transcript all significantly blocked NO* induction of PPRE-regulated genes. PPARgamma activation by p38 MAPK may contribute to the anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects of NO* in the vasculature. This crosstalk mechanism suggests new strategies for preventing and treating vascular dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2109932915,"Dapper1 and Dapper2, two divergent members of the Dapper family, have been suggested to modulate Wnt and TGF-beta/Nodal signaling in Xenopus and zebrafish. To get a better understanding of Dapper function in mammals, we have cloned the mouse ortholog of zebrafish Dapper2, mDpr2 and investigated its function in regulating TGF-beta signaling activity. Here, we showed that, like zebrafish Dapper2, overexpression of mDpr2 inhibited the TGF-beta-induced expression of the Smad-responsive reporters and targeted TGF-beta type I receptor ALK5 for degradation in mammalian cells. Overexpression of mDpr2 in the zebrafish embryos led to a decrease in expression of the mesoderm marker no tail and goosecoid at the shield stage and eye fusion later, implying that mDpr2 may have an intrinsic in vivo activity similar to fish Dapper2 activity. The expression of mDpr2 was detected throughout the epiblast around the onset of gastrulation and in somites, the neural tube and gut at later stages in mouse embryos, implying a role in early embryonic development. Our data indicate that the function of Dpr2 as a negative regulator of the TGF-beta/Nodal signal pathway is evolutionally conserved, at least in part, in fish and mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2162624621,"Signal transduction through heterotrimeric G proteins is critical for sensory response across species. Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are negative regulators of signal transduction. Herein we describe a role for C. elegans RGS-3 in the regulation of sensory behaviors. rgs-3 mutant animals fail to respond to intense sensory stimuli but respond normally to low concentrations of specific odorants. We find that loss of RGS-3 leads to aberrantly increased G protein-coupled calcium signaling but decreased synaptic output, ultimately leading to behavioral defects. Thus, rgs-3 responses are restored by decreasing G protein-coupled signal transduction, either genetically or by exogenous dopamine, by expressing a calcium-binding protein to buffer calcium levels in sensory neurons or by enhancing glutamatergic synaptic transmission from sensory neurons. Therefore, while RGS proteins generally act to downregulate signaling, loss of a specific RGS protein in sensory neurons can lead to defective responses to external stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2058709834,"Signal transduction in rod cells begins with photon absorption by rhodopsin and leads to the generation of an electrical response. The response profile is determined by the molecular properties of the phototransduction components. To examine how the molecular properties of rhodopsin correlate with the rod-response profile, we have generated a knock-in mouse with rhodopsin replaced by its E122Q mutant, which exhibits properties different from those of wild-type (WT) rhodopsin. Knock-in mouse rods with E122Q rhodopsin exhibited a photosensitivity about 70% of WT. Correspondingly, their single-photon response had an amplitude about 80% of WT, and a rate of decline from peak about 1.3 times of WT. The overall 30% lower photosensitivity of mutant rods can be explained by a lower pigment photosensitivity (0.9) and the smaller single-photon response (0.8). The slower decline of the response, however, did not correlate with the 10-fold shorter lifetime of the meta-II state of E122Q rhodopsin. This shorter lifetime became evident in the recovery phase of rod cells only when arrestin was absent. Simulation analysis of the photoresponse profile indicated that the slower decline and the smaller amplitude of the single-photon response can both be explained by the shift in the meta-I/meta-II equilibrium of E122Q rhodopsin toward meta-I. The difference in meta-III lifetime between WT and E122Q mutant became obvious in the recovery phase of the dark current after moderate photobleaching of rod cells. Thus, the present study clearly reveals how the molecular properties of rhodopsin affect the amplitude, shape, and kinetics of the rod response.

Thus, the present study clearly reveals how the molecular properties of rhodopsin affect the amplitude, shape, and kinetics of the rod response. Light absorption by rhodopsin in rod photoreceptor cells results in the activation of a G protein-mediated signal transduction cascade that eventually generates an electrical response (1Yau K.W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 9-32PubMed Google Scholar). The key proteins in this cascade have been identified, and their molecular properties as well as interactions with each other have been extensively investigated (2Helmreich E.J. Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 3Shichida Y. Imai H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1299-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A current question is how well these properties and interactions correlate with the response profile of the photoreceptor cells. Although the gene knock-out approach has been very useful in addressing this question for the proteins rhodopsin kinase and arrestin (4Xu J. Dodd R.L. Makino C.L. Simon M.I. Baylor D.A. Chen J. Nature. 1997; 389: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 5Chen C.K. Burns M.E. Spencer M. Niemi G.A. Chen J. Hurley J.B. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3718-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), this strategy is less appropriate for rhodopsin and G protein, because the deletions of these proteins eliminated the light response (6Lem J. Krasnoperova N.V. Calvert P.D. Kosaras B. Cameron D.A. Nicolo M. Makino C.L. Sidman R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 7Calvert P.D.

The gene knock-in approach is an alternative way, with a mutant protein replacing the wild-type (WT) 8The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; ROS, rod outer segment.8The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; ROS, rod outer segment. version. The maintenance of the same expression level of the protein in this procedure is important, because the interpretation can be difficult otherwise. For example, the photoresponse profile is altered when the rhodopsin content in rods is halved (8Calvert P.D. Govardovskii V.I. Krasnoperova N. Anderson R.E. Lem J. Makino C.L. Nature. 2001; 411: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 9Liang Y. Fotiadis D. Maeda T. Maeda A. Modzelewska A. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

Yoshizawa T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9040-9044Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) has shown that their photosensitivities are not so different, but the meta-II (the G protein-activating state), as well as the subsequent meta-III, intermediates of cone pigments exhibit faster decay than those of rhodopsin. In addition, the equilibrium between meta-II and its precursor, meta-I, is different between rhodopsin and cone pigments (11Imai H. Kuwayama S. Onishi A. Morizumi T. Chisaka O. Shichida Y. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2005; 4: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Finally, we have found that the amino acid residues at positions 122 and 189 underlie these differences in molecular properties (12Imai H. Kojima D. Oura T. Tachibanaki S. Terakita A. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2322-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Kuwayama S. Imai H. Hirano T. Terakita A. Shichida Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15245-15252Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, to obtain insight into how the molecular properties of rhodopsin correlate with the photoresponse profile of rod cells, and to elucidate the differences in response properties between rods and cones, we have generated a knock-in mouse line in which E122Q rhodopsin replaced WT rhodopsin in the rod cells. Mutation of the Glu122 residue in chicken rhodopsin into the corresponding residue in cone pigments results in a faster decay of meta-II, a shift of the meta-I/meta-II equilibrium toward meta-I (12Imai H. Kojima D. Oura T. Tachibanaki S. Terakita A. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2322-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Nathans J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and a faster regeneration of the pigment (15Imai H. Terakita A. Tachibanaki S. Imamoto Y. Yoshizawa T. Shichida Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12773-12779Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, this point mutant recapitulates certain cone-pigment-like properties in rhodopsin. Residue 122 is located near the β-ionone ring of the chromophore in the helical core of the visual pigment (16Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar), and its substitution has little effect on the interaction of the pigment with other proteins, such as G protein. More importantly, the replacement of only one codon in the native rhodopsin gene without disturbing the exon-intron arrangement should give similar transcription and translation as WT. This knock-in mouse allows us to compare the molecular properties of WT and E122Q rhodopsin in the same native environment, i.e. membranes of the rod outer segment (ROS). Our findings reported here clearly show that several of the rhodopsin molecular properties, such as absorption spectrum, photosensitivity, shift in the meta-I/meta-II equilibrium, and meta-III decay, do correlate well with the rodresponse profile and the recovery of rod sensitivity after a bleaching light. The meta-II decay also correlates well with the decline phase of the rod response when arrestin is absent. Generation of Rhodopsin-mutant Mouse—Mutant mice with E122Q rhodopsin were generated as previously reported (17Chisaka O. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 18Onishi A. Hasegawa J. Imai H. Chisaka O. Ueda Y. Honda Y. Tachibana M. Shichida Y. Zoolog Sci. 2005; 22: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mouse rhodopsin genomic clones were modified by replacing Glu122 (GAA) with Gln (GAG) in the second exon and introducing the positive selection marker (PGKneopA) into the first intron in the reverse direction (Fig. 1A). The E122Q-positive ES cells were screened from electroporated R1 ES cells derived from the 129/Sv x 129Sv-CP mouse line, and chimeric mice were generated by injecting them into C57BL/6J blastocysts, which were subsequently implanted into the uteri of pseudo-pregnant foster females. The chimeras were mated with C57BL/6J mice to generate heterozygous mice that were then inbred to generate homozygous mice. The targeted allele has been maintained in both 129/SvJ and C57BL/6J backgrounds according to the guidelines for animal experiments at Kyoto University. Estimation of Protein Expression Level—Protein expression levels were estimated by spectroscopy and Western blotting. Retinas were isolated from mouse eyes, homogenized, and extracted by buffer A (1% dodecylmaltoside, 50 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5) for spectroscopy or by SDS-PAGE sample buffer (8% SDS, 0.125 m Tris/Cl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 5% mercaptoethanol) for Western blotting. The concentration of pigment in the extract solubilized by buffer A was estimated from the maximum absorbance in the difference spectrum before and after irradiation with >480 nm light in the presence of 100 mm hydroxylamine. For calculations, we used molar extinction coefficients of both rhodopsin and E122Q rhodopsin. Molar extinction coefficients of rhodopsin and E122Q rhodopsin at their absorption maxima (502 and 487 nm, respectively) are 40,200 ± 2,100 and 44,800 ± 2,200 m-1 cm-1, respectively, 9H. Imai, unpublished results. which were estimated using a method previously described (19Okano T. Fukada Y. Shichida Y. Yoshizawa T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the acid-denaturing method (20Sakamoto T. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These values are in good agreement with those estimated previously for bovine rhodopsin (21Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 22Nakayama T.A. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4269-4275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression levels for WT and E122Q rhodopsins, transducin, and rhodopsin kinase were also estimated by Western blotting with antibodies against rhodopsin (1D4), transducin (23Suzuki T. Narita K. Yoshihara K. Nagai K. Kito Y. Zoolog. Sci. 1993; 10: 425-430PubMed Google Scholar), and rhodopsin kinase (sc-561, Santa Cruz). Histology—Eyes were removed and fixed for 4 h at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. After cryoprotection in cold 30% sucrose, the tissue was mounted with Tissue-Tek OCT and sectioned at 10-μm thickness along the vertical meridian passing through the optic nerve. Staining was with 1% toluidine blue O. Spectroscopy of Pigments in Native ROS Membranes—ROS membranes were isolated by a conventional sucrose flotation method (24Shichida Y. Ono T. Yoshizawa T. Matsumoto H. Asato A.E. Zingoni J.P. Liu R.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4422-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) from retinas of mice dark-adapted for 12 h. The membrane fractions were suspended in buffer B (112.5 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 2.4 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) and sonicated. Absorption spectroscopy was performed as previously reported on a Shimadzu MPS-2000 or UV-2400 spectrophotometer (25Shichida Y. Tachibanaki S. Mizukami T. Imai H. Terakita A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 347-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a specially constructed CCD spectrophotometer (26Morizumi T. Imai H. Shichida Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9936-9943Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The sample temperature was regulated by thermostat to within 0.1 °C in the cell holder of the spectrophotometer. Light sources for sample irradiation were a 1-kW tungsten halogen lamp (Rikagaku Seiki) and a short arc power flash (Nissin Electronic Co., pulse duration = 350 μs), which were attached in the Shimadzu spectrophotometer and the CCD spectrophotometer, respectively. A glass cut-off (VY50, VY52, or VY54; Toshiba) or an interference (500 nm; Nihon Shinku) filter was used for selection of the irradiation wavelengths. Details of procedures for specific measurements including irradiation conditions are described in the figure legends. Single-cell Recordings—WT and homozygous E122Q mice were housed in a 12/12-h light-dark cycle. Mice lacking arrestin (Arr-/-) (4Xu J. Dodd R.L. Makino C.L. Simon M.I. Baylor D.A. Chen J. Nature. 1997; 389: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), including E122Q, Arr-/- mice, were reared in constant darkness. Animals raised in a light-dark cycle were dark-adapted overnight before the experiment. Tissue preparation and recording techniques followed procedures described elsewhere (27Burns M.E. Mendez A. Chen J. Baylor D.A. Neuron. 2002; 36: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, an animal was euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation/cervical dislocation and the eyes were removed under dim red light. All further manipulations were performed under infrared light. The retinas removed from the eyes were chopped into small pieces with a razor blade. Small pieces of the retina were placed in the experimental chamber on the stage of an inverted microscope and perfused with bicarbonate-buffered solution (112.5 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 2.4 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm NaHCO3, 3 mm sodium succinate, 0.5 mm sodium glutamate, 0.02 mm EDTA, and 10 mm glucose). The solution was bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2, and warmed to 36-38 °C in a flow heater (28Matthews H.R. J. Physiol. 1999; 518P: 13PGoogle Scholar) before it entered the experimental chamber. Membrane current was recorded with a suction electrode from an ROS projecting from a piece of retina. The recording electrode was filled with 140 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 2.4 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 3 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.02 mm EDTA, and 10 mm glucose. 20-ms flashes were delivered from a calibrated light source via computer-controlled shutters. Light intensity and wavelength were changed by using calibrated neutral density and interference filters. The current was amplified, low-pass filtered at 30 Hz, digitized at 1 kHz, and stored on a computer for subsequent analysis. Simulation of Rod Photoresponses—The rod-response profile was simulated by the model described previously (29Ichikawa K. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 19: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) with some modifications. First, the reaction scheme was modified so that transducin can bind to phosphodiesterase at the mole ratio of 1:1. Second, parameters such as rod outer segment morphology (30Carter-Dawson L.D. LaVail M.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1979; 188: 245-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and phosphodiesterase deactivation rate constant (31Makino C.L. Dodd R.L. Chen J. Burns M.E. Roca A. Simon M.I. Baylor D.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) appropriate for mouse rods were substituted for those for amphibian rods used in the previous model. The reaction model was constructed with the A-cell 5.1 software (32Ichikawa K. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 483-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Ichikawa K. Neuroinformatics. 2005; 3: 49-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of E122Q Knock-in Mice—WT rhodopsin was replaced by its E122Q mutant in mouse by using gene targeting (Fig. 1, A and B). The homozygous animals were viable and fertile. The expression level of E122Q rhodopsin in these animals was indistinguishable from that of WT rhodopsin (Fig. 1C), and the levels of transducin, rhodopsin kinase, and green-sensitive cone opsin were also indistinguishable (data not shown). The homozygous animals with the positive selection marker (PGKneopA) still in the genome had an expression level of visual pigment about 72% of that of WT animals (Fig. 1C) but their overall retinal structure, especially that of ROS, appeared to be normal under light microscopy (Fig. 1D). The numbers of photoreceptor nuclei in WT and mutant mice were almost identical. That is, rows of photoreceptor nuclei in WT and mutant mice were 10.8 ± 1.1 and 10.2 ± 0.9, respectively, at 10 weeks of age (n = 20 from 3 animals for each genotype). The lengths of outer segment were also indistinguishable between WT (18 ± 0.8 μm) and E122Q mutants (19 ± 1.6 μm). Molecular Properties of WT and E122Q Rhodopsins—We first asked whether the E122Q mutant rhodopsin in mouse ROS exhibited molecular properties different from those of WT, as might be expected from our previous heterologous expression experiments with the same mutation in chicken rhodopsin (12Imai H. Kojima D. Oura T. Tachibanaki S. Terakita A. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2322-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The results are summarized in Fig. 2 and Table 1. The absorption maximum of E122Q rhodopsin extracted from ROS with buffer A was about 15 nm blue-shifted from that of the corresponding WT rhodopsin (Fig. 2A), similar to the findings with bovine (14Nathans J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. 2005; 4: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) E122Q rhodopsins expressed in culture cells. The photosensitivity of E122Q rhodopsin at 500 nm was 0.92 ± 0.01 of WT (Fig. 2B, Table 1). Whereas the molecular extinction coefficient at λmax was higher for E122Q rhodopsin compared with WT rhodopsin, at 500 nm the two pigments had very similar extinction coefficients (Fig. 2A and see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, the smaller photosensitivity of E122Q rhodopsin at 500 nm indicates that E122Q rhodopsin had a quantum yield lower than that of WT rhodopsin. We next investigated the thermal equilibrium between meta-I and meta-II after irradiating WT and E122Q rhodopsins in ROS membranes. We found that the equilibrium was significantly shifted toward meta-I in E122Q rhodopsin compared with WT (Fig. 2, C and D). Under the conditions described in the legends of Fig. 2, C and D, the ratio of meta-I to meta-II in E122Q rhodopsin was 34:66, while that in WT was 18:82. These values were estimated by fitting the respective spectrum obtained at 100 ms after 500 nm irradiation of each pigment with a linear combination of the spectra for meta-I and meta-II obtained independently (26Morizumi T. Imai H. Shichida Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9936-9943Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Within a few seconds after irradiation, E122Q meta-II decayed with a time constant about 10 times faster than that of WT meta-II (Fig. 2, E and F). The decay of E122Q meta-III was also 2.4-fold as fast as WT meta-III (Fig. 2, G and H, see also Fig. 5C).TABLE 1Parameters for the molecular properties of mouse rhodopsinWild typeE122Qλmax (nm)aProteins were detergent-extracted from dark-adapted eyes and measured at 2 °C.502 ± 1.3 (7)487 ± 1.4 (7)Rel. photosensitivity at 500 nmaProteins were detergent-extracted from dark-adapted eyes and measured at 2 °C.1.00.92 ± 0.01 (5)Meta-II decay time constants (s)bProteins remained in ROS membranes that were suspended in buffer B (pH 7.4) at 37 °C.95 ± 15 (7)7.7 ± 3.5 (8)Meta-III decay time constants (min)bProteins remained in ROS membranes that were suspended in buffer B (pH 7.4) at 37 °C.17.7 ± 3.0 (3)7.4 ± 3.7 (3)Regeneration time constants177 ± 32 (3)47 ± 10 (3)From opsin + 11-cis-retinal (s)cProteins remained in ROS membranes that were suspended in buffer B (pH 7.4) at 2 °C.a Proteins were detergent-extracted from dark-adapted eyes and measured at 2 °C.b Proteins remained in ROS membranes that were suspended in buffer B (pH 7.4) at 37 °C.c Proteins remained in ROS membranes that were suspended in buffer B (pH 7.4) at 2 °C.

The maximum flash response amplitudes of WT and E122Q rods were similar. The action spectra of WT and E122Q rods (Fig. 3C) were best fit by modified A1 visual-pigment templates (36Govardovskii V.I. Calvert P.D. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 791-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with λmax = 496 ± 3 nm (n = 10) for WT and 480 ± 3 nm (n = 6) for E122Q rods, in good agreement with the absorption maxima of the corresponding rhodopsins described earlier (Fig. 2A). At 500 nm, the flash sensitivity, defined as the reciprocal of half-maximal flash strength (1/I0), was lower for E122Q rods, being 0.72 that of WT (Table 2). To derive the single-photon response amplitude, we stimulated a cell with a series of 30-100 identical dim flashes. According to Poisson statistics, the amplitude of the single-photon response can be estimated from the ensemble variance to mean ratio of the response amplitude. The single-photon response amplitude (SØ) derived in this way was 0.45 ± 0.03 pA (n = 26) for mutant rods versus 0.56 ± 0.04 pA (n = 16) for WT rods (Fig. 3D and Table 2). The rate of activation of the single-photon response of the E122Q mutant rod is slightly smaller than that of WT. The decline phase of the dimflash response was notably slower in mutant rods, as reflected by the longer integration time (Fig. 3D and Table 2). These results would be due to the altered molecular properties of rhodopsin by the mutation of E122Q. Thus we tried to simulate the rod response by altering the molecular properties of rhodopsin.TABLE 2Parameters for the single-cell response of mouse rodsWild typeE122QIdaId, dark current.

Open table in a new tab Simulation of Photoresponse by Chemical Reaction Model—Can we explain the differences in response characteristics between WT and E122Q rods by the differences between WT and E122Q rhodopsins? E122Q rods exhibited a flash sensitivity at 500 nm about 0.7 times that of WT. This difference can be accounted for by the combined difference in pigment sensitivity at 500 nm (0.9) and difference in the magnitude of the singlephoton response (0.8) (0.9 × 0.8 = 0.72). Interestingly, because the size of the single-photon response in E122Q mutant was about 0.8 times that of wild-type, whereas the integration time recorded in E122Q mutant was longer (about 1.3 times), the total area under the response (amplitude × time) was quite similar in both cases. Simulation analysis based on a model previously described (29Ichikawa K. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 19: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) clearly showed that these differences in the single-photon response between E122Q and WT rods could be accounted for by a change in the meta-I/meta-II equilibrium. In addition, the shift in the meta-I to meta-II equilibrium used in our simulation correctly predicted the small difference in the rates of activation of the single photon response between WT and E122Q rods (Fig. 3D). The simulation was able to reproduce these observed differences in amplitude and kinetics when meta-II was assumed to be the only intermediate that can be phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase (Fig. 4, main panel at bottom), but not when only meta-I is phosphorylated or when both meta-I and II can be phosphorylated (Fig. 4, insets A and B at bottom). Indeed, it can be seen that the time to peak and the response recovery are delayed in the E122Q mutant when only meta-II is phosphorylated. Otherwise, they are unchanged when both intermediates are phosphorylated, a"
https://openalex.org/W2079294361,"We previously found that a mutation at the ODA7 locus in Chlamydomonas prevents axonemal outer row dynein assembly by blocking association of heavy chains and intermediate chains in the cytoplasm. We have now cloned the ODA7 locus by walking in the Chlamydomonas genome from nearby molecular markers, confirmed the identity of the gene by rescuing the mutant phenotype with genomic clones, and identified the ODA7 gene product as a 58-kDa leucine-rich repeat protein unrelated to outer row dynein LC1. Oda7p is missing from oda7 mutant flagella but is present in flagella of other outer row or inner row dynein assembly mutants. However, Oda7 levels are greatly reduced in flagella that lack both outer row dynein and inner row I1 dynein. Biochemical fractionation and rebinding studies support a model in which Oda7 participates in a previously uncharacterized structural link between inner and outer row dyneins. We previously found that a mutation at the ODA7 locus in Chlamydomonas prevents axonemal outer row dynein assembly by blocking association of heavy chains and intermediate chains in the cytoplasm. We have now cloned the ODA7 locus by walking in the Chlamydomonas genome from nearby molecular markers, confirmed the identity of the gene by rescuing the mutant phenotype with genomic clones, and identified the ODA7 gene product as a 58-kDa leucine-rich repeat protein unrelated to outer row dynein LC1.

Biochemical fractionation and rebinding studies support a model in which Oda7 participates in a previously uncharacterized structural link between inner and outer row dyneins. Bend propagation in eukaryotic cilia and flagella requires coordination among multiple dynein motors. These organelles typically have ten or more unique dynein isoforms whose properties combine to support a range of motile activities. The loss of different dynein isoforms has been correlated with reductions in beat frequency (1Mitchell D.R. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1228-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), altered waveform regulation (2Brokaw C.J. Kamiya R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1987; 8: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), loss of resistance to viscous load (3Yagi T. Minoura I. Fujiwara A. Saito R. Yasunaga T. Hirono M. Kamiya R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41412-41420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), or reduced responsiveness to tactic signals (4King S.J. Dutcher S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Although most of our current understanding of the functional contribution of dynein diversity results from mutant analysis in the green alga Chlamydomonas, similar results are seen in the ciliate Tetrahymena (5Liu S. Hard R. Rankin S. Hennessey T. Pennock D.G. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 59: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the excavate Trypanosoma (6Kohl L. Bastin P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2005; 244: 227-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and in chemically treated sea urchin spermatozoa (7Gibbons B.H. Gibbons I.R. J. Cell Sci. 1973; 13: 337-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons also support the evolution of axonemal dyneins into multiple isoforms prior to divergence of all present day organisms from the last common eukaryotic ancestor (8Asai D.J. Wilkes D.E. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Asai D.J. Koonce M.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), suggesting that dynein functional diversity plays a fundamental role in flagellar motility. Flagellar dyneins fall into two broad groups: outer row dyneins, which are essential for maintaining normal beat frequency and for some calcium-dependent waveform changes, and inner row dyneins, which are needed for normal waveform and for some tactic responses (10Kamiya R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 219: 115-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These two groups of motors also differ in their distribution along the doublet surface (11Porter M.E. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: F37-F42Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The outer row consists of a single complex that repeats every three tubulin dimers (24 nm) along each doublet, whereas several different inner row dyneins each appear only once in every twelve tubulin dimers (96 nm). This 96-nm unit appears to correspond to one regulatory interval, as it contains one dynein regulatory complex and one set of radial spokes. Although dyneins in these two groups must be coordinately regulated, links between inner and outer row dyneins have not been identified. Mutations that disrupt assembly of outer row dyneins in Chlamydomonas map to over 16 loci, most of which encode subunits in one of three complexes. The largest complex is the dynein motor itself, composed of three catalytic heavy chains, two intermediate chains, and at least nine light chains (12DiBella L.M. Sakato M. Patel-King R.S. Pazour G.J. King S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4633-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mutations in most motor subunits interfere with association of the remaining subunits into a complex in the cytoplasm and block subsequent attachment of this motor complex to flagellar doublet microtubules (13Fowkes M.E. Mitchell D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2337-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The docking complex consists of three proteins that assemble on the doublet surface separately from the motor complex (14Takada S. Wilkerson C.G. Wakabayashi K. Kamiya R. Witman G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1015-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This complex is essential for attachment of the motor complex to doublet microtubules but not for its assembly in the cytoplasm. The Oda5 protein may form part of a third complex that associates with outer row dyneins (15Wirschell M. Pazour G. Yoda A. Hirono M. Kamiya R. Witman G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2729-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and may help anchor outer row dyneins to doublet microtubules. However, not all dynein assembly loci encode proteins that function directly in the anchoring of motors to axonemal microtubules. We recently determined that the ODA16 gene product localizes to the soluble flagellar matrix and may act specifically as an assembly factor for intraflagellar transport-dependent transport of outer row dynein motor complexes to the flagellar compartment (16Ahmed N.T. Mitchell D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5004-5012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two additional dynein assembly loci, ODA7 and ODA8, remain uncharacterized at the molecular level, and their exact roles in dynein assembly have not been determined. Here, we characterize the ODA7 gene and the axonemal location of its product. The oda7 mutation blocks outer row dynein assembly and fails to complement mutations in outer row dynein motor subunits in temporary diploid (dikaryon) analysis (17Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2253-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, oda7 cells lack any observable pool of outer row dynein heavy chain α (the oda11 gene product), although they retain normal levels of other motor subunits (13Fowkes M.E. Mitchell D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2337-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), suggesting that oda7 interacts in some unique way with this heavy chain. The α heavy chain is a phosphoprotein (18King S.M. Witman G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5452-5457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whose absence correlates with loss of beat frequency differences between the two flagella of Chlamydomonas (19Sakakibara H. Mitchell D.R. Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), indicating a likely role for this heavy chain in motility regulation. Because of these unique properties, we sought to identify the ODA7 gene product and determine its role in outer row dynein assembly and function. Sequence analysis of the ODA7 gene shows that the gene product is a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) 3The abbreviations used are: LRR, leucine-rich repeat; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome. 3The abbreviations used are: LRR, leucine-rich repeat; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome. protein in the SDS22 protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit family, with orthologs among organisms that have motile cilia. Biochemical analysis indicates that the Oda7 protein interacts with both outer row dynein and I1 inner row dynein and forms a bridge between these two motors on the doublet surface. Its location suggests a role in coordination of dynein isoforms during flagellar motility. Strains and Culture—Chlamydomonas reinhardtii wild type strains 137c, RFLP strain S1D2, and mutant strains arg7, pf9-2, ida2, ida4, ida7, oda1, pf28 (an allele of oda2), oda3, oda4, oda5, oda6, oda7, oda8, oda9, oda11, and oda12 are available from the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center (Duke University, Durham, NC). Double mutant strain oda7,arg7 was constructed and used for chromosome walking experiments and transformation rescue. Strain WS4 (pf28,pf30,ssh1) was constructed by Gianni Piperno (20LeDizet M. Piperno G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and was obtained from Winfield Sale, Emory University, Atlanta, GA. Strain OS12C (pf28,ssh1) was selected from a non-parental ditype tetrad out of a cross of WS4 with pf28 and has normal length paralyzed flagella. The other genotype represented in this tetrad had short paralyzed flagella, typical of strains that contain both an inner row I1 mutation (pf30) and an outer row dynein assembly mutation (pf28). Strain ssh1 (suppressor of short) was selected from a tetratype tetrad out of a cross between OS12C and 137c and shows motility with an altered swimming pattern and a reduced beat frequency. All strains were maintained on minimal M medium (21Sager R. Granick S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1953; 466: 18-30Google Scholar) supplemented as needed with 0.05% l-arginine. For high density liquid cultures and for transformation experiments, cells were grown on acetate-enriched MII medium (21Sager R. Granick S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1953; 466: 18-30Google Scholar). Cloning and Sequencing ODA7—To initiate a walk to the ODA7 locus, strain oda7,arg7 was crossed with wild type RFLP strain S1D2, and 31 random oda7 progeny were selected on minimal medium. All 31 selected strains contain a crossover between the ARG7 and ODA7 loci, which are separated by ∼8 centimorgans on linkage group I. DNA prepared from these strains was used for genomic Southern blots to map the relative positions of RFLP markers and oda7. RFLP marker clones CNC41 and CNA73 (obtained from Carolyn Silflow, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis), Gbp1 (obtained from Judith Berman, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis), and PBT302 (obtained from John Jarvik, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA) were labeled with digoxigenin (Roche Applied Science) for use as hybridization probes on Southern blots and to screen a Chlamydomonas genomic BAC library (available from the Clemson University Genomics Institute, Clemson, SC). BAC end fragments were prepared by gel-isolating unique HindIII fragments or by vectorette PCR (22Riley J. Butler R. Ogilvie D. Finniear R. Jenner D. Powell S. Anand R. Smith J.C. Markham A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2887-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) and were random prime labeled for use as hybridization probes. Genomic sequences surrounding the PBT302 marker, as reported in the Chlamydomonas genome Data Base Version 2.0 (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/chlre2/chlre2.home.html), were examined to identify candidate ODA7 genes, and BAC clones corresponding to the regions of interest were co-transformed with pARG7.8 (arginosuccinate lyase gene plasmid) (23Debuchy R. Purton S. Rochaix J-D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2803-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) into an oda7,arg7 strain by glass bead transformation (24Kindle K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1228-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The resulting colonies were transferred to MI medium in flat bottomed microtiter wells and examined, on an Olympus SZ60 stereoscope with substage darkfield illumination, for restoration of wild type swimming speed. Beat frequency was measured on free swimming cells grown in MI for 18 h with aeration under a 10-h dark, 14-h light cycle, using a Zeiss Axioskop with a ×20 objective under stroboscopic dark field illumination as previously described (25Mitchell D.R. Kang Y. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The light source was passed through a 635-nm band pass filter to reduce phototactic responses. After determining that BAC clone 17H5 could rescue the oda7 mutation, smaller genomic clones were isolated by hybridization screening of a phage genomic library in EMBL4 with a PCR-generated fragment of 17H5. Primer sequences oda7r5 (CCATTTACTTGCAGTCGGTC) and oda7f5 (GCTATGCCTAGCCATTTGAG) used to amplify the probe were selected from the predicted ODA7 coding region, based on Chlamydomonas expressed sequence tag sequences that matched predicted exons of gene model C_410113. Two overlapping phage clones, ODA7λ1 and ODA7λ4, were purified and tested for their ability to rescue the mutation by glass bead transformation as described above. A 5-kb NotI-BamI fragment that spanned the predicted gene was subcloned from ODA7λ4 into pBluescript II (Stratagene) to create pODA7-NB5. cDNA clones were isolated by hybridization screening of a Lambda ZapII cDNA library prepared from vegetative cells (Stress II library, available from the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center, Duke University) with the same probe used to isolate genomic clones (above). The inserts of two selected phage were cloned as pBluescript II plasmids by phagmid excision, sequenced by primer walking on both strands, and determined to be identical to each other. Sequences were assembled and translated using Vector NTI Advance, version 9.0 (Invitrogen) and have been deposited in GenBank™ under accession number DQ886489. Data base comparisons used BLAST (26Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59448) Google Scholar) at NCBI with default parameters. Expressed sequence tag sequences that align with ODA7 were identified through analysis of tracks on the Chlamydomonas Genome v2.0 Internet site and confirmed by BLAST searches of Chlamydomonas expressed sequence tags. Sequence data available on the genome browser were produced by the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, www.jgi.doe.gov/, and are provided for use in this publication only. Antibody Production and Purification—The coding region of cDNA clone pODA7-3 was amplified with primers oda7-3AGf (CCGCGAATTCTGACTAAGGAAGCTCTTCTAGAGG), which introduces an EcoRI site at codon 4, and oda7-3AGr (CCATGGCCTAATTCCAGGTCGTT), which extends beyond the stop codon of the 432-codon Oda7 coding sequence. The amplified product was digested with EcoRI and SalI to generate a 1270-bp fragment (ODA7 codons 4–427), which was cloned into pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences), and a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (Stratagene), gel-purified, and used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits (Covance, Princeton, NJ). For antibody purification, the fusion protein was digested with thrombin, separated by SDS-PAGE on a 7% acrylamide gel, and blotted, and a strip of the blot containing only Oda7p was used as an affinity matrix. Flagellar Isolation and Fractionation—Cells grown in liquid medium were deflagellated by treatment with dibucaine as previously described (27Mitchell B.F. Pedersen L.B. Feely M. Rosenbaum J.L. Mitchell D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4509-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All subsequent steps were at 4 °C or on ice. Flagella were purified by differential centrifugation and rinsed once in HMDEK (30 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 25 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) before preparation for SDS-PAGE (or further fractionation). To remove membranes, flagella were resuspended in HMDEK and then mixed with an equal volume of HMDEK containing a detergent, either Nonidet-P40 (Fluka) or octylglucopyranoside (Sigma) as indicated under “Results.” After trituration with a micropipet, samples were pelleted in a microfuge (16,000 × g) for 10 min and pellets were resuspended to the same volume as supernatant solutions prior to mixing with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer. Demembranation was monitored by the appearance of a high molecular weight membrane glycoprotein (28Bloodgood R.A. Salomonsky N.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in the supernatant, as observed by protein stain after SDS-PAGE. Dynein was extracted into high salt by resuspension of demembranated axonemes in HMDEK supplemented with the indicated concentrations of salts. All extractions proceeded for 30 min on ice, followed by a 20-min spin in a microfuge. Salt extracts were dialyzed versus HMDEK and clarified (16,000 × g, 20 min) prior to further use. Alternatively, to extract dyneins by low ionic strength dialysis (29Gibbons I.R. Arch. Biol. 1965; 76: 317-352PubMed Google Scholar), flagella were resuspended in 1 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0, dialyzed against this solution for 24 h, and centrifuged (16,000 × g, 20 min) to generate pellet and supernatant fractions. To further separate dyneins, extracts were sedimented on 12.5-ml gradients of 5–20% sucrose in HMDEK at 155,000 × g (35,000 rpm in a Beckman SW40 rotor) for 15 h (standard conditions) or on 4.5-ml gradients at 181,000 × g (42,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 60 rotor) for 4.5 h (alternate conditions to preserve intact outer row dynein) (30Takada S. Sakakibara H. Kamiya R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fractions collected from the bottom of the tube were precipitated with 2 volumes acetone and dissolved in SDS sample buffer. Dynein heavy chains (average Mr = 500,000) and Benchmark Protein Ladder (Invitrogen) were used as protein size standards. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp). Affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies to I1 subunits IC140, IC138, and IC97 were provided by Winfield Sale. A monoclonal antibody against outer row dynein IC2 has been previously described (31Mitchell D.R. Rosenbaum J.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1986; 6: 510-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Antibodies were detected with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) using Super Signal West Dura Extend Duration substrate (Pierce). Images were scanned into Adobe Photoshop 6.0 and cropped. Electron Microscopy—Specimens for thin section electron microscopy were prepared as previously described (32Mitchell D.R. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Images were taken using a JEOL 100CXII microscope operated at 80 kV. Negatives were scanned and imported in Adobe Photoshop 6.0; the images were then inverted and adjusted for contrast and median density. Axoneme cross-sections were reoriented so the dyneins projected clockwise. Chromosome Walk to ODA7—Many dynein genes in Chlamydomonas have been identified through analysis of insertional mutants by using the inserted sequence as a tag to clone the disrupted gene. However, despite analysis of 28 insertional mutants that prevented outer row dynein assembly, we were unable to identify insertional mutants at the ODA7 locus. As an alternative we used the one available mutation at oda7, which was generated by ultraviolet irradiation (17Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2253-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), for a genomic walk. Molecular markers that map in the vicinity of ODA7 on linkage group I, including Gbp1, PBT302, CNC41, and CNA73 (33Silflow C.D. Kathir P. Lefebvre P.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 47: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), were used to probe DNA from 31 random recombinants in the ARG7-ODA7 interval. These recombinants were selected from a cross between RFLP strain S1D2 and double mutant strain arg7,oda7. For the Gbp1 and CNA73 markers, all recombinants gave an identical pattern consistent with a marker location telomeric to the test interval. In contrast, the PBT302 and CNC41 markers lay within the interval, as seen by the presence of recombinations between both markers and the oda7 locus in 2 of the 31 strains. Based on this recombination frequency, these markers are within 1 centimorgan of ODA7 (Fig. 1A), which translates on average in the Chlamydomonas genome to ∼100 kb. The PBT302 marker was used to select clones from an indexed BAC library to start the walk. A 200-kb region covered by 17 BAC clones extended this walk beyond one of the two crossovers in the PBT302-ODA7 interval to orient the walk and also identified the relative locations of PBT302 and CNC41 (Fig. 1B), but probes from the end of this walk closest to ODA7 failed to select additional clones in either of two BAC libraries. Compiled genomic sequence data (Chlamydomonas Genome Data Base v2.0) placed PBT302 on sequence scaffold 41 and provided an additional likely contiguous sequence that extended 200 kb beyond the gap at the end of our walk. Because some sequences at the end of scaffold 41 also appear on scaffold 139, portions of this region of the genome data base may retain assembly errors. However, most of the BAC end sequences for clones in our walk appeared at appropriate locations in the scaffold 41 sequence. To identify ODA7 gene candidates, genome data base annotations for appropriate regions of scaffold 41 were analyzed to identify genes whose homologs are expressed exclusively in organisms that have motile cilia or flagella. A single gene met this criterion, C_410113, based on the similarity of its predicted gene product to those of expressed sequence tags derived from mammalian testis cDNA libraries. Sequences from scaffold 41 were used to BLAST the data base of BAC end sequences and identified BAC 17H5 (PTQ6356) as the smallest BAC clone that spanned predicted gene C_410113. Co-transformation of BAC 17H5 and an ARG gene plasmid into an arg7,oda7 strain resulted in rescue of the slow swimming phenotype in 12 of 189 ARG+ colonies, showing that 17H5 can complement the oda7 mutation. Restoration of outer row dyneins was confirmed in one of these co-transformants by both transmission electron microscopy of isolated flagellar axonemes and Western blot of axonemal proteins with an antibody against outer row dynein intermediate chain IC2. To further determine whether C_410113 corresponds to ODA7, we amplified a small region of the presumed coding sequence from BAC 17H5 and used it as a hybridization probe to select smaller genomic and cDNA clones from phage λ libraries. Two overlapping genomic clones selected with this probe were able to rescue the mutant phenotype when transformed into an oda7 strain. The region of overlap between these clones, which spans the presumptive ODA7 gene, was subcloned into a plasmid (Fig. 1C) that also rescued the mutant phenotype. The selected cDNA clone (pODA7-3) was sequenced and contained the complete coding region predicted in the annotation for gene C_410113. Exon I Is Deleted in the oda7 Mutation—Exons of the presumptive ODA7 gene, identified by comparing our cDNA sequence with the reported genomic sequence (supplemental Fig. S1A), were amplified from wild type and oda7 mutant genomic DNA, and amplification products were characterized to confirm the presence of a mutation in the oda7 gene copy. Exons 2–5 amplified from the oda7 strain contained no differences from wild type genomic sequences. However, we were unable to amplify exon 1 from mutant DNA with any of three separate primer pairs, all of which successfully amplified bands of the expected size from wild type DNA (supplemental Fig. S1B). 4D. R. Mitchell and J. Freshour, unpublished observations. A genomic Southern blot probed with the complete cDNA also indicated that the genomic region spanning exon 1 contained an estimated 1.2-kb deletion in the oda7 strain (supplemental Fig. S1C). Oda7 Is an LRR Protein in the SDS22 Family—Our 1812-bp ODA7 cDNA sequence contains a 140-bp 5′-untranslated region, a 376-bp 3′-untranslated region, and an open reading frame that encodes a predicted protein of 432 amino acids (47 kDa). The CD search algorithm (34Marchler-Bauer A. Bryant S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W327-W331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar) identified an LRR domain in the N-terminal half of Oda7 (Fig. 2A). Comparison to known LRR proteins shows that Oda7 is an ortholog of the uncharacterized LRRC50 sequences of mammals (e.g. mouse AAH50751) and puts Oda7p in the SDS22 family (35Kajava A.V. Kobe B. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1082-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The 6 LRR repeats in Oda7 are followed by sequences that typically cap the C terminus of the LRR structure (Fig. 2B). Although axonemal dynein light chains such as Chlamydomonas outer row dynein LC1 are also SDS22 family LRR proteins, Oda7 groups with other related sequences in a subfamily that has diverged from LC1 within the LRR repeat domain and shows no sequence similarity to LC1 within the C-terminal non-LRR domain. Genomes from a wide diversity of eukaryotic phyla each retained only a single gene encoding a protein that grouped with Oda7 by ClustalW analysis (Fig. 2C). Biochemical Characterization of Oda7—Antibodies raised against a bacterially expressed GST-Oda7 fusion protein identify a single 58-kDa band on blots of wild type Chlamydomonas flagellar proteins that partitions after detergent treatment into both insoluble (axonemal) and soluble (membrane/matrix) fractions (Fig. 3A). Comparison of wild type flagella with those of oda mutants shows that Oda7 is retained by all other tested strains except oda7 (Fig. 3B). The strains used in this comparison include several that are only defective in assembly of the dynein catalytic complex (e.g. oda2, 4, 6, 9), strains that disrupt the outer row dynein docking complex (oda1, 3), and strains that disrupt dynein assembly without affecting either of these complexes (oda5, 8) (13Fowkes M.E. Mitchell D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2337-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although the amount of Oda7p retained by oda mutant flagella (other than oda7) was variable, this variability was not related to the strain under analysis but appeared to be due to uncontrollable differences between preparations. In addition, we tested for the retention of Oda7 in flagella from strains lacking radial spokes (pf14, not shown) and inner row dyneins (ida4, ida6, ida7) and only observed a slight reduction in flagellar Oda7 in the ida7 strain, which is defective for assembly of I1 inner row dynein (36Perrone C.A. Yang P.F. O'Toole E. Sale W.S. Porter M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3351-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, C and D). This result was unexpected, as oda7 has no effect on I1 assembly (17Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2253-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, at least three other dynein subunits are thought to function as subunits in both outer row and I1 dyneins, light chains LC7a and LC7b (12DiBella L.M. Sakato M. Patel-King R.S. Pazour G.J. King S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4633-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 37Bowman A.B. Patel-King R.S. Benashski S.E. McCaffery J.M. Goldstein L.S.B. King S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and LC8 (12DiBella L.M. Sakato M. Patel-King R.S. Pazour G.J. King S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4633-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Oda7 is present in both complexes. To test the combined effects of loss of outer row and I1 dyneins, we compared flagellar Oda7 levels in wild type and ida7 to those in WS4 flagellar samples (Fig. 3D). WS4, a triple mutant (pf28,pf30,ssh1), is defective in assembly of both outer row and I1 dyneins and contains a suppressor mutation (suppressor of short1) to support the assembly of full-length flagella when both outer row and I1 dyneins are missing. To control for the effects of ssh1, flagella from a strain containing only the ssh1 mutation were also examined. The combination of both dynein mutations (Fig. 3D, lane WS4) has a consistently greater effect on Oda7 levels than either single dynein assembly defect alone but does not completely prevent flagellar targeting of Oda7. The ssh1 mutation has no apparent effect on the assembly of Oda7. Oda7 Is an Axonemal Protein Associated with Both I1 and Outer Row Dyneins—Most of Oda7 was extracted during demembranation of flagella with Nonidet P-40 detergent (Fig. 3A). When a range of Nonidet P-40 concentrations were compared, more than half of Oda7 was extracted into a soluble fraction at the lowest Nonidet P-40 concentration tested (supplemental Fig. S2A), indicating either that Oda7 resides in part in the matrix or as a membrane-associated protein or that its axonemal association is detergent-sensitive. We tested alternative non-ionic detergents and identified"

Mutation of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of human H2 relaxin (deltaH2) impaired its biological function as measured by cAMP signaling. In a competition assay, deltaH2 exhibited antagonistic activity by blocking recombinant H2 relaxin from binding to receptors on THP-1 cells. In a flow cytometry-based binding assay, deltaH2 demonstrated weak binding to 293T cells expressing the LGR7 receptor in the presence of biotinylated H2 relaxin. When human prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and LNCaP) were engineered to overexpress eGFP, wild-type (WT) H2, or deltaH2, and subsequently implanted into NOD/SCID mice, tumor xenografts overexpressing deltaH2 displayed smaller volumes compared to H2 and eGFP controls. Plasma osmolality readings and microvessel density and area assessment suggest that deltaH2 modulates physiological parameters in vivo. In a second murine model, intratumoral injections of lentivectors engineered to express deltaH2/eGFP led to suppressed tumor growth compared to controls. This study provides further evidence supporting a role for H2 relaxin in prostate tumor growth. More importantly, we report how mutation of the H2 relaxin RBD confers the hormone derivative with antagonistic properties, offering a novel reagent for relaxin research."
https://openalex.org/W2148852695,"Oxidative stress-mediated LDL modification has a key role in initiation of the atherosclerotic process. Platelets produce reactive oxidant species (ROS) upon stimulation with agonist, but it is uncertain whether they are able to oxidatively modify LDL. Human platelets taken from healthy subjects were incubated with LDL, then stimulated with collagen. Compared with unstimulated platelets, collagen-stimulated platelets induced LDL modification as shown by enhanced conjugated dienes and lysophosphatidylcholine formation, electrophoretic mobility, Apo B-100 degradation, and monocyte LDL uptake. Activated platelets also induced a marked reduction of vitamin E contained in LDL. A significant inhibition of LDL oxidation was observed in platelets treated with arachidonyl trifluomethyl ketone (AACOCF3), an inhibitor of phospholipase A2. The experiments reported above were also conducted in patients with hereditary deficiency of gp91phox, the central core of NADPH oxidase, and in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Platelets from gp91 phox-deficient patients produced a small amount of ROS and weakly modified LDL. Conversely, platelets from hypercholesterolemic patients showed enhanced ROS formation and oxidized LDL more than platelets from healthy subjects. This study provides evidence that platelets modify LDL via NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative stress, a phenomenon that could be dependent on arachidonic acid activation. This finding suggests a role for platelets in favoring LDL accumulation within atherosclerotic plaque."
https://openalex.org/W2064640604,"HFE mutations have traditionally been associated with the iron overload disorder known as hemochromatosis. Recently, it has become clear that the two most common mutations in the HFE gene, H63D and C282Y, may be genetic modifiers for risk of neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, respectively. We developed human neuroblastoma stable cell lines that express either wild-type (WT) or mutant HFE to determine the cellular consequences of the mutant forms of HFE. The presence of the C282Y mutation was associated with relatively higher labile iron pool and iron regulatory protein activity than WT or H63D HFE. Targeted gene arrays revealed that the signal transduction pathway was up-regulated in the C282Y cells. H63D cells had higher levels of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and lower mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting higher baseline stress. This cell line was also more vulnerable to exposure to oxidative stress agents and more responsive to iron chelation than the C282Y cells. These data demonstrate that the different mutations in the HFE gene have unique effects on the cells and provide insights into how the different mutations may have different clinical consequences. The results also raise multiple novel questions for future study about the function of the HFE protein."
https://openalex.org/W2090711088,"Recently we reported a differentiation-dependent inhibition of telomerase activity in human epidermis. Consistent with this observation we found that in keratinocyte cultures calcium-induced differentiation correlates with a decline in telomerase activity. To get further support for a role of calcium in the regulation of telomerase and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms we investigated the effect of calcium on telomerase in the human epidermal keratinocyte line HaCaT. Treatment with thapsigargin, which increases intracellular calcium concentrations, inhibited telomerase activity without down-regulating the expression of hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase). This observation together with the fact that increasing calcium reduced telomerase activity in cell-free extracts suggests that calcium directly interacts with the telomerase complex. This interaction could be mediated by the calcium-binding protein S100A8 as indicated by its ability to mimic the inhibitory effect of calcium. S100A8-induced reduction in telomerase activity was abrogated by S100A9. The ratio of both proteins remained constant in cells treated with thapsigargin, but their interactions were altered similarly in intact cells after thapsigargin treatment and in cell-free extracts in response to calcium. We hypothesize that calcium binds to S100A8/S100A9 complexes and alters their composition, thus enabling S100A8 to interact with the telomerase complex and inhibit its activity.

The enzyme telomerase stabilizes the length of telomeres, the ends of linear chromosomes, by de novo addition of telomeric repeats, which have been lost due to incomplete DNA replication, nucleolytic degradation, and oxidative stress. The maintenance of telomeres and thus telomerase appear to play a critical role in senescence, aging, and cancer (1Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar).

Human telomerase also contains multiple accessory proteins, which bind either to hTR or hTERT, thus forming a large ribonucleoprotein complex with a molecular weight of more than 1000 kDa (4Harrington L. Cancer Lett. 2003; 194: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Whereas hTR is widely expressed (2Feng J. Funk W.D. Wang S.S. Weinrich S.L. Avilion A.A. Chiu C.P. Adams R.R. Chang E.

Telomerase activity is observed in about 85% of all human tumors and during the last couple of years its inhibition has become an attractive tool for therapeutic intervention. For a long time it was believed that in the non-pathological situation telomerase is only functional during embryonic development and in the germ line of the adult organism, whereas normal somatic cells are telomerase-negative. Now it is generally accepted that also cells of highly proliferative and periodically or continuously renewing tissues, such as the hematopoietic system and the epidermis show telomerase activity (8Broccoli D. Young J.W. de Lange T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9082-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 9Harle-Bachor C. Boukamp P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6476-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In epidermis telomerase activity is restricted to basal actively proliferating keratinocytes and is inhibited upon differentiation (9Harle-Bachor C. Boukamp P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6476-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). We showed that this inhibition of telomerase is not a mere consequence of differentiation but rather a prerequisite for this process. In an organotypic co-culture model constitutive expression of hTERT in HaCaT cells did not abolish differentiation per se as indicated by histochemical and immunofluorescence analyses. However, whereas stratification and early stages of epidermal differentiation were unaffected, terminal differentiation was blocked (10Cerezo A. Stark H.J. Moshir S. Boukamp P. J. Invest Dermatol. 2003; 121: 110-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying this differentiation-dependent decline in telomerase activity are still unknown. Even the regulation of epidermal differentiation itself is only poorly understood, but experimental evidence points to calcium as a key regulator of this process (11Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 12Hennings H. Holbrook K. Steinert P. Yuspa S. Curr. Probl.

Subsequent studies of our laboratory suggested that calcium could also play a functional role in the inhibition of telomerase activity in epidermal keratinocytes (18Bickenbach J.R. Vormwald-Dogan V. Bachor C. Bleuel K. Schnapp G. Boukamp P. J. Invest Dermatol. 1998; 111: 1045-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We found that the inhibition of telomerase activity by differentiation-inducing factors, such as thapsigargin, correlated with their ability to increase intracellular calcium levels. Furthermore, calcium appeared to inhibit telomerase activity directly in a differentiation-independent manner in a cell-free system. However, the mechanism, through which calcium exhibited its inhibitory effect, remained unclear. Calcium is an intracellular second messenger, which regulates a variety of biological processes. In most cases calcium does not act directly but uses calcium-binding proteins as mediators of its signals. Calcium binds to these calcium-binding proteins and induces conformational changes, thus exposing initially inaccessible protein binding sites and allowing their interaction with specific target proteins (19Smith S.P. Shaw G.S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Among the calcium-binding proteins are the S100 proteins S100A8 (calgranulin A; MRP8) and S100A9 (calgranulin B; MRP14). The genes for S100A8 and S100A9 are co-localized and clustered with genes coding for various epidermal differentiation markers in the so-called epidermal differentiation complex (20Mischke D. Korge B.P. Marenholz I. Volz A. Ziegler A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 989-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 21Volz A. Korge B.P. Compton J.G. Ziegler A. Steinert P.M.

S100A8 and S100A9 appear to be expressed in normal skin only at very low levels (23Broome A.M. Ryan D. Eckert R.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), but their expression is up-regulated during differentiation (24Eckert R.L. Broome A.M. Ruse M. Robinson N. Ryan D. Lee K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2004; 123: 23-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and correlates in epithelial cell lines with their ability to terminally differentiate (25Saintigny G. Schmidt R. Shroot B. Juhlin L. Reichert U. Michel S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For this reason they present excellent candidates for regulating epidermal differentiation and are potential mediators of the effect of calcium on telomerase activity. The purpose of the present study was to further elucidate the functional role of calcium in differentiation-dependent inhibition of telomerase activity and to determine the function of S100A8 and S100A9 in this process. Advancing our understanding of the complex process of telomerase regulation during differentiation may help to develop a physiological strategy to eliminate telomerase in tumors, thus compromising their growth. Cell Culture—The human keratinocyte line HaCaT was maintained in 4× Eagle’s minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (PS) at 37 °C as described previously (26Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar). HaCaT cells stably transfected with S100A8, S100A9, both, or vector alone were maintained in 4× MEM/FCS/PS supplemented with neomycin (Geneticin; Invitrogen; 1.2 mg/ml) and/or puromycin (Sigma; 0.8 μg/ml). Cells were routinely passaged every 10 days at a dilution of 1:10. Unless stated otherwise, for experiments 7.5 × 105 cells per 10-cm plate were plated and grown to 40–50% confluence. Where indicated, cells were treated with thapsigargin (Molecular Probes) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) and added to 4× MEM/FCS/PS to a final concentration of 1 μm; controls were treated with equal amounts of dimethyl sulfoxide. After 30 min at 37 °C, the medium was replaced by 4× MEM/FCS/PS without additives. At various time points cells were harvested by incubation with 0.05% EDTA/0.025% trypsine, washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Isolation of Nuclear Protein—Crude nuclear protein extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (27Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors (complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Diagnostics) and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. The extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration of the extracts was determined with Bio-Rad reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Telomere Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) Assay—Telomerase activity was detected by the PCR-based TRAP using the TRAPeze telomerase detection kit (Qbiogene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Instead of cell lysates 5 ng of nuclear protein were used. Where indicated, the TRAP assay was performed in the presence of various concentrations of calcium chloride (50, 100, 250, and 500 μm) or human recombinant S100A8 and/or S100A9, respectively, bovine serum albumin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) (1, 2, 5, and 10 ng/μl) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The recombinant S100A8 and S100A9 were generously provided by Drs. Claus Kerkhoff and Clemens Sorg (University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany). Western Blot Analysis—25 μg (anti-hTERT) or 10 μg (anti-S100A8 and anti-S100A9) nuclear protein were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Samples were electrophoresed through a 3% stacking gel and resolved in a 6% (anti-hTERT) or 15% (anti-S100A8 and anti-S100A9) separating gel in 25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (BA-S85; Schleicher & Schuell) by electroblotting at 16 volts at 4 °C for 12–16 h using a transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The membrane was blocked in 10% low fat (1.5%) milk in PBST (PBS, 0.5% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibody was added at a dilution of 1:500 in milk/PBST. The membrane was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then washed six times for 5 min with milk/PBST. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG was added at a dilution of 1:20,000 in milk/PBST. The membrane was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then washed six times for 5 min with milk/PBST. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Antibodies used were as follows: monoclonal mouse anti-hTERT (clone 44F12; Novocastra Laboratories), monoclonal mouse anti-S100A8 (clone 8-5C2; Acris), monoclonal mouse anti-S100A9 (clone S32.2; Acris), polyclonal rabbit anti-fibrillarin (Abcam), and horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova). Transfection—The full-length coding sequences for human S100A8 and S100A9 including start and stop codons, as well as an additional NheI site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end were amplified from the vectors pBUD CE 4.1-hMRP8 and pBUD CE 4.1-hMRP14 (kindly provided by SWITCH Biotech GmbH, Munich, Germany) and cloned into the mammalian expression vectors pIRESneo and pIRESpuro (Clontech). 20 μg of plasmid were transfected into HaCaT keratinocytes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After selection with neomycin (Geneticin, 1.2 mg/ml) and/or puromycin (Sigma; 0.8 μg/ml) clones were picked and analyzed for transgene expression by Northern blot analyses. siRNA—ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNAs specific for S100A8, S100A9, or non-target control siRNAs (Dharmacon) were introduced into HaCaT keratinocytes by transfection using DharmaFECT according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cross-linking—Proteins were cross-linked with 1.5 mm bis(sulfosuccimidmidyl)suberate (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the reactions were quenched with 10 mm ethanolamine, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature. Recently we reported a differentiation-dependent inhibition of telomerase activity in human epidermis and in primary human skin keratinocytes (9Harle-Bachor C. Boukamp P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6476-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 18Bickenbach J.R. Vormwald-Dogan V. Bachor C. Bleuel K. Schnapp G. Boukamp P. J. Invest Dermatol. 1998; 111: 1045-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To investigate this phenomenon in more detail and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms we induced differentiation in exponentially growing HaCaT cells by treating them for 30 min with 1 μm thapsigargin. This factor raises intracellular calcium levels by inhibiting the Ca2+-ATPases of the endoplasmic reticulum (28Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar, 29Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control cells were treated with equal amounts of the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide. Induction of differentiation was monitored by immunofluorescence analyses for the early differentiation markers keratin 1/keratin 10 and involucrin and for the late differentiation markers filaggrin and transglutaminase, all of which were elevated in response to thapsigargin (data not shown). At various time points crude nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed for their telomerase activity by TRAP assay. The results are shown in Fig. 1. Dimethyl sulfoxide-treated controls showed a basal telomerase activity, which was significantly reduced after thapsigargin treatment. Thapsigargin-induced inhibition of telomerase activity was already detectable at around day 1. The thapsigargin effect was most prominent at around day 3. Subsequently telomerase activity gradually increased until reaching control levels at around day 9 (data not shown). To determine whether thapsigargin-mediated inhibition of telomerase activity is due to an inhibition of telomerase expression we first examined steady state protein levels of hTERT, the rate-limiting component of telomerase, in the HaCaT protein extracts, which had been analyzed by TRAP assay by Western blot analysis. Fig. 2A reveals no significant changes in the hTERT protein expression profile after thapsigargin treatment throughout the entire time course up to 6 days. These results indicate that thapsigargin-mediated inhibition of telomerase activity does not result from reduced hTERT expression and thus an insufficient number of telomerase complexes but suggest that calcium directly affects the complex. To confirm calcium as the mediator of the thapsigargin effect, we tested its ability to directly inhibit telomerase activity in a cell-free, gene expression-independent system. For this purpose we analyzed crude nuclear extracts of HaCaT cells for their telomerase activity in the presence of various amounts of calcium (50, 100, 250, and 500 μm) by TRAP assay. As shown in Fig. 2B treatment with low concentrations of calcium had only a slight effect on telomerase activity, whereas 250 and 500 μm calcium resulted in a significant inhibition of telomerase activity. To exclude the possibility that decreased telomerase activity in response to calcium was due to unspecific degradation of the telomerase complex by calcium-activated proteases or RNases present in the cell-free extract we repeated the experiments including the respective inhibitors. Neither treatment with protease inhibitors nor the presence of RNase inhibitors could abrogate the calcium effect (data not shown). Taken together these data indicate a direct role of calcium in inhibiting telomerase activity independent of gene expression. Based on their differentiation-correlated expression pattern and their property to be modulated in their activities by calcium, S100A8 and S100A9 have established themselves as potential components of the intracellular calcium signaling pathway in epidermal differentiation (24Eckert R.L. Broome A.M. Ruse M. Robinson N. Ryan D. Lee K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2004; 123: 23-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). To test whether these calcium-binding proteins could be involved in mediating the inhibitory effect of calcium on telomerase activity we added various amounts of human recombinant S100A8 or S100A9 or bovine serum albumin as control to crude nuclear extracts of HaCaT cells and analyzed the effects on telomerase activity by TRAP assay. The results are presented in Fig. 3A. Addition of bovine serum albumin had no effect on telomerase activity, whereas S100A8 inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner. The S100A8-induced inhibition of telomerase activity was already detectable at a concentration of 1 ng/μl and further increased at 2 and 5 ng/μl. In contrast, S100A9 did not alter telomerase activity. Since S100A8 and S100A9 are able to form heterodimers or higher order complexes with one another (30Hunter M.J. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12427-12435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the inhibitory effect of S100A8 could be influenced by S100A9 by adding 5 ng/μl S100A8 together with various amounts of S100A9 (2, 5, and 10 ng/μl). As presented in Fig. 3B, when S100A9 was added together with S100A8 at a concentration of 2 ng/μl the effect of S100A8 was not altered. The addition of equal (5 ng/μl) or higher (10 ng/μl) amounts of S100A9, however, resulted in an efficient abrogation of S100A8-mediated inhibition of telomerase activity. Similar results were obtained when the extracts were preincubated with S100A8 for 1 h before S100A9 was added (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that both S100A8 and S100A9 are involved in telomerase regulation and that S100A9 controls the effect of S100A8. When S100A8 is present in excess telomerase activity is inhibited. S100A9 counteracts this inhibition and when equal or higher amounts of S100A9 are available telomerase activity is not altered. To test whether the inhibition of telomerase activity by S100A8, we found under cell-free conditions could also be observed in intact cells we generated HaCaT keratinocytes stably transfected with an expression construct for S100A8. Five S100A8 overexpressing HaCaT clones were analyzed for their telomerase activity (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly S100A8 overexpression did not reduce telomerase activity and telomerase activity did not correlate with S100A8 expression levels. Previous studies have reported that S100A8 and S100A9 are frequently co-expressed (31Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus-Hager G. Karas M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13462-13467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggested that their expression is coordinately regulated (31Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus-Hager G.

Thus, overexpression of S100A8 in HaCaT keratinocytes may lead to a simultaneous up-regulation of S100A9. To test this possibility we compared S100A8 and S100A9 protein levels in S100A8 transfectants. As shown in Fig. 4B S100A8 transfectants also had high levels of S100A9. We additionally transfected HaCaT cells with an expression construct for S100A9 and expression constructs for S100A8 and S100A9. In all clones tested we found a constant ratio of S100A8 and S100A9 (Fig. 4B). To obtain further proof for a coordinate regulation of S100A8 and S100A9 in HaCaT keratinocytes, we independently knocked down S100A8 and S100A9 with siRNAs specific for these proteins. Down-regulation of S100A8 protein correlated with down-regulation of S100A9 protein and vice versa (Fig. 5A) and had no effect on telomerase activity (Fig. 5B). These results clearly demonstrate a coordinately regulated expression of these two calcium-binding proteins. Furthermore, these data confirm that the effect of S100A8 on telomerase activity does not depend on the absolute level of S100A8 but its amount relative to S100A9. Telomerase activity is only reduced when S100A8 protein levels are higher than S100A9 protein levels.FIGURE 5A, knock-down of S100A8 protein in HaCaT cells also knocks down S100A9 protein and vice versa. Western blot analysis (10 μg of protein) of HaCaT keratinocytes transfected with SMARTpool siRNAs specific for S100A8, S100A9, or non-target control siRNAs. At the indicated time points (4 and 5 days after transfection) cells were harvested, crude nuclear extracts were prepared, and steady state protein levels of S100A8 and S100A9 were determined using antibodies specific for S100A8 or S100A9. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was used as secondary antibody. Protein expression levels of fibrillarin as loading control were determined using an antibody specific for fibrillarin and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence. B, knock-down of S100A8 or S100A9 protein does not alter telomerase activity.

The results shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether thapsigargin-induced inhibition of telomerase activity could result from a shift in the ratio of S100A8 to S100A9 in favor of S100A8, we determined the steady state levels of these proteins in response to thapsigargin. We treated exponentially growing HaCaT cells for 30 min with 1 μm thapsigargin or equal amounts of dimethyl sulfoxide. At various time points crude nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 6 thapsigargin does not significantly alter the protein levels of S100A8 and S100A9. Thapsigargin does neither increase S100A8 expression nor decrease S100A9 expression to shift the ratio of S100A8 to S100A9 in favor of S100A8. When present at equal or higher amounts S100A9 prevents S100A8 from reducing telomerase activity. This occurs most likely by sequestering S100A8 in heterodimeric or higher order complexes. Coordinate up- or down-regulation of S100A8 and S100A9 should lead to similar changes in the amount of these complexes. To verify this idea we analyzed S100A8/S100A9 complexes in S100A8/S100A9-overexpressing HaCaT clones and in HaCaT cells, in which S100A8/S100A9 expression had been knocked-down by siRNA. For this purpose we covalently cross-linked non-covalently associated proteins by treatment with bis-(sulfosuccimidmidyl)suberate for 1 h at room temperature. S100A8 and S100A9 complexes were then detected by Western blot analysis. Fig. 7A shows cross-linked versus non-cross-linked crude nuclear extracts of exponentially growing HaCaT cells revealing that neither S100A8 nor S100A9 exist as free monomers but form complexes with each other and potentially other proteins. Four major complexes with apparent molecular weights of 50, 45, 32, and 25 kDa were detected. In S100A8/S100A9 overexpressing HaCaT clones the amount of all four complexes was increased and correlated with the expression levels of S100A8 and S100A9 (Fig. 7B). Knock-down of S100A8 or S100A9, on the other hand, resulted in coordinate down-regulation of these complexes (Fig. 7C). Hypothetically, calcium could interact with these complexes and alter their composition. These alterations could lead to the release of S100A8 and allow its interaction with telomerase. In this scenario thapsigargin would keep the overall ratio of S100A8 to S100A9 constant but increase the ratio of free, telomerase-inhibiting S100A8. To test this hypothesis we analyzed the effect of thapsigargin on S100"
https://openalex.org/W2091480580,"Post-translational arginylation consists of the covalent union of an arginine residue to a Glu, Asp, or Cys amino acid at the N-terminal position of proteins. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme arginyl-tRNA protein transferase. Using mass spectrometry, we have recently demonstrated in vitro the post-translational incorporation of arginine into the calcium-binding protein calreticulin (CRT). To further study arginylated CRT we raised an antibody against the peptide (RDPAIYFK) that contains an arginine followed by the first 7 N-terminal amino acids of mature rat CRT. This antibody specifically recognizes CRT obtained from rat soluble fraction that was arginylated in vitro and also recognizes endogenous arginylated CRT from NIH 3T3 cells in culture, indicating that CRT arginylation takes place in living cells. Using this antibody we found that arginylation of CRT is Ca2+-regulated. In vitro and in NIH 3T3 cells in culture, the level of arginylated CRT increased with the addition of a Ca2+ chelator to the medium, whereas a decreased arginine incorporation into CRT was found in the presence of Ca2+. The arginylated CRT was observed in the cytosol, in contrast to the non-arginylated CRT that is in the endoplasmic reticulum. Under stress conditions, arginylated CRT was found associated to stress granules. These results suggest that CRT arginylation occurs in the cytosolic pool of mature CRT (defined by an Asp acid N-terminal) that is probably retrotranslocated from the endoplasmic reticulum.

The complex mechanism of post-translational modification of proteins is important for the regulation of cell functions. One of these post-translational modifications remaining poorly understood is the incorporation of arginine into the N terminus of proteins (1Kaji H. Novelli G.D. Kaji A.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Hallak M.E. Neurochem. Res. 2006; 31: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Calreticulin is a Ca2+-binding protein that is highly concentrated in the lumen of the ER. This protein functions as a chaperone involved in the control of newly synthesized proteins and as a modulator of Ca2+ signaling and Ca2+ homeostasis (10Michalak M. Corbett E.F. Mesaeli N.

The primary translation product of rat CRT contains a 17-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide that leads the nascent protein to the ER. As the protein translocates to the lumen of the ER this peptide is co-translationally cleaved, giving rise to the mature protein that contains an aspartic acid exposed at the N terminus (14Denning G. Leidal K.G. Holst V. Iyer S. Pearson D. Clark J. Nauseef W. Clark R.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 372-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C terminus end of CRT contains a KDEL ER retrieval sequence (15Fliegel L. Burns K. MacLennan D.H. Reithmeier R.A. Michalak M. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, numerous functions of this protein such as nuclear export receptor activity, anti-thrombotic activity, modulation of cell adhesion, and its integrin-dependent Ca2+ signaling (17Holaska J.M.

The presence of CRT in the cytosol, as well as the origin of this cytosolic CRT, is still a matter of controversy. It has been reported that cytosolic CRT could be produced either by retrotranslocation from the lumen to cytoplasmic compartments or by an inefficient CRT translocation to the ER (21Afshar N. Black B. Paschal B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8844-8853Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Shaffer K.L. Sharma A. Snapp E.L. Hegde R.S. Dev.

Rabilloud T. Garin J. Hallak M.E. Neurochem. Res. 2006; 31: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) it has had not been determined whether arginine was incorporated on native CRT or on mature CRT (which contains an acidic amino acid as acceptor residue; Ref. 14Denning G. Leidal K.G. Holst V. Iyer S. Pearson D. Clark J. Nauseef W. Clark R.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 372-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our hypothesis is that arginine is incorporated in mature CRT (9Decca M.B. Bosc C. Luche S. Brugière S. Job D. Rabilloud T. Garin J. Hallak M.E. Neurochem. Res. 2006; 31: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) by the arginyl transferase that specifically adds arginine to acidic N-terminal amino acids (4Soffer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1602-1606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the cytosolic distribution of this enzyme, it was unclear whether arginylation of CRT was an ER lumenal or a cytosolic event. In the present study we demonstrate that arginylation of CRT occurs on a cytosolic pool of mature CRT and that this modification is regulated by Ca2+. Chemical Reagents—Chemical reagents, protease inhibitors, and prestained molecular weight standard mixture were purchased from Sigma. Preparation of Rat Brain Soluble Extract—Soluble brain extract from rat was prepared as described (23Hallak M.E. Bongiovanni G. Barra H.S. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, brains were homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EGTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (100 μm leupeptin, 100 μm bestatin, 200 μm N-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μm amastatin). The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was filtered through a Bio-Gel P6 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing protease inhibitors. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Incorporation of [14C]Arginine into Proteins of Soluble Brain Extract—Proteins of soluble extracts were arginylated as described by Hallak et al. (23Hallak M.E. Bongiovanni G. Barra H.S. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The incubation system consisted of 7 mg/ml of protein from soluble brain extract, 10 μm [14C]arginine (3 μCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1 mm ATP, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, and protease inhibitors. Standard 14C incorporation assay contained also 1 mm EGTA. To determine the effect of Ca2+ in the [14C]arginine incorporation into CRT, CaCl2 was varied from 0 to 2 mm and EGTA from 0 to 1 mm. Where indicated, 60 pg/ml of bovine CRT (Sigma) was added to the soluble brain extract. After incubation at 37 °C for 45 min, arginine incorporation was stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar). Cell Cultures—NIH 3T3 cells were plated in 100-mm Petri dishes coated with poly-l-lysine and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For intracellular Ca2+ depletion, NIH 3T3 cells were washed twice with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and incubated for 15 min with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 3 mm EGTA and 2 μm thapsigargin (TG) (dissolved in Me2SO 0.65% w/v) or 10 μm BAPTA AM and 2 μm TG. The concentration of Me2SO in the culture medium was 0.02% (v/v) also in control cells. Preparation of Cell Lysate—NIH 3T3 cells were grown to 90% confluence, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.76 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, and disrupted in lysis buffer (radioimmune precipitation buffer) containing 1% w/w Nonidet P-40, 1% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% w/v SDS, 10 mm Na3PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.2. After 10 min at 0 °C the cells were scraped. Total protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation—The stress granule component TIA-1 was immunoprecipitated using an anti-TIA-1 pAb C20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using standard protocols. In brief, 3 μl of anti-TIA-1 polyclonal Ab were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer. The suspension was briefly centrifuged and the pellet washed twice with radioimmune precipitation buffer. Then, cell lysate (300–500 μg of protein) was added to the suspension, and the mixture was rotated overnight at 4 °C. The suspension was briefly centrifuged and the supernatant discarded. The protein G-Sepharose-C20 antibody-TIA-1 complex was washed five times with 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer prior to the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Electrophoresis, Autoradiography, and Immunodetection of Proteins—Proteins from soluble brain extract, cell lysate, and immunoprecipitated materials were separated using SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar) and were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3344-3352Crossref Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). As primary antibodies, we used mouse anti-CRT mAb (1:2500) (BD Biosciences) that specifically recognizes the C-terminal end of CRT, goat anti-TIA-1 (C20) pAb (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a rabbit anti-arginylated-CRT (R-CRT) pAb (dilution 1:60) specific for arginylated calreticulin (this work). The polyclonal antibody R-CRT was custom designed by Eurogentec (Belgium) and directed against the peptide RDPAIYFK coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. This peptide corresponds to the N-terminal sequence of the mature form of calreticulin (devoid of the signal peptide amino acids 1–17), with an arginine residue (bolded) added at the N-terminal end. The rabbit IgGs with affinity for the peptide RDPAIYFK were affinity-purified onto a column linked with the peptide RDPAIYFK and then eluted with 0.5 m SCNK. In a second affinity chromatography, the peptide DPAIYFK was used to retain IgGs nonspecific of the arginylated peptide. As secondary antibodies we used biotinylated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG (H+L) and horse anti-goat IgG (H+L) (1:15000) (Vector Labs). The nitrocellulose membrane was probed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (1:60000) (Amersham Biosciences) that was visualized by the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). After immunostaining, the 14C-arginylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. To determine the relative sensitivity of the R-CRT antibody with respect to the CRT antibody, known amounts of purified rat CRT were 14C-arginylated in vitro (see above), and the samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to autoradiography and to Western blot analysis with anti-R-CRT and anti-CRT antibodies. To quantify the degree of arginylation, the band corresponding to CRT was excised from the membrane and the radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. The corresponding densitometric analysis of CRT from each antibody was performed using the image analysis system function of the METAMORPH 3.0 software. From the analysis of these data, it was found that the R-CRT antibody is 170 times more sensitive than the CRT antibody. Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence, NIH 3T3 cells were grown on glass coverslips to 60% confluence. Cell cultures were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 3% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS containing 4% w/v sucrose for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% v/v Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and then treated with 5% w/v bovine serum albumin for 2 h before the addition of antibodies. Cells were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with primary antibodies and for 2 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies. All antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 5% w/v bovine serum albumin. As primary antibodies, we used rabbit R-CRT pAb (1:60) to detect arginylated CRT, mouse anti-CRT mAb (1:2500) and rabbit anti-CRT (PA3–900) pAb (1:100) (Affinity Bioreagents) to detect CRT, and goat anti-TIA-1(C20) pAb (1:100) to detect TIA-1. As secondary antibodies we used Alexa Fluor 543-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) (Molecular Probes), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) (Molecular Probes), and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:1000) (Molecular Probes). Control for the cross-talk between the fluorophores was negligible. However, for double staining, TIA-1 and R-CRT (or CRT) labeling were performed sequentially, starting with TIA-1 labeling. Image Acquisition—Confocal images were captured with an inverted Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal laser confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jenna, Germany), using a 63/1.4 or 100/1.4 Plan-Apochromat objective. Pinholes were set for a nominal axial resolution <0.6 μm. Excitation on the LSM 5 Pascal laser confocal microscope was with a 25-milliwatt argon laser emitting at 488 nm or with a 1-milliwatt helium/neon laser emitting at 543 nm. Emissions were collected using a 505 to 530-nm band pass filter for Alexa 488 or a 560 to 615-nm band pass filter for Alexa 543 emission. Immunodetection of 14C-Arginylated Calreticulin by Anti-R-CRT Antibody—We raised an antibody against a peptide containing the first 7 N-terminal amino acids of mature rat CRT with an additional arginine residue at the N terminus of the peptide (RDPAIYFK). This antibody (anti-R-CRT) and one that specifically recognizes CRT (anti-CRT) were used to analyze the in vivo arginylation of CRT. To demonstrate that anti-R-CRT antibody specifically recognizes R-CRT, the soluble fraction of rat brain homogenates was in vitro arginylated with [14C]arginine for different periods of times. Autoradiography of the 14C-arginylated proteins shows increasing [14C] arginine incorporation during time into several proteins, including CRT at 57 kDa (Fig. 1A). Total CRT remains constant during the time course as determined by Western blot of the extracts with an antibody (anti-CRT) that recognizes the C-terminal region of CRT (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the anti-R-CRT immunostaining progressively increases, at least up to 140 min of incubation (Fig. 1C), with concomitant increase in the [14C]arginine incorporated by this protein (Fig. 1A). This result indicates that the anti-R-CRT antibody directed against the putative N terminus of the arginylated mature CRT is specific for the arginylated form of CRT, because it was the only band detected after the in vitro arginylation. Effect of Ca2+ on the CRT Arginylation—Calreticulin is a Ca2+-binding protein whose tertiary structure is modified by this cation (26Li Z. Stafford W.F. Bouvier M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11193-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Corbett E.F. Michalak K.M. Oikawa K. Johnson S. Campbell I. Eggleton P. Kay C. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27177-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the arginylation of CRT is affected by the concentration of Ca2+. A soluble fraction from rat brain was 14C-arginylated in vitro in the presence of different Ca2+ concentrations. We found that the increase of Ca2+ concentration specifically inhibits the [14C]arginine incorporation into CRT (Fig. 2A). The [14C]arginine incorporation was also assayed as a function of the Ca2+ chelator EGTA. Increasing EGTA concentration increases the amount of [14C]arginine incorporated into CRT (Fig. 2B), further indicating that Ca2+ has an inhibitory effect on the arginylation of CRT. When EGTA was omitted in the incubation system, anti-R-CRT immunostaining became negligible, whereas no variation was observed for total CRT (Fig. 2C, compare lane 2 with lane 1). To improve sensitivity in the [14C]arginine incorporation assay, we added purified mature bovine CRT to the incubation system and arginylation assays were performed in the presence of different amounts of Ca2+ or EGTA. Mature bovine CRT was chosen as substrate of arginylation because it has a potential arginine acceptor (glutamic acid) at the N terminus and N-terminal sequence similar to that in rat CRT. We observed that bovine CRT arginylation is also modulated by Ca2+ levels (Fig. 2, A′ and B′). Ca2+ modulation of the [14C]arginine incorporation seems to be specific for CRT because the 14C arginylation of the other protein substrates was not affected by the addition of calcium or of EGTA (Fig. 2, A and B). Arginylation of CRT in Cultured Cells—In addition to the soluble fraction of rat brain, the incorporation of [14C]arginine in CRT was also found in the soluble fraction from COS, Chinese hamster ovary, and NIH 3T3 cells. It was deemed of importance to examine whether CRT arginylation occurs in vivo. This was addressed in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in culture. These cells showed one of the highest [14C]arginine incorporation rates in CRT; in addition, the N-terminal sequence used to generate the anti-R-CRT antibody is common to both mouse and rat CRT. The existence of an arginylated isoform of CRT in NIH 3T3 cells was evident in both immunocytochemistry and immunoblot assays. Immunocytochemical assay of NIH 3T3 cells with the anti-R-CRT antibody reveals a scarce, cytosolic-like immunostaining of R-CRT (Fig. 3A, b) with occasional cluster distribution. It is worth noting that the immunostaining for R-CRT lacks the typical ER appearance characteristic of CRT (Fig. 3A, a) and that both stainings do not overlap (Fig. 3A, c). These results indicate that R-CRT is present in cells and that it shows an intracellular localization different from that of lumenal CRT. Moreover, when total proteins from NIH 3T3 cells are subjected to immunoblot and probed with the R-CRT antibody, a 57-kDa band is recognized by this antibody (Fig. 3B, lane 1), indicating the presence of endogenous R-CRT. Arginylated CRT and CRT from NIH 3T3 cells show the same electrophoretic mobility, as determined by immunostaining with an antibody that recognizes the C-terminal region of CRT (Fig. 3B, lane 3). Taking into account the different sensitivities of the used antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”), we determined by scanning of the Western blots and subsequent densitometric quantification of R-CRT and CRT signals that in whole cells R-CRT represents 0.05% of total CRT. Considering that cytosolic CRT in these cells represents 2% of the total CRT (21Afshar N. Black B. Paschal B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8844-8853Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the arginylated isoform accounts for 2.5% of the cytosolic CRT. To address whether CRT arginylation in cells is also regulated by Ca2+, NIH 3T3 cells were treated with 2 μm TG, a sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor capable of depleting lumenal Ca2+ (28Treiman M. Kaspersen C. Christensen S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 131-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), plus 3 mm EGTA or with 2 μm TG plus 10 μm BAPTA-AM, a membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator. The use of the Ca2+ chelators EGTA or BAPTA-AM with the inhibitor TG leads to a decrease in the levels of cytosolic Ca2+ (29Holaska J.M. Black B.E. Rastinejad F. Paschal B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6286-6297Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 30Caspersen C. Sten Pedersen P. Treiman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22363-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We found a significant increase in the level of R-CRT after TG/EGTA treatment both by immunocytochemistry with the anti-R-CRT antibody (Fig. 3A, compare e with b) and by Western blot (Fig. 3B, compare lane 2 with lane 1). After scanning of the Western blots, a densitometric quantification of R-CRT levels reveals 100% increase of arginylated calreticulin in TG/EGTA-treated cells with respect to control cells (Fig. 3C, a). The level of total CRT, detected with the antibody that recognizes the C-terminal region of CRT (anti-CRT) (Fig. 3C, b), was also increased in TG/EGTA-treated cells, although this increment is lower than that for R-CRT. In accordance with these results, it has been reported that TG treatment promotes an increase in CRT gene expression (31Waser M. Mesaeli N. Spencer C. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry analysis reveals that TG/BAPTA-AM and TG/EGTA treatments induce a prominent clustering of R-CRT (Fig. 3A, e and h), whereas for total CRT only a small condensation in the perinuclear zone is seen (Fig. 3A, d and g). As observed in control cells, treated cells do not show colocalization of R-CRT and CRT (Fig. 3A, f, d, and i). Our results indicate that CRT arginylation occurs in living cells and that it is modulated by Ca2+ levels. The reason why we do not observe colocalization between R-CRT and CRT is considered below. Arginylated CRT Colocalizes with Stress Granules—After TG treatment of NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3A, e and h), we found that the R-CRT is sequestered into clusters similar to the punctate cytoplasmic aggregates found in stress granules (SGs) (32Kedersha N.L. Stoecklin G. Ayodele M. Yacono P. Lykke-Andersen J. Fritzler M.J. Scheuner D. Kaufman R. Golan D. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). The presence of R-CRT in SGs was investigated in NIH 3T3 cells by double immunostaining with anti-R-CRT antibody and with TIA-1 antibody, a marker of SGs (32Kedersha N.L. Stoecklin G. Ayodele M. Yacono P. Lykke-Andersen J. Fritzler M.J. Scheuner D. Kaufman R. Golan D. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar) that is specific for RNA-binding protein TIA-1. After inducing stress by treatment of cells with TG/EGTA, SG formation was detected as clusters with a robust TIA-1 staining (Fig. 4A, b). Under these experimental conditions, many TIA-1-stained granules colocalized with the labeling of R-CRT (Fig. 4A, a and c). In non-treated cells, SG formation was not induced and no colocalization of R-CRT with TIA-1 was observed, with both proteins presenting a diffuse labeling (Fig. 4B, d–f). Strikingly, in immunofluorescence assays an anti-CRT mAb (1:2500) (Fig. 3A) did not recognize the R-CRT even when used at higher concentration (1:50) (not shown). This antibody recognizes an epitope localized in the C-terminal domain of CRT whereas the arginylated epitope is localized in the N terminus. In consequence, it is speculated that in SGs, the C-terminal epitope of CRT is probably not accessible to the antibody CRT mAb due to steric hindrance. To support this hypothesis we performed double immunofluorescence in TG/EGTA-treated (Fig. 4C) and not treated (Fig. 4D) NIH 3T3 cells using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the entire human CRT and TIA-1 antibody as an SG marker. In addition to the classical ER immunostaining of CRT that does not colocalize with TIA-1, we observed in TG/EGTA-treated cells partial colocalization between CRT and TIA-1 (Fig. 4C, i) similar to that observed between R-CRT and TIA-1 (Fig. 4A, c), indicating the presence of CRT in SGs. In non-treated cells (Fig. 4D, i) no colocalization between CRT and TIA 1 was detected. Double immunofluorescence between R-CRT and total CRT with this polyclonal antibody could not be performed because both antibodies were raised in rabbit. Co-immunoprecipitation assays to examine the interaction between R-CRT and TIA-1 after TG/EGTA treatment were also performed. Once SG formation was induced, cell lysate from NIH 3T3 cells was subjected to immunoprecipitation with TIA-1 antibody followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-R-CRT pAb. Among the proteins immunoprecipitated by the TIA-1 antibody, R-CRT was immunodetected with anti-R-CRT pAb (Fig. 5B, right lane). Immunoprecipitated proteins were also examined by Western blot using the TIA-1 antibody, which recognized a single band of 40 kDa (Fig. 5A, right lane). A similar analysis was performed under control conditions (unstressed cells), in which only trace amounts of R-CRT were detected among the proteins immunoprecipitated with TIA-1 antibody (Fig. 5B, left lane). Taken altogether, our results indicate that (a) arginylation of CRT occurs in cultured cells, (b) CRT arginylation is affected by calcium levels, and (c) R-CRT is localized mainly in the SGs under stress conditions. Studies in a variety of tissues indicate the existence of several proteins that can be in vitro modified by post-translational arginylation (1Kaji H. Novelli G.D. Kaji A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 76: 474-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hallak M.E. Bongiovanni G. Barra H.S. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 33Bohley P. Kopitz J. Adam G. Rist B. von Appen F. Urban S. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 343-346PubMed Google Scholar); nevertheless, physiological substrates of arginylation had remained elusive until very recently. Indeed, only few proteins whose arginylation takes place in vivo had been identified: the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (34Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), RGS proteins (35Lee M.J. Tasaki T. Moroi K. An J.Y. Kimura S. Davyd"

Endeavoring to identify the mechanism of antimalarial action of this molecule, we examined its effect on Plasmodium falciparum protein synthesis, polyamine biosynthesis, and transport. 15-Deoxyspergualin stalled protein synthesis in P. falciparum through Hsp70 sequestration and subsequent phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2α. However, protein synthesis inhibition as well as polyamine depletion were invoked only by high micromolar concentrations of 15-deoxyspergualin, in contrast to the submicromolar concentrations sufficient to inhibit parasite growth. Further investigations demonstrated that 15-deoxyspergualin in the malaria parasite primarily targets the hitherto underexplored process of trafficking of nucleus-encoded proteins to the apicoplast. Our finding that 15-deoxyspergualin kills the malaria parasite by interfering with targeting of nucleus-encoded proteins to the apicoplast not only exposes a chink in the armor of the malaria parasite, but also reveals new realms in our endeavors to study this intriguing biological process. 15-Deoxyspergualin, an immunosuppressant with tumoricidal and antimalarial properties, has been implicated in the inhibition of a diverse array of cellular processes including polyamine synthesis and protein synthesis.

(Fig. 1), an analog of spergualin isolated from the culture broth of Bacillus laterosporus, inhibits the growth of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, in vitro and in vivo, presumably by depleting its polyamine reserves (1Midorikawa Y. Haque Q.M. Nakazawa S. Chemotherapy. 1998; 44: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 2Midorikawa Y. Haque Q.M. Chemotherapy. 1997; 43: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, other known inhibitors of polyamine biosynthesis, methylglyoxal-bis-(guanylhydrazone) analog (MGBCP), irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT11), and α-difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO) are known to be incapable of suppressing malaria in infected mice (2Midorikawa Y. Haque Q.M. Chemotherapy. 1997; 43: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This led us to question the speculated mechanism of antimalarial action of DSG.Despite the uncertainty in the actual mechanism of action of DSG, DSG is known to bind cellular chaperones, Hsp70 and Hsp90, potently, via their regulatory C-terminal motif EEVD (3Nadler S.G. Dischino D.D. Malacko A.R. Cleaveland J.S. Fujihara S.M. Marquardt H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4Nadler S.G. Tepper M.A. Schacter B. Mazucco C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 484-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). DSG does not inhibit their chaperone activity (3Nadler S.G. Dischino D.D. Malacko A.R. Cleaveland J.S. Fujihara S.M. Marquardt H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4Nadler S.G. Tepper M.A. Schacter B. Mazucco C.E.

However, it selectively enhances the ATPase activity of heat shock proteins that have the C-terminal EEVD motif, and this could be the basis of a specific modulation of the function of proteins that bind the EEVD motif of heat shock proteins (5Ramya T.N. Surolia N. Surolia A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).One of the cellular milieus in which heat shock proteins are speculated to be involved is translational regulation. Translation of an mRNA requires the formation of a ternary complex of the methionyl-tRNA, the mRNA and the 40 S subunit of the ribosome, a feat achieved through the intervention of the GTP-bound form of the initiation factor eIF2 (6Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2α at Ser51 blocks protein synthesis by preventing eIF2 recycling and depleting the cell of its pool of eIF2-GTP required for translation initiation (7Matts R.L. Levin D.H. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2559-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Several conditions of cellular stress trigger the phosphorylation of eIF2α via the activation of four different eIF2α kinases: PERK (PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum-associated kinase), GCN-2 (general control non-derepressing kinase 2), PKR (double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase), and HRI (heme-regulated inhibitor or heme-regulated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase) (8Price N.T. Welsh G.I. Proud G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The heme-regulated eIF2α kinase, HRI, is normally maintained in an inactive, unphosphorylated form by association with Hsp70 (9Thulasiraman V. Xu Z. Uma S. Gu Y. Chen J.-J. Matts R.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 552-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and we recently demonstrated that sequestration of heat shock proteins by DSG in mammalian cells leads to protein synthesis inhibition and cell death through autophosphorylation of HRI and subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2α (10Ramya T.N. Surolia N. Surolia A. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).A heme-regulated eIF2α kinase akin to the mammalian HRI is known to exist in Plasmodium falciparum, and Surolia and Padmanaban have earlier demonstrated that the autophosphorylation of this eIF2α kinase and the subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2α in P. falciparum can bring about protein synthesis inhibition and parasite death (11Surolia N. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4786-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Mohrle J.J. Zhao Y. Wernli B. Franklin R.M. Kappes B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to elucidate the cascade of events involved in protein synthesis initiation with respect to eIF2α in P. falciparum on addition of DSG. However, DSG did not bring about either protein synthesis inhibition or polyamine depletion at the submicromolar concentrations at which it was effective as an antimalarial agent. Our investigations directed us to another, and in retrospect, a far more exciting process, viz the disruption of the trafficking of nuclear-encoded apicoplast-targeted (NEAT) proteins to the apicoplast by this molecule, which we describe here.Plasmodium and other members of the protozoan group Apicomplexa are characterized by the presence of a four-membrane relict plastid, the apicoplast acquired by secondary endosymbiosis (13McFadden G.I.

Though the 35-kb apicoplast genome encodes almost exclusively only for genes involved in its translation, bioinformatic methods and experiments using fluorescent fusion proteins have demonstrated that the meager apicoplast proteome is supplemented with ∼550 nucleus-encoded proteins that are targeted to the apicoplast (16Zuegge J.

These NEAT proteins include enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis, heme synthesis, and isoprenoid synthesis (19Surolia N. Surolia A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar); metabolic processes which are apicoplast-resident (19Surolia N. Surolia A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 20Sato S. Wilson R.J. Curr. Genet. 2002; 40: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Surolia N. Padmanaban G. Biochem.

Science. 1999; 285: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) and which, because of their prokaryotic nature, are incidentally our best bet while designing antimalarial agents. The N termini of NEAT proteins have an N-terminal bipartite plastid targeting sequence (PTS) comprising a classic signal peptide with a hydrophobic domain that directs cotranslational insertion into the endomembrane system (including ER), and a 24–100-amino acid long transit peptide harboring Hsp70 binding sites and highly enriched in lysine and asparagine residues that sort proteins for apicoplast targeting within the secretory system (17Foth B.J.

McFadden G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar).In situ experiments in the malaria parasite using PTS-GFP fusion proteins are compliant with a protein trafficking model, wherein all proteins entering the endomembrane system are cleaved of their signal peptide and bundled into endomembrane-derived vesicles, which subsequently dock at the apicoplast (17Foth B.J. Ralph S.J. Tonkin C.J. Struck N.S. Fraunholz M. Roos D.S. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Science. 2003; 299: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Only proteins bearing transit peptides, which are maintained in an unfolded conformation by bound Hsp70 molecules (17Foth B.J. Ralph S.J. Tonkin C.J. Struck N.S. Fraunholz M. Roos D.S. Cowman A.F.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 6239-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), are expected to be diverted into the apicoplast, probably through interaction with a duplicated set of Toc proteins in the second outermost membrane. The remaining proteins are thought to be packaged into vesicles that bud from the outer membrane of the apicoplast for transport to further destinations in the secretory pathway, culminating in secretion into the parasitophorous vacuole. Toc and Tic complexes are believed to mediate protein import across the two innermost membranes of the apicoplast in an ATP-dependent fashion (25van Dooren G.G. Schwartzbach S.D. Osafune T. McFadden G.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Following protein import, the transit peptide is cleaved by a stromal processing peptidase homologue in the apicoplast (26van Dooren G.G. Su V. D'Ombrain M.C. McFadden G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23612-23619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), so that following its targeting to the apicoplast, the processed NEAT protein is of lower molecular mass than the preprocessed form.The apicoplast is essential to parasite survival (27Fichera M.E. Roos D.S. Nature. 1997; 390: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), and its elimination by pharmacological or molecular genetic manipulation has been demonstrated to evoke distinctive delayed death kinetics, an intriguing biological phenomenon characterized by normal parasite growth in the host cell immediately following apicoplast perturbation, but parasite death subsequent to the invasion of a new host cell (28He C.Y. Shaw M.K. Pletcher C.H. Striepen B. Tilney L.G. Roos D.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G. Striepen B. Handman E.

This phenomenon has been rationalized as the consequence of the generation of daughter cells devoid of apicoplast following missegregation of the apicoplast because of inhibition of an apicoplast function (28He C.Y. Shaw M.K. Pletcher C.H. Striepen B. Tilney L.G. Roos D.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Various groups have, in the last decade, assiduously investigated several apicoplast processes and their inhibition by specific molecules. However, the process of trafficking of NEAT proteins to the apicoplast has been hitherto unexplored as a drug target in the malaria parasite, and details of the trafficking process are yet to be worked out completely. Our somewhat serendipitous finding that a widely used small molecule, 15-deoxyspergualin, kills the malaria parasite by disrupting targeting of NEAT proteins to the apicoplast, provides new opportunities to study this interesting biological process as well as opens up possibilities of developing inhibitors of this process as antimalarial agents.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—15-Deoxyspergualin was a kind gift from Nippon Kayaku Co., Tokyo, Japan. Anti-actin antibody was from Sigma; anti-Hsp70 monoclonal antibody and polyclonal antibodies to eIF2α and Ser-phosphorylated eIF2α were from Cell Signaling. We raised antibodies to purified recombinant proteins PfTufA and PfFabG. The radioisotopes, [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine labeling mix, [32P]ATP, [3H]hypoxanthine, [3H]spermidine, and [14C]acetate were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 1,4-[14C]Putrescine and [3H]putrescine were from Amersham Biosciences. The peptide EEVD was custom-synthesized from Genscript. Triclosan 5000 was obtained from Kumar Organic Products Ltd., Bangalore, India. MitoTracker Red CM-H2Xros as well as Alexa fluor 488 and Alexa fluor 568 were purchased from Molecular Probes and DAPI from Sigma.Intraerythrocytic P. falciparum Cultures—The FCK2 parasite strain was cultured in O+ human red blood cells in RPMI medium supplemented with human serum by the candle jar method of Trager and Jenson (30Trager W. Jenson J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6077) Google Scholar). Cultures were synchronized by 5% sorbitol treatment (31Lambros C. Vanderberg J. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2793) Google Scholar), and parasites were observed for viability and changes in morphology by standard Giemsa staining.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Heat Shock Proteins—Parasite heat shock proteins PfHsp70-1 (an Hsp70 protein with a C-terminal EEVD motif: PlasmodB PF08_0054) and PfHsp70-2 (an Hsp70 protein without the EEVD motif: PlasmodB PF11_0351) were cloned, overexpressed, and the recombinant proteins characterized as previously (5Ramya T.N. Surolia N. Surolia A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).In Vitro Phosphorylation of Proteins in Parasite Lysate—Parasites were released from the red blood cells by 0.15% saponin. Free parasites were lysed with four volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (100 mm KCl/7 mm Mg(OAc)2/380 mm sucrose/6.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol/50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4/0.14% Triton X-100/15 μm leupeptin). The suspension was then subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was used for the phosphorylation reaction. The phosphorylation status of proteins was examined by following a previously reported protocol (10Ramya T.N. Surolia N. Surolia A. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was carried out in 25 μl containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, [γ-32P]ATP (25 μCi, 3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), 0.1 mm GTP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 45 units of creatine phosphokinase per ml, 0.5 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 7 mm Mg(0Ac)2, 110 mm KAc, 0.375 mm spermidine, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg wheat germ tRNA, and 40 μm each of the 20 amino acids. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 5 min before [γ-32P]ATP addition and was terminated after 2–3 min by the addition of freshly prepared reducing buffer with SDS. The samples were analyzed on polyacrylamide gels and subjected to Western analysis with specific antibodies and autoradiography. To examine the effect of heat shock proteins on phosphorylation, purified and concentrated recombinant heat shock protein (50 μl of a 50 μm solution) was incubated with or without DSG (added to a final concentration of 50 μm) on ice, the solution was subjected to centrifugation through a protein-concentrating device (MWCO 10 kDa Centricon), the filtrate was lyophilized to a convenient small volume (2.5 μl), and added to the in vitro phosphorylation assay (25 μl), so that the effective concentration of DSG or heat shock proteins would be 100 μm. With heat shock proteins incubated in the presence of DSG, the concentration of DSG in the phosphorylation reaction would be lowered because of its sequestration by the heat shock proteins and hence its inability to pass through the protein concentrating device. The peptide EEVD, like DSG, was added to a final concentration of 100 μm in the phosphorylation reaction.Metabolic Labeling of Parasite Proteins in Situ—Synchronized parasites (∼10% parasitemia) pretreated with varying concentrations of DSG for 3 h were incubated with [35S]methionine (specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol, added to a final concentration of 180 μCi/ml of culture) for 3 h. The parasites were then released by saponin lysis, lysed in hypotonic buffer, and subjected to analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography or spotted on to Whatman 3 filter discs presoaked in 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with hot and then cold trichloroacetic acid, and the radioactivity measured in a liquid scintillation counter (11Surolia N. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4786-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Polyamine Biosynthesis in the Malaria Parasite—Polyamine synthesis in the malaria parasite was monitored by the autoradiography of TLC resolved dansylated polyamines following the metabolic labeling of the parasite polyamines using [14C]putrescine (107 mCi/mmol) (see Ref. 32Ramya T.N. Surolia N. Surolia A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (∼10 ml) synchronized with 5% sorbitol were incubated with [14C]putrescine (50 μCi; 100 mCi/mmol) to a final concentration of 0.2 mm for 6 h. They were then washed and resuspended in RPMI without [14C]putrescine for 18 h. The parasites were then isolated from the red blood cells by saponin lysis, and the polyamines in the parasites dansylated by the procedure that follows. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5% trichloroacetic acid to precipitate proteins. The pH of the supernatant was brought to ∼9 with saturated sodium carbonate, and then an equal volume of 10 mg/ml dansyl chloride in acetone was added to it. The reaction mix was vortexed and allowed to incubate in the dark at 60 °C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped with 100 mg/ml of l-alanine, the acetone was evaporated, the reaction mix cooled to 4 °C, and dansylated polyamines extracted with an equal volume of toluene. The upper toluene phase was transferred to a fresh tube, concentrated to ∼50 μl, and spotted on a Whatman silica gel 60 TLC plate along with standard dansylated polyamines (also prepared in a similar fashion). The dansylated polyamines were developed with hexane/ethyl acetate:: 6:4 (see Ref. 33Amorim H.V. Basso L.C. Crocomo O.J. Teixeira A.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1977; 25: 957-958Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and visualized under UV illumination. The identification of the polyamines was also confirmed by comigration of the dansylated polyamines with the dansylated standards in a different solvent system (chloroform:triethylamine::5:1) previously reported by Bhatnagar et al. (34Hbatnagar P. Clasheen B.M. Bains S.K. Long S.L. Minocha R. Walter C. Minocha S.C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 2139-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Similar separation was obtained with this system also (data not shown).Effect of DSG on Hypusination of PfeIF5A—Polyamines in P. falciparum-infected red blood cells were labeled with [14C]putrescine as mentioned earlier, the proteins precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. eIF5A, the only known protein with a post-translational modification derived from a polyamine, was the only radiolabeled band on the autoradiogram and was identified by its molecular size.Polyamine Transport in Red Blood Cells—Putrescine/spermidine transport into uninfected or infected red blood cells was assayed by a previously reported protocol (32Ramya T.N. Surolia N. Surolia A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, 900 μl of uninfected or P. falciparum-infected red blood cells (3 × 107 cells) were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline with 100 μl of 25 μCi/ml [3H]putrescine (26 Ci/mmol), 14C-putrescine (107 mCi/mmol), or [3H]spermidine (22.5 Ci/mmol) at 37 °C. Transport was terminated at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min time points by rapidly separating the parasites from the other assay components of a 150-μl aliquot by centrifugation through 800 μl of dibutyl phthalate (specific gravity 1.04). The upper aqueous layer was discarded, the oil layer washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and removed, and the red blood cell pellet lysed with water. The proteins in the lysate were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and the supernatant blotted on to Whatman 3 filters. The filters were dried and placed in scintillation fluid, and the radioactivity counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Hewlett-Packard).Inhibition of Parasite Growth by DSG—[3H]Hypoxanthine uptake by parasites was used to assess their sensitivity to DSG (see Ref. 35Desjardins R.E. Canfield C.J. Haynes J.D. Chulay J.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1979; 16: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). Briefly, synchronized parasites were cultured in 96-well plates (Nunc, Copenhagen, Denmark) at 2–3% hematocrit and at an initial parasitemia of 1–2%, with varying concentrations of DSG, and addition of DSG in fresh medium every 24 h for 48 h. To follow death kinetics, parasites synchronized at the ring stage were either cultured in the presence of [3H]hypoxanthine and varying concentrations of DSG for 48 h and harvested, or cultured in the presence of varying concentrations of DSG for the first 48 h and then incubated with [3H]hypoxanthine for the next 48 h and harvested. Parasites were harvested with a Nunc cell harvester (Nunc) and the radioactivity counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Parasites were also observed microscopically in Giemsa-stained blood smears.Quantitative Competitive PCR to Quantify Apicoplast: Nuclear DNA Ratio in DSG-treated Parasites—Using quantitative competitive PCR (36Gilliland G. Perrin S. Blanchard K. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Surolia A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Incorporation of [14C]Acetate into Fatty Acids of Parasites— Red blood cells infected with the malaria parasite (in the asexual stage of interest, ∼10% parasitemia), 25 ml, treated with triclosan (10 μm) or 15-deoxyspergualin (1 μm) were resuspended in 5 ml of complete medium while retaining the same concentration of the inhibitor. 1,2[14C]Acetate (50 μCi/ml sodium acetate; 60 mCi/mmol) was added, and the incorporation of [14C]acetate into fatty acids measured (19Surolia N. Surolia A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar).Determination of Levels of Apicoplast Proteins in DSG-treated Parasites—Synchronized infected red blood cells, untreated or pretreated with various concentrations of DSG for 3 h were labeled in situ with [35S]methionine (180 μCi/ml culture) for 3 h. Saponin-released parasites were lysed in hypotonic buffer (1 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Levels of actin, PfTufA, and PfFabG were examined by Western analysis and autoradiography.Pulse-Chase and Immunoprecipitation of Native PfFabG— Synchronized ring stage parasite cultures (18 ml, ∼10% parasitemia) were untreated or treated with 500 nm clindamycin or 1 μm DSG for 24, 48, or 72 h. The cultures were then washed with methionine-free RPMI twice, each suspended in 3-ml volume, and labeled in situ with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine mix (300 μCi/ml of culture) for 1 h, after which the label was removed by extensive washes with complete RPMI. Parasites (from 1 ml of resuspended culture each) were harvested at 0, 2, and 4 h, and released from the erythrocytes by saponin lysis. The lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FabG or anti-TufA antibodies. Briefly, the parasites were lysed in i.e. cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 15 μm leupeptin) on ice for 30 min. Following centrifugation at 15,000 × g, the supernatant was precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysate was then incubated with 5 μg of anti-FabG or anti-TufA antibody and protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose beads were then washed twice with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100, once with buffer containing 3 mm bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 200 mm NaCl and once with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4 and 150 mm NaCl. The immunoprecipitates were then eluted by resuspending the beads in nonreducing SDS lysis buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Immunofluorescence—Synchronized parasite cultures were untreated or treated with 500 nm clindamycin or 1 μm DSG for 24, 48, or 72 h. They were then processed for immunofluorescence of native PfFabG and PfTufA following the protocol reported by Tonkin et al. (39Tonkin C.J. van Dooren G.G. Spurck T.P. Struck N.S. Good R.T. Handman E. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 137: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was carried out with rabbit anti-PfFabG antibody conjugated with Alexa fluor 488 and rabbit anti-PfTufA antibody conjugated with Alexa fluor 568. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. The various asexual stages were identified as follows. A parasite with a single nucleus and no hemozoin was considered a ring (0–24 h of the asexual cycle), a parasite with a nucleus and hemozoin was considered a trophozoite (24–36 h of the asexual cycle), and a parasites with multiple nuclei and hemozoin was considered a schizont (36–48 h of the asexual cycle) Images were captured using confocal microscopy and overlay images obtained using Adobe Photoshop 6.0.RESULTSEffect of DSG on Parasite Protein Synthesis—DSG abrogated protein synthesis in malaria parasites with an IC50 of 443 μm, as assessed by in situ incorporation of [35S]methionine into parasite proteins (Fig. 2A). DSG, like chloroquine and heme deficiency (11Surolia N. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2057330297,"We examined the role of class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in the regulation of activation of NADPH oxidase in PMNs and the mechanism of PMN-dependent lung inflammation and microvessel injury induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. TNF-α stimulation of PMNs resulted in superoxide production that was dependent on CD11b/CD18-mediated PMN adhesion. Additionally, TNF-α induced the association of CD11b/CD18 with the NADPH oxidase subunit Nox2 (gp91phox) and phosphorylation of p47phox, indicating the CD11b/CD18 dependence of NADPH oxidase activation. Transduction of wild-type PMNs with Δp85 protein, a dominant-negative form of the class IA PI3K regulatory subunit, p85α, fused to HIV-TAT (TAT-Δp85) prevented (i) CD11b/CD18-dependent PMN adhesion, (ii) interaction of CD11b/CD18 with Nox2 and phosphorylation of p47phox, and (iii) PMN oxidant production. Furthermore, studies in mice showed that i.v. infusion of TAT-Δp85 significantly reduced the recruitment of PMNs in lungs and increase in lung microvascular permeability induced by TNF-α. We conclude that class IA PI3K serves as a nodal point regulating CD11b/CD18-integrin-dependent PMN adhesion and activation of NADPH oxidase, and leads to oxidant production at sites of PMN adhesion, and the resultant lung microvascular injury in mice.

Superoxide anion (O2−˙) is formed from molecular oxygen (O2) through the enzymatic activity of the NADPH oxidase complex (1Babior B.M. Am. J. Med. 2000; 109: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). O2−˙ gives rise to H2O2, spontaneously or via superoxide dismutase, and to hypochlorous acid (HOCl) via myeloperoxidase, the PMN primary granule protein. However, excessive production of ROS by PMNs adherent to endothelial cells can also cause microvascular injury and tissue inflammation (2Gao X.P. Standiford T.J. Rahman A. Newstead M. Holland S.M.

Biol. 1994; 56: 672-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α is known to induce the production of ROS by surface-adherent PMNs (4Dapino P. Dallegri F. Ottonello L. Sacchetti C. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1993; 94: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The dependence of TNF-α-induced ROS production on PMN adherence to surfaces such as fibrinogen or endothelial cells involves the activation of β2 integrin, CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1, αMβ2, CR3) (5Serrander L.

The molecular basis for the cross-talk between CD11b/CD18 and TNF-α receptors that regulate NADPH oxidase activation in PMNs is poorly understood. TNF-α interacts with two receptors, 60 and 80 kDa (7Korchak H.M. Kilpatrick L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 8Smith C.A. Farrah T.

Immunol. 1995; 154: 4142-4149PubMed Google Scholar). TNF-α-activated signaling pathway in PMNs involves protein tyrosine phosphorylation, principally via tyrosine kinases of the Src family and Syk (10Laudanna C. Rossi F. Berton G. Biochem. Biophys.

However, TNF-α was shown to activate tyrosine phosphorylation only in adherent cells and required the interaction of TNF receptors with β2 integrins by as yet undefined mechanisms (7Korchak H.M.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) induces the generation of the lipid second messenger, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) by phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate at the 3D position of the inositol ring (12Wymann M.P.

Class IA PI3K family members, which are activated by tyrosine kinases, consist of a heterodimer composed of a 110-kDa (p110 α, β, δ) catalytic subunit and an adaptor/regulatory subunit (p85α, p85β, p55α, p55γ, p50α) (13Dhand R.

In contrast, Class IB enzymes contain the unique catalytic subunit (p110γ) associated with the regulatory subunit p101, and signal downstream of heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors (15Stoyanov B.

However, the function of individual PI3K isoforms in PMNs has not been well established primarily because of the lack of isoform-selective and cell membrane-permeable reagents necessary for PMN studies. NADPH oxidase is an electron transport system that transfers reducing equivalents from NADPH to O2, resulting in the production of O2−˙ (18Babior B.M.

NADPH oxidase in phagocytic cells consists of a membrane-integrated cytochrome b558, composed of two subunits (Nox2 (gp91phox) and p22phox) and three cytosolic proteins (p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2). NADPH oxidase exists in an unassembled state in resting cells, but upon stimulation, p47phox, p67phox, and Rac 2 translocate to the plasma membrane where they co-operatively form a complex with cytochrome b558; however, the signaling mechanism regulating NADPH oxidase assembly in adherent PMNs and consequences of adhesion-dependent PMN activation in mediating vascular inflammation remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we transduced PMNs with Δp85 protein, a dominant negative form (Δ478–513 amino acids, p110 binding site) (23Myou S. Leff A.R. Myo S. Boetticher E. Tong J. Meliton A.Y. Liu J. Munoz N.M. Zhu X. J. Exp.

Our findings demonstrate that class IA PI3K activation is required for CD11b/CD18-dependent PMN adhesion, adhesion-dependent phosphorylation of p47phox, and ROS production by PMNs. In studies in mice, i.v. infusion of TAT-Δp85 protein prevented PMN-dependent lung microvascular injury and inflammation induced by TNF-α. Thus, selective inhibitors of class IA PI3K represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treating lung inflammation and injury resulting from the inappropriate sequestration and adhesion-dependent activation of PMNs in microvessels.

Purification of TAT fusion proteins was performed using modification of a method from Myou et al. (28Myou S. Leff A.R. Myo S. Boetticher E. Meliton A.Y. Lambertino A.T. Liu J. Xu C. Munoz N.M. Zhu X. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4399-4405Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, TAT-Δp85 was purified by sonication of high expressing BL21 Escherichia coli in 10 ml of buffer that was 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0 and 100 mm NaCl. Cellular lysates were resolved by centrifugation, loaded onto 5-ml Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column, washed, and eluted with 0.25–1.0 m imidazole in PBS. Imidazole was removed from the resultant protein solution using a PD-10 column. Each fusion protein preparation was flash-frozen at –80 °C. PMN Adhesion to Immobilized Fibrinogen—For PMN adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen, 96-well microplates were coated with 10 μg/ml of fibrinogen overnight at 4 °C and washed three times with HBSS before use. Mouse PMNs loaded with calcein-AM (2 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C were added to fibrinogen-coated plates. The assay for PMN adhesion was performed as described by us (25Gao X.P. Liu Q. Broman M. Predescu D. Frey R.S. Malik A.B. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 21: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Microscopy of PMN Adhesion—Freshly isolated PMNs (2 × 106), added to 8-well Lab-Tek II chamber slide with fibrinogen-coated surface (10 μg/ml, for 60 min at 37 °C), were challenged with TNF-α at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then fixed with 3.3% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and washed. Photomicrographs of PMNs in contact with surface-coated fibrinogen were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. PMN Superoxide Generation—PMNs without or with the treatment of TNF-α at 5 × 106 cells/ml were seeded into a white, 96-well, flat-bottom tissue culture dish (E&K Scientific) coated with fibrinogen overnight. O2−˙ generation by PMNs was measured as described, using isoluminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (30Lin P. Welch E.J. Gao X.P. Malik A.B. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2981-2989Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, isoluminol was added to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 50 μm, and horseradish peroxidase was added to a final concentration of 40 units/ml. O2−˙ production was determined after cells were stimulated with TNF-α for the indicated times, following preincubation with or without anti-CD11b mAb (8 μg/ml, clone M1/70, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), isotype-matched control antibodies (8 μg/ml, rat IgG2b, BD Biosciences) for anti-CD11b mAb, TAT-Δp85 (300 nm), TAT-GFP (300 nm), or LY294002 (50 μm, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) 15 min prior to TNF-α stimulation. The relative concentration of O2−˙ in the culture medium was expressed as counts per second. Polyacrylamide Electrophoresis—The BCA method (31Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar) was used to measure total protein concentration. Equal amounts of total protein were loaded per lane (specific amounts are given in figure legends). Cells were lysed in the following buffer: 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) to which a protease inhibitor mixture (AEBSF, pepstatin A, E-64, bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) was added before each experiment (Sigma). We used pre-cast NuPAGE Bis-Tris (4–12%) gels purchased from Invitrogen, per the manufacturer’s protocol. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Activation of Akt was assessed using a 1:500 dilution of an antibody that recognizes Akt phosphorylated on Ser473 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). An antibody against non-phosphorylated Akt (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) was used to assess protein loading. Association of CD11b/CD18 with the NADPH oxidase subunit Nox2 was studied using a soluble enriched membrane fraction. After homogenization of the lungs in PBS (containing 1% protease inhibitors), the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g. The pellets were sonicated 2×12 s in lysis buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, to which a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added. After centrifugation again for 15 min at 14,000 × g, the supernatants of enriched membrane fraction were collected for immunoprecipitation. Equal amounts of protein (200 μg/ml total protein) in supernatants were precleared using purified IgG followed by protein A-Sepharose beads. The precleared supernatants were recovered by centrifugation, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary Abs (3 μgml–1) (antibody against CD11b, purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), followed by incubations with protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min using an Eppendorf refrigerated microcentrifuge at 4 °C), washed extensively (5 × 10 min), solubilized and run on 4–20% SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the membrane was then incubated with 1:500 anti-Nox2 (BD Biosciences) or anti-CD11b antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing, horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were then used to probe the membranes. The membranes were developed by manufacturer’s instructions. For analysis of total p47phox phosphorylation, lungs and cells were homogenized in PBS containing 1% protease inhibitors, centrifuged at 14,000 × g, and the pellet was sonicated in lysis buffer, as described above. Total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with p47phox antibody (from B. Babior and S. Catz, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein gel stain (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (32Frey R.S. Gao X. Javaid K. Siddiqui S.S. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16128-16138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The gels were scanned with Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad) and images of phosphoproteins were obtained. Non-phospho p47phox loading of gels was obtained by Western blotting of total cell lysates. TNF-α Challenge of Mice—Mice were challenged with TNF-α (100 μg/kg, intraperitoneal). This dosage did not result in death within the 6-h experimental period after challenge. Control mice were injected intraperitoneal with an equal volume of PBS. Lungs were obtained at select time points after TNF-α challenge. One hour was used to assess the phosphorylation of Akt, p47phox in lungs, leukocyte oxidative burst, lung PMN recruitment, and lung vascular permeability and edema formation. To determine the role of PI3K in acute lung injury, mice were first injected intraperitoneal with LY294002 (100 mg/kg of body weight, 100 μl) or wortmannin (2 mg/kg of body weight, 100 μl). In another group, animals receive i.v. TAT-Δp85 (10 mg/kg) or a control injection via tail vein. The animals receiving injection of TAT-Δp85 or control proteins (His-Δp85 or TAT-GFP) were assigned randomly to the experimental groups consisting of six mice each. In preliminary studies, we demonstrated that TAT protein vector (administered as TAT-GFP) had no effect on TNF-α-induced lung vascular permeability versus saline buffer control. The lungs obtained at different time points after TNF-α challenge were used to assess the changes as described above. ROS Production by BAL Leukocytes—ROS in leukocytes obtained from mouse broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was measured as described (33Kitagawa Y. Van Eeden S.F. Redenbach D.M. Daya M. Walker B.A. Klut M.E. Wiggs B.R. Hogg J.C. J. Appl. Physiol. 1997; 82: 1397-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, leukocytes from BAL fluid were collected with or without intraperitoneal TNF-α challenge and incubated for 15 min with ROS-sensitive dye dichlorofluorescin-diacetate (DCFH-DA, 10 μm, Molecular Probes) at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered solution (PBS, Sigma Aldrich). After 1× wash, the cells were suspended in PBS, and kept on ice until FACS analysis on the same day. The samples were analyzed by measuring fluorescence of 15,000–20,000 events from the gated PMN population using a Coulter EPICS Elite ESP (Coulter Corporation, Miami, FL) with the laser at 530 nm. The fluorescent product of oxidation (DCFH) was measured by flow cytometry using four decade logarithmic amplification. Lung PMN Sequestration—Sequestration of PMNs in lung tissue was assessed by determining myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lungs and by morphometrically quantifying PMN infiltration as described (2Gao X.P. Standiford T.J. Rahman A. Newstead M. Holland S.M. Dinauer M.C. Liu Q.H. Malik A.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3974-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 27Gao X. Xu N. Sekosan M. Mehta D. Ma S.Y. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2895-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Pulmonary Microvascular Permeability and Edema Formation—Kf,c was measured to determine pulmonary microvascular permeability to liquid and the rate of edema formation was continuously monitored by determining lung wet weight changes as described (25Gao X.P. Liu Q. Broman M. Predescu D. Frey R.S. Malik A.B. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 21: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Gao X. Xu N. Sekosan M. Mehta D. Ma S.Y. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2895-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the 2-way analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Effectiveness of TAT-Δp85 in Preventing PI3K Activation Caused by TNF-α in PMNs—We have shown that the synthesized TAT-Δp85 fusion protein (useful for transducing human eosinophils (23Myou S. Leff A.R. Myo S. Boetticher E. Tong J. Meliton A.Y. Liu J. Munoz N.M. Zhu X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar)) specifically inhibits the activity of class IA PI3K. Experiments showed that all PMNs were transduced with TAT fusion protein after 2 min (data not shown). Western blot analysis showed that TAT-Δp85 was also successfully transduced into mouse PMNs. TAT-Δp85 expression was observed with little overlap with endogenous p85 after incubation of PMNs with 100–300 nm TAT-Δp85 (Fig. 1A, top panel). The functional efficacy of TAT-Δp85 expression was assessed by its ability to inhibit phosphorylation of Akt, downstream target of PI3K. As shown in Fig. 1A (middle panel), the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of Akt was inhibited by TAT-Δp85 in a concentration-dependent manner. The effectiveness of TAT-Δp85 (300 nm) was similar to the nonspecific PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (50 μm) used as a positive control (Fig. 1B). TAT-GFP (used as a control) had no effect on Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Inhibition of Class IA PI3K Reduces PMN Adhesion to Immobilized Fibrinogen—We initially determined the role of the β2 integrin CD11b/CD18 in mediating PMN firm adhesion to purified fibrinogen, a CD11b/CD18 ligand, induced by TNF-α (Fig. 2, A and B). PI3K inhibition by 300 nm TAT-Δp85 or 50 μm Ly294002 prevented PMN adhesion to fibrinogen induced by TNF-α. Control peptide (TAT-GFP and TAT-p85) had no effect on PMN adhesion to fibrinogen induced by TNF-α. PMN adhesion was also prevented by preincubation with anti-CD11b mAb (Fig. 2A). Combination of TAT-Δp85 and anti-CD11b mAb did not further reduce adhesion of PMNs to the plated fibrinogen (Fig. 2A). To address definitively the role of CD11b/CD18 in mediating PMN firm adhesion in this system, PMNs isolated from mice either overexpressing the selective CD11b antagonist (34Barnard J.W. Biro M.G. Lo S.K. Ohno S. Carozza M.A. Moyle M. Soule H.R. Malik A.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4876-4881PubMed Google Scholar) NIF (NIF+/+) or lacking CD11b (Mac-1–/–) were used for the adhesion assay. Compared with PMNs isolated from WT mice, we observed a decrease in adhesion to fibrinogen using the NIF+/+ PMNs. Pretreatment of NIF+/+ PMNs with TAT-Δp85 did not further reduce PMN firm adhesion to fibrinogen (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained using Mac-1–/– PMNs. As shown in Fig. 2C, TNF-α caused PMN spreading onto fibrinogen-coated surface (Fig. 2C, middle) compared with untreated cells, which were round in appearance (Fig. 2C, left). The cells failed to spread when treated with TAT-Δp85 prior to TNF-α challenge (Fig. 2C, right). Inhibition of Class IA PI3K Reduces PMN Adhesion-dependent ROS Production—We also examined the role of CD11b/CD18 and class IA PI3K in mediating PMN O2−˙ release induced by TNF-α. TNF-α caused time-dependent O2−˙ release by PMNs adherent to plated fibrinogen (Fig. 3A). PI3K inhibition by 300 nm TAT-Δp85 or 50 μm Ly294002 blocked O2−˙ release caused by TNF-α. By contrast, control peptide (TAT-GFP, TAT-p85, or His-Δp85) had no effect on O2−˙ release induced by TNF-α. O2−˙ release was also prevented by preincubation with anti-CD11b antibody. Combination of TAT-Δp85 and anti-CD11b did not further reduce O2−˙ production of PMNs to plated fibrinogen. To further determine the role of CD11b/CD18 in PMN O2−˙ generation, PMNs isolated from mice knock-out of Mac-1 were used for these studies. Compared with PMNs isolated from WT mice, decreased O2−˙ release was observed in PMNs isolated from Mac-1 mice. Pretreatment Mac-1–/– PMNs with TAT-Δp85 resulted in no further reduction of O2−˙ release (Fig. 3). Because PMN activation and oxidant production are rapid signaling-dependent events (35Zhao T. Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1732-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we also determined the early time points of PMN O2−˙ release. As shown in Fig. 3B, TNF-α-induced O2−˙ release by PMNs adherent to plated fibrinogen reached maximum within 15–30 min. Pretreatment of PMNs with TAT-Δp85 significantly reduced TNF-α-induced O2−˙ release in a dose-dependant manner at early time points. Control peptide (TAT-GFP and TAT-p85) had no effect on TNF-α-induced O2−˙ release (Fig. 3B). Because class IA PI3K plays a central role in PMN chemotaxis and superoxide production by chemoattractants (36Boulven I. Levasseur S. Marois S. Pare G. Rollet-Labelle E. Naccache P.H. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 7621-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we also studied the effects of TAT-Δp85 on fMLP-induced O2−˙ release by PMN. TAT-Δp85 (100 nm and 300 nm) reduced fMLP (1 μm and 5 μm)-induced O2−˙ release in a dose- and time-dependent manner at the early time points within 30 min (data not shown). Inhibition of Class IA PI3K Reduces CD11b/CD18 Association with Nox2 and p47phox Activation—We examined whether NADPH oxidase subunits are co-localized with CD11b/CD18 on PMN membrane after activation by TNF-α. We found that CD11b/CD18 co-immunoprecipitated with Nox2 within 1 h of TNF-α challenge in PMNs. This response was attenuated by either pretreatment with anti-CD11b mAb or NIF (Fig. 4A). We addressed the role of PI3K in signaling the interaction of CD11b/CD18 with NADPH oxidase. As shown in Fig. 4B, pretreatment of WT PMNs with TAT-Δp85 reduced the association of CD11b with Nox2. We also addressed whether PI3K regulates the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of p47phox in PMNs. TNF-α induced p47phox phosphorylation at 15–30 min, and introduction of TAT-Δp85 prevented phosphorylation of p47phox (Fig. 4C). Western blotting showed that the same amount of p47phox was immunoprecipitated from each sample. Class IA PI3K Regulates Activation of NADPH Oxidase in Vivo—We examined the efficacy of TAT-Δp85 introduced in vivo in inhibiting PI3K activity in mouse lungs after systemic challenge with TNF-α. Intravenous injection of 5–10 mg/kg TAT-Δp85 or intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg of LY294002 prevented the phosphorylation of Akt in lung homogenates (Fig. 5A). TAT-GFP had no inhibitory effect on phosphorylation of Akt. Systemic administration of TAT-Δp85 also significantly reduced phosphorylation of p47phox (Fig. 5B), whereas TAT-GFP had no inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of p47phox. Because"

This suggests that the neural substrates underlying spatial cognition might be essential for remembering specific life episodes. Indeed, hippocampal lesions prevent spatial relational learning in adult rodents and monkeys, and result in profound amnesia in adult humans. In contrast, we show here that monkeys with neonatal hippocampal lesions learned new spatial relational information. Our experiments suggest that early hippocampal damage leads to functional brain reorganization that enables spatial information to be acquired through the use of brain regions that normally do not subserve this function."
https://openalex.org/W2004724971,"Human Immune Deficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) infection can induce severe and debilitating neurological problems, including behavioral abnormalities, motor dysfunction, and dementia. HIV can persistently infect astrocytes, during which viral accessory proteins are produced that are unaffected by current antiretroviral therapy. The effect of these proteins on astrocyte function remains unknown. Astrocytes are the predominant cells within the brain; thus, disruption of astrocyte function could influence the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection. To explore further these effects, we constitutively expressed HIV-Tat protein in astrocytes. Since the nuclear presence of Tat protein leads to alteration of host gene expression, we further analyzed the effects of Tat on host gene transcripts. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) was a significantly elevated transcript as verified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and it was subsequently released extracellularly in Tat-expressing and HIV-infected astrocytes. ET-1 expression was also prominent in reactive astrocytes and neurons in brain tissues from basal ganglia and frontal lobes of HIV encephalitic patients. HIV-Tat regulated ET-1 at the transcriptional level through NF-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-responsive sites in the ET-1 promoter. Intriguingly, simvastatin (10 microM) down-regulated HIV-Tat-induced ET-1 and also inhibited activation of NF-kappaB in astrocytes. Our findings suggest that ET-1 may be critical in mediating the neuropathogenesis of HIV dementia and that statins may have therapeutic potential in these patients."

https://openalex.org/W1972096487,"The unique voltage- and Ca2+-dependent K+ (BK) channel, prominently expressed in airway smooth muscle cells, has been suggested as an important effector in controlling airway contractility. Its deletion in mice depolarized resting membrane potential of tracheal cells, suggesting an increased open-probability of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. While carbachol concentration-dependently increased the tonic tension of wild-type (WT) trachea, mutant trachea showed a different response with rapid tension development followed by phasic contractions superimposed on a tonic component. Tonic contractions were substantially more dependent on L-type Ca2+ current in mutant than in WT trachea, even though L-type Ca2+ channels were not up-regulated. In the absence of L-type Ca2+ current, half-maximal contraction of trachea was shifted from 0.51 to 1.7 microM. In agreement, cholinergic bronchoconstriction was reduced in mutant lung slices, isolated-perfused lungs and, most impressively, in mutant mice analyzed by body plethysmography. Furthermore, isoprenaline-mediated airway relaxation was enhanced in mutants. In-depth analysis of cAMP and cGMP signaling revealed up-regulation of the cGMP pathway in mutant tracheal muscle. Inhibition of cGMP kinase reestablished normal sensitivity toward carbachol, indicating that up-regulation of cGMP signaling counterbalances for BK channel ablation, pointing to a predominant role of BK channel in regulation of airway tone."
https://openalex.org/W2033533608,"At axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier in neurons, the spectrin membrane skeleton plays roles in physically stabilizing the plasma membrane integrity and in clustering voltage-gated sodium channels for proper conduction of the action potential. βIV-Spectrin, an essential component of the membrane skeleton at these sites, has an N-terminal-truncated isoform, Σ6, which is expressed at much higher levels than the full-length isoform Σ1. To investigate the role of βIV-spectrin Σ6, we generated Σ1-deficient mice with a normal level of Σ6 expression (Σ1-/- mice), and compared their phenotypes with those of previously generated mice lacking both Σ1 and Σ6(Σ1Σ6-/- mice). The gross neurological defects observed in Σ1Σ6-/- mice, such as hindleg contraction, were apparently ameliorated in Σ1-/- mice. At cellular levels, Σ1Σ6-/- and Σ1-/- neurons similarly exhibited waving and swelling of the plasma membrane at axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier. By contrast, the levels of ankyrin G and voltage-gated sodium channels at these sites, which are significantly reduced in Σ1Σ6-/- mice, were substantially recovered in Σ1-/- mice. We conclude that the truncated βIV-spectrin isoform Σ6 plays a specific role in clustering voltage-gated sodium channels, whereas it is dispensable for membrane stabilization at axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier.

The spectrin membrane skeleton is a polygonal cytoskeletal meshwork attached to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane (1Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The basic unit of the spectrin skeleton is a heterotetramer of two α-spectrin and two β-spectrin proteins. β-Spectrin has an N-terminal actin-binding domain, and the spectrin tetramers are bound to one another indirectly via short actin filaments to form the meshwork. β-Spectrin also binds to a membrane adaptor protein ankyrin via the spectrin repeat 15 (2Kennedy S.P. Warren S.L. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), thereby allowing the attachment of the spectrin-actin meshwork to the plasma membrane. Two major roles are known for the spectrin skeleton. One is to physically stabilize the plasma membrane integrity. In hereditary diseases with mutations in the erythrocyte-specific αI- and βI-spectrin genes, the erythrocyte membrane becomes fragile, resulting in elliptocytosis and spherocytosis, and eventually hemolytic anemia (3Delaunay J. Blood Rev. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The second role is to cluster specific integral membrane proteins at high density in specialized regions of the plasma membrane. For example, αII- and βII-spectrins stabilize the clustering of Na+/K+-ATPase at cell-cell contact sites in polarized epithelial cells through ankyrin B-mediated interaction with Na+/K+-ATPase (4Hu R.-J. Moorthy S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Axon initial segments (AIS) 2The abbreviations used are: AIS, axon initial segment; NR, node of Ranvier; VGSC, voltage-gated sodium channel.2The abbreviations used are: AIS, axon initial segment; NR, node of Ranvier; VGSC, voltage-gated sodium channel. and nodes of Ranvier (NR) are specialized axonal domains of the neuron that play essential roles in the firing and amplification of the action potential. The AIS is a short axonal segment located adjacent to the cell body. Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC) are highly concentrated at this site and open in response to neurotransmitter-triggered excitatory post-synaptic potential, leading to the firing of the action potential (5Bennett V. Lambert S. J. Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 303-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Peles E. Salzer J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Axons in vertebrate neurons are often wrapped with myelin sheaths produced by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system to increase the conduction velocity of the action potential. The NR is a short naked part of the axon between the myelin sheaths (7Arroyo E.J. Scherer S.S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 113: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 8Rasband M.N. Trimmer J.S. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). VGSC are also clustered at NR and open in response to the action potential that has been conducted through the myelinated part of the axonal membrane. In myelinated axons, therefore, the action potential is amplified each time it passes NR so that it does not attenuate before arriving at the axon terminal. βIV-Spectrin, one of the five β-spectrin family members in mammals, is a component of the spectrin skeleton at AIS and NR (9Berghs S. Aggujaro D. Dirkx Jr., R. Maksimova E. Stabach P. Hermel J.-M. Zhang J.-P. Philbrick W. Slepnev V. Ort T. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 985-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). At these sites, βIV-spectrin binds ankyrin G, an AIS- and NR-specific isoform of ankyrin (10Kordeli E. Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2352-2359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 11Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Ankyrin G in turn binds to VGSC (12Srinivasan Y. Elmer L. Davis J. Bennett V. Angelides K. Nature. 1988; 333: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Analyses of mutant mice lacking βIV-spectrin have revealed several roles of the spectrin skeleton at AIS and NR. First, the levels of ankyrin G and VGSC are reduced at AIS and NR in βIV-spectrin-deficient mice, indicating that through binding to ankyrin G, βIV-spectrin stabilizes the clustering of VGSC at these sites (11Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Second, the plasma membrane at NR is swollen, resulting in abnormal length and width of NR in the absence of βIV-spectrin (13Yang Y. Lacas-Gervais S. Morest D.K. Solimena M. Rasband M.N. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7230-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, the spectrin skeleton physically stabilizes the plasma membrane at NR. Finally, cytoplasmic vesicles are often accumulated around the nodal region in βIV-spectrin-deficient mice (13Yang Y. Lacas-Gervais S. Morest D.K. Solimena M. Rasband M.N. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7230-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although the nature of these vesicles is unknown, this phenotype suggests a role for βIV-spectrin also in vesicular transport through the axon. Consequently, loss of the βIV-spectrin function causes various neurological defects such as deafness, tremor, and muscle contraction in mice (11Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 13Yang Y. Lacas-Gervais S. Morest D.K. Solimena M. Rasband M.N. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7230-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Parkinson N.J. Olsson C.L. Hallows J.L. McKee-Johnson J. Keogh B.P. Noben-Trauth K. Kujawa S.G. Tempel B.L. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The classical β-spectrins consist of the N-terminal actin-binding domain, 17 tandem spectrin repeats, a variable region that is not conserved among different β-spectrins, and the C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain. For βIV-spectrin, cDNAs encoding six splice isoforms (Σ1-Σ6) have been reported (9Berghs S. Aggujaro D. Dirkx Jr., R. Maksimova E. Stabach P. Hermel J.-M. Zhang J.-P. Philbrick W. Slepnev V. Ort T. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 985-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 11Komada M. Soriano P. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 23974-23985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Whereas Σ2, Σ3, Σ4, and Σ5 have not been shown to be expressed as proteins, an N-terminal-truncated isoform Σ6, lacking the actin-binding domain and the first 10 spectrin repeats, is expressed at much higher levels than the full-length isoform Σ1 (11Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Σ6 does not fit in the classical Σ1-based meshwork of the spectrin skeleton, as it does not bind actin and is only about half the length of Σ1. This is a specific feature to βIV-spectrin among the five mammalian β-spectrins, because such a high level expression of truncated isoforms has not been found in other β-spectrins (1Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of the Σ6 isoform in βIV-spectrin suggests a unique membrane skeleton at AIS and NR. Although an essential role for Σ1 in stabilizing the plasma membrane integrity at NR has been shown using mutant mice lacking Σ1 but not Σ6 (16Lacas-Gervais S. Guo J. Strenzke N. Scarfone E. Kolpe M. Jahkel M. De Camilli P. Moser T. Rasband M.N. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the role for Σ6 has not been investigated. To study the role of the truncated βIV-spectrin isoform Σ6, we generated mice expressing Σ6 but not Σ1(Σ1-/- mice) and performed a side-by-side comparison of their phenotypes with those of previously generated mice lacking both Σ1 and Σ6 (Σ1Σ6-/- mice; Ref. 11Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). If a defect in Σ1Σ6-/- mice was to be rescued or ameliorated in Σ1-/- mice, it could be attributed to the loss of Σ6 function. We demonstrate that Σ6 is specifically required for the clustering of VGSC at AIS and NR. Derivation and Genotyping of Mutant Mice—The βIV-spectrin genomic locus was isolated from a 129/Sv genomic library using 5′ regions of cDNAs for Σ1 and Σ6. The Σ1-specific targeting vector was constructed using a neo expression cassette (PGKneolox2DTA; Ref. 17Komada M. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This targeting vector replaces a 4.6-kb genomic fragment containing exon 1 and part of exon 2, flanked by 1.6-kb PstI-PstI and 4.3-kb ApaI-ApaI genomic sequences derived from the cloned genomic DNA. The construct was electroporated into 129/S4-derived AK7 embryonic stem cells (17Komada M. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and colonies were selected with G418. Homologous recombination events were screened by the PCR as described (17Komada M. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), using primers corresponding to the neo gene and a genomic sequence outside the targeting construct. Southern blotting was performed according to standard procedures as described (17Komada M. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Tissue culture and blastocyst injections were performed as described (18Tokuzawa Y. Kaiho E. Maruyama M. Takahashi K. Mitsui K. Maeda M. Niwa H. Yamanaka S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2699-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). PCR genotyping of mice was performed on tail biopsy samples as described (17Komada M. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), using the following combination of primers: forward, 5′-AGGCTCTGATGTATGGGTGT-3′; reverse, 5′-ACTCCCACACTGCCACTCAC-3′; and neo,5′-GGATTGGGAAGACAATAGCAG-3′. Σ1Σ6-/- mice were generated by gene trapping in embryonic stem cells as described (11Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Both Σ1-/- and Σ1Σ6-/- mice were analyzed on the 129/S4 x C57BL/6J F1 genetic background. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Brains were homogenized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). After removing insoluble materials by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatants were incubated overnight with anti-αII-spectrin antibody (5 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). The immunoprecipitates, as well as the total supernatants, were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to the Trans-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Transferred proteins were then detected by immunoblotting. Primary antibodies used were anti-βIV-spectrin (1:400; Ref. 11Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and anti-αII-spectrin (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Secondary antibodies were peroxidase-conjugated anti-chicken IgY (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare) antibodies. Blots were detected using the ECL reagent (GE Healthcare). Immunofluorescence Staining—Brains and sciatic nerves were isolated from mice, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline, embedded in the Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Fine-technical, Tokyo, Japan), and sectioned at 10 μm using a cryostat. Sections were stained with chicken anti-βIV-spectrin (1:400; Ref. 11Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), mouse anti-ankyrin G (20 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-pan-sodium channel (10 μg/ml; Sigma), and rabbit anti-Nav1.6 (10 μg/ml; Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) antibodies. Secondary antibodies were Alexa 488- and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-chicken IgY, anti-mouse IgG, and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Fluorescence images were captured with a confocal microscope (Axiovert, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using the LSM5 PASCAL system (Carl Zeiss). Electron Microscopy—Mice were perfused with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Optic nerves were removed, cut into small pieces, immersed in the same fixative for 1 h, and postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer for 1 h. Fixed specimens were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in Quetol-812 (Nissin EM, Tokyo, Japan). Ultrathin sections were cut, counter-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed in an electron microscope (H-7500, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Organization of the Mouse βIV-Spectrin Gene—Schematic structures of the βIV-spectrin isoforms, Σ1 and Σ6, are depicted in Fig. 1A. Using mouse cDNA fragments corresponding to the N-terminal region of each of the two isoforms, we isolated genomic DNA fragments encompassing the exons encoding the 5′ region of the mRNAs for Σ1 and Σ6. The organization of these exons was determined by sequence analysis. Exon 1 of the βIV-spectrin gene corresponded to the 5′ non-coding region of Σ1 mRNA, and the translation initiation codon for Σ1 was located in exon 2 (Fig. 1B). The ATG codon encoding methionine 1321 of Σ1 in exon 19 is most likely to be the translation initiation codon for Σ6 because it is the most upstream ATG in Σ6 cDNAs (11Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We previously identified three Σ6 cDNAs with different 5′ non-coding regions (11Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Sequences corresponding to these non-coding regions were all found between exons 18 and 19 (Fig. 1B, 18b, 18c, and 18d), suggesting that the three Σ6 mRNAs are transcribed from different promoters located between exons 18 and 19. Generation of Σ1-/- Mice—To disrupt the expression of Σ1 without affecting that of Σ6, we constructed a gene targeting vector that replaces a 4.6-kb genomic sequence encompassing exon 1 and part of exon 2 (including the translation initiation codon for Σ1) with a neo cassette (Fig. 1C). Following electroporation of the construct into 129/S4-derived mouse embryonic stem cells and selection with G418, nine of ∼100 colonies scored positive for homologous recombination by a PCR screening. Homologous recombination in these clones was confirmed by genomic Southern blotting (Fig. 1D). Germline chimeras were derived from one of the clones and crossed to C57BL/6J mice to derive mutants. Heterozygous offspring did not display an overt phenotype. 3Y. Uemoto, S.-i. Suzuki, and M. Komada, unpublished data. Heterozygous mutant mice were intercrossed to derive Σ1-/- mice. Genotyping of the offspring by PCR using tail DNAs as templates (Fig. 1E) showed that the homozygous mice were recovered according to Mendelian expectations. 3Y. Uemoto, S.-i. Suzuki, and M. Komada, unpublished data. To examine the expression of Σ1 and Σ6 in the homozygous mutants, brain lysates from wild-type and Σ1-/- mice, as well as from a Σ1Σ6-/- mouse (11Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), were immunoblotted with anti-βIV-spectrin antibody. This antibody recognizes the variable region of βIV-spectrin, which is present in both Σ1 and Σ6 (Fig. 1A). The expression of Σ1 was completely abolished in the Σ1-/- brain (Fig. 2A, top). By contrast, the level of Σ6 expression in Σ1-/- brain was comparable with that in the wild type (Fig. 2A, top), indicating that Σ6 is not destabilized in the absence of the Σ1-based classical spectrin meshwork. Both Σ1 and Σ6 Form a Complex with αII-Spectrin in the Brain—αII-Spectrin is most likely the heterotetramerization partner for βIV-spectrin at the membrane skeleton of AIS and NR, because αII-, but not αI-, spectrin is expressed in neurons (19Sahr K.E. Laurila P. Kotula L. Scarpa A.L. Coupal E. Leto T.L. Linnenbach A.J. Winkelmann J.C. Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. Curtis P.J. Forget B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4434-4443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the level of αII-spectrin in Σ1-/- as well as in Σ1Σ6-/- brain. Immunoblotting of the brain lysates with anti-αII-spectrin antibody showed that αII-spectrin is expressed at comparable levels in wild-type, Σ1-/-, and Σ1Σ6-/- brains (Fig. 2A, bottom). To examine whether Σ1 and Σ6 interact with αII-spectrin in neurons, we next performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. αII-Spectrin was immunoprecipitated from brain lysates of wild-type, Σ1-/-, and Σ1Σ6-/- mice, then the precipitates were immunoblotted with anti-βIV-spectrin antibody. From wild-type lysate, αII-spectrin precipitated both Σ1 and Σ6 (Fig. 2B, top). No such co-precipitation was detected with the Σ1Σ6-/- lysate, indicating that they are not nonspecific signals (Fig. 2B, top). From the Σ1-/- lysate, αII-spectrin co-precipitated an amount of Σ6 similar to that precipitated from wild-type lysate (Fig. 2B, top). These results suggested that full-length isoform Σ1 indeed forms the spectrin meshwork with αII-spectrin, and more importantly, that the truncated isoform Σ6 is also able to form a complex with αII-spectrin in an Σ1-independent manner. Neurological Disorders in Σ1-/- Mice—Throughout this study, wild-type, Σ1-/-, and Σ1Σ6-/- mice were all examined on the same 129/S4 x C57BL/6J F1 hybrid genetic background. Like Σ1Σ6-/- mice (11Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), Σ1-/- mice exhibited tremor that was first observable at weaning. However, it was apparently milder than that of Σ1Σ6-/- mice. As they become older (usually >8 months old), Σ1Σ6-/- mice often exhibit continuous contraction of the hindleg muscle (Ref. 11Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar; supplemental Fig. S1). This phenotype was never observed in more than 50 Σ1-/- mice, which were older than 8 months (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition, Σ1Σ6-/- male mice are sterile (11Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This is most likely due to a neurological defect that affects sexual behavior, because the histology of their reproductive tissues (testis and epididymis) as well as the morphology and movement of isolated sperms appeared normal, and the mutant mice showed no sign of copulation with wild-type females as judged by the presence of vaginal plugs.3 When four Σ1-/- male mice were crossed with wild-type females, by contrast, they all exhibited normal fertility. Overall, the gross phenotypes observed in Σ1Σ6-/- mice were rescued or milder in Σ1-/- mice, indicating that Σ6 is essential for normal neuronal functions. Σ1-independent Localization of Σ6 to AIS and NR—Using the antibody against the variable region of βIV-spectrin (Fig. 1A), we examined the localization of Σ6 in Σ1-/- mice by immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections. Σ6 localized to AIS in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 3, B and D), as well as in other regions,3 of Σ1-/- brain. As expected from the much higher expression level of Σ6 than Σ1 in the brain (Ref. 11Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar; Fig. 2A), the level of anti-βIV-spectrin staining was not significantly reduced in Σ1-/- mice compared with that in wild-type mice (Fig. 3, A–D). Also in Σ1-/- sciatic nerve axons, Σ6 localized normally to NR, although the level of anti-βIV-spectrin staining was lower than in wild-type neurons (Fig. 3, E and F). These results suggested that the localization of Σ6 to AIS and NR is regulated by a Σ1-independent mechanism. Membrane Destabilization at AIS in Σ1-/- Mice—Although Σ6 localized to AIS, the anti-βIV-spectrin staining pattern of AIS was different between wild-type and Σ1-/- neurons both in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampus. Whereas wild-type neurons were smoothly and uniformly stained, Σ1-/- neurons exhibited waving AIS (Fig. 3, B and D). In addition, staining levels were uneven in different regions of individual AIS (Fig. 3, B and D, arrowheads). The same wavy phenotype was observed when Σ1-/- AIS in the cerebral cortex were stained with antibodies against ankyrin G and VGSC (Fig. 5, B′ and E′). These results suggested that the AIS membrane, which is defined by the presence of Σ6, is destabilized in the absence of Σ1, and therefore that the full-length isoform Σ1 is essential for maintenance of membrane stability at AIS. Membrane Destabilization and Vesicle Accumulation at NR in Σ1-/- Mice—The membrane architecture of NR in the central and peripheral nervous systems has been studied using electron microscopy in βIV-spectrin-deficient mice (13Yang Y. Lacas-Gervais S. Morest D.K. Solimena M. Rasband M.N. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7230-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16Lacas-Gervais S. Guo J. Strenzke N. Scarfone E. Kolpe M. Jahkel M. De Camilli P. Moser T. Rasband M.N. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We compared the ultrastructure of NR in optic nerves of our Σ1Σ6-/- and Σ1-/- mice in similar experiments. As reported, the NR plasma membrane of Σ1Σ6-/- and Σ1-/- mice exhibited a similar wavy and swollen phenotype (Fig. 4, B and C, compare with the normal membrane in Fig. 4A). Moreover, the fuzzy electron-dense undercoating of the nodal membrane in wild-type mice (Fig. 4A′, arrow) was absent in Σ1Σ6-/- as well as Σ1-/- mice (Fig. 4, B′ and C′, arrows). These similar defects in Σ1Σ6-/- and Σ1-/- NR suggested that also at NR, Σ1 but not Σ6 plays an essential role in stabilizing the membrane integrity. The other nodal phenotype in βIV-spectrin-deficient mice is the accumulation of cytoplasmic vesicular structures around the swollen NR membrane (13Yang Y. Lacas-Gervais S. Morest D.K. Solimena M. Rasband M.N. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7230-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16Lacas-Gervais S. Guo J. Strenzke N. Scarfone E. Kolpe M. Jahkel M. De Camilli P. Moser T. Rasband M.N. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, whether the loss of Σ6 is involved in this phenotype is unclear because the frequency of the appearance of such vesicles has not been compared between mice lacking both Σ1 and Σ6 and those lacking only Σ1. We therefore quantified the proportion of vesicle-associated NR (Fig. 4D, left), as well as the number of vesicles found around a single NR (Fig. 4D, right), in wild-type, Σ1-/-, and Σ1Σ6-/- optic nerves. For each genotype, 45 NR from three mice (15 NR from each) were examined. These parameters were not significantly different between wild-type and Σ1-/- NR, but were much higher in Σ1Σ6-/- NR. These results suggested that the formation of cytoplasmic nodal vesicles in Σ1Σ6-/- optic nerves is due largely, if not totally, to the lack of Σ6. Localization of Ankyrin G and VGSC at AIS in Σ1-/- Mice— We next compared the levels of ankyrin G and VGSC at AIS in wild-type, Σ1-/-, and Σ1Σ6-/- mice by staining brain sections with anti-ankyrin G and anti-pan-sodium channel antibodies. At AIS of the cerebral cortex in Σ1-/- mice, levels of both ankyrin G (Fig. 5B′) and VGSC (Fig. 5E′) were slightly lower than in wild-type mice (Fig. 5, A′ and D′). However, they were significantly higher than those in Σ1Σ6-/- mice (Fig. 5, C′ and F′). In addition, we found that the ankyrin G- and VGSC-positive regions of axons are apparently longer in Σ1Σ6-/- neurons than in wild-type neurons (Fig. 5, C′ and F′, compared with A′ and D′). No such abnormality was observed in Σ1-/- neurons (Fig. 5, B′ and E′). Measurement of the lengths of ankyrin G-positive regions on microscopic images showed that they are 25 ± 4, 23 ± 3, and 45 ± 4 μm (mean ± S.D.) for wild-type (n = 24 from three mice), Σ1-/- (n = 11 from two mice), and Σ1Σ6-/- (n = 22 from three mice) neurons, respectively (Fig. 5G). Also at AIS of Purkinje and granular neurons in the cerebellum, the levels of ankyrin G and Nav1.6 in Σ1-/- mice (supplemental Fig. S2, B, B′, E, and E′) were lower than in wild-type (supplemental Fig. S2, A, A′, D, and D′) but higher than in Σ1Σ6-/- mice (supplemental Fig. S2, C, C′, F, and F′). Nav1.6 is the major isoform of the VGSC β-subunit at AIS and NR (11Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 20Caldwell J.H. Schaller K.L. Lasher R.S. Peles E. Levinson S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5616-5620Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 21Jenkins S.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 22Jenkins S.M. Bennett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2303-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Here we detected Nav1.6 because the anti-pan-sodium channel antibody did not efficiently stain AIS of cerebellar neurons.3 The elongation of ankyrin G- and VGSC-positive axonal regions, however, was not observed in Purkinje neurons in Σ1Σ6-/- mice (supplemental Fig. S2). Localization of VGSC at NR in Σ1-/- Mice—We next examined the localization of Nav1.6 at NR in sciatic nerve axons. The anti-pan-sodium channel antibody also failed to stain the NR at detectable levels.3 The number of Nav1.6-positive NR was reduced in Σ1-/- mice (Fig. 6B′) compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 6A′). However, it was higher than that in Σ1Σ6-/- mice (Fig. 6C′). To quantify the reduction of the Nav1.6-positive NR in the mutants, the number of Nav1.6-positive NR in the sciatic nerve sections was counted under the microscope. Counting in nine randomly chosen fields (0.2 mm2 each) from three mice of each genotype revealed that in Σ1-/- and Σ1Σ6-/- axons, the number is reduced to 62 ± 17 and 34 ± 8% (mean ± S.D.), respectively, of that in wild-type axons (Fig. 6D). We were not able to examine the level of ankyrin G at NR because all of the tested anti-ankyrin G antibodies exhibited high nonspecific staining of the myelin sheath.3 Whereas analyses of βIV-spectrin Σ1-specific knock-out mice have revealed an essential role for the full-length isoform in stabilizing the membrane integrity at NR (16Lacas-Gervais S. Guo J. Strenzke N. Scarfone E. Kolpe M. Jahkel M. De Camilli P. Moser T. Rasband M.N. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the role and significance of the truncated isoform Σ6 have been totally unclear. Through a side-by-side comparison of Σ1Σ6-/- and Σ1-/- mice on the same genetic background, we here demonstrate that Σ6 plays a specific role in the clustering of VGSC at AIS and NR. Σ6 at AIS of Σ1-/- cerebral and hippocampal neurons exhibited a wavy and uneven staining pattern with anti-βIV-spectrin (Fig. 3). The same pattern was observed when AIS were stained for other AIS-specific membrane proteins, ankyrin G and VGSC (Fig. 5). These results suggest that in the absence of Σ1, the AIS membrane is ruffled and the cytoplasmic face of the membrane is unequally attached with the putative membrane skeleton composed of βIV-spectrin Σ6 and its binding partner αII-spectrin (Fig. 2). Unlike in the cerebral and hippocampal neurons, the abnormal staining pattern of AIS with anti-βIV-spectrin, anti-ankyrin G, and anti-VGSC antibodies was not apparent in cerebellar Purkinje neurons in Σ1-/- mice (supplemental Fig. S2). The reason for this difference is unclear. One possibility might be that sensitivity of membrane stability to the loss of βIV-spectrin Σ1 varies among the AIS of different neurons. As reported for other βIV-spectrin-deficient mice (13Yang Y. Lacas-Gervais S. Morest D.K. Solimena M. Rasband M.N. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7230-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16Lacas-Gervais S. Guo J. Strenzke N. Scarfone E. Kolpe M. Jahkel M. De Camilli P. Moser T. Rasband M.N. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the electron-dense fuzzy cytoplasmic undercoating was missing from the NR membrane of optic nerve axons also in our Σ1Σ6-/- and Σ1-/- mice (Fig. 4). This was accompanied by swelling of the NR membrane in these axons (Fig. 4). Taken together, the abnormal membrane architecture at AIS and NR of Σ1Σ6-/- and Σ1-/- mice suggests that Σ6 is dispensable for the stabilization of membrane integrity and that the classical spectrin meshwork formed by the full-length βIV-spectrin Σ1 and αII-spectrin plays an essential role. This is consistent with the situation in erythrocytes. The erythrocyte-specific βI-spectrin, which does not have an abundantly expressed truncated isoform like βIV-spectrin Σ6 (23Winkelmann J.C. Chang J.G. Tse W.T. Scarpa A.L. Marchesi V.T. Forget B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11827-11832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is capable of stabilizing the membrane integrity in these cells. In optic nerves of Σ1Σ6-/- mice, vesicular structures were often accumulated in the axonal cytoplasm in close proximity to NR (Fig. 4). The frequency of the appearance of such vesicles in Σ1-/- mice was much lower than that in Σ1Σ6-/- mice and was similar to that in wild-type mice (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the phenotype is largely rescued by the expression of Σ6, thus suggesting a Σ6-specific function. A previous study showed that also in Σ1-/- mice, vesicles are often accumulated around NR in sciatic nerves (16Lacas-Gervais S. Guo J. Strenzke N. Scarfone E. Kolpe M. Jahkel M. De Camilli P. Moser T. Rasband M.N. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, such accumulation of nodal vesicles was not demonstrated in optic nerves (16Lacas-Gervais S. Guo J. Strenzke N. Scarfone E. Kolpe M. Jahkel M. De Camilli P. Moser T. Rasband M.N. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, the degree of the phenotype might differ between the central and peripheral nervous systems. The identity of the vesicles is currently unknown. One possibility is that they are transport vesicles that deliver specific membrane proteins to NR and that their access to or fusion with the NR membrane is perturbed in the absence of Σ6. It is important in future studies to elucidate the relevant normal cellular process, impairment of which causes the vesicular phenotype in βIV-spectrin-deficient neurons. The levels of ankyrin G and VGSC were reduced to some extent at AIS and NR in Σ1-/- mice compared with wild-type mice (Figs. 5, 6, and supplemental Fig. S2). However, they were higher than those in Σ1Σ6-/- mice (Figs. 5, 6, and supplemental Fig. S2). These results suggest an essential role for Σ6 in stabilizing the membrane protein cluster containing ankyrin G and VGSC at these sites. In addition, the ankyrin G- and VGSC-positive AIS region in Σ1Σ6-/- cerebral cortex neurons is approximately twice as long as that in wild-type neurons (Fig. 5). Again, the length of the AIS region was normal in Σ1-/- neurons (Fig. 5). One explanation for this phenotype is that in the absence of Σ6, the destabilized membrane protein cluster diffuses toward the axon terminal from AIS. These results therefore further support the role of Σ6 in maintaining the clustering of VGSC at AIS and NR. A similar phenotype has been reported for Purkinje neurons in cerebellum-specific ankyrin G-deficient mice. In these mice, the AIS region positive for neurofascin 186, an AIS-specific cell adhesion molecule, is elongated at variable levels (24Ango F. di Cristo G. Hayashiyama H. Bennett V. Wu P. Huang Z.J. Cell. 2004; 119: 257-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In our βIV-spectrin Σ1Σ6-/- mice, however, this phenotype was not apparent in Purkinje neurons (supplemental Fig. S2). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear. How intensely this membrane skeletal function depends on βIV-spectrin Σ6 and ankyrin G may vary among neural cell types. The gross neurological defects observed in Σ1Σ6-/- mice, such as the tremor, hindleg contraction, and impaired sexual behavior in male, were ameliorated or not observed in Σ1-/- mice (see “Results” for details). This was correlated with the levels of ankyrin G and VGSC at AIS and NR, which were higher in Σ1-/- than in Σ1Σ6-/- mice (Figs. 5, 6, and supplemental Fig. S2). On the other hand, it was not correlated with the level of membrane destabilization at AIS and NR, which was similarly observed in Σ1-/- and Σ1Σ6-/- mice (Figs. 3, 4, 5). Therefore, the neurological disorders in Σ1Σ6-/- mice are likely to be due to the reduced level of VGSC at AIS and NR that probably results in insufficient firing and amplification of the action potential, rather than to the membrane fragility at these specific neuronal domains. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Σ6 interacts with αII-spectrin (Fig. 2). In the spectrin heterotetramer, α- and β-spectrins bind to each other in two ways. The anti-parallel lateral association is mediated by the binding of the first two spectrin repeats of β-spectrin with the last two spectrin repeats of α-spectrin (25Viel A. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10839-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Ursitti J.A. Kotula L. DeSilva T.M. Curtis P.J. Speicher D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6636-6644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The head to head association is mediated by the interaction between the last incomplete spectrin repeat of β-spectrin with the N-terminal region of α-spectrin (27Speicher D.W. DeSilva T.M. Speicher K.D. Ursitti J.A. Hembach P. Weglarz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4227-4235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kennedy S.P. Weed S.A. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11400-11408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As Σ6 harbors the last spectrin repeat but not the first two, it may form a head to head heterodimer with αII-spectrin at AIS and NR. However, how Σ6 fits in the membrane skeleton with αII-spectrin at AIS and NR is unclear. It is also unknown why such a truncated isoform, besides the full-length isoform Σ1, is required for the high density clustering of VGSC. These questions remain to be addressed in future studies. Nonetheless, the results presented here demonstrate an essential role for the unique truncated isoform of βIV-spectrin in neuronal function.

https://openalex.org/W2006429188,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) coordinates the cellular response to a lack of oxygen by controlling the expression of hypoxia-inducible genes that ensure an adequate energy supply. Assembly of the HIF-1 complex by its oxygen-regulated subunit HIF-1alpha and its constitutive beta subunit also known as ARNT is the key event of the cellular genetic response to hypoxia. By two-photon microscopy, we studied HIF-1 assembly in living cells and the mobility of fluorophore-labeled HIF-1 subunits by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. We found a significantly slower nuclear migration of HIF-1alpha than of HIF-1beta, indicating that each subunit can move independently. We applied fluorescence resonance energy transfer to calculate the nanometer distance between alpha and beta subunits of the transcriptionally active HIF-1 complex bound to DNA. Both N termini of the fluorophore-labeled HIF-1 subunits were localized as close as 6.2 nm, but even the N and C terminus of the HIF-1 complex were not further apart than 7.4 nm. Our data suggest a more compact 3-dimensional organization of the HIF complex than described so far by 2-dimensional models."
https://openalex.org/W2011065894,"Many Gram-negative pathogens utilize type III secretion systems (T3SS) to translocate effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells. Expression of T3SS genes is highly regulated and is often coupled to type III secretory activity. Transcription of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa T3SS genes is coupled to secretion by a cascade of interacting regulatory proteins (ExsA, ExsD, ExsC, and ExsE). ExsA is an activator of type III gene transcription, ExsD binds ExsA to inhibit transcription, ExsC inhibits ExsD activity, and ExsE inhibits ExsC activity. The entire process is coupled to secretion by virtue of the fact that ExsE is a secreted substrate of the T3SS. Changes in the intracellular concentration of ExsE are thought to govern formation of the ExsC-ExsE, ExsC-ExsD, and ExsD-ExsA complexes. Whereas formation of the ExsC-ExsE complex allows ExsD to bind ExsA and transcription of the T3SS is repressed, formation of the ExsC-ExsD complex sequesters ExsD from ExsA and transcription of the T3SS is induced. In this study, we characterized the self-association states of ExsC, ExsD, and ExsE and the binding interactions of ExsC with ExsE and ExsD.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen and a primary cause of pneumonia and urinary tract infections in intensive care units (1Richards M.J. Edwards J.R. Culver D.H. Gaynes R.P. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 27: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar, 2Richards M.J. Edwards J.R. Culver D.H. Gaynes R.P. Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 2000; 21: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Among the most vulnerable individuals are those with immunodeficiency, cystic fibrosis, or severe burns or who require mechanical ventilation. A major virulence determinant of P. aeruginosa is a type III secretion system (T3SS). 2The abbreviations used are: T3SS, type III secretion system; Tev, tobacco etch virus; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. The T3SS encodes a multiprotein complex, called an injectisome, which functions by injecting or translocating effector proteins directly into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic host cells. The T3SS of P. aeruginosa is used to translocate four known effectors that subvert signal transduction pathways to inhibit phagocytosis and elicit cytotoxicity toward host cells (3Barbieri J.T. Sun J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 152: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 4Sato H. Frank D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Expression of the P. aeruginosa T3SS is highly regulated and under the direct transcriptional control of ExsA, a member of the AraC family of transcriptional activators (5Frank D.W. Iglewski B.H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6460-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Environmental signals, including contact of P. aeruginosa with host cells and Ca2+-limiting growth conditions, induce ExsA-dependent transcription of the T3SS (6Vallis A.J. Yahr T.L. Barbieri J.T. Frank D.W. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 914-920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Frank D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of induction by host cell contact is unclear, Ca2+ depletion regulates T3SS gene transcription by inducing type III secretory activity (8McCaw M.L. Lykken G.L. Singh P.K. Yahr T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Transcription of T3SS genes is intimately coupled to type III secretory activity through a regulatory cascade that governs ExsA activity. This regulatory cascade consists of three interacting proteins (ExsD, ExsC, and ExsE). ExsD functions as an anti-activator by directly binding to and inhibiting ExsA-dependent transcription (8McCaw M.L. Lykken G.L. Singh P.K. Yahr T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). ExsC functions as an anti-anti-activator by binding to and antagonizing ExsD activity (9Dasgupta N. Lykken G.L. Wolfgang M.C. Yahr T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Finally, ExsE is an inhibitor of ExsC activity and a secreted substrate of the T3SS (10Urbanowski M.L. Lykken G.L. Yahr T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9930-9935Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 11Rietsch A. Vallet-Gely I. Dove S.L. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8006-8011Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Dasgupta et al. (9Dasgupta N. Lykken G.L. Wolfgang M.C. Yahr T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have proposed the following model to account for transcriptional induction of T3SS genes by Ca2+ depletion. Under Ca2+ replete conditions, ExsE is retained in the cytoplasm because of the lack of type III secretory activity and forms a complex with ExsC. The sequestration of ExsC by ExsE allows for the binding of the anti-activator ExsD to ExsA, thereby blocking transcription. In response to Ca2+ depletion, however, ExsE is secreted into the extracellular milieu. The corresponding decrease in intracellular ExsE levels releases ExsC, which then sequesters ExsD and thereby makes ExsA available to activate transcription of T3SS genes. A common feature of proteins secreted by the T3SS is the requirement for chaperone activity (12Feldman M.F. Cornelis G.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 219: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). ExsC has biochemical characteristics of a type III-specific chaperone and is required for ExsE stability within the cytoplasm and for ExsE secretion (9Dasgupta N. Lykken G.L. Wolfgang M.C. Yahr T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Urbanowski M.L. Lykken G.L. Yahr T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9930-9935Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). T3SS-specific chaperones fall into one of three classes based on substrate specificity. Class I, II, and III chaperones facilitate secretion of effectors, components of the translocation channel, and components of the injectisome, respectively (13Page A.L. Parsot C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Members of the Class I family are generally small in size (100–150 amino acids), acidic, and usually encoded adjacent to their cognate effector gene. Based on these characteristics, ExsC is likely a member of the class I chaperone family. The solved three-dimensional structures of several class I chaperones reveals a dimeric binding configuration with each monomer possessing a conserved fold consisting of five β-strands and three α-helices. Although the precise role of the T3SS chaperones is unclear, proposed functions include targeting of substrates to the secretion machinery, maintaining substrates in a secretion competent conformation, preventing substrate aggregation prior to secretion, and establishing a secretion hierarchy among different substrates (12Feldman M.F. Cornelis G.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 219: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the case of ExsC, the primary role appears to be protection of ExsE from proteolysis in the cytoplasm (10Urbanowski M.L. Lykken G.L. Yahr T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9930-9935Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition to the role in secretion, many type III-specific chaperones are also involved in transcriptional regulation of T3SS gene expression (14Parsot C. Ageron E. Penno C. Mavris M. Jamoussi K. d'Hauteville H. Sansonetti P. Demers B. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Wei C.F. Deng W.L. Huang H.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 520-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Walker K.A. Miller V.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4056-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ExsC functions as an anti-anti-activator by sequestering the ExsD anti-activator (9Dasgupta N. Lykken G.L. Wolfgang M.C. Yahr T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A recent study found that purified ExsC and ExsD individually form self-associated oligomeric complexes as judged by gel filtration chromatography (17Lykken G.L. Chen G. Brutinel E.D. Chen L. Yahr T.L. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, incubation of purified ExsC with ExsD resulted in the formation of a large molecular weight complex. Neither the subunit composition of the self-associated ExsC or ExsD complexes nor the binding stoichiometry of the ExsC-ExsD complex, however, could be accurately determined by gel filtration. In the present study the oligomeric states of ExsE, ExsC, ExsD, as well as the complexes of ExsC-ExsD and ExsC-ExsE were characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation. By this technique purified ExsE exists as monomers, ExsC forms homodimers, and ExsD self-associates into homotrimers. In addition, the subunit stoichiometry of the ExsC-ExsD and ExsC-ExsE complexes was resolved to 2:2 and 2:1, respectively. Thus, it appears that the trimeric ExsD dissociates in forming the heterotetrameric ExsC-ExsD complex, whereas the dimeric ExsC maintains during complex formation. The binding affinities for the ExsC-ExsD and ExsC-ExsE complexes were studied by isothermal calorimetry. The tighter interaction of the ExsC-ExsE (1 nm) complex when compared with the ExsC-ExsD (18 nm) complex is supportive of a model in which preferential binding of ExsC to ExsE results in inhibition of T3SS gene expression in the absence of type III secretory activity. Protein Expression and Purification—The genes encoding ExsC and ExsD were amplified by PCR and individually cloned into pET25b (Novagen) with NdeI/XhoI restriction sites resulting in carboxyl-terminal histidine-tagged (LEIKRASQPELAPEDPEDVEHHHHHH, 3088 Da) fusion proteins (termed ExsCHis6 and ExsDHis6). exsC with a Tev protease site before the carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag was also cloned into pET24a (Novagen) using NdeI/XhoI restriction sites (termed ExsCTev-His6). For the ExsC-ExsD and ExsC-ExsE co-expression studies, the genes were cloned into the pCOLADuet-1 (Novagen) expression vector. The gene encoding ExsC was PCR-amplified and cloned as an NcoI/NotI restriction fragment into the corresponding sites of MCS1 in pCOLA-Duet-1. ExsC expressed from this vector (ExsCHis6-short) carries a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag (LEHHHHHH, 1083 Da) encoded by the PCR primer. The genes encoding ExsD and ExsE were cloned into MSC2 as NdeI/XhoI restriction fragments. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) codon-plus (Novagen) grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of 0.6. The growth temperature was reduced to 23 °C before induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cell growth continued for 5–8 h. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole using a continuous flow microfluidizer (Microfluidics). The soluble fraction was loaded onto a Ni2+ chelating column (Amersham Biosciences), and bound protein was eluted over a linear imidazole gradient (5 mm to 500 mm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) and 300 mm NaCl. Protein fractions were combined, concentrated by Centriprep YM10 (Millipore), dialyzed against 50 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and loaded onto a FastQ column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted over a linear NaCl gradient (100–1000 mm) in 50 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Peak protein fractions were concentrated by Centriprep YM10 (Millipore), dialyzed against buffer (50 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). The purified protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE to be at least 95% pure. To obtain the native form of ExsC, purified ExsCTev-His6 was incubated with His6-tagged Tev protease at 4 °C for 72 h. The mixture was passed through Ni2+ chelating resin (Amersham Biosciences) to remove the digested His6-tag, the undigested ExsCTev-His6, and the Tev protease. The unbound material was loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column for further purification. The native form of ExsD was generated as follows. Purified ExsCHis6-short-ExsD complex was incubated with an excess amount of purified ExsEC (defined below) at 4 °C for 24 h, and the reaction mixture was loaded on a Ni2+ cheating column to remove ExsCHis6-short-ExsE and the residual ExsCHis6-short-ExsD. The unbound fraction was further purified by gel filtration via a Superdex 200 column. The gene encoding ExsE was PCR-amplified and cloned into pTWIN1 (New England Biolabs) as an NdeI/EcoRI restriction fragment resulting in an ExsE-chitin-binding fusion protein separated by an Mxe intein. Following cleavage of the intein, seven amino acid residues (EFLEGSS, 768 Da) remain at the carboxyl terminus of ExsE (designated ExsEC). Expression of ExsEC was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37°C. Cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA), and the cleared lysate was loaded onto a chitin column (New England Biolabs). The column was washed extensively with buffer A and then incubated with buffer B (buffer A plus 40 mm dithiothreitol (pH 8.5)) overnight at 4 °C to remove the intein fusion partner from ExsE. ExsEC was further purified using a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences). Analytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC)—Equilibrium sedimentation experiments were carried out at 25 °C using a Beckman XL-A Ultracentrifuge with an AN-Ti-60 rotor. The buffer for all the AUC experiments contained 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Data were collected at three protein concentrations and with different rotor speeds optimized according to the expected molecular weight: ExsCHis6 (0.75, 0.37, 0.19 mg/ml; 7900, 9500, 12,000, 14,000, 18,000 rpm); ExsDHis6 (0.2, 0.1, 0.05 mg/ml; 6500, 7800, 11,500 rpm); ExsEC (1.2, 0.86, 0.51 mg/ml; 13,000, 16,000, 23,000 rpm); ExsCHis6-short-ExsE (0.75, 0.38, 0.19 mg/ml; 9000, 11,000, 16,000 rpm); ExsCHis6-ExsDHis6 (0.3, 0.15, 0.075 mg/ml; 6000, 7500, 10,500 rpm); ExsCHis6-ExsEC (0.77, 0.38, 0.19 mg/ml; 8300, 10,000, 14,500 rpm). The scanning wavelength was 280 nm. The partial specific volume of each protein or protein complex was calculated from the amino acid sequence: ExsCHis6 (0.732 cm3 g–1), ExsDHis6 (0.723 cm3 g–1), ExsEC (0.711 cm3 g–1), ExsCHis6-ExsDHis6 (0.727 cm3 g–1), ExsCHis6-short-ExsE (0.723 cm3 g–1), and ExsCHis6-ExsEc (0.7279 cm3 g–1). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—ITC experiments were carried at 25 °C using a VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal). Protein samples were dialyzed overnight to a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA. Two experiments were performed for each study. For example, to study the interaction between ExsCHis6 and ExsDHis6, 30 injections of 10 μl of ExsCHis6 (150 μm) were titrated to 1.4 ml of ExsDHis6 (15 μm). A second experiment was done by reversing the injectant and the titratant: 30 injections of ExsDHis6 (110 μm) into 1.4 ml of ExsCHis6 (10 μm). Thermodynamic parameters of the binding process were derived using ORIGIN ITC software (OriginLab) by fitting the corrected binding isotherm to a single-site binding model. Protein Expression and Purification—To characterize the oligomeric state and binding interactions of ExsC, ExsE, and ExsD, each of the proteins was individually expressed in E. coli. ExsC and ExsD were expressed as carboxyl-terminally tagged hexahistidine fusion proteins (ExsCHis6 and ExsDHis6) and sequentially purified by Ni2+ affinity, ion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. ExsE was expressed as a chitin-binding domain fusion separated by an intein and purified by chitin affinity chromatography. Following intein cleavage and removal of the chitin binding domain, ExsE contained an additional seven amino acids at the carboxyl terminus (ExsEC). ExsEC was further purified by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1A). Each of the purified proteins was judged by SDS-PAGE to be >95% pure (Fig. 1B). Complexes of ExsC-ExsD and ExsC-ExsE were formed by incubating ExsDHis6 with a 2-fold molar excess of purified ExsCHis6 or ExsCHis6 with a 2-fold molar excess of ExsEC, respectively, and purified by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1A). The presence of individual components within each complex was verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). Oligomeric State of ExsC, ExsD, and ExsE—The respective molecular mass sizes of monomeric ExsCHis6 and ExsDHis6 are 19.342 and 33.941 kDa as determined by mass spectrometry. A previous study found that purified ExsCHis6 and ExsDHis6 migrate as 79- and 128-kDa molecular species, respectively, as determined by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1A) (17Lykken G.L. Chen G. Brutinel E.D. Chen L. Yahr T.L. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These findings indicated that purified ExsC and ExsD form self-associated oligomeric complexes, potentially tetrameric in state. To further assess the molecular weight of the self-associated complexes, we employed AUC. Using this technique the molecular weights of the ExsCHis6 and ExsDHis6 self-associated complexes was determined to be 47.2 ± 2.0 and 101.1 ± 1.6 kDa, respectively. These data suggest that ExsCHis6 exists as a dimer, whereas ExsDHis6 exists as a trimer. We also carried out AUC experiments on purified untagged ExsD (native form) and derived its molecular weight to be 96.6 ± 1.7 kDa, consistent with a homotrimeric state (predicted molecular mass = 97.3 kDa). Thus, the presence of the carboxyl-terminal His tag (3.1 kDa) did not affect the aggregation state of ExsD. The molecular weight of monomeric ExsEC is 9.422 kDa by mass spectrometry. Whereas ExsEC migrated as a 28-kDa molecular species by gel filtration (Fig. 1A), its molecular mass was found to be 9.5 ± 0.5 kDa by AUC, indicating that ExsEC exists in a monomeric state. For all three proteins, the larger molecular mass as estimated by gel filtration compared with that by AUC is indicative of an asymmetric molecular shape (18le Maire M. Viel A. Moller J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Stability of the Oligomeric State of ExsC and ExsD—To examine monomer interactions within the ExsD complex, mixture of ExsDHis6 and ExsD (1:1 molar ratio) as well as the individual ExsDHis6 and ExsD were kept at 4 °C for 24 h. The mixture was loaded onto a Ni2+ chelating column. Following extensive washing, bound protein was eluted over an imidazole gradient, and fractions corresponding to the elution peaks were concentrated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Because trimeric ExsD does not bind to the Ni2+ resin (see “Experimental Procedure”), it eluted as the unbound portion (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Nevertheless, a substantial amount of ExsD was also found in the fraction corresponding to the elution peak (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Presumably, this “bound” ExsD might be retained by the Ni2+ resin in forms of (ExsDHis6)n(ExsD)3 – n (n = 1 or 2). These data suggest that trimeric ExsD may dissociate into smaller oligomeric states (monomer and dimer) and reassemble to generate mixed trimeric species. A similar experiment was carried out using ExsCHis6 and native ExsC. In contrast to ExsD, native ExsC was not present in the elution fractions from the Ni2+ chelating column (data not shown). Taken together, it appears that the subunit assembly in trimeric ExsD is dynamic, whereas the monomer associations within dimeric ExsC are much stronger. Molecular Masses of the ExsC-ExsD and ExsC-ExsE Complexes—A previous study found that purified ExsCHis6 and ExsDHis6 readily formed a complex when co-incubated for 16 h at 4 °C (17Lykken G.L. Chen G. Brutinel E.D. Chen L. Yahr T.L. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The isolated ExsCHis6-ExsDHis6 complex migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 197 kDa by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the same complex by AUC, however, yielded a much smaller molecular mass of 100.1 ± 1.6 kDa (Fig. 2A). The AUC data are indicative of a complex consisting of two molecules of both ExsCHis6 and ExsDHis6 (which has a predicted molecular mass of 106.6 kDa). This conclusion is further supported by previous ITC data, which predicted an equal molar binding ratio of ExsC and ExsD within the complex (n = 0.87) (17Lykken G.L. Chen G. Brutinel E.D. Chen L. Yahr T.L. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similar to the experiments described above, incubation of purified ExsCHis6 with a molar excess of ExsEC resulted in the formation of an ExsCHis6-ExsEC complex. The complex isolated by gel filtration chromatography migrated as a 96.1-kDa species (Fig. 1A), and the presence of both ExsCHis6 and ExsEC were verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). By AUC, however, the molecular mass of the ExsCHis6-ExsEC complex was determined to be 46.9 ± 1.2 kDa (Fig. 2B). The ExsC-ExsE complex was also isolated by co-expressing ExsCHis6-short and native ExsE in E. coli and subsequent purification by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. This purified ExsCHis6-short-ExsE complex migrates as a 63.4-kDa species by gel filtration, and its molecular mass was determined by AUC to be 45.7 ± 1.0 kDa. Both molecular masses derived from AUC are consistent with a complex containing dimeric ExsC bound to one ExsE monomer (predicted molecular mass values: 48.1 kDa for ExsCHis6-ExsEC and 43.7 kDa for ExsCHis6-short-ExsE). Binding Stoichiometry of ExsC-ExsE Complex—Formation of the ExsC-ExsE complex was further examined by mixing purified ExsCHis6 and ExsEC in various molar ratios (1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4) and incubating them for 16 h at 4 °C. At molar ratios greater than 1:0.5, an excess of ExsEC was detected by gel filtration chromatography, suggesting that ExsCHis6 binds ExsEC in a 1:0.5 (or 2:1) molar ratio (Fig. 3A). This binding stoichiometry was further confirmed by ITC, where the binding ratio was determined to be 2.08 (Fig. 3B). These results, combined with the AUC data, are consistent with a complex consisting of one ExsCHis6 dimer bound to one monomer of ExsEC. Binding Affinity of ExsC for ExsD and ExsE—A previous study employing ITC found formation of the (ExsCHis6)2·(ExsDHis6)2 complex to be exothermic and energetically favorable, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 18 nm and an enthalpy release (ΔH) of 7.6 kcal/mol (17Lykken G.L. Chen G. Brutinel E.D. Chen L. Yahr T.L. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Using the same method, the Kd and ΔH of the (ExsCHis6)2·ExsEC complex were found to 1 nm and 31.5 kcal/mol, respectively (Fig. 3B), indicating that ExsC has a stronger binding affinity for ExsE when compared with ExsD. Three experiments were conducted to confirm that ExsC has a high binding affinity for ExsE. In the first experiment, samples of ExsCHis6, ExsDHis6, and ExsEC were co-incubated at a molar ratio of 1:1:0.5, respectively, and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h. Analysis of the mixture by gel filtration revealed a single peak (Fig. 4A). Because the elution profiles of the (ExsCHis6)2·ExsEC complex and the ExsDHis6 self-associated complex demonstrate significant overlap (Fig. 1A), fractions corresponding to the leading shoulder (fraction 1), peak (fraction 2), and trailing shoulder (fractions 3–4) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Fractions 1 and 2 consist primarily of ExsDHis6 (which elutes at 71.4 ml), whereas fractions 3 and 4 consist of a mixture of ExsDHis6 and the (ExsCHis6)2·ExsEC complex (which elutes at 74.7 ml). Notably, peaks corresponding to monomeric ExsEC (which elutes at 88.6 ml) and the (ExsCHis6)2·(ExsDHis6)2 complex (which elutes at 66.4 ml) were not detected. These data suggest that all of the ExsEC exists in a complex with ExsCHis6 and that ExsCHis6 does not bind to ExsDHis6 in the presence of ExsEC. The second experiment addressed whether ExsEC could disrupt the preformed (ExsCHis6)2·(ExsDHis6)2 complex. ExsEC was incubated with the purified (ExsCHis6)2·(ExsDHis6)2 complex for 16 h at 4 °C, and the mixture was analyzed by gel filtration. Remarkably, peaks corresponding to the input materials, monomeric ExsEC (88.6 ml) and the (ExsCHis6)2·(ExsDHis6)2 complex (66.4 ml), were greatly diminished (Fig. 4B). In place of the input materials was a composite elution profile with a peak centered at 72.2 ml, likely resulting from the overlapping elution profiles of (ExsCHis6)2·ExsEC and ExsDHis6. By SDS-PAGE, the leading shoulder (fraction 1) consisted mainly of ExsDHis6, whereas the trailing shoulder contained ExsCHis6 and ExsEC (fraction 4–5) or the (ExsCHis6)2·ExsEC complex. These results suggest that the (ExsCHis6)2·(ExsDHis6)2 complex dissociates in the presence of ExsEC, and that ExsEC forms a complex with ExsCHis6. Lastly, we tested whether a 2-fold molar excess of ExsDHis6 could dissociate the (ExsCHis6-short)2·ExsE complex by co-incubation overnight. The elution profile consisted of two peaks corresponding to (ExsDHis6)2 and the (ExsCHis6-short)2·ExsE complex. The absence a peaks corresponding to free ExsE or the (ExsDHis6)·(ExsCHis6-short)2 complex suggests that ExsDHis6 cannot competitively remove ExsCHis6-short from the (ExsCHis6-short)2·ExsE complex under the conditions tested (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that the binding affinity of ExsC is stronger for ExsE when compared with that of ExsD. The transcriptional activity of ExsA is controlled through a regulatory cascade consisting of ExsD, ExsC, and ExsE. ExsC is a key player in this regulatory cascade, as it forms a complex with either ExsE or ExsD. Binding of ExsC to ExsE prevents transcription of T3SS genes, whereas binding to ExsD leads to activation of T3SS gene transcription. Here we report that the native states of purified ExsC, ExsD, and ExsE are, respectively, dimeric, trimeric, and monomeric. Our ITC data indicate that the stoichiometry within the ExsC-ExsD complex is 1:1, and the molecular weight of the complex derived from AUC is consistent with a heterotetrameric complex of ExsC2·ExsD2. Similarly, both ITC and AUC data are in agreement that the binding ratio within the ExsC-ExsE complex is 2:1 and that the complex is a heterotrimer of ExsC2·ExsE. Affinity measurements and binding studies show that ExsC binds ExsE stronger than ExsD, supporting a model in which the preferential binding of ExsC to ExsE favors formation of the transcriptionally inactive ExsD-ExsA complex. Although the carboxyl-terminal tags used for purification of ExsC, ExsD, and ExsE did not affect self-association or complex formation, they did substantially increase the hydrodynamic volume of the proteins (as reflected by the decrease in the elution volume during gel filtration chromatography). For example, the carboxyl-terminal tags in the (ExsCHis6)2·ExsEC complex add an additional 4.4 kDa of mass relative to the (ExsCHis6-short)2·ExsE complex. This additional 4.4 kDa resulted in a drastic increase in the apparent molecular mass as estimated by gel filtration (63.4 kDa for the (ExsCHis6-short)2·ExsE complex when compared with 96.1 kDa for the (ExsCHis6)2·ExsEC complex). Similarly, the additional 10.1 kDa of mass in the (ExsCHis6)2·(ExsDHis6)2 complex when compared with the (ExsCHis6-short)2·ExsD2 complex results in an increase of 35.7 kDa in the molecular mass estimated by gel filtration (197.5 kDa for (ExsCHis6)2·(ExsDHis6)2 compared with 161.8 kDa for the (ExsCHis6-short)2·ExsD2 complex). In deriving the apparent molecular mass by gel filtration, a compact globular shape is assumed, and globular proteins are used in the standard calibration. For macromolecules with asymmetric shapes, the apparent molecular mass values from gel filtration tend to be significantly overestimated (18le Maire M. Viel A. Moller J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, the drastic increase in the hydrodynamic volume due to the presence of the carboxyl-terminal tag indicates that these extensions are highly flexible and contribute significantly to the asymmetric shape of the fusion proteins. In contrast to the gel filtration method, the molecular mass values derived from equilibrium sedimentation analytical ultracentrifugation do not rely on model presumption (19van Holde K.E. Johnson W.C. Ho P.S. Principles of Physical Biochemistry. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ1998: 194-212Google Scholar); therefore, AUC is an accurate technique to use in assessing the association states of self-associated and in complex. Within the experimental errors, AUC-derived molecular mass values of (ExsCHis6)2·ExsEC and (ExsCHis6-short)2·ExsE (46.9 ± 1.2 kDa and 45.7 ± 1.0 kDa, respectively) better reflect the predicted difference of 4.4 kDa and are in good agreements with their respective theoretical values. Members of the class I family of type III secretion chaperones, including SycE, SigE, SicP, and CesT (13Page A.L. Parsot C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), are homodimers, and the largely hydrophobic dimeric interface is extensive (20Birtalan S. Ghosh P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Luo Y. Bertero M.G. Frey E.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Wenk M.R. Creagh L. Marcus S.L. Lim D. Sicheri F. Kay C. Haynes C. Finlay B.B. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1031-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), suggesting a strong dimer association. In line with this structural observation, subunit dissociation of the dimeric ExsC reported in this study is minimal. Another structural feature conserved in these secretion chaperones is the exposure of hydrophobic patches on the surface of the homodimer. These hydrophobic regions have been implicated in the interaction with the secreted substrate, and the hydrophobic interaction has been further shown to be the major contributing factor to the energy release resulting from complex formation (20Birtalan S. Ghosh P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our observation that a large enthalpy (ΔH = –31.5 kcal/mol, from ITC experiments) is released accompanying the ExsC-ExsE complex formation supports the idea that the interaction between ExsC and ExsE is also mainly hydrophobic. Like other secretion chaperones (20Birtalan S. Ghosh P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the dimeric structure of ExsC is very likely unaffected upon forming the complex with the secreted substrate ExsE. The proposed functions of secretion chaperones include protecting the substrate from degradation, preventing the substrate from aggregation or premature interaction with downstream components, maintaining the substrate in a secretion-competent state, and together with the substrate forming a targeting motif for secretion (23Ghosh P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 771-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In Salmonella typhimurium, the type III secretion chaperone SicP is required to stabilize the structure of its substrate SptP. In the absence of SicP mutant, the degradation rate of SptP is elevated (24Fu Y. Galan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3393-3399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, ExsC has been shown to stabilize ExsE and increase the efficiency of ExsE secretion (10Urbanowski M.L. Lykken G.L. Yahr T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9930-9935Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although highly soluble, ExsE does not adopt substantial secondary or tertiary structure as suggested by circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies. 3Z. Zheng, E. D. Brutinel, T. L. Yahr, and L. Chen, unpublished results. The lack of structural elements suggests that ExsE exists as an assembly of various conformations, i.e. that its structure is highly dynamic. It is conceivable that only certain conformations are compatible for binding ExsC. For ExsE, loss of conformational freedom because of complex formation with ExsC may account for the overall entropy decrease measured by ITC (ExsC2 + ExsE → ExsC2·ExsE, ΔS =–64.7 cal/mol). In comparison, the entropy change is favorable for ExsC·ExsD complex formation (ExsC2 + ExsD3 → ExsC2·ExsD2, ΔS = +11.3 cal/mol). The unfavorable entropic decrease in forming the ExsC-ExsE complex is overcome by the large amount of enthalpic release, as discussed above, such that the overall complex formation is thermodynamic favorable (ΔG < 0). Our data thus far support a model in which by assisting ExsE in adopting certain conformations, ExsC confers structural stability to ExsE and may possibly prime ExsE for secretion. Besides interacting with ExsE as a secretion chaperone, ExsC also forms complex with the anti-activator ExsD to regulate T3SS gene transcription (9Dasgupta N. Lykken G.L. Wolfgang M.C. Yahr T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our observation of dynamic interaction between subunits in the trimeric ExsD supports a mechanism for ExsC-ExsD complex formation in which one monomer dissociates from the trimeric ExsD, whereas the other two monomers may be rearranged to accommodate the dimeric ExsC. The enthalpy release during this complex formation is modest (7.6 kcal/mol) compared with that of ExsC-ExsE formation, suggesting that the interaction in ExsC-ExsD complex is unlike that in ExsC-ExsE, which is largely hydrophobic. The difference in the nature of these interactions (as reflected by the difference in enthalpy change) suggests that ExsD and ExsE may bind to discrete regions of ExsC. Ultimately, determining the binding sites of ExsD and ExsE on ExsC, as well as the interplay between ExsC and ExsD or ExsC and ExsE, will await structural determination of the ExsD-ExsC and ExsC-ExsE complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2059305916,"Peptide O-xylosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.26) is the first enzyme required for the generation of chondroitin and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans. Cloning of cDNAs has previously shown that, whereas invertebrates generally have a single xylosyltransferase gene, vertebrate genomes encode two similar proteins, xylosyltransferase I and II (XT-I and XT-II). To date, enzymatic activity has only been demonstrated for the human XT-I, Caenorhabditis SQV-6, and Drosophila OXT isoforms. In the present study, we demonstrate that a soluble form of human XT-II expressed in the xylosyltransferase-deficient pgsA-745 (S745) Chinese hamster ovary cell line is indeed capable of catalyzing the transfer of xylose to a variety of peptide substrates; its enzyme activity was also proven using a Pichia-expressed form of XT-II. Its pH, temperature, and cation dependences are similar to those of XT-I expressed in either mammalian cells or yeast. Our data suggest that XT-I and XT-II are, at least in vitro, functionally identical."

High pressure induces an irreversible aggregation of the ferrous deoxy α-chains, whereas the AHSP/α-Hb complex shows reversible hexacoordination of the α-Hb without protein aggregation. Upon pressure release, the relaxation kinetics of the transition from the hexacoordinated to pentacoordinated form of α-Hb in the presence of AHSP exhibit a biphasic shape. High pressure did not induce dissociation of α-Hb from its chaperone, as evidenced by the ligand binding kinetics that show a unique rate for the AHSP/α-Hb complex.

The α and β hemoglobin subunits of human adult hemoglobin (HbA) form a heterotetramer (α2β2) in red blood cells leading to a cooperativity of oxygen binding. Although the α and β genes are localized in different chromosomes, there is a coordinated expression to generate a functional and stable allosteric tetramer. The consequence of an excess of either chain is a pathological disorder generally known as thalassemia. Moreover it is know that isolated α-hemoglobin (α-Hb) is unstable, poorly soluble, and subject to aggregation and formation of Heinz bodies, as found in β-thalassemia (1Weatherall D.J. Clegg J.B. The Thalassemia Syndromes.4th Ed. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford2001Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar).The discovery of a molecular chaperone, AHSP, indicates an additional protein-protein reaction involved in the mechanism of pathological disorders induced by an excess of α-Hb (2Kihm A.J.

Recently, a crystallization of the α-Hb/AHSP complex revealed the key elements of the interaction (5Feng L. Gell D.A. Zhou S. Gu L. Kong Y. Li J. Hu M. Yan N. Lee C. Rich A.M. Armstrong R.S. Lay P.A.

The AHSP/α-Hb interface (Fig. 1) is quite comparable to the α1β1 interface in Hb dimers and can thus explain the competition of β-Hb and AHSP for binding α-Hb (5Feng L. Gell D.A. Zhou S. Gu L.

The pyrrole nitrogens occupy the four equatorial binding sites, and one of the proximal axial sites is coordinated by a highly conserved His side chain. This proximal coordinated-covalent bond stabilizes the protein structure by slowing heme dissociation and influences the reactivity of the heme iron on the distal side. The opposite, or distal side, is generally available for ligand binding.The binding of AHSP to oxygenated ferrous α-Hb induces a conformational change of the F helix near to the active site of α-Hb, which may weaken the bond between the iron atom and the proximal histidine, while increasing the probability of interaction with the distal His (7Feng L.

Actually, much evidence tends to suggest that the regulation of the HisE7 binding is governed by the movement of the E-helix leading to the presence of two conformations of the protein. The fact that Ngb can switch between two forms, with and without the disulfide bond, may require a more flexible protein structure. For example, the affinity for the distal histidine decreases by nearly an order of magnitude once the disulfide bridge is reduced (13Hamdane D. Kiger L. Dewilde S. Green B.N. Pesce A. Uzan J.

The combination of temperature and high pressure studies clearly shows that the stability of these globins is correlated with the hexacoordination probably through the stabilization of the heme pocket environment (13Hamdane D.

High pressure constitutes an elegant approach in the study of protein-protein interactions. In fact, it has been shown that high pressure destabilizes weak interactions such as hydrophobic bonds and salt bridges that play important roles in maintaining the three-dimensional protein structure (16Silvia J.L. Foguel D. Royer C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Using this method, we demonstrate that high pressure induces a reversible bi-histidyl hexacoordination of the α-Hb iron atom in the presence of its molecular chaperone. The results suggest a protective role of AHSP to avoid precipitation of the α-Hb. The reaction of ferric α-Hb with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) within the complex also shows a protective role of AHSP toward α-Hb, possibly to prevent cellular damage initiated by the reaction of hemoproteins with H2O2.MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of α-Hb and AHSP/α-Hb Complex—After reaction of human Hb with p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid, the isolated α-Hb chains were purified by ion exchange chromatography as described previously (17Geraci G.

Biochem. 1992; 24: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with slight modification. The isolated α-Hb chains were then saturated with CO and stored at -80 °C.AHSP was expressed as a GST fusion protein and purified as described previously (8Vasseur-Godbillon C. Hamdane D. Marden M.C.

The GST-AHSP/α-Hb complex was obtained after adding an excess of carbonmonoxy α-Hb chains to GST-AHSP fixed to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads as previously described (8Vasseur-Godbillon C. Hamdane D.

The samples were also analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superose™ 12 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) eluted at 25 °C with a 150 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5, or with phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4 (19Baudin-Creuza V.

Tris buffer, rather than phosphate buffer, was chosen for experiments versus pressure because the variation of pH versus pressure of about 0.02 units per kilobar is much lower (20Newman R.C. Kauzmann W. Zipp A. J. Phys. Chem. 1973; 77: 2687-2691Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar).The globin concentration used for high pressure studies was typically 10 μm α-Hb (on a heme basis) determined from the carbonmonoxy form, using an extinction coefficient of 190 mm-1·cm-1 of the Soret band. Spectral measurements under high pressure were obtained using a 700 MPa high pressure optical cell interfaced to a Cary 3E spectrophotometer. The deoxy samples were obtained by equilibration under nitrogen following an adding of a 10-fold excess of sodium dithionite. The CO form of α-Hb or the AHSP/α-Hb complex was obtained after equilibration of the samples under 1 atm CO for about 15 min, followed by addition of an excess of dithionite. All absorption spectra were corrected for the compressibility of the solvent as described previously (15Hamdane D. Kiger L. Hui Bon Hoa G. Dewilde S. Uzan J. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Moens L.

Kiger L. Hui Bon Hoa G. Dewilde S. Uzan J. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Moens L. Marden M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36809-36814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The high pressure bomb fit snugly into a Cary 3E spectrophotometer sample compartment thus minimizing any movement relative to the light path. The sample previously equilibrated in the appropriate condition was introduced into the high pressure quartz optical cuvette of volume of 450 μl and an optical path of 5 mm. The globin solution was isolated from the compression fluid (pentane) through two thin (0.1 mm) teflon membranes. The high pressure was generated with a modified 700 MPa pump (Top Industry, Vaux le Pénil, France) of volume 4 cm3 with a piston possessing a double Bridgman seal. The pressure was increased in 50 MPa increments and held for 3 min before the spectral measurements to assure a stability of the final pressure. The temperature of the high pressure cell was maintained by a circulating water bath.Kinetics of Relaxation of the AHSP/α-Hb Complex—Briefly, the kinetic experiments after pressure release were done after 3 min of equilibration of the sample in the pressure cell at 300 MPa and at the desired temperature. The kinetics were started by a pressure release and were followed by monitoring the absorbance changes at different wavelengths (536, 561 nm) of the ferrous AHSP/α-Hb spectrum. The rates were obtained by fitting the kinetics to the bi-exponential Equation 1, ΔAN(t)=A1exp(−k1×t)+A2exp(−k2×t) (Eq. 1) where A is the amplitude, and k is the rate coefficient. The relaxation kinetics were recorded at different temperatures, and the activation energy of the transition low spin to high spin was calculated from the Arrhenius plot.Ligand Binding under High Pressure—Kinetics of CO recombination were obtained after flash photolysis using 10-ns YAG laser pulses (Quantel, France) at 532 nm. The CO association rates versus high pressure were obtained by a laser flash photolysis as described previously (15Hamdane D. Kiger L. Hui Bon Hoa G. Dewilde S. Uzan J. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Moens L. Marden M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36809-36814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The samples were equilibrated under different CO concentrations and then reduced with an excess of sodium dithionite. The concentration of α-Hb and the complex of α-Hb with AHSP was typically 20 μm. The CO rebinding reaction for the pentacoordinated species was analyzed by fitting the time course of the absorbance change at 436 nm with a monoexponential curve in Equation 2, ΔA0exp(−kobst) (Eq. 2) where kobs=(konCO)×[CO]. From the pressure dependence of ligand binding kinetics, the activation volume (ΔV≠) of the ligand binding reaction (the volume change between the transition state with respect to the initial state) can be determined from the slope of the plot of lnk versus pressure shown in Equation 3, ΔV≠=−RT[∂ ln k/∂P]T (Eq. 3) where R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol-1 K-1), T is absolute temperature, and k is the observed rate.Reaction of Ferric α-Hb with H2O2—The reactions were performed by incubating free α-Hb or AHSP/α-Hb complex (30 μm heme basis) in 100 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, 25 °C with different concentrations (15 μm to 3 mm) of H2O2. After 5 min of incubation, a 30-μl aliquot was withdrawn and mixed with 10 μl of concentrated SDS loading buffer. The sample was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.RESULTSAbsorption Spectra versus Pressure—The absorption spectra of ferrous deoxy α-Hb in the presence of AHSP at pressures from 0.1 MPa to 400 MPa are shown in Fig. 2. The optical spectra at atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa) of the deoxy ferrous α-Hb or AHSP/α-Hb are similar to those observed for the classical deoxy pentacoordinated form of hemoglobin and myoglobin as shown in Fig. 2 (solid blue line). The spectra of ferrous α-Hb and AHSP/α-Hb have the Soret band near 430 nm and a single broad band in the visible region around 555 nm (Fig. 2). Increasing pressure induced a red shift of the Soret band (Fig. 2) and a splitting of visible band into distinct α and β bands at 531 and 561 nm, respectively (Fig. 2). The enhanced amplitude for the α band is similar to that of the ferrous Hx form of the new vertebrate globins Ngb and cytoglobin (13Hamdane D. Kiger L. Dewilde S. Green B.N. Pesce A. Uzan J.

An overlay of a normalized spectrum of Ngb superposed the spectra of the AHSP/α-Hb complex at 400 MPa (Fig. 2), indicating a low spin configuration of the heme of the α-Hb chains.FIGURE 2Absorption spectra versus pressure for ferrous deoxy α-Hb in the presence of AHSP.

After decompression from 400 MPa to 0.1 MPa, the AHSP/α-Hb complex exhibits a full reversibility, whereas free α-Hb remains in the Hx form (···). The experimental conditions were in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.0, 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)After the pressure release from 400 MPa to 0.1 MPa, the AHSP/α-Hb complex exhibits the original pentacoordinated form without any loss of heme, indicating a full reversibility of the hexacoordination. On the other hand, free α-Hb did not recover the deoxy ferrous pentacoordinated form (Fig. 3). The transition of free α-Hb was more abrupt (involving an irreversible protein denaturation) than the transition of the complex (Fig. 3) suggesting that AHSP allowed some degree of flexibility on the structure of α-Hb. The pressure that induced the formation of 50% of the Hx form was shifted by 60 MPa in the presence of the α-chaperone (120 MPa for α-Hb and 180 MPa for the complex) (Fig. 3). Note that the reaction is not reversible for isolated α-Hb.The measured molar reaction volume change (ΔVo = VHexa - VPenta) associated with iron spin state transition (high to low spin) was obtained from the plot of ln(Keq = [Hx]/[pentacoordinated]) versus pressure (Fig. 4). The ΔVo of the iron spin transition was -60 ± 3 cm3/mol for the AHSP/α-Hb complex, which is roughly the equivalent of three water molecules (18 cm3/mol at 1 atm). This value of ΔVo is higher than those previously reported for other hemoproteins, which was estimated in general between -10 and -50 cm3/mol (21Ogunmola G.B. Kauzmann W. Zipp A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The evidence came from the reversibility of the pressure cycle and the rate of CO recombination at high pressure. A dissociation would likely lead to aggregation of the α-Hb subunits as observed for α-Hb without AHSP. The products of the pressurized samples were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography; we obtained a single elution peak (data not shown) at a volume corresponding to 33.7 kDa (Ve = 13.75 ml) as previously observed for the AHSP/α-Hb complex (19Baudin-Creuza V.

We chose to perform the experiment at 300 MPa because the AHSP/α-Hb complex is nearly 100% Hx at this pressure. The absorbance at 561 nm (Fig. 5) as well as at 536 nm (not shown) was normalized by the expected delta absorbance at 561 nm (at 300 MPa), just before the decompression (100% Hx) and after the end of the reaction (100% pentacoordinated). At both wavelengths, the kinetics were similar. The kinetic shape was biphasic with a rapid phase accounting for about two-thirds of the signal, followed by a phase requiring several minutes to obtain a full recovery of the equilibrium form with a rate constant k = 0.02 s-1. To slow down the rapid phase, we decreased the temperature from 37 to 5 °C. This procedure was still not sufficient to observe the total kinetics. In less than 20 s, we recovered 65% of the pentacoordinated AHSP/α-Hb form. The rate constant of the second phase showed a weak temperature dependence with an Ea around 5.5 kcal·mol-1. The Arrhenius plot was linear indicating a simple low to high spin transition.FIGURE 5Kinetics of the transition low to high spin of the AHSP/α-Hb complex after decompression at different temperatures. A rapid recovery, occurring within a few seconds, is followed by a slower phase requiring several minutes to obtain the original (pentacoordinated) absorption spectrum.

Bersani F. Accornero P. Forni P.E. Miretti S. Grinza A. Allegra P. Schmitt-Ney M. Crepaldi T. Ponzetto C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4742-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We had previously shown that Met is up-regulated in vivo by the chimeric transcription factor PAX3-FKHR (16Relaix F. Polimeni M. Rocancourt D. Ponzetto C. Schafer B.W. Buckingham M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2950-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the pathogenetic marker for Alveolar RMS, and that cells from mutant mouse embryos expressing a signalingdead Met receptor are unable to form colonies in soft agar after PAX3-FKHR transduction (15Taulli R. Scuoppo C. Bersani F. Accornero P. Forni P.E. Miretti S. Grinza A. Allegra P. Schmitt-Ney M. Crepaldi T. Ponzetto C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4742-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing HGF/SF are predisposed to develop RMS (17Takayama H. LaRochelle W.J. Sharp R. Otsuka T. Kriebel P. Anver M. Aaronson S.A. Merlino G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and show a very high incidence of RMS when combined with Ink4a/Arf inactivation (18Sharp R. Recio J.A. Jhappan C. Otsuka T. Liu S. Yu Y. Liu W. Anver M. Navid F. Helman L.J. DePinho R.A. Merlino G. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). All the above evidences suggest that Met plays a critical role in rhabdomyosarcoma genesis. Recently, a conditional mouse model of alveolar RMS obtained by targeting PAX3-FKHR expression to differentiating skeletal muscle has led to the hypothesis that this tumor may derive from terminally differentiating myofibers (19Keller C. Arenkiel B.R. Coffin C.M. El Bardeesy N. DePinho R.A. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2614-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In this work to further explore this concept we adopted the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) system to induce expression of an oncogenic form of Met (Tpr-Met) in differentiating muscle fibers. In the Tpr-Met oncoprotein the N-terminal region of Tpr, which includes two strong dimerization motifs, is fused to the tyrosine kinase moiety of Met, which is, thus, constitutively active in the absence of the ligand (20Park M. Dean M. Cooper C.S. Schmidt M. O'Brien S.J. Blair D.G. Vande Woude G.F. Cell. 1986; 45: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Expression of Tpr-Met in differentiating muscle did not result in development of musculoskeletal tumors but, rather, caused dramatic muscle wasting concomitant with the induction of proteasomal and lysosomal proteolysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration and Identification of Transgenic Mice—Mice harboring the MCK-tTA (skeletal muscle-specific) promoter construct were kindly donated by Dr. P. Plotz (21Nagaraju K. Raben N. Loeffler L. Parker T. Rochon P.J. Lee E. Danning C. Wada R. Thompson C. Bahtiyar G. Craft J. Hooft V.H. Plotz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9209-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and kept in a C57BL/6 background. MCK-tTA heterozygotes were interbred, and homozygous mice were selected by Southern and dot blot. The Tpr-Met cDNA (22Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. dalla Z.P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRI, and overhangs were blunted using T4 DNA polymerase and ligated into the PvuII site of pBI-GFP vector (Clontech) to generate the bidirectional Tpr-Met-TRE-GFP responder construct. The Tpr-Met-TRE-GFP construct was cut with AseI, and a 5.9-kilobase gel-purified fragment was microinjected into the fertilized eggs of FVB mice in the San Raffaele-Telethon Core Facility for Conditional Mutagenesis (Milan, Italy). Founder mice were identified by PCR analysis of genomic DNA prepared from tail biopsies. A total of seven transgenic founders were obtained upon two series of microinjections. Ear fibroblasts from all responders but one (#20) expressed GFP upon infection with LV-TA1 lentiviral vector carrying the tTA under the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. The various founders showed strong GFP expression variability (#12 > #8 > #9 > #4 > #2 > #15), with the highest levels found in mouse #12. Lines were established from these founders, analyzed by Southern blots, and maintained in a FVB background. Two independent target lines segregated in the F1 progeny from founder #12 (#12.2 and #12.9) and were chosen for breeding to MCK-tTA transactivator mice. Mice were genotyped by PCR analysis of tail genomic DNA. The tTA transgene was identified with primers annealing to tTA cDNA, 5′-AAG TGA TTA ACA GCG CAT TAG AGC-3′ and 5′-TTC AAG GCC GAA TAA GAA GGC TGG-3′, resulting in a 547-bp fragment. The Tpr-Met-TRE-GFP responder transgene was identified with a primer annealing to exon 20 of Met, 5′-AGA GGA GCC CCT CCT TAT CC-3′, and the other to the β-globin poly(A) sequence downstream of the Tpr-Met transgene, 5′-GGT CCC CAA ACT CAC CCT GAA GTT CTC-3′, resulting in a 665-bp fragment. The transgene integration sites in different Tpr-Met-TRE-GFP responder lines were analyzed by Southern blot. Ten micrograms of mouse tail genomic DNA were digested with HindIII restriction enzymes and subjected to Southern blotting and hybridization using Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and ULTRAhyb (Ambion). The 32P-labeled probe (Rediprime, Amersham Biosciences) was a 1.2-kilobase fragment of human c-Met cDNA (from nucleotides 3225 to 4409). The MCK-tTA transgene status was analyzed after EcoRI digestion of genomic DNA with a 32P-labeled 1.5-kilobase probe prepared from EcoRI-HindIII-digested pTEToff plasmid (Clontech). Undigested DNA was used for dot blot analysis with the same probe. Crosses were carried out between MCK-tTA homozygotes and Tpr-Met-TRE-GFP heterozygotes. Doxycycline (Sigma) was diluted in 3% sucrose in water to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml and supplied as drinking water with changes every 2-3 days. Transmission of both transgenes followed typical Mendelian inheritance patterns. In vivo GFP fluorescence was monitored by using a fluorescent light box, illuminated by blue light fiber optics and imaged by Olympus Camedia camera. Litters from double transgenic animals maintained without Dox (TprMet Ind. mice) were screened at P1; 26 of 26 TprMet Ind. mice derived from line #12.9 and 16 of 26 TprMet Ind. mice derived from line #12.2 were green fluorescent and died perinatally. The lower penetrance of the lethal phenotype in TprMet Ind. mice derived from line #12.2 as compared with 100% penetrance of line #12.9 is likely due to positional effect and variegated expression. All subsequent experiments were carried out on TprMet Ind. mice derived from line #12.9. For postnatal induction, doxycycline was administered to pregnant mothers throughout gestation and lactation, and the Dox was removed at weaning (p21). In vivo imaging of GFP expression was detected 2-3 weeks after induction. Animals developing massive atrophy (50% weight loss with respect to uninduced controls) within two months of age were analyzed. Samples of muscle derived from an experimental mouse model of cancer cachexia were kindly provided together with the controls by Dr. Paola Costelli. Briefly, BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously with the colon carcinoma cell line C-26 (5 × 105 cells per mouse) according to Matsumoto et al. (23Matsumoto T. Fujimoto-Ouchi K. Tamura S. Tanaka Y. Ishitsuka H. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the hindlimb muscles were recovered 12 days later for Western blot analysis. All animal procedures were approved by the Ethical Commission of the University of Torino, Italy, and by the Italian Ministry of Health.Ear Fibroblasts and Satellite Cells Cultures—Ear biopsies from transgenic founders were minced and digested with 1 μg/μl collagenase/dispase (Roche Applied Science) in Dulbecco’s PBS supplemented with CaCl2 and MgCl2 (D-PBS; Sigma) for 120 min at 37 °C with shaking. The digestion was stopped by adding 1:3 fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Euroclone), and crushed tissue was plated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Euroclone) plus 10% FBS in 24-well plates. Fibroblasts adhered to the bottom of the plate after 1 week. Cells were passaged every 3-4 days. Satellite cells were isolated from muscles of 17-day-old double transgenic mice (MCKtTA/Tpr-Met-TRE-GFP) kept in Dox from conception. After removal of skin, fat tissue, and bones, hindlimb muscles were digested with 1 μg/μl collagenase/dispase in D-PBS for 40-50 min at 37 °C with shaking. During the proteolytic digestion, tissues were occasionally fragmented by repeated pipetting. The digestion was stopped by adding 1:3 fetal bovine serum in D-PBS. The debris was removed by filtration through a 70-μm sterile filter, and cells were collected by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended in complete GM growth medium (F-10 HAM; Sigma) containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 3% chicken embryo extract and 2.5 ng/ml bovine fibroblast growth factor (Peprotech)). Cells were preplated overnight to discard contaminating fibroblasts and then non-adherent cells were plated in GM on collagen (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma)-coated plates. Single satellite cells started to be visible after 2-3 days of culture. Cells were passaged every 3 days, when they were ∼70% confluent using EDTA 0.5 mm in PBS for detachment. The cellular population underwent a proliferation crisis after 2-3 weeks, from which immortalized satellite cells arose. Under such conditions purity of satellite cells exceeded 99%. Proliferating cells were cultured for 20-25 passages at maximum. To obtain differentiation into myotubes, cells were plated at subconfluence on gelatin (0.5%, Sigma)-coated plates, maintained in GM for 24 h, and then shifted to DM differentiation medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 5% horse serum (Euroclone)). Incubation was performed at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, water-saturated atmosphere, and all media were supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin.Lentiviral Vector Production and in Vitro Transduction—High titer lentiviral vector stock was produced in 293T cells by calcium phosphate-mediated transient transfection of the modified transfer and packaging vectors pMDLg/pRRE, pRSV-Rev, and pMD2.VSVG (24Vigna E. Cavalieri S. Ailles L. Geuna M. Loew R. Bujard H. Naldini L. Mol. Ther. 2002; 5: 252-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The viral p24 antigen concentration was determined by human immunodeficiency virus-1 p24 core profile enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Ear fibroblasts (1 × 105 cells in 35-mm diameter culture dishes) from Tpr-Met responder mice were transduced with 70 ng of p24 of lentiviral vector in presence or absence of doxycycline (1 μg/ml) and Polybrene (8 μg/ml).Inhibitors, Reagents, and Antibodies—PD98059 (20 μm), SB203580 (5-20 μm), wortmannin (100 nm), and MG132 (5 μm) were added after 24 h from DM shift. All inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem. All reagents used were from FlukaChemie and Sigma. The following antibodies were used: anti-human Met (Santa Cruz, #sc-10); anti-mouse Met (Santa Cruz, #Sc-8057; Zymed Laboratories Inc., #3D4); anti-phospho-Erk-1,2 MAPK (Sigma, #M8159); anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473; Cell Signaling, #9271S); anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling; #4631); anti-α-tubulin (Sigma; #T5168); anti-desmin (Dako; #M0724); anti-GFP (Molecular Probes, #A-11122); anti-phospho-IκBα (Ser-32; Cell Signaling, #9241S); anti-Ki67 (Immunotech, #IM1920). Anti-myosin heavy chain (MyHC) MoAb (MF20) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Prat. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, and rabbit anti-mouse antibodies were from Pierce.Western Blot Analysis—Myotube cultures and muscle tissues were lysed at room temperature in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, and 2% SDS) and sonicated. For phosphoprotein analysis, myotubes were lysed at 4 °C in EB buffer (20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 160 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8, 1% Triton-X-100, protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce), and proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots were developed with Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and visualized on Amersham Biosciences Hyperfilm.Immunohistochemistry, Fiber Size Measurements, and Immunofluorescence—Either E20 embryos, P0 newborn mice, or dissected tibialis anterior muscle were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections for histological analysis (6-8 μm thick) were rehydrated and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. For immunohistochemistry, rehydrated sections were treated with 3% H2O2 and microwaved for 30 min in 10 mm Antigen Retrieval Citra (Biogenex). Sections were then incubated with primary antibody 1 h at room temperature. Incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (both 15 min room temperature) were performed using the Dako LSAB 2 system peroxidase kit. Staining was developed by liquid diaminobenzidine chromogen (Biogenex) followed by hematoxylin counterstain. For double staining experiments, after Ki-67 peroxidase staining sections were decorated with MF-20 primary antibody followed by biotinylated secondary antibody and phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin using the same kit as above. Blue staining was developed by Fast Blu chromogen (Sigma). Fiber cross-sectional areas were measured using IMAGE J software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) at 40× magnification. GFP fluorescence was monitored in living myotubes. For indirect immunofluorescence studies, myotubes differentiated on 24-well plates were fixed with methanol/acetone and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, incubated with MF20 primary antibody and then with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Sigma). Nuclei were stained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Samples were viewed under a fluorescence-equipped inverted microscope (Leica). Pictures were taken with Evolution VF color cool camera and Image-Pro software.Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy midi kit. RNA integrity was checked using RNA 6000 Nano Assay kit and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Total RNA quantification was measured by PCR and fluorogenic 5′ nuclease assay (Taqman assay). cDNAs were synthesized using Taqman reverse transcription reagents kit (Applied Biosystems). For each RNA sample a control reaction without reverse transcriptase was also run to exclude genomic contamination. 25 ng of each sample was loaded in triplicate in the optical reaction plate. Taqman PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems), Taqman probe (200 nm), and primers targeting the gene of interest (900 nm) were added to each sample. A standard curve generated from known amounts of mouse genomic DNA was used to determine the absolute quantities of each RNA. The reactions were read using the ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection instrument. The results were normalized to endogenous control (cyclophilin). The following primers and probes sequences were used: atrogin-1 forward, 5′-GTGCTTACAACTGAACATCATGCA-3′; atrogin-1 reverse, 5′-TGGCCCAGGCTGACCA-3′; atrogin-1 probe, 6FAM-TCCCGCCCGTCACTCAGCCT-TAMRA; MuRF1 forward 5′-TGTCTGGAGGTCGTTTCCG-3′; MuRF1 reverse, 5′-TGCCGGTCCATGATCACTT-3′; MuRF1 probe, 6FAM-TGCCCCTCGTGCCGCCATAMRA; cathepsin L forward, 5′-TGACACAGGGTTCGTGGATATC-3′; cathepsin L reverse, 5′-CAGTCGCCACAGCCTTCA-3′; cathepsin L probe, 6FAM-AGCAAGAGAAAGCCCT-TAMRA; cyclophilin forward, 5′-CGTGGGCTCCGTCGTC-3′; cyclophilin reverse, 5′-CCCTTCTTCTTATCGTTGGCC-3′; cyclophilin probe, 6FAM-TTGCTGCCCGGACCCTCCG-TAMRA. All probes were synthesized by Applied Biosystems.Statistics—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. or ± S.D. as indicated. Differences between the induced mice and the control groups were tested by using the χ2 test. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. A Pearson correlation coefficient was used to test the strength and relationship between variables.RESULTSGeneration of Bitransgenic Mice with Inducible Expression of Tpr-Met in Skeletal Muscle—To obtain transgenic mice in which expression of Tpr-Met can be specifically induced in muscle in a regulated manner, we adopted the Tet-on/off technology described by Gossen and Bujard (25Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar). The Tpr-Met-TRE-GFP responder construct was assembled by inserting the cDNAs of Tpr-Met and of the GFP reporter into the bidirectional plasmid pBI (Fig. 1A) (26Baron U. Freundlieb S. Gossen M. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3605-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The responder construct was validated in cell transfection experiments (27Taulli R. Accornero P. Follenzi A. Mangano T. Morotti A. Scuoppo C. Forni P.E. Bersani F. Crepaldi T. Chiarle R. Naldini L. Ponzetto C. Cancer Gene Ther. 2005; 12: 456-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and then microinjected into fertilized mouse oocytes to generate responder transgenic mice (see “Experimental Procedures”). Bitransgenic mice (MCK-tTA/Tpr-Met-TRE-GFP; Fig. 1B) were obtained by crossing the T12 line (one of the highest responders) with the transgenic activator mouse MCKtTA, expressing tTA under the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter (21Nagaraju K. Raben N. Loeffler L. Parker T. Rochon P.J. Lee E. Danning C. Wada R. Thompson C. Bahtiyar G. Craft J. Hooft V.H. Plotz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9209-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The MCK promoter is active in mouse embryos from E14 onward (28Lyons G.E. Muhlebach S. Moser A. Masood R. Paterson B.M. Buckingham M.E. Perriard J.C. Development. 1991; 113: 1017-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) when secondary myogenesis and terminal differentiation occur. Pregnant mothers were either given doxycycline (Dox) starting at the time of mating to block the responder transgene expression in the offspring (uninduced) or were left without treatment to induce its expression (Tpr-Met-induced). Fig. 1C shows E20 bitransgenic embryos, which developed in mothers kept with and without Dox (uninduced/Tpr-Met-induced). Induced bitransgenic embryos were immediately identifiable for their fluorescence and expressed Tpr-Met in their muscles (Fig. 1C, upper row and right panel). Dox administration prevented tTA induction keeping GFP and Tpr-Met at undetectable levels (Fig. 1C, lower row and right panel). The Tpr-Met-induced embryos had a characteristic “hunchback” appearance and lacked the S-shaped curvature of the vertebral column seen in control mice (Fig. 1C, middle panel). This is likely to be an indirect consequence of the strong reduction and disorganization of back muscles (Fig. 1D, left panel) that are required to support proper alignment of the vertebrae during development. As shown in Fig. 1D, middle and right panels, in Tpr-Met-induced mice the diaphragm was much thinner, and the tongue muscles were reduced with respect to controls. Induced newborn mice died perinatally, presumably due to respiratory and feeding defects.Induction of Tpr-Met in Skeletal Muscle Causes Muscle Atrophy—To better visualize the morphology of the muscle fibers, transverse sections of hindlimbs from newborn (P0) mice were stained with anti-desmin monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2A). This revealed reduced skeletal muscle masses and smaller fibers in Tpr-Met-induced mice as compared with uninduced controls. To quantitate muscle shrinkage we measured the cross-sectional areas of more than 300 fibers from Tpr-Met-induced and control mice (Fig. 2B). The mean fiber cross-sectional area of Tpr-Met-induced mice was reduced by 55% over the controls. Plotting the fiber area as frequency distributions showed a leftward shift, indicating an evident increase in the percentage of small fibers in the Tpr-Met-induced mice. To investigate the organization of individual fibers, longitudinal sections of hindlimbs were treated by Masson trichrome staining (Fig. 2C). The transverse pattern of Z-lines seen in control mice was barely detectable in Tpr-Met-induced mice, indicating that the fiber structure was highly disorganized. To verify the myosin content and the degree of proliferation, tongue transverse sections were doublestained with anti-MyHC monoclonal antibody and with anti-nuclear Ki67 rabbit antibody (Fig. 2D). In Tpr-Met-induced mice MyHC staining was decreased and was often absent in the central area of the fibers, suggesting myosin loss. The nuclei density was 10% higher in Tpr-Met induced with respect to control mice. The total number of Ki67-positive nuclei counted in whole tongue sections was similar in Tpr-Met-induced and control mice (12.100 + 350 versus 12.200 + 360), suggesting that the proliferation rate was not increased in Tpr-Met-induced mice and that the higher density of nuclei was due to muscle fiber shrinkage. Careful inspection of these sections did not yield any e"
https://openalex.org/W2103978639,"The compartmental model is a basic tool for studying signal propagation in neurons; if the model parameters are adequately redefined, it can also be helpful in the study of electrical or fluid transport in other biological systems. Here we show that the input resistance in different networks that simulate the morphology of neurons is the result of the interplay between the relevant conductances, neuron morphology, and neuron size. The results suggest that neurons may grow in such a way that facilitates the current flow to the synapses, concurrently minimizing power consumption."
