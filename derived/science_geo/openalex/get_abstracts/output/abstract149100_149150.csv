https://openalex.org/W2089963291,"Alzheimer's disease pathology is characterized by the presence of neuritic plaques and the loss of cholinergic neurons in the brain. The underlying mechanisms leading to these events are unclear, but the 42-amino acid β-amyloid peptide (Aβ1–42) is involved. Immunohistochemical studies on human sporadic Alzheimer's disease brains demonstrate that Aβ1–42 and a neuronal pentameric cation channel, the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR), are both present in neuritic plaques and co-localize in individual cortical neurons. Using human brain tissues and cells that overexpress either α7nAChR or amyloid precursor protein as the starting material, Aβ1–42 and α7nAChR can be co-immunoprecipitated by the respective specific antibodies, suggesting that they are tightly associated. The formation of the α7nAChR·Aβ1–42complex can be efficiently suppressed by Aβ12–28, implying that this Aβ sequence region contains the binding epitope. Receptor binding experiments show that Aβ1–42 and α7nAChR bind with high affinity, and this interaction can be inhibited by α7nAChR ligands. Human neuroblastoma cells overexpressing α7nAChR are readily killed by Aβ1–42, whereas α7nAChR agonists such as nicotine and epibatidine offered protection. Because Aβ1–42 inhibits α7nAChR-dependent calcium activation and acetylcholine release, two processes critically involved in memory and cognitive functions, and the distribution of α7nAChR correlates with neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease brains, we propose that interaction of the α7nAChR and Aβ1–42 is a pivotal mechanism involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease."

Here, we show that most LEA proteins are comprised in a more widespread group, which we call “hydrophilins.” The defining characteristics of hydrophilins are high glycine content (>6%) and a high hydrophilicity index (>1.0). By data base searching, we show that this criterion selectively differentiates most known LEA proteins as well as additional proteins from different taxons. We found that within the genomes of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, only 5 and 12 proteins, respectively, meet our criterion. Despite their deceivingly loose definition, hydrophilins usually represent <0.2% of the proteins of a genome. Additionally, we demonstrate that the criterion that defines hydrophilins seems to be an excellent predictor of responsiveness to hyperosmosis since most of the genes encoding these proteins in E. coli and S. cerevisiae are induced by osmotic stress. Evidence for the participation of one of the E. coli hydrophilins in the adaptive response to hyperosmotic conditions is presented. Apparently, hydrophilins represent analogous adaptations to a common problem in such diverse taxons as prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

Water stress may affect all types of organisms at some stage of their life cycle. We aimed at addressing if similar proteins have been recruited during evolution to respond to water-deficit conditions. Hydrophilic proteins known as late embryogenesis abundant (LEA)1 proteins accumulate under conditions of extreme desiccation in higher plants. These proteins accumulate to high levels during the last stage of seed formation (when a natural desiccation of the seed tissues takes place) and during periods of water deficit in vegetative organs (1.Bray E.A. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 48-54Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). LEA proteins have been grouped into at least six families on the basis of sequence similarity (2.Colmenero-Flores J.M. Campos F. Garciarrubio A. Covarrubias A.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 3.Ingram J. Bartels D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 377-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar). Although significant similarity has not been detected between the members of the different classes, a unifying and outstanding feature of these proteins is their high hydrophilicity and high percentage of glycines (4.Baker J. Steele C. Dure III, L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 11: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 5.Dure III, L. Close T.J. Bray E.A. Plant Responses to Cellular Dehydration during Environmental Stress. 10. American Society of Plant Physiology, Rockville, MD1993: 91-103Google Scholar, 6.Dure III, L. Plant J. 1993; 3: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis allows one to predict that these proteins exist primarily as random coils (5.Dure III, L. Close T.J. Bray E.A. Plant Responses to Cellular Dehydration during Environmental Stress. 10. American Society of Plant Physiology, Rockville, MD1993: 91-103Google Scholar). This property has been confirmed in few cases with purified proteins (7.Lisse T. Bartels D. Kalbitzer H.R. Jaenicke R. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 555-561PubMed Google Scholar, 8.McCubbin W.D. Kay C.M. Can. J. Biochem. 1985; 63: 803-810Google Scholar) and is supported by the fact that proteins of this type do not coagulate upon heating (9.Close T.J. Lambert P.J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1993; 101: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10.Close T.J. Physiol. Plant. 1996; 97: 795-803Crossref Google Scholar). LEA protein families have been identified in a wide range of different plant species to the extent that they can be considered ubiquitous in plants (3.Ingram J. Bartels D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 377-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar, 11.Close T.J. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 291-296Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that members of at least one of the LEA protein families, the so-called dehydrins, are present in a range of photosynthetic organisms, including lower plants, algae, and cyanobacteria (9.Close T.J. Lambert P.J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1993; 101: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11.Close T.J. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 291-296Crossref Google Scholar). Two important questions to address are, how do these structural and physicochemical characteristics relate to the largely unknown function of LEA proteins and do they represent a solution to a plant-specific problem or to a more general one? Recent data suggest that LEA-like proteins are also found in fungi, and they seem to be also involved in pathways that respond to water deficit. That is the case ofHSP12 (12.Mtwisha L. Brandt W. McCready S. Lindsey G.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and GRE1 (13.Garay-Arroyo A. Covarrubias A.A. Yeast. 1999; 15: 879-892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whose amino acid composition shows a high content of hydrophilic amino acids distributed throughout their primary structure. In both cases, it has been shown that their corresponding transcripts accumulate in response to hyperosmosis (13.Garay-Arroyo A. Covarrubias A.A. Yeast. 1999; 15: 879-892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Varela J.C. van Beekvelt C. Planta R.J. Mager W.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2183-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). TheCON6-encoded protein of Neurospora crassa also exhibits hydrophilic and highly charged repeated domains. The CON6 polypeptide is present at high levels in the late stages of conidiation and in the mature conidia, stages that involve nutrient deprivation and developmentally imposed desiccation (15.Springer M.L. Yanofsky C. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1052-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Since the LEA proteins of different classes have no evident sequence similarity, it is unlikely that the structural and physicochemical characteristics they share are due to common descent. In contrast, it seems that these physicochemical characteristics have evolved independently in different protein families and in different organisms, and they allow LEA proteins to carry out their specific functions under partial dehydration. If this is the case, we should expect to find proteins with similar characteristics outside the plant kingdom that are also induced by conditions of water deficit. We have chosen the name hydrophilins to group the proteins that present, as most LEA proteins in plants, extreme hydrophilicity and a high percentage of glycine residues in their sequence. In this study, we explored the question of whether proteins with these characteristics are widespread among bacteria and other eukaryotes and if they are induced by water deficit. To pursue this objective, we designed an algorithm to search sequence data bases for proteins having a physicochemical resemblance to LEA proteins. Then we investigated, either from the literature or by performing Northern blot experiments, whether the transcripts of the selected genes accumulated under water deficit. After finding isolated examples in several species, we searched the complete genome data bases of Escherichia coliand S. cerevisiae. A surprisingly high proportion of the proteins chosen by the physicochemical criterion was also induced at the mRNA level under water-deficit conditions. Thus, we conclude that hydrophilins exist in several kingdoms, including plant, bacteria, and fungi, and that they have been recruited from diverse protein families to pathways involved in responses to water-deficit conditions. S. cerevisiae strain RS58 (16.Gaxiola R. Larrinoa I.F. Villalba J.M. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3157-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) was used in this work. Yeast cells were routinely grown on medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% glucose at 30 °C. The stress treatment involved a 30-min osmotic shock imposed by adding a final concentration of 0.5 m sorbitol to a yeast culture grown up toA 660 = 0.5. For E. coli, most of the experiments were carried out using strain DH5α. E. colicells were routinely grown on LB medium (1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) at 37 °C. As in the case of yeast cells, an osmotic shock was imposed on bacterial cultures grown up toA 600 = 0.5 by the addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 0.4 m, and cells were harvested after 10, 20, and 60 min of shock treatment. E. coli strain W3110 and its derivative, HMY15, carrying anrmf::Cmr mutation, were kindly provided by Dr. A. Ishihama (17.Yamagishi M. Matsushima H. Wada A. Sakagami M. Fujita N. Ishihama A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Osmosensitivity tests were performed by growing E. coli strains in liquid LB medium with or without 0.5 m NaCl at 37 °C. Samples were removed at the times indicated, and their A 600 values were determined. Strain HMY15 was grown in the presence of chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml). Levels of survival were obtained by exposing log-phase bacterial cultures to osmotic shock with 0.5 m NaCl for 30 and 60 min. After serial dilutions, viable cells were estimated by colony counting. Mean survival is expressed as percentage of the survival obtained in cultures not exposed to osmotic shock. All full-length hydrophilin genes were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of chromosomal DNA. The primers used to obtain E. coli and S. cerevisiae hydrophilin gene probes are listed in TableI. The purified polymerase chain reaction products were used as probes for all Northern blot experiments.Table IPrimers used to obtain E. coli and S. cerevisiae hydrophilin gene probesNameSequence (5′ to 3′)YCIG_ECOLIATG CAA CGC AAC GGG AGA AAT AACGCG AGT TTT GCC AGT GCC CGG GYJBJ_ECOLICTG AAT AAA TAA TCC TAA GCCGAA ACC GCG TTA AGA GGG CGPRTL_ECOLIGAA CTT CCC AAC GAA TCC GCCGA TGG TGG TGG GGG AAG GRMF_ECOLICCG TCT CCG GTA TGT TGC CCAG ACA GAG TAT CAA AAG GCGYHDL_ECOLIATG AGT CGA TAT CAG CAT ACT AAA GGGCT GAA AGA GCA GAA TAA CCG CS65242CTC GAG GCC AAA CAC TAC CGC ATA AAA GCCTC GAG CAA ACT GAC ATT AAT AAA AAC GSTF2_YEASTAAT CAA CAG TAA CAA ACC GCCCT TTT ATC TTG AAA CTG TGCYBM6_YEASTATG TCT GCT AAC GAT TAC TAC GGC GGGAA AGG CAA CTG CAA AGA ACA GAA GGG GYFBO_YEASTTTC GTC CAC CTG ACC GAG CCG GCCCG TCA AAT CCA TCA TCA AAT CCIF1A_YEASTATG GGT AAG AAA AAC ACT AAA GGT GGGAT ATT GAG GAC ACT TGT TCG GCCS67772GGA AAA AGA CCC AAC AGT GCA GCC GGGGA TGA ATT CCT GCA GGA ACA GGCYJO4_YEASTCAA GAA GAA GAT GTT AAG GAG GGCGT TAC AAC CCC GAA CCC GTG CGYJS4_YEASTGCC GAT AGT GCA CTG GAA CCCAA TCC TTC TTA ACT GTA TCC CYNTO_YEASTATG AAG TTC TCT TCT GTT ACT GCCAG GAT GAA GGG GGT AGG GGG GGRL44_YEASTTCC TGA ATC GTA GGG CAA ATC CAAT TGC AAA GCT TGA CCC TTT TGC Open table in a new tab E. coli and S. cerevisiae RNAs were extracted following standard procedures (18.Collart M.

To remove the remaining transfer RNA, an additional precipitation step using LiCl to a final concentration of 2.0 m was included. After centrifugation, the RNA pellet was washed twice with 70% ethanol and resuspended in water (13.Garay-Arroyo A. Covarrubias A.A. Yeast. 1999; 15: 879-892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For all Northern blot experiments, 10 μg of total RNA was separated by electrophoresis on formaldehyde-containing 1.2% agarose gel and blotted onto nylon N+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All hybridizations were carried out under high stringency conditions (65 °C and 300 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 7% SDS, and 10 mm EDTA) (19.Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). To search the protein data bases, anad hoc program written in Perl was used. For each sequence, the program records the amino acid composition and performs a hydrophilicity analysis based on the algorithm of Kyte and Doolittle (20.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17289) Google Scholar), using a window size of 12 residues. The program's output is a list, sorted according to a given score, of the sequences that passed the selection criterion. The selection criterion and the scoring function can be given separately to the program at runtime. Throughout this work, the selection criterion was an average hydrophilicity above 1 and at least 8% Gly; the score or index of significance was defined as shown in Equation 1. 100×(%Gly−8)×(average hydrophilicity−1)Equation 1 After trying different combinations of several structural and physicochemical features common to LEA proteins, this criterion was chosen because it is simple and can adequately discriminate between LEA proteins and other plant proteins. The score function was chosen to give zero at the threshold values and to grow larger as a protein becomes more distinguishable from the bulk of the non-LEA proteins. Different sequence sets were used in this study. To develop the selection criterion and to assess its adequacy, we used a control set that includes almost all known LEA proteins, 56 sequences in total. All other sets were derived from the Swiss Protein Database (Release 36). Sequences recorded as fragments and those shorter than 30 residues were not used. To find new hydrophilins, we used different taxon-specific subsets of the Swiss Protein Database. Classification into taxons was made by the Fetch program of the Wisconsin software package (Version 9.1, Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). The groups considered were plant, bacteria (excluding E. coli), fungi (excludingS. cerevisiae), E. coli, and S. cerevisiae. In the case of E. coli and S. cerevisiae, searches were performed over hypothetically translated open reading frames of the corresponding complete genomes (E. coli K12 MG1655 complete genome, Release M52, GenBankTM accession number U00096; S. cerevisiaeGenome Database, Release 4.1). Three-state secondary structure prediction was performed by the PHD sec service of the PredictProtein Server. 2The computer program and the sequences in the control set are available from the authors. LEA proteins did not evolve from a single ancestral protein, but they can be grouped based on physicochemical features, mainly high glycine content and a large proportion of charged residues. LEA proteins also have characteristic hydropathy profiles, which distinguish them from other proteins (TableII). We used these distinctive traits to design a reliable method to retrieve LEA-like non-plant proteins from data bases. The search criterion was established by searching a control set, including most known LEA proteins sequences and the plant subset of the Swiss Protein Database, with an ad hoc program (see “Experimental Procedures”) that considers only glycine content and average hydrophilicity, two properties that resulted in a high selectivity for LEA proteins (Fig. 1). Proteins with an average hydrophilicity above 1 and at least 8% glycine content were retained. We coined the name “hydrophilins” to group the proteins retrieved based on this criterion (Fig. 1). In addition to these fixed thresholds, the algorithm assigned a score to the searched proteins, which allowed us to sort them by their significance. The score, or index of significance, defined in Equation1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) has the properties of being zero at the threshold values and of becoming larger as a protein moves away from the bulk of the non-LEA proteins (Fig. 1).Table IICharacteristics of the hydrophilins found in different organismsThe protein hydropathy profiles were obtained using MacMolly's Translate package.

(Bethesda). 1993; 101: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For this reason, they were excluded from the control set of LEA proteins (Fig.1). That our search criterion is specific is further confirmed by the fact that of 5792 plant proteins searched, only 72 were selected, and 52 of these are known LEA proteins (Fig. 1). Additional hydrophilins were identified: two LEA proteins not previously considered, two of the so-called COR proteins, a flocculent-active protein (MO2), a seed antimicrobial peptide (MBP1), and several ribosomal proteins (14.Varela J.C. van Beekvelt C. Planta R.J. Mager W.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2183-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some of these proteins have been associated with water-deficit situations. This is the case of the alfalfa COR410 and wheat CORA proteins, which not only present sequence similarity to some LEA proteins, but also their genes are induced during cold and drought stress (22.Danyluk J. Houde M. Rassart E. Sarhan F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23.Laberge S. Castonguay Y. Vezina L.P. Plant Physiol.

Acta. 1995; 1243: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Regarding the ribosomal proteins, no information is available on their expression patterns under stress conditions (Swiss-Prot accession numbers p10851, p50888, p49195, p26871, p27083, p50892, p27070, p48857, p49213, p48130, p51190, p49164, p49689, and p28520). When the same analysis was performed with the fungal and bacterial protein subsets (excluding S. cerevisiae and E. coli; see below), again a discrete group of proteins were classified as hydrophilins according to our criterion. In fungi, only 12 out of 2264 sequences passed the selection criterion. This group included two proteins, CON6 and CON10, involved in conidiation (a developmental stage at which a dehydration process occurs) (26.Roberts A.N. Berlin V. Hager K.M. Yanofsky C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2411-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27.White B.T. Yanofsky C. Dev.

In bacteria, 14 hydrophilin candidates out of 12,911 sequences were selected. Three of them are involved inBacillus subtilis sporulation (GsiB, SspF, and CotT), and specifically, GsiB is also induced in response to different stress conditions, including osmotic stress (29.Aronson A.I.

From the remaining 11 hydrophilins, seven correspond to hypothetical proteins, and two are classified as single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (Swiss-Prot accession numbers p40947 and p44409) and two as ribosomal proteins (Swiss-Prot accession numbers p52829 and p46386).

https://openalex.org/W2108345134,"The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) promotes adipocyte differentiation, exerts atherogenic and anti-inflammatory effects in monocyte/macrophages, and is believed to mediate the insulin-sensitizing action of antidiabetic thiazolidinedione ligands. As no complete PPARγ antagonists have been described hitherto, we have constructed a dominant-negative mutant receptor to inhibit wild-type PPARγ action. Highly conserved hydrophobic and charged residues (Leu<sup>468</sup> and Glu<sup>471</sup>) in helix 12 of the ligand-binding domain were mutated to alanine. This compound PPARγ mutant retains ligand and DNA binding, but exhibits markedly reduced transactivation due to impaired coactivator (cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein and steroid receptor coactivator-1) recruitment. Unexpectedly, the mutant receptor silences basal gene transcription, recruits corepressors (the silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors and the nuclear corepressor) more avidly than wild-type PPARγ, and exhibits delayed ligand-dependent corepressor release. It is a powerful dominant-negative inhibitor of cotransfected wild-type receptor action. Furthermore, when expressed in primary human preadipocytes using a recombinant adenovirus, this PPARγ mutant blocks thiazolidinedione-induced differentiation, providing direct evidence that PPARγ mediates adipogenesis. Our observations suggest that, as in other mutant nuclear receptor contexts (acute promyelocytic leukemia, resistance to thyroid hormone), dominant-negative inhibition by PPARγ is linked to aberrant corepressor interaction. Adenoviral expression of this mutant receptor is a valuable means to antagonize PPARγ signaling."

MBP-1 binds to the c-myc P2 promoter and down-regulates c-myc expression. We have investigated the role of α-enolase in regulation of the c-mycprotooncogene. RNase protection assay shows that α-enolase is transcribed into a single RNA species in HeLa cells.

Regulation of c-myc gene expression is quite complex and involves several mechanisms, including changes in transcription initiation and elongation, RNA stability and turnover, and translation (3.Bentley D.L.

The Myc-binding protein-1 (MBP-1)1 is a 37-kDa human c-myc promoter-binding protein that binds in a region +123 to +153 relative to the c-myc P2 promoter (11.Ray R. Miller D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). MBP-1 is a negative regulator of c-myc expression and binds in the minor groove of the c-myc P2 promoter simultaneously with the TATA-binding protein (12.Chaudhary D. Miller D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3438-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Consistent with its negative regulation of c-myc and as a potential tumor suppresser protein, transfection of human breast carcinoma cells with MBP-1 cDNA results in inhibition of tumor formation in nude mice (13.Ray R.B.

Exogenous expression of MBP-1 has been suggested to play an important role in the regulation of human immunodeficiency virus-1 replication in infected cells (14.Ray R.B. Srinivas R.V. J. Cell.

Enolase is the glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the formation of phosphoenolpyruvate from 2-phosphoglycerate, the second of the two high energy intermediates that generate ATP in glycolysis (16.Wold F. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 5. Academic Press, New York1971: 499-508Google Scholar). The MBP-1 cDNA shares sequence homology with the α-enolase cDNA, which encodes a 1.8-kb mRNA and a polypeptide of about 48 kDa. The high degree of sequence homology is confined to the 1.4-kb 3′ region of α-enolase and the full-length 1.4-kb MBP-1 and suggests that α-enolase and MBP-1 are both products of the α-enolase gene.2 The presence of an ATG start codon followed by the Kozak sequence suggests that MBP-1 may be the product of alternate translation initiation from an in frame internal translation initiation site 400 bp downstream on the α-enolase cDNA (Fig.1 A). Western blot analysis using an antibody specific to non-neuronal enolase from human brain (Biogenesis) has identified both 48- and 37-kDa proteins in HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig.1 B). The cellular localization of α-enolase is known to be predominantly cytosolic. The function of MBP-1 as a down-regulator of c-myc gene expression suggests that it would be localized in the nucleus. HeLa cell extract made using Promega reporter lysis buffer (prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures”) is primarily cytosolic and does not show the presence of MBP-1. The presence of MBP-1 in nuclear extracts corroborates with its role in down-regulation of c-myc promoter activity. α-Enolase constructs are able to down-regulate c-myc promoter activity, albeit to a lower extent than MBP-1.2 On the other hand, preliminary experiments indicate that MBP-1 does not have enolase enzyme activity. 3A. Subramanian, J. O. Trent, and D. M. Miller, unpublished data. 3A. Subramanian, J. O. Trent, and D. M. Miller, unpublished data.Here we have studied the structure-function relationship of α-enolase as a negative regulator of c-myc activity using DNA binding studies and transfection assays. Our results suggest that the c-myc down-regulating activity of α-enolase lies in the N-terminal region of the protein also present in the alternative translation initiation product MBP-1. The α-enolase fragment from 181 to 600, containing the MBP-1 start site, was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the pBluescript II SK vector (Stratagene). In order to make an antisense RNA probe, the vector containing the 420-base pair α-enolase fragment was linearized with XhoI and in vitro transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]CTP, using a Maxiscript T3 kit (Ambion). Labeled probe was purified on 5% acrylamide, 8 m urea denaturing gel and eluted overnight at 37 °C. RNase protection assay was carried out using the RPA II kit (Ambion). The antisense cRNA probe (1 × 106 cpm) was hybridized overnight at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of HeLa cell RNA and then digested with RNase A (0.5 units) and RNase T1 (20 units) for 30 min at 37 °C. Hybridization was also performed with in vitro transcribed α-enolase and MBP-1 RNA as controls. Following ethanol precipitation, protected fragments were separated on a 6% acrylamide, 8 murea denaturing gel. The sizes of the protected fragment were determined by running a labeled Century RNA marker (Ambion) alongside. The N-terminal truncations of α-enolase were generated by PCR using upstream primers that contained the start codon. Downstream primers containing the stop codon were used to PCR-amplify the C-terminal deletions. The PCR products were then cloned directly into the PCR 2.1 vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). From PCR 2.1, they were excised and cloned directionally into the pCITE (Novagen) and pBluescript (Stratagene) vectors under control of the T7 promoter. The full-length α-enolase cDNA was also cloned into these vectors. The pCITE clones were used for in vitro transcription and translation, while the pBluescript clones were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells. For transfection assays, the α-enolase cDNA and its deletion mutants were cloned into the pBKCMV vector (Stratagene) under control of the CMV promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene. Full-length α-enolase cloned into the pCITE vector was used as the template for mutagenesis of the MBP-1 ATG. Two oligonucleotide primers, each complementary to the opposite strands of the vector, and containing a G→C mutation were designed and extended by PCR following the manufacturer's instructions. After incubating the PCR products withDpnI to digest dam-methylated E. coliDNA, the plasmid was transformed into competent cells. To make two G→C mutations, α-enolase DNA containing the first mutation was used as the template with a new set of primers containing the second mutation. The plasmid DNA obtained from the cells was sequenced to determine the presence of the mutations. The point-mutated α-enolase in the pCITE vector under control of the T7 promoter were linearized with XhoI downstream of the insert and used for in vitro transcription and translation. The point-mutated α-enolase DNAs were also cloned into the pBKCMV vector for transient transfection assays. The pCITE vector containing the full-length and truncated α-enolase cDNA under control of the T7 promoter was linearized at the XhoI site downstream of the coding sequence. RNA was generated by in vitro transcription using the MEGAscript system (Ambion). RNA transcripts were quantified by absorbance at 260 nm and ethidium bromide staining on an agarose gel allowed verification of their integrity. In vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Red Nova lysate from Novagen) was performed as per instructions. Translation reactions were performed with [35S]methionine, and the in vitro translated products were analyzed directly by electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. This procedure was also followed for the point mutants of α-enolase generated by site-directed mutagenesis. EMSA was performed as described previously with some modification (17.Kim C. Snyder R.O. Wold M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3050-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Full-length α-enolase and its deletion mutants cloned into the pBluescript vector were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induced as described previously (11.Ray R. Miller D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The induced proteins were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Coomassie staining. The 45-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide (GGAGGGATCGCGCT G AGTATAAAAGCCGGTTTTCGGGGCTTTATC) corresponding to the P2 promoter region of c-myc was32P-labeled and used as probe. The underlined G in the above sequence was mutated to T, and this mutant c-myc probe was used as unlabeled competitor. 15 μg of the extracts prepared from the induced cultures were incubated with the probe (2 ng, 104 cpm) in the EMSA buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2 and 6% glycerol) in the presence of 2 mg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) on ice for 30 min. Unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide or 2 μl of antibody (1 μg/μl) were incubated with the protein for 30 min on ice before addition of the labeled oligonucleotide. The resulting complexes were then separated on a native 5% polyacrylamide gel at room temperature in 1× Tris borate-EDTA at 10 V/cm. After electrophoresis, gel retardation was visualized by autoradiography. The HeLa human cervical carcinoma cell line was stably transfected with the luciferase reporter gene under control of the c-myc P2 promoter. These stably transfected cells were called MYC1 cells. All transient transfection assays were performed in MYC1 cells. MYC1 cells were plated at an initial density of 5 × 104 cells/well of a 24-well plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Immediately prior to transfection, cells were washed three times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Transient transfection of the MYC1 cells with pBKCMV clones of full-length α-enolase and its mutants was carried out using the lipid DOTAP/DOPE method. To normalize the transfection efficiency, the SV40-based β-galactosidase expression plasmid (SV40-β-gal) was co-transfected. To transfect one well, 8 μg of DOTAP/DOPE (1 μg/μl) was mixed with 1 μg of each vector and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The liposome/DNA complexes were mixed with 500 μl of serum free media and added to each well. Plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum was then added, and cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cell extracts were made by lysing the cells in each well of a 24-well plate with 100 μl of freshly diluted 1× Reporter lysis buffer (Promega, selected for its low background in protein assays), which allows extracts to be used for Western blot analysis, luciferase, and β-galactosidase assays. Lysis was performed for 30 min at room temperature with rocking. Lysate was transferred to a 1.5-ml polypropylene tube and centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 4 min to pellet cell debris. The HeLa cell extracts prepared in this manner are primarily cytoplasmic with minimal or no nuclear material. Supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and protein concentration determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad). Cell extracts were assayed for both β-galactosidase and luciferase activity at 24 h after transfection. 50 μl of extract was added to 100 μl of luciferase assay substrate (Promega) in a clear 12 × 75-mm polystyrene tube. Samples were read immediately on a luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) and light production (relative light units) measured for 10 s. Each value of luciferase activity is normalized against β-galactosidase and represents the mean ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. Cell extracts were made as described above from the MYC1 cells transfected with the pBKCMV expression vectors encoding full-length α-enolase or its mutants under control of the CMV promoter and analyzed by Western blot analysis. The proteins were electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) membrane by electroblotting overnight (15 V). The α-enolase proteins were detected using an antibody specific to non-neuronal enolase from human brain raised in sheep as a host (Biogenesis) and a chemiluminescence kit (ECL detection, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HeLa whole cell and nuclear extracts containing 5 μg of protein were also analyzed by Western blot analysis. RNA was isolated from the transiently transfected MYC1 cells and analyzed for levels of expression of message from the transfected constructs by Northern hybridization. The probe was the 1.8-kb full-length α-enolase cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C overnight in 5 ml of formamide and 100 μl of denatured salmon sperm DNA. Filters were washed at moderate stringency (0.1× SSC, 1% SDS, 42 °C) and exposed to x-ray film overnight. Although we have hypothesized that MBP-1 and α-enolase are alternate translation products of a single α-enolase mRNA, it is important to document this fact. RNase protection assay was used to analyze expression of the α-enolase transcript. A cRNA antisense probe of 420 nucleotides corresponding to nucleotides 181–600 of α-enolase, containing the MBP-1 start site at position 386, was synthesized together with Century RNA markers (Ambion). The radiolabeled cRNA probe was hybridized to total RNA derived from HeLa cells and to in vitrotranscribed α-enolase and MBP-1 RNA as control (Fig.2). In total HeLa cell RNA, a 420-nucleotide fragment was protected corresponding to the fragment observed in the in vitro transcribed α-enolase mRNA control lane. The MBP-1 control RNA protected a 220-nucleotide fragment that was not seen in the HeLa cell RNA. These data confirm our hypothesis that expression of the α-enolase gene gives rise to a single transcript and that an MBP-1-specific mRNA is not transcribed. This would also indicate that MBP-1 is not a product of alternative RNA splicing. In order to confirm that MBP-1 is a product of translation initiation from an internal ATG on the α-enolase cDNA, site-directed mutagenesis was performed (Fig. 3 A). The ATG codon for methionine at position 97 of α-enolase was transformed into the ATC codon for isoleucine (Enomut1). This mutation failed to abolish translation of the MBP-1 protein from the α-enolase cDNA. This may have been due to the presence of another in frame ATG at position 377 of α-enolase, six bases upstream of the first ATG, coding for methionine 94, which could have been used for translation. After mutating methionine 94 to isoleucine (Enomut2), a 37-kDa MBP-1 protein band was still visible. Site-directed mutagenesis at both positions was performed on the same template DNA and the resulting α-enolase cDNA (Enomut3) translated into a single protein of 48 kDa (Fig. 3 B). In order to determine if the α-enolase protein could down-regulate c-myc promoter activity in the absence of MBP-1 translation, Enomut3 cloned under control of the CMV promoter was used in transient transfection assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Extracts from the MYC1-transfected cells were analyzed by Western blot, and similar levels of protein were observed (Fig. 3 C). Luciferase assay results show that, although full-length α-enolase down-regulates c-myc promoter activity by about 40%, Enomut3, which does not generate MBP-1 on translation, is able to repress it by less than 20% (Fig. 4). This indicates that the c-myc down-regulating activity of α-enolase lies in the alternative translation product MBP-1. We have demonstrated that α-enolase has c-myc down-regulation activity, although less significant than MBP-1. In order to map the functional domains of α-enolase, a series of N and C-terminal deletion mutants were made. The set of α-enolase mutants generated is summarized in Fig.5 A. Each mutant was named for the amino acids deleted; for example, EnoΔ1–236 has amino acids 1–236 deleted. EnoΔ1–96 is MBP-1. The expression plasmids were tested for their ability to express full-length α-enolase and its deletion mutants. All the expression plasmids generated polypeptides of the appropriate size after in vitro transcription and translation (Fig. 5 B). The C-terminal truncations EnoΔ242–434 and Eno Δ373–434 also generated smaller peptides of 15 and 26 kDa, respectively, due to translation from the internal initiation site. The 15-kDa band is not visible in Fig. 5 B, as it ran with the dye front on the gel. It has been shown previously that MBP-1 binds to the c-myc P2 promoter (11.Ray R. Miller D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed with a 50-base pair labeled c-myc probe (see “Experimental procedures”) and lysates from induced BL21(DE3) cells expressing α-enolase and its deletion mutants. The in vitro translated full-length and truncated α-enolase proteins were initially used for gel shift analysis. However, addition of any of the in vitrotranslated proteins to the 50-base pair labeled c-mycoligonucleotide caused a shift to the same extent in every lane. We soon realized that endogenous enolase from Rabbit reticulocyte lysate (in which the in vitro translation is carried out) interfered with the EMSA. In order to get around the problem of interference from endogenous α-enolase, bacterially expressed proteins were made and used in EMSAs. The crude bacterial extracts, when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie-stained, indicated the presence of the translation products from full-length α-enolase and its deletion mutants. However, the smaller peptides due to translation from the internal initiation site on the C-terminal deletions, EnoΔ242–434 and EnoΔ373–434, were not observed (data not shown). A specific DNA-protein complex was visualized by autoradiography in all the α-enolase deletion mutants except EnoΔ1–236. The visible DNA-protein complexes were not disrupted upon addition of 100-fold molar excess of a mutant cold competitor (Fig. 6 A). The unlabeled oligonucleotide used as competitor has been described previously (11.Ray R. Miller D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and has a mutation that prevents binding of MBP-1 to the DNA. A polyclonal α-enolase antibody was able to bind to and supershift the DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 6 B). An antibody to human c-myc was unable to supershift the full-length α-enolase-DNA complex, indicating that the supershifts obtained using the α-enolase antibody are specific. Deletion of amino acids 1–236 of α-enolase prevents the protein from binding to the c-myc P2 promoter. These results indicate that the DNA binding region of the α-enolase protein lies between amino acids 96 and 236. MBP-1 has been shown to down-regulate c-myc promoter activity (11.Ray R. Miller D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). HeLa cells stably transfected with the luciferase reporter gene under control of the c-mycpromoter (MYC1 cells) were transiently transfected with α-enolase and its deletions under control of the CMV promoter. Northern and Western blot analysis confirmed expression of the mutated forms of α-enolase in the transfected cells (Fig. 7,A and B). Similar levels of RNA were expressed from α-enolase and its truncations in the MYC1 cells. Levels of protein expression from α-enolase and its deletion mutants were quantified by densitometry and found to be comparable. The shorter peptide of 26 kDa translated from the internal initiation site of the C-terminal deletions EnoΔ373–434 is also generated upon transfection into MYC1 cells and can be seen in Fig. 7 B. The 15-kDa peptide generated by translation initiation from the internal ATG on EnoΔ242–434, which ran along with the dye front on the SDS gel, is not shown in Fig. 7 B. However, the amount of protein translated from the internal ATG is far less than that from the first ATG of these constructs. Hence, the effect observed on c-mycpromoter activity in transient transfection assays is thought to be predominantly due to the larger proteins. The effect of α-enolase and its deletion mutants on c-mycpromoter activity were measured as luciferase activities in transfected MYC1 cells. The results indicate that EnoΔ1–236 does not down-regulate c-myc promoter activity as efficiently as full-length α-enolase (Fig. 8). The MBP-1 protein down-regulates c-myc promoter activity by 65%. These results correspond with the EMSA results and show that the DNA binding and c-myc down-regulating activity of α-enolase lies between amino acids 96 and 236. The role of α-enolase as a glycolytic enzyme has been very well characterized. The α-enolase gene is transcribed into a single RNA species, as proven by the RNase protection assay. Here we show that at least two proteins arise from the alternative usage of translation initiation sites present on the α-enolase mRNA. MBP-1, which negatively regulates c-myc promoter activity, was initially identified from a human cervical carcinoma cell expression library. Previous work (13.Ray R.B. Steele R. Seftor E. Hendrix M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3747-3751PubMed Google Scholar) has demonstrated that this alternate translation product of the α-enolase gene acts as a tumor suppresser when transfected into human breast carcinoma cells, largely preventing anchorage-independent growth and the growth of tumors in nude mice. We examined the MBP-1 and α-enolase cDNA coding sequences and observed complete sequence homology between the MBP-1 sequence and the 1.4-kb 3′ region of α-enolase. A potential translation initiation site at codon 97 of α-enolase was observed, and the sequence surrounding this ATG triplet exhibits an overall sequence homology to the Kozak consensus cassette (18.Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar). In a construct in which the ATG at codon 97 on the α-enolase cDNA was mutated to ATC (Enomut1), MBP-1 translation was not abolished. Another in-frame ATG at codon 94 was observed and, after mutation of this ATG to generate Enomut2, α-enolase and MBP-1 continued to be translated. However, when both the ATGs were mutated (Enomut3), α-enolase was the sole product of translation. Because Enomut3 gives rise to just the 48-kDa α-enolase, we can exclude the possibility that MBP-1 arises from proteolytic cleavage of the complete protein. Western blot analysis of pure human α-enolase shows the presence of a single band of ∼48 kDa. Even after incubation of the pure human α-enolase protein in a transcription/translation system, no smaller fragment the size of MBP-1 could be observed by Western blotting (data not shown). Full-length α-enolase cDNA after in vitrotranscription/translation gives rise to both α-enolase and MBP-1 protein bands. The ratio of these two proteins remains constant when checked on a gel after storage for a considerable period of time. These results further confirm that MBP-1 is not a product of proteolytic cleavage of α-enolase. The single α-enolase mRNA is alternatively translated from methionine 94 or 97 to yield MBP-1. Our data do not allow us to distinguish whether MBP-1 is translated from the codon for methionine at position 94 or 97 on the α-enolase mRNA. Of the two isoforms of α-enolase, MBP-1 better down-regulates c-myc promoter activity. In transient transfection assays in HeLa cells, α-enolase is unable to down-regulate activity of the c-myc promoter efficiently after mutation of the internal translation initiation site to prevent translation of MBP-1. The ∼20% down-regulation of c-myc promoter activity observed after transfection with Enomut3 is due to the binding of the full-length α-enolase to the c-myc P2 promoter. These results suggest that the α-enolase gene is bifunctional, encoding two proteins, one of which has a role in glycolysis and the other in regulation of c-myc expression. Evidence to suggest that α-enolase may have functions other than as a glycolytic enzyme has been generated earlier in yeast, other vertebrates, and mammalian cells (19.Cooper J.A. Reiss N.A. Schwartz R.J. Hunter T. Nature. 1983; 302: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 20.Graven K.K. Zimmerman L.H. Dickson E.W. Weinhouse G.L. Farber H.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These include either a direct function or indirect role in processes such as thermal tolerance, growth control, and hypoxia tolerance (21.Aaronson R.M. Graven K.K. Tucci M. McDonald R.T. Farber H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27752-27757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A structural role in the lens of some species has been exhibited by α-enolase (22.Wistow G.J. Lietman T. Williams L.A. Stapel S.O. de Jong W.N. Horwotz J. Piatigorsky J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2729-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It also functions as a cell surface receptor for plasminogen, resulting in enhanced plasminogen activation and localization of the proteolytic activity of plasmin on cell surfaces (23.Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plesia J. Felez J. Kato K. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The presence of α-enolase on the surface of pathogenic streptococci has recently been demonstrated (24.Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14503-14515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The streptococcal surface enolase is thought to play an important role in the disease process and in post-streptococcal autoimmune diseases. Our results demonstrate that MBP-1 is a product of internal translation initiation from the α-enolase gene. Internal initiation has been described for other genes such as those for C/EBP α and β (25.Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), Myc (26.Hann S.H. Dixit M. Sears R.C. Sealy L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2441-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), GATA-1 (27.Calligaris R. Bottardi S. Cogoi S. Apeztegria I. Santoro C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1990; 344: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), and appears to be an efficient and rapid means to modulate their activity. Moreover, in most of the reported cases, this mechanism is evolutionarily preserved in rodents and humans. It has been observed that the in-frame internal ATGs at codons 94 and 97 of α-enolase are conserved across the human, rat, mouse, chicken, duck, and frog α-enolase sequence (31.Segil N. Shrutkowski A. Dworkin M.B. Dworkin-Rastl E. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32.Kaghad M. Dumont X. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Lamande N. Lucas M. Lazar M. Caput D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33.Hedges S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The two GATA-1 isoforms share identical binding activity but differ in their transactivation potential and in their expression in developing mouse embryos. The 30-kDa protein generated by alternative translation initiation of C/EBPα (42 kDa) lacks antimitotic activity (35.Lin F.T. Macdougald O.A. Diehl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Although there are numerous examples of alternative translation products, the broad disparity of function between α-enolase and MBP-1 appears to be unique. Our preliminary observations indicate that MBP-1 lacks α-enolase enzyme activity.3 Although the cellular localization for the α-enolase protein has been thought to be predominantly cytosolic, the presence of MBP-1 is observed only in the nuclear extract from HeLa cells. The functional significance of this may lie in the negative regulation of expression of the c-myc protooncogene by the MBP-1 isoform of α-enolase. This may represent a mechanism for negative feedback regulation of c-myc. It has been shown that Myc overexpression up-regulates liver carbohydrate metabolism 3–5-fold (36.Valera A. Pujol A. Gregori X. Rie E. Visa J. Bosch F. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1067-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37.Riu E. Bosch F. Valera A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2198-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Myc overexpression is thought to counteract diabetic hyperglycemia by inducing hepatic glucose uptake and utilization and therefore blocking gluconeogenesis. Although there is no direct evidence of the regulation of α-enolase promoter function by Myc, the plausibility of up-regulation of α-enolase by the overall carbohydrate hypermetabolic state cannot be ruled out. Up-regulated expression of glycolytic enzymes (pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase and glucokinase) as well as up-regulated glycolysis has been shown to occur as a consequence of Myc overexpression. This is thought to be due to the presence of two imperfect CACGTG motifs (5 out of 6 bases match) in the carbohydrate response element of the pyruvate kinase gene (38.Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23235-23238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Two perfect Myc-Max binding motifs (CACGTG) are also present in the promoter of the α-enolase gene (39.Giallongo A. Oliva D. Cali L. Barba G. Barbieri G. Feo S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These findings along with our observation of the bifunctional role of α-enolase as a glycolytic enzyme and regulator of c-myc expression present a model that places c-myc and α-enolase at the intersection of energy metabolism and growth control. We have used deletion mutants of α-enolase to characterize its functional domains. The finding that MBP-1 (EnoΔ1–96) binds to the c-myc P2 promoter, but EnoΔ1–236 does not, indicates that the amino acids between 96 and 236 of α-enolase are essential for DNA interaction. Among the α-enolase deletion mutants, MBP-1 was the most efficient down-regulator of c-myc promoter activity. Our results from the transient transfection assays corroborate those from the DNA binding studies, since EnoΔ1–236 was unable to down-regulate c-myc promoter activity. Both the C-terminal deletions of α-enolase (EnoΔ242–434 and EnoΔ373–434) contained amino acids 96–236 and were able to down-regulate expression of the c-myc promoter by at least 40% of its activity. The region between amino acids 96 and 236 is present in the MBP-1 isoform of α-enolase, which has been shown to down-regulate c-mycexpression by 65%. This result is consistent with the previously published work of Ghoshet al. (40.Ghosh A.K. Steele R. Ray R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2880-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which demonstrated transcriptional repression activity in the N-terminal portion of MBP-1. Our data show, however, that DNA binding activity correlates nicely with ability to inhibit transcription of c-myc. As seen by mutating methionine 94 and 97, the c-myc down-regulating activity of α-enolase is lost, by abolishing translation of the MBP-1 isoform. Thus, it is possible that the bifunctional role of α-enolase could be modulated by the varying ratio of the two isoforms. The existence of two α-enolase isoforms with distinct functions presents a unique example of a gene encoding proteins with roles in metabolism and cell proliferation. Our data suggest that, while the α-enolase isoform functions as the glycolytic enzyme, the N-terminal region of the MBP-1 isoform is important in binding to and down-regulating expression of the c-myc gene. The MBP-1 isoform has been shown to inhibit anchorage-independent cell growth and tumor growth in nude mice (13.Ray R.B. Steele R. Seftor E. Hendrix M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3747-3751PubMed Google Scholar). The manner in which the coding capacity of the α-enolase mRNA for the two protein isoforms is regulated has not been ascertained. Internal ribosome entry constitutes a novel mechanism of gene expression regulation. This has been shown in the case of FGF-2, whose CUG-initiated isoforms are translationally activated in response to stress (41.Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Whether this kind of initiation from the presence of an internal ribosome entry site occurs in the case of MBP-1 remains to be determined."

In addition to two yeast TPx isoforms (TSA I and TSA II/AHPC1) previously described, three additional TPx homologues were identified by analysis of the open reading frame data base for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Three novel isoforms showed a distinct thiol peroxidase activity supported by thioredoxin, and appeared to be distinctively localized in cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleus. Each isoform was named after its subcellular localization such as cytoplasmic TPx I (cTPx I or TSA I), cTPx II, cTPx III (TSA II/AHPC1), mitochondrial TPx (mTPx), and nuclear TPx (nTPx). Their transcriptional activities suggest that cTPx I and cTPx III are the most predominant isoforms among the five type isoforms. Transcriptional activities of TPx isoenzymes during yeast life span were quite different from each other. Unlike other TPx null mutants, cTPx I null mutant was hypersensitive to various oxidants except for 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide. The null mutant was more resistant toward 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide and acidic culture than its wild type. The severe growth retardation of cTPx II mutant resulted in accumulation of G1-phased cells.

Instead of active site of selenocysteine within glutathione peroxidase, they have one conserved cysteine within TPx as a primary site of catalysis.

However, based on cellular compartmentalization and tissue distribution, their cellular functions remain still debatable. Recently, two types of TPx isoenzymes were reported to exist inSaccharomyces cerevisiae referred as TSA I (4.Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

To gain insight into the physiological role of each TPx isoenzyme, we explored the function of the five isoforms in S. cerevisiaeas a model organism for eukaryotes. In this paper, in addition to TSA I and TSA II/AHP1, we reported for the first time the distinct subcellular localization and physiological function of three new types of TPx isoenzymes in yeast cells. Based on the different subcellular localization of TPx isoenzymes, their characteristic kinetic properties, and the physiology of mutants lacking each TPx isoenzyme, we suggest a distinct physiological role of each TPx isoenzyme in maintaining aerobic life of yeast. Standard methods were used for growth, transformation, and genetic manipulation of S. cerevisiae (14.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae strain JD7–7C (Matα, ura3-52, leu2, trpA, K + ) was the recipient in the TPx gene disruption and GFP expression experiment. Standard protocols were used for all recombinant DNA techniques. Northern blot analysis was performed as described (15.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from log-phase cells by using a hot phenol extraction method (16.Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 25: 3091-3092Crossref Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Total RNA (25 μg) was fractionated in a 1% denaturing agarose gel, blotted, and probed with PCR-amplified labeled ORF by using standard method (15.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For substitution of functional cysteine residue of TPx, PCR-based strategy was employed to introduce nucleotide substitution at the defined location (17.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Peese L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 15: 51-59Crossref Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). For replacement of putative functional cysteine of TPx with serine, respective cysteine codon (TGT for cTPx II and nTPx, TGC for mTPx) was changed to AGT or AGC (serine). Patch assays were done as described below. Aliquots (10 μl) containing approximately 103 or the indicated cell number of an overnight culture were spotted on YPD plates containing oxidants at the indicated concentration. Plates were monitored after 2–5 days of incubation at 30 °C. β-Galactosidase assay was performed as described (18.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Five yeast TPx genes were amplified from yeast genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with two pairs of primers covering whole coding sequence. Forward primer has an NdeI site and reverse primer has a BamHI site for cloning. The following primers were used for the PCR of TPx genes and enzyme sites are underlined: cTPx I (5′-CGATCCATATGGTCGCTCAAGTTCAAAAG (forward) and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTATTTGTTGGCAGCTTCGA (reverse)),cTPx II (5′-CGATCCATATGGTAGCAGAAGTTCAAAAA (forward) and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTAATTATTGGCATTTTTGAAATAC (reverse)), cTPx III (5′-CGATCCATATGTCTGACTTAGTTAACAAGAA (forward) and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTACAAATGAGCCAAGACACTTT (reverse)),mTPx (5′-CGATCCATATGTTTAGTAGAATTTGTAGCGC (forward) and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTATTTCGACTTGGTGAATCT (reverse)), and nTPx (5′-CGATCCATATGGGTGAAGCACTACGTAG (forward) and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTATTCTTCTTTAAACTTTTCAGCG (reverse)). The resulting PCR products were cloned intoEscherichia coli expression vector pT7-7. Transformed cells were cultured at 37 °C overnight in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and then transferred to fresh medium to the ratio of 1 to 200. When the optical density of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.4, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to final concentration of 0.5 mm. After induction for 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −70 °C until use. Frozen cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm EDTA and disrupted by sonication. The supernatants after centrifugation at 18,000 rpm using SS-34 rotor were loaded to Q-Sepharose column that had been previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 m over 200 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The fractions corresponding to the peak of TPx protein were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0). In the cases of cTPx II, mTPx, and nTPx, the flow-through fractions were pooled. After dialysis, samples were applied to CM-Sepharose column that had been previously equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0). The samples eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl were dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6) and stored at −70 °C. Standard protocols were used for immunoblot and two-dimensional electrophoresis. Antioxidant activity was determined by measuring the activity to protect the inactivation of E. coli glutamine synthetase (GS) by a thiol metal-catalyzed oxidation system (DTT/Fe3+/O2) (thiol MCO system) as described previously (4.Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 30-μl reaction mixture containing 100 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1.0 μg of GS, 3 μm FeCl3, various concentrations of TPx, and 10 mm DTT was incubated at 37 °C, and then 0.5 ml of γ-glutamyltransferase assay mixture was added. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the remaining activity of GS was determined by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm. Peroxidase reaction was performed in a 400-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 0.8 μm thioredoxin, 0.3 μm thioredoxin reductase, 0.26 mm NADPH, varying concentration of TPx, and 1 mm H2O2 or 1 mm t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) or 1 mm cumene hydroperoxide at room temperature. The peroxidase activity of TPx linked to NADPH oxidation was monitored as the decrease of A 340. For direct assay for peroxidase activity, the concentration of remaining H2O2was determined spectrophotometrically at 560 nm using ferrous ion oxidation using the xylenol orange 1 method (19.Wolff S.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 182-189Crossref Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). TPx was preincubated in the absence or presence of 5 mm DTT at 30 °C for 30 min, and then chemical modification was carried out in 100-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2.0 mg/ml TPx, and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide at 30 °C for 2 h as described previously (20.Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28635-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To remove un-reacted reagents, the reaction mixture was extensively dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at 4 °C. In order to construct GFP fusion vector, wild type GFP (gift from Dr. K. Song, Yonsei University, Korea) was amplified with primers (5′-CGCGGATCCATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTT, forward and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTTATTTGTATAGTTCATCCAT, reverse). The PCR product was digested with BamHI andHindIII and cloned into yeast expression vector YEGα-HIR525 (21.Choi E.S. Sohn J.H. Rhee S.K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1994; 42: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to produce pYGFP, which does not contain promoter sequence. For insertion of promoter at appropriate sites within pYGFP,Gal10 promoter sequence was amplified with respective primers having KpnI and BamHI site at each end and cloned into pYGFP to produce pYGFPC. And then, pYGFPC was fused C-terminal of TPx gene as follows. The PCR product corresponding to the entire open reading frame of mTPx ornTPx without the termination codon was digested withBamHI and cloned into the corresponding site in the yeast expression vector pYGFPC. Respective signal sequence-deletedTPx-GFP fusion for mTPx andnTPx were constructed with other forward primers (mTPx 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGCATGGACCCTTCCTAAGCA andnTPx 5′-CGCGGATCCATGACGGGTCCTAAACATAACGCT) and the corresponding reverse primers used previously. To make a GFP-TPx fusion (C-terminal of GFP fused to N-terminal of TPx), GFPwas amplified with the same forward primer for pYGFP construction and a reverse primer (5′-CCCAAGCTT AGATCTTTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGC) havingBglII site and HindIII site without stop codon. The BamHI- and HindIII-digested PCR products were cloned into pYGFPC. The resulting plasmid, pYGFPN, was digested withBglII and ligated with BamHI-digestedTPx PCR products. Putative promoter sequences (from the next nucleotide of the stop codon of previous gene to −1 of TPx ORF) of TPxwere identified by the analysis using the SGD program (Stanford University). The promoter sequences were amplified and digested withKpnI and BamHI. Enzyme-digested PCR products were cloned into pYGFP which resulted in TPx promoters fused with GFP. In order to make β-galactosidase-fused promoter sequences,lacZ gene was amplified with primers (5′-CGCGGATCCATGACCATGATTACGGATTCACT (forward) and 5′-GGTGAAGCTTATTATTATTTTTGACACCAGACC (reverse)) havingBamHI and HindIII sites at each end and cloned into YEGα-HIR525 digested with same enzymes to produce pYLac. The same PCR products of promoter sequences were cloned into pYLac, resulting in pYLac harboring each TPx promoter fused to the β-galactosidase gene. Null mutant of cTPx I was a laboratory stock used in previous work (11.Chae H.Z. Kim I.H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16815-16821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other TPxgenes were disrupted by short flanking homology method as follows. The 5′ and 3′ ends of four TPx genes were amplified with primers about 200 bases apart. Ura3 gene as marker was amplified from YEGα-HIR525 vector with primers (5′-ACAGGTTCAAATATACTATCTGTTT, forward and 5′-CATGCATTTACTTATAATACAGTTTT, reverse), and was used for the disruption of TPx gene by the insertion intoTPx gene. The first fusion PCR was performed by melting the 5′ end fragment of TPx gene amplified with forward primer (5′-ATGGTAGCAGAAGTTCAAAAACAA for cTPx II, 5′-ATGTCTGACTTAGTTAACAAGAAAT for cTPx III, 5′-AGTAGAATTTGTAGCGCTCAATTA for mTPx, and 5′-ATGGGTGAAGCACTACGTAGA for nTPx) and reverse primer (5′-Ura CF, GGTGGAGGCAAATAAAACTTGG for cTPx II, 5′-Ura CF, GTAACCTGGAATATGGCTGACA for cTPxIII, 5′-Ura CF, AGTAGTCGTAAAAATTGATTTTACC formTPx, and 5′-Ura CF, CTTAATCTCTATCCGCTAGGAT fornTPx) Additional bases complementary to theUra3 forward primer were represented as Ura CF. The PCR product was purified and the second fusion PCR was set up by melting the product of the first fusion PCR product and the 3′ end fragment of TPx gene amplified with forward primer (5′-Ura CR, TCATAATCGACCCGAAGGGAAT for cTPx II, 5′-Ura CR, AAGGACACCACACACATCAAGT for cTPx III, 5′-Ura CR, CGTCGGAAGAAACACTTCTGA for mTPx, and 5′-Ura CR, TGCCATATCATTTACTAAGCGAT for nTPx) and reverse primer (5′-TAATTATTGGCATTTTTGAAATACTC for cTPx II, 5′-CAAATGAGCCAAGACACTTTCG for cTPx III, 5′-TTATTTCGACTTGGTGAATCTTAAA for mTPx, and 5′-GCGACTTTTCAAATTTCTTCTTAC for nTPx). Additional bases complementary to the Ura3 reverse primer were represented asUra CR. The final PCR product was purified from low melting agarose and used directly for transformation. Uracil prototroph colonies were selected. In order to confirm the one-step displacement, PCR amplification and Southern blotting were done. To observe the GFP signal, induced cells were collected by centrifugation, and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 8.0). To minimize the drift of yeast over time, cells were suspended in a mixture of phosphate-buffered saline and 0.5% low-melt agarose. For the DNA staining experiment, cells were fixed with 4% p-formaldehyde for 3 h. After washing twice with 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), cells were treated with 1 mg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 3 h and stained with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide for 15 min. Mitochondria were stained with 100 nm rhodamine B hexyl ester in 10 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4), containing 5% glucose at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were observed by Carl Zeiss LSM 410 installed with a Ar laser at Korea Basic Science Institute. Scanning was performed by 488 nm laser (GFP) or 568 nm laser (propidium iodide and rhodamine B hexyl ester). Cells were fixed in 70% cold ethanol and stored overnight at 4 °C. Samples were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5). RNase A (10 mg/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C before addition of 2 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) followed by further incubation for 1 h at 55 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, propidium iodide (20 μg) was added and samples were incubated in the dark at 4 °C overnight. Flow cytometry analysis of at least 5000 cells was carried out for each sample in a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. In addition to TSA I and TSA II/AHPC1 previously described as yeast members of TSA/AhpC family (11.Chae H.Z. Kim I.H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

It was previously reported that the transcriptional level ofYDR453C was induced by skn7, Yap1, and H2O2 (22.Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). YBL064C was known to be hyperexpressed in high-density culture and upon diauxic shift (24.DeRisi J.L. Lyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 880-886Crossref Scopus (3707) Google Scholar), but its mRNA was not detected during growth on minimal media with glucose and ammonia (25.Scherens B. el Bakkoury M. Vierendeels F. Dubois E. Messenguy F. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1355-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). YIL010W/DOT5 was suggested to be involved in the derepression of telomeric silencing (26.Singer M.S. Kahana A. Wolf A.J. Meisinger L.L. Peterson S.E. Goggin C. Mahowald M. Gottschling D.E. Genetics. 1998; 150: 613-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its mRNA was 3.1-fold induced after exposure to the alkylating agent, methyl methanesufonate (27.Jelinsky S.Y. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1486-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). However, their biochemical and cellular functions as putative thiol peroxidase were not investigated. Fig.1 shows the primary structures of TPx homologous proteins. The amino acid sequence similarity among yeast TPx homologous proteins was 11.5%. The alignment of amino acid sequences showed one highly conserved cysteine within the TPx homologues, which suggested that three TSA homologues (i.e. YDR453C, YBL064C, and YIL010W) would be new members of TSA/AhpC family. The conserved cysteine within TSA I (YML028W) (i.e. Cys-48) and TSA II/AHP1 (YLR109W) (i.e. Cys-62) was previously reported to act as primary catalysis (11.Chae H.Z. Kim I.H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16815-16821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Jeong J.S. Kwon S.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Kim K.

To characterize three putativeTPx genes as thiol peroxidase, we cloned the genes and overexpressed the genes in E. coli. The proteins were homogeneously purified from the soluble fraction of the E. coli recombinants. The purities of proteins were confirmed on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2). The purified proteins were heated at 95 °C for 5 min in SDS sample buffer with DTT or without DTT, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The analysis of gene products on the SDS-PAGE gel indicated that except for YIL010W all proteins existed as homodimers in the absence of DTT, suggesting that the monomers were linked by disulfide bond. However, YIL010W was detected at the molecular size corresponding to the monomeric form regardless of the presence or absence of DTT. This result suggests that like a mammalian TSA/AhpC family, ORF6 (28.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), YIL010W exist as monomer upon oxidation.Figure 2SDS-PAGE analysis of purified TPx proteins.

Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) for prediction of putative targeting signal sequences reveals that a 29-kDa TPx, YBL064C, harbors a mitochondrial localization signal in its N-terminal region (2FSRICSAQLKRT13). YIL010W has a nuclear localization signal in its N-terminal region (35KKKIK39). YLR109W (i.e. TSA II/AHP1) (12.Jeong J.S. Kwon S.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Kim K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 13.Lee J. Spector D. Godon C. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4537-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) has a peroxisomal signal sequence in its C-terminal region (174AHL176). However, no targeting signal was identified in both YML028W (TSA I) and YDR453C. The positions of the putative signals for targeting were shown in Fig. 1. In order to evaluate the putative targeting signals, we expressed the GFP fusion proteins of the five types in S. cerevisiae. The cellular compartmentalization of each fusion protein was determined by confocal fluorescence microscopy of intact yeast cells. The control GFP was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm as previously reported (Fig.3 A) (30.Kain S.R. Adams M. Kondepudi A. Yang T.T. Ward W.W. Kitts P. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 650-655PubMed Google Scholar). Each C-terminal YBL064C and YIL010W were fused to the N-terminal of GFP, whereas N-terminal YML028W, YDR453C, and YLR109W were fused to the C-terminal of GFP. GFP-YML028W and GFP-YDR453C fusion proteins appeared to exist in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, B and C). As expected, YBL064C-GFP and YIL010W-GFP appeared to be localized in the mitochondria (Fig. 3 E) and the nucleus (Fig. 3 G), respectively. To confirm this subcellular localization, we deleted the respective signal sequence in each protein, and fused to GFP. The resulting YBL064C′-GFP and YIL010W′-GFP recombinant proteins were evenly distributed in the cytoplasmic space (Fig. 3, F andH). Fig. 4, A andB, shows the mitochondria and nucleus of yeast visualized by the organelle-specific fluorescent dyes. The exact overlapping between organelle-specific fluorescence and the corresponding GFP fusion protein fluorescence confirmed the mitochondrial and nuclear localization of YBL064C and YIL010W, respectively. However, in the case of GFP-YLR109W, the recombinant protein was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm despite of the presence of a putative peroxisomal signal sequence in its C-terminal region (174AHL176) (Fig. 3 D). The localization of YLR109W in cytoplasm was also investigated by direct immunoblot analysis of the organelle-free soluble and peroxisomal fractions, which was obtained from the yeast maximally grown in YPD medium. The immunoblot analysis exerted that the cytosol fraction after ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g possessed TSA II/AHP1 (YLR109W), whereas the precipitate containing peroxisome did not, suggesting its cytoplasmic localization. In contrast to our result, the possible peroxisomal localization of TSA II/AHP1 was previously suggested (13.Lee J. Spector D. Godon C. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4537-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).Figure 4Fluorescent localization of mTPx-GFP and nTPx-GFP to mitochondria and nucleus, respectively.

The cytosolic localization of TSA I was also previously described (11.Chae H.Z. Kim I.H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16815-16821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We carried out the enzymatic characterization of three novel TSA/AhpC proteins (cTPx II, mTPx, and nTPx). In the case of mTPx, the structural gene without DNA fragment encoding the signal sequences was expressed to obtain native proteins. A thiol-specific modification reagent, N-ethylmaleimide completely inactivated the antioxidant activities of the three novel proteins only in the presence of DTT, but did not without the preincubation of DTT (data not shown). This result suggests that three novel proteins may be thiol peroxidase. To investigate this possibility, we replaced each putative functional cysteine (Cys-48 for cTPx II, Cys-91 for mTPx, and Cys-107 for nTPx) with serine. All mutant proteins resulted in complete loss of antioxidant activity (data not shown). This result suggests that cTPx II (YDR453C), mTPx (YBL064C), and nTPx (YIL010W) are the novel members of AhpC/TSA family, and, at least, five types of TPx isoenzymes exist in S. cerevi"
https://openalex.org/W2022456133,"Aminopeptidase I (API) is delivered to the yeast vacuole by one of two alternative pathways, cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) or autophagy, depending on nutrient conditions. Genetic, morphological, and biochemical studies indicate that the two pathways share many of the same molecular components. The Cvt pathway functions during vegetative growth, while autophagy is induced during starvation. Both pathways involve the formation of cytosolic vesicles that fuse with the vacuole. In either case, the mechanism of vesicle formation is not known. Autophagic uptake displays a greater capacity for cytosolic protein sequestration. This suggests the involvement of an inducible protein(s) that allows the vesicle-forming machinery to adapt to the increased degradative needs of the cell. We have analyzed the biosynthesis of Aut7p, a protein required for both pathways. We find Aut7p expression is induced by nitrogen starvation. Aut7p is degraded by a process dependent on both proteinase A and Cvt/autophagy components. Protease accessibility assays demonstrate that Aut7p is located within vesicles in strains defective in vesicle delivery or breakdown. Finally, theaut7/cvt5 mutant accumulates precursor API at a stage prior to vesicle completion. These data suggest that Aut7p is induced during autophagy and delivered to the vacuole together with precursor API by Cvt/autophagic vesicles.

To fulfill this function, mechanisms must be adopted for specifically delivering both resident digestive enzymes and proteins destined for degradation to this organelle. The secretory pathway and endocytosis have long been considered to be the primary pathways for delivering resident hydrolases and their substrates to the vacuole, respectively (1.Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 230-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Riezman H. Munn A. Geli M.I. Hicke L. Experientia. 1996; 52: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have uncovered alternative vacuolar targeting pathways that appear morphologically analogous to the autophagic pathway employed by mammalian cells, suggesting that yeast also utilizes an autophagic delivery process (3.Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10807-10810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 4.Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In particular, double membrane vesicles, autophagosomes, form in the cytosol and sequester cytosolic proteins and organelles under conditions of nutrient starvation (5.Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These morphological observations in yeast have been confirmed by molecular genetic studies that have resulted in the isolation of two sets of mutants defective in autophagy, apg andaut (6.Thumm M. Egner R. Koch M. Schlumpberger M. Straub M. Veenhuis M. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 7.Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). These mutants have been found to overlap with a third set of mutants, cvt (8.Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), that were isolated based on defects in processing of the vacuolar hydrolase aminopeptidase I (API)1 (9.Harding T.M.

Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Unlike most resident hydrolases, API does not rely on the secretory pathway for vacuolar delivery. Instead, the precursor form of API (prAPI) is delivered to the vacuole directly from the cytosol via the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway (8.Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 11.Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The genetic overlap among theapg, aut, and cvt mutants suggests that the Cvt pathway and macroautophagy partially share the same machinery for vacuole protein delivery. Biochemical and morphological analyses indicated that the Cvt and autophagy pathways are mechanistically similar (5.Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). After synthesis in the cytosol, prAPI forms a higher order protein complex (the Cvt complex) that binds to a pelletable membrane fraction of unknown source (12.Kim J. Scott S.V. Oda M. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy studies revealed that membrane structures surround the Cvt complex to form a complete double membrane vesicle, the Cvt vesicle (150 nm in diameter) or autophagosome (300–900 nm in diameter; Ref. 13.Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), depending on the nutrient conditions. The double membrane vesicle then docks and fuses with the vacuole membrane, resulting in the release of a single membrane vesicle (the Cvt/autophagic body) into the vacuolar lumen. Subsequent breakdown of the Cvt/autophagic body and release of prAPI into the lumen for processing to its mature, active form mark the final stages of prAPI import. Despite the overlap between the two pathways, there are significant differences between autophagy and the Cvt pathway. The Cvt pathway is biosynthetic and constitutive and occurs under vegetative growth conditions. Thus far, prAPI represents the only known cargo protein of this pathway. In contrast, autophagy is induced under nutrient deprivation conditions and sequesters bulk cytoplasm, including organelles, for transport to the vacuole (10.Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Because prAPI is delivered to the vacuole under both conditions, it serves as a useful cargo marker for both pathways. It is not yet known how the conversion between these pathways is regulated. Analyses of the apg, aut, and cvtmutants have begun to reveal the roles of some of the protein components required for autophagic transport to the vacuole. For example, the Apg1 protein is a Ser/Thr kinase (14.Matsuura A. Tsukada M. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), although its target or site of action within the autophagic pathway has not been determined. The Apg5, -7, -10, -12, and -16 proteins function as part of a novel protein conjugation system (15.Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1367-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), although, once again, it is not known how these proteins participate in the dynamic membrane rearrangement that typifies autophagic sequestration. Further characterization of these Apg/Aut proteins will provide additional mechanistic details of this alternative protein sorting pathway to the vacuole. Recently, the AUT7 gene was isolated as a low copy suppressor of aut2 (20.Lang T. Schaeffeler E. Bernreuther D. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Based on the in vitro binding of Aut7p with tubulin, Lang et al. (20.Lang T. Schaeffeler E. Bernreuther D. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) suggested a model in which Aut7p functions as part of a protein complex that mediates the delivery of autophagic vesicles to the vacuole via the microtubule cytoskeleton. Complementation analysis also revealed that AUT7 is allelic to the CVT5/APG8 gene (10.Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In this study, we present a biochemical analysis of Aut7p and provide an alternative model for Aut7p function by demonstrating that Aut7p is involved in the completion of transport vesicles of the Cvt and autophagy pathways. Unlike all other Apg and Cvt proteins characterized thus far, Aut7p is the first component of these pathways that is induced by autophagy conditions. In addition, subcellular fractionation and protease sensitivity assays suggest that Aut7p is associated with the Cvt vesicle under vegetative conditions and with the autophagosome under starvation conditions.

Yeast cells were grown in synthetic minimal medium (SMD medium; 0.067% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, and auxotrophic amino acids and vitamins as needed). Synthetic minimal medium containing 2% glucose without ammonium sulfate or amino acids (SD(−N) medium) was used for nitrogen starvation experiments. For generating antiserum against Aut7p, a New Zealand White rabbit was injected with synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 1–20 and 33–48 of Aut7p conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Multiple Peptide Systems; San Diego, CA). The antiserum was prepared according to standard procedures (24.Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 61-99Google Scholar). Antisera against API and Vma4p were prepared as described previously (11.Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 25.Morano K.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2813-2824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antiserum against phosphoglycerate kinase was generously provided by Dr. Jeremy Thorner (26.Baum P. Thorner J. Honig L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4962-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All restriction enzymes and Vent DNA polymerase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Expre35S35S Protein Labeling Mix was from NEN Life Science Products. Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene fluoride) was from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Oxalyticase was from Enzogenetics (Corvallis, OR). YNB was from Difco. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). pCR-Blunt was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Protease inhibitors, proteinase K, and Pronase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other reagents were from Sigma. To clone the AUT7 gene, an 814-base pair fragment was amplified from chromosomal DNA by polymerase chain reaction. The 5′- and 3′-oligonucleotides incorporated anEcoRI and XhoI site, respectively (5′-CGTTTAAGTTAGAGTCATGGAATTCTAACTGTCTCCACCG-3′, 5′-CCATAACGTGCTCACATTTGTCTCGAGATACTGGTGAAATCTTGGCTCC-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was ligated into the vector pCR-Blunt, and an EcoRI/XhoI fragment was then cloned into the plasmid pRS426 to generate pAUT7(426). TheEcoRI/XhoI fragment from pAUT7(426) was cloned into pRS416 to construct plasmid pAUT7(416). The plasmids pAUT7(416) and pAUT7(426) complemented the prAPI accumulation defect of thecvt5 mutant. For evaluating steady-state Aut7p protein levels, cells were grown in SMD to A 600= 1 and transferred to SD(−N) medium. Aliquots were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice at indicated time points. After acetone washing twice, cells were lysed with glass beads in Tricine electrophoresis sample buffer (27.Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). 1.0 A 600cell equivalent of SEY6210 and 0.5 A 600 cell equivalent of TVY1 samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Resolution of Aut7p by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using a Tris-Tricine electrophoresis buffer system (27.Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar); all other proteins were subjected to standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis methods as described previously (18.Kim J. Dalton V.M. Eggerton K.P. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1337-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To examine Aut7p stability in different genetic backgrounds, cells were grown to A 600 = 1 and transferred to SD(−N) medium for 1 h. Cells were then collected and resuspended in fresh SD(−N) medium containing 11 μCi of 35S Express label/A 600 at a cell density of 50 A 600/ml. After a 20-min radioactive labeling reaction, the cells were chased in SD(−N) medium containing excess nonradioactive methionine and cysteine. Samples were removed at the indicated times and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Crude extracts were prepared by glass bead lysis and subjected to immunoprecipitation, as described previously (8.Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). To biochemically examine the subcellular distribution of Aut7p, cells were grown to A 600 = 1 in SMD medium. Strains examined under starvation conditions were then incubated in SD(−N) medium for 1 h prior to spheroplasting. Strains examined in vegetative growth conditions were spheroplasted directly after growth in SMD medium. The procedures for preparing spheroplasts were according to a recently modified protocol (18.Kim J. Dalton V.M. Eggerton K.P. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1337-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated in 0.1 mTris-SO4/20 mm dithiothreitol buffer at 30 °C for 20 min. Cells were then transferred to osmotically supportive spheroplasting medium (1 m sorbitol, 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8) containing 5 μg/A 600 of oxalyticase. Spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min and resuspended in PS200 lysis buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol) containing 5 mm MgCl2and a protease inhibitor mixture. After a preclearing spin at 500 × g for 5 min to remove unlysed spheroplasts, the total lysate (Fig. 1, T) was subjected to centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, resulting in soluble and pellet fractions (S13 and P13, respectively). The S13 fraction was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to generate high speed supernatant and pellet fractions (S100 and P100, respectively). To determine if the pelletable fraction of Aut7p was membrane-associated, spheroplasts were lysed in PS0 lysis buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, containing 5 mmMgCl2 and a protease inhibitor mixture). The P13 fraction was resuspended with PS0 lysis buffer alone or with PS0 lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, samples were separated into S13 and P13 fractions by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described previously (18.Kim J. Dalton V.M. Eggerton K.P. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1337-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Membrane flotation experiments were performed using a modification of a previously described protocol (28.Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1727-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, spheroplasts from cvt5 mutant cells were subjected to differential osmotic lysis by resuspension in PS200 buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2. The pellet fraction was collected after centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min. Ficoll flotation was performed as described previously (28.Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1727-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) except that the Ficoll solutions were made in PS200 containing 5 mmMgCl2. The pellet fraction from 18A 600 units of cells was resuspended in 100 μl of 15% Ficoll and overlaid with 1 ml of 13% Ficoll and 300 μl of 2% Ficoll. The resulting step gradient was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The float (Fig. 1, F) fraction was the top 500 μl, the nonfloat (Fig. 1, NF) fraction was the remaining solution, and the pellet (Fig. 1, P) fraction was the gradient pellet. All three fractions were subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation and immunoblot with antiserum against API or Aut7p. Spheroplasts (20A 600 units/ml) were subjected to differential osmotic lysis in PS200 containing 5 mm MgCl2. After centrifugation at 5,000 or 13,000 × g for 5 min, the pellet (P5 or P13) fractions were treated with 50 μg/ml proteinase K (Fig. 1) or 150 μg/ml Pronase (Fig. 7) for 30 or 15 min on ice, respectively, in the presence or absence of 0.2% Triton X-100. Following protease treatment, samples were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and analyzed by immunoblot. Recently, Lang et al. (20.Lang T. Schaeffeler E. Bernreuther D. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) proposed that Aut7p functions as an adaptor protein linking autophagosomes to microtubules via Aut2p. According to this model, Aut7p would function in the movement of completed autophagosomes to the vacuole. The cvt5/aut7 mutant is defective in both autophagy and the Cvt pathway that localize the resident vacuolar hydrolase API (8.Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 9.Harding T.M. Hefner-Gravink A. Thumm M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 10.Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Hence, Aut7p would be predicted to play a similar role in both delivery processes. To determine the function of Aut7p in the Cvt pathway, we examined the state of prAPI in the cvt5/aut7mutant. cvt5 mutant cells were grown in SMD medium and converted to spheroplasts. Osmotic lysates were centrifuged at 5,000 × g, and the P5 fractions containing accumulated precursor API were treated with proteinase K in the absence or presence of detergent. Precursor API was found to be protease-sensitive in thecvt5 mutant, indicating that it was not enclosed within a vesicle (Fig. 1 A; Ref. 8.Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Theypt7Δ strain is defective in the fusion of completed Cvt vesicles with the vacuole (18.Kim J. Dalton V.M. Eggerton K.P. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1337-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In contrast to the result with thecvt5 mutant, prAPI was resistant to exogenous protease in the ypt7Δ strain (Fig. 1 A; Ref. 18.Kim J. Dalton V.M. Eggerton K.P. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1337-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The protease sensitivity of prAPI in the cvt5 strain indicated that Aut7p functions at a step prior to vesicle formation/completion in the Cvt and autophagy pathways. To further assess the step at which prAPI is blocked in the cvt5strain, membrane flotation analysis was performed. An osmotic cell lysate from the cvt5 strain was centrifuged to generate a pelletable fraction containing most of the prAPI as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This fraction was then resuspended in 100 μl of 15% Ficoll solution with or without Triton X-100 and overlaid with 1 ml and 300 μl of 13 and 2% Ficoll solutions, respectively. The resulting step gradient was spun at 13,000 ×g for 10 min. Because lipid components lower the membrane density, membranes and associated proteins float to the interface of the 2 and 13% Ficoll solutions (Fig. 1, F, float fraction). Soluble proteins remain in the lower portion of the gradient (NF, nonfloat fraction) and protein complexes sediment and form a pellet (P, pellet fraction). Precursor API is detected largely in the float fraction in the cvt5 mutant in the absence of detergent (Fig. 1 B). The location of prAPI in the float fraction is dependent on membrane, because the addition of detergent eliminates its presence in this fraction. Treatment with TX-100 caused all of the prAPI to localize to the pellet fraction, suggesting that prAPI exists as a large protein complex associated with membrane in the cvt5 strain. These experiments indicate that while prAPI import is blocked at a stage before the completion of vesicle formation, it nevertheless associates with a lipid or floatable membrane fraction in the cvt5/aut7 mutant. Our analyses of the state of prAPI in the cvt5/aut7 mutant argue against a role for Aut7p in the transport of completed vesicles to the vacuole. To gain further insight into the function of Aut7p, we decided to examine the biosynthesis of this protein. The AUT7 gene encodes a protein of 117 amino acids with no apparent signal sequence or transmembrane domains (20.Lang T. Schaeffeler E. Bernreuther D. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To examine Aut7p, antiserum was generated against two synthetic peptides. Crude lysates prepared from wild type and cvt5 cells harboring either the centromeric or multicopy versions of AUT7 plasmids were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the anti-Aut7p antiserum (Fig.2). The anti-Aut7p antiserum detected a protein with a molecular mass of ∼14 kDa, in agreement with the predicted size based on the AUT7 sequence. The antiserum detected a weak signal in wild type cells only after prolonged exposure of the immunoblot. This 14-kDa band was absent in cvt5 cells but could be detected in a dose-dependent manner incvt5 cells transformed with the centromeric or multicopyAUT7 plasmids, suggesting that the antiserum is specific for Aut7p (Fig. 2). While the autophagy pathway is induced under nutrient limiting conditions, none of the autophagic components examined so far appear to be expressed at a significantly elevated level when subjected to nitrogen starvation. To determine if Aut7p levels were dependent on growth conditions, Aut7p expression was examined in both vegetative and starvation media. Cells were grown to mid-log phase (1A 600/ml) in SMD medium and shifted to SD(−N) medium for the indicated times. Crude lysates were prepared and examined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3). In wild type cells, the increase in the level of Aut7p corresponds to the amount of time incubated in nitrogen starvation medium. Therefore, unlike other proteins required for autophagy, the expression of Aut7p is induced under starvation conditions. Interestingly, in a strain lacking vacuolar proteinase A,pep4Δ, Aut7p accumulated at a much higher level than in wild type cells (Fig. 3). Even prior to the shift from vegetative to starvation conditions, pep4Δ cells had already accumulated a significant amount of Aut7p. Because proteinase A is required for proteolytic activation of many vacuolar enzymes, this result suggests that Aut7p levels are modulated in a manner that is dependent on the degradative activity of vacuolar hydrolases. As a control for the induction experiment, the expression level of Vma4p, a peripheral subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), was also examined by immunoblot analysis. V-ATPase function has been demonstrated to be required for efficient delivery of vacuolar hydrolases (10.Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Therefore, Vma4p is postulated to be maintained at a stable level in starvation medium for supporting the hydrolytic capacity of vacuoles. Indeed, Vma4p levels do not change in starvation conditions within the period examined (Fig. 3). Finally, to verify that the observed induction is not a general property of Apg/Cvt proteins, we examined the level of Apg7p. The Apg7 protein is involved in a novel conjugation reaction that is required for both autophagy and the Cvt pathway (15.Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 18.Kim J. Dalton V.M. Eggerton K.P. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1367-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Apg7p levels remained constant throughout the induction period, indicating that the increase in protein level is specific to Aut7p. The increased accumulation of Aut7p in the pep4Δ strain under steady-state conditions suggested that its stability was dependent on vacuolar proteases. To examine the kinetics of Aut7p degradation, radioactive pulse/chase experiments were performed in wild type andpep4Δ strains. In order to increase the detection of the Aut7p signal, cells were shifted to SD(−N) medium for 1 h to induce Aut7p expression prior to the radioactive labeling reaction. After 20 min of labeling in SD(−N) medium, cells were chased in fresh SD(−N) medium. Samples were removed at the indicated times and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis. In wild type cells, approximately 80% of the Aut7p signal disappears over the course of the 6-h chase reaction (Fig.4). Quantification revealed an Aut7p degradation half-time of ∼2.5 h (Fig. 4 B). Autophagy shows an initial lag and then reaches maximal uptake at approximately 3 h following a shift to SD(−N) medium, based on maturation of the autophagic marke"

Erk-1/2 activities, downstream of protein kinase C, decreased as chondrogenesis proceeded, whereas p38 activities, independent of protein kinase C, continuously increased during chondrogenesis. Inhibition of Erk-1/2 with PD98059 enhanced chondrogenesis up to 1.7-fold, whereas inhibition of p38 with SB203580 reduced it to about 30% of the control level. Inhibition of Erk-1/2 or p38 did not affect precartilage condensation. However, cartilage nodule formation was significantly blocked by the inhibition of p38, whereas Erk-1/2 inhibition did not affect it. Modulation of chondrogenesis by the inhibition of Erk-1/2 and p38 was accompanied by altered expression of adhesion molecules in an opposite way. Expression ofN-cadherin was reduced as chondrogenesis proceeded. Inhibition of p38 caused sustained expression ofN-cadherin, whereas Erk-1/2 inhibition accelerated the reduction of N-cadherin expression. Expression of integrin α5β1 and fibronectin were found to transiently increase during chondrogenesis. Inhibition of p38 caused continuous increase of expression of these molecules, whereas Erk-1/2 inhibition accelerated the decrease of expression of these molecules at a later period of chondrogenesis. Because temporal expression of these adhesion molecules regulates chondrogenesis, the above results indicate that Erk-1/2 and p38 conversely regulate chondrogenesis at post-precartilage condensation stages by modulating expression of adhesion molecules.

It becomes evident that several adhesion molecules including cadherins (4.Tavella S. Raffo P. Tacchetti C. Cancedda C. Castagnola P. Exp.

Limb mesenchymes undergo spontaneous differentiation to chondrocytes in vitro when cultured at a high seeding density such as micromass culture in the presence of serum. Precartilage condensation similar to that formedin vivo during chondrogenesis occurs in micromass cultures of limb mesenchymes (13.Aulthouse A.L. Solursh M. Dev. Biol. 1987; 120: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The cellular aggregates that form in early micromass cultures subsequently differentiate into cartilage nodules, which express cartilage-specific molecules such as type II collagen (6.Oberlender S.O.

However, the signal transduction pathways involved in precartilage condensation and initiated by condensation are not well characterized. We have previously shown that protein kinase C (PKC) positively regulates chondrogenesis of mesenchymes (17.Choi B. Chun J.-S. Lee Y.-S. Sonn J.-K. Kang S.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18.Chang S.-H. Oh C.-D. Yang M.-S. Kang S.-S. Lee Y.-S. Sonn J.-K. Chun J.-S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 20.Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Multiple PKC isoforms such as α, ε, ζ, and λ/ι were expressed in chick limb mesenchymes. Among these, an increase in expression level and translocation from cytosol to the particulate membrane fractions was most evident in PKC α, suggesting an important role for PKC α in the regulation of chondrogenesis. PKC regulated both proliferation of chondrogenic competent cells and expression of cell adhesion molecules involved in precartilage condensation. PKC-induced regulation of expressions of cell adhesion molecules such as N-cadherin, fibronectin, and its receptor α5β1 integrin appeared to be exerted via signaling through the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase subtype, Erk-1/2 (18.Chang S.-H.

MAP kinases play a key role in a variety of cellular responses including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of cells. Several parallel MAP kinase signaling pathways have been defined in mammalian cells (21.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar, 22.Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 23.Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The major MAP kinase subtypes include Erk-1 and -2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase, and p38 MAP kinase. Individual MAP kinase subtypes appear to have equivalent but distinct upstream kinases that are activated by a wide variety of extracellular stimuli. Some extracellular stimuli appear to activate multiple MAP kinase pathways, whereas other signals activate single MAP kinase pathway (21.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar, 22.Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 23.Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Our previous study indicated that Erks-1/2 are key signaling molecules in PKC regulation of micromass culture-induced chondrogenesis (18.Chang S.-H. Oh C.-D. Yang M.-S. Kang S.-S. Lee Y.-S.

Because MAP kinase subtypes regulate cellular functions either cooperatively or antagonistically in many cases (24.Kumar A. Middleton A. Chambers T.C. Mehata K.D. J. Biol.

Here, we report that p38 and Erk-1/2 act as positive and negative regulators of chondrogenesis, respectively, by conversely regulating expression of cell adhesion molecules including N-cadherin, fibronectin, and its receptor α5β1 integrin at post-precartilage condensation stage. Mesenchymes were derived from the distal tips of Hamburger-Hamilton stage 23/24 embryo limb buds (27.Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (9973) Google Scholar) of fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs as described previously (18.Chang S.-H. Oh C.-D. Yang M.-S. Kang S.-S. Lee Y.-S.

The cells were suspended at a density of 2.0 × 107 cells/ml in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and chondrogenesis was induced by adding the cells in 15-μl drops to culture dishes. The cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C to allow attachment and maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin either in the absence or presence of various reagents as described in each experiment. Chondrogenesis was determined by examining the expression of type II collagen as described below and quantitated by staining sulfated cartilage matrix with Alcian blue. Briefly, micromass-cultured cells were stained with Alcian blue; Alcian blue bound to sulfated glycosaminoglycans was extracted with 4m guanidine-HCl and quantitated by measuring absorbance at 600 nm. Differentiating mesenchymes were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed and incubated for 1 h with anti-collagen type II monoclonal antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) or 100 mg/ml of biotinylated PNA (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Type II collagen and PNA binding were visualized by developing with VECTASTAIN ABC and DAB substrate solution kits (Vector Laboratories Inc.) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer (18.Chang S.-H.

Proliferation of mesenchymes during micromass culture was determined by direct counting of viable cells as described previously (18.Chang S.-H. Oh C.-D. Yang M.-S. Kang S.-S. Lee Y.-S. Sonn J.-K. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19213-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, mesenchymes were micromass-cultured (3 spots/35-mm dish) in the absence or presence of various reagents for the indicated time periods. Individual cells were suspended with 0.1% of trypsin and collagenase, and the number of viable cells was counted in triplicate using a hemocytometer. Cytosolic and particulate membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (18.Chang S.-H. Oh C.-D. Yang M.-S. Kang S.-S. Lee Y.-S. Sonn J.-K. Chun J.-S. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells micromass-cultured for indicated periods were scraped in buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 msucrose, 2 mm EGTA, and 2 mm EDTA supplemented with inhibitors of protease and phosphatase (18.Chang S.-H.

The supernatant was designated as cytosolic fraction. The pellet was extracted with buffer B containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Following centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 15 min, the supernatant was saved as the particulate membrane fraction. Total cell lysate was prepared from cells micromass-cultured for various periods by extracting proteins with a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS supplemented with protease inhibitors. Proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose sheet was blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline. PKC isoforms were detected with isoform-specific anti-PKC monoclonal antibodies for ε and λ/ι (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) or with polyclonal antibodies for α and ζ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Expression of adhesion molecules was determined by using antibodies purchased from the following sources: rabbit anti-chick N-cadherin polyclonal antibody from Sigma, rabbit anti-human fibronectin polyclonal antibody from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), mouse anti-chick integrin α5 monoclonal antibody from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA), and rabbit anti-human integrin β1 polyclonal antibody from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The blots were developed using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and proteins were visualized by the ECL system. Mesenchymes were micromass-cultured in the absence or presence of various reagents for the indicated time periods. Proteins were extracted with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and inhibitors of proteases and phosphatases. Expression of Erk-1/2 was determined by Western blotting using antibodies obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., and its activation was examined by Western blotting using antibody specific to activated Erk-1/2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as described previously (18.Chang S.-H. Oh C.-D. Yang M.-S. Kang S.-S. Lee Y.-S. Sonn J.-K. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19213-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 29.Kim J.-Y. Yang M.-S. Oh C.-D. Kim K.-T. Ha M.-J. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 275-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activity of p38 was determined by immunocomplex kinase assay. Briefly, cell lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, and inhibitors of proteases and phosphatases. The samples were precipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-p38 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Immunocomplexes were collected by binding to protein A-agarose beads (Pierce). After washing with lysis buffer, the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmMgCl2, [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein as a substrate for p38 (New England Biolabs). Following incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 4× Laemmli's sample buffer followed by boiling. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis, and then phosphorylation of ATF-2 was determined by autoradiography. To determine subtype-specific functions of MAP kinases, we first examined their activities and changes during spontaneous chondrogenesis of mesenchymes initiated by micromass culture. Activation of Erk-1 and -2 was determined by Western blotting with antibody that recognized activated Erk-1/2. Because Erk-1 is a major Erk isoform and the phosphorylation pattern of Erk-2 is very similar to that of Erk-1 in chick mesenchymes (18.Chang S.-H. Oh C.-D. Yang M.-S. Kang S.-S. Lee Y.-S. Sonn J.-K. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19213-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we showed results of only Erk-1 in this study. Phosphorylation levels of Erk-1 were high at 1-day-old culture and decreased as chondrogenesis proceeded (Fig.1 A, upper panel). The addition of 5 μm PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase (30.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar), to the culture significantly blocked Erk-1 activation. However, the addition of 10 μm SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase (31.Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Fee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar), to the culture did not affect the decrease in Erk-1/2 activities. SB203580 also did not affect PD98059-induced inhibition of Erk-1 phosphorylation. Expression levels of Erk-1 remained constant in cells treated with PD98059 and/or SB203580 at 3-day culture (Fig. 1 A, middle panel) or throughout the culture period (data not shown). Activity of p38 was very low at 1-day culture times; however, it dramatically increased as chondrogenesis proceeded (Fig. 1 B,upper panel). Treatment of cells with SB203580 significantly blocked p38 activity to about 10% of control level. Activity of p38 was not affected by inhibition of Erk-1/2 with PD98059. Also, the addition of PD98059 to the cells pretreated with SB203580 did not significantly affect SB203580-induced inhibition of p38 activity (Fig.1 B, upper panel). In contrast to the change in activities, expression of p38 did not change during chondrogenesis in cells treated with PD98059 and/or SB203580 (Fig. 1 B,middle panel). Thus, Erk-1/2 and p38 activities are oppositely regulated during chondrogenesis, and it is not likely that Erk-1/2 and p38 directly cross-talk to regulate each other's activities. To determine whether the conversely regulated activities of Erk-1/2 and p38 have differential roles in chondrogenesis, chondrogenic differentiation was confirmed in control culture by examining cartilage-specific type II collagen expression (Fig.2 A). When Erk-1/2 was inhibited by PD98059, expression of type II collagen was significantly enhanced, to the extent of covering a whole area of individual spots (Fig. 2 A). Alcian blue staining of sulfated proteoglycans revealed that chondrogenesis was enhanced up to 1.7-fold in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B andC). In contrast to the effects of Erk-1/2 inhibition, however, inhibition of p38 with SB203580 (10 μm) significantly blocked expression of type II collagen. Type II collagen expression was restricted to cartilage nodules whose numbers were significantly reduced compared with control culture (Fig.2 A). The degree of chondrogenesis in SB203580-treated cells was about 30% of the control, and the effect of SB203580 was dose-dependent as quantitated by Alcian blue staining (Fig.2, B and C). The functional role of p38 in chondrogenesis was further supported by the observation that PD169316, another potent inhibitor of this kinase (32.Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-24904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), inhibited chondrogenesis in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). Taken together, the above results indicated that Erk-1/2 and p38 acted as negative and positive regulators of chondrogenesis, respectively, during in vitro micromass culture. The inhibitory effect of SB203580 on chondrogenesis was abolished by the inhibition of Erk-1/2 with PD98059 at low concentrations of SB203580 (i.e. 2.5 and 5 μm). However, at high concentrations of SB203580 (i.e. 10 and 20 μm), Erk-1/2 inhibition did not completely promote recovery of chondrogenesis that was blocked by p38 inhibition (Fig.3). The degree of chondrogenesis was 41 ± 4 and 29 ± 4% at 10 and 20 μm of SB203580, and inhibition of Erk-1/2 induced differentiation by 51 ± 4 and 35 ± 3%, respectively. Therefore, although inhibition of Erk-1/2 enhanced chondrogenic differentiation in the presence of p38 activity, Erk-1/2 inhibition appeared to be insufficient to induce chondrogenesis in the absence of p38 activity. Because many extracellular molecules known to regulate chondrogenesis exert their effects at the stages of cell proliferation and/or precartilage condensation (5.Tsonis P.A. Rio-Tsonis K.D.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4966-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we first examined whether the opposing roles of p38 and Erk-1/2 in the regulation of chondrogenesis were due to converse regulation of cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 4, although chondrogenesis was significantly enhanced (Fig. 2), inhibition of Erk-1/2 did not affect proliferation of chondrogenic competent cells as determined by direct cell counting. Similarly, inhibition of p38 with SB203580 to block chondrogenesis up to about 30% of the control level (Fig. 2), also did not affect proliferation of the cells (Fig.4). This indicated that negative and positive effects on chondrogenesis by the inhibition of p38 and Erk-1/2, respectively, were not brought about by modulating proliferation of chondrogenic competent cells. We next examined the question of whether Erk-1/2 and p38 regulated chondrogenesis by modulating precartilage condensation or by affecting cellular events initiated by precartilage condensation. Precartilage condensation was verified by staining cells with PNA, a specific marker of precartilage condensation. PNA bound cell aggregates or precartilage condensation before the deposition of cartilage-specific ECM components, making it possible to distinguish between precartilage condensation and differentiated cartilage nodules (11.Maleski M.P. Knudson C.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13.Aulthouse A.L. Solursh M. Dev. Biol. 1987; 120: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). On day 2 culture, numerous precartilage condensations or aggregates were present (Fig.5), which were not differentiated to cartilage nodules as seen by the absence of Alcian blue staining (Fig.5). The cell aggregates became large (Fig. 5) and differentiated to cartilage nodules on day 4 culture that were stained by Alcian blue (Fig. 5). Inhibition of Erk-1/2 with PD98059 did not significantly affect precartilage condensation on 2-day-old culture. The size and number of cartilage nodules on 4-day-old culture were also not affected by the inhibition of Erk-1/2 (Fig. 5). However, Alcian blue staining was significantly enhanced when Erk-1/2 was inhibited with PD98059 (Fig.5), suggesting that inhibition of Erk-1/2 enhanced expression of cartilage-specific molecules including type II collagen and sulfated glycosaminoglycans, but not by direct modulation of morphological changes such as precartilage cartilage condensation and cartilage nodule formation. Similar to the effects of Erk-1/2 inhibition, inhibition of p38 with SB203580 did not affect precartilage condensation on day 2 culture (Fig. 5). However, coalescence of cellular aggregates and differentiation to cartilage nodules on day 4 culture were significantly blocked in cells treated with SB203580 (Fig.5). Therefore, p38 activity appeared to be required for the cellular events involved in progression of precartilage condensation to the cartilage nodule. Precartilage condensation as well as its progression to cartilage nodules requires a regulated expression of cell adhesion molecules and ECM components (4.Tavella S. Raffo P. Tacchetti C. Cancedda C. Castagnola P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 8.Shakibaei M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9.Tavella S.

Physiol. 1993; 156: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, the roles of the MAP kinase subtypes in the expression of cell adhesion molecules and ECM components were examined. Expression ofN-cadherin was high in 1-day-old culture and was reduced as chondrogenesis proceeded (Fig. 6). However, the inhibition of p38 with SB203580 induced sustained expression of N-cadherin throughout the culture period, whereas the inhibition of Erk-1/2 accelerated the decrease ofN-cadherin expression at the later periods of micromass culture (Fig. 6). This indicated that p38 and Erk-1/2 activities had opposing effects on N-cadherin expression during chondrogenesis. Similar to converse regulation of N-cadherin expression, the expressions of fibronectin and its receptor integrin α5β1 were also conversely regulated by p38 and Erk-1/2. The expression of integrins α5 and β1 and fibronectin was increased transiently during chondrogenesis; their expression was detected in cells cultured for 1 day, increased as chondrogenesis proceeded, and decreased thereafter at the later stages of chondrogenic differentiation, i.e. the fifth day of culture (Fig. 6). Inhibition of Erk-1/2 or p38 did not significantly change expression patterns of these molecules at early periods of micromass culture, i.e. from 1 to 3-day-old cultures. However, the inhibition of Erk-1/2 accelerated the decrease of integrin α5 and β1 and fibronectin expression in the fourth and fifth day cultures, whereas the inhibition of p38 caused continuous increase of expression of integrins α5 and β1 throughout the culture period (Fig. 6). Because a reduction of N-cadherin, integrin α5β1, and fibronectin expression is necessary for chondrogenesis to progress after cell condensation (4.Tavella S. Raffo P. Tacchetti C. Cancedda C.

The method was applied for the isolation of activators of Trichoderma reesei(Hypocrea jecorina) cellulase genes. Activator genes were isolated from a T. reesei expression cDNA library on the basis of the ability of their translation products to activate transcription from the full-length T. reesei cbh1 promoter coupled to the S. cerevisiae HIS3 gene and to support the growth of the yeast colonies in the absence of histidine. Among the clones obtained was the ace1 gene encoding a novel polypeptide, ACEI, that contains three zinc finger motifs of Cys2-His2 type. Possible ACEI homologues were found among expressed sequence tags of Aspergillus andNeurospora. The ability of ACEI to bind to thecbh1 promoter was further confirmed in the yeast one-hybrid system. In vitro binding and gel mobility shift assays revealed several binding sites for the ACEI protein in thecbh1 promoter.

Penttilä M.E. Harman G.E. Kubicek C.P. Trichoderma & Gliocladium. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1998: 49-72Google Scholar), have been studied in detail by several groups. The activity of cellulase genes is controlled at the level of transcription: the genes are repressed in the presence of glucose and highly induced when cellulose, its derivatives, or certain oligosaccharides, such as sophorose, are present. Glucose repression is mediated by the CREI protein (6.Strauss J. Mach R.L. Zeilinger S. Hartler G. Stöffler G. Wolschek M. Kubicek C.P.

Onnela M.-L. Klemsdal S. Keränen S. Penttilä M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 303-314PubMed Google Scholar). CREI also mediates repression of a number of other genes coding for enzymes involved in degradation of hemicellulose and cellulose (10.Margolles-Clark E. Ilmén M. Penttilä M. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 57: 167-179Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition to cre1, no other genes for transcription factors have been described in T. reesei. Based on the gene expression data, it can be concluded that a distinct induction pathway for cellulases must exist in T. reesei that is needed for high level transcription (11.Henrique-Silva F.

Onnela M.-L. Penttilä M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the genes responsible for transcription activation are completely unknown. Furthermore, there is lack of knowledge about possible target sequences for cellulase-specific transcription activators from any filamentous fungi. The aim of this study was to identify genes encoding transcription activators involved in regulation of the activity of cellulase genes. For this purpose, we developed a genetic selection system that allowed us to isolate novel transcription activators from T. reeseicDNA expression library based on their ability to bind and activate transcription from the T. reesei cbh1 promoter inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Escherichia coli strains JS4 and DH5α were used for library and plasmid constructions, respectively. Strain TOP10F′ was used as a host for the pZErO-1 based vectors and strain BL21(DE3)LysS was used as a host for production of glutathione S-transferase (GST)1 fusion proteins. S. cerevisiae strain DBY746 (ATCC 44773, α, his3-1, leu2-3, leu2-112, ura3-52, trp1-289, cyhr, cir+) (D. Bothstein, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA) was used as a host for propagation of the reporter plasmids and the expression library. S. cerevisiaestrain YM4271 (MATa, ura3–52, his3-200, ade2-101, lys2-801, leu2-3, 112, trp1-903, tyr1-501, gal4-Δ512, gal80-Δ538, ade5::hisG) (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) was the host in the one-hybrid experiment. S. cerevisiae H190 (SUC2, ade2-1, can1-100, his3-11, his3-15, leu2-3, leu2-112, trp1-1, ura3-1, mig1-δ2::LEU2) was obtained from H. Ronne (Uppsala, Sweden). T. reesei strain Rut-C30 (ATCC 56765; Ref. 13.Montenecourt B.S. Eveleigh D.E. Adv. Chem. Ser. 1979; 181: 289-301Crossref Google Scholar) was used in the preparation of the cDNA library. The genomic cosmid library was from the strain VTT-D-80133 (14.Bailey M.J. Nevalainen K., M., H. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1981; 3: 153-157Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar).

Technol. 1981; 3: 153-157Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and the strain QM9414 (ATCC 26921; Ref. 16.Mandels M. Weber J. Parizek R. Appl.

Mäntylä, unpublished data. originating from VTT-D-79125. Host yeast strains were grown in yeast/peptone dextrose medium. Synthetic selection media (SC) lacking the appropriate nutrients were used for the plasmid-carrying strains (18.Sherman F. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, London1991: 3-21Google Scholar). SC-Leu-His plates supplemented with 45 mm3-aminotriazole were used in the one-hybrid activation test. Plates used in yeast electroporation contained 1 m sorbitol. The culture conditions used for T. reesei Rut-C30 to induce the production of hydrolytic enzymes and the preparation of the cDNA library have been described (19.Saloheimo A. Henrissat B. Hoffrén A.-M. Teleman O. Penttilä M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Media used inTrichoderma transformation have been published (20.Penttilä M. Nevalainen H. Rättö M. Salminen E. Knowles J.K.C. Gene. 1987; 61: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Media used to study growth contained Trichoderma minimal medium (12.Ilmén M. Saloheimo A. Onnela M.-L. Penttilä M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% peptone and either 2% glucose or 1% Solka floc cellulose or Avicel cellulose. 0.1% Triton X-100 was added to restrict the radial growth of the colonies. The reporter plasmid pAS3 was constructed as follows. pRS315 (21.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the yeast single-copy vector containing the LEU2 marker, was digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and SalI. TheHIS3 reporter gene of S. cerevisiae was cloned by PCR using the cosmid p3030 (22.Penttilä M.E. Nevalainen K.M.H. Raynal A. Knowles J.K.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 194: 494-499Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar) 3Hohn and Hinnen, unpublished data. as a template and sequence-specific primers complementary with the HIS3promoter sequences starting from 78 bp upstream of the initiator ATG (AAAGGATCCTTATACATTATATAAAGTAATG; BamHI underlined) and the HIS3 terminator sequences (ATATAGTCGACCTCGGGGACACCAAATATGG; SalI underlined), creating terminal BamHI and SalI sites to facilitate cloning of the fragment into pRS315. TheHIS3 gene of the resulting pAS1 plasmid begins 78 bp upstream from the initiator ATG and contains a minimal promoter including the TATA box, and it should not support growth in the absence of histidine. The resulting plasmid pAS1 was digested withSacI and XbaI, located immediately upstream of the HIS3 gene, and a PCR product containing the 1.15-kbcbh1 promoter fragment upstream from and excluding thecbh1 TATA box (from −1281 to −133 upstream of ATG) was ligated in front of the HIS3 gene producing pAS3. The primers used for cbh1 promoter amplification were (−1281) (ATACCCGGGAGCTCATTCCCGAAAAAACTCGG; SacI underlined) and (−133) (ATTCCCGGGTCTAGACACATTCGCTGACTTTGCC; XbaI underlined), and the template was pMLO16 (9.Ilmén M. Onnela M.-L. Klemsdal S. Keränen S. Penttilä M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 303-314PubMed Google Scholar). The polylinker region present in pAS1 caused some leaky expression of the HIS3 gene, and a more proper negative control plasmid pMS95 was constructed as follows. Plasmid pAS1 was digested withSacI and a 1.4-kb SacI fragment from a nonrelevant cDNA (5′end of a glutamate receptor cDNA from rat) was ligated in front of the HIS3 gene. The T. reesei expression cDNA library of 105independent clones was constructed in E. coli as described (19.Saloheimo A. Henrissat B. Hoffrén A.-M. Teleman O. Penttilä M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). RNA from the T. reesei Rut-C30 strain was used as a template. The yeast multicopy vector pAJ401 used contains the yeastURA3 marker and the constitutive PGK promoter of yeast, which provides expression signals for the cDNA insert. The DBY746 yeast strain harboring the pAS3 reporter plasmid was transformed by electroporation according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Electroporation with the total of 40 μg of the plasmid pool gave a library of 106 yeast cells. In order to screen His+ colonies, the library was plated on SC-Leu-Ura-His plates to a density of 106 cells per plate and grown at 30 °C for 5 days. 0.004% of the transformed yeast cells could grow in the selection conditions. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the growing colonies and transformed to the DBY746 yeast strain and the strains with the reporter construct and the negative control plasmid. Plasmids that supported growth on the SC-Leu-Ura-His plates only together with the reporter plasmid pAS3 were analyzed further. E. coli was transformed by electroporation according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Yeast transformation was done either with electroporation (Bio-Rad) or by using the improved lithium acetate method of Gietz et al. (23.Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Protoplast transformation ofT. reesei (20.Penttilä M. Nevalainen H. Rättö M. Salminen E. Knowles J.K.C. Gene. 1987; 61: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) was performed by selecting transformants for growth on acetamide as the sole nitrogen source. T. reeseichromosomal DNA and total RNA were isolated as described earlier (24.Raeder U. Broda P. Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 1985; 1: 17-20Crossref Scopus (1381) Google Scholar,25.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Southern and Northern hybridizations were carried out using standard methods. The full-length ace1 cDNA was isolated from a cellulase-induced T. reesei Rut-C30 λZAP library (26.Stålbrand H. Saloheimo A. Vehmaanperä J. Henrissat B. Penttilä M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1090-1097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a 300-bp PCR fragment from the 5′ end of the original non-full-length cDNA as a probe by plaque hybridization according to the λZAP manual (Stratagene). The genomic ace1 copy was isolated from the cosmid library of T. reesei VTT-D-80133 (27.Mäntylä A.L. Rossi K.H. Vanhanen S.A. Penttilä M.E. Suominen P.L. Nevalainen K.M.H. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) using the ace1 coding sequence as a probe in colony hybridization (28.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A 7-kb HindIII fragment was subcloned into the HindIII site of the pZErO-1 vector (Invitrogen) resulting in the plasmid pAS34. The DNA binding domain of ACEI was produced as a GST fusion in E. coli for binding studies. To construct the GST-ACEI fusion expression vector, a DNA fragment encompassing the ACEI DNA binding domain (amino acids 382–528) was amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-AGCGCGGATCCATGCGGTCCATGGCCCGCCG-3′ and 5′AGCCGGAATTCGTAGCTGGGCGTGGAGGAAG-3′ (BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites underlined) and cloned in-frame into theBamHI-EcoRI-cut pGEX-2T plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), resulting in plasmid pARO18. E. coliBL21(DE3) cells transformed with pARO18 were grown toA 600 = 0.7, and production of the GST-ACEI382–582 fusion protein was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 1 mm. Cells were harvested and broken by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The fusion protein contained in the supernatant was affinity-purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted in 5 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). For some experiments, the ACEI382–582 domain was cleaved from the GST moiety by thrombin (20 units of thrombin/mg of fusion protein), and the cleavage was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. DNA-protein binding reactions were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C in 20 μl of 10 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm ZnCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 μg/ml poly(dI·dC) with 0.25–0.5 μg of the GST-ACEI382–582fusion protein and 0.5–1 ng (about 50,000 cpm) of the labeled double-stranded DNA. In competition experiments, unlabeled DNA was added into the reaction in a 20–200-fold excess over the labeled oligonucleotide. The DNA-protein complexes were separated on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 10% (v/v) glycerol in 12.5 mm Tris-borate buffer (pH 8.3). Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed producing a hybrid with a recessed 3′ end in the coding strand that was filled in with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. Fragments longer than 100 bp were amplified by PCR using sequence-specific primers, digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, gel-purified, and labeled as described above. Binding of ACEI382–582to a 170-bp fragment of the cbh1 promoter was assessed in by using the Matchmaker one-hybrid system (CLONTECH). For the construction of a target-reporter yeast strain, acbh1 promoter fragment corresponding to nucleotides from −843 to −676 was amplified by PCR with primers GAGAGAGAGCTCCTGGAAAATACAAACCAATGGC (forward) and GAGAGAGAGCTCAGAAACAAACGTGGGGAAGTG (reverse) flanked by SacI sites (underlined). The PCR product was cloned into the SacI site of pHisi-1 (CLONTECH). The resulting plasmid, pPL2, contained two tandem copies of the insert in reverse orientation. pPL2 and pHisi-1 were linearized and transformed into the S. cerevisiae strain YM4271 by the lithium acetate method, and the transformants were selected on SC-His plates for integration of the target-reporter construct into the HIS3locus. For the in vivo binding experiments, the DNA binding domain of ACEI from pARO18 (see above) was cloned intoBamHI-EcoRI cut pGAD10 expression vector (CLONTECH) of the Matchmaker two-hybrid system, which generates a hybrid protein that contains the GAL4 activation domain in the N terminus. The GAL4ad-ACEI382–582expression construct was named pARO20. Subsequently, the Leu-selectable plasmids pARO20 and pGAD10 were transformed into the pPL2/YM4271 and pHisi-1/YM4271 reporter yeasts, and transformants were selected on SC-His-Leu plates. The test plates for GAL4ad-ACEI382–582binding and activation were SC-His-Leu supplemented with 45 mm 3-aminotriazol to prevent leaky expression fromHIS3. For disruption of theace1 gene from the fungal genome, plasmid pAS38 was constructed as follows. The protein coding region of theace1 chromosomal gene, except for the last 150 bp, was removed from the pAS34 plasmid by digestion with the restriction enzymes BglII and NarI. This region was replaced with the amdS gene of Aspergillus nidulansexcised from the p3SR2 plasmid with the restriction enzymesSphI and XbaI. Prior to ligation, the fragments were filled in with the T4 DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Plasmid pAS38 was digested with the restriction enzymeHindIII, and the disruption cassette containing theamdS transformation marker flanked with fragments of about 2.5 kb from the 5′and 3′ends of the ace1 gene was isolated from the gel and transformed to Trichoderma. The transformants were screened by Southern hybridization for the replacement of the ace1 gene. All procedures not described above were carried out using standard methods (e.g. Ref. 28.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A genetic selection method was developed for cloning of positive-acting transcriptional regulatory genes in S. cerevisiae, and it was applied for the isolation of activators of cellulase genes ofT. reesei. First, a yeast reporter plasmid was constructed in which the promoter of the T. reesei major cellulase genecbh1 was fused to a promoterless S. cerevisiae HIS3 gene, thus bringing HIS3 expression under the control of the cbh1 promoter. A 1.15-kb promoter fragment located immediately upstream of the cbh1 TATA box was inserted in front of the yeast HIS3 reporter gene, which lacked upstream regulatory sequences but contained the TATA box and the sequences downstream. The resulting LEU2-selectable single copy yeast plasmid pAS3 was transformed into the yeast strain DBY746. The reporter strain DBY746-pAS3 could not grow on media lacking histidine, showing that the Trichoderma promoter could not drive expression of the reporter gene by itself. In order to exclude the possibility that HIS3 was not expressed because theS. cerevisiae glucose repressor protein MIG1, which recognizes similar sequence elements as present in the cbh1promoter, repressed the reporter construct, pAS3 was transformed into amig1 deletion strain. The pAS3 construct remained silent, demonstrating that MIG1 did not repress the promoter and that yeast-encoded factors alone could not activate the reporter construct. In order to isolate T. reesei cDNAs that would activate transcription from the cbh1-HIS3 construct, a cDNA ofT. reesei was introduced into the reporter yeast. The cDNA library of T. reesei grown in cellulase-inducing conditions was prepared into a URA3-selectable multicopy yeast expression vector pAJ401 under the strong constitutivePGK promoter (19.Saloheimo A. Henrissat B. Hoffrén A.-M. Teleman O. Penttilä M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A subset of the expression library containing 105 independent clones was transformed into the reporter yeast strain DBY746-pAS3, resulting in 106 yeast colonies growing on media lacking leucine and uracil. The colonies were scraped from the plates and screened on plates lacking histidine, leucine, and uracil. Growing colonies were detected with the frequency of 4:100 000. Plasmids were recovered from the growing colonies and retransformed into the reporter yeast strain, into the yeast strain containing the negative control plasmid pMS95, and into the host strain DBY746. Most of the plasmids supported growth of all the strains on media lacking histidine. These clones contained the T. reesei his3 gene as verified by partial sequencing followed by homology comparison of the open reading frame against the yeast andNeurospora his3 genes. 15% of the plasmids could not support growth of any of the strains and thus represented false positives. One of the remaining plasmids (pAS27) contained a 2-kb cDNA insert and supported slow growth of the reporter strain but not of the negative control or the host strain on media lacking histidine (Fig. 1). The cDNA was studied further, and the gene was named ace1(activator of cellulaseexpression). Sequencing of the ace1 cDNA from the pAS27 plasmid revealed a 1943-bp cDNA with an open reading frame of 491 amino acids starting from the first ATG codon in the insert. Northern hybridization using the cDNA as a probe gave two signals of about 3.2 and 3.0 kb in length (data not shown) and thus showed that the cDNA was not full-length. Therefore, the full-length cDNA of the ace1 gene was isolated from a library prepared in λZAP from the same inducedTrichoderma cDNA as used in the initial screening. A 300-bp PCR fragment from the 5′ end of the original cDNA was used as a probe in plaque hybridization. The resulting plasmid pAS28 contained a cDNA insert of 3223 bp, which is in good accordance with the estimated size of the longest mRNA. The open reading frame of 733 amino acids starting from the first ATG codon of the cDNA maintains the frame of the original open reading frame and contains 242 additional amino acids. There is a rather long, 611-bp, nontranslated 5′ leader sequence in the cDNA. The existence of three in-frame stop codons before the first ATG in the cDNA confirms that the plasmid contains the whole protein coding sequence of theace1 gene. The ace1 gene sequence and the deduced protein sequence are shown in Fig. 2. Amino acids 387–403 form a putative bipartite nuclear targeting signalRRKKNATPEDVAPKKCR (basic residues are shown in boldface), fitting well to the consensus (29.Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). Partially overlapping with the nuclear targeting signal follows an area containing three zinc fingers of the Cys2-His2type. The original PROSITE pattern C2H2recognizes the first Cys2-His2 finger of ACEI, and an extended pattern (C2H2can; Ref. 30.Böhm S. Frishman D. Mewes W Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2464-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) recognizes the third finger that contains a serine instead of the conserved hydrophobic amino acid of the original pattern. The middle finger of ACEI has a 15-amino acid-long loop instead of the usual 12 amino acids between the conserved zinc-coordinating second Cys and first His. The distribution of acidic and bulky nonpolar residues between amino acids 373–388 and 666–682 suggests that amphipatic α-helices characteristic of several transcription activation domains may be formed (31.Cohen C.

RME1 also contains three zinc fingers, the second of which has a 15-amino acid central loop as ACEI, but the amino acid sequences of the fingers are quite different. The third finger showed similarity to the MSS1 protein of S. cerevisiae (39.Ahn J.H. Park S.H. Kang H.S. Mol. Gen.

Outside the zinc finger region, no meaningful similarities with known proteins could be detected. DNA and protein sequence comparisons against the A. nidulans and Neurospora crassa expressed sequence tag data bases detected fourAspergillus clones (n8h08a1.r1, c3b04a1.r1, w4e06a1.r1, g6h12a1.r1), three of which are partially overlapping, and oneNeurospora clone (b306ne.f1). All five of these clones have clear similarity with T. reesei ACEI, suggesting that homologues of ace1 are expressed in other filamentous fungi. Amino acid sequence alignment of these clones with T. reeseiACEI is shown in Fig. 3. Chromosomal DNA isolated from different T. reesei strains, including hypercellulolytic and cellulase-negative strains (15.Nevalainen K.M.H. Palva E.T. Appl. Environ.

Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel sPLA2 that is the sixth isoform of the sPLA2family found in humans. The novel human mature sPLA2consists of 123 amino acids (M r = 14,000) and is most similar to group IIA sPLA2 (sPLA2-IIA) with respect to the number and positions of cysteine residues as well as overall identity (51%). Therefore, this novel sPLA2should be categorized into group II and called group IIE (sPLA2-IIE) following the recently identified group IID sPLA2 (sPLA2-IID). The enzymatic properties of recombinant human sPLA2-IIE were almost identical to those of sPLA2-IIA and IID in terms of Ca2+requirement, optimal pH, substrate specificity, as well as high susceptibility to the sPLA2 inhibitor indoxam. Along with the biochemical properties of proteins, genetic and evolutional similarities were also observed among these three types of group II sPLA2s as to the chromosomal location of the human gene (1p36) and the exon/intron organization. The expression of sPLA2-IIE transcripts in humans was restricted to the brain, heart, lung, and placenta in contrast to broad expression profiles for sPLA2-IIA and -IID. In sPLA2-IIA-deficient mice, the expression of sPLA2-IIE was markedly enhanced in the lung and small intestine upon endotoxin challenge, which contrasted with the reduced expression of sPLA2-IID mRNA. In situhybridization analysis revealed elevation of sPLA2-IIE mRNA at alveolar macrophage-like cells in the lung of endotoxin-treated mice. These findings suggest a distinct functional role of novel sPLA2-IIE in the progression of inflammatory processes.

PLA2s participate in pathophysiological processes by releasing arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids leading to the production of various types of proinflammatory lipid mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes (3.Dennis E.A.

To date, several mammalian intracellular and secretory PLA2s (sPLA2s) have been characterized and classified into different families according to their biochemical features (5.Dennis E.A.

Intracellular PLA2s comprise the Ca2+-sensitive arachidonoyl-specific 85-kDa cytosolic PLA2 and a number of Ca2+-independent PLA2s (5.Dennis E.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). In contrast, sPLA2s have several common characteristics including a relatively low molecular mass (13–18 kDa), the presence of 6–8 disulfide bridges, an absolute catalytic requirement for millimolar concentrations of Ca2+, and a broad specificity for phospholipids with different polar head groups and fatty acid chains (4.Lambeau G.

At present, five distinct sPLA2s have been identified in humans and classified into different groups (group IB, IIA, IID, V, and X) depending on the primary structure characterized by the number and positions of cysteine residues (7.Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17247-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), while group IIC sPLA2found in rodents is a pseudogene in humans (8.Tischfield J.A. Xia Y.R.

Among them, group IIA sPLA2 (sPLA2-IIA) is thought to be one of the key enzymes in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, since its local and systemic levels are elevated in diseases, such as septic shock, acute pancreatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis (9.Green J.-A.

Immunol. 1985; 135: 2443-2451PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a potent sPLA2-specific inhibitor, indoxam (16.Yokota Y. Hanasaki K. Ono T. Nakazato H. Kobayashi T. Arita H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 18: 213-222Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), was reported to suppress endotoxin-induced lethal effects as well as inflammatory cytokine production with a similar potency for sPLA2-IIA-expressing and sPLA2-IIA-deficient mouse strains (16.Yokota Y. Hanasaki K. Ono T. Nakazato H. Kobayashi T. Arita H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 18: 213-222Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice expressing the human sPLA2-IIA gene do not develop any overt inflammatory conditions (17.Grass D.S. Felkner R.H. Chiang M.-Y. Wallace R.E. Nevalainen T.J. Bennet C.F. Swanson M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These findings point to the need to reassess the role of sPLA2-IIA in inflammatory diseases and suggest that other types of sPLA2 including some unidentified isoforms may play a compensatory role. For example, the most classical sPLA2, group IB sPLA2 (sPLA2-IB), has long been thought to act as a digestive enzyme because of its abundance in digestive organs (18.de Haas G.H. Postema N.M. Nieuwenhuizen W. van Deenen L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 159: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have identified sPLA2-IB as a signaling molecule that induces the lipid mediator releases via binding to its specific receptor, the PLA2-receptor (19.Arita H. Hanasaki K.

Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 162-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), our studies with mice deficient in both PLA2 receptor and sPLA2-IIA have demonstrated a potential role of sPLA2-IB/PLA2 receptor-mediated responses in the production of inflammatory cytokines during the progression of endotoxic shock (26.Hanasaki K. Yokota Y. Ishizaki J. Itoh T. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32792-32797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recent advances in molecular biology and the growing amount of genetic information have led to the identification of several novel types of sPLA2s. Chen et al. (27.Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2365-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) discovered group V sPLA2 (sPLA2-V) from a human genomic DNA fragment similar to the sPLA2-IIA gene. sPLA2-V hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine (PC) more effectively than sPLA2-IIA to induce the release of lipid mediators in several mammalian cells (28.Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11881-11888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cupillard et al. (29.Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.-G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol.

We have recently shown its strong potency for the release of arachidonic acid from several human myeloid leukemia cells (30.Hanasaki K. Ono T. Saiga A. Morioka Y. Ikeda M. Kawamoto K. Higashino K.

The expression of sPLA2-IID mRNA is enhanced in the thymus of rats and sPLA2-IIA-deficient mice upon endotoxin challenge, suggesting its potential role in the progression of endotoxic shock (32.Ishizaki J.

Identification of the entire set of sPLA2 family members and elucidation of the relative contribution of each isoform to various cellular responses are critical to understanding the precise roles of the sPLA2 family in physiological and pathological processes. In light of the growing molecular diversity of sPLA2s, we searched the DNA data base and encountered an expressed sequence tag that could represent part of a new sPLA2 isoform. Here, we report the cloning of a cDNA encoding a novel human sPLA2, which we called group IIE sPLA2(sPLA2-IIE) based on its structural properties. We characterized the enzymatic properties of recombinant human sPLA2-IIE, and we compared its expression profiles in humans as well as in endotoxin-treated mice with those of the other sPLA2s. Such comprehensive structural information and the availability of recombinant proteins of six types of human sPLA2s should enable assessment of the relative contribution and closer study of the biological roles of each isoform in various disease states. Human genomic DNA was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. YAC clone (957 F 12) was distributed from Center d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (Paris, France). All oligonucleotides were purchased from Kokusai Shiyaku KK (Kobe, Japan). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Salmonella typhosa 0901) was from Difco. 1-Palmitoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PLPE) were obtained from Sigma. Other synthetic phospholipids used in the assay for substrate specificity, including 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. 1-Palmitoyl-2-[14C]-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ([14C]-POPC) (55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Indoxam was synthesized at Shionogi Research Laboratories (33.Hagishita S. Yamada M. Shirahase K. Okuda T. Murakami Y. Ito Y. Matsuura T. Wada M. Kato T. Ueno M. Chikazawa Y. Yamada K. Ono T.

Computational analysis on the isolated cDNAs and related sequences were performed with the GENETYX program (Software Development Co., Ltd.). Mouse gene fragment of sPLA2-IIE was discovered by a tBLASTn search (34.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59762) Google Scholar) against GenBankTM data base using an 11-amino acid sequence (DRCCVTHDCCY) around the catalytic center of the mouse sPLA2-IIA (13.Kennedy B.P.

A cDNA fragment corresponding to the identified gene sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Reverse-transcribed cDNAs from various tissues of B57BL/6J mice (one of the sPLA2-IIA-deficient strains (12.MacPhee M. Chepenik K.P. Liddell R.A. Nelson K.K. Siracusa L.D. Buchberg A.M.

Primers for amplification were 5′-cttcaagagangagggaaacctg-3′, 5′-tcaagagangagggaaacctgcc-3′ (sense), and 5′-agcttgttggggtagtgggc-3′, 5′-cttgttggggtagtgggcata-3′ (antisense). Two rounds of amplifications (nested PCR) were carried out with these primers and ExTaq (Takara, Japan). Amplification conditions were 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. The PCR products were separated on agarose gel, and DNA of the expected size was isolated. The recombinant plasmid was then constructed with pCRII cloning vector (Invitrogen), purified with GFX Micro Plasmid Prep Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and sequenced with Applied Biosystems PRISM 310 genetic analyzer. From the determined DNA sequence, new primers were designed for the isolation of 5′ and 3′ portions of the cDNA. The cloning of these remaining parts was performed with the protocol of “rapid amplification of the cDNA end” (RACE) using mouse spleen marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions with a slight modification (ExTaq was used instead of KlenTaq polymerase). The 5′-end could not be obtained with single RACE, and successive RACE was performed to cover the initial ATG codon. The full-length cDNA was isolated by PCR with end primers, 5′-agaaaagagacctctctca-3′, 5′-tagacggtgactcagagctgca-3′ (sense), and 5′-ggaaaatagacttctcttattcag-3′, 5′-agggtattgagatgccagaggc-3′ (antisense). Human genomic DNA and yeast strain harboring YAC (957 F 12) was used as a template for the PCR to isolate the genomic fragments of novel human sPLA2-IIE genes. Samples of 200 ng of human genomic DNA or yeast colony suspension were subjected to PCR with two primers, 5′-cta(ct)ggctg(ct)(ct)a(ct)tg(ct)gg-3′ and 5′-g(ctg)(ct)c(ga)tagca(ga)cagtcatg-3′ and ExTaq. Thermal conditions were 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. All of the amplified bands were isolated, and their sequences were determined. Three of them were identified as corresponding to sPLA2-IIA, -IID, and the novel type of sPLA2 genes (∼350, 800, and 300 base pairs, respectively), all of which contained one intron at the same position. Based on the determined sequence, isolation of human sPLA2-IIE cDNA was attempted with the strategy used to clone the mouse sPLA2-IIE cDNA with marathon-ready cDNA from human small intestine (CLONTECH). Two sets of primers were designed to isolate the corresponding cDNA. For 5′-extension, 5′-tggcagcaccagtcagtctg-3′ and 5′-agtctggtccaccggccagtg-3′ were successively used with fixed primers corresponding to the adapter sequence attached to the 5′ terminus of the cDNA. For 3′-extension, four primers were used, 5′-ggcatcggtggtccccactgg-3′ and 5′-tcccactggccggtggaccag-3′, 5′-ggggtggctatgggagccgagc-3′ and 5′-gctatggagccgagcagggcc-3′. The latter two primers were derived from the mouse sPLA2-IIE cDNA sequence at the 3′-noncoding region. The existence and positions of the intron of human sPLA2-IIE gene were analyzed using several primers. The sequence of the amplified DNA from human genomic DNA was compared with that of the cDNA. Separately amplified genomic portions were arranged to cover the whole region of the open reading frame. An identical amplification pattern of the genomic fragment was observed using the YAC (957 F 12) DNA as a template. Two successive PCRs were performed to amplify human sPLA2-IIE cDNA from small intestine cDNA. The first PCR was done with 5′-atgaaatctccccacgtgctgg-3′ and 5′-tcagcagggcggggtggg-3′, and the second with 5′-agtagttgatgcggccgccaccatgaaatctccccacgtgctggtgttc-3′ and 5′-taagcttttctagatcagcagggcggggtgggcccggtgcacag-3′. The upstream primer has a NotI recognition site and Kozak sequence (in italic). The downstream primer has a XbaI recognition site. The sPLA2-IIE cDNA thus amplified was digested withNotI and XbaI and inserted into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) to construct the expression plasmids. After sequencing confirmation, 18 μg of recombinant plasmid was transfected into 50% confluent COS-7 cells grown in 148-cm2 Petri dishes with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the culture medium was collected after 3 days. PLA2 activities in the culture medium and cell fractions were then measured with [3H]oleate-labeled Escherichia coli membranes as a substrate (35.Furue S. Hori Y. Kuwabara K. Ikeuchi J. Onoyama H. Yamamoto M. Tanaka K. Gut. 1997; 41: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The recombinant human sPLA2-IIE was partially purified from the culture supernatant by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; the sPLA2 activity was eluted with 1 m NaCl) and characterized with respect to the Ca2+ dependence and pH optimum as described previously (32.Ishizaki J.

Partially purified human sPLA2-IIE was subjected to individual reactions with 13 types of commercially available phospholipids as a substrate, as described previously (32.Ishizaki J. Suzuki N.

The hydrolysis rates within the linear range of the enzymatic assay of each sPLA2 were determined. In separate experiments, human sPLA2-IIE was subjected to reactions with mixed phospholipids composed of four types of PCs or three types of PEs with different fatty acid chains at thesn-2 position (oleic acid, linoleic acid, and arachidonic acid in PC and PE or docosahexaenoic acid in PC), as described in our previous paper (32.Ishizaki J.

The released fatty acids were quantified according to the method of Tojo et al. (36.Tojo H. Ono T. Okamoto M. J. Lipid. Res. 1993; 34: 837-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory potencies of sPLA2 inhibitor, indoxam, against six types of human sPLA2s were evaluated as follows. Purified recombinant proteins of human sPLA2-IB and non-glycosylated sPLA2-X were prepared as described previously (30.Hanasaki K. Ono T. Saiga A. Morioka Y. Ikeda M. Kawamoto K. Higashino K.

Recombinant sPLA2-IIA was a generous gift from Dr. Ruth Kramer (Lilly). The conditioned medium containing recombinant human sPLA2-V or sPLA2-IID protein was, respectively, prepared from the stably expressing CHO clone, as described previously (30.Hanasaki K. Ono T. Saiga A. Morioka Y. Ikeda M. Kawamoto K. Higashino K. Nakano K. Yamada K. Ishizaki J. Arita H. J. Biol.

In this experiment, PLA2 activity was determined by measuring the release of radiolabeled oleic acid from [14C]POPC, as described by Draheim et al. (37.Draheim S.E. Bach N.J. Dillard R.D. Berry D.R. Carlson D.G. Chirgadze N.Y. Clawson D.K. Hartley L.W. Johnson L.M. Jones N.D. McKinney E.R. Mihelich E.D. Olkowski J.L. Schevitz R.W. Smith A.C. Snyder D.W. Sommers C.D. Wery J.-P. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 5159-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, the substrate was used in the form of mixed micelles of 1 mm POPC (100,000 cpm [14C]POPC and cold POPC) and 3 mm sodium deoxycholate. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the substrate. Six types of human sPLA2 preparations (2 ng of sPLA2-IB, 10 ng of sPLA2-IIA, 4 ng of non-glycosylated sPLA2-X, 2 μl of sPLA2-IID, 0.2 μl of sPLA2-IIE, and 40 μl of sPLA2-V) were incubated with the reaction mixture in the presence of various concentrations of indoxam for 60 min at 40 °C in a final volume of 200 μl. Each enzyme reaction was linear during this incubation time. Control incubation in the absence of sPLA2 was carried out in parallel and used to calculate the specific hydrolysis. Human cDNAs transcribed from mRNAs of various tissues (Multiple Tissue cDNA Panels, K1420-1, K1421-1, CLONTECH) were used as templates for PCR for each sPLA2 subtype. sPLA2-IB, -IIA, and -V cDNAs were amplified with a single round of PCR (35 cycles), and sPLA2-IID, -IIE, and -X cDNAs were amplified by two rounds of PCR (30 cycles each). Primers used were as follows: IB, 5′-gaccccttcttggaatacaacaac-3′ and 5′-actctgacaatacttcttggtgtc-3′; IIA, 5′- ttgacgacaggaaaggaagccgca-3′ and 5′-gctccctctgcagtgtttattgga-3′; V, 5′-gctgtgcaaggaggcttgctggac-3′ and 5′-gttgggaaagtattggtactgggt-3′; IID, 5′-atggaacttgcactgctgtgtg-3′ and 5′-ctagcacccaggggtctgcccc-3′ for the 1st round; 5′-tggtggtgatggctggtgtga-3′ and 5′-ccgccagtagaaacgcagtcg-3′ for the 2nd round; IIE, 5′-atgaaatctccccacgtgctgg-3′ and 5′-tcagcagggcggggtggg-3′ for the 1st round; 5′-tctccccacgtgctggtgttc-3′ and 5′-cggggtgggcccggtgca-3′ for the 2nd round; X, 5′-gaactggcaggaactgtgggt-3′ and 5′-tagtcagtcacacttgggcga-3′ for the 1st round; and 5′-cgaacccccatcgcctatatg-3′ and 5′-gtccggcacacataggaactg-3′ for the 2nd round. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) was used as an internal standard (5′-tccaccaccctgttgctgtag-3′ and 5′-gaccacagtccatgccatcact-3′; 30 cycles). PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Analysis with Master blot membranes containing poly(A)+ RNAs from various human tissues (7770-1CLONTECH) was performed by hybridization at high stringency with 32P-labeling human sPLA2-IIE cDNA probe. LPS (S. typhosa 0901) was injected intraperitoneally into C57BL/6J mice at a dosage of 10 mg/kg, and total RNA was extracted from various tissues after 24 h with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). mRNA was then purified with QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subjected to Northern analysis (5 μg). The coding region of mouse sPLA2-IIE was cloned into pCRII plasmid, purified after restriction enzyme digestion and subjected to 32P labeling using Megaprime DNA Labeling System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Northern analysis was also performed with mouse sPLA2-IID cDNA probe. The intensity of the signals was quantified with BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film) and normalized with cyclophilin as a control. Antisense and sense single-strand cRNAs were synthesized from sPLA2-IIE cDNA fragments subcloned in pCRII vector. The template was linearized withBamHI (antisense probe) or EcoRV (sense probe), and the labeled RNA probes were synthesized with T7 (antisense) and Sp6 (sense) RNA polymerase in the presence of digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled UTP (DIG Labeling Kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After treatment with LPS or saline for 24 h, mice were flushed with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) through the abdominal aorta followed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Pieces from the removed lungs were immersed in the same fixative at 4 °C overnight and dehydrated by a diluted alcohol followed by xylene. The preparations were then passed into paraffin at 56 °C, and transversal tissue sections (4-μm thick) were mounted on slides freshly coated with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. After dewaxing, the sections were incubated with 0.2 m HCl followed by 1% Triton X-100 and permeabilized with 10 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and acetylated with 0.1 m triethanolamine containing 0.25% acetic anhydride. In situ hybridization was performed essentially according to the method of Lan et al. (38.Lan H.Y. Mu W. Yang N. Meinhardt A. Nikolic-Paterson D.J. Ng Y.Y. Bacher M. Atkins R.C. Bucala R. Am. J.

Briefly, the sections were hybridized with 200 ng/ml DIG-labeled probes for 16 h at 52 °C, and then free labeled cRNA was digested by 10 μg/ml RNase A. The samples were immersed in 1.5% blocking reagent, preincubated in normal mouse serum, and then incubated with sheep anti-DIG antibody.

Some EGF family growth factors play essential roles in human keratinocytes in an autocrine manner. We show here that epiregulin is another autocrine growth factor for human keratinocytes. Epiregulin stimulated human keratinocyte proliferation under both subconfluent and confluent culture conditions in the absence of exogenous EGF family growth factors. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled conditioned medium revealed a 5-kDa band corresponding to epiregulin. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.8-kilobase transcript of epiregulin, and the addition of epiregulin up-regulated epiregulin mRNA synthesis. Furthermore, an anti-epiregulin blocking antibody reduced DNA synthesis by 25%. Epiregulin up-regulated the mRNA levels of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), amphiregulin, and TGF-α. In turn, the addition of EGF, HB-EGF, amphiregulin, and TGF-α increased epiregulin mRNA levels. These results demonstrate that epiregulin acts as an autocrine growth factor in human epidermal keratinocytes and is part of auto- and cross-induction mechanisms involving HB-EGF, amphiregulin, and TGF-α. The mRNA expression profile resulting from induction of differentiation with high calcium and fetal calf serum revealed the differential expression of epiregulin, HB-EGF, amphiregulin, and TGF-α in keratinocytes. This indicates that these four growth factors have distinct, non-redundant biological functions.

The coding sequence of human epiregulin cDNA predicts a 46-amino acid single-chain polypeptide, exhibiting 24–50% homology with the sequences of other EGF receptor (EGFR)-ligands. It binds to ErbB1 (EGFR) and is a potent mitogen for rat primary hepatocytes. Epiregulin exhibits a bifunctional regulatory property in that it inhibits the growth of several epithelial cell lines and stimulates the growth of fibroblasts and various other cell types (1.Toyoda H.

All members of the EGF family share six similarly spaced, conserved cysteine residues, have one or more EGF domains, and also have a transmembrane domain. The membrane-anchored precursor of the EGF family is enzymatically processed externally to release a mature soluble form that acts as a paracrine growth factor. Some members of the EGF family act as a juxtacrine growth factor in the membrane-anchored form. EGF-related peptides trigger an intracellular signaling cascade upon binding to their receptors, causing changes within the target cells. There are four types of EGF receptors: ErbB1, also referred to as EGFR or Her1, ErbB2 (Neu/Her2), ErbB3 (Her3), and ErbB4 (Her4) (12.Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W.

The members of the EGF family are divided into two groups based on their receptor affinities. One group includes EGF, HB-EGF, TGF-α, AR, BTC, and epiregulin, which all bind ErbB1. HB-EGF, epiregulin, and BTC are known to bind to ErbB4 as well as ErbB1 (16.Elenius K. Paul S. Allison G. Sun J. Klagsbrun M.

Dermatol. 1992; 19: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The most important growth factors for normal human keratinocyte proliferation are members of the EGF family, including TGF-α, HB-EGF, and AR. These three EGF members are produced and secreted by keratinocytes and act as autocrine growth factors (33.Coffey Jr., R.J. Derynck R. Wilcox J.N. Bringman T.S. Goustin A.S. Moses H.L. Pittelkow M.R.

However, there has been no study on the role of epiregulin in keratinocyte proliferation. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate that epiregulin acts as an autocrine growth factor in normal human keratinocytes and that, along with HB-EGF, AR, and TGF-α, epiregulin forms auto- and cross-induction regulatory mechanisms during normal human keratinocyte growth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mRNA expression profile upon induction of differentiation reveals the differential expression of epiregulin, HB-EGF, AR, and TGF-α in keratinocytes. This indicates that the function of epiregulin is not redundant; it has its own distinct biological function like HB-EGF, AR, and TGF-α.DISCUSSIONHuman keratinocytes are the main component cells of the epidermis and their growth is regulated by both positive and negative mediators (32.Hashimoto K. Yoshikawa K. J. Dermatol. 1992; 19: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Of all these, the most important mechanism for keratinocyte growth is the EGF receptor-ligand system. Epiregulin is a recently described member of the EGF family, which also includes EGF, TGF-α, AR, HB-EGF, BTC, and neuregulins (4.Marquardt H. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Todaro G.J.

This study directly demonstrates that epiregulin is one of the most recently described autocrine growth factors of the EGF family found in normal human keratinocytes. This was determined by the following findings: (i) epiregulin is produced by keratinocytes, (ii) epiregulin stimulates keratinocyte growth, (iii) anti-epiregulin blocking antibody reduces DNA synthesis, and (iv) epiregulin up-regulated its own mRNA production. The addition of epiregulin enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB1, so the autocrine stimulation of keratinocytes by epiregulin is mediated mainly through its interaction with ErbB1 expressed by these cells.Previous publications have shown that EGF-related autocrine growth factors are capable of inducing other EGF growth factors in keratinocytes (34.Hashimoto K. Higashiyama S. Asada H. Hashimura E. Kobayashi T. Sudo K. Nakagawa T. Damm D. Yoshikawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol.

We have shown here that epiregulin increased the levels of TGF-α, HB-EGF, and AR mRNA, and enhanced TGF-α protein production in the culture medium. In turn, epiregulin mRNA synthesis was enhanced by other EGF family members including EGF, TGF-α, AR, and HB-EGF. Furthermore, EGF and HB-EGF both enhanced epiregulin protein production in the culture medium. These results indicate that other members of the EGF family are potent cross-inducers of epiregulin. These findings, taken together, indicate that epiregulin, HB-EGF, AR, and TGF-α interact with each other by a cross-induction mechanism as well as by autocrine induction. The combination of these two mechanisms is very effective in keratinocyte proliferation.The extent of cross induction differs among the four different autocrine growth factors. The greatest induction of epiregulin mRNA synthesis by HB-EGF, AR, and EGF occurred as early as 1 h after their addition, whereas induction by TGF-α was greatest at 3 h. Previous reports have shown that HB-EGF and EGF optimally induce HB-EGF mRNA synthesis at 1 h, whereas TGF-α-induced HB-EGF mRNA synthesis peaks at 6 h (34.Hashimoto K. Higashiyama S. Asada H. Hashimura E. Kobayashi T. Sudo K. Nakagawa T. Damm D. Yoshikawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20060-20066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, induction of differentiation in keratinocytes results in three distinct EGFR ligand production profiles. Epiregulin and HB-EGF expression levels are increased by1 h, with their peak observed at 6 h and both declining to base lines level at 24 h. The increase in TGF-α mRNA levels is delayed compared with epiregulin and HB-EGF. In contrast, AR mRNA levels remain constant until 6 h and then gradually decrease. The differential expression profiles seen in cross-induction and differentiation suggest that these factors have distinct, non-redundant biological functions.Recent findings in other tissues also indicate that these four growth factors each have their own distinct biological functions. Tissue distribution, molecular characteristics, receptor binding, a preference for dimerization, and receptor affinity all differ among the four keratinocyte autocrine growth factors. Among the EGF family members, the structure of epiregulin is most similar to that of TGF-α on the basis of the length of each segment and the location of a single potential N-glycosylation site (1.Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Uchida D. Takayama Y. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7495-7500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). HB-EGF and AR share structural characteristics and both bind heparin; they also both have a juxtacrine as well as paracrine function (38.Higashiyama S. Lau K. Besner G.E. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6205-6212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the tissue distribution of epiregulin mRNA is not identical to that of TGF-α (3.Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Uchida D. Morimoto S. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed that epiregulin mRNA was found predominantly in the placenta and peripheral blood leukocytes and to a lesser extent in the heart. Very faint expression was detected in normal adult bone marrow, ovary, small intestine, colon, lung, and liver. On the other hand, TGF-α mRNA was predominantly expressed in the kidney, pancreas, brain, lung, liver, and placenta (3.Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Uchida D. Morimoto S. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). TGF-α and HB-EGF mature protein were both detected in normal epidermis, and TGF-α mRNA was up-regulated in psoriatic epidermis, which is a hyper-proliferative disorder (39.Valyi Nagy I. Jensen P.J. Albelda S.M. Rodeck U. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 40.Stoll S. Garner W. Elder J. J. Clin.

Science. 1989; 243: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Expression of mature AR protein was undetectable in adult epidermis (42.Piepkorn M. Underwood R.A. Henneman C. Smith L.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 802-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas it was detected in developing fetal skin and overexpressed in psoriatic epidermis (43.Cook P.W. Pittelkow M.R. Keeble W.W. Graves Deal R. Coffey Jr., R.J. Shipley G.D. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3224-3227PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the expression of individual growth factors is quite different and that these EGF-related peptides are involved in different stages of proliferation, differentiation, and development. In terms of receptor binding and dimerization, TGF-α and AR bind to ErbB1 only, whereas epiregulin and HB-EGF are ligands for not only ErbB1 but for ErbB4 as well (16.Elenius K. Paul S. Allison G. Sun J. Klagsbrun M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 17.Komurasaki T. Toyoda H. Uchida D. Morimoto S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2841-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All the EGF-related peptides, except AR, were able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 by forming a heterodimer with ErbB1 (44.Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6071-6076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The ability to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 varied among the four EGF-related peptides. Recent reports have shown that TGF-α/ErbB1-mediated autocrine growth of transformed epithelial cells is dependent on activation of Stat3 (45.Grandis J.R. Drenning S.D. Chakraborty A. Zhou M. Zeng Q. Pitt A.S. Tweardy D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas EGF-induced growth inhibition of A431 cells requires Stat1 activation (46.Bromberg J.F. Fan Z. Brown C. Mendelsohn J. Damell J.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 505-512PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, epiregulin stimulates the growth of rat primary hepatocytes and A31 fibroblasts, but inhibits the growth of several epithelial tumor cells (1.Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Uchida D. Takayama Y. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7495-7500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the activation of different signal transduction pathways following receptor binding by the four autocrine growth factors.Another interesting point is that epiregulin has the broadest specificity of the EGF-related ligands; it not only stimulates homodimers of both ErbB1 and ErbB4, but also activates all possible heterodimeric ErbB complexes (47.Shelly M. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Guarino B.C. Waterman H. Wang L.M. Lyass L. Alimandi M. Kuo A. Bacus S.S. Pierce J.H. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10496-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 48.Riese III, D.J. Komurasaki T. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11288-11294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The binding of epiregulin to most receptors results in the transmission of a more potent mitogenic signal than does the binding of EGF, and this discrepancy is the result of a mechanism that prevents receptor down-regulation, and results in a weak, but prolonged, state of receptor activation. In our experiment on tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB1 by epiregulin and EGF, the induction of phosphorylation by epiregulin was lower than that by EGF. These findings suggest that epiregulin may have a distinct, non-redundant biological function in normal human keratinocyte proliferation, as do other autocrine growth factors.In conclusion, epiregulin is an autocrine growth factor in normal human keratinocytes and organizes epidermal structure by regulating keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation as well as the expression of TGF-α, HB-EGF, and AR. Epiregulin is a novel member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 family initially purified from conditioned medium of the mouse fibroblast-derived tumor cell line NIH-3T3 clone T7 (1.Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Uchida D. Takayama Y. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7495-7500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of human epiregulin cDNA predicts a 46-amino acid single-chain polypeptide, exhibiting 24–50% homology with the sequences of other EGF receptor (EGFR)-ligands. It binds to ErbB1 (EGFR) and is a potent mitogen for rat primary hepatocytes. Epiregulin exhibits a bifunctional regulatory property in that it inhibits the growth of several epithelial cell lines and stimulates the growth of fibroblasts and various other cell types (1.Toyoda H.

J. 1997; 326: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The EGF family consists of EGF, transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), heparin binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), amphiregulin (AR), betacellulin (BTC), neuregulin 1, neuregulin 2, and neuregulin 3 (4.Marquardt H.

All members of the EGF family share six similarly spaced, conserved cysteine residues, have one or more EGF domains, and also have a transmembrane domain. The membrane-anchored precursor of the EGF family is enzymatically processed externally to release a mature soluble form that acts as a paracrine growth factor. Some members of the EGF family act as a juxtacrine growth factor in the membrane-anchored form. EGF-related peptides trigger an intracellular signaling cascade upon binding to their receptors, causing changes within the target cells. There are four types of EGF receptors: ErbB1, also referred to as EGFR or Her1, ErbB2 (Neu/Her2), ErbB3 (Her3), and ErbB4 (Her4) (12.Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W.

The members of the EGF family are divided into two groups based on their receptor affinities. One group includes EGF, HB-EGF, TGF-α, AR, BTC, and epiregulin, which all bind ErbB1. HB-EGF, epiregulin, and BTC are known to bind to ErbB4 as well as ErbB1 (16.Elenius K. Paul S. Allison G. Sun J. Klagsbrun M.

https://openalex.org/W2048503716,"Various types of collagen have been identified as potential ligands for the two mammalian discoidin domain receptor (DDR) tyrosine kinases, DDR1 and DDR2. It is presently unclear whether collagen-induced DDR receptor activation, which occurs with very slow kinetics, involves additional proteins with kinase activity or membrane-anchored proteins serving as coreceptors. In particular, the role of the collagen-binding integrins α1β1 or α2β1 in the DDR activation process is undefined. Here, we provide three lines of evidence suggesting that DDR1 signaling is distinct from integrin activation. First we demonstrate that the enzymatic activity of DDR1 is essential for receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Collagen-induced DDR receptor autophosphorylation can be blocked either by a dominant negative mutant or by a preparation of recombinant extracellular domain. Second, we show DDR1 signals independent of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. In cells that endogenously express both DDR1 and the EGF receptor, stimulation with EGF does not induce DDR activation. Third, we detected full DDR1 activation after collagen stimulation in cells that have been treated with blocking antibodies for α2β1 integrin or in cells with a targeted deletion of the β1 integrin gene. Finally, we show that overexpression of dominant negative DDR1 in the myoblast cell line C2C12 blocks cellular differentiation and the formation of myofibers.

Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). In many cell types, specific integrins act as surface receptors for different types of collagen (2.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar,3.Brugge J.S. Nat. Gen. 1998; 19: 309-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These integrins are heterodimers with an α1, α2, or α10 subunit linked to the β1 subunit and are localized to the focal adhesion complex (4.Kühn K. Eble J. Integrin-Ligand Interaction.

Within this complex, they cluster with serine/threonine kinases, tyrosine kinases, and cytoskeletal proteins (6.Schläpfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Recently, several types of collagen were identified as candidate ligands for the two discoidin domain receptors (DDR),1 DDR1 and DDR2 (7.Vogel W. Gish G. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol.

DDRs are tyrosine kinase receptors that are distinguished by a homology region to the Dictyostelium discoideum protein discoidin in their extracellular region (9.Alves F. Vogel W. Mossie K. Millauer B. Höfler H. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 609-618PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Baumgartner S. Hofmann K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1626-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Whereas DDR1 activation, measured by an increase in tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation, is achieved by all collagens so far tested (type I to type VI), DDR2 is only activated by fibrillar collagens, in particular by collagen type I and type III (7.Vogel W. Gish G. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). In contrast to most other tyrosine kinase receptors, DDR activation follows slow kinetics, and it takes up to 18 h to reach full receptor activity (7.Vogel W. Gish G. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 8.Shrivastava A. Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M. Ryan T.E. Davis S. Goldfarb M.P. Glass D.J.

The b isoform of DDR1 has an additional 37-amino acid sequence inserted by alternatively splicing into the juxtamembrane domain that contains an LXNPXY sequence (9.Alves F. Vogel W. Mossie K. Millauer B. Höfler H. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 609-618PubMed Google Scholar). Upon collagen-mediated receptor activation, the tyrosine in the LXNPXY sequence becomes phosphorylated and provides a binding site for the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Shc (7.Vogel W. Gish G. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). After prolonged activation of DDR2 in human fibrosarcoma cells, an increase in matrix metalloprotease 1 expression was detected (7.Vogel W. Gish G. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Although it has been shown that collagen needs to be in its native, triple-helical configuration to activate DDR, the binding epitopes for the DDR extracellular domain on a collagen molecule and the significance of the discoidin region in collagen binding are not yet defined (7.Vogel W.

Cell. 1997; 91: 869-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Also, it is unclear whether DDR receptors have additional, more conventional ligands. In this study, we have investigated whether other tyrosine kinases except DDR itself are involved in collagen-induced activation and whether other transmembrane proteins are necessary as coreceptors. In particular, we tested the role of the α1β1 and α2β1integrins as previously known receptors for collagen in the activation process of DDR. Rat type I collagen was purchased from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA); all other reagents were from Sigma. Human embryonic kidney fibroblast 293 cells, human mammary carcinoma T-47D cells, and mouse skeletal myoblast C2C12 cells were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection and cultivated under the recommended conditions. In order to differentiate C2C12 cells, the culture medium was switched from 10% fetal calf serum to 2% horse serum. The DDR expression vectors have been described earlier (9.Alves F. Vogel W. Mossie K. Millauer B. Höfler H. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 609-618PubMed Google Scholar). Expression vectors and purification of the recombinant fragments of collagen type V have been published (12.Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced into the DDR1 cDNA using Kunkel mutagenesis. The cDNA coding for amino acids 26–398 of DDR2 were fused with a His tag followed by a melittin secretion signal and expressed in Hi5 insect cells using the pMelBac expression vector system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were lysed by sonication. Recombinant DDR2 extracellular domain (DDR2exd) was purified by nickel chromatography. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the extracellular domains of DDR1 (amino acids 29–186) and DDR2 (amino acids 28–367) using bacterially expressed antigenes (7.Vogel W. Gish G. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Antibodies to DDR1 (amino acids 894–913), MAPK (K-23-G), and vinculin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 and antibodies to α2 and β1integrin were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The antibody against the b isoform of DDR1 was raised using the peptide ALLLSNPAYRLLLATYARC (amino acids 505–523). Semi-confluent 293 cells were transfected by calcium-phosphate precipitation with a cytomegalovirus-based expression vector. Sixteen hours later, cells were transferred to serum-free media for a further 24 h. Cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml collagen for 90 min and lysed with 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The cellular lysates were centrifuged 10 min at 4 °C, and 13,000 rpm and aliquots of the supernatant were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or further analyzed by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The immunocomplex was washed three times with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton, 10% glycerol and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and immunoblotted with antibodies diluted 1:500 in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% gelatin overnight. Western blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For reprobing, the membrane was stripped in 70 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol at 55 °C for 30 min. the cell adhesion assay was performed as described earlier (13.Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Wu J.E Staatz W.D. Saelman E.U.M. Keely P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 147-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In brief, equal amounts of solubilized T-47D cells were incubated with antibodies against α2 or β1 integrin or left untreated for 15 min at 37 °C and plated on collagen-coated dishes for various times. As control, cells were plated on plastic only. Non-adherent cells were removed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline. After incubating with 3.75 mm p-nitrophenol-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide in 0.25% Triton X-100 for 1 h, the assay was developed by adding 50 mm glycine, 5 mm EDTA (pH 10.4) and the absorbency measured at 405 nm. Assays were performed in quadruplicate. The standard deviation was less than 10% of each value. GD25-DDR1b were grown on coverslips for 3 days, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated with DDR1b and vinculin antibodies in 1:25 concentration. Fluorographic detection was performed by Texas-Red- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibodies. To determine whether integrin-associated tyrosine kinase activity is involved in DDR signaling, we mutated lysine 618 in the catalytic domain of DDR1a to alanine. Mutant and wild-type cDNAs were transiently overexpressed in human embryonic kidney fibroblast 293 cells. Whereas wild-type DDR1a was highly tyrosine phosphorylated after stimulation with collagen, the K618A mutant failed to respond to collagen (Fig. 1 A). This suggests that DDR tyrosine phosphorylation requires autocatalytic activity and is not entirely mediated by any of the integrin-associated tyrosine kinases such as Fak, Pyk2, or Syk (6.Schläpfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). If DDR receptors function as typical receptor tyrosine kinases, ligand binding would be expected to induce receptor oligomerization, followed by transphosphorylation. We tested this by generating a truncated form of DDR1 that lacks the catalytic domain (K529*). Cotransfection of full-length DDR1b together with increasing amounts of truncated receptor showed that receptor phosphorylation in response to collagen is efficiently blocked in the presence of higher amounts of the K529* mutant (Fig. 1 B). A significant reduction of DDR1 phosphorylation was already observed by expressing equal amounts of wild-type and dominant negative DDR1 receptor. A 4-fold excess of dominant negative over wild-type DDR1 completely abolished DDR1 phosphorylation. In order to examine DDR2 signaling, we purified recombinant extracellular domain of DDR2 (DDR2exd) from overexpressing insect cells. 293 cells expressing DDR2 were stimulated with collagen in the presence of increasing amounts of DDR2exd. Subsequent analysis of DDR2 tyrosine phosphorylation showed that receptor activation could be efficiently suppressed by recombinant DDR2exd (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, the activation of DDR1 was unchanged by DDR2exd (Fig.1 D), raising the possibility that the two DDR receptors recognize distinct binding epitopes on a collagen molecule. Taken together, these data are consistent with the view that DDR1 and DDR2 activation follows established schemes although with slow kinetics. We next examined DDR1 tyrosine phosphorylation in the human mammary carcinoma cell line T-47D, which endogenously expresses the receptor. Overnight incubation of T-47D cells with collagen type I or type V resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of DDR1b (7.Vogel W. Gish G. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). To explore further the requirements for DDR1 activation, we used recombinantly expressed, triple helical portions of collagen type V to stimulate T-47D cells (12.Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A short fragment of the COL1 domain of collagen type V (HepV, amino acids 824–950) that resembles the heparin-binding site in collagen type V was not able to induce DDR1b tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, a recombinant collagen molecule consisting of the entire COL1 domain of collagen type V (α1TH, amino acids 559–1573) stimulated DDR1b tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A). The extent of DDR1 phosphorylation by recombinant collagen was comparable to the phosphorylation by native type I collagen. It is important to know whether DDR1 activity in T-47D cells can be modulated by other receptor tyrosine kinases also found in T-47D cells such as the epidermal growth factor receptor. Immunopurification of DDR1b from cells stimulated with EGF showed no tyrosine phosphorylation of DDR1b (Fig. 2 B), whereas stimulation with collagen resulted in robust DDR1b tyrosine phosphorylation. Applying EGF and collagen simultaneously did not have any synergistic effect on DDR1b phosphorylation. To investigate downstream effects of activated tyrosine kinase receptors, we analyzed MAPK phosphorylation as a convenient readout for Ras-mediated stimulation of cell proliferation. Interestingly, MAPK is not activated upon DDR stimulation by collagen but is fully activated in response to EGF (Fig. 2 C). Activation of cells by collagen together with EGF did not show any inhibitory function of DDR1b on EGF-induced MAPK activation. We conclude that DDR1 activated in this way may trigger pathways distinct from the EGF receptor. The tyrosine phosphorylation of DDR1b induced by the exposure to collagen can be blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein but is largely unaffected by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis (Fig.3 A). Furthermore, the disruption of focal adhesion complexes with cytochalasin D has no effect on the activation of DDR1b (Fig. 3 A). Keely et al. (14.Keely P.J. Fong A.M. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 595-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that T-47D cells express significant amounts of α2β1 integrin, which facilitates a comparison of signaling by DDR and integrin. To test whether DDR1 signaling is influenced by α2β1 integrin, we analyzed DDR1 phosphorylation in the presence of blocking antibodies to α2 or β1 integrin. First, we verified the effectiveness of the blocking antibodies on T-47D cell adhesion to collagen. We observed profound reduction of cell binding to collagen in the presence of either of the blocking antibodies (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the integrin block had no influence on the tyrosine phosphorylation of DDR1b (Fig. 3 C). Our previous results identified the Shc adapter protein as binding to the LSNPApY (where pY indicates phosphotyrosine) sequence in the alternatively spliced insert of DDR1b (7.Vogel W. Gish G. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 9.Alves F. Vogel W. Mossie K. Millauer B. Höfler H. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 609-618PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Shc from cells stimulated with collagen in the absence or presence of β1-blocking antibodies revealed that integrin activation did not influence the binding of Shc to DDR1b (Fig. 3 C). It has been shown that collagen immobilized on tissue culture dishes can elicit different integrin-dependent cellular responses compared with solubilized collagen. We therefore added T-47D cells to dishes coated with collagen type I in the presence of integrin-blocking antibodies. We observed that tyrosine phosphorylation of DDR1 took place regardless of the nature of collagen (solubilized or immobilized) and was not influenced by integrin-blocking antibodies (Fig. 3 D). To pursue this observation, we made use of the cell line GD25, which is derived from differentiated ES cells carrying a null mutation in both β1 integrin alleles (15.Fässler R. Pfaff M. Murphy J. Noegel A.N. Johannson S. Timpl R. Albrecht A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 16.Hirsch E. Iglesias A. Potocnik A.J. Hartmann U. Fässler R. Nature. 1996; 380: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 17.Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Because GD25 cells express only a small amount of DDR1, we generated a stably transfected cell line overexpressing DDR1b (GD25-DDR1b). We compared the response of GD25-DDR1b cells to collagen stimulation with NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts that were transfected with DDR1b in a similar way. As shown in Fig.4 A, DDR1b tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in both cell lines after collagen stimulation. Furthermore, a time course experiment with GD25-DDR1b cells stimulated with collagen for various times indicated that the previously reported delay in receptor activation is seen in these cells as well (Fig. 4 B). An immunohistochemical detection of DDR1b in GD25-DDR1b cells showed a uniform expression of DDR1b at the cell membrane that did not colocalize with the focal complexes identified by a double staining with antibodies against vinculin (Fig.4 C). Circumstantial evidence has suggested a function of DDRs in muscle formation (18.Vogel W. FASEB J. 1999; 13: S77-S82Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To address the role of DDR1 in myogenic signaling, we chose the mouse skeletal muscle C2C12 cell line that undergoes terminal differentiation into myotubes upon withdrawal of growth factor-rich medium. Because C2C12 cells express only low amounts of DDR1, we stably transfected DDR1b. Additionally, we introduced the dominant negative K529* mutant and verified expression by immunoblotting (Fig.5 A). Upon horse serum induction, parental and DDR1b overexpressing C2C12 cells readily fuse into myotubes forming multinucleated, elongated fibers (Fig.5 B). In contrast, C2C12 cells expressing truncated DDR1 failed to differentiate. Almost the entire population of two independently generated pools of transfected cells retained its flattened, mononucleated morphology. Interestingly, the addition of exogenous collagen did not modify the block in C2C12-K529* cell differentiation, raising the possibility that endogenously synthesized collagen is sufficient to trigger DDR1 activation (data not shown). By using two different approaches, our results demonstrate that DDR1 autophosphorylation and Shc binding can take place in the absence of any functional integrin collagen receptor. First, we utilized monoclonal antibodies to inhibit the binding of the α2β1 integrin receptor to collagen, and we demonstrated that DDR1 activation takes place in the presence of disabled integrins. Second, a cell line that is genetically ablated of β1 integrin expression shows characteristics and kinetics of DDR1 activation that are identical to wild-type cells. To provide additional evidence for the direct interaction of collagen with DDR, we used preparations of recombinant extracellular domain of DDR2 and recombinant triple-helical collagen. By generating additional synthetic collagen fragments, like the heparin-binding fragment HepV, we hope to characterize further the receptor-ligand binding epitopes. Following our initial observation that post-translational glycosylation of collagen is important for the activation of DDR, it has now been shown that in vitro glycated collagen type I is able to enhance DDR tyrosine phosphorylation (19.Norman J. Brought C. Romanov V. Goligorsky M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 638AGoogle Scholar). This observation implies a previously unknown interaction of DDR with hyperglycated collagen and potentially also with advanced glycation end products, thereby indicating a possible involvement of DDR1 in the formation of glomerulosclerosis in the diabetic kidney. Whereas the PDGF-R has recently been shown to colocalize with integrin receptors, the immunostaining presented here argues against a localization of DDR1 in the integrin-associated focal adhesion complex (20.Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that integrin and DDR signaling pathways might intercross further downstream. The interaction of Shc with DDR1b might overlap with the postulated function of Shc in cell cycle control downstream of certain integrin receptors, in particular of α1β1 integrin (21.Pozzi A. Wary K.K. Giancotti F.G. Gardner H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the induction of matrix metalloprotease 1 expression in response to collagen has not only been implicated to be mediated by DDR2 but also by the α1β2 integrin (7.Vogel W. Gish G. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar,22.Langholz O. Rockel D. Mauch C. Kozlowska E. Krieg T. Eckes B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131 (1015): 1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The complex nature of collagen will make it a challenge to map the binding epitope for the DDR extracellular domains. It will be of interest to determine whether DDR receptors have other physiological ligands that induce a more rapid activation of receptor tyrosine kinase activity and stimulation of the conventional MAPK pathway. However, it is possible that DDR receptors, like the Eph receptors, require the formation of oligomeric clusters to be activated fully and therefore respond with slow kinetics to events elicited by cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. The molecular processes leading to the fusion of myoblast cells to form multinucleated myofibers have been extensively studied. In particular, the synthesis of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins has shown to be essential for myogenic differentiation (23.Nandan E. Clarke E.P. Ball E.H. Sanwal B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1673-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here we provide the initial evidence that DDR1 may play an important role in the differentiation of cultured mouse skeletal muscle cells. A truncated mutant of DDR1 that inhibits DDR1 activation in a dominant negative fashion efficiently blocked myotube fusion. Earlier reports indicated a pivotal function of collagen in muscle formation. In particular, it has been shown that chicken and rat myoblasts fail to differentiate in the presence of drugs like ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate that inhibit the biosynthesis of collagen (24.Saitoh O. Periasamy M. Kan M. Matsuda R. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25.Menko A.S. Boettiger D. Cell. 1987; 51: 51-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Hence, we speculate that DDR1 may act as a sensor for the amount and integrity of the collagenous matrix surrounding myoblast cells. During cell differentiation, the DDR1 tyrosine kinase might trigger a signal leading to cell cycle arrest, which is necessary for the terminal differentiation into muscle cells. Further studies are underway to pinpoint the in vivo role of DDR1 during myogenesis. We thank V. Jassal for critical reading of the manuscript. We are grateful to A. Ullrich for providing cDNA plasmids."

The proton-driven motors of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimuriumhave been extensively studied, and the stator part of the torque generator consists of two cytoplasmic membrane proteins, MotA and MotB, which contain four transmembrane domains and one transmembrane domain, respectively (5.Dean G.E.

Ions passing through these proteins are thought to generate torque (16.Meister M. Lowe G. Berg H.C. Cell. 1987; 49: 643-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which is transmitted to the rotor part of the motor, the FliG protein (17.Lloyd S.A. Tang H. Wang X. Billings S.

Bacteria such as alkalophilic Bacillus and Vibriospecies use an electrochemical gradient of sodium to drive flagellar rotation (4.Imae Y. Atsumi T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The sodium-driven motor has advantages for the study of motor function because sodium-motive force can be easily manipulated. The specific sodium channel blockers, amiloride and phenamil, are powerful tools for studying the mechanism of energy conversion in this system (24.Sugiyama S. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Imae Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8215-8219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Atsumi T. Sugiyama S. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Imae Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1634-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four proteins essential for torque generation, PomA, PomB, MotX, and MotY, were recently identified in the polar flagellar motor of Vibrio alginolyticus (26.Asai Y. Kojima S. Kato H. Nishioka N. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5104-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27.Okunishi I. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PomA and PomB are homologous to MotA and MotB and contain four transmembrane segments and one transmembrane segment, respectively. MotX and MotY, first identified in Vibrio parahaemolyticus (28.McCarter L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4219-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.McCarter L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5988-5998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have a single putative transmembrane domain that is unique to the sodium-type motor. MotY has a peptidoglycan-binding motif at the carboxyl-terminal region that is also observed in MotB and PomB. Evidence suggests that MotX is part of the sodium channel component of the motor. Overexpression of MotX is lethal to E. coli in proportion to the external sodium ion concentration. Lethality is reversed in the presence of amiloride (29.McCarter L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5988-5998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the above four components are thought to form a sodium channel, no direct evidence has been demonstrated so far. In the present study, we report the isolation and reconstitution of the torque-generating unit of the Na+-driven polar flagellar motor component of V. alginolyticus as a stage in its biochemical characterization. The complex, purified via His-tagged PomA, includes both PomA and PomB and has an approximate molecular size of 175 kDa. In addition, reconstituted PomA/B proteoliposomes exhibit potassium diffusion potential-driven 22Na+uptake that is blocked by Li+ ions and phenamil. These results suggest that the heteromultimeric complex, consisting of PomA and PomB, acts as a sodium channel that generates the torque to drive flagellar rotation. V. alginolyticus strains NMB190 (Rifr, Pof+, Laf−,ΔpomA) (30.Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Sockett R.E. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6332-6338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and NMB191 (Rifr, Pof+, Laf−, ΔpomA, ΔpomB) (31.Yorimitsu T. Sato K. Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5103-5106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used and cultured at 30 °C in VC medium (0.5% (w/v) polypeptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.4% (w/v) K2HPO4, 3% (w/v) NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) glucose) or VPG medium (1% (w/v) polypeptone, 0.4% (w/v) K2HPO4, 3% (w/v) NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) glycerol). For the swarm assay, a VPG/0.3% agar plate was used. E. coli strain JM109 (recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi − , hsdR17, relA1, supE44, λ − , Δ(lac-proAB); F′, traD36, proAB, lacI q , ΔM15) was used for DNA manipulations and cultured at 37 °C in LB medium. When necessary, kanamycin was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml forVibrio cells or 25 μg/ml for E. coli cells. Plasmid pKS101, a pSU41-based plasmid, was constructed to carryhis6-pomA under the lacpromoter control. A 0.8-kilobase DNA fragment including thepomA open reading frame with a 5′ attachment of 5′-ATTGGATCCATGCATCACCATCACCATCACATGGATTTAGCAACCCTATTA-3′ (initiates as Met-His6; the underline indicates the created (BamHI and EcoT22I) restriction sites) was originally prepared by polymerase chain reaction and cloned intoBamHI-digested pSU41. Plasmid pKS105, encoding the tandem PomA, was generated by engineering an EcoT22I site at the 3′ end of the pomA clone, and then linked to the 5′ end ofhis6-pomA via EcoT22I. The final linking sequence was Met-His6 (one methionine and six histidines), which was added at the junction. All the total inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells of NMB190 harboring pKS101 were cultured at 30 °C under strong aeration in VPG medium. Cells were harvested and washed with buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgSO4, 10% (w/v) sucrose) and stored at −80 °C until use. The frozen cells were thawed, resuspended (0.2 g/ml, wet weight) in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgSO4, 30 μg/ml DNase I, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Membrane vesicles were prepared by subjecting the suspension to a single passage through a French press (5501-M Ohtake Works) at 4000 p.s.i. at 4 °C. Undisrupted cells were removed by low speed centrifugation (10,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C), and the membrane fraction was recovered from the supernatant by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 2 h. The membrane pellet was suspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% (w/v) glycerol) containing 5 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and 2.5% (w/v) β-octyl- glucoside. The suspension was stirred for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g. The clarified extract was mixed with Ni-NTA1-agarose (Qiagen) prewashed with the same buffer, incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle mixing, and then packed into the column. The loaded resin was washed with Buffer A containing 40 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and 1.25% (w/v) β-octylglucoside. Elution was conducted with Buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and 1.25% (w/v) β-octylglucoside. The Ni-NTA-purified material was diluted 5-fold with Buffer B (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 1.25% (w/v)β-octylglucoside) and applied to a MiniQ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was washed with Buffer B, and bound material was eluted with a 0–800 mm linear gradient of KCl in Buffer B. Fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PomB antibody. Peak fractions were combined and concentrated by a MiniQ column. PomA/B complex was eluted from the column at a salt concentration of ∼220 mm. The concentrated solution was applied on a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer B containing 100 mm KCl. The peak fractions containing both His6-PomA and PomB were pooled and stored at −80 °C. Purification of His6-PomA alone from NMB191 (ΔpomAB) strain harboring pKS101 was performed essentially as described above. Protein concentrations were assayed by the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Proteoliposomes were reconstituted by the octylglucoside dilution method. A sample of purified PomA/B complex (8.0 μg) or His6-PomA (4.7 μg) was mixed with 5.0 mg of E. coli phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids) in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 1.25% (w/v) β-octylglucoside, 10% (w/v) glycerol. The mixture (100 μl) was sonicated briefly, incubated on ice for 20 min, and rapidly diluted (40-fold) into the dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl). After 15 min at room temperature with gentle shaking, the proteoliposomes formed were recovered by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h, resuspended in 100 μl of dilution buffer, frozen in dry ice/ethanol, and stored at −80 °C. When assayed, the suspension was thawed at room temperature. Inverted membrane vesicles were prepared as described above. Preparation of spheroplasts of V. alginolyticus was performed as described previously (44.Osborn M.J. Munson R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Membranes (60 μl) were treated with 15 μl of Proteinase K at the indicated concentrations on ice for 30 min. The samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-PomB antibody (31.Yorimitsu T. Sato K. Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5103-5106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The standard incubation mixture contained 500 μl of the following at 30 °C: 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mm choline chloride, 0.5 mm22NaCl (4 μCi/ml), and proteoliposomes loaded with 200 mm KCl (50 μl). The mixture was allowed to equilibrate for 5 min. Inhibitors were added, and after a 1-min incubation, a membrane potential was applied by adding 20 μmvalinomycin. At intervals, 90 μl of the reaction mixture was filtered through a nitrocellulose filter (0.2-μm pore size, Toyo Roshi Co. Ltd.) with suction and washed three times with 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 200 mmcholine chloride. The radioactivity trapped on the filter was determined by a γ-counter. We isolated the torque-generating unit of the polar flagellar motor from V. alginolyticusbased on the features characterized for PomA protein; at least it forms a functional complex with PomB protein in the cytoplasmic membrane (31.Yorimitsu T. Sato K. Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5103-5106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed a plasmid, pKS101, that encodes PomA with an attached hexahistidine sequence on the amino terminus of the protein, His6-PomA. The plasmid, pKS101, complemented apomA null mutant; these results were similar to those observed with pYA301, which encodes wild-type PomA. In addition, the swimming speed of the cells harboring pKS101 was similar to that of wild-type cells (data not shown). Thus, the attachment of the hexahistidine tag does not interfere with PomA function. Membrane fractions of NMB190 transformed with pKS101 were prepared, solubilized with β-octylglucoside (Fig.1, lane 1), and passed through a Ni-NTA-agarose column. The agarose column was washed, and bound protein was eluted with the buffer containing imidazole (Fig. 1,lane 2). The eluate from the Ni-NTA-agarose resin was applied to a MiniQ anion exchange column and eluted with a salt gradient. The eluate was analyzed by immunoblots using antibodies generated against PomA and PomB, and fractions that contained both PomA and PomB were collected (Fig. 1, lane 3). Finally, using a Superose 6 column, most other proteins were quantitatively removed, and PomA was eluted together with PomB but not with either MotX or MotY (Fig. 1, lane 4). Although His6-PomA is overexpressed in the cells, the protein complex purified above contains only endogenous PomB. Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining intensities of PomA and PomB bands of the complex separated by SDS-PAGE were measured by densitometry. The ratio of bound dye was 1.0:0.55 (PomA:PomB), and taking the molecular size of each protein into account, a calculated ratio of PomA and PomB in the complex was found to be 2.3:1.0 (PomA:PomB). Thus, it seems that the apparent molar ratio of PomA/B in the purified complex is 2 PomA:1 PomB, although the exact estimation necessitates more detailed investigation. Proteoliposomes were prepared from purified PomA/B and E. coli phospholipids by the detergent dilution method (32.Racker E. Violand B. O'Neal S. Alfonzo M. Telford J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 198: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 33.Sato K. Wickner W. Science. 1998; 281: 700-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To assess whether the PomA/B complex was properly reconstituted in the liposomes, we compared its topological orientation in liposomes to that of PomA/B in spheroplasts (Fig.2). Treatment of spheroplasts with Proteinase K cleaved the carboxyl-terminal epitope of PomB. The same cleavage occurred after purified PomA/B complex inserted into liposomes was treated with Proteinase K. The carboxyl-terminal epitope of PomB in inverted membrane vesicles was protected from Proteinase K digestion by the membranes. However, lysis by Triton X-100 of spheroplasts, inverted membrane vesicles, or proteoliposomes resulted in carboxyl-terminal digestion by Proteinase K. A quantitative assessment of the PomB digestion in spheroplasts and proteoliposomes indicates that at least 80–90% of the purified PomA/B was inserted into liposomes with the correct orientation (right side out). We conclude that the purified PomA/B complexes that were incorporated into liposomes were asymmetrically inserted with the same relative orientation as in the cytoplasmic membrane. The kinetics of 22Na+uptake into reconstituted proteoliposomes are shown in Fig.3. When valinomycin was added to potassium-loaded PomA/B liposomes, creating Δψ in response to the potassium gradient, 22Na+ was rapidly translocated to the inside of proteoliposomes. No significant22Na+ uptake was observed in control liposomes without PomA/B (data not shown) or PomB, indicating that the PomA/B complex but not valinomycin is responsible for22Na+ translocation. If the driving force for sodium uptake consisted of only ΔpNa+, the rate of22Na+ uptake was very low. These results are indicative of an electrogenic Na+ transport by purified PomA/B complex. The accumulation of 22Na+ ions was effectively prevented by the presence of 50 μmphenamil, which is a specific inhibitor of the sodium-driven flagellar motor (25.Atsumi T. Sugiyama S. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Imae Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1634-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Kojima S. Asai Y. Atsumi T. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The sodium-driven motor of V. alginolyticus has been shown to function using lithium ion (35.Liu J.Z. Dapice M. Khan S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 55236-55244Google Scholar). Sodium translocation into PomA/B proteoliposomes was effectively inhibited by Li+, indicating that Na+ and Li+ compete at a common binding site on the protein. These results are the first clear evidence of a bacterial flagellar motor component that acts directly as a primary ion channel. To determine the apparent molecular size of the PomA/B complex, we performed gel permeation chromatography by loading purified PomA/B complex along with several molecular mass standards onto a Superose 6 column. The PomA/B complex was eluted between catalase (240 kDa) and aldolase (158 kDa) (Fig. 4). Considering the micellar size of β-octylglucoside (2.1 kDa), the apparent molecular size of the PomA/B complex was estimated to be 175 kDa. We further purified His6-PomA alone from a pomABnull mutant strain (NMB191) harboring pKS101. When purified His6-PomA was applied to the Superose 6 column as described above, His6-PomA was eluted faster than would be expected for the PomA monomer (Fig. 4), which has a molecular size of 27 kDa. The estimated molecular size was 55 kDa. This result suggests that PomA alone exists as a stable homodimer in detergent extract. To further elucidate the dimeric structure of PomA, we constructed a plasmid encoding tandems of two PomA subunits expressed as a single polypeptide (Fig. 5 A). Previous studies suggested that PomA has four membrane spans and that the amino and carboxyl termini must be on the same side of the membrane (26.Asai Y. Kojima S. Kato H. Nishioka N. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5104-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Hence a tandem complex of two covalently linked PomA subunits might be expected to assemble into a functional state. The construction was performed by linking two pomA open reading frames in frame with six histidines as a linker. As shown in Fig. 5 C, NMB190 (ΔpomA) cells expressing the tandem PomA did indeed show ability to swarm in a soft agar plate. Compared with wild-type PomA, NMB190 cells expressing tandem PomA demonstrated a reduction in swarming ability. Since the carboxyl terminus of SalmonellaMotA has been shown to be important for its activity (36.Muramoto K. Macnab R.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1191-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), diminished swarm ability may be due to restricted flexibility around the carboxyl terminus of the amino-terminal half of tandem PomA. To demonstrate that the swarm activity observed is due to the activity of full-length tandem PomA and not to monomeric PomA, either from partial translation or proteolytic degradation of PomA fusion, immunoblots were prepared using membrane preparations from NMB190 expressing the tandem fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 5 B, tandem PomA migrates at around 50 kDa. It should be noted that no other immunoreactive species is observed on the immunoblots, particularly around 25 kDa, where the monomeric His6-PomA migrates. The functional tandem fusion PomA was purified by Ni-NTA resin from the NMB191 (ΔpomAB) strain that expresses tandem PomA by Ni-NTA resin. The molecular size was analyzed by a Superose 6 column together with Ni-NTA-purified monomeric His6-PomA, and the fractions were examined by immunoblotting with anti-PomA antibody. The purified His6-PomA was eluted in exactly the same fractions as tandem PomA (Fig. 6). These results strongly support the stable homodimerization of native PomA.Figure 6Size exclusion chromatography of His 6 -PomA (PomA) and tandem PomA (PomA-PomA) on a Superose 6 column.His6-PomA and tandem PomA were briefly purified by a Ni-NTA column and then applied to a Superose 6 column. The anti-PomA immunoblot profile of each fraction is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have reconstituted the flagellar motor component of V. alginolyticus into proteoliposomes from pure phospholipids and purified membrane protein. Our results indicate that the purified PomA/B complex forms a sodium-conducting channel, whereas purified PomA alone does not. Although we have not examined the ability of PomB alone to mediate 22Na+ translocation, PomB has been shown to be degraded in the absence of PomA, and the simultaneous expression of both PomA and PomB is required for the stability of PomB (31.Yorimitsu T. Sato K. Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5103-5106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MotX and MotY, which are also essential components required for torque generation in vivo, are apparently not part of the complex. Our data, however, do not exclude the possibility of a further stimulatory effect on sodium transport by MotX and MotY, or MotX and MotY might form a sodium channel independent of the PomA/B complex that may even be essential for torque generation. The isolation of the MotX and MotY proteins is now in progress and should help to clarify the function of those components. Can we exclude the possibility that minor contaminants contribute to or even cause the activities ascribed to the PomA/B complex? On the basis of sodium uptake activity per unit amount of PomA/B complex, proteoliposomes reconstituted from the PomA/B complex, which was purified from the strains overexpressing both His6-PomA and PomB, were as active as those reconstituted from the His6-PomA-overproducing strain (data not shown), suggesting that PomA and PomB were enough to catalyze sodium uptake. Even though the functional partnership of PomA and PomB proteins, as well as E. coli MotA and MotB, has been established, information concerning their interactions and molecular stoichiometry is very limited. Indeed, their physical interaction has been demonstrated so far only by a co-sedimentation analysis (31.Yorimitsu T. Sato K. Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5103-5106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Tang H. Braun T.F. Blair D.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). An important finding in this study is that the Na+-driven flagellar motor components of V. alginolyticus, PomA and PomB, are purified as a functional complex. The subunit ratio of purified complex was estimated to be 2 PomA:1 PomB, which is about 89 kDa in size. Considering that the apparent molecular size of the PomA/B complex was 175 kDa, the native functional complex might consist of four copies of PomA and two copies of PomB as a single torque-generating unit, although more detailed investigation is required. When the purified His6-PomA alone was applied to a Superose 6 column, His6-PomA was eluted as a stable homodimer, suggesting that an even number of PomA subunits is recruited per functional complex. Consistent with the presence of homodimeric PomA, when the purified PomA/B complex was analyzed by a Superose 6 column, the elution profile showed two peaks corresponding to the PomA/B complex and to dimeric PomA, which may be dissociated from the complex. PomA/B reconstituted into liposomes facilitates Na+ uptake in a phenamil-sensitive manner. This finding is consistent with our previous observation that phenamil interacts directly with PomA/B (34.Kojima S. Asai Y. Atsumi T. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and with the closely related bacterium V. parahaemolyticus(38.Jaques S. Kim Y.K. McCarter L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5740-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The present study also shows that Na+ uptake was abolished with the presence of Li+ ions. This result is in good agreement with previous results suggesting that lithium can substitute for sodium (35.Liu J.Z. Dapice M. Khan S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 55236-55244Google Scholar). These observations further underscore the complexity of PomA/B pore selectivity. Interestingly,22Na+ uptake appears to be directed by the membrane potential but not by the concentration gradient. This result suggests that the transport of Na+ ions through the PomA/B complex is an electrogenic event. At present, however, the importance of this channel property in regard to torque generation remains unclear. The mechanism linking the translocation of Δψ-driven Na+ ions across the motor component to the generation of rotary torque for flagellar rotation may be similar to the proposed voltage-generated torque generation of the Na+-translocating F1F0-ATPase ofPropionigenium modestum (39.Kaim G. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5887-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Complex membrane events, such as solute transport (40.Kaback H.R. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1998; 281: 700-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), have been functionally reconstituted into proteoliposomes, thus allowing the direct investigation of fundamental cell biological mechanisms. This study demonstrates the availability of a pure, functional flagellar motor component, which can be reconstituted into proteoliposomes able to catalyze ion transport, as an avenue toward the enzymological resolution of torque generation.

To avoid breakdown of the epithelial barrier, this process requires coordinated opening and closing of tight junctions, the most apical intercellular junctions in epithelia.

We found that expression of mutants with a modified N-terminal cytoplasmic domain up-regulated migration, whereas deletion of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain did not have an effect.

To emigrate from the blood, neutrophils need to become stimulated by chemotactic factors to adhere and cross the endothelium and to migrate across the inflamed epithelium (1.Dunon D. Piali L. Imhof B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 2.Parkos C.A. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3.Huber D. Balda M.S. Matter K. Inv. Metastasis. 1999; 18: 70-80Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Neutrophils cross simple epithelia by migrating along the normally closed paracellular pathway, requiring a highly coordinated opening and closing of the epithelial intercellular junctions. Breakdown of the epithelial barrier caused by acute inflammations often results in organ failure.The epithelial junctional complex consists of different types of cell-cell interactions, among which tight junctions (TJ)1 are the most apical structures (4.Cereijido M. Cereijido M. Tight Junctions. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-13Google Scholar, 5.Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). TJ function as semipermeable diffusion barriers that regulate selective diffusion along the paracellular pathway and act as intramembrane fences that prevent the intermixing of apical and basolateral membrane components in the exoplasmic membrane leaflet (6.Balda M.S. Matter K. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,7.Madara J.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). TJ consist of several transmembrane proteins and a cytoplasmic plaque composed of different proteins that generally function as cytoskeletal linkers and/or signal transducers (8.Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 9.Stevenson B.R. Keon B.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).Although an elegant in vitro system to analyze transepithelial migration of neutrophils has been known for a long time (11.Cramer E.B. Milks L.C. Ojakian G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4069-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), little is known about how tight junction properties affect this process. It is thought, however, that the permeability of TJ influences the efficiency of migration by regulating diffusion of the chemoattractant (12.Milks L. Brontoli M. Cramer E. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Of all the known tight junction proteins, only the junctional adhesion molecule has been shown to modulate transmigration of neutrophils across endothelia (13.Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Willians L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). It is not known, however, whether the junctional adhesion molecule is also important for migration across epithelia.We started to analyze the function of epithelial tight junction proteins in the transmigration of neutrophils using the previously established in vitro system in which MDCK cells are cultured on a permeable support, and migration is then measured by adding neutrophils to one and chemoattractant to the other side (11.Cramer E.B. Milks L.C. Ojakian G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4069-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We combined this experimental system with stably transfected MDCK cells expressing wild-type or mutant occludin, the best characterized transmembrane protein of tight junctions. Occludin possesses four transmembrane domains and two external loops (Fig. 1); the N- and the C-terminal domains are exposed to the cytosol (14.Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2095) Google Scholar). Although occludin is not required for the formation of morphologically normal tight junctions (15.Saitou M. Fujimoto K. Doi Y. Itoh M. Fujimoto T. Furuse M. Takano H. Noda T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), it is involved in the regulation of selective paracellular permeability and in the fence function of TJ (reviewed in Ref. 16.Matter K. Balda M.S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 186: 117-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that occludin is indeed important for the regulation of neutrophil migration. Our results indicate that occludin modulates transepithelial migration of neutrophils, but the effects on transmigration do not correlate with the changes in paracellular permeability and transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Moreover, our results demonstrate for the first time a functional role of the N-terminal cytosolic domain of occludin.DISCUSSIONOur experiments indicate that occludin is a regulator of the transmigration of neutrophils across epithelial sheets. The N-terminal cytosolic domain of occludin, which is not critical for TER and selective paracellular permeability, is important for this function. Thus, not only the C-terminal but also the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of occludin is of functional relevance.Modification of the N-terminal cytosolic domain of transfected occludin results in two phenotypes: an increased efficiency of transmigration and, if the C-terminal domain is also inactivated, a discontinuous distribution of transfected and endogenous occludin. The finding that the N-terminal cytosolic domain is sufficient to mediate a continuous distribution of occludin suggests that this domain also interacts with the submembrane cytoskeleton, similar to the C-terminal domain. Although several components of the submembrane plaque of tight junctions are known, the protein that binds to the N-terminal domain of occludin has not yet been identified.The C-terminal cytosolic domain of occludin interacts with at least four proteins: the three peripheral membrane proteins ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 (23.Furuse M.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the ZO-1 complex also interacts with the actin-cytoskeleton, this protein may in fact serve as an anchor and therefore be important for the continuous distribution of occludin (24.Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 30.Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Moroi S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Although occludin is continuously distributed in junctions lacking detectable ZO-1 (31.Ohsugi M. Larue L. Schwarz H. Kemler R. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), this might be due to the presence of additional interactions mediated by the N-terminal domain, as we show here in cells expressing occludinCT3.Interestingly, expression of mutants lacking the C-terminal cytosolic domain did not affect transmigration, suggesting either that this domain and its interactions with the submembrane cytoskeleton are not required for transmigration or, alternatively, that the connections provided by endogenous occludin are sufficient. Because removal of the C-terminal domain results in increased paracellular permeability, this finding also suggests that the amount of chemoattractant that crosses wild-type MDCK cells is sufficient to provide maximal stimulation. In contrast, reduction of paracellular flux by expression of OccL1D (a mutant that inhibits paracellular flux by more than 50%) (34.Balda, M. S., Flores, C., Cereijido, M., and Matter, K. (1999) J. Cell. Biochem., in pressGoogle Scholar) significantly reduced the number of transmigrating neutrophils. Nevertheless, it cannot yet be excluded that this inhibition is due to a function of this extracellular loop during the transmigration process.Occludin is important for all functions of tight junctions tested thus far: the formation of a semipermeable paracellular diffusion barrier (17.Balda M.S.

Nevertheless, different structural domains of occludin are important for different functions. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain modulates paracellular diffusion but does not appear to play a role in neutrophil transmigration. In contrast, the N-terminal cytosolic domain regulates transmigration but not paracellular permeability. On the other hand, modification of both cytoplasmic domains is required for a discontinuous distribution of occludin and disruption of the intramembrane diffusion barrier because only expression of HAoccludinCT3 (17.Balda M.S.

Matter, unpublished data. results in a breakdown of the intramembrane diffusion barrier.To summarize, this study identifies occludin as a regulator of neutrophil transmigration across epithelia. Specific domains and properties of occludin are involved in the regulation of transmigration. Although the precise role of occludin in the mechanism that allows the reversible opening of tight junctions is not clear, the effects of transfected wild-type and mutant occludin on transmigration do not correlate with their effects on TER and paracellular permeability. Our results also indicate for the first time that the N-terminal cytosolic domain of occludin is of functional relevance. Mucosal infections result in the accumulation of large amounts of leukocytes at sites of inflammation, with neutrophils being the first phagocytic cell type that arrives. To emigrate from the blood, neutrophils need to become stimulated by chemotactic factors to adhere and cross the endothelium and to migrate across the inflamed epithelium (1.Dunon D. Piali L. Imhof B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 2.Parkos C.A. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3.Huber D. Balda M.S. Matter K. Inv. Metastasis. 1999; 18: 70-80Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Neutrophils cross simple epithelia by migrating along the normally closed paracellular pathway, requiring a highly coordinated opening and closing of the epithelial intercellular junctions. Breakdown of the epithelial barrier caused by acute inflammations often results in organ failure. The epithelial junctional complex consists of different types of cell-cell interactions, among which tight junctions (TJ)1 are the most apical structures (4.Cereijido M. Cereijido M. Tight Junctions. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-13Google Scholar, 5.Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). TJ function as semipermeable diffusion barriers that regulate selective diffusion along the paracellular pathway and act as intramembrane fences that prevent the intermixing of apical and basolateral membrane components in the exoplasmic membrane leaflet (6.Balda M.S. Matter K. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,7.Madara J.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). TJ consist of several transmembrane proteins and a cytoplasmic plaque composed of different proteins that generally function as cytoskeletal linkers and/or signal transducers (8.Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 9.Stevenson B.R. Keon B.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 89-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 10.Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Although an elegant in vitro system to analyze transepithelial migration of neutrophils has been known for a long time (11.Cramer E.B. Milks L.C. Ojakian G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4069-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), little is known about how tight junction properties affect this process. It is thought, however, that the permeability of TJ influences the efficiency of migration by regulating diffusion of the chemoattractant (12.Milks L. Brontoli M. Cramer E. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Of all the known tight junction proteins, only the junctional adhesion molecule has been shown to modulate transmigration of neutrophils across endothelia (13.Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Willians L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). It is not known, however, whether the junctional adhesion molecule is also important for migration across epithelia. We started to analyze the function of epithelial tight junction proteins in the transmigration of neutrophils using the previously established in vitro system in which MDCK cells are cultured on a permeable support, and migration is then measured by adding neutrophils to one and chemoattractant to the other side (11.Cramer E.B. Milks L.C. Ojakian G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4069-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We combined this experimental system with stably transfected MDCK cells expressing wild-type or mutant occludin, the best characterized transmembrane protein of tight junctions. Occludin possesses four transmembrane domains and two external loops (Fig. 1); the N- and the C-terminal domains are exposed to the cytosol (14.Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2095) Google Scholar). Although occludin is not required for the formation of morphologically normal tight junctions (15.Saitou M. Fujimoto K. Doi Y. Itoh M. Fujimoto T. Furuse M. Takano H. Noda T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), it is involved in the regulation of selective paracellular permeability and in the fence function of TJ (reviewed in Ref. 16.Matter K. Balda M.S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 186: 117-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that occludin is indeed important for the regulation of neutrophil migration. Our results indicate that occludin modulates transepithelial migration of neutrophils, but the effects on transmigration do not correlate with the changes in paracellular permeability and transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Moreover, our results demonstrate for the first time a functional role of the N-terminal cytosolic domain of occludin. DISCUSSIONOur experiments indicate that occludin is a regulator of the transmigration of neutrophils across epithelial sheets. The N-terminal cytosolic domain of occludin, which is not critical for TER and selective paracellular permeability, is important for this function. Thus, not only the C-terminal but also the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of occludin is of functional relevance.Modification of the N-terminal cytosolic domain of transfected occludin results in two phenotypes: an increased efficiency of transmigration and, if the C-terminal domain is also inactivated, a discontinuous distribution of transfected and endogenous occludin. The finding that the N-terminal cytosolic domain is sufficient to mediate a continuous distribution of occludin suggests that this domain also interacts with the submembrane cytoskeleton, similar to the C-terminal domain. Although several components of the submembrane plaque of tight junctions are known, the protein that binds to the N-terminal domain of occludin has not yet been identified.The C-terminal cytosolic domain of occludin interacts with at least four proteins: the three peripheral membrane proteins ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 (23.Furuse M.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the ZO-1 complex also interacts with the actin-cytoskeleton, this protein may in fact serve as an anchor and therefore be important for the continuous distribution of occludin (24.Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 30.Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Moroi S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Although occludin is continuously distributed in junctions lacking detectable ZO-1 (31.Ohsugi M. Larue L. Schwarz H. Kemler R. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), this might be due to the presence of additional interactions mediated by the N-terminal domain, as we show here in cells expressing occludinCT3.Interestingly, expression of mutants lacking the C-terminal cytosolic domain did not affect transmigration, suggesting either that this domain and its interactions with the submembrane cytoskeleton are not required for transmigration or, alternatively, that the connections provided by endogenous occludin are sufficient. Because removal of the C-terminal domain results in increased paracellular permeability, this finding also suggests that the amount of chemoattractant that crosses wild-type MDCK cells is sufficient to provide maximal stimulation. In contrast, reduction of paracellular flux by expression of OccL1D (a mutant that inhibits paracellular flux by more than 50%) (34.Balda, M. S., Flores, C., Cereijido, M., and Matter, K. (1999) J. Cell. Biochem., in pressGoogle Scholar) significantly reduced the number of transmigrating neutrophils. Nevertheless, it cannot yet be excluded that this inhibition is due to a function of this extracellular loop during the transmigration process.Occludin is important for all functions of tight junctions tested thus far: the formation of a semipermeable paracellular diffusion barrier (17.Balda M.S.

Proliferation inhibition experiments with kinase inhibitors such as herbimycin A, K-252a, and PD98059 revealed that the enhanced proliferation was actually due to the activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway. A TrkA dimer was detected in the GD3 synthase transfectant cells regardless of NGF treatment by cross-linking and immunoblotting. The increased expression of GD1b and GT1b in these transfectant cells might induce the conformational change of TrkA to form a dimer and to be activated continuously.

Ganglioside nomenclature is based on that of Svennerholm (45.Svennerholm L. J. Neurochem. 1963; 10: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) Gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, are thought to play important roles in the development and function of the nervous system, since they are enriched in brain tissues of vertebrates and their profiles of carbohydrate moiety alter along with development (1.Suzuki K. J. Neurochem. 1965; 12: 969-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 2.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). A number of glycosyltransferase genes have been isolated (3.Lloyd K.O. Furukawa K. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and studies of those genes have shown that various expression patterns of gangliosides are determined basically by the combination of activated glycosyltransferase genes. GD3 is a disialylhematoside expressed mainly in the retina and fetal brain (4.Yu R.K. Macala L.J. Taki T. Weinfeld H.M. Yu F.S. J.

These results suggest that GD3 is involved mainly in the neuronal proliferation and the subsequent processes of differentiation such as neurite extension and synapse formation (10.Ledeen R.W. Wu G.

Oettgen H.F. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). During this clinical study, human T cells were observed to express GD3, when activated by various mitogens and cytokines (17.Hersey P. Schibeci S.D. Townsend P. Burns C. Cheresh D.A. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 6083-6090PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Welte K. Miller G. Chapman P.B. Yuasa H. Natoli E. Kunicka J.E. Cordon-Cardo C. Buhrer C. Old L.J. Hougton A.N. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1763-1771PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-GD3 mAb1 R24 itself also induced T cell activation. These findings suggest that GD3 is involved in the activation of T lymphocytes and might emit cellular signals inducing T cell proliferation. In addition, GD3 expression was observed in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (19.Siddiqui B. Buehler J. DeGregorio M.W. Macher B.A. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5262-5265PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Merritt W.D. Casper J.T. Lauer S.J. Reaman G.H. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 1724-1730PubMed Google Scholar) and adult T cell leukemia cells (21.Okada M. Furukawa K. Yamashiro S. Yamada Y. Haraguchi M. Horibe K. Kato K. Tsuji Y. Furukawa K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2844-2848PubMed Google Scholar). These T cell leukemias are extraordinarily aggressive and resistant to current therapy, indicating that GD3 might play essential roles in their malignant features. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells are widely used as a differentiation model of neuronal cells, since they show neurite extension after nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation. The ganglioside GM1 enhanced the effect of NGF on the induction of differentiation (22.Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Miyadai T. Hamaguchi M. Fujiki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5087-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). GM1 also can prevent the death of PC12 cells caused by serum deprivation (23.Ferrari G. Anderson B.L. Stephens R.M. Kaplan D.R. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3074-3080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Mutohet al. (22.Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Miyadai T. Hamaguchi M. Fujiki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5087-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) demonstrated that GM1 bound to TrkA and enhanced its kinase activity, suggesting that gangliosides interact with growth (or differentiation) factor receptors and modulate their functions. Kasahara et al. (24.Kasahara K. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto T. Sanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29947-29953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) also reported that GD3 associates with Lyn kinase physically and functionally on the surface of primary cerebellar neurons. In the present study, we have tried to modulate the ganglioside composition of PC12 cells by introducing glycosyltransferase genes to analyze the regulatory functions of gangliosides in the cellular signaling for proliferation and/or differentiation. To our surprise, PC12 cells transfected with GD3 synthase cDNA showed a marked increase of cell growth and an inability to respond to NGF stimulation. We have studied the molecular mechanisms underlying the continuous proliferation of the GD3 synthase gene transfectant cells. The novel findings in PC12 transfectant cells may indicate universal roles of gangliosides in the regulation of cell growth/differentiation, in the tissue development, and the malignant transformation of cells. The rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For the neurite outgrowth assay, PC12 cells were seeded in the above growth medium at 1 × 105 cells/well in type I collagen-coated 48-well culture plates (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) and allowed to grow for 24 h. Cells were either treated with 100 ng/ml 2.5S NGF (Alamone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) in serum-free medium or were left untreated in the above medium. Neurite-bearing cells were counted on the 1st to the 4th day of culture. Human α2,8-sialyltransferase cDNA clone pD3T-31 (7.Haraguchi M. Yamashiro S. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Lloyd K.O.

A. 1994; 91: 10455-10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) was digested by XhoI and inserted into the XhoI site of pMIKneo to obtain the pMIKneo/D3T-31. pMIKneo is a mammalian expression vector with SRα promoter and was generously provided by Dr. K. Maruyama (Tokyo Medical and Dental University). PC12 cells used for cDNA transfection were plated in a 60-mm plastic tissue culture plate (Falcon) at a density of 7 × 105 cells/4 ml/plate. After 48 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The pMIKneo/D3T-31 vector (4 μg) was mixed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then added to PC12 cells in the plates. After a 6-h incubation, the medium was changed to the regular one as described above. Stable transfectants were selected with 250 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). One × 105 cells/ml/well were plated in collagen-coated 48-well plates on day 1 of culture. Cell numbers were counted by the trypan blue dye exclusion method up to day 5. For the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation assay, cells were incubated at the cell density described above for 16 h prior to the addition of 100 μm BrdUrd (Sigma). After an additional 6-h incubation, the cells were fixed with cold methanol for 10 min, rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated for 30 min in 1.5m HCl in order to denature the DNA. After being washed three times in PBS, the plates were incubated with a 1:50 dilution of a fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the cells were washed in PBS three times and incubated with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The cell surface expression of gangliosides was analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA), using the anti-ganglioside monoclonal antibodies (mAb) M2590 (anti-GM3), mAb 10–11 (anti-GM2, kindly provided by Dr. P. O. Livingston of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center), mAb CDR73–6 (anti-fucosyl-GM1, generously provided by Dr. S. Kusunoki, Tokyo University), mAb 92–22 (anti-GD1a), mAb R24 (anti-GD3, kindly provided by Dr. L. J. Old of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center), mAb 3F8 (anti-GD2, generously provided by Dr. N. K. Cheung of the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center), mAb 370 (anti-GD1b), mAb 549 (anti-GT1b), and mAb GMR-13 (anti-GQ1b, kindly provided by Dr. Tai of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Medical Research). Unless described otherwise, the antibodies were generated in our laboratory (25.Miyazaki H. Fukumoto S. Okada M. Hasegawa T. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24794-24799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with mAbs for 45 min on ice and then stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM or IgG (Cappel, Durham, NC). To analyze GM1, cells were incubated with biotin-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) for 45 min on ice and then stained with FITC-conjugated avidin (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA). Control cells for flow cytometry were prepared by using the second antibody alone. The enzyme activity of α2,8-sialyltransferase was measured as described previously (26.Thampoe I.J. Furukawa K. Vellve E. Lloyd K.O. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6258-6264PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, to prepare membrane fractions, samples were lysed using a nitrogen cavitation apparatus. For the analysis of the enzyme activity of α2,8-sialyltransferase, the reaction mixture contained the following in a volume of 50 μl: 100 mm sodium cacodylate HCl, pH 6.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3% Triton CF-54 (Sigma), 325 μm GM3, 400 mm CMP-NeuAc (Sigma), CMP-[14C]NeuAc (2.5 × 105 dpm) (NEN Life Science Products), and the membrane fractions containing 50 μg of protein. The products were isolated by a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and fluorography as described (27.Yamashiro S. Haraguchi M. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Nagata Y. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6149-6155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Serum-deprived PC12 cells in 48-well plates were treated with various inhibitors in the conditions as described below. Cells were treated with 50 μm PD98059 (a MEK inhibitor, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 30 min, 0.5 μm K-252a (a Trk tyrosine kinase inhibitor, kindly provided by Kyowa Medex Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min, or 0.5 μg/ml herbimycin A (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, a generous gift from Dr. Uehara, Japanese National Institute of Health) for 1 h prior to the addition of serum-containing medium. Cells were treated with 1 μm wortmannin (a PI3 kinase inhibitor, Sigma) for 30 min prior to the addition of serum-containing medium, and then it was added every 12 h for 5 days. PC12 cells and transfectants were plated in 60-mm tissue culture plates in serum-containing medium. Before NGF treatment, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and the cells were incubated for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with 100 ng/ml 2.5 S NGF for the appropriate times in the individual experiments at 37 °C. After this treatment, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with 3 ml of serum-free medium and then solubilized in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 units/ml aprotinin). Lysed cells were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, and then lysates were subjected to 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and immunoblotted with antibodies reactive with either neurofilament-M (Affinity Products), GD3 synthase (kindly presented by Dr. Y. Sanai at Tokyo Research Institute of Clinical Medicine), and MAPK (or ERK1/2) or phospho-MAPK (New England Biolabs). Cells were treated with NGF (100 ng/ml) for appropriate times indicated at 37 °C and then washed with cold PBS containing 1 mmNa3VO4 and lysed with lysis buffer described above. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-TrkA antibody C-14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The precipitates were washed in lysis buffer 3 times, then were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-TrkA antibody (New England Biolabs) or anti-TrkA antibody (C-14). The individual bands were detected by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (New England Biolabs) combined with the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were plated in 100-mm culture plates (Falcon) at a density of 5 × 106 cells/plate and cultured in serum-containing medium for 48 h. Before NGF treatment, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and the cells were incubated for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with 100 ng/ml 2.5 S NGF for 60 min at 4 °C. After treatment, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with 3 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 1 mmNa3VO4 (Sigma). The chemical cross-linker BS3 (Pierce) was added up to 2 mm in cross-linker buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 6 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA). Cross-linked cells were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mmNaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell-free lysates were adjusted to the same protein concentration and immunoprecipitated with an anti-Trk antibody C-14 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The precipitate was subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted, and then analyzed as described above. A monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 was used for the detection of phosphorylated tyrosine residues according to manufacturer's protocol. The bands were detected by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). After the transfection of PC12 cells with GD3 synthase expression vector pMIKneo/D3T-31 or pMIKneo alone, PC12/D3T-1 and -2 and vector control lines PC12V-1 and -2 cells were established. The increased levels of GD3 synthase activity (Fig.1 A) and its expression (Fig.1 B) were confirmed by enzyme assay and Western immunoblotting, respectively. To analyze the change of ganglioside profiles by the introduction of GD3 synthase gene, we performed a flow cytometric analysis. Among the gangliosides examined, the expression levels of GM1 and fucosyl-GM1 (major gangliosides in the parent cells) were reduced in the transfectants. The GD1b and GT1b levels were markedly increased in the transfectant cells (Fig.1 C). The ganglioside profiles of the control transfectants showed no changes (data not shown). These transfectant cells showed essentially no change in morphology compared with the parent cells or vector control cells (Fig. 2 A). When they were stimulated by NGF, the GD3 synthase transfectants did not show any neurite formation and kept their original round shape, whereas the parent cells and vector control cells responded to NGF by extending neurites. In addition to the neurite formation, the expression of neurofilament-M was analyzed as a biochemical marker of neuronal differentiation. Although the parent PC12 cells showed an ∼10 times increase of a neurofilament-M band after NGF treatment, the PC12/D3T-1 cells showed almost equal intensities of neurofilament-M bands before and after NGF treatment in accord with the results of neurite formation (Fig. 2 B). The quantitative analysis of the neurite formation revealed that only 5–10% of the PC12/D3T cells showed neurites, a less than 2-fold length of cell diameter even at day 4 of culture (Fig.3). About 25% of the PC12 cells transfected with vector alone showed neurites of lengths more than 2-fold the cell diameter, and neurites less than 2-fold the diameter were seen in more than 25% of the cells. The proliferation of the GD3 synthase gene transfectants and the control vector transfectants was compared. As shown in Fig.4 A, the GD3synthase gene transfectants showed tremendously rapid growth. The numbers of these transfectants were 4–5 times higher than those of the parent PC12 cells and vector transfectants at day 4 of culture. The BrdUrd incorporation was compared by staining with a specific antibody. In the presence of serum, the percentage of BrdUrd-positiveGD3 synthase gene transfectant cells was about 1.8 times the control cell value (Fig. 4 B). In the absence of serum, the transfectant cells still showed much better proliferation than controls (Fig. 4 C). When NGF was added, the transfectants showed slightly higher BrdUrd-positive rate than in non-serum condition, whereas the control cells also showed a little higher BrdUrd-positive cells (Fig. 4 D). To analyze the alteration of NGF receptor TrkA and its downstream signaling molecules, the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and ERK2) was examined by Western immunoblotting. As expected, both ERK1 and ERK2 were activated after NGF treatment in the parent cells and a vector control cell line (PC12V-1) (Fig.5 A, upper left). Surprisingly, the GD3 synthase gene transfectant cells showed strong activation regardless of NGF stimulation (Fig. 5 A, upper right). The Western immunoblots with anti-MAPK demonstrated that the lysates applied contained equivalent amounts of total ERK proteins, and ERK1 was more efficiently phosphorylated than ERK2 (Fig.5 A, lower). The time course of the tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA after NGF treatment was analyzed using immunoprecipitates and an anti-phospho-TrkA antibody. The parent cells and the vector controls showed a definite phosphorylation only after NGF treatment and then gradually reduced (Fig. 5 B, upper, data of PC12/V-1 are shown). In contrast, the GD3 synthase gene transfectant cells showed consistent strong bands before and after NGF treatment (Fig. 5 B, lower). The intensity of these phosphorylated bands was persistently strong regardless of NGF treatment for more than 2 h. The bottom of each panel illustrates the equal amounts of precipitated TrkA protein. The time course of MAPK phosphorylation then was examined. As shown in Fig. 5 C, both ERK1 and ERK2 were consistently phosphorylated regardless of NGF treatment in PC12/D3T-1, whereas they were phosphorylated only after NGF treatment, and then the activation levels gradually reduced in the vector controls. All these data corresponded with those of TrkA. To identify the signaling pathway that is involved in the enhanced proliferation in the GD3 synthase gene transfectant cells, the effects of various inhibitors of signaling molecules on the cell proliferation were analyzed. Treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A resulted in a complete suppression of the cell growth of parent PC12, PC12V-1, PC12/D3T-1, and PC12/D3T-2 cells (Fig.6 A). Effects of this inhibitor on TrkA and MAPK were confirmed in Western immunoblots, i.e.complete suppression of TrkA phosphorylation (Fig. 6 D) and reduction of MAPK activation to the control level (Fig. 6 E). When the Trk inhibitor K252a was used, no significant growth suppression was observed in the parent cells or the vector control transfectant cells (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, in theGD3 synthase gene transfectant cells, cell growth was markedly suppressed to the levels of parent PC12 or vector control transfectants. In this condition of the inhibition, the majority of the phosphorylation in TrkA and MAPK was suppressed (Fig. 6, Dand E). When the MEK inhibitor PD98059 was added, MAPK activation was markedly suppressed compared with the samples with no inhibitor (Fig. 6 E). Under this condition, it showed almost no effect on the parent cells or vector control transfectants (Fig.6 C); however, in the GD3 synthase gene transfectant cells, rapid cell growth was strongly suppressed, but their growth was still better than that of the parent and control cells. The effect of the PI3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin was examined; it showed only mild growth suppression in the GD3synthase gene transfectants, and no effect on the parent and vector control cells (data not shown). Thus, it was demonstrated that the increased proliferation of the GD3 synthase gene transfectants depended on Trk/Ras/ERK pathway. To analyze the molecular changes of TrkA in the GD3 synthase gene transfectants, the presence of the dimerized form of TrkA was examined by the cross-linking of TrkA with or without NGF treatment. In the parent PC12 and a vector control clone, dimerized high molecular weight bands were detected only after NGF treatment by an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 7). In contrast, in theGD3 synthase gene transfectant cells, dimerized bands existed without NGF stimulation and showed no significant changes in the intensity after NGF treatment. There have been a number of reports on the modulation of cell growth and/or differentiation by glycosphingolipids (28.Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18713-18716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these studies were performed by adding exogenous glycolipids into the culture medium of cell lines under investigation. The modulation of functions of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (29.Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Raines E. Ross R. J. Biol.

Res. 1997; 47: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and NGF receptor (22.Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Miyadai T. Hamaguchi M. Fujiki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5087-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) has been reported. In the majority of these studies, the gangliosides added suppressed the receptor functions based on the reduced phosphorylation of receptor molecules. Few studies have analyzed the effects of endogenously generated gangliosides (34.Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Nishi T. Hanai N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30451-30456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the functions of growth factor receptors. Our present study is thus quite novel as a functional analysis of glycosphingolipids by the genetic modification of their carbohydrate structures. PC12 cells show neuronal differentiation by neurite extension when stimulated by NGF (35.Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4862) Google Scholar). The main signals involved in this differentiation are transduced through TrkA phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 490, the subsequent Shc binding and Ras/Raf/MEK activation, and then ERK1/2 activation (36.Obermeier A. Bradshaw R.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 37.Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Brugge J.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 38.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar). The ganglioside GM1 has been reported to bind to TrkA and enhances the TrkA response to NGF stimulation, resulting in higher autophosphorylation (22.Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Miyadai T. Hamaguchi M. Fujiki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5087-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), more dimerization (39.Farooqui T. Franklin T. Pearl D.K. Yates A.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2348-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and better differentiation. In these cases, added GM1 did not change the time course of the signal transduction or the fate of PC12 cells but just regulates the reactivity of Trk receptor to NGF. In the GD3 synthase gene transfectants, modulation of the ganglioside profile resulted in an unexpected change in the quality of the signal pathway and a marked change of the cell fate. The new findings in the transfectant cells elucidated in this study are summarized as follows. First, continuous and autonomous TrkA phosphorylation and ERK1/2 activation without NGF treatment were observed. Second, the cells showed complete unresponsiveness to NGF in terms of neuronal differentiation. Third, the alteration of signal molecules resulted in the enhanced proliferation of the cells. Fourth, the results of experiments with inhibitors of various kinases revealed that the increased cell growth of the GD3 synthase gene transfectants depended on the activation of TrkA and ERKs which are involved in the differentiation of the parent PC12 cells. Fifth, persistent dimerization of TrkA regardless of NGF stimulation existed. How can the TrkA/Ras/ERK pathway be involved in both cell differentiation and proliferation? What is different in the signal pathway between NGF-treated PC12 and GD3 synthase gene transfectant cells? First, the activation time course of signaling might be critical. For signals through epidermal growth factor receptor leading PC12 to proliferation, a relatively short term activation of the Ras/MEK/MAPK pathway as detected by ERK activation induced PC12 cells to proliferate (40.Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), whereas relatively long-acting signals (e.g. by NGF) led the cell line to differentiation. In contrast, ERK1/2 was continuously activated and sustained at highly activated levels in the GD3 synthase gene transfectant cells, resulting in markedly increased proliferation. These findings indicate that the duration of the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway activation may not be an absolute factor to determine the cell fate. The magnitude of their activation might be more important. Second, modification of ganglioside components may cause the activation of another signaling pathway. Besides the TrkA/Ras/MEK/ERK pathway, phospholipase Cγ and PI3 kinase are also activated via Trk phosphorylation. Furthermore, other growth factor receptors, such as epidermal growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, might be activated by the carbohydrate modulation, although the kinase inhibition assay indicated the involvement of TrkA/ERK in the increased proliferation. GD1b and GT1b were the main species generated at higher rates after the introduction of GD3 synthase gene compared to before the introduction. Therefore, these two species might trigger the abnormal activation of the TrkA/ERK pathway by modulating the conformation of the TrkA molecule. Actually, GD1b and GT1b showed interesting and different effects on the proliferation and differentiation (data not shown) when exogenously added. Another point we need to consider is the effects of GM1 reduction, because addition of GM1 to the transfectant cells restored the reactivity to NGF in terms of TrkA activation (data not shown). In any case, the dimer formation of TrkA in the GD3 synthase gene transfectant cells as demonstrated here suggested that newly expressed and/or reduced gangliosides might modify the conformation of the TrkA molecule, resulting in the dimerization without NGF binding. The questions of 1) whether these gangliosides bind to TrkA and 2) what are the mechanisms underlying the conformational change and the dimer formation of TrkA in the presence of GD1b/GT1b are now under investigation in our laboratory. The results obtained in this study strongly suggested the important roles of endogenously generated gangliosides in the regulation of cell differentiation/proliferation. To clarify the molecular mechanisms for the regulatory role of GD3, it seems important to investigate the nuclear transport of ERK1/2 (40.Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar) and the internalization of the TrkA molecule (41.Eveleth D.D. Bradshaw R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in addition to the activation of individual signaling molecules in these transfectant cells. The differences of the resulting effects of GD3 synthase gene transfection between PC12 as shown here and Neuro2a (34.Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Nishi T. Hanai N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30451-30456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Liu H. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Tsuji S. Glycobiology. 1997; 8: 1067-1076Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) might be due to the differences in the profiles of pre-existing gangliosides in each cell line. Moreover, levels of expressed and activated transcription factors, which ERK1/2 regulates in individual cells such as c-Jun (43.Leppa S. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and a helix-loop-helix protein HES 1 (44.Strom A. Castella P. Rockwood J. Wagner J. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3168-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) are critical for the determination of cell fates and remain to be investigated. We thank Dr. Y. Yoshikai in the Laboratory of Host Defense and Germfree Life for providing the opportunity to use flow cytometry."

Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues probably involved in the enzymatic sphingomyelin cleavage as well as the removal of one or both putative transmembrane domains lead to the complete loss of enzymatic activity of human nSMase1 expressed in HEK293 cells. Polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant mammalian nSMase1 immunoprecipitated and inactivated the enzyme in membrane extracts of overexpressing HEK293 cells and different murine tissues. Cell fractionation combined with immunoprecipitation studies localized the nSMase1 protein predominantly in the microsomal fraction. The enzyme colocalized with marker proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus in immunocytochemistry. Anti-nSMase1 antibodies did not affect the nSMase activity in the plasma membrane fraction and membrane extracts from murine brain.

Therefore, increasing attention has been focused on neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinases and their participation in a variety of cellular processes in the recent past; however, their molecular characterization has resisted all attempts. In order to define the controversially discussed functions of SMases in cellular processes (19.Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10904-10909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20.Watts J.D. Gu M. Polverino A.J. Patterson S.D. Aebersold R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. 1998; 23: 374-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the isolation and molecular characterization of these enzymes is urgently needed. Recently, we described the cloning of the first mammalian neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase1) (23.Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). nSMase1 is a member of an extensive Mg2+-dependent phosphodiesterase family. The murine nSMase1 (mnSMase1) cDNA encodes a 419-amino acid residue protein, and the human enzyme, hnSMase1 (47.6 kDa), contains 423 residues. Both proteins show no obvious signal sequence. The hydrophobicity plot reveals two transmembrane domains in the C-terminal part and suggests a bitopic membrane topology with the N and C termini facing the cytosol. We describe in this report the expression of tagged nSMase1 in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, the affinity purification of the enzymatically active protein to apparent homogeneity, and subsequent biochemical characterization as well as studies on potential posttranslational modifications and site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues believed to be essential for catalytic activity. The enzymatic properties of the affinity-purified nSMase1 differ clearly from a recently published nSMase purified from rat brain (24.Liu B. Hassler D.F. Smith G.K. Weaver K. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34472-34479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies were raised against complete and truncated murine and human recombinant nSMase1 protein expressed in Escherichia coli in order to determine the subcellular distribution and tissue specificity of nSMase1. The subcellular localization of nSMase1 was established biochemically, by immunoprecipitation studies and immunofluorescence microscopy of transfected embryonic fibroblasts. These approaches underscore that the nSMase1 is predominantly localized in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. Anti-nSMase1-specific antibodies inactivated and precipitated the enzymatic activity from extracts of overexpressing HEK293 cells, different murine tissues, and microsomal fractions from murine liver homogenate but did not affect nSMase activity in brain extracts and plasma membrane fractions. We proved that the residual activity is contributed by at least one distinct nSMase2, residing in the plasma membrane and strongly expressed in brain. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Stably transfected clones were selected under 1 mg/ml Geneticin (G418; Life Technologies, Inc.). Transiently transfected cells were used 48 h after electroporation. nSMase activity was determined withN-[14CH3]sphingomyelin as substrate. Crude membrane extracts from tissues or HEK293 cells were mixed with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 1× Complete™ without EDTA (protease inhibitor set; Roche), and 10 nmol (60,000 dpm) of N-[14CH3]sphingomyelin in a total volume of 200 μl. After a 15–30-min incubation at 37 °C, 100 μl of H2O was added, and unreacted substrate was removed by extraction with 800 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v). 100 μl of the aqueous phase containing the enzymatically releasedN-[14CH3]phosphocholine was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Truncated (mnSMase1, aa 1–282; hnSMase1, aa 1–271) or complete nSMase1 cDNAs were fused to a C-terminal c-Myc/His6 tag derived from the plasmid vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen) and expressed in E. coli (BL21(DE3)pLysS) using the pET expression system (Novagen). Recombinant protein was purified from inclusion bodies using Talon™ (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rabbit anti-nSMase1 antibodies were raised against these different recombinant nSMase1 proteins. Recombinant proteins were coupled to BrCN-activated Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used for the affinity purification of nSMase1-directed antibodies. Aliquots of the purified antibodies were biotinylated usingd-biotinoyl-ε-aminocaproic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. Tissues of 3-month-old CD1 mice or of asmase(−/−) mice were homogenized in homogenization buffer (0.25 msucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2× Complete™ without EDTA) and centrifuged for 10 min at 900 × g. 5 mmDTT was included in the homogenization buffer only in samples used for measurement of sphingomyelinase activity. The sediment was extracted in homogenization buffer, 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g. Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Aliquots of the extracts (2 mg of protein each) were mixed with 50 μl of immobilized streptavidin (Roche) and incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle agitation. After removal of the streptavidin beads, 10 μl of rabbit anti-nSMase1 serum or preimmune serum was added to the extracts. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated by the addition of 50 μl of protein G coupled to cross-linked (4%) agarose beads (Sigma). After different washing steps, antigen-antibody complexes were dissociated by heating in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed with biotinylated purified anti-mnSMase1 antibody (1 μg/ml) followed by stringent washing and incubation with a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). After several washing steps, bands were visualized by chemiluminescence staining using SuperSignalSubstrate (Pierce). HEK293 cells stably transfected with the mnSMase1/pcDNA3.1/Myc-His construct were sedimented by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1× Complete™ without EDTA) and disrupted by repeated freezing and thawing. A crude membrane fraction was obtained by centrifugation for 5 min at 2700 × g. Membrane proteins were extracted by the addition of extraction buffer (lysis buffer plus 0.2% Triton X-100). Insoluble components were removed by ultracentrifugation. nSMase protein was purified by metal-chelating chromatography using Talon™ (CLONTECH) and immediately adjusted to 5 mm DTT and 20% glycerol. mnSMase1 protein was affinity-purified from HEK293 cells grown on 20 150-mm dishes as described above and separated by SDS-PAGE. The nSMase1 band was eluted from the gel and N-terminally sequenced by Edman degradation using a gas phase sequencer (model 477A; Applied Biosystems). Subcellular fractionation of mouse liver homogenate was performed according to the method of Fleischer and Kervina (25.Fleischer S. Kervina M. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 6-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of glucose-6-phosphatase was measured following the protocol of Swanson (26.Swanson M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 2: 541-543Crossref Scopus (488) Google Scholar) using 100 μg of protein, and the activity of 5′-nucleotidase was determined as described using 20 μg of protein (27.Widnell C.C. Unkeless J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 1050-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Modified hnSMase1 cDNAs were obtained by two standard polymerase chain reactions on the basis of the hnSMase1/pRc/CMV construct, each primed with an “external” and a modified “internal” oligonucleotide. The internal primers contained the modified codon and further silent mutations leading to an additional endonuclease recognition site, which was used to fuse the polymerase chain reaction products. The external primers allowed the cloning of the modified cDNAs back into the original expression vector. The numbers in parentheses indicate the position of the oligonucleotide in the human nSMase1-cDNA (s, sense; as, antisense), restriction sites are shown in italics, and bases differing from the original cDNA are depicted in underlined letters. External primers were as follows: 5′-CGT CCC CAC CGC GGC CGT CGC TGG-3′ (s289–312) and 5′-CTA TAG AAT AGG GCC CTC TAG ATG CAT G-3′ (pRc/CMV as978–1005). Internal primers were as follows: E49Q, 5′-GCT TTGCTC GAG CAA GTG TGG AGT G-3′ (s483–508); 5′-C ACT CCA CAC TTG CTC GAG CAA AGC-3′ (as483–508); N180H, 5′-GTG GAG ACC TC C AT A TGC ACC CAG A-3′ (s878–901), 5′-T CTG GGT GCA T AT G GA GGT CTC CAC-3′ (as878–901); H272N: 5′-CCC TCT CTG ATA ATG AAG CGC TGA TG-3′ (s1154–1179), 5′-CA TCA GCG CTT CAT TAT CAG AGA GGG-3′ (as1154–1179). Truncated constructs devoid of one or both putative transmembrane domains and the C terminus were generated by a single polymerase chain reaction with the oligonucleotide s289–312 (see above) and one of the following primers: −TM, −C terminus (5′-CTC TAG A TT AGC GAG CCT GAG CCA TGC CCA GAC-3′; 1292–1314); −2.TM, −C terminus (5′-CTC TAG A TT ATT CCC CGG CCC CTC CTC CAG CCG-3′; 1385–1407). A construct devoid of the transmembrane domains but including the C-terminal part of hnSMase1 was cloned by the method described above. The internal primers were used to insert a spacer of six amino acids (GPTNPG), which replaces the transmembrane domains between the N- and the C-terminal part of the protein: −TM, +C terminus (5′- GGG CCC ACC AAC CCC GGG CAC GTA CAG GAG GTC AAT GGC-3′ (s1474–1494) and 5′- CCC GGG GTT GGT GGG CCC GCG AGC CTG AGC CAT GCC CAG-3′ (as1294–1314)). RNA from transfected HEK293 cells was prepared following the protocol of Chomczynski and Sacchi (28.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and separated on 0.8–1% formaldehyde-agarose gels. After capillary transfer to GeneScreenPlus membranes (NEN Life Science Products), hybridization was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Blots were analyzed with a PhosphorImager 445 SI using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). 1.5 × 106 transiently transfected HEK293 cells were grown in methionine-free Eagle's medium for 1 h and labeled with 150 μCi ofl-[35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in extraction buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mmEDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1× Complete™ medium without EDTA). Insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation. nSMase1 protein was precipitated from the extracts by the addition of affinity-purified anti-hnSMase1 antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) and gentle agitation for 1 h at 4 °C in each case. Sepharose was washed stringently and treated with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%). The gel was dried and analyzed on a PhosphorImager 445 SI (Molecular Dynamics). 107exponentially growing mouse primary embryonic fibroblasts (EMFIs) were electroporated with mnSMase1-pRc/CMV, and 48 h later they were used for immunohistochemistry. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and lysed with PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100. After blocking with PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated with the anti-mnSMase1 antibody together with anti-Grp78 (Bip; Biomol), anti-58K (Clone 58K9; Sigma), or anti-α-tubulin (clone B-5-1-2; Sigma) in PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were washed with PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 and PBS three times each and incubated with a Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and a Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), washed and analyzed with a Leica confocal microscope. Human primary fibroblasts were transiently transfected with hnSMase1-pRc/CMV and hnSMase1-pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen) for 48 h, respectively, and analyzed as described above. Complete or truncated murine and human nSMase1 cDNAs (23.Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) were fused to an N-terminal Myc-His6-tag and expressed in E. coli. SDS-PAGE of the bacterial homogenate indicated that the recombinant protein was present in inclusion bodies. The tagged nSMase1 protein was solubilized either in 8 m urea or SDS-Triton X-100, adsorbed to a metal-chelating column (Talon®), and desorbed by increasing imidazole concentrations from the thoroughly washed column. All attempts to renature the purified nSMase1 released with 8m urea from inclusion bodies were unsuccessful. Rabbit anti-nSMase1 antibodies were raised against the different recombinant nSMase1 proteins and purified by absorbing to the immobilized antigen. The antibodies specifically recognize the nSMase1 protein in membrane extracts from stably transfected HEK293 cells (Fig.1 B). HEK293 cells were stably transfected with nSMase1 cDNA cloned into the eukaryotic expression vectors pRc/CMV and pcDNA 3.1 Myc-His6. Expression of wild type, mock-transfected cell lines and selected clones was compared on the mRNA level by Northern and on the protein level by Western blot analysis and in addition by the enzyme assay (data not shown). HEK293 cells transfected with the tagged and wild type nSMase1 cDNA expressed the enzyme at a similar rate. Tagged nSMase1 was purified to apparent homogeneity by metal-chelating affinity chromatography from overexpressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 1 A). The flow-through of the affinity column showed no significantly increased nSMase activity compared with membrane extracts from mock-transfected HEK293 cells, demonstrating that the tagged protein is directly responsible for the increased nSMase activity in transfected cells. The enzymatic properties of nSMase1 were unimpaired by the C-terminally fused c-Myc-His6-tag. We could not detect any other copurified protein compounds. The specific activity of the affinity purified enzyme was enriched 50 times compared with its activity in the crude membrane extract (50 versus 1 μmol of sphingomyelin/h/mg of protein), but the total nSMase activity was reduced dramatically. The loss of activity is caused very likely by the absence of reducing DTT or mercaptoethanol essential in enzyme purification but fatal for the matrix of the affinity column. Increasing purity also reduced the enzyme stability. Reducing agents added after affinity purification were unable to restore the nSMase1 activity. However, the affinity-purified nSMase1 was used for detailed examination of its enzymatic properties. Purified nSMase1 showed a neutral pH optimum and no detectable activity against phosphatidylcholine. The enzyme was inactive without magnesium and manganese ions in the assay mixture. Both divalent cations activated the enzyme but showed different kinetics. Mg2+(K a = 80 μm) was effective even at high concentrations up to 10 mm, while Mn2+(K a = 15 μm) inhibited the enzyme at concentrations above 0.5 mm as described before by Hostetler and Yazaki (29.Hostetler K.Y. Yazaki P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 456-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for neutral sphingomyelinase from rat liver homogenate (Fig. 2 A). It reveals a direct activation by arachidonic acid (K a= 20 μm) (Fig. 2 B) but no detectable stimulation by the phospholipid phosphatidylserine (10–200 μm) or inhibition at physiological glutathione concentrations as described recently for a brain-specific nSMase (24.Liu B. Hassler D.F. Smith G.K. Weaver K. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34472-34479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Recombinant hnSMase1 and mnSMase1 purified either from E. coli or from membrane extracts of HEK293 cells constantly deviated by 6–7 kDa in molecular mass in SDS-PAGE from the calculated sizes of 47.5 and 47.6 kDa for mnSMase1 and hnSMase1 and 50.8 kDa for the tagged murine protein, respectively (Fig. 3). The band at 42 kDa represents mnSMase1, and the faint 80-kDa band represents the dimer (Fig. 3, A (lane 2) and B(lane 1)). The latter was transformed to the monomeric 42-kDa band by treatment with the reducing agent DTT (Fig.3 B, lane 2) and by reductive carboxymethylation (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). Dimerization through disulfide bonds is obviously an artifact of the purification. This interpretation is supported by the rapid loss of enzyme activity in the absence of reducing SH reagents. mnSMase1 and hnSMase1 contain one and two putative consensus sequences for N-glycosylation. Endoglycosidase H andN-glycosidase F treatment did not alter the electrophoretic mobility of the 42-kDa protein band in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, no evidence for glycosylation of native and mature nSMase1 can be found on the basis of our experiments. mnSMase1 contains 17 cysteines, eight of which are conserved in hnSMase1. 16 cysteines are located in the putative cytosolic part of the protein and therefore in the reducing environment, which makes disulfide bonds highly unlikely. Other possible causes for the reduced apparent molecular mass were excluded; Edman degradation of the affinity-purified nSMase1 from HEK293 cells revealed that the translation starts at the first possible methionine in the proposed nSMase1 peptide sequence and that no N-terminal proteolytic truncation had occurred. The successful affinity purification of the C-terminally tagged enzyme protein excludes also a C-terminal proteolysis, which could account for the derived molecular mass of 42 kDa of nSMase1 in SDS-PAGE. The discrepancy between the calculated and electrophoretic mobility derived molecular mass may be due to a frequently observed unusual SDS binding of the hydrophobic protein domains. nSMase1 belongs to a large family of phosphodiesterases including mammalian DNaseI, phospholipase C from S. aureus, and bacterial sphingomyelinases. They reveal species-independent identical motifs. This suggests their essential function in the catalysis of the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bonds. Relevant to this study is the prediction of analogous amino acid residues in the hnSMase1 derived from x-ray crystallography of DNaseI (30.Oefner C. Suck D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 605-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). They are either involved in Mg2+ complexing (Glu49) or substrate binding (Asp111, Tyr141, and Asn180) or are essential for acid (His151) and base (His272) catalysis and the stabilization of the pentavalent transition state of the phosphorus (Asp251). The hnSMase1 constructs for the analysis of the putative functions of the respective amino acid residue side chains are given in Fig.4. We also studied the function of the two putative transmembrane (TM) domains. hnSMase1 constructs devoid of the C-terminal part of the protein and one or both TM domains were established as well as a construct with the TM helices replaced by the hexapeptide GPTNPG. The two prolines within the peptide should allow the back-folding of the C-terminal domain into the predicted conformation of the mature nSMase1. Point-mutated and truncated constructs of hnSMase1 were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. nSMase1 mRNA was quantitated by Northern blot hybridization analysis (Fig. 5,A and B). Proteins, immunoprecipitated from membrane extracts of [35S]methionine metabolically labeled HEK293 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and quantitated by autoradiographic analysis (Fig. 5 C). Specific nSMase activity was measured in the membrane extracts and the 2700 ×g supernatant (Fig. 5, D.1 and D.2). Wild type and the point mutations E49Q, N180H, and H272N showed an almost identical expression on the mRNA and protein level, but only cells transfected with wild type hnSMase1 revealed an increase of nSMase activity. The Northern blot signals of the truncated nSMase1 transcripts were reduced and the protein signals hardly visible in autoradiography. No increase of nSMase activity was measured in cells transfected with this cDNA expression constructs. Furthermore, the truncated nSMase1 proteins were not detectable in immunofluorescence (data not shown). In a first approach, Western blot analysis with affinity-purified anti-nSMase antibodies produces only weak signals due to the very low nSMase1 protein concentration in the different murine tissues examined. Therefore, an immunoprecipitation step was performed prior to the Western blot analysis; nSMase1 protein was enriched from the solubilized 2700 × g sediment derived from tissue homogenates by immunoprecipitation with mnSMase1-specific affinity-purified antibodies and subsequent adsorbtion to protein G-Sepharose. The immunocomplex was disrupted by heating in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using biotinylated anti-mnSMase antibodies. The signal intensities in Western blot analysis (Fig. 6) corresponded well to those in Northern blot analysis described previously (23.Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The absence of a signal in jejunum is probably due to the high proteolytic activity in this tissue. A comparison of the expression in these tissues on the transcriptional (Northern blot signals) and translational level (Western blot signals) with their nSMase activity, however, revealed a striking difference, particularly in the brain homogenate. Immunoprecipitation studies performed with membrane extracts from stably mnSMase-transfected HEK293 cells revealed a specific and quantitative precipitation of nSMase1 activity and protein using purified anti-mnSMase1 antibodies and protein G-Sepharose, subsequently (Fig. 7). An immunoprecipitation study in different murine tissues combined with nSMase activity measurement in the supernatant after the precipitation should answer the question of whether nSMase1 is responsible for the high enzymatic activity in brain despite its low protein amount compared with the other tissues."

This mechanism appears to require both cleavage of the serpin reactive center loop (RCL) by the proteinase and a significant conformational change in the serpin structure involving rapid insertion of the RCL into the center of an existing β-sheet, serpin β-sheet A. The present study demonstrates that partitioning between inhibitor and substrate modes of reaction can be altered by varying either the rates of RCL insertion or deacylation using a library of serpin RCL mutants substituted in the critical P14 hinge residue and three different proteinases. We further correlate the changes in partitioning with the actual rates of RCL insertion for several of the variants upon reaction with the different proteinases as determined by fluorescence spectroscopy of specific RCL-labeled inhibitor mutants. These data demonstrate that the serpin mechanism follows a branched pathway, and that the formation of a stable inhibited complex is dependent upon both the rate of the RCL conformational change and the rate of enzyme deacylation.

Current understanding of serpin structure is based largely on seminal x-ray crystallographic studies by Loebermann and co-workers (4.Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol.

An interesting feature of this structure was that the two residues normally comprising the reactive center (Met-Ser) peptide bond were found on opposite ends of the molecule, separated by almost 70 Å. Based on this structure, these authors proposed a model structure for native serpins, where the reactive center is part of an exposed loop, referred to as the reactive center loop (RCL)1 (4.Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Upon cleavage, the RCL integrates into the center of the dominant serpin structural feature, β-sheet A, becoming strand four of this six-stranded β-sheet. This transformation is accompanied by a large increase in thermal stability, presumably due to reorganization of the five-stranded β-sheet A to a six-stranded anti-parallel form (5.Carrell R.W.

As a critical test of this hypothesis, we have examined whether the partitioning of inhibitory versus substrate activity is governed by the relative rates of RCL insertionversus deacylation of the intermediate acyl-enzyme complex. This was accomplished by perturbing the rates of loop insertion and enzyme deacylation through mutation of the P14 hinge residue of the RCL, which initiates loop insertion, and through varying the target proteinase. The results presented strongly support the branched pathway mechanism of serpin inhibition and are not consistent with the alternative model of serpin behavior, which suggests that serpins exist in distinct inhibitory and substrate conformations that react by independent pathways (35.Declerck P.J.

In the present study, we use plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as a model to test the hypothesis that insertion of the serpin RCL into β-sheet A is coupled to proteinase cleavage of the RCL, and that as a result of this coupling serpin inhibition follows a branched pathway leading to either a stable inhibited complex or turnover of the serpin as a substrate. As a critical test of this hypothesis, we have examined whether the partitioning of inhibitory versus substrate activity is governed by the relative rates of RCL insertionversus deacylation of the intermediate acyl-enzyme complex. This was accomplished by perturbing the rates of loop insertion and enzyme deacylation through mutation of the P14 hinge residue of the RCL, which initiates loop insertion, and through varying the target proteinase. The results presented strongly support the branched pathway mechanism of serpin inhibition and are not consistent with the alternative model of serpin behavior, which suggests that serpins exist in distinct inhibitory and substrate conformations that react by independent pathways (35.Declerck P.J.

The recombinant enzyme exhibited the same substrate specificity as the native enzyme, utilizing acetyl-CoA and adenine nucleotides as preferred substrates and less efficiently, propionyl- and succinyl-CoA. N- and C-terminal parts of the G. lamblia acetyl-CoA synthetase sequence were found to be homologous to the α- and β-subunits, respectively, of succinyl-CoA synthetase. Sequence analysis of homologous enzymes from various bacteria, archaea, and the eukaryote, Plasmodium falciparum, identified conserved features in their organization, which allowed us to delineate a new superfamily of acyl-CoA synthetases (nucleoside diphosphate-forming) and its signature motifs. The representatives of this new superfamily of thiokinases vary in their domain arrangement, some consisting of separate α- and β-subunits and others comprising fusion proteins in α-β or β-α orientation. The presence of homologs of acetyl-CoA synthetase (ADP-forming) in such human pathogens as G. lamblia, Yersinia pestis, Bordetella pertussis,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae,Salmonella typhi, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and the malaria agent P. falciparum suggests that they might be used as potential drug targets.

Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1986; 58: 141-172PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of NTP in this reaction leads to the liberation of CoA and a free organic acid (Equation 1). R­CO­S­CoA+NDP+Pi↔R­COO−+CoA­SH+NTPEquation 1 Enzymes catalyzing this process play central roles in energy metabolism. Based on the reverse reaction, they are usually referred to as acid thiokinases or acyl-CoA synthetases (NDP1- forming). The most studied representative of this enzyme group is succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS; R = COOH-CH2-CH2-), a component of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (1.Nishimura J.S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1986; 58: 141-172PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Bridger W.A. Wolodko W.T. Henning W. Upton C. Majumdar R. Williams S.P. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1987; 54: 103-111PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotes this enzyme has a mitochondrial/hydrogenosomal location (3.Jenkins T.M. Gorrell T.E. Müller M. Weitzman P.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The two eukaryotic isoenzymes, specific for either ATP (EC 6.2.1.5) or GTP (EC 6.2.1.4), are heterodimers composed of an α- and a β-subunit. In vertebrates, the α-subunit of both enzymes is coded by the same gene, whereas the β-subunits derive from separate genes (4.Johnson J.D. Mehus J.G. Tews K. Milavetz B.I. Lambeth D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27580-27586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Gram-positive bacteria also harbor a heterodimeric enzyme, whereas the SCSs fromEscherichia coli and other Gram-negative bacteria are heterotetramers of two α- and two β-subunits and have broader specificity for the nucleotide substrate, preferring adenine to guanine nucleotides (5.Weitzman P.D. Kinghorn H.A. FEBS Lett. 1978; 88: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A somewhat similar enzyme acting on acetyl-CoA instead of succinyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) (ADP-forming; EC 6.2.1.13; R = CH3-), has been detected in certain amitochondriate eukaryotes without metabolic compartmentalization (type I amitochondriates) (6.Reeves R.E.

Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 109-131Google Scholar) and in several archaea (9.Glasemacher J. Bock A.-K. Schmid R. Schönheit P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These organisms lack a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle, and substrate level phosphorylation of ADP or GDP by acetyl-CoA synthetase seems to play a role that is comparable with that of succinyl-CoA synthetase in organisms with functional tricarboxylic acid cycles. Recent biochemical analysis of the eukaryotic (from the diplomonadGiardia lamblia) and archaeal (from the hyperthermophilePyrococcus furiosus) acetyl-CoA synthetases revealed both similarities and differences between these enzymes. The two ACSs studied from P. furiosus are heterotetramers (α2-β2) of broad substrate specificity that are able to utilize ATP, GTP, and several acyl-CoA esters with comparable efficiencies (9.Glasemacher J. Bock A.-K. Schmid R. Schönheit P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10.Mai X. Adams M.W.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5897-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, the G. lambliaACS is composed of a single polypeptide chain, and the enzyme preferentially uses adenine nucleotides and acetyl-CoA (7.Sánchez L.B. Müller M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11.Sánchez L.B. Morrison H.G. Sogin M.L. Müller M. Gene. 1999; 233: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When the sequence of a putative acetyl-CoA synthetase was cloned fromG. lamblia (GenBank™ accession number AF107206) (11.Sánchez L.B. Morrison H.G. Sogin M.L. Müller M. Gene. 1999; 233: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) it showed no detectable similarity to the major types of previously sequenced enzymes that are capable of acetyl-CoA synthesis, that is acetyl-CoA synthetase (AMP-forming, EC 6.2.1.1, (12.Kumari S. Tishel R. Eisenbach M. Wolfe A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2878-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar)) and phosphotransacetylase (EC 2.3.1.8) (13.Matsuyama A. Yamamoto-Otake H. Hewitt J. MacGillivray R.T. Nakano E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Instead it appeared to be similar to the succinyl-CoA synthetase sequences from a variety of sources. To verify that the gene cloned from G. lambliaindeed coded for an ACS, we have expressed it in E. coli and characterized the properties of the resulting recombinant protein. Here we report the substrate specificity of the recombinant G. lamblia ACS and compare it with a number of previously uncharacterized proteins identified in the course of microbial genome sequencing projects. Our results indicate that ACSs and ACS-like proteins form a so far unrecognized enzyme superfamily with succinyl-CoA synthetases, malate thiokinase, and ATP citrate lyase. We present here the definition of this superfamily and its signature sequence motifs. The G. lamblia ACS gene was cloned in the plasmid vector pQE-32 (Qiagen) as described previously (11.Sánchez L.B. Morrison H.G. Sogin M.L. Müller M. Gene. 1999; 233: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). E. coli M15(pREP4) strain containing the recombinant plasmid construct was grown at 37 °C in LB broth containing 100 μg·ml−1 ampicillin to an OD600 of 0.6 and induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 37 °C. The cultures were centrifuged at 4000 ×g for 15 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 μg·ml−1leupeptin and 1 μg-ml−1 lysozyme. After incubation for 30 min on ice the suspension was sonicated by 6 pulses of 10 s and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was mixed with 5 volumes of 50% Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen), pre-equilibrated with 300 mm NaCl in 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 8.0 (Buffer A), incubated for 60 min at 4 °C, and poured into a column. Unbound proteins were removed by washing the resin with 5 volumes of Buffer A and 5 volumes of 5 mm imidazole in Buffer A. The bound protein was eluted with 150 mm imidazole in Buffer A. Fractions containing the ACS activity were pooled, desalted, concentrated using a Centricon concentrator (Amicon, 50-kDa cutoff), and stored at −20 °C. The ACS activity was measured in the direction of ATP synthesis (forward reaction) by following the ADP-dependent release of coenzyme A from acyl-CoA using the thiol reagent 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). The standard reaction mixture contained 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ADP, 40 mm potassium phosphate, 0.1 mm DTNB in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.05 mm of an acyl-CoA ester. The substrates tested were acetyl-, N-propionyl-, N-butyryl-, isobutyryl-, isovaleryl-, succinyl-, malonyl-, or glutaryl-CoA. The increase in absorbance at 412 nm was followed for 10 min at 30 °C (ε412 = 13,600m−1·cm−1). For the reverse reaction in the thiokinase direction the activity was determined by the following: 1) the formation of acylhydroxamate at 505 nm, in an assay mixture containing 5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CoA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm sodium acetate in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and after incubation at 30 °C, 1 volume of 10% FeCl2 in 0.7 N HCl was added; or 2) the formation of ADP, coupling the reaction with pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase and monitoring the oxidation of NADH; and 3) titration of the unreacted CoA with DTNB as described above. Sequence similarity searches against the non-redundant protein data base maintained at the NCBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, were performed using PSI-BLAST (14.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zheng Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) with the G. lamblia ACS sequence as a query. Based on the initial results each identified domain was used as a separate query for PSI-BLAST run to convergence. The data base hits identified this way were used as queries for subsequent searches.

The multiple sequence alignment was constructed using ClustalW (15.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

Zheng Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic relationships were analyzed using the maximum likelihood method (16.Kishino H. Miyata T. Hasegawa M. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 151-160Crossref Scopus (652) Google Scholar) based on ClustalW and PSI-BLAST alignments performed with the PROTML program, version 2.3 (17.Adachi J. Hasegawa M. Computer Science Monographs, No. 28. Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo1996: 1-150Google Scholar). The maximum likelihood tree was obtained by local rearrangement of a neighbor-joining tree using the Jones, Taylor, and Thornton model of amino acid substitutions (18.Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar). Bootstrap support was calculated with the resampling estimated log-liklihood method (17.Adachi J. Hasegawa M.

https://openalex.org/W2160753576,"Most non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors are specific for HIV-1 RT and demonstrate minimal inhibition of HIV-2 RT. However, we report that members of the phenylethylthiazolylthiourea (PETT) series of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors showing high potency against HIV-1 RT have varying abilities to inhibit HIV-2 RT. Thus, PETT-1 inhibits HIV-1 RT with an IC50 of 6 nm but shows only weak inhibition of HIV-2 RT, whereas PETT-2 retains similar potency against HIV-1 RT (IC50 of 5 nm) and also inhibits HIV-2 RT (IC50 of 2.2 μm). X-ray crystallographic structure determinations of PETT-1 and PETT-2 in complexes with HIV-1 RT reveal the compounds bind in an overall similar conformation albeit with some differences in their interactions with the protein. To investigate whether PETT-2 could be acting at a different site on HIV-2 RT (e.g. the dNTP or template primer binding site), we compared modes of inhibition for PETT-2 against HIV-1 and HIV-2 RT. PETT-2 was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to the dGTP substrate for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs. PETT-2 was also a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to a poly(rC)·(dG) template primer for HIV-2 RT. These results are consistent with PETT-2 binding in corresponding pockets in both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RT with amino acid sequence differences in HIV-2 RT affecting the binding of PETT-2 compared with PETT-1.

The regimens are based on inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), together with protease inhibitors. RT catalyzes the conversion of genomic RNA to proviral DNA, by RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, RNase H, and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase reactions. The well established nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based drugs (e.g.3′-azido-2′,3′-deoxythymidine, 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine, and 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine) act as terminators of RT catalyzed DNA synthesis in their activated triphosphate forms. Nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors are relatively broad spectrum drugs that inhibit both HIV-1 and HIV-2 serotypes with comparable potency (3.De Clercq E. Med. Res. Rev. 1993; 13: 229-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). More recently non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTIs) nevirapine, delavirdine, and efavirenz have established an important role in combination therapy of HIV infection. NNRTIs include a wide range of chemical series and are usually specific for HIV-1 RT, showing minimal inhibition of HIV-2 RT. A series of biaryl acids has been reported that inhibit both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RT, although these appear not to bind at the NNRTI site (4.Milton J. Slater M.J. Bird A.J. Spinks D. Scott G. Price C.E. Downing S. Green D.V. Madar S. Bethell R. Stammers D.K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 2623-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). NNRTIs such as nevirapine generally act as noncompetitive inhibitors of HIV-1 RT with respect to substrates (5.Merluzzi V.J. Hargrave K.D. Labadia M. Grozinger K. Skoog M. Wu J.C. Shih C.-K.

The NNRTI binding site is contained largely within the p66 subunit of the RT heterodimer with only a few residues at the periphery of the site being contributed by the p51 subunit. The mechanism of inhibition for NNRTIs has been shown to be via a distortion of the key catalytic active site aspartyl residues (9.Esnouf R. Ren J. Ross C. Jones Y. Stammers D. Stuart D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). One series of NNRTIs previously described is the phenylethylthiazoylthiourea (PETT) series that have been shown to have potent activity against both HIV-1 virus and it's RT (10.Ahgren C. Backro K.

In this work we report structural and biochemical studies for two members of this series referred to as PETT-1 and PETT-2 (SchemeFS1). Most NNRTIs rapidly select for drug-resistant HIV-1 strains, both in tissue culture and in clinical studies, which has largely precluded their use as monotherapy (17.Richman D.D. Havlir D. Corbeil J. Looney D. Ignacio C. Spector S.A. Sullivan J. Cheeseman S. Barringer K. Pauletti D. Shih C.-K. Myers M. Griffin J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1660-1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the “first-generation” drugs, nevirapine and delavirdine, the so-called “second-generation” NNRTI drug, efavirenz, demonstrates resilience to the effects of certain common resistance mutations (18.Young S.D. Britcher S.F. Tran L.O. Payne L.S. Lumma W.C. Lyle T.A. Huff J.R. Anderson P.S. Olsen D.B. Carroll S.S. Pettibone D.J. O'Brien J.A. Ball R.G. Balani S.K. Lin J.H. Chen I.-W. Schleif W.A. Sardana V.V. Long W.J. Byrnes V.W. Emini E.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2602-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). However resistance to such compounds is emerging, meaning that there is a continued need for the development of new drugs to combat such mutant viruses. The HIV-2 serotype was isolated three years after the identification of HIV-1 (19.Clavel F. Guyader M. Guetard D. Salle M. Montagnier L. Alizon M. Nature. 1986; 324: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 20.Guyader M. Emerman M. Sonigo P. Clavel F. Montagnier L. Alizon M. Nature. 1987; 326: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) and was shown to be closely related to SIVmac. HIV-2 RT has approximately 60% overall amino acid sequence identity with HIV-1 RT and has comparable polymerase activity (21.Hizi A. Tal R. Shaharabany M. Loya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6230-6239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are, however, significant sequence changes for amino acids lining the equivalent region to the HIV-1 NNRTI binding pocket within HIV-2 RT, which presumably explains the poor binding of NNRTIs for this latter enzyme. Thus, the tyrosine residues at 181 and 188 in HIV-1 RT, whose side chains are important in aromatic ring-stacking interactions with many NNRTIs (6.Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A.

The direct role of amino acid sequence changes is confirmed by studies of chimeric HIV-1/HIV-2 RTs where several residues from HIV-1 have to be incorporated into an HIV-2 chimera to give sensitivity to NNRTIs approaching that for wild-type HIV-1 RT (28.Shih C.-O.

We report studies on two NNRTIs of the PETT series and show that they vary in their ability to inhibit HIV-2 RT. Additionally we have determined the crystal structures of these inhibitors complexed with HIV-1 RT. We also describe kinetic studies comparing the modes of inhibition for the PETT compounds with HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs to address the possibility of alternative binding sites on HIV-2 RT for PETT-2. Crystals of the complex of HIV-1 RT with PETT-2 were grown as described previously (30.Stammers D.K. Somers D.O.N. Ross C.K. Kirby I. Ray P.H. Wilson J.E. Norman M. Ren J.S. Esnouf R.M. Garman E.F.

Crystals were either frozen in liquid propane and maintained at 100 K during data collection (RT/PETT-1) or maintained at 288 K (RT/PETT-2). Data frames of 1.5° oscillations were collected on a MAR image plate with exposure times of 90 s for RT/PETT-1. For RT/PETT-2, 3.5° frames with a coupling constant 1.5°/mm and an exposure time of 112 s were recorded on pairs of 200 × 400 mm Fuji Bas-IIIB imaging plates positioned 429.7 mm from the crystal on a cylindrical cassette. To reduce background noise, the collimator, crystal enclosure, and camera cassette were flooded with helium. The imaging plates were scanned off-line using Fuji BA 100 IP scanners.

Table Isummarizes these refinement statistics. The coordinates and structure factors for the RT/PETT-1 and RT/PETT-2 complexes have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank. HIV-2 RT (pROD) was expressed and purified using methods described previously for HIV-1 RT (37.Stammers D.K. Tisdale M. Court S. Parmar V. Bradley C. Ross C.K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38.Stammers D.K. Ross C.K. Idriss H. Lowe D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Assays for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs were carried out using the methods described previously (39.Lowe D.M. Aitken A. Bradley C. Darby G.K. Larder B.A. Powell K.L. Purifoy D.J.M. Tisdale M. Stammers D.K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8884-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), but with poly(rC)·(dG)12–18 as the template primer and with the incorporation of [3H]dGTP into DNA to follow the reaction. IC50 values for PETT-1 and PETT-2 were determined at template-primer and substrate concentrations of 50 μg/ml poly(rC)·(dG) and 5 μmdGTP, respectively, with variation of inhibitor concentrations on a log scale. Inhibition curves were fitted by nonlinear regression methods using ORIGIN (Microcal Software Inc.). The mode of inhibition studies and K i determinations were carried out using a protocol involving a 4 × 5 matrix of varying substrate and inhibitor concentrations over ranges of [S]/[K m] from 0.5 to 7 and [I]/[K i] from 0.5 to 10 (40.Stammers D.K. Dann J.G. Harris C.J. Smith D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In each case when either dGTP or template primer was not being varied in concentration, then it was held at saturating levels (i.e. 30 μm dGTP or 50 μg/ml poly(rC)·(dG)). Duplicate measurements were made for each experimental point. Between 2 and 4 replicate experiments were performed, and these were scaled together prior to curve fitting. Data were fitted to standard enzyme inhibition models (i.e.competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, and mixed) using GRAFIT (Erithacus Software). The best fit was judged from the residual χ2 values, the run of signs of the residuals, and percentage errors in the fitted parameters. A summary of the refinement statistics for the RT/PETT complexes is shown in Table I. Both structures have excellent stereochemistry. The electron density for each structure is of good quality particularly in the region of the well ordered NNRTI binding site. Omit electron density maps for the inhibitors are very clear (Fig. 1). The orientation of PETT-1 and PETT-2 within the NNRTI binding site could be determined unambiguously due to the presence of clear electron density for the thioether and the two pyridinyl rings. The ether substituent of ring A, which is common to both compounds, could be clearly distinguished from the less bulky nitrile or chlorine group of the B rings (Fig. 1). Both compounds adopt similar conformations when bound to RT such that their aromatic rings are positioned approximately at right angles, whereas the linking group is folded in a somewhat constrained nonextended conformation (Fig.2). There is an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the ring B pyridinyl nitrogen and one of the nitrogen atoms of the thiourea group. Comparison of PETT inhibitors with other examples of NNRTIs, viz. nevirapine and TIBO, reveals that these inhibitors adopt conformations that occupy similar volumes of space within the drug pocket despite their diverse chemical structures (Fig. 3).Figure 3. Stereo diagram showing the relative orientations and positions of nevirapine (cyan), PETT-1 (red), and Cl-TIBO (yellow). The superimposition was carried out as described previously (7.Ren J.

These are predominantly hydrophobic in nature but with some polar interactions also present. The larger nitrile substituent on ring B of PETT-1 compared with the chloro of PETT-2 alters the contacts in several places. Thus although ring A of both compounds is positioned at the “top” of the NNRTI pocket forming ring-stacking interactions with the side chains of both Tyr-181 and Tyr-188, the latter has more contacts with PETT-2 than with PETT-1. PETT-2 also makes a number of contacts with the side chain of Leu-100. The nitrile group of PETT-1 has extensive contacts with residues Leu-234, His-235, Pro-236, and Tyr-318, whereas the equivalent chlorine group of PETT-2 has few contacts with this region. The side chain of Glu-138 from the p51 subunit is positioned closer to the NNRTI pocket than for other inhibitor complexes (7.Ren J. Esnouf R. Garman E. Somers D. Ross C. Kirby I. Keeling J. Darby G. Jones Y. Stuart D. Stammers D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), allowing contacts with ring A for both PETT-1 and PETT-2. The sulfur atom of the thiourea group makes a number of van der Waals contacts with the backbone of Lys-101. There is a single hydrogen bond to the main chain, from one of the thiourea nitrogens to the carbonyl of Lys-101. The results of the IC50 determinations for PETT inhibition of the RTs are shown in Fig. 5. Both PETT-1 and PETT-2 inhibit HIV-1 RT with similar IC50 values in the low nm range (6 and 5 nm, respectively) (Fig.5). For HIV-2 RT, PETT-2 gave an IC50 of 2.2 μm, whereas for PETT-1 a maximum of 20% inhibition at 50 μm was observed, meaning that it was not possible to determine an IC50 value. Results of studies to determine the mode of inhibition of PETT-2 against HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs are shown in Tables II and III and in Figs.6 and 7. A comparison of χ2 values for different models shows that with dGTP as the varying substrate, the noncompetitive model was strongly preferred over the competitive model for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RT (Table II). For poly(rC)·(dG) as the varying substrate the discrimination between the different models was lower, although noncompetitive inhibition was preferred for HIV-2 RT in all experiments performed, whereas for HIV-1 RT mixed or uncompetitive modes were preferred (Table II). The K i values (Table III) generally agree with the corresponding IC50 values (Fig. 5).Table IIComparison of models for PETT-2 inhibition of HIV-1 RT or HIV-2 RT with either dGTP or poly(rC) · oligo(dG12–18) as varying substrate from non-linear regression analysisReduced χ2(×10−3)Varying substratedGTPPoly(rC) · (dG)12–18ModelHIV-1 RTHIV-2 RTHIV-1 RTHIV-2 RTCompetitive24.579.32.70.89Mixed0.668.50.300.49Noncompetitive0.627.90.430.46Uncompetitive6.416.50.290.53χ2 is defined as Σ (Δγi/ςi)2, where Δγi is the difference between calculated and observed data points and ςi is the variance of data point i.

PETT-1 and PETT-2 differ only at the paraposition of the B ring (nitrile or chlorine, respectively), yet they show differing ability to inhibit HIV-2 RT. Although PETT-2 is a much weaker inhibitor of HIV-2 RT than it is of HIV-1 RT, such a relatively high level of inhibition of HIV-2 RT by an NNRTI is unusual. Recently the inhibitory activity of the NNRTIs delavirdine and emivirine, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range, have been reported against HIV-2 (EHO strain) in MT-4 cell cultures, although their activities against HIV-2 RT appeared minimal (41.Witvrouw M. Pannecouque C. Van Laethem K. Desmyter J. De Clercq E. Vandamme A.M. AIDS. 1999; 13: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Crystallographic structure determinations of complexes of PETT-1 and PETT-2 with HIV-1 RT reveal that the overall mode of binding of both inhibitors adheres to the “two ring” conformation observed for a range of other chemically diverse NNRTI series (7.Ren J.

Chem. 1999; 42: 3845-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). There are some differences between the interactions of the two PETT compounds with the NNRTI site. These appear to be related to the larger nitrile substituent on the B ring of PETT-1, which results in closer contacts with the main chain of residues 234 to 236, whereas PETT-2 makes slightly closer contacts with Tyr-188. The PETT conformations described here are generally in agreement with modeling studies, where the hydrogen bonding to the main chain of Lys-101 was correctly predicted (15.Mao C. Vig R. Venkatachalam T.K. Sudbeck E.A. Uckun F.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 2213-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16.Mao C. Sudbeck E.A. Venkatachalam T.K. Uckun F.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 1593-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Previously published resistance data for a PETT compound trovirdine (11.Zhang H. Vrang L. Backbro K. Lind P. Sahlberg C. Unge T. Oberg B. Antiviral Res. 1995; 28: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), show that mutations of Leu-100→Ile, Glu-138→Arg, and Tyr-188→His give 10–20-fold resistance when compared with wild-type HIV-1 RT. These three residues all make contacts with structural features of PETT-1 and PETT-2 that are also common to trovirdine. As outlined previously residues 100 and 188 make van der Waals contact with ring A. From modeling studies it is clear that these interactions would be disrupted by mutations to Ile and His, respectively. The side chain of Glu-138 from the p51 subunit forms contacts with ring A, which would be disrupted by the mutation to a bulkier side chain such as arginine. What are the particular features of a compound such as PETT-2 compared with most NNRTIs that allows it to bind to HIV-2 RT? One possibility we considered, given the significant amino acid sequence changes both within the NNRTI site and more generally, was whether PETT-2 could be binding at an entirely different site. The kinetic studies reported here attempt to address this question. The mode of inhibition experiments show that PETT-2 is noncompetitive with respect to dGTP for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RT, thus indicating it is not binding at the dNTP site (Table II). For the equivalent experiments with template primer and HIV-2 RT, the level of discrimination for the different inhibition models is not so marked, nevertheless noncompetitive inhibition is the preferred model in each experiment (Table II). For HIV-1 RT with template primer and PETT-2 varied there was a large discrimination against the competitive model, whereas mixed and uncompetitive modes were difficult to distinguish (Table II). Our data indicate that PETT-2 is neither competing for template primer nor for dNTP substrate sites on HIV-2 RT but are consistent with PETT-2 interacting at an HIV-2 equivalent of the HIV-1 NNRTI site. In considering this possibility and in attempting to explain the varying potency of PETT-1 and PETT-2, we examined both differences in the compounds and the sequence differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs, particularly in the region where the PETT B ring interacts. First we considered whether the pK a of the B ring pyridinyl nitrogen varied due to differing electron withdrawing/donating properties of nitrile and chlorine substituents, which could potentially modulate the hydrogen bonding capability to the main chain of Lys-101. In fact, the measured pK a of these nitrogens is very similar (4.25 and 4.32 for PETT-1 and PETT-2, respectively), and this means there will be minimal protonation of the pyridinyl nitrogen at physiological pH in either case. Hence, this cannot account for the different binding strength of the two compounds to HIV-2 RT. The nitrile group of PETT-1 makes van der Waals interactions with the main chain of Leu-234 and His-235 and with the side chain of Tyr-318. In HIV-2 RT, Leu-234 and Tyr-318 are conserved, but His-235 is replaced by a Trp residue. It is conceivable that the larger side chain of this Trp residue causes an alteration in the main chain position resulting in a slight reduction in the volume of the NNRTI site in this region, although still allowing accommodation of the smaller chlorine of PETT-2 but not the bulkier nitrile group of PETT-1. Certain members of the PETT series of NNRTIs may be better able to bind to HIV-2 RT due to a greater flexibility compared with the fused ring systems found in other NNRTIs such as nevirapine and TIBO. The linker region joining the two PETT pyridine rings could have enough flexibility to allow significant rearrangement and thereby be better accommodated within the HIV-2 RT “NNRTI” binding site. If this is the case then there are still clearly significant constraints on PETT binding to HIV-2 RT as exemplified by the effect of different B-ring substituents on potency of inhibition for this enzyme. To further define the binding of PETT-2 to HIV-2 RT in detail, a crystal structure of this complex will be required. Given the success of using NNRTIs to produce crystals of HIV-1 RT diffracting from medium to high resolution (6.Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, 30.Stammers D.K. Somers D.O.N. Ross C.K. Kirby I. Ray P.H. Wilson J.E. Norman M. Ren J.S. Esnouf R.M. Garman E.F. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 586-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), it is hoped that NNRTIs that bind to HIV-2 RT could provide a similar means for obtaining a high resolution structure of this latter enzyme. A high resolution HIV-2 RT structure might provide insights into ways of inhibiting widely variant RTs including different serotypes as well as drug-resistant forms. The rational design of potent non-nucleoside inhibitors with broad spectrum activity against a wide range of RTs should be of importance in the continued fight against AIDS.

The apoptosis enzyme, procaspase-3, contains an RGD-recognition sequence and is activated by RGDS. We examined the effects of RGDS and several GPIIb/IIIa antagonists on cell death and procaspase-3 activation in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. These antagonists do not recognize rat integrins, yet RGDS, orbofiban, and xemilofiban induced dose-dependent apoptosis and procaspase-3 activation in cardiomyocytes over 72 h, particularly under hypoxic conditions. Scrambled peptide, the monoclonal antibody 7E3 or integrelin (a peptide containing a KGD sequence), had little or no effect. Immunoprecipitation of procaspase-3 followed by treatment with the compounds showed that procaspase-3 was activated directly by RGDS, orbofiban, xemilofiban, and by monoclonal 7E3 antibody, the latter demonstrating that compounds must enter cells to induce apoptosis through caspase activation. Integrelin had no effect.

Binding studies with 3H-SC52012B, a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist analogue of orbofiban, showed no specific binding to cardiomyocytes, but the radioligand accumulated intracellularly over 72 h.3H-SC52012B also bound directly to human recombinant caspase-3 (K d, 59 ± 2 nm), and this was prevented by orbofiban, xemilofiban, and the monoclonal 7E3 antibody but not by integrelin. Finally confocal microscopy showed that RGDS co-localized with caspase-3 inside the cell. These data show that RGDS and its mimetics induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis by direct activation of procaspase-3. glycoprotein IIb/IIIa phosphate-buffered saline Hank's balanced salt solution monoclonal antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay human umbilical vein endothelial cells p-nitroaniline Integrins are cell surface molecules that are involved in cell adhesion to matrix proteins and other cells. Integrins are also capable of generating intracellular signals on engaging their ligands, including signals involved in cell growth and survival (1.Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 869-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2.Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar). Glycoprotein (GP)1 IIb/IIIa is largely confined to platelets and megakaryocytes, although it is also found on some melanoma cells (3.Boukerche H. Berthier V.O. Bailly M. Dore J.F. Leung L.L. McGregor J.L. Blood. 1989; 74: 909-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GPIIb/IIIa is required for normal platelet aggregation, an early event in the development of arterial thrombosis (4.Fuster V. Adams P.C. Badimon J.J. Chesebro J.H. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1987; 29: 325-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Several adhesion proteins bind to GPIIb/IIIa, but the principle ligand is fibrinogen (5.Plow E.F. Marguerie G. Ginsberg M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 4034-4040Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The interaction between fibrinogen and GPIIb/IIIa involves several regions of the ligand, including the motif RGD, two copies of which are found on each α-chain of fibrinogen (6.Liu Q. Matsueda G. Brown E. Frojmovic M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Several compounds have been designed, based on the RGD sequence, as antagonists of fibrinogen binding (7.Cox D. Aoki T. Seki J. Motoyama Y. Yoshida K. Med. Res. Rev. 1994; 14: 195-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8.Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arfsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1066-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GPIIb/IIIa antagonists prevent platelet aggregation and have been found to prevent coronary artery thrombosis, at least when given as short term infusions. Several members of the procaspase family of apoptosis genes, including procaspases-1, -2, -3, -7, and -8 also contain RGD motifs (9.Buckley C.D. Pilling D. Henriquez N.V. Parsonage G. Threlfall K. Scheel-Toellner D. Simmons D.L. Akbart A.N. Lord J.M. Salmon M. Nature. 1999; 397: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Two of these, procaspase-1 and -3, also contain potential RGD-binding motifs near to the experimentally determined processing sites necessary for activation to the mature caspase. Indeed, RGD-containing peptides are capable of inducing apoptosis in T-cells through direct procaspase-3 activation without any requirement for integrin enagement or modification of integrin-mediated cell signaling (9.Buckley C.D. Pilling D. Henriquez N.V. Parsonage G. Threlfall K. Scheel-Toellner D. Simmons D.L. Akbart A.N. Lord J.M. Salmon M. Nature. 1999; 397: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Potentially, RGD-containing peptides act by inducing conformational changes in the procaspase leading to increased oligomerization, a putative step in the activation of the enzyme (10.Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Similar activation of procaspase-3 in cardiomyocytes may explain the reported increase in cardiac death in patients on the oral GPIIb/IIIa antagonist, orbofiban. Moreover, such a mechanism may explain the proapoptotic properties of RGD peptides in models of angiogenesis, inflammation, and cancer metastasis (11.Humphries M.J. Olden K. Yamada K.M.

A. 1991; 88: 8072-8076Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-3 is a common ultimate signal in response to factors that induce apoptosis, such as Fas-induced apoptosis in several cell types (14.Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 also plays an important role in the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes rendered ischemic (15.Wang L. Ma W. Markovich R. Chen J.W. Wang P.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 activates a number of targets, including nuclear enzymes involved in DNA degradation (16.Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). We investigated if RGD peptides and RGD mimetics induced apoptosis through direct procaspase-3 activation in rat cardiomyocytes. The compounds studied were xemilofiban and orbofiban, designed to mimic the RGD motif (17.Zablocki J.A. Rico J.G. Garland R.B. Rogers T.E. Williams K. Schretzman L.A. Rao S.A. Bovy P.R. Tjoeng F.S.

We also examined the effects of the monoclonal anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody, abciximab, a chimeric mouse/human F(ab) of 7E3, which binds to the ligand binding site of GPIIb/IIIa (18.Coller B.S. Folts J.D. Smith S.R. Scudder L.E. Jordan R. Circulation. 1989; 80: 1766-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of the peptide RGDS and a cyclic peptide, integrelin, which contains a KGD rather than an RGD sequence that is thought to improve its specificity for GPIIb/IIIa (8.Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arfsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1066-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were prepared by a modification of the method originally described by Simpson and Savion (31.Simpson P. Savion S. Circ. Res. 1982; 50: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hearts from 1–3-day-old Wistar rats were minced and dissociated with approximately 80 units/ml type II collagenase and 0.06% pancreatin. Cardiomyocytes were separated from other cell types by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Dispersed cells were incubated in 25-cm2flasks for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Nonattached, viable cells were collected and seeded into fresh flasks at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/ml. To obtain a near pure cardiomyocyte preparation, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Hams F-12 supplemented with 1.2 g/liter sodium hydrogen carbonate, 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum containing 1 mm pyruvic acid, 1 μg/ml transferrin, 10 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml sodium selenite, 250 μm vitamin C, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Using a monoclonal anti-α-actinin sarcomeric antibody we found 96–98% of our cells were cardiomyocytes (not shown). Medium was replaced with medium containing no newborn calf serum at 48 h. The cells were incubated for 24 h before the addition of the test compounds. Amino-terminal biotinylated peptides, b-GRGDSP and b-GRGDNP, were purified by high performance liquid chromatography (by manufacturer) and were >95% pure. Streptavidin-coated Dynabeads (M-280, 2.8 μm diameter, Dynal) were coated with biotinylated peptides according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, the Dynabeads were resuspended by vortexing for 2 min, and the required volume was pipetted into a suitable tube, which was placed in the Dynal magnetic protein purification holder and allowed settle for 2 min. The supernatant was removed carefully, and the beads were resuspended in PBS. This procedure was repeated three times. After the third wash, the beads were resuspended in the appropriate volume of PBS for coating of the beads with the biotinylated peptides. The appropriate amount of biotinylated peptides (1 μg of peptide to 107 beads) was added to washed Dynabeads and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with unidirectional mixing. The beads were collected by placing the sample tube in the Dynal magnetic protein purification holder for 2 min. The supernatant was removed, and the beads were resuspended in PBS. The washing procedure was repeated six times. The beads were then added to cells at the required concentration. On day 4 following isolation, medium from cardiomyocytes grown in each 25-cm2 flask was replaced with fresh medium, 18 flasks in triplicate were used over 24–72 h each containing vehicle or compound (GRGDSP-scrambled peptide, GRGDSP on beads, RGDS peptide, 7E3, integrelin, orbofiban, or xemilofiban). In additional experiments, we examined the compounds on cardiomyocytes rendered hypoxic. On day 4 following isolation, medium from cardiomyocytes grown in each 25-cm2 flask was replaced with fresh medium, and the compounds were added as above. The cells were then placed in a hypoxic incubator in an atmosphere of 94% nitrogen, 5% CO2, and 1% O2 for 48 h. Caspase-3 activity was then measured as described below. HUVEC were isolated as has been described previously (20.Jaff E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker L.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5967) Google Scholar). On day 2 following isolation, medium from HUVECs grown in 25-cm2 flask was replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were exposed to orbofiban for 72 h. Caspase-3 activity was measured in these cells as described below. Apoptosis was measured by quantitating the fragmentation of DNA in the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells. The cell lysate was placed into a streptavidin-coated microtitre plate. Subsequently, a mixture of anti-histone-biotin and anti-DNA-POD antibodies was added and incubated for 2 h. During the incubation period, the anti-histone antibody binds to the histone component of the nucleosomes and simultaneously fixes the immunocomplex to the streptavidin-coated microtitre plate. Additionally, the anti-DNA-peroxidase antibody reacts with the DNA component of the nucleosomes. After removal of unbound antibodies by a washing step, the amount of nucleosomes was quantified by the peroxidase retained in the immunocomplex. Peroxidase activity was determined photometrically with ABTS (z,z′-azino-di[3-ethylbenzthiazolin-sulfonat]) as a substrate. A positive control was provided in the assay. Another assay was used to measure apoptosis by quantitating the fragmentation of 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine-labeled DNA in apoptotic cells. The assay, a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), uses two mouse monoclonal antibodies, one directed against DNA and the other against 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine. Cardiomyocytes were incubated with the nonradioactive thymidine analogue 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine, which is incorporated into the genomic DNA. 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine fragments are released from the cells into the cell cytoplasm during apoptosis. The colorimetric substrate (Ac-DEVD-pNA) was labeled with the chromophorep-nitroaniline (pNA). pNA is released from the substrate upon cleavage by DEVDase (caspase-3). Free pNA produces a yellow color that was monitored by a photometer at 405 nm. The potent, irreversible, and cell-permeable pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fluoromethylketone was added directly to cells as a control. The difference between the amount of pNA produced in the absence of inhibitor and in the presence of inhibitor is largely a measure of caspase-3 and caspase-7 activity. In order to measure caspase-3 specific activity, cells were also treated with a caspase-3-specific inhibitor, Ac-DMOD-CHO. The difference between the amount of pNA released in the presence and absence of caspase-3 inhibitor minus the pNA released in the presence of the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK was determined as a measure of caspase-3 activity. A pNA calibration curve was plotted from a pNA stock solution provided, and caspase-3 activity in the samples was measured relative to this curve. The caspase-3-specific activity was calculated as follows, ΔA=AA−As−ANEquation 1 where AA = mean-induced apoptosis sampleA 405−mean blank A 405,As = mean negative control caspase-3 specific inhibitor sample A 405−mean blan kA 405, and AN = mean negative control pan inhibitor sample A 405−mean blank A 405. The activity (X) of caspase-3 present in each sample was calculated using the following formula. X=pmol of pNA liberated/h in the absence of inhibitor−ΔA−(y intercept of pNA curve)incubation time in hEquation 2 ×(slope of pNA standard curve) −1 The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (21.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248Crossref PubMed Scopus (211906) Google Scholar). The specific activity of (SA) caspase-3 in the cell extract was calculated as follows. SA=pmol liberated/h at 37°C/μg of proteinEquation 3 Following the treatment of cardiomyocytes with RGDS-containing peptides and GPIIb/IIIa antagonists over 72 h, caspase-3 expression and activation was also measured directly by Western blot where the active caspase-3 was detected as its cleaved mature form using a polyclonal rabbit anti-caspase-3 antibody. In brief, for Western blot studies, whole cell lysates were prepared with Triton X-100 buffer containing protease inhibitors. After adjustment for protein concentration, cell lysates were boiled in Laemmli buffer and resolved on 8–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before Western blot analysis with an antibody against caspase-3. Procaspase-3 was purified by immunoprecipitation from lysates of cardiomyocytes in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1% Triton X-100 with 20 μm caspase-3 selective inhibitor Ac-DMOD-CHO. Extracts were incubated with anti-caspase-3 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by addition the of protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitated material was washed three times in lysis buffer. The beads were resuspended in 1 ml of caspase buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated with 1 mmpeptide (GRGDSP or GRADSP) or GPIIb/IIIa antagonists; 10 μg/ml monoclonal 7E3 antibody, 10 μm integrelin, 10 μm orbofiban and 10 μm xemilofiban, for 20 min at 30 °C. At the end of the incubation an equal volume of Laemmli buffer was added, and the samples were boiled and resolved on 8–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before Western blot analysis with an antibody against procaspase-3 and cleaved fragments. For the competition binding assay, cardiomyocytes were incubated with:3H-SC52012B for 30 min, 3H-SC52012B with excess SC52012B for 30 min, 3H-SC52012B for 72 h,3H-SC52012B with excess SC52012B for 72 h, or3H-SC52012B for 72 h followed by the addition of excess SC52012B over the last 30 min. These cells were washed with PBS three times and either scraped into 1 ml of Hanks/Hepes solution containing 1 mm CaCl2 (HBSS) or lysed directly in 50 μl of 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer on ice for 30 min. Cells in HBSS and lysis buffer were spun at 10,000 rpm in a bench top centrifuge. The cell pellet of the cardiomyocytes in HBSS was resuspended in 50 μl of HBSS. The supernatant of the lysed cardiomyocytes was removed to a clean Eppendorff on ice. The cell pellet suspension in 50 μl of HBSS was passed immediately through a cell separator with a Whatman GF/C filter to collect cell membranes. The filters were added to scintillation fluid and analyzed by scintillation counter (Wallac 1214 Rackbeta, Turku, Finland) The lysed supernatant was added directly to 5 ml of scintillation fluid and similarly analyzed. The results were plotted as counts/minute averaged over three flasks. To measure specific binding of 3H-SC52012B to human recombinant caspase-3, 2 μg of caspase-3 or a control milk protein were incubated with the 20 nm3H-SC52012B or 20 nm3H-SC52012B in the presence of 10 μmunlabeled SC52012B or the GPIIb/IIIa antagonists orbofiban, monoclonal antibody 7E3, mAb2, or integrelin for 16 h at 4 °C, followed by treatment with activated charcoal to remove free radioligand. The supernatant was then counted directly. The results were plotted as counts/min averaged over three flasks. 1 μg of human recombinant caspase-3 was incubated with increasing concentrations (6.25–1000 nm) of3H-SC52021B in the presence and absence of excess 10 μm SC-52021B for 16 h at 4 °C followed by treatment with activated charcoal to remove free radioligand. The supernatant was then counted directly. The specific activity (∼50%) was calculated for each concentration of 3H-SC52021B (6.25–1000 nm), and the K d andB max values were calculated by standard saturation binding curves and Scathchard plots. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of biotinylated peptides (GRADSP or GRGDSP) at 1 mm for 48 h. Cells were then washed in warmed PBS, scraped into 1 ml of PBS, and cytospun onto glass slides. Cells were washed and fixed by incubation with ice-cold methanol for 7 min followed by incubation with ice-cold acetone for 2 min. Cells were then washed in PBS for 5 min before being treated with goat serum blocking buffer for 1 h followed by treatment with rabbit-anti-rat-caspase-3 antibody at a dilution of 1/1000 for 1 h. After 1 h, cells were washed in Tris-buffered saline (3 × 5 min) and then treated with secondary goat-anti-rabbit antibody that was conjugated with a flourescent Texas Red dye for 15 min. This step was followed by a washing step in PBS (3 × 5 min) followed by staining of the biotinylated peptides in cells with streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate for 10 min. This dual-staining method allowed us to see specific binding of the biotinylated peptides to caspase-3 inside the cell. Cells were photographed using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510, Axioplan 2). Pictures obtained were magnified at 40 × 10 or 63 × 10. All quantitative data are expressed as mean ± S.E. The data were analyzed by parametric unpaired Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RGDS showed a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis of cardiomyocytes over 24–72 h (Figs. 1 and2) measured by either assay of DNA fragmentation, with a corresponding increase in procaspase-3 activation (Figs. 1 and 2), whereas a scrambled peptide had no effect. No increase in apoptosis was seen when RGDS was first bound to beads. The GPIIb/IIIa antagonists orbofiban and xemilofiban also caused apoptosis and procaspase-3 activation in cardiomyocytes with a similar time course (Fig. 1). In contrast, the monoclonal antibody 7E3 and the KGD-containing cyclic peptide, integrelin, did not cause apoptosis in the cardiomyocytes, although some procaspase-3 activation was observed at the highest concentration of integrelin after 72 h. In contrast to cardiomyocytes, orbofiban induced only a small degree of procaspase-3 activation in HUVEC and only at a very high concentration (not shown). Caspase-3 activation was also shown in cardiomyocytes by Western blot (Fig. 3 A) detection of the cleaved caspase-3 p20 fragment following treatment with RGDS, orbofiban, and xemilofiban over 72 h. RGDS bound to beads; integrelin and the monoclonal antibody 7E3 did not cause activation of caspase-3. Direct caspase-3 activation was shown by immunoprecipitation of procaspase-3 from cardiomyocytes followed by treatment with the compounds (Fig. 3 B). RGDS, orbofiban, and xemilofiban caused direct activation of caspase-3 measured by Western blot. Interestingly the p20-cleaved fragment was also detected in the monoclonal antibody 7E3-treated protein, suggesting that this compound must enter the cell to cause activation of procaspase-3. Neither RGDS bound to beads nor integrelin caused direct activation of caspase-3.Figure 2RGDS and GPIIb/IIIa antagonists cause a time-dependent increase in apoptosis and procaspase-3 activation in primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes over 24–72 h,n = 3.

After 72 h, however, there was a marked increase in binding confined largely to the cytosolic fraction and not the membrane fraction. The cytosolic labeled ligand was competed off by unlabeled SC-5021B added at the start of the 72-h incubation and not when added for the last 30 min, consistent with a gradual uptake of the labeled compound over the period of incubation. 3H-SC52021B bound to human recombinant caspase-3 with a K d of 59 ± 2 nmand a B max of 324 ± 32 fmol/μg of protein, (n = 3). 3H-SC52021B binding to human caspase-3 (Fig. 5) was competed by unlabeled SC-52021B, orbofiban, xemilofiban, and by the monoclonal 7E3 antibody. In contrast, integrelin did not compete for binding. Similarly mAb2, a murine GPIIb/IIIa monoclonal antibody that does not bind to the ligand binding site, had no effect on3H-SC52021B binding to caspase-3. As a control experiment, we measured the binding of 3H-SC52021B to milk protein under the same conditions and examined the effects of the compounds.3H-SC52021B bound nonspecifically to this protein in that neither unlabeled SC-52021B nor the other GPIIb/IIIa antagonists inhibited binding.

Hypoxia (1% O2) caused a significant increase in apoptosis and procaspase-3 activity in cardiomyocytes after 48 h (Fig. 7).

https://openalex.org/W1972679607,"Aromatic amino acids are important components of the ligand binding site in the Cys loop family of ligand-gated ion channels. To examine the role of tryptophan residues in the ligand binding domain of the 5-hydroxytryptamine3(5-HT3) receptor, we used site-directed mutagenesis to change each of the eight N-terminal tryptophan residues in the 5-HT3A receptor subunit to tyrosine or serine. The mutants were expressed as homomeric 5-HT3A receptors in HEK293 cells and analyzed with radioligand binding, electrophysiology, and immunocytochemistry. Mutation of Trp90, Trp183, and Trp195 to tyrosine resulted in functional receptors, although with increased EC50 values (2–92-fold) to 5-HT3 receptor agonists. Changing these residues to serine either ablated function (Trp90 and Trp183) or resulted in a further increase in EC50(Trp195). Mutation of residue Trp60 had no effect on ligand binding or receptor function, whereas mutation of Trp95, Trp102, Trp121, and Trp214 ablated ligand binding and receptor function, and all but one of the receptors containing these mutations were not expressed at the plasma membrane. We propose that Trp90, Trp183, and Trp195 are intimately involved in ligand binding, whereas Trp95, Trp102, Trp121, and Trp214 have a critical role in receptor structure or assembly. Aromatic amino acids are important components of the ligand binding site in the Cys loop family of ligand-gated ion channels. To examine the role of tryptophan residues in the ligand binding domain of the 5-hydroxytryptamine3(5-HT3) receptor, we used site-directed mutagenesis to change each of the eight N-terminal tryptophan residues in the 5-HT3A receptor subunit to tyrosine or serine. The mutants were expressed as homomeric 5-HT3A receptors in HEK293 cells and analyzed with radioligand binding, electrophysiology, and immunocytochemistry. Mutation of Trp90, Trp183, and Trp195 to tyrosine resulted in functional receptors, although with increased EC50 values (2–92-fold) to 5-HT3 receptor agonists. Changing these residues to serine either ablated function (Trp90 and Trp183) or resulted in a further increase in EC50(Trp195). Mutation of residue Trp60 had no effect on ligand binding or receptor function, whereas mutation of Trp95, Trp102, Trp121, and Trp214 ablated ligand binding and receptor function, and all but one of the receptors containing these mutations were not expressed at the plasma membrane. We propose that Trp90, Trp183, and Trp195 are intimately involved in ligand binding, whereas Trp95, Trp102, Trp121, and Trp214 have a critical role in receptor structure or assembly. 5-hydroxytryptamine3 nicotinic acetylcholine γ-aminobutyric acid wild type meta-chlorophenylbiguanide ligand-gated ion channel The 5-HT31receptor is a member of the Cys loop family of ligand-gated ion channels, which includes nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glycine receptors. The predicted 5-HT3 receptor subunit structure shows the expected characteristics of a nACh receptor-type subunit, including a large extracellular N-terminal region, and four putative transmembrane domains (TM1–TM4) with a bulky intracellular loop between TM3 and TM4. 5-HT3A receptor subunits have been cloned from mouse, rat, human, and guinea pig (1.Maricq A.V.

The nACh receptor is the receptor most closely related to the 5-HT3 receptor with up to 30% amino acid sequence identity (5.Uetz P. Abdelatty F. Villaroel A. Rappold G. Weiss B. Koenen M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Evidence from biochemical and mutagenesis studies on nACh receptors indicate that the ligand binding site is located in discontiguous regions of the extracellular N-terminal domain, and this has been further confirmed by the construction of a chimeric protein consisting of the N-terminal domain of the α7 neuronal nACh receptor subunit linked to the C-terminal portion of the 5-HT3Areceptor subunit, which showed nACh receptor pharmacological properties and 5-HT3 receptor channel properties (11.Eisele J.-L.

Labeling and mutagenesis studies have identified a number of N-terminal amino acids in nACh subunits that are probably involved in ligand binding; these are mostly aromatic amino acids and include Trpα54, Trpα86, Tyrα93, Trpα149, Trpα187, Tyrα190, Cysα192, Cysα193, and Tyrα198 (12.Karlin A.

Sequence alignments between the nACh and 5-HT3 receptors show that some of the tryptophan residues are conserved in both classes of receptor. These include nACh Trpα54, Trpα86, and Trpα149, which align to residues Trp90, Trp121, and Trp183in the 5-HT3A receptor subunit. Biochemical evidence also indicates that tryptophan residues are involved in 5-HT3receptor ligand binding; modifying these residues with N-bromosuccinimide inhibits radiolabeled antagonist binding to the 5-HT3 receptor in a ligand-protectable manner (26.Miquel M.C. Emerit M.B. Gozlan H. Hamon M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1453-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To examine the role of tryptophan residues in the N-terminal ligand binding domain of the 5-HT3A receptor, we have changed the eight tryptophans in this region (Fig. 1) using site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting mutants have been expressed in HEK293 cells and characterized with radioligand binding, electrophysiology, and immunocytochemistry. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were cultured on 90-mm tissue culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium/F-12 medium (1:1) medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) at 37 °C and 7% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. HEK293 cells stably expressing 5-HT3A receptors were developed using the eukaryotic expression vector pRc/CMV (In Vitrogen, Abingdon, UK) containing the complete coding sequence for the 5-HT3A(b) subunit from NIE-115 cells as described previously (27.Hargreaves A.C. Gunthorpe M.J. Taylor C.W. Lummis S.C.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1284-1294PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis reactions were performed using the Kunkel method (28.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. For transient transfections, HEK cells at 60–70% confluency (∼48 h post passage) were transfected with WT or mutant plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (29.Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For radioligand binding studies cells were grown on 90-mm plates (Falcon) and harvested 3 days after transfection. For electrophysiology experiments cells were grown on 35-mm plates, and recordings were performed 1–4 days post-transfection. In immunofluorescence experiments cells were grown on 22-mm diameter glass coverslips in 35-mm plates and stained 3 days post-transfection. Transfected HEK293 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature: all subsequent steps were carried out at 1–4 °C. Cells were scraped into 1 ml of HEPES buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) containing the following proteinase inhibitors: 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 50 μg/ml bacitracin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Harvested cells were washed in HEPES with proteinase inhibitors and frozen at −20 °C. After thawing, they were washed twice with HEPES buffer and resuspended, and 50 μg of cell membranes were incubated in 0.5 ml of HEPES buffer containing [3H]granisetron (81 Ci/mmol, DuPont) ranging in concentration from 0.05 to 40 nm, or [3H]meta-chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG; 26 Ci/mmol, DuPont) ranging in concentration from 0.05 to 20 nm. 100 nm unlabeled granisetron or 1 μmd-tubocurarine was used to determine nonspecific binding. Antagonist reactions were incubated for 1 h and agonist reactions were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and were terminated by rapid vacuum filtration using a Brandel cell harvester onto GF/B filters presoaked for 3 h in 0.3% polyethyleneimine followed by two rapid washes with 4 ml of ice-cold HEPES buffer. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (Beckman LS6000sc). Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay with bovine serum albumin standards. Data were analyzed by iterative curve fitting (GraphPad, PRISM, San Diego, CA) according to the equation: B = (Bmax [L] n)/([L] n +K n), where B is bound radioligand,Bmax is maximum binding at equilibrium,K is the equilibrium dissociation constant, [L] is the free concentration of radioligand, and n is the Hill coefficient. Transfected cells were washed with 3 changes of Tris-buffered saline (0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl) and fixed using ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (66 mm Na2HPO4, 38 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.2). To label the N-terminal domain, pAb120 antiserum (30.Spier A.D. Wotherspoon G. Nayak S.V. Nichols R.A. Priestley J.V. Lummis S.C.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was used at 1:300 dilution in Tris-buffered saline. Intracellular receptor expression was determined by inclusion of 0.3% Triton X-100 for membrane permeabilization. Primary antibody incubation was for 1 h at room temperature. Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector) and fluorescein isothiocyanate avidin D (Vector) were used to detect bound antibody as per the manufacturer's instructions. Coverslips were mounted in vectashield mounting medium (Vector), and immunofluorescence was observed using a Nikon optiphot microscope. Membrane currents from single cells were recorded by whole cell patch clamp using an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Darmstadt, Germany) controlled by Pulse software (HEKA). Patch electrodes were made from filamented glass capillary tubing (Clark Electromedical) and were back-filled with filtered (0.2 μm, Millipore) electrode solution (140 mmCsCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, to pH 7.2 with CsOH). Electrodes with resistances of 2–4 MΩ were used for recordings. Series resistance was less than 10 MΩ. Cells were voltage clamped at −60 mV in all experiments, and drugs were applied via a U-tube delivery system capable of a complete change of solution within 100 ms (31.Sepulveda M.-I. Lummis S.C.R. Martin I.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 104: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Data acquisition, monitoring, storage, and analysis were performed using HEKA software. During recordings the dishes were continuously perfused (3–5 ml/min) at room temperature in bath solution (130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 30 mm glucose, pH 7.2 with NaOH). Drug applications were followed by a minimum 3-min wash period. Dose-response curves were fitted to the equation: I =Imax/(1 + (EC50/[L]) n) using Kaleidagraph (Abelbeck Software), where I is the current at a given agonist concentration, Imax is the maximal current, EC50 is the agonist concentration that elicits half-maximal current, and n is the Hill coefficient. All cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, UK) except fetal calf serum, which was from Sigma (Poole, UK). 5-HT hydrochloride was from Research Biochemicals Inc. (St. Albans, UK), and mCPBG and 2-methyl-5-HT (2-Me-5-HT) were from Tocris Chemicals (Bristol, UK). [3H]Granisetron (81 Ci/mmol) and mCPBG (26 Ci/mmol) were from DuPont. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Radioligand binding studies using membranes from WT-transfected HEK293 cells revealed that [3H]granisetron and [3H]mCPBG label a homogeneous population of binding sites with high affinity;K d = 0.17 ± 0.03 nm and 1.48 ± 0.09 nm respectively (n = 3). Hill coefficients were not significantly different to unity. There was no difference in radioligand binding parameters for either [3H]granisetron or [3H]mCPBG because of modification of the 5-HT3 receptor W60 to serine (TableI). Whole cell patch clamp revealed that 5-HT and the 5-HT3 receptor agonist mCPBG elicited rapid transient inward currents from cells transfected with WT DNA (Fig. 2). From concentration-effect curves EC50s were 2.10 ± 0.40 μm and 0.81 ± 0.09 μm for 5-HT and mCPBG respectively. The EC50 and nH values for W60S 5-HT3 receptor constructs were not significantly different to WT (Table II).Table IEffect of tryptophan mutations on 5-HT3 receptor radioligand bindingReceptor[3H]Granisetron[3H]mCPBGK dn HK dn HnmnmWild type0.17 ± 0.0031.03 ± .0111.48 ± 0.091.07 ± 0.02W60S0.21 ± 0.050.84 ± 0.151.31 ± 0.130.90 ± 0.06W90Y0.92 ± 0.06aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).0.92 ± 0.038.24 ± 0.73aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).1.00 ± 0.003W90SNDbND, not detected.NDNDNDW183YNDNDNDNDW183SNDNDNDNDW195Y8.7 ± 2.4aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).1.24 ± 0.182.66 ± 0.620.84 ± 0.22W195S1.35 ± 0.07aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).1.37 ± 0.142.47 ± 0.280.72 ± 0.17Values are the means ± S.E.

Using membranes prepared from W90Y-transfected HEK293 cells, a 5.4-fold increase in K d for [3H]granisetron was observed compared with WT; the Hill coefficient was not significantly changed. The change in antagonist affinity was reflected by a similar change in agonist affinity: K d for [3H]mCPBG increased 5.6-fold, with no effect on the Hill coefficient. Binding of both radioligands was ablated by the mutations W90S, W183Y, and W183S. W195Y and W195S mutations did not effect the [3H]mCPBG binding affinity but significantly increased the K d for [3H]granisetron binding; these latter increases were not significantly different between the two mutants (Table I). The EC50 values for the W90Y mutant, stably transfected into HEK293 cells, were increased 3.8- and 2.5-fold as compared with WT for 5-HT and mCPBG, respectively (Fig.3), whereas the EC50 for the partial agonist 2-Me-5-HT was not altered; EC50 values were 12.7 ± 0.45 μm and 12.9 ± 1.98 μm for WT and W90Y, respectively (n = 3). The Hill coefficients for all three agonists were not significantly changed by the W90Y mutation. The mutant W90S, when expressed in HEK293 cells, did not show any response to 5-HT3 (≤1 mm) or mCPBG (≤500 μm). The electrophysiological properties of W183Y, W183S, W195Y, and W195S mutants were also examined in transfected HEK293 cells. For the W183Y mutation, EC50 values for 5-HT and mCPBG were increased 92- and 24-fold, respectively, compared with WT, whereas there was no response to application of either agonist for the W183S mutation. The W195Y mutation resulted in 3.9- and 2.1-fold increases in EC50 for 5-HT and mCPBG, respectively, whereas the W195S mutation caused 9.0- and 2.7-fold increases in EC50, respectively. The Hill coefficients were not affected by W183Y, W195Y, or W195S mutations for either agonist (Table II). The time course of desensitization for these mutants was slower than WT (Fig.2), suggesting that the mutations had resulted in changes to the rate constants between the open and desensitized states of the receptor, perhaps indicating decreased stability of the desensitized state in the mutant receptors. Changes in stability of the different states of the receptor are likely to affect the equilibrium binding data, which depends on the interplay between these different states at equilibrium; this interplay will differ in the presence of agonists, where desensitization is obligatory, and antagonists, which may bind preferentially to either the closed or desensitized state. Thus, if our hypothesis is correct, the change in affinity that we observed for antagonist but not agonist binding in the Trp195 mutants suggests that in these receptors granisetron, an antagonist, may have a stronger preference than mCPBG for the desensitized state of the receptor. Single point binding assays were carried out with [3H]granisetron and [3H]mCPBG at WTK d (0.2 and 1 nm, respectively) and WT saturation (10 and 20 nm, respectively) concentrations, for each mutant transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Simultaneous transfection of the WT 5-HT3A receptor subunit resulted in high levels of specific ligand binding for both radioligands. However, membranes transfected with the mutant receptors showed no specific binding with either ligand. Furthermore, none of the mutants W95Y, W95S, W102Y, W102S, W121Y, W121S, W214Y, and W214S, when transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, showed electrophysiological responses to ≤1 mm 5-HT. Receptors that give rise to agonist-induced currents in transfected HEK293 cells are clearly expressed at the plasma membrane. To determine whether mutants that did not respond to agonist or demonstrate detectable radioligand binding are correctly oligomerized and expressed at the plasma membrane, the localization of nonfunctional mutant subunits was studied using a 5-HT3A receptor N-terminal specific antibody, pAb120 (30.Spier A.D. Wotherspoon G. Nayak S.V. Nichols R.A. Priestley J.V. Lummis S.C.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic 5-HT3 receptor-specific staining was observed in cells with permeabilized membranes expressing WT and all mutant constructs tested (Figs. 4 and5). pAb120 immunolabeled cells, transfected with WT, functional mutants (data not shown) and nonfunctional mutants W90S, W183S, and W214Y with nonpermeabilized membranes, acquired a characteristic narrow ring of pAb120 labeling around the membrane. This strong fluorescent signal from the membrane was not observed in cells that did not express receptor or cells that expressed any of the other nonfunctional mutant constructs. The fluorescence in the membrane was granular in appearance, possibly corresponding to aggregations of receptors in the membrane.Figure 5Immunolocalization of wild type and nonfunctional membrane-expressed mutant 5-HT3 receptors. Mutant receptors were expressed in transiently transfected HEK293 cells and identified using the anti-5-HT3 receptor N terminus antiserum, pAb120. Cell membranes were either Triton X-100 permeabilized or nonpermeabilized (as labeled). Note the plasma membrane localization of WT and mutant W90S and W183S in the nonpermeabilized preparations.

The pharmacology, electrophysiology, and localization of the altered receptors were examined using the HEK293 cell expression system. The data we have presented suggest that three of the tryptophan residues, Trp90, Trp183, and Trp195, play a role in ligand binding, whereas the four residues Trp95, Trp102, Trp121, and Trp214 are critical for the correct receptor assembly and/or structure. The nonconservative substitution of Trp60 for serine results in mutant receptors that have radioligand binding and electrophysiological properties not discernible from the WT receptor, suggesting that Trp60 does not play a role in ligand binding and appears to have little or no structural significance. Alignments of the 5-HT3, nACh, GABAA, and glycine receptors (Fig. 6) show that Trp60 of the 5-HT3A receptor subunit does not align with tryptophanyl, aromatic, or ligand binding residues from any other members of the nACh-type LGIC family. These findings suggest that Trp60 is not an important residue for either the structure or the function of the 5-HT3 receptor. The effects of mutation at these positions to tyrosine and serine were indistinguishable from each other. All six substitutions resulted in receptors that did not bind [3H]granisetron or [3H]mCPBG, did not respond to 5-HT, and were not expressed at the plasma membrane, although high levels of intracellular protein expression were observed for all of the mutant receptors (Fig.5). These observations are consistent with subunits not assembling or assembling incorrectly or fully assembled pentamers not being sorted to the plasma membrane. The importance of hydrophobic amino acids in the N-terminal domain for mediating subunit interactions in receptor assembly has been demonstrated in the glycine (32.Kuhse J. Laube B. Magalei D. Betz H. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1049-1056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and nACh (33.Chavez R.A. Maloof J. Beeson D. Newsom-Davis J. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23028-23034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) receptors, and it is likely that in the 5-HT3 receptor, Trp95, Trp102, and Trp121 are similarly critical for correct assembly. An alternative explanation is that Trp95, Trp102, and Trp121 may be important for the determination of the tertiary structure of the 5-HT3receptor. Indeed both explanations may be correct because one or more of these residues may in fact modify the tertiary structure so that it prevents correct subunit-subunit interactions. Trp95 and Trp121 are strictly conserved in all binding and nonbinding nACh, GABAA, and glycine receptor subunits, whereas Trp102 residue is conserved in most nACh subunits and is otherwise represented as an aromatic residue in the other subunits of this receptor family (Fig. 6). These canonical residues may therefore create an N-terminal domain backbone structure that is common to all of the LGICs in this family (17.Galzi J.-L. Changeux J.-P. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Biophys. 1992; 25: 395-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The mutation W214Y resulted in a receptor which was expressed at the plasma membrane but did not bind radiolabeled granisetron or mCPBG and did not respond to 5-HT in electrophysiological assays. The effect of the W214S mutation was more severe, resulting in no binding, function, or expression at the plasma membrane. These data suggest that an aromatic residue is necessary at position 214 for correct receptor expression but is not sufficient to retain function. A tryptophan residue at an equivalent position to Trp214 is conserved in all binding and nonbinding subunits of the nACh receptor (Fig. 6), although aromatic amino acids are not present at the homologous position in either of the anionic receptors. This tryptophan residue may therefore be an important determinant of the tertiary structure of the N-terminal domain of cationic, but not anionic, channels. The W90Y mutation resulted in a receptor with decreased radioligand binding affinities and agonist responses, whereas the replacement of tryptophan with serine caused radioligand binding and agonist responses to be abolished without affecting receptor expression at the plasma membrane. In the W90Y mutant, the similar increase in mCPBG EC50 (agonist binding receptor in the resting, activable state) and K d(agonist binding receptor in the desensitized state) suggests that the effects of this mutation may be due to a binding site modification rather than an effect on the mechanisms of channel gating. Furthermore, Hill coefficients for radioligand binding and electrophysiological experiments were not altered by the W90Y mutation. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the W90Y mutation did not change the EC50 for the partial 5-HT3 receptor agonist 2-Me-5-HT, and these data also suggest that 2-Me-5-HT binds to the receptor via interactions different from those of the full agonists, 5-HT and mCPBG. The observation that W90S mutant receptors reach the plasma membrane but do not bind ligands suggests that an aromatic group at this position is essential for ligand binding, either because of its interaction with the ligand or for the formation of the correct structure of the ligand binding pocket. All 5-HT3 receptor ligands possess an aromatic ring containing a polar group, and a basic nitrogen atom (36.Gozlan H. Langlois M. Hamon M. Central and Peripheral 5 - HT3 receptors. Academic Press, London1992: 60-88Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with a direct interaction of 5-HT3 receptor ligands with Trp90, and we suggest this is via cation π interactions between the aromatic tryptophan and the basic nitrogen present in 5-HT3 ligands, similar to the ligand binding mechanisms postulated for the binding of the quaternary ammonium ion of ACh to aromatic residues of the nAChR (37.Dougherty D.A. Stauffer D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1558-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 38.Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar). This hypothesis explains the reduction in affinity for ligands caused by the W90Y mutation, because the indole of tryptophan provides a larger and more intense region of negative electrostatic potential than a simple benzene ring, making tryptophan a more attractive cation binding site than tyrosine. The ablation of ligand binding by replacement of Trp90 with serine is consistent with this hypothesis, because it would result in the complete removal of this putative cation binding site. Other possible ligand stabilization mechanisms that could explain our data include dispersion, i.e. a mutual synchronization of fluctuating charge in the overlapping indole rings, or a dipole-induced dipole interaction between the polar group of the ligand and the indole of the tryptophan. Both of these interactions would be weaker than the cation π bond that we propose and are therefore probably less likely, although further experimentation and/or determination of the three-dimensional structure of the binding site is required to confirm or disprove our hypothesis. A recent study also supports a role for Trp90 in ligand binding and further uses alanine scanning mutagenesis to provide evidence that this region may be in a β-strand conformation (39.Yan D. Schulte M.K. Bloom K.E. White M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5537-5541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Trp90 aligns with the nAChR α7 Trp54, which is proposed to form a complimentary component of the ligand binding site, i.e. contributed by an adjacent subunit (24.Corringer P.-J. Galzi J.-L. Eisele J.-L. Bertrand S. Changeux J.-P. Bertrand D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11749-11752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). α7 Trp54 is highly conserved in nACh subunits that are expected to contribute a complimentary ligand binding loop, although it is also conserved in many of the neuronal α subunits (Fig. 6). An aromatic residue, phenylalanine, occupies this position in GABA and glycine receptor subunits, and in the former has been shown to contribute to the binding site for GABA (40.Sigel E. Baur R. Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 41.Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Thus the data presented for the 5-HT3A Trp90 residue extend the identified structural and functional homologies between the receptors of this LGIC superfamily in addition to their considerable sequence homologies. Mutation of Trp183 to tyrosine caused a large increase in agonist EC50 values and abolished radioligand binding, whereas the W183S mutant had no apparent ligand binding or function but was expressed at the plasma membrane. The cooperative nature of ligand binding was unaffected by the W183Y mutation, suggesting that its effects are unlikely to be manifest via a structural change in the receptor. Thus residue Trp183appears to be involved in ligand binding, probably via cation π interactions as postulated above for the Trp90residue. The tryptophan at position 183 of the 5-HT3A receptor subunit aligns with trytophan residues in nACh α and β (except muscle type) subunits but is not conserved in the 5-HT3Breceptor subunit nor in the nonbinding nACh subunits γ, δ, and ε. Trp183 of the 5-HT3A receptor subunit aligns with phenylalanine residues in the glycine receptor and tyrosines in the GABAA receptor (Fig. 6). These latter aromatic residues have been implicated in ligand binding for the nACh (14.Dennis M. Giraudat J. Kotzyba-Hibert F. Goeldner M. Hirth C. Chang J.-Y. Lazure C. Chretien M. Changeux J.-P.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), GABAA (42.Amin J. Weiss D.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), and glycine receptors (43.Schmieden V. Kuhse J. Betz H. Science. 1993; 262: 256-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus 5-HT3A receptor subunit Trp183 and its homologues are the first residues that have been demonstrated to be important for ligand receptor recognition in both the cationic and anionic receptors of this LGIC family. Because the largest change in EC50 of the functional tryptophan mutants examined in this study was caused by the W183Y mutation, and the removal of the aromatic residue at this position ablated ligand binding, we propose that this residue is the most important tryptophan in 5-HT3 receptor ligand binding site. Recently the equivalent tryptophan in the nACh receptor (Trp149) was shown to be the primary cation π binding site in the nAChR by Zhong et al. (44.Zhong W. Gallivan J.P. Zhang Y. Li L. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12088-12093Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), using thein vivo nonsense codon suppression method of mutagenesis. The mutation of Trp195to tyrosine and serine resulted in functionally expressed receptors with modified ligand binding and electrophysiological properties. The affinity, as measured by the EC50s, for 5-HT and mCPBG were reduced in the W195Y mutant compared with WT and further reduced for 5-HT in the W195S mutant, without alteration of the Hill coefficients. Interestingly the binding characteristics of [3H]mCPBG binding were unchanged for either mutant, although [3H]granisetron binding affinities were increased. The unaffected mCPBG binding and function and unchanged Hill coefficients suggest that this mutation does not affect channel gating. Combined with the other data, we propose that changing Trp195specifically effects a region of the binding pocket that has some importance for ligand binding, and, because these mutations resulted in particularly large changes in [3H]granisetron binding affinity, it is likely that the affected region of the binding pocket participates more in antagonist than agonist binding. The 5-HT3A receptor subunit Trp195 residue aligns with tryptophan residues in GABAA α and β subunits and in glycine receptors but does not have a homologue in the nAChR subunits (Fig. 6). The tryptophan at this position in anionic channels has not been reported to be important in ligand binding or channel function. Therefore our data represent the identification of a novel ligand binding region in the 5-HT3 receptor that is not present in the other members of the Cys loop neurotransmitter family. Combining the findings from mutations at Trp90, Trp183, and Trp195, we can postulate that the cationic ligands of the 5-HT3 receptor interact with these aromatic residues, probably via cation π interactions, with Trp183 likely to be the principle tryptophan in the binding site. The homology between these putative ligand binding amino acids and the other members of the Cys loop family, demonstrates that tertiary folding of the N-terminal domain for these receptors is highly conserved."

With 3404 amino acids (392 kDa) it is the largest polypeptide sequence ever obtained for a respiratory protein. The cDNA comprises 10,758 base pairs and includes the coding regions for a short signal peptide, the eight different functional units, a 3′-untranslated region of 478 base pairs, and a poly(A) tail. The predicted protein contains 13 potential sites for N-linked carbohydrates (one for HtH1-a, none for HtH1-c, and two each for the other six functional units). Multiple sequence alignments show that the fragment HtH1-abcdefg is structurally equivalent to the seven-FU subunit from Octopus hemocyanin, which is fundamental to our understanding of the quaternary structures of both hemocyanins. Using the fossil record of the gastropod-cephalopod split to calibrate a molecular clock, the origin of the molluscan hemocyanin from a single-FU protein was calculated as 753 ± 68 million years ago.

In cephalopods, such decamers are the only hemocyanin quaternary structure observed, but in gastropods two decamers are assembled face to face to form the so-called didecamer. It is well established that the cephalopod and gastropod hemocyanin collar complexes differ considerably. Moreover, in some marine gastropods, didecamers plus decamers have been observed to form tube-like multidecamers of varying length. (For reviews, see Refs. 1.van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv.

In these species, two immunologically, physicochemically, and functionally distinct hemocyanin isoforms occur, which were first described for the keyhole limpet Megathura crenulata, where these isoforms have been termed KLH1 and KLH2 (4.Markl J.

The hemocyanin functional unit's mass is ∼50 kDa, and each carries a binuclear copper active site. The functional units are arranged as a linear sequence of seven or eight, to form the 350–400-kDa polypeptide of molluscan hemocyanin, which then represents the subunit (see Ref.1.van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The eight functional units are structurally distinct and have been termed FU-a–FU-h, starting from the N-terminal functional unit. FromOctopus dofleini hemocyanin (OdH), the complete amino acid sequence of the seven-FU subunit OdH-abcdefg is known (6.Miller K.I. Cuff M.E. Lang W.F. Varga-Weisz P. Field K.G. van Holde K.E. J.

Moreover, the x-ray structure of a crystallographic dimer of functional unit OdH-g has been solved at a 2.3-Å resolution (7.Cuff M.E. Miller K.I. van Holde K.E. Hendrickson W.A. J. Mol.

From the more complex gastropod hemocyanins, much data on disassembly, reassembly, and oxygen binding behavior is available (for review see Refs. 1.van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv.

However, when we started our sequencing work on the two isoforms of Haliotis tuberculata hemocyanin, HtH1 and HtH2, the primary structure of gastropod hemocyanin was only partially known, namely from FU-d and FU-g of Helix pomatiaand FU-a of Rapana thomasiana hemocyanin (9.Drexel R.

Stricker S. Markl J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and for HtH2-defgh (13.Lieb B. Altenhein B. Lehnert R. Gebauer W. Markl J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to complete the entire cDNA sequence coding for HtH1 and thereby provide the first complete primary structure of a gastropod hemocyanin. The European abalone Haliotis tuberculata is a member of the phylogenetically rather ancient Archaeogastropoda. Animals were gifts from Syndicat Mixte d' Equipment du Littoral Blainville sur Mer, France and Biosyn, Fellbach, Germany. The abalone were kept in a sea water aquarium at 17 °C and fed on brown algae. RNA was isolated from Haliotis tuberculata mantle tissue (1 g) using an RNeasy Maxi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the instruction manual followed by mRNA isolation using paramagnetic beads from Promega (Mannheim, Germany). Two cDNA libraries were constructed using the Lambda ZAP®-CMV cDNA synthesis kit from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany). Pooled RNA from 19 and 2 individuals, respectively, was applied. The first library stems from Keller et al. (12.Keller H. Lieb B. Altenhein B. Gebauer D. Richter S. Stricker S. Markl J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and was oligo(dT)-primed; the second library was constructed in the present study, using random primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) in addition to specific HtH1 oligonucleotides, derived from the cDNA encoding HtH1-e and HtH1-f. Screening was performed with digoxygenin-labeled DNA probes. cDNA clones obtained from the cDNA libraries were isolated using the in vivo excision protocol from Stratagene. cDNA-containing plasmids were isolated using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and restricted with EcoRI and XhoI (Stratagene) for clones that were derived from the first cDNA library where the cDNA fragments were cloned in a directional manner. In the case of the random-primed cDNA library, cDNA clones were analyzed only by EcoRI restriction. cDNA clones with different restriction patterns were sequenced by Seqlab (Göttingen, Germany) using standard primers. Subsequent sequencing reactions on both strands were performed with specific oligonucleotides. The obtained sequences were analyzed by the latest versions of CHROMAS, Translate Tool, ALIGN, and Signal P from Ex PASy Proteomics Tools; Clustal (14.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55721) Google Scholar); and TreeView® (15.Page R.D.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar); all of these programs are freely available in the Internet. Corrected pairwise distances were calculated with the PROTDIST program of the PHYLIP software package (16.Felsenstein J. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package) Version 3.5c. University of Washington, Seattle1993Google Scholar) and scaled in expected historical events per site (17.Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. 1979; 5 Suppl. 3: 345-352Google Scholar). Distance matrices were imported into the Microsoft Excel for Windows 97 spread sheet program, and the divergence times were inferred under the assumption that the gastropodan and cephalopodan hemocyanins diverged 520 million years ago (18.Benton M.J. The Fossil Record 2. Chapman & Hall, London1993: 125-270Google Scholar). From the two cDNA libraries we isolated five different cDNA clones, together encoding the previously unknown N-terminal fragment HtH1-abcde and the recently published C-terminal fragment HtH1-fgh (see Ref. 12.Keller H. Lieb B. Altenhein B. Gebauer D. Richter S. Stricker S. Markl J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) of the subunit of Haliotis hemocyanin isoform 1 (HtH1). Overlapping regions of about 300 bp of the different cDNA clones were analyzed to ensure that they represented a single mRNA. The complete cDNA encoding HtH1 comprises 10,758 bp (including a 3′-untranslated region of 478 bp plus a poly(A) tail of 18 bp); it is available from the EBI Data Bank (accession number Y13219). The 5′-terminal sequence encodes a short signal peptide, typical for a protein synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is compatible with our current knowledge of hemocyanin biosynthesis in the pore cells of Haliotis (19.Albrecht U. Markl J. Verh. Dtsch. Zool. Ges. 1995; 88: 156Google Scholar). Numerous attempts by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or cDNA screening to obtain the 5′-untranslated region and the triplet ATG coding for the very first methionine of the subunit have been unsuccessful to date. We assume that there are still a few amino acids of the signal peptide missing, but from the N-terminal motif of the biochemically isolated HtH1 subunit obtained by direct protein sequencing (DNVVRKDVSHLTDDEVQ; see Ref. 12.Keller H. Lieb B. Altenhein B. Gebauer D. Richter S. Stricker S. Markl J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it is clear that we have now obtained the complete sequence of the hemocyanin secreted into the hemolymph. The amino acid sequence of the Haliotis hemocyanin subunit predicted from the cDNA sequence contains 3404 amino acids plus the signal peptide of 15 amino acids (Fig.1). Identification of the latter was confirmed using the computer program Signal P (not shown). Because the only molluscan hemocyanin subunit completely sequenced previously, fromOctopus, has a length of 2896 amino acids due to its lack of FU-h (6.Miller K.I. Cuff M.E. Lang W.F. Varga-Weisz P. Field K.G. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 827-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the present Haliotis hemocyanin primary structure is the largest ever obtained for a respiratory protein, and it is certainly among the largest polypeptides in nature. The sequence is clearly substructured into eight homologous regions of 405–420 amino acids (Fig. 1), corresponding to the eight different functional units HtH1-a–HtH1-h identified at the protein level; HtH1-h carries a unique tail extension of ∼95 additional amino acids (see also Ref. 12.Keller H. Lieb B. Altenhein B. Gebauer D. Richter S. Stricker S. Markl J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The N-terminal partial sequences of the biochemically isolated HtH1 functional units obtained from direct Edman degradation (12.Keller H. Lieb B. Altenhein B. Gebauer D. Richter S. Stricker S. Markl J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) fit the present sequence 100%, which was therefore conclusively identified as HtH1. Moreover, the ∼300-bp sequence overlaps of the cDNA clones ensured that we did indeed analyze cDNAs encoding a continuous polypeptide chain. For each functional unit, some characteristics calculated from the sequence are shown in TableI. A multiple sequence alignment of the different functional units from HtH1 and OdH is shown in Fig.2. For illustration of the structural aspects, a schematic representation of the x-ray structure of OdH-g is given in Fig. 3 (re-drawn from Refs. 6.Miller K.I. Cuff M.E. Lang W.F. Varga-Weisz P.

In contrast, the identity of the arc-forming functional units HtH1-g and HtH2-g is significantly higher (74%), and the identity of the collar-forming components HtH1-h and HtH2-h is somewhat lower (60%).

The molecular mass discrepancies in the case of HtH1-a and HtH1-d suggest that the two proteolytic fragments did not correspond exactly to a single functional unit, respectively. Note that except for HtH1-c, 1000–2000 Da should be added per functional unit for carbohydrate side chains, as deduced from the situation in OdH-g (6,7). BothOctopus and Sepia hemocyanin have been studied to much detail (see Refs. 1.van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Lamy J. Leclerc J.

Cuff M.E. Lang W.F. Varga-Weisz P. Field K.G. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 827-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, cephalopod hemocyanins are restricted to decamers, and therefore, their analysis is inefficient to explain the didecamers and multidecamers observed in other molluscan classes, notably the Gastropoda. In gastropods, the “classical” hemocyanin studied is that from Helix pomatia (see Ref. 1.van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its sequence is only partially known (see Fig. 5). The recent biochemical characterization ofHaliotis hemocyanin (12.Keller H. Lieb B.

Biochem. 1999; 265: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), in combination with the complete amino acid sequence presented here, now establishes HtH1 as the gastropod reference hemocyanin.

Biochem. 1997; 248: 602-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) can now be approached at the single amino acid level. More importantly, the combined present and future data fromOctopus and Haliotis hemocyanin will enable fundamental questions on the structure-function relationships of molluscan hemocyanin to be solved, which could not be efficiently addressed if only one of the two reference sequences was available. For example, the sequence of Octopus hemocyanin alone allowed the identification of amino acid residues that are conserved in all seven functional units (6.Miller K.I. Cuff M.E. Lang W.F. Varga-Weisz P. Field K.G. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 827-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), whereas together with theHaliotis hemocyanin sequence, residues can now be identified that have been specifically conserved in corresponding functional units over more than 500 million years but are different in the other functional unit types (Fig. 2). In addition, gastropod- and cephalopod-specific sequence motifs are now discernible (Fig. 2). Thus, efficient strategies for the analysis of specific functions of the different functional units (for example, with recombinant hemocyanin) can now be designed, which was impossible on the basis of theOctopus sequence alone. Moreover, tracing the as yet unclear path of the elongated subunit within the native quaternary structures is now greatly facilitated, because electron microscopical and biochemical data from the decameric cephalopod and the didecameric gastropod hemocyanin can now be combined on the basis of sequence alignments. Ultimately, the date of the evolutionary origin of molluscan hemocyanin, which was previously only roughly estimated (1.van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13.Lieb B. Altenhein B. Lehnert R. Gebauer W. Markl J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), can now be traced with greatly improved accuracy by using the complete cephalopod and the complete gastropod hemocyanin primary structure in combination. The total molecular mass of the secreted polypeptide calculated from the sequence (therefore neglecting possible carbohydrate side chains) is 392 kDa. This is very close to the value of ∼400 kDa measured in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for both HtH1 and KLH1 (12.Keller H. Lieb B. Altenhein B. Gebauer D. Richter S. Stricker S. Markl J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24.Söhngen S.M. Stahlmann A. Harris J.R. Müller S.A. Engel A. Markl J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 602-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). From the multitude of conserved and variable structural features visible in Fig. 2, the potential N-linked carbohydrate sites (NXT/S) will now be discussed in more detail. 13 such sites exist in the sequence ofHaliotis hemocyanin isoform HtH1 (Fig. 1), which, according to the x-ray structure of functional unit OdH-g from Octopushemocyanin (Fig. 3), would all be accessible on the protein's surface.

The choice of these amino acids changes was dictated from an analysis of the TspO family of proteins derived from the data bases. These studies demonstrated the importance of several highly conserved tryptophan residues in the sensory transduction pathway involving TspO through the proposed binding of an intermediate(s) in the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. These studies also revealed that the substitution of one or several of the amino acid residues dramatically affected, either directly or indirectly, the levels of TspO in the membranes of R. sphaeroides. Mounting evidence is presented suggesting that TspO normally forms a dimer within the bacterial outer membrane, and the dimer form of TspO may be the active form for TspO function. Because our earlier studies provided us with a functional framework within which to view these amino acid substitutions, we are able to suggest a preliminary model for TspO structure-function. Not only do these studies tell us more about TspO, but they also shed light on the TspO homologue, the drug-binding component of the mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor.

This outer membrane-localized protein was predicted to contain five membrane-spanning domains, and was shown to be involved in the transport or efflux of tetrapyrrole intermediates of the heme/bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic pathway (1.Yeliseev A.A. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21234-21243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). TspO is very similar to the major drug-binding component (pk18) of the mammalian mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (MBR) (2.Yeliseev A.A. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21167-21175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) which is nuclear encoded, as well as to the predicted protein products encoded in a number of recently sequenced genomes (Fig. 1). A cDNA encoding rat pk18 was expressed in R. sphaeroides TSPO1 cells, and was shown to functionally substitute for its bacterial homologue, negatively affecting the transcription of specifically targeted photosynthesis genes. Furthermore, the rat protein was shown to reside exclusively in the outer membrane of R. sphaeroides as does TspO, but not when expressed in Escherichia coli, and was shown to bind a series of benzodiazepines with the same functional order and with the same K d values as when present in the mitochondrial outer membrane (3.Yeliseev A.A. Krueger K.E. Kaplan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These results, and others to be discussed, demonstrate a close evolutionary and functional relationship between the bacterial and mammalian receptors, and indicate the likelihood that they play a similar biological role in their respective cell types (3.Yeliseev A.A. Krueger K.E. Kaplan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For both TspO and pk18, it is not immediately obvious as to what intrinsic signals cause their localization to the R. sphaeroides outer membrane(s) nor is it obvious how pk18 is targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane (3.Yeliseev A.A. Krueger K.E. Kaplan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Despite the extensive studies of the mammalian MBR, the precise biological function of this receptor remains elusive. It has been demonstrated that MBR binds with high affinity to a number of benzodiazepine and isoquinoline carboxamide ligands, as well as to the dicarboxylic porphyrins (4.Krueger K.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 453-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, in studies of the structural properties of this receptor, researchers assessed the effect of the introduction of mutations in the cognate gene and studied the ability of the altered protein to bind benzodiazepines when the gene was introduced into yeast cells, which have no pk18 homologue (5.Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Loison G. Ferrara P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 6.Farges R. Joseph-Liazun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that Glu29, Arg32, and Lys39, which are located in the first putative cytoplasmic loop, are involved in binding of Ro5-4864, but do not affect the binding of isoquinoline carboxamides (6.Farges R. Joseph-Liazun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar). Li and Papadopoulos (7.Li H. Papadopoulos V. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4991-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated the effect of internal deletions as well as certain point mutations in pk18 upon the transport of cholesterol in steroidogenic mammalian cells. They suggested that MBR may have a channel-like function for cholesterol in the outer mitochondrial membrane, and that the C-terminal part of pk18 is involved in the interaction of the receptor with cholesterol. The fact that MBR is present at high levels in a number of non-steroidogenic tissues, suggests the possible involvement of this receptor in a variety of cellular functions. We have earlier demonstrated by having developed a series of “assays” for TspO function, that the bacterial homologue of MBR, the TspO of R. sphaeroides regulates the transcriptional expression of specific photosynthesis genes in response to oxygen/light (2.Yeliseev A.A. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21167-21175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). More recently we have shown (1.Yeliseev A.A. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21234-21243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that this regulation is likely to occur through the formation of a co-repressor, as a function of the activity of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase. We presented evidence which suggested that this enzyme activity is ultimately regulated by TspO as it facilitates the efflux of specific intermediates in the tetrapyrrole pathway. Therefore it is now possible to study the structural properties of TspO in relation to these and to other regulatory function(s) associated with TspO. In order to gain further insight into the function of this integral membrane protein, we introduced a number of point mutations intotspO, and expressed the mutated gene in trans in TSPO1 mutant cells. The choice of which residues were to be altered was derived from the close amino acid sequence identities which exist within the TspO family of proteins. We present results indicating that certain amino acid substitutions dramatically affected TspO function as monitored through specific target gene regulation as well as tetrapyrrole efflux. Based upon these findings we suggest that these amino acid residues may comprise a binding site for intermediate(s) of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway. Finally, we present evidence that TspO forms a homodimer within the bacterial outer membrane and that dimerization may play a role in TspO function. These results are discussed in light of earlier as well as more recent findings in order that we may present a working model of TspO structure and function.

Equivalent protein concentrations of the cell extracts were used when the spectral profiles of different strains ofR. sphaeroides were compared. Standard procedures were used for plasmid isolation, restriction endonuclease digestion, isolation of DNA fragments from gels, ligations, and other molecular biological techniques (11.Maniatis T.

DNA sequencing was performed with an ABI 373A automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) at the DNA Core Facility of the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics. For pulse-chase experiments 1.6 μCi/mg protein of l-[35S]methionine was added to cultures for 1.5 min followed by a chase with excess (≥500-fold) unlabeled methionine for up to 3 h. Aliquots were removed and immediately precipitated with 10% (final concentration) cold trichloroacetic acid. Pellets were washed two times with acetone, dried, and re-suspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1% SDS and heated for 5 min at 100 °C to solubilize proteins. TspO was subjected to immunoprecipitation with TspO-specific antibodies (2.Yeliseev A.A. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21167-21175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) using a protocol described for the immunoprecipitation of reaction center polypeptides of R. sphaeroides (14.Varga A.R. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19842-19850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After proteins were resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE, the gels were treated with ENTENSIFY (NEN Life Science Products Inc.), dried, and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat AR, Eastman Kodak). A minimum of two independent labeling experiments were performed for each mutant strain. Exposed films were scanned, and relative band intensities corresponding to labeled proteins were determined using the ImageQuant computer program. Chemical stability determinations for steady-state levels of TspO was conducted as follows. Cultures were grown aerobically (20% O2, 78% N2, 2% CO2) to an A 600 of 0.3, a sample was removed (at time 0), and chloramphenicol was added (final concentration 100 μg/ml) to the remainder, to stop protein synthesis. Equivalent samples were then removed at 2, 4, 7, and 20 h later. All samples were immediately precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and suspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Shuell). TspO was detected by immunoblotting with anti-TspO polyclonal antibody. R. sphaeroides cells were grown aerobically (20% O2, 78% N2, 2% CO2) or photosynthetically (98% N2, 2% CO2, 10 W/m2), collected by centrifugation, and re-suspended in reaction buffer (0.1 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4). Glutardialdehyde (GA) was added to a final concentration of 0.2%, and cells were incubated at room temperature for 40 min with shaking. Following incubation, a 1 m glycine solution was added to the suspension to a final concentration of 0.1 m to quench the excess of the unreacted GA. Cells were washed twice with the potassium phosphate buffer, and resuspended in the protein sample buffer containing SDS. Samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Similar procedures were applied when another water-soluble cross-linking reagent, 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate), DTSSP was used. In the experiments on the stabilization of the dimer form of TspO by porphyrinogens, aerobic grown R. sphaeroides TSPO1 cells containing either wild type or mutant W38C TspO were collected by centrifugation, re-suspended in 0.1 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and incubated in the presence of 5 μm of either porphyrins (coproporphyrin III or protoporphyrin IX) or porphyrinogens (coproporphyrinogen III or protoporphyrinogen IX) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then separated by centrifugation, washed twice with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and proteins resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Equivalent amounts of protein (40 μg) were applied per lane. Porphyrinogens were freshly prepared from the respective porphyrins (Porphyrin Products, Logan, UT) by reduction with sodium amalgam essentially as described in Refs. 15.Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A.

Single or multiple amino acid substitutions in TspO were introduced using a PCR QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), with some modifications. Because of the high GC content of the R. sphaeroides DNA, high annealing temperatures (98 °C) were used, and all reaction buffers were supplemented with dimethyl sulfoxide to a final concentration of 5%. After the PCR was completed, DNA was precipitated with 70% ethanol, dried, re-suspended in buffer, and digested with DpnI as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmids harboring the tspO gene, encoding either single or multiple amino acid substitutions in TspO, under control of the PrrnB, were constructed using the QuickChange PCR kit. Plasmid pUI1124 containing the wild type copy of tspO underrrnB promoter was used as a template in a PCR, according to the protocol, recommended by the manufacturer. The mutated plasmid containing a tspO-specific mutation was then digested withAsp718-HindIII, and a 1.1-kilobase fragment containing tspO under PrrnB was gel-purified, and ligated into pRK415 digested with Asp718-HindIII.

DTSSP was from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Other reagents were from Sigma. Vitamins and antibiotics were obtained from Sigma. Restriction endonucleases and nucleic acid-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The PCR mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Although the precise physiologic role of TspO remains unclear, we do know that TspO is involved with the sensory transduction pathway through which specific genes of the PpsR regulon are controlled at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, we know that TspO is involved in the efflux of porphyrin intermediates from the cell (1.Yeliseev A.A. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21234-21243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and recent evidence suggests that it is this latter mode of action which ultimately leads to the accumulation of a putative corepressor molecule resulting from the activity of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase. These and other properties of TspO (see below), which are shared by the rat pk18 (3.Yeliseev A.A. Krueger K.E. Kaplan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), make TspO an excellent model to understand the physiologic role of both these receptors. Thus, we directed our investigation based upon the fact that a number of amino acid residues are conserved in theR. sphaeroides TspO, in its mammalian homologues, as well as in many of the more recently discovered homologues encoded by the genomes of recently sequenced bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. We reasoned that because of the interchangeability of the rat and bacterial proteins in R. sphaeroides, these residues should serve functional roles of these diverse proteins and are therefore likely targets for our analysis (Fig. 1). Mutations were introduced into the tspO sequence as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the mutated genes were expressed in TSPO1 cells in trans under the control of PrrnB (2.Yeliseev A.A. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21167-21175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The introduction of the mutated tspOgenes in R. sphaeroides cells devoid of the wild type gene did not result in any noticeable changes in the growth characteristics of the bacterial cells, with but one exception. Mutant W38C exhibited a significant lag period when growing either aerobically or photosynthetically, and its doubling time was 2–3 times longer than that of the other mutants or wild type (results not shown). Further analysis demonstrated that the levels of the TspO protein in mutant W38C exceeded by 8-fold the levels of the wild type TspO, when overexpressed from the plasmid pUI2701 (Fig.2). In previous studies we have shown that TspO resides exclusively in the outer membrane of R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 whether expressed in cis or overexpressed in trans (2.Yeliseev A.A. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21167-21175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, in order to make accurate, quantitative comparisons of the levels of wild type and mutant forms of TspO, whole cell extracts were used to monitor TspO levels. As a result we were less concerned regarding differential recovery experienced during outer membrane purification. Our results appear to support this assumption. For comparison, the level of TspO in wild type 2.4.1 cells grown aerobically, is 3–5% of the level of TspO in TSPO1 (pUI2701) when expressed in trans. In anaerobically grown wild type cells the level of TspO increases to 25–30% of that in TSPO1 (pUI2701) (see Fig. 2). In order to determine the overall expression of the mutated genes, we performed Western blot analysis of all of the strains with identical growth characteristics. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 2. As is evident from Fig. 2, the substitution of different amino acid residues at different locations in the TspO sequence resulted in marked changes in the cellular levels of several of these proteins in R. sphaeroides. These alterations in TspO levels can be divided into three broad categories: (i) changes, which did not appreciably alter TspO level from the wild type control; (ii) changes, which increased, or (iii) decreased TspO levels relative to the wild type control. For example, substitution K36A or W38C led to a sharp increase in the amount of protein product. On the other hand, substitution of C15S, L34G, or W135F led to significant decreases in the levels of the protein in R. sphaeroides. Mutants W30F, W39F, W44F, W50F, Q80A, R96A, or E29G/Leu/W30R did not result in any noticeable changes in TspO levels. Interestingly, several single amino acid substitutions led not only to changes in the amount of protein product, but also resulted in an apparent change of its mobility in SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 2 A). For example, W135F resulted in decreased mobility of this protein in SDS-PAGE, perhaps by altering the conformation of TspO or the ability of the mutant TspO to bind SDS. Mutant W38C resulted in the appearance of two additional bands in the Western blot, at 18 and 32–33 kDa. This latter band coincides with the anticipated homodimer form of TspO (see below). There are several obvious explanations for changes of TspO levels in the mutant cells relative to the wild type, one of which is changes in the stability of the protein. In an attempt to obtain insight into the mechanism by which levels of TspO are regulated in R. sphaeroides cells, we studied the incorporation and stability of wild type and mutant TspO into membranes of TSPO1 cells. Total membrane fractions were isolated from R. sphaeroides cells expressing either wild type or altered TspO, which had been previously pulse-chase radiolabeled with [35S]methionine. TspO was immunoprecipitated from isolated membranes, subjected to electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-PAGE, and to radioautography, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.3). The relative amounts of35S label incorporation in the wild type and mutant TspO (K36A, W44F, L34G, and C15S) immediately after the 35S pulse, as determined by radoiautography (Fig. 3), correlated well with the relative levels of TspO measured by Western blot (see Fig. 2). For example, there was an approximate 3–4-fold increase in radiolabel incorporation in K36A over the levels observed for the wild type TspO, which was set at 100%. On the other hand, mutants C15S and L34G were characterized by low levels of radiolabel incorporation (about 10% that of the wild type), consistent with the observed lower levels of these proteins, as determined by immunoassay. Finally, the levels of labeled wild type"
https://openalex.org/W1983197606,"The mdm2 oncogene encodes p90(MDM2), which binds to and inactivates the p53 tumor suppressor protein. p90(MDM2) inhibits p53 by blocking the transcriptional activation domain of p53 as well as by stimulating its degradation. Recently, we showed that another product of the wild-type mdm2 gene, p76(MDM2), lacks the first 49 amino acids of p90(MDM2) and cannot bind p53. Here, we report that, like p90(MDM2), p76(MDM2) is expressed in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Overexpression of p76(MDM2) antagonizes the ability of p90(MDM2) to stimulate the degradation of p53 and leads to an increase in the levels and activity of p53. Seven murine tissues express an alternatively spliced mdm2 mRNA that can encode p76(MDM2) but not p90(MDM2), as well as the normally spliced mdm2 mRNA that encodes both MDM2 proteins. All seven tissues express both MDM2 proteins. p90(MDM2) is much more abundant than p76(MDM2) in the testis, brain, heart, and kidney. However, in those tissues known to undergo p53-mediated apoptosis in response to gamma-irradiation, the thymus, spleen, and intestine, the levels of the MDM2 proteins are roughly equivalent. Our results indicate that the ratio of the two MDM2 proteins may regulate the response of tissues to DNA damage."

By contrast, an analog of IGF-I with very low affinity for the insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGF-BPs), des-(1–3)-IGF-I, was not competitive with 125I-IGF-I for cartilage binding even at 100–400 nm.

These findings are reconciled by the proposal that the IGF-BPs play an inhibitory role during the disease, blocking the actions of excess IGF-I (3.Tardiff G. Reboul P. Pelletier J.P. Geng C.

While the function of the IGF-BPs in osteoarthritic cartilage remains to be proven, the role of IGF-BPs in normal articular cartilage was recently studied in bovine cartilage organ cultures. These experiments compared the action of native IGF-I to that of site-mutated analogs of IGF-I with very low binding affinity for IGF-BPs, but with nearly normal binding to the signaling receptors (10.Morales T.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The IGF-I analogs were more effective than their native counterpart in stimulating proteoglycan synthesis when added to cultured cartilage slices, strongly suggesting that the dominant endogenous IGF-BP activity was inhibitory to IGF action. Synovial fluid has a significant concentration of IGFs, ∼20–50 ng/ml in adult normal human (9.Schneiderman R. Rosenberg N. Hiss J. Lee P. Liu F. Hintz R. Maroudas A. Arch. Biochem.

Chondrocytes express IGF-I mRNA and may also contribute to the endogenous pool of this growth factor (6.Olney R.C. Tsuchiya K. Wilson D.M. Mohtaie M. Maloney W.J. Schurman D.J. Smith R.L. J. Clin.

In adult articular cartilage, single chondrocytes are surrounded by vast areas of matrix, through which IGFs must be transported to reach a responsive cell. A general proposal in the literature is that transport of IGFs from the circulation to extravascular spaces may be controlled by the IGF-BPs; this may be a mechanism governing paracrine activities of IGFs within tissues as well. Studies that directly examine binding of IGFs to intact tissue and/or their transport have been very sparse and have not been fully comprehensive. To enhance our understanding of the interactions of the IGFs with endogenous tissue sites and the diffusion of this growth factor through cartilage, we now quantify the binding of IGFs to bovine articular cartilage, and examine the involvement of IGF-BPs in this process. We provide a line of evidence that IGFs bind to articular cartilage discs through IGF-BPs. 1) Binding of 125I-IGF-I or II to cartilage is specific; 2) an analog of IGF-I (des-(1–3)-IGF-I) with very low affinity for the IGF-BPs but normal affinity for the signaling receptor is unable to compete with radiolabeled IGF-I for binding to the cartilage discs, while the native IGF is a highly effective competitor; and 3) the characteristics of125I-IGF-I and II binding to the tissue are as expected for their binding in solution to IGF-BP-6, a major bovine cartilage IGF-BP. In addition, we use a transport apparatus to show directly that IGF binding contributes to the regulation of radiolabeled IGF transport through cartilage discs. Our studies provide strong support for the concept that IGF-BPs are important regulators of the bioavailability of IGFs in articular cartilage.

Acid dialysis solution consisted of 4 mm HCl, containing 1 mm o-Phe, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 μg/ml each of pepstatin A and leupeptin. Immediately prior to use, the lyophilized125I-IGF was dissolved in 300 μl of 0.01 mHac + 0.1% BSA, and run on a 0.6 × 30-cm Sephadex G50 column equilibrated in phosphate buffer at 14 °C to ensure removal of any small molecular weight radiolabel. The fractions corresponding to authentic unlabeled hrIGF standard were pooled, concentrated, and exchanged into binding buffer in a Centricon-3 filter (Amicon). This was done essentially as described before (10.Morales T.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, slices of bovine articular cartilage from the femoropatellar grooves of adult animals (of approximately 18–24 months of age), or from the metacarpophalangeal joints of 2–6-week-old calves were diced into small pieces and extracted in urea buffer at 4 °C. The extracts were run on DEAE-Sepharose equilibrated in the same buffer to remove proteoglycans (which bind to the column), the effluent fractions were pooled, dialyzed against acidic solution, and concentrated in a speed vacuum centrifuge. Glycosaminoglycan content in the samples was determined by the dimethylmethylene blue dye binding procedure (12.Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2874) Google Scholar), and protein was analyzed by the bicinchoninic procedure (MicroBCA), as directed by the manufacturer (Pierce). The dried samples were resuspended directly in non-reducing SDS sample buffer at 1 μg of protein/μl, and 25 μg applied per electrophoresis well. Western ligand blots were carried out as described previously using125I-IGF-II as the binding ligand (10.Morales T.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13.Yang I.M. Rechler M.M de Pablo F. Scanes C. Handbook of Endocrine Research Techniques. Academic Press, New York1994: 181-204Google Scholar). Cylindrical plugs of cartilage with the underlying bone slightly greater than 9 mm in diameter were cored from the femoropatellar grooves of ∼18–24-month-old steers. Cartilage-bone plugs were clamped in a sledge microtome and the top ∼150 μm of superficial cartilage was removed. Plane parallel discs of 400 μm thickness were then obtained and subsequently punched to 3 or 9 mm diameter. During the harvest, tissue was maintained hydrated with PBS supplemented with 2 mm EDTA, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and amphotericin B (0.25 μg/ml). Adult bovine articular cartilage (3 mm diameter × 400 μm thick) was prepared from femoropatellar groove cartilage as described above. After a 10–20-h equilibration in binding buffer, the discs were transferred to 24-well culture plates containing fresh buffer. In an effort to randomize any differences between different parts of the joint, four to five discs were carefully selected, one each from different anatomical locations, and pooled in each well.125I-IGF-I or II, as appropriate, was then added to each well (specific activity 2000 Ci/mmol, an average of ∼ 2 × 105 cpm/well, or 0.033 nm125I-IGF). Graded levels of unlabeled hrIGF-I, hrIGF-II, or des-(1–3)-IGF-I were then added (or no additions made) as indicated for each experiment. The incubation volume of 1.5 ml/well was at least 100 times the cartilage volume. Following a 48-h incubation at 4 °C, each disc was transferred into a wash well containing fresh, IGF-free binding buffer, removed within seconds, and transferred into a counting vial. The equilibration fluid for each well was counted separately. Immediately prior to weighing, each disc was blotted dry on gauze pads. In selected experiments, the equilibration fluid was analyzed by Sephadex G-50 chromatography to determine whether there had been significant degradation of the 125I-IGF during the incubation. This was not the case, as >95% of the radiolabel comigrated with the authentic unlabeled IGF standard (results not shown). Cartilage discs (9 mm diameter × 400 μm depth) were maintained at 4 °C in PBS with inhibitors (as described above) until mounted in the transport chamber. The transport measurement system has been previously described in detail (14.Garcia A.M. Lark M.W. Trippel S.B. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Orthopaedic Res. 1998; 16: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, a two-compartment acrylic diffusion chamber (Fig. 5, inset) had ports to fit up to five cartilage discs (exposed tissue area for transport = 0.38 cm2/disc). Gaskets and O-rings were used to seal the tissue samples in place so that, when the two chamber halves were assembled, transport between compartments could occur only through the tissue. The baths on either side of the cartilage consisted of PBS supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (2 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine HCl, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Temperature was maintained at 20 °C. Both compartments were open to ambient pressure, and portions of the downstream bath were recirculated at 1–3 ml/min through a modified flow-through 125I-radioactivity detector (14.Garcia A.M. Lark M.W. Trippel S.B. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Orthopaedic Res. 1998; 16: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Downstream radioactivity as measured by the detector was continuously recorded at 6-s intervals by the computer. Previous work (10.Morales T.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) identified IGF-BPs in cartilage obtained from the MCP joints of young and adult bovines. The MCP cartilage is relatively thin and rests on curved bone surfaces. To facilitate the preparation of cartilage discs of 400 μm depth, we used femoropatellar groove (FPG) cartilage from adult animals, which is relatively thick and rests on a fairly smooth planar surface. Biochemical variations in cartilages from different joints, including differential susceptibility to metabolic effectors have been reported (15.Kang Y. Koepp H. Cole A.A. Kuettner K.E. Homanberg G.A. J. Orthopaedic Res. 1998; 15: 551-556Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), so it was important to determine if the bovine FPG cartilage had a similar IGF-BP profile as the previously characterized tissue dissected from MCP joints. To provide a direct side by side comparison, cartilage slices from each of the two joint sources (FPG and MCP) were each extracted, purified, and analyzed under parallel conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig.1 shows the Western ligand blot.125I-IGF-II was used as the binding ligand since it detects all the IGF-BPs at least as well as the IGF-I ligand (13.Yang I.M. Rechler M.M de Pablo F. Scanes C. Handbook of Endocrine Research Techniques. Academic Press, New York1994: 181-204Google Scholar), and ensures detection of IGF-BP-6, which reacts weakly if at all with125I-IGF-I under these conditions (10.Morales T.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13.Yang I.M. Rechler M.M de Pablo F. Scanes C. Handbook of Endocrine Research Techniques. Academic Press, New York1994: 181-204Google Scholar). Lane 1 shows the migration of IGF-BPs from the MCP cartilage, andlanes 2 and 3 show the binding proteins from FPG cartilage derived from the joints of two different bovines. As can be seen, the major IGF-BP in all three lanes migrated to a position above that of the M r 21,500 standard, with an apparentM r of ∼23,000. This protein was previously identified in MCP cartilage as IGF-BP-6 by Western immunoblotting and by its marked preferential affinity for IGF-II over IGF-I (10.Morales T.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The identity of the bands was further verified by lowering the exposure time of the films to a third of the time shown in Fig. 1 (lower exposure = 24 h); the typical cartilage IGF-BP-6 doublet observed in previous studies (10.Morales T.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was evident in the cartilage samples. The smaller M r band had a similar migration velocity to the M r 21,500 standard and a lower intensity than the larger band in the pair (data not shown). All of the above data support the identification of this major protein as IGF-BP-6. An additional band of M r ∼32,000 was seen in the blots, its migration coinciding with that of the hrIGF-BP-2 standard (lane 5), while being slightly slower than the MCP cartilage IGF-BP previously identified as IGF-BP-2. Additionally, a doublet of larger size (M r ∼ 43,500–41,500) typical of glycosylated IGF-BP-3 was also faintly seen in one of the samples (lane 3). This IGF-BP has not been definitively identified in any bovine cartilage, but a doublet of similar size has been identified in human OA cartilage (3.Tardiff G. Reboul P. Pelletier J.P. Geng C. Cloutier J.M. Martel Pelletier J. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 968-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 6.Olney R.C. Tsuchiya K. Wilson D.M. Mohtaie M. Maloney W.J. Schurman D.J. Smith R.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metabol. 1996; 81: 1096-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and more variably in apparently normal cartilage (3.Tardiff G. Reboul P. Pelletier J.P. Geng C. Cloutier J.M. Martel Pelletier J. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 968-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We concluded from these experiments that the FPG cartilage contains an IGF-BP pattern very similar to that identified in bovine MCP cartilage, IGF-BP-6 providing a dominant signal as assessed by Western ligand blot analysis. Experiments were carried out to test the effect of graded levels of unlabeled IGF-I as competitor to125I-IGF-I for binding to cartilage discs (incubation was for 48 h at 4 °C in the absence of competitor, or in the presence of 0.1–200 nm IGF-I). Fig.2 A shows the results. Competition was concentration-dependent with unlabeled IGF-I concentration and reached saturation by ∼50 nm (binding of 125I-IGF-I remained constant at 12–13% of the total in the presence of 50, 100, and 200 nm IGF-I, denoting the unspecific binding component). The ED50 (the point at which 50% of the specific binding of the tracer is inhibited by unlabeled IGF) was ∼11 nm (see inset in Fig. 4 for a linear plot of the data and dashed lines used to calculate specific binding). Fig. 2B shows the parallel experiment in which the IGF-II isoform was used as the unlabeled binding competitor. Again, there was a concentration-dependent competition with 125I-IGF-I for binding to the cartilage discs, with saturation of the response by 50 nm (binding of the tracer was constant at 11–15% between 50 and 200 nm). The ED50 was ∼10 nm, indicating that IGF-I and IGF-II are equipotent in the competition with IGF-I tracer for binding to cartilage sites.Figure 4Competition of unlabeled IGF-I and IGF-II with 125I-IGF-II for binding to bovine articular cartilage. This experiment was similar to that shown in abar format in Fig. 2, except that IGF-II is used as the binding tracer. For comparison, the data of Fig. 2 are replotted in a linear form as an inset labeled 125 I-IGF-I. As indicated in the figure, for both the inset and the main figure, the ● symbols connected by solid lines represent the competition by IGF-I, and the ♦ symbols connected by solid lines represent the competition by IGF-II. The upper horizontal dashed line across the graph indicates the binding of tracer in the absence of competitor, and the lower horizontal dashed line denotes the level at which saturation is reached by the IGF-II competitor (the unspecific binding component); these lines were used as boundaries to denote the specific binding component and evaluate the ED50values for competition by the unlabeled IGFs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Des-(1–3)-IGF-I is a truncated, naturally occurring form of IGF-I that has been shown to have an average of only ∼1% of the affinity of native IGF-I for the IGF-BPs, while retaining affinity of intact IGF-I for the signaling IGF-type I receptor (16.Ballard F.J.

Metabol. 1991; 73: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The des-(1–3)-IGF-I variant lacks the 3 amino-terminal amino acids, and systematic studies have shown that removal of Glu3 accounts for the dramatic loss of binding affinity for the IGF-BPs. We postulated that if binding of IGF-I to cartilage occurs through IGF-BP sites, des-(1–3)-IGF-I would be unable to effectively compete with 125I-IGF-I for binding to this tissue. In a competition experiment, native hrIGF-I from R & D systems or from Gropep showed 80–82% inhibition of 125I-IGF-I binding to cartilage at 50–100 nm (Fig.3 A). On the other hand, hr-des-(1–3)-IGF-I was unable to compete with the radiolabeled ligand at any of the concentrations tested, which included the 50–400 nm range (Fig. 3 B). This experiment strongly suggests that the IGF-BPs are involved in the specific binding of IGF-I to cartilage. To further test the hypothesis that IGF-BPs constitute the major binding sites for IGFs in cartilage, we set up an additional competition experiment between IGF-II tracer and the two unlabeled IGFs. The experiment was based on the following considerations. It is well documented in the literature that IGF-BP-6 is distinctive in that it displays a much higher affinity for IGF-II than IGF-I in competition experiments carried out in solution when IGF-II is used as the tracer, but this differential affinity is not as marked when radiolabeled IGF-I is used. The measured potencies of IGF-II/IGF-I for competition with 125I-IGF-II range between 20 and 70, while the differences are only ∼2-fold when125I-IGF-I is used as the tracer (Ref. 19.Rhoghani M. Lassarre C. Zapf J. Povoa G. Binoux M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metabol. 1991; 73: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar; for review, see Ref. 20.Rechler M.M. Vitam. Horm. 1993; 47: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Another potentially important cartilage IGF-BP, IGF-BP-2, also displays higher affinity for IGF-II than IGF-I in solution studies, even though the differences on the average are not as pronounced as for IGF-BP-6: the reported potency ratios of IGF-II/IGF-I for IGF-BP-2 competition with 125I-IGF-II vary between 2- and 40-fold (19.Rhoghani M. Lassarre C. Zapf J. Povoa G. Binoux M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metabol. 1991; 73: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20.Rechler M.M. Vitam. Horm. 1993; 47: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). We reasoned that because of its endogenous IGF-BP content (IGF-BP-2 and -6), articular cartilage would probably show a preferential affinity for IGF-II versus IGF-I when125I-IGF-II is used as a tracer. When IGF-II was used to compete with this tracer for binding to cartilage, the ED50for inhibition was 8 nm (Fig.4), compared with an ED50 of 160 nm when IGF-I was used as the binding competitor (potency ratio for IGF-II/IGF-I: 20). Together with the results obtained with the des-(1–3)-IGF-I analog, these results strongly suggest that endogenous IGF-BPs in native cartilage constitute a major pool of binding sites for IGFs in articular cartilage. These experiments were designed to test the ability of IGF-I to diffuse through the full depth of the cartilage discs, and to assess the role of specific binding of the growth factor in this process. In these series of experiments, consistent with the results of Fig. 2 A, a bolus of 100 ng of IGF-I effectively competed with radiolabeled IGF-I for binding to cartilage discs in equilibrium binding experiments. This concentration of IGF-I was used to compete for binding of 125I-IGF-I in transport experiments. Fig.5 (inset) shows a diagram of the transport apparatus. The 125I-IGF-I was added at the start of the experiment to the “upstream” compartment, allowed to diffuse through the 400-μm-thick cartilage discs, and the effluent radioactivity monitored in the “downstream” compartment. A total of nine transport experiments were carried out with very reproducible trends. Fig. 5 shows a representative experiment in which the efflux of125I-IGF-I into the downstream bath (as a percentage to the total added to the upstream compartment) is plotted as a function of time. The time lag (τlag) before effluent counts were observed after addition of 125I-IGF-I to the upstream compartment was calculated to be 266 min, using the intercept on the time axis for the line fit to the first steady state (linear) portion of the data (t = 400–620 min). In general, the time lag reflects the combined diffusion-reaction transport process governing emergence of a solute into the downstream bath (21.Crank J. The Mathematics of Diffusion. Clarendon Press, Oxford1975Google Scholar). In this case, the lag would include the time that it takes for endogenous IGF sites to be saturated with the radiolabeled growth factor, after which a steady state rate of 125I-IGF-I diffusion is seen between 400 and 620 min. The diffusivity for IGF-I calculated from this steady state flux was 4.1 × 10−7 cm2/s (calculation of this diffusivity took into account the small amount of residual low molecular weight iodinated species in the125I-IGF-I preparation, by means of separate control experiments as described in detail by Garcia et al. (14.Garcia A.M. Lark M.W. Trippel S.B. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Orthopaedic Res. 1998; 16: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)). The diffusivity was used to estimate the τlag that would be expected in the absence of binding (21.Crank J. The Mathematics of Diffusion. Clarendon Press, Oxford1975Google Scholar). This theoretical τlag is 11 min, 24-fold faster than experimentally observed, strongly suggesting that transport of IGF-I through these cartilage discs was dramatically slowed by bindi"
https://openalex.org/W2063812024,"We have used a range of complementary biochemical and biophysical methods to investigate the interactions between nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2), the Ras family GTPase Ran, andXFXFG nucleoporin repeats that are crucial for nuclear trafficking. Microcalorimetry, microtiter plate binding, and fluorescence quenching in solution are all consistent with the binding constant for the NTF2-RanGDP interaction being in the 100 nm range, whereas the interaction between NTF2 andXFXFG repeat-containing nucleoporins such as Nsp1p is in the 1 μm range. Although the accumulation of NTF2 at the nuclear envelope is enhanced by RanGDP, we show that Ran binding does not alter the affinity of NTF2 for nucleoporins nor does the binding of nucleoporins alter the affinity of NTF2 for RanGDP. These results indicate that, instead, Ran increases the binding of NTF2 to nucleoporins by another mechanism, most probably by Ran itself binding to nucleoporins and NTF2 binding to this nuclear pore-associated Ran.

Gerace L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 5: 175-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2.Stewart M. Rhodes D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 4: 388-397Google Scholar). In nuclear protein import, for example, Ran is thought to regulate crucial interactions between cargo and carrier molecules in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Thus, cargo proteins carrying nuclear localization signals bind to carrier molecules of the importin-β family in the cytoplasm and are then translocated into the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes, after which the carrier-cargo complex is dissociated by RanGTP. The carrier is then recycled to the cytoplasm bound to RanGTP, where RanGTPase-activating protein generates RanGDP, which dissociates from the carrier freeing it to interact with another cargo molecule and so undergo a further import cycle (3.Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The cycling of carriers between nucleus and cytoplasm and their binding and release of cargo molecules in the appropriate compartment is thus intimately tied to Ran nucleotide state, with RanGDP being generated in the cytoplasm by RanGTPase-activating protein and Ran being recharged with GTP in the nucleus by its guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 (1.Melchior F. Gerace L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 5: 175-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (126) Google Scholar). RanGTP is being continuously exported from the nucleus and must be recycled back to the nucleus for exchange. HeLa cells contain 7 μm Ran, being mainly nuclear (4.Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10830-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The nuclear import of RanGDP is mediated by NTF2,1a small dimeric protein that binds both RanDGP and to a number of nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins) that contain tandem sequence repeats based on a series of core XFXFG motifs joined by variable hydrophilic linkers (5.Moore M.S.

Biol. 1999; 293: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Although the interactions between RanGDP, NTF2, andXFXFG nucleoporins are essential for mediating the nuclear import of RanGDP, there is little quantitative information on the strength of these interactions or how they are modulated and orchestrated. We have therefore used a range of biochemical methods to assess these interactions and here show the strength of the interaction between NTF2-Ran to be in the 100 nm range, whereas that between NTF2 and the XFXFG repeats of a representative nucleoporin Nsp1p is in the micromolar range. We also show that the presence of Ran does not affect the strength of the interaction between NTF2 and the Nsp1 XFXFG repeats; conversely, the presence of Nsp1 does not affect the interaction between Ran and NTF2. The results obtained on purified proteins contrast with observations on permeabilized cells, where RanGDP increased the accumulation of NTF2 at the nuclear envelope (14.Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Görlich M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, this effect is not seen with R76E-Ran, which does not bind NTF2 (16.Kent H.M. Moore M.S. Quimby B.B. Baker A.M.E. McCoy A.J. Murphy G.A. Corbett A.H. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), indicating that accumulation of NTF2 at the nuclear envelope is mediated through a direct Ran-NTF2 interaction. The different models accounting for these results are evaluated.DISCUSSIONThe results using three separate methods were broadly comparable giving a K d value in the order of 100 nm(Fig. 1) for the RanGDP-NTF2 interaction. Although the microtiter plate assay gave a slightly weaker interaction (by 2- or 3-fold), this difference was probably not significant as the standard deviations obtained with this assay were quite large. It was therefore reassuring that two different assays (microplate and solution fluorescence quenching) gave comparable results. Similar K dvalues were obtained for canine Ran and the yeast homologue Gsp1, whereas addition of sequences at the Ran N terminus such as the S and His tags decreased the affinity of RanGDP for NTF2 by a factor not more than 2. The on-rate association between NTF2 and Ran GDP would be expected to be in the range 107 to 108s−1m−1 (23.Berg O.G. Von Hippel P.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1985; 14: 131-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), and so a 100 nm K d would imply an off-rate of the order of 1–10/s, which is somewhat slower than the rate of nuclear trafficking, which is thought to be of the order of 10–100/s. Thus, the binding constant for the NTF2-RanGDP complex is sufficiently strong to ensure that the complex remains intact during nuclear import but sufficiently weak for it to dissociate on a time scale rapid relative to nucleotide exchange once in the nucleus. Moreover, combined with the likely concentrations of Ran and NTF2, a K d in the 100 nm range indicated that, whereas RanGDP would be expected to be only partially complexed in the cytoplasm and nucleus, at the nuclear envelope (primarily in nuclear pore complexes) virtually all the RanGDP present should be complexed with NTF2 (Table I). Two implications for nuclear import can be drawn from those results. First, the stable nature of the complex between RanGDP and NTF2 (off-rate of the order of 1–10/s) would mean that the complex probably stays intact during trafficking. Second, the higher local concentration of NTF2 at the NE implies that 99% of the Ran present at the NE would be found in such a complex; hence, even if dissociation of RanGDP from the NTF2-Ran complex would occur, the reassociation would occur quickly. Those conclusions are consistent with a model for the nuclear import of Ran that would cross the NE in complex with NTF2 (Fig. 6).The affinity of NTF2 for the Nsp1 repeats is weaker than that between NTF2 and Ran and was of the order of 25 μm based on the concentration of individual XFXFG repeats (Fig.3). However, this lower affinity does not preclude the possibility of this interaction to occur in vivo at the NPC, since theXFXFG repeats are present in high copies number on several nucleoporins at the NE and therefore their local concentration is expected to be high, probably of the order of 50 mm (15.Bayliss R. Ribbeck K. Akin D. Kent H.M. Feldherr C.M. Görlich D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The off-rate for the NTF2/Nsp1 interaction has been estimated to be in the order of 500–5000/s for an individual repeat (15.Bayliss R. Ribbeck K. Akin D. Kent H.M. Feldherr C.M. Görlich D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), implying that this interaction would be more transient than that between NTF2 and RanGDP. This would allow rapid attachment and detachment of NTF2 to the nucleoporins. In the context of the more stable interaction between NTF2 and Ran, a 25 μm affinity of NTF2 for nucleoporin XFXFG repeats would also enable rapid attachment and detachment of the RanGDP-NTF2 complex to the nucleoporins during trafficking. Such a mechanism would be consistent with the results showing the crucial importance of a direct interaction with NTF2 for the import of RanGDP (13.Smith A. Brownawell A. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1403-1406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Görlich M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar).Our results showed no synergy between the interactions involving RanGDP, NTF2, and Nsp1. RanGDP had no effect on the affinity of NTF2-Nsp1 interaction, nor did the presence of Nsp1 have an effect on the Ran-NTF2 interaction (Figs. 2 and 3). The crystal structure of NTF2 either free (22.Bullock T.L. Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or in complex with RanGDP (21.Stewart M. Kent H.M. McCoy A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) are certainly consistent with those results, since there is no major conformational changes in the protein backbone resulting from the RanGDP binding on the NTF2 molecule.Previous work using permeabilized cells had shown that Ran increased the accumulation of NTF2 at the nuclear envelope implying a co-operativity between Ran, NTF2, and a constituent of the NPCs (14.Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Görlich M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, our in vitro results with purified proteins do not support such a co-operative role for RanGDP in the NTF2-Nsp1 interaction (Fig. 3). How then can one account for the increased nuclear envelope binding of NTF2 induced by Ran? Certainly, our results (Fig. 4) with R76E-Ran that does not bind to NTF2 (16.Kent H.M. Moore M.S. Quimby B.B. Baker A.M.E. McCoy A.J. Murphy G.A. Corbett A.H. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) indicated that a direct interaction between NTF2 and Ran was required for this effect. Therefore, as illustrated in Fig. 5, either NTF2 is interacting with another type of nucleoporin in a Ran-sensitive manner or NTF2 is binding to RanGDP that is itself bound to the NPC. Thus, in model A, NTF2 binds a non-XFXFG repeat containing nucleoporin with higher affinity when NTF2 is bound to RanGDP (Fig. 5 A). Although results obtained with an NTF2 mutant (W7A-NTF2) with reduced affinity for XFXFG repeat-containing nucleoporins are consistent with this hypothesis (15.Bayliss R. Ribbeck K. Akin D. Kent H.M. Feldherr C.M. Görlich D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), it is controversial whether NTF2 binds to nucleoporins other than those withXFXFG repeats. Although a number of putative bands were seen with gel overlays using gold-NTF2 conjugates (24.Nehrbass U. Blobel G. Science. 1996; 272: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), bead binding and two-hybrid screens have only shown interactions withXFXFG nucleoporins (8.Clarkson W.D. Corbett A.H. Paschal B.M. Kent H.M. McCoy A.J. Gerace L. Silver P.A. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 716-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the NTF2-RanGDP complex could interact with another protein anchored to the NPC (Fig. 5 C), but no stable complex in solution with importin-β (data not shown) nor with transportin-RanGDP-NTF2 complex could be formed (14.Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Görlich M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The most probable model explaining the accumulation of NTF2 upon addition of RanGDP at the NE in the permeabilized cell assay would then be that illustrated in Fig.5 B, where Ran associated with a nucleoporin also binds NTF2 (with the possibility that RanGDP and NTF2 might simultaneously bind to the nucleoporin). The nucleoporins RanBP2 and Nup153 have been shown to interact with RanGDP through Zn finger domains (25.Yaseen N.R. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5516-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26.Nakielny S. Shaikh S. Burke B. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1982-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar); moreover, both nucleoporins also contain XFXFG repeats, which are potential binding sites for NTF2.Figure 5Different possible models accounting for the cooperative binding of NTF2 at the nuclear envelope upon Ran addition. In all the models described, N stands for NTF2 and is represented as a dimer, Ran stands for RanGDP, and it is understood that the interaction between RanGDP and NTF2 is essential for the cooperative binding. Nucleoporin X stands for a putative nucleoporin potentially interacting with NTF2 via a different set of interaction from theXFXFG repeat type. The increased accumulation of NTF2 at the NE upon Ran addition could result from an increased affinity of NTF2 for nucleoporin X when NTF2 is bound to Ran (model A). Alternatively, Ran is directly anchoring NTF2 on a nucleoporin with or without simultaneous binding of NTF2 to this nucleoporin (model B), or Ran is anchoring NTF2 to the nucleoporin via an intermediate protein (model C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In summary, the affinity constant for the Ran/NTF2 complex and the NTF2/XFXFG repeat-containing nucleoporins such as Nsp1p complex are 100 nm and 1 μm, respectively. Upon RanGDP binding, there is no alteration for the affinity of NTF2 for nucleoporins. Conversely, upon Nsp1p binding there is no alteration for the affinity of NTF2 for RanGDP. In permeabilized cells, an enhanced accumulation of NTF2 at the NE proceeds through a direct Ran-NTF2 interaction indicating most probably that Ran itself ensures the binding of NTF2 to nucleoporins via a nuclear pore-associated Ran. The Ras family GTPase Ran is a key component of the nuclear trafficking machinery and is also important in cell cycle progression (1.Melchior F. Gerace L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 5: 175-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2.Stewart M. Rhodes D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 4: 388-397Google Scholar). In nuclear protein import, for example, Ran is thought to regulate crucial interactions between cargo and carrier molecules in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Thus, cargo proteins carrying nuclear localization signals bind to carrier molecules of the importin-β family in the cytoplasm and are then translocated into the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes, after which the carrier-cargo complex is dissociated by RanGTP. The carrier is then recycled to the cytoplasm bound to RanGTP, where RanGTPase-activating protein generates RanGDP, which dissociates from the carrier freeing it to interact with another cargo molecule and so undergo a further import cycle (3.Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The cycling of carriers between nucleus and cytoplasm and their binding and release of cargo molecules in the appropriate compartment is thus intimately tied to Ran nucleotide state, with RanGDP being generated in the cytoplasm by RanGTPase-activating protein and Ran being recharged with GTP in the nucleus by its guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 (1.Melchior F. Gerace L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 5: 175-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (126) Google Scholar). RanGTP is being continuously exported from the nucleus and must be recycled back to the nucleus for exchange. HeLa cells contain 7 μm Ran, being mainly nuclear (4.Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10830-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The nuclear import of RanGDP is mediated by NTF2,1a small dimeric protein that binds both RanDGP and to a number of nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins) that contain tandem sequence repeats based on a series of core XFXFG motifs joined by variable hydrophilic linkers (5.Moore M.S. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 6.Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J.

Biol. 1997; 272: 716-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). NTF2 is localized primarily to the nuclear rim (9.Feldherr C. Akin D. Moore M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1889-1896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Yamada M. Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Curr.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21534-21539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and studies using engineered mutants of both Ran and NTF2 have shown that both the NTF2-RanGDP and NTF2-XFXFG repeat interactions are required for efficient nuclear import of Ran (13.Smith A. Brownawell A. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1403-1406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Görlich M.

Biol. 1999; 293: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although the interactions between RanGDP, NTF2, andXFXFG nucleoporins are essential for mediating the nuclear import of RanGDP, there is little quantitative information on the strength of these interactions or how they are modulated and orchestrated. We have therefore used a range of biochemical methods to assess these interactions and here show the strength of the interaction between NTF2-Ran to be in the 100 nm range, whereas that between NTF2 and the XFXFG repeats of a representative nucleoporin Nsp1p is in the micromolar range. We also show that the presence of Ran does not affect the strength of the interaction between NTF2 and the Nsp1 XFXFG repeats; conversely, the presence of Nsp1 does not affect the interaction between Ran and NTF2. The results obtained on purified proteins contrast with observations on permeabilized cells, where RanGDP increased the accumulation of NTF2 at the nuclear envelope (14.Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Görlich M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, this effect is not seen with R76E-Ran, which does not bind NTF2 (16.Kent H.M. Moore M.S. Quimby B.B. Baker A.M.E. McCoy A.J. Murphy G.A. Corbett A.H. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), indicating that accumulation of NTF2 at the nuclear envelope is mediated through a direct Ran-NTF2 interaction. The different models accounting for these results are evaluated. DISCUSSIONThe results using three separate methods were broadly comparable giving a K d value in the order of 100 nm(Fig. 1) for the RanGDP-NTF2 interaction. Although the microtiter plate assay gave a slightly weaker interaction (by 2- or 3-fold), this difference was probably not significant as the standard deviations obtained with this assay were quite large. It was therefore reassuring that two different assays (microplate and solution fluorescence quenching) gave comparable results. Similar K dvalues were obtained for canine Ran and the yeast homologue Gsp1, whereas addition of sequences at the Ran N terminus such as the S and His tags decreased the affinity of RanGDP for NTF2 by a factor not more than 2. The on-rate association between NTF2 and Ran GDP would be expected to be in the range 107 to 108s−1m−1 (23.Berg O.G. Von Hippel P.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1985; 14: 131-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), and so a 100 nm K d would imply an off-rate of the order of 1–10/s, which is somewhat slower than the rate of nuclear trafficking, which is thought to be of the order of 10–100/s. Thus, the binding constant for the NTF2-RanGDP complex is sufficiently strong to ensure that the complex remains intact during nuclear import but sufficiently weak for it to dissociate on a time scale rapid relative to nucleotide exchange once in the nucleus. Moreover, combined with the likely concentrations of Ran and NTF2, a K d in the 100 nm range indicated that, whereas RanGDP would be expected to be only partially complexed in the cytoplasm and nucleus, at the nuclear envelope (primarily in nuclear pore complexes) virtually all the RanGDP present should be complexed with NTF2 (Table I). Two implications for nuclear import can be drawn from those results. First, the stable nature of the complex between RanGDP and NTF2 (off-rate of the order of 1–10/s) would mean that the complex probably stays intact during trafficking. Second, the higher local concentration of NTF2 at the NE implies that 99% of the Ran present at the NE would be found in such a complex; hence, even if dissociation of RanGDP from the NTF2-Ran complex would occur, the reassociation would occur quickly. Those conclusions are consistent with a model for the nuclear import of Ran that would cross the NE in complex with NTF2 (Fig. 6).The affinity of NTF2 for the Nsp1 repeats is weaker than that between NTF2 and Ran and was of the order of 25 μm based on the concentration of individual XFXFG repeats (Fig.3). However, this lower affinity does not preclude the possibility of this interaction to occur in vivo at the NPC, since theXFXFG repeats are present in high copies number on several nucleoporins at the NE and therefore their local concentration is expected to be high, probably of the order of 50 mm (15.Bayliss R. Ribbeck K. Akin D. Kent H.M. Feldherr C.M. Görlich D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The off-rate for the NTF2/Nsp1 interaction has been estimated to be in the order of 500–5000/s for an individual repeat (15.Bayliss R. Ribbeck K. Akin D. Kent H.M. Feldherr C.M. Görlich D.

However, our in vitro results with purified proteins do not support such a co-operative role for RanGDP in the NTF2-Nsp1 interaction (Fig. 3). How then can one account for the increased nuclear envelope binding of NTF2 induced by Ran? Certainly, our results (Fig. 4) with R76E-Ran that does not bind to NTF2 (16.Kent H.M. Moore M.S. Quimby B.B. Baker A.M.E. McCoy A.J. Murphy G.A. Corbett A.H. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) indicated that a direct interaction between NTF2 and Ran was required for this effect. Therefore, as illustrated in Fig. 5, either NTF2 is interacting with another type of nucleoporin in a Ran-sensitive manner or NTF2 is binding to RanGDP that is itself bound to the NPC. Thus, in model A, NTF2 binds a non-XFXFG repeat containing nucleoporin with higher affinity when NTF2 is bound to RanGDP (Fig. 5 A). Although results obtained with an NTF2 mutant (W7A-NTF2) with reduced affinity for XFXFG repeat-containing nucleoporins are consistent with this hypothesis (15.Bayliss R. Ribbeck K. Akin D. Kent H.M. Feldherr C.M. Görlich D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), it is controversial whether NTF2 binds to nucleoporins other than those withXFXFG repeats. Although a number of putative bands were seen with gel overlays using gold-NTF2 conjugates (24.Nehrbass U. Blobel G. Science. 1996; 272: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), bead binding and two-hybrid screens have only shown interactions withXFXFG nucleoporins (8.Clarkson W.D. Corbett A.H. Paschal B.M. Kent H.M. McCoy A.J. Gerace L. Silver P.A. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 716-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the NTF2-RanGDP complex could interact with another protein anchored to the NPC (Fig. 5 C), but no stable complex in solution with importin-β (data not shown) nor with transportin-RanGDP-NTF2 complex could be formed (14.Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Görlich M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The most probable model explaining the accumulation of NTF2 upon addition of RanGDP at the NE in the permeabilized cell assay would then be that illustrated in Fig.5 B, where Ran associated with a nucleoporin also binds NTF2 (with the possibility that RanGDP and NTF2 might simultaneously bind to the nucleoporin). The nucleoporins RanBP2 and Nup153 have been shown to interact with RanGDP through Zn finger domains (25.Yaseen N.R. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5516-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26.Nakielny S. Shaikh S. Burke B. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1982-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar); moreover, both nucleoporins also contain XFXFG repeats, which are potential binding sites for NTF2. In summary, the affinity constant for the Ran/NTF2 complex and the NTF2/XFXFG repeat-containing nucleoporins such as Nsp1p complex are 100 nm and 1 μm, respectively. Upon RanGDP binding, there is no alteration for the affinity of NTF2 for nucleoporins. Conversely, upon Nsp1p binding there is no alteration for the affinity of NTF2 for RanGDP. In permeabilized cells, an enhanced accumulation of NTF2 at the NE proceeds through a direct Ran-NTF2 interaction indicating most probably that Ran itself ensures the binding of NTF2 to nucleoporins via a nuclear pore-associated Ran. We are most grateful to our colleagues in Cambridge, especially Helen Kent, Richard Bayliss, Alan Weeds, Tim Dafforn, and James Huntington for their many helpful comments and criticisms."

Constitutively active Ras mutants are frequently detected in human tumors and expression of mutated, oncogenic Ras in cultured rodent fibroblast cell lines induces alterations in cell morphology, loss of contact inhibition, changes in gene expression, decreased dependence on serum growth factors, and proliferation which is independent of adhesion to a substratum. Data accumulated during the past decade have shown that many of these Ras-promoted cellular transactions are mediated by Ras effectors, among which Rho family members play an important role, linking plasma membrane receptors to the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, aggregation, motility, and proliferation (3.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). The Rho family of small GTPases include various isoforms of Rac (1.Philips A. Huet X. Plet A. Rech J. Vie A. Blanchard J.M.

Like Ras, these GTPases oscillate between an active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound forms (4.Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Transient binding of guanine nucleotides is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, GTPase-activating proteins, and GDP dissociation inhibitory factors (5.Lamarche N. Hall A.

In fibroblasts, Rho regulates the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers, Rac mediates membrane ruffles and lamellipodia, and Cdc42Hs controls the formation of filopodia (8.Ridley A.J.

Furthermore, Rac1 and Cdc42Hs have been shown to modulate the activity of the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1 and p38 stress-activated protein kinase signaling pathways (12.Coso O.A.

It has now become evident that Rho family proteins, in addition to regulating the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, play an important role in the control of cell proliferation (14.Olson M.F.

RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 have been implicated in the regulation of transcription (16.Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R.

Expression of activated forms of RhoA and Rac can transform fibroblasts and is essential for the establishment of a fully transformed phenotype following Ras activation (18.Khosravi-Far R.

Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). While these results suggest that RhoA and Rac may act downstream of Ras in the control of cell proliferation, the role of Cdc42Hs in this respect still remains unclear. Expression of an activated form of Cdc42 induces progression of adherent quiescent fibroblasts into S phase (14.Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). However, Cdc42Hs has also been shown to inhibit cell cycle progression through a mechanism requiring p38 activation in NIH 3T3 cells (22.Molnar A. Theodoras A.M. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13229-13235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Cdc42Hs has also been implicated in the control of anchorage-independent growth (23.Qiu R.G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Indeed, the ability of Ras expressing fibroblastic cell lines to proliferate in soft agar depends on Cdc42 activity (23.Qiu R.G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of anchorage-independent growth control, modulated by Cdc42 and Ras are unknown. Extracellular signal response kinase (ERK) activation is not a limiting factor in this response (24.Le Gall M. Grall D. Chambard J.C. Pouyssegur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1271-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but a potential implication of the JNK/p38 stress-activated protein kinase signaling pathways remain to be established. Most studies of the mechanisms underlying the control of anchorage-independent cell proliferation have been conducted on immortal or transformed cell lines in which many regulatory loops are altered as a consequence of the adaptation of the cells to in vitro culture. Alteration of these checkpoints might thus explain the existence of many apparent cell type-specific differences. Another important source of variability stems from the various experimental settings used for the study of anchorage-proliferation relationships. The ability of cells to form colonies within soft agar does not necessarily correlate with their ability to proliferate under other anchorage-free conditions, such as in liquid suspension on agar-coated dishes (24.Le Gall M. Grall D. Chambard J.C. Pouyssegur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1271-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we have evaluated the role and putative interplay between Ras, RhoA, RhoG, Rac1, and Cdc42 on anchorage-independent proliferation of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) in liquid medium. Expression of cyclin A is required for fibroblast proliferation. Through its association with cyclin-dependent protein kinases cdc2/cdk1 and cdk2, cyclin A controls the normal progression through the S phase and the G2/M transition. Even in the presence of growth factors, fibroblasts cultured without substratum contact fail to express cyclin A and, as a consequence, do not enter S phase. However, this situation can be overcome by ectopic expression of cyclin A. Since cyclin A expression is a marker of cell competence for proliferation, we assessed the role of the Rho GTPases in mediating proliferation in the absence of adhesion, through activation of cyclin A transcriptional activity. In the experiments reported here, we show that the anchorage requirement for cyclin A expression and subsequent cell cycle progression of MEF are alleviated by ectopic expression of the activated forms of either Ras or Cdc42, but not by Rac1, RhoA, or RhoG. Anchorage-independent proliferation is promoted by a synergy between Ras and Cdc42, thereby delineating two distinct signaling pathways. Finally, the level of p38 kinase activity seems to be a key regulator of anchorage-independent proliferation. Early primary MEF were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate procedure, cultured for 24 h in the presence of serum on agar-coated dishes, and processed for luciferase activity as described previously (1.Philips A. Huet X. Plet A. Rech J. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1819-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Normalization was performed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system from Promega. When required, cells were analyzed according to their DNA content with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) after labeling with propidium iodide. The following plasmids were used: pCycA-luc is a pGL2-Basic vector containing murine cyclin A promoter sequences spanning nucleotides −177 to +100 relative to the 3′ most transcription initiation site; pDCR-Ras (Val-12) is pDCR-based vector containing the Ras mutant under the control of the early cytomegalovirus promoter (gift from M. White); Myc epitope-tagged Rac-1, Cdc42Hs, RhoA, and their various mutants were obtained from Ph. Chavrier and expressed in pcDNA3. Expression vectors for wild type HA-tagged JNK1 (pSRα.3HA.JNK1), its dominant negative form (pcDNA3-HA-JNK1-APF), and wild type HA-ERK2 (pECE-HA-p44 MAPK) were gifts from A. Debant and B. Derijard. Wild type HA-p38 MAPK and its dominant negative form, HA-p38 MAPK-TA-YF, were expressed in a PECE-based expression vector (gift from A. Brunet). pCMV-WASP-GBD was constructed by insertion of anEcoRI-XhoI fragment of pGEX-KG-WASP (gift from A. Hall) into the same sites of pMYCS1 (gift from C. Sardet). As a result, the Cdc42-interacting domain of WASP extending from amino acid 201 to 321, is cloned in-frame with an upstream Myc-tag located between theNcoI and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3. 5 μg of total DNA was used for 105 cells per 3.5-cm diameter Petri dishes (0.5 μg of pCycA-luc, 0.1 μg of pRL-TK, expression vector as indicated in each figure legend and pBluescript SKII+ for a total amount of 5 μg). To label cells with BrdUrd, MEF were cultured during 12 h in suspension and BrdUrd was then added for an additional 12 h. Cells were collected and fixed on glass slides before BrdUrd staining was monitored. After co-transfection of vectors expressing the various tagged MAP kinases and the small GTPases together with pCycA-luc, MEF were cultured for 24 h in the absence of adhesion. Cells were then lysed in Triton lysis buffer (TLB) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptine as described (2.Roux P. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Doucet-Brutin S. Fort P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 629-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Soluble extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C and split into two fractions. The first one was used to test the expression of the tagged proteins, and the second to assay for ERK2, JNK1, or p38 activities. Extracts were incubated with 5 μl of the 12CA5 anti-HA monoclonal antibody pre-bound to 20 μl of protein-Sepharose G (Amesham Pharmacia Biotech). After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with TLB and twice with kinase buffer containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreithiol, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4. Immunocomplex kinase assays were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of 50 μm ATP and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 20 μl of kinase buffer using 4 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma), GST-cJun (amino acids 1–79), and GST-ATF2 (amino acids 1–110) as substrates for ERK2, JNK1, and p38 kinase activities, respectively. Reactions were stopped with Laemmli sample buffer and the products resolved by gel electrophoresis through 10% (JNK1 and p38) or 15% (ERK2) polyacrylamide SDS-containing gels. Dried gels were exposed on imaging plates for 1 h, and signals were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Western blot analysis were carried out on total cellular extracts after transfer onto nitrocellulose filters, and ECL detection was performed with the following primary antibodies: cyclin A CY-A1, Myc 9E10 (Sigma), and HA12CA5 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) mouse monoclonals, as well as an anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase polyclonal rabbit IgG (1.Philips A. Huet X. Plet A. Rech J. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1819-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts lacking contact with the extracellular matrix are arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, as can be judged by most of the cells having a 2n DNA content and expressing cyclin D1 to a high level (data not shown) (25.Guadagno T.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is well established that Rho family proteins play an essential role both in organizing the actin cytoskeleton (26.Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) and in promoting cell cycle progression in adherent cells (14.Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). We have investigated the effects of four Rho family members (RhoA, RhoG, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs) on cyclin A expression and S phase entry of nonadherent fibroblasts. The activated Myc-tagged mutants of the GTPases were co-expressed in transient transfection experiments with a transfected cyclin A promoter-driven luciferase reporter (pCycA-luc). In nonadherent MEFs, a constitutively activated form of Cdc42Hs (Cdc42Hs (Val-12) or Cdc42Hs (Leu-61)) activated pCycA-luc (Fig.1 A). In contrast, RhoA (Val-14), RhoG (Val-12), and Rac1 (Val-12) failed to stimulate the cyclin A-promoter (Fig. 1 A). However, in a parallel experiment, Cdc42Hs, and to a lesser extent RhoA (Val-14) and Rac1 (Val-12), activated serum responsive element-driven transcription (Fig.1 B). We next investigated whether activated Rho proteins modulated the endogenous cyclin A expression in nonadherent MEF. We therefore analyzed endogenous cyclin A expression in nonadherent cells transfected with activated forms of Cdc42Hs, Rac1, and RhoG. The different mutants were expressed at the same level as monitored by Western blot analysis performed with a monoclonal antibody directed against the Myc epitope (Fig.2 A). Nevertheless, activation of Cdc42Hs, but not RhoG nor Rac1, resulted in a significant expression of endogenous cyclin A in nonadherent MEF. Consistent with these data, BrdUrd labeling (Fig. 2 B) indicative of S phase entry, were detected only in cells expressing activated Cdc42Hs. Moreover, using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, we confirmed that these nonadherent MEF cells were competent for cell cycle progression since they accumulated in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (data not shown).Figure 2Activated Cdc42 (Val-12) and not Rac1 (Val-12) nor RhoG (Val-12), induces cyclin A expression and S phase reentry of nonadherent MEF. Fibroblasts were transiently transfected as indicated in Fig. 1. A, expression of cyclin A together with the various Myc-tagged GTPases mutants was monitored by Western blotting on total cellular extracts performed successively with anticyclin A and anti-Myc monoclonals. Normalization was carried out with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) rabbit polyclonal antibody. pcDNA3 indicates cells transfected with the empty vector. B, cells entering S phase were detected after BrdUrd incorporation by immunostaining with a fluorescein-conjugated anti BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A representative field is shown for each transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Experiments aimed at determining whether Cdc42Hs is a key downstream mediator of Ras signaling have led to conflicting results. Thus we investigated in primary fibroblasts whether Ras was necessary for the resumption of cell proliferation as measured by cyclin A expression. MEF were transfected with cytomegalovirus-driven plasmid expressing the HA-tagged mutant of Ras which contains the activating Val-12 mutation. As shown in Fig. 3 A, Ras (Val-12) gave rise to a 5-fold increase in cyclin A promoter activity. We next investigated the effect of Ras (Val-12) on endogenous cyclin A expression. Whereas cyclin A was not expressed in nonadherent cells transfected with the empty vector (pDCR) following exposure to serum, introduction of Ras (Val-12) resulted in the accumulation of endogenous cyclin A protein (Fig. 3 B). As a consequence, cells entered S phase as monitored by BrdUrd staining (Fig. 3 C) and progressed through cell cycle as observed using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (data not shown). We next examined whether Cdc42Hs and Ras stimulate cyclin A expression through activation of the same signaling cascade. The dominant negative Asn-17 mutant form of Cdc42Hs did not block Ras (Val-12) induced cyclin A promoter activity in nonadherent MEF (Fig. 4 A). Importantly, the dominant negative Asn-17 Rac mutant inhibited the Ras effect by 50% but did not alter the Cdc42Hs response (Fig.4 A). The latter result is consistent with previous data suggesting that pathways downstream of Rac1 are required for full Ras signaling (18.Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 19.Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J.

McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). To address whether Cdc42Hs mediates Ras-induced cyclin A transcription in nonadherent MEF, we used the Cdc42Hs-interacting domain of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), a specific effector for Cdc42Hs involved in actin polymerization (27.Aspenstrom P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28.Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). This fragment inhibits Cdc42Hs activity through competition with its effector binding site. Cdc42Hs, but not Ras (Val-12), induced cyclin A transcription was strongly inhibited upon expression of the WASP fragment (Fig. 4 A). These results suggest that Ras and Cdc42Hs govern different pathways leading to adhesion-independent cyclin A induction. To determine whether Ras and Cdc42Hs activate co-operative pathways, we concomitantly expressed activated forms of Ras and Cdc42Hs, in nonadherent MEF cells. Separately, Ras (Val-12) and Cdc42Hs (Leu-61) activated cyclin A reporter activity to approximately the same extent (5-fold), whereas their co-expression affected cyclin A in a synergistic manner (15-fold) (Fig. 4 B). In conclusion, these data suggest that Cdc42Hs and Ras cooperate to control anchorage-independent proliferation of MEF through parallel pathways.Figure 4Cdc42Hs (Leu-61) and Ras (Val-12) delineate two different pathways that cooperate to induce cyclin A transcription in nonadherent MEF. Fibroblasts were transiently transfected by the indicated combinations of expression plasmids with a cyclin A luciferase reporter, as described in the other figures. A,Ras (Val-12) or Cdc42Hs (Leu-61) were expressed in conjunction with either the empty pCDNA3 vector or the negative dominant forms of Cdc42, Rac1, or the WASP GTPase-binding domain (WASP GBD). In each case the measured luciferase activity is represented relative to that obtained with the empty vector. B, Cdc42Hs (Leu-61) was expressed alone or together with either Ras (Val-12).

Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed whether adhesion-independent cyclin A induction required the activation of any of these MAP kinases. MEF were transiently co-transfected with different combinations of HA-tagged versions of ERK2, p38, or JNK1 together with Ras (Val-12), Cdc42Hs (Leu-61), or Rac1 (Leu-61). As shown in Fig.5 A, Ras (Val-12) activated ERK and, to a much lesser extent, JNK in adherent cells. P38 activity was not induced by Ras (Val-12). In contrast, both Cdc42Hs (Leu-61) and Rac1 (Leu-61) had negligible effects on ERK activity whereas they activated p38 and JNK kinases. When the same experiment was carried out on nonadherent cells, Ras (Val-12) still activated ERK, albeit to a lower extent and had negligible effects on JNK. Interestingly, in a nonadherent context, the basal level of p38 activity was inhibited by Ras (Val-12) (Fig. 5 B) and Cdc42Hs (Leu-61)- or Rac1 (Leu-61)-induced ERK and JNK activities were equivalent in adherent and nonadherent cells. Importantly, the Cdc42Hs-induced activation of p38 was significantly decreased in nonadherent cells as compared with adherent MEF (Fig. 5 A). In an attempt to identify the effector(s) involved, we used previously described Cdc42Hs and Rac1 variants, mutated in their effector domains, which are impaired in binding to specific effectors (30.Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Based on the work carried out on Ras, single amino acids substitutions were introduced within the effector loops of the constitutively active Cdc42Hs (Leu-61) and Rac1 (Leu-61) (30.Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The resulting Cdc42Hs (Q61L/Y40C) and Rac1 (Q61L/Y40C) mutants no longer interact with some Cdc42Hs or Rac-interactive binding motif-containing proteins such as the Ser/Thr protein kinase p65PAK or WASP (30.Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In contrast, the F37A substitution in Cdc42Hs (Q61L/F37A) and Rac1 (Q61L/F37A) does not affect the interactions with Cdc42Hs or Rac-interactive binding domain-containing proteins, but Cdc42Hs (Q61L/F37A) lacks the ability to activate Rac1 (30.Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The experiments described above were repeated with these two Cdc42Hs (Leu-61) effector loop mutants. As expected, the Cdc42Hs (Q61L/Y40C) mutant did not induce JNK while the Cdc42Hs (Q61L/F37A) mutant weakly, but reproducibly, activated JNK (Fig.6 A). Neither form induced p38 activity in nonadherent cells (Fig. 6 B). Importantly, the Cdc42Hs (Q61L/F37A) mutant was almost as potent as Ras (Val-12) or Cdc42Hs (Leu-61) in inducting cyclin A promoter activity after transient expression in nonadherent cells (Fig. 6 C). Moreover, Cdc42Hs (Q61L/F37A) cooperated with Ras (Val-12) to the same level as Cdc42Hs (Leu-61). One interpretation of these results is that Cdc42Hs induced JNK activity is required for cell cycle progression. To test this hypothesis, the dominant negative mutant of JNK (APF-JNK) was expressed in nonadherent cells. Although this dominant negative mutant abolished Cdc42Hs (Leu-61)-induced JNK activity (Fig.7 A), it did not inhibit Cdc42Hs-induced cyclin A expression (Fig. 7 B). These data clearly demonstrate that JNK is not involved in Cdc42Hs-induced anchorage-independent proliferation. Whereas Rac1 (Leu-61) was as potent as Cdc42Hs (Leu-61) in activating JNK, it did not induce cyclin A expression in nonadherent MEF. Interestingly, in contrast with Rac1 (Leu-61), Cdc42Hs did not activate p38 kinase in nonadherent cells (Fig. 5). Moreover, Ras (Val-12), which induced cyclin A expression in nonadherent MEF, strongly down-regulated p38 activity (Fig. 5). We therefore investigated whether the absence of p38 kinase activation was necessary for cyclin A expression in nonadherent MEF, and in particular, whether the ability of Rac1 to activate the p38 pathway could explain its inability to promote cyclin A expression. To test this hypothesis, Rac1 (Leu-61) effector loop mutants were transiently co-transfected into nonadherent MEF expressing HA-tagged versions of p38 or JNK. Rac1 (Q61L/F37A) activated both JNK and p38 kinases, while Rac1 (Q61L/Y40C) had no effect on JNK, and a reduced effect on p38 (Fig. 8, A and B). We next expressed these mutants with the cyclin A-luciferase reporter in nonadherent MEF. As previously observed for Rac1 (Leu-61), neither Rac1 (Q61L/F37A) nor Rac1 (Q61L/Y40C) were able to activate cyclin A promoter activity (Figs. 1 A and 8 C). However, addition of SB203580, a specific inhibitor of the p38 pathway (31.Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Gum R.J. Hand A.T. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 32.Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Kassis S. Doyle M.L. McNulty D. Gallagher T.F. Fisher S. McDonnell P.C. Carr S.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12116-12121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), resulted in strong cyclin A promoter activity in nonadherent Rac1 (Leu-61)-expressing cells (Fig. 8 C). Indeed, cyclin A expression was as high as that observed in the presence of Cdc42Hs (Leu-61). Similarly, the Rac1 double mutant (Rac1 (Q61L/F37A)) impaired in inducing actin polymerization and focal complex formation (30.Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), activated cylin A transcription upon inhibition of the p38 pathway (Fig. 8 C). In contrast, the Rac1 (Q61L/Y40C) mutant did not activate cyclin A transcription under these conditions (Fig.8 C). This strongly suggests that inactivation of p38 kinase activity is required for the suppression of the block to proliferation as measured by activation of cyclin A transcription. This hypothesis is supported by experiments with a dominant negative form of p38 (YFp38), which led to an activation of cyclin A promoter activity when expressed in conjunction with Rac1 (Leu-61) (Fig. 8 C). In conclusion, inactivation of p38 pathway is required, but not sufficient, for the proliferation of nonadherent MEF. Therefore, anchorage-independent MEF proliferation might result from a dynamic balance involving inactivation of p38 kinase activity and activation of an effector distinct from JNK which interacts with Cdc42Hs. Fibroblasts require both mitogens and integrin-mediated attachment for growth (26.Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 33.Assoian R.K.

Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). When deprived of anchorage, many adherent cell lines fail to undergo several G1-specific cell cycle-related transitions, even in the presence of growth factors (1.Philips A. Huet X. Plet A. Rech J.

Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, no such studies have been carried out in primary cells. Stable expression of activated Ras or Cdc42Hs in rodent cell lines has been shown to overcome anchorage-dependent requirements to various extents. However, expression of a mutated Ras is known to induce a wide variety of responses including both gene expression and alterations in cellular morphology. Moreover, it has become clear that the great biological diversity observed within existing cell lines can at least in part be accounted for by the large array of integrin combinations which are expressed at the cell surface. As a result, many cell type-specific differences exist between normal and transformed cells, as well as between cell lines whose proliferation is strictly anchorage-dependent. The differences observed in established cell lines are probably the result of adaptive events that have occurred during cell culture. Thus, the use of primary cells as opposed to immortalized cell lines is particularly important for the investigation of pathways controlling anchorage-independent cell proliferation. Moreover, the use of different experimental conditions to study the links between anchorage and proliferation has also led to many apparent discrepancies. Specifically, growth on soft agar is different from growth in liquid suspension. Some mutants, selected for their ability to form colonies in soft agar are unable to proliferate in liquid suspension (24.Le Gall M. Grall D. Chambard J.C. Pouyssegur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1271-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In order to overcome these difficulties, we studied the requirements for anchorage-independent proliferation of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts grown in suspension following transient ectopic expression of activated Ras-related small GTPases. Mutants of Ras, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs were used in order to determine the individual contributions of these proteins in activating the cell cycle machinery. Finally, because cyclin A down-regulation is observed in all suspended cells (1.Philips A. Huet X. Plet A. Rech J. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1819-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 38.Schulze A. Zerfass-Thome K. Berges J. Middendorp S. Jansen-Durr P. Henglein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4632-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we used cyclin A promoter activation as an index of the ability of a cell to resume cell cycle progression following anchorage deprivation. The stable transfection of an activated Cdc42Hs has previously been shown to enable Rat 1 fibroblasts to grow in soft agar and proliferate in nude mice (23.Qiu R.G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Interestingly, coexpression of a dominant negative Cdc42 (Asn-17) inhibited Ras-mediated focus formation, growth in soft agar, and reversion of the transformed phenotype, indicating that Cdc42Hs is necessary for Ras transformation. Following transient transfection in the absence of cell adhesion, Cdc42Hs (Val-12), but not Rac1 (Val-12), RhoA (Val-14), or RhoG (Val-12), activated cyclin A promoter to the same extent as Ras (Val-12). Accordingly, transfected cells entered S phase as measured by BrdUrd labeling. We next addressed the possibility that Cdc42Hs could cooperate with Ras mutant in leading to cellular proliferation in a fully anchorage-independent context. A strong synergy was observed when either of two activated forms of Cdc42, Cdc42Hs (Val-12) or Cdc42Hs (Leu-61) were co-transfected with Ras (Val-12). Importantly, a Cdc42 effector loop mutant (Cdc42Hs (Q61L/F37A)), which is able to interact with Cdc42Hs or Rac-interactive binding motif-containing proteins, synergizes with the Ras mutant. The importance of Cdc42 in this synergy was further demonstrated by an almost complete inhibition of cyclin A promoter activity following coexpression of activated Cdc42 with WASP-GBD. In contrast, neither the dominant negative form Cdc42 (Asn-17) nor WASP-GBD inhibited Ras-induced anchorage independent transcription of cyclin A, suggesting that Ras activates anchorage-independent cell proliferation through a Cdc42Hs-independent pathway. Although expression of the constitutively active Rac1 was clearly not sufficient to induce anchorage-independent transcription of cyclin A, and thus to proliferation, the ability of the dominant negative Asn-17 form of Rac1 to partially inhibit Ras-induced cyclin A expression places it downstream of Ras in this pathway. Conversely, the inability of the Rac1 (Asn-17) to inhibit Cdc42-induced transcription of cyclin A indicates that the role of Cdc42 in transformation appears to be largely independent of Rac (18.Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 20.Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rac and Cdc42Hs have been shown to delineate distinct pathways that cooperate to transform NIH 3T3 cells (2.Roux P. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Doucet-Brutin S. Fort P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 629-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the Cdc42Hs double mutant Cdc42Hs (Q61L/F37A), which is unable to activate Rac (30.Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), was still able to induce cyclin A transcription and cooperate with Ras. These observations suggest that the hierarchy established between Ras, Cdc42, and Rac in the control of cell morphology (40.Allen W.E. Jones G.E. Pollard J.W. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 707-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar) is not necessarily valid for other processes. Altogether, we show that pathways downstream of Rac1 are required for full Ras signaling, but are not required for Cdc42Hs signaling, in controlling cell cycle progression of MEF cultured under anchorage-free conditions. Both Cdc42Hs and Rac (but not Rho) can activate the JNK/SAPK and the p38/HOG MAP kinases cascades in adherent cells (12.Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 13.Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar), thereby affecting gene transcription. JNK phosphorylates c-Jun at serines 63 and 73, and this transcription factor is implicated in G1progression by inducing cyclin D1 expression (42.Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a recent study showed that phosphorylation of serines 63 and 73 of c-Jun was required for protection against UV-induced apoptosis but not for cell proliferation (42.Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Accordingly, JNK activity is not detected in cells growing on a solid support, and in our work cyclin D1 is normally induced and present in nonadherent MEF. Consistent with this, we show here that a dominant negative form of JNK was unable to inhibit Cdc42Hs-induced cyclin A transcription in MEF cultured under anchorage free conditions. In contrast, p38 MAPK activity has been proposed to participate in the control of the G1/S transition of some cells (22.Molnar A. Theodoras A.M. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13229-13235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 43.Wang S. Nath N. Minden A. Chellappan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Whereas it has been previously shown that Cdc42Hs inhibits proliferation of adherent NIH3T3 cells (22.Molnar A. Theodoras A.M. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13229-13235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we show here that it leads to the opposite effect in nonadherent MEFs. Interestingly, however, modulation of p38 kinase activity seems to be instrumental in both situations. In adherent NIH 3T3 cells, inhibition of proliferation is associated with an activation of p38 activity. In contrast, under anchorage-free conditions, we found that Cdc42Hs-mediated cyclin A induction and progression of MEF through G1/S was associated with impaired p38 activity. Moreover, inhibition of p38 activity allowed Rac1-induced cyclin A transcription. These results indicate that Rac1 and Cdc42Hs use distinct pathways to activate p38 kinase. It is clear that inhibition of p38 kinase activity is not sufficient to trigger proliferation, and additional signals modulated by Cdc42Hs or Rac1 are necessary. It has been postulated that these events require actin polymerization and focal complex formation. However, in our study a Rac1 double mutant (Rac1 (Q61L/F37A)), unable to induce either membrane ruffling or the formation of focal complexes (30.Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), was nevertheless able to induce G1 progression when p38 kinase activity was inhibited. In summary, this study indicates a novel role for Cdc42 in the control of anchorage-independent cell cycle progression. Under these conditions, Cdc42 activity results in a down-regulation of p38 MAPK activity and the Cdc42 effector domain is redirected from JNK to another downstream effector. These findings suggest that unravelling the Cdc42Hs signaling cascade will shed some light on the mechanisms by which a cell integrates peripheral cues into a coordinated proliferation program. M.

The biological function of these enzymes may relate to the regulation of extracellular concentrations of nucleotides (e.g. ATP, ADP, UTP) and nucleosides (e.g. adenosine) (2.Zimmermann H. Braun N.

Extracellular nucleotides are known to be released by distinct mechanisms such as exocytosis from platelets (7.Luthje J. Klin. Wochenschr. 1989; 67: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). They may also originate from damaged or dead cells as well as from apparently uninjured cells under such physiological stimuli as shear stress and hypoxia (6.Sévigny J. Beaudoin A.R. Med.

ATP, ADP, adenosine, and UTP act as extracellular signaling substances in essentially all tissues (8.Dubyak G.R. Elmoatassim C. Am. J.

For example, extracellular ATP and ADP are involved in neurotransmission, nociception, control of secretion from a variety of endocrine and exocrine glands, smooth muscle tone, and vascular hemostasis (8.Dubyak G.R. Elmoatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such nucleotides and nucleosides act via purinoceptors. Moreover, the action triggered by ATP on P2-receptors is often opposite of the action triggered by the dephosphorylated derivative on adenosine receptors (10.Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Daly J.W. Harden T.K. Jacobsen K.A. Leff P. Williams M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar). Ectonucleotidases play a critical modulatory role in these signaling pathways. For example, in cd39-deficient mice, a reversible form of platelet P2Y1 receptor desensitization can be observed. We have proposed that ATPDase/cd39 has a role in regulating thrombotic reactions induced at sites of vessel inflammation (11.Enjyoji K. Sévigny J. Lin Y. Frenette P.S. Christie P.D. Esch J.S.A. Imai M. Edelberg J.M. Rayburn H. Lech M. Beeler D.L. Csizmadia E. Wagner D.D. Robson S.C. Rosenberg R.D. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1010-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). ATP is also an indispensable intracellular molecule for all cells, and the liver appears to be the major source of purines for several extrahepatic tissues, such as brain and muscle, that are incapable ofde novo synthesis (12.Murray A.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1971; 40: 811-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 13.Fox I.H. Kelley W.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 655-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 14.Che M.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Ectonucleotidases at the hepatic sinusoid and bile canalicular membrane may therefore play a key role in the critical regulation of nucleotide and nucleoside trafficking and turnover in the liver, in certain extrahepatic tissues and in bile or plasma (15.Che M.X. Gatmaitan Z. Arias I.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Over 4 decades ago, functional ATPases were shown to be associated with bile canalicular plasma membranes by histochemical techniques (16.Novikoff A.B. Essner E. Am. J. Med. 1960; 29: 102-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This activity was subsequently shown to be distinct from the classical ATPase pumps (15.Che M.X. Gatmaitan Z. Arias I.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the relationship of putative canalicular ecto-ATPases and their functional identification as ATPDases remains unclear. The canalicular ecto-ATPase was previously considered to be identical to cCAM105 and closely related proteins like pp120/HA4 and gp110 (17.Lin S.-H. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14408-14414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Lin S.H. Culic O. Flanagan D. Hixson D.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, cCAM has low ATPase biochemical activities and was later identified as a cell adhesion molecule related to carcinoembryonic antigen rather than an ecto-ATPase (19.Knowles A.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Other types of ectonucleotidases are also present in hepatocyte membranes. For example, the ectophosphodiesterase family member PC-1 is expressed on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes, while a closely related protein termed B10 is predominantly canalicular in distribution (20.Scott L.J.

The cloning of CD39 was followed by the identification of a series of related genes denoted as CD39L1 to L4(25.Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Mamm.

Northern blot analysis of various human tissues with the four cloned members of the CD39-like family revealed that two of these genes were expressed in liver, namelyCD39L2 and CD39L4 (27.Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Genomics. 1998; 50: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). CD39L4 has been recently characterized as a soluble ATPDase expressed by macrophages (30.Mulero J.J. Yeung G. Nelken S.T. Ford J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20064-20067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), while CD39L2 has not yet been studied at the protein/biochemical level. Northern blot and immunoblot show that the prototype CD39 is expressed in liver, but at low levels when compared with other tissues (11.Enjyoji K. Sévigny J. Lin Y. Frenette P.S. Christie P.D.

Maliszewski C.R. Zimmermann H. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1189-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), has been shown to be expressed in mouse hepatoma cells induced by the environmental contaminant dioxin (32.Gao L. Dong L.Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15358-15365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CD39L3 is an ATPDase originally found in the brain (28.Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), while the UDPase is localized to the Golgi apparatus (29.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To date, none of these CD39 family members have been localized to the hepatic canaliculus. The goal of this study was to identify the source of this as yet uncharacterized ATPDase activity in liver and to examine the putative enzyme functional properties and distribution. Salts, buffers, nucleotides, diadenosine polyphosphates, FSBA, pristane, and Freund's adjuvant were obtained from Sigma (Bornem, Belgium) and/or from Fisher. Oligomycin, levamisole, EGTA, EDTA, and ouabain (octahydrate) were purchased from Janssen Chimica (Beerse, Belgium). Immobilon-P blotting membranes were from Millipore (Bedford, MA), and ProBlott polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems (Nieuwerkerk a/d IJssel, The Netherlands). Goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were bought from Pierce. Biotin-labeled horse anti-mouse secondary antibodies, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, and the avidin-biotin kit were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA), horseradish peroxidase ABC complex from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark), and the Renaissance Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus from NEN Life Science Products. All cell culture media and consumables were purchased from Life Technologies Inc. (Merelbeke, Belgium). Triton X-100 (purified for membrane research) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). The BCA protein assay was from Pierce, and F96 MaxiSorp Nunc-Immuno 96 well plates were from Nalge Nunc International (Rochester, NY). Plasma membrane-enriched particulate fractions were prepared as described previously (33.Sévigny J. Grondin G. Gendron F.P. Roy J. Beaudoin A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 38: G473-G482Google Scholar). Pig liver particulate fractions used for either capture assay or purification of the hepatic ATPDase (hATPDase) were prepared using a slightly different procedure as described previously. 2Lemmens, R., Kupers, L., Sévigny, J., Beaudoin, A. R., Grondin, G., Kittel, A., Waelkens, E., and Vanduffel, L. (2000) Am. J. Physiol., in press. Particulate fractions were suspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) to about 5 mg of protein/ml and sonicated (MSE Instruments, Leicester, United Kingdom) at 75% of maximal intensity. An equal volume of the same buffer, containing 0.6% Triton X-100 was added and the mixture was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant containing the solubilized membrane proteins was used for further purification. Proteins were deglycosylated with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), as described previously (35.Esch J.S.A. Sévigny J. Kaczmarek E. Siegel J.B. Imai M. Koziak K. Beaudoin A.R. Robson S.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2248-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by Western blotting as detailed below. Partially purified nucleotidase fractions from porcine kidney cortex were injected into mice.2 Hybridomas and monoclonal antibodies were prepared as described previously.2 Hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibody to nucleotidases were selected using an ATPDase capture assay (36.Strobel R.S. Nagy A.K. Knowles A.F. Buegel J. Rosenberg M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16323-163231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) according to Laemmli (37.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein samples were boiled in sample buffer (2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerin, 0.001% bromphenol blue in 65 mm Tris, pH 6.8) under non-reducing conditions. The proteins were separated on a 10% acrylamide SDS-gel and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane by semidry electroblotting (38.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). After incubation with mouse anti-ATPDase monoclonal antibodies, the bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, at a dilution of 1:4,000, and the Renaissance Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Liver, kidney, and other tissues were embedded in freezing medium, snap-frozen in isopentane in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until used. Sections of 5 μm were obtained, air-dried, fixed in acetone, and stained using murine monoclonal antibodies to pig hATPDase (3A1) or ATPDase/cd39 (4D8 or 4D11), as described previously (39.Bach F.H. Ferran C. Soares M. Wrighton C.J. Anrather J. Winkler H. Robson S.C. Hancock W.W. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with 5% normal horse serum. Primary antibodies were detected using biotin-labeled horse anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Endogenous peroxidase activity was previously blocked by an incubation of 9 min in 0.03% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. After several washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the sections were stained with horseradish peroxidase complex as specified by manufacturer's recommendations. Peroxidase activity was revealed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a substrate, as specified by the manufacturer's instructions. Isotype-matched monoclonal antibodies (mouse IgG1) and a control for residual endogenous peroxidase activity were included in each experiment. Typically, 160 mg of solubilized hepatic membrane proteins were incubated with 5 ml of 1/1 (v/v) Sepharose 4B in Tris buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6) for 1 h to exclude nonspecific interactions. The Sepharose was removed by passage through a 0.22-μm membrane filter (Gelman), and the filtrate was applied to an immunoaffinity column prepared with purified monoclonal anti-hATPDase antibody (3A1) conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed consecutively with Tris buffer, the same buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.3% Triton X-100, Tris buffer with 1 m LiCl and 0.3% Triton X-100 and finally H2O, all at flow rates of 1 ml/min. The ATPDase activity was recovered by elution with 3 m NaSCN, 0.3% Triton X-100 in Tris buffer. The eluted fractions with the highest ATPase activity were pooled and dialyzed overnight against Tris buffer. The dialyzed fractions were applied to a 7.5-ml Q Sepharose Fast Flow column (diameter 9 mm2) at 0.5 ml/min. After washing the column with 0.01% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, the activity was eluted by a gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in 0.3% Triton X-100 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2. Fractions with peak ATPase levels were pooled and dialyzed. Reaction mixtures contained 2 mm substrate (as indicated), 2 mmCaCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA in 30 mmTris-HCl (or 100 mm where indicated) at pH 7.4. In a number of experiments, the combination of CaCl2 with EDTA was replaced by the same concentration of MgCl2 and EGTA in order to test for enzymes specifically activated by magnesium (40.Nagy A.K. Walton N.Y. Treiman D.M. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1997; 31: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For the determination of optimum pH of activity, the buffer used was 50 mm Pipes for pH 6–7, 100 mm Tris for pH 6.5–9.5, and 50 mm borate for pH 8.5–11. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C the reaction was stopped by the addition of 150 μl of 0.25% (w/v) CuSO4, 1% (w/v) SDS, and 4.6% (w/v) sodium acetate, pH 4.0. The inorganic phosphate, produced from exogenous nucleotides during the incubation, was determined according to the method of LeBel et al. (41.LeBel D. Poirier G.G. Beaudoin A.R. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) as described earlier.2 One unit of enzyme activity corresponded to the release of 1 μmol of Pi/min at 37 °C. The ATPDase capture assay described by Strobel et al. (36.Strobel R.S. Nagy A.K. Knowles A.F. Buegel J. Rosenberg M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16323-163231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and slightly modified by Lemmens et al.2 was used for general characterization experiments. With the capture assay, the enzymatic activity was linear for at least 30 min with anR 2 of 0.98 (linear regression). Activity of the purified enzyme was tested in 1.5 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm content of nucleotide, 50 mm Tris, and 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. After the addition of the purified protein sample to the buffer, it was preincubated at 37 °C for exactly 2.5 min and reactions were started by the addition of the substrate (ATP or ADP), then terminated at 5 min with 0.25 ml of the Malachite Green reagent (42.Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The technique of LeBel et al. (41.LeBel D. Poirier G.G. Beaudoin A.R. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) described above, allowed the detection of phosphate derived from high concentrations of nucleotides, and was not affected by the enzyme inhibitors used in some of our assays. The technique of quantification of phosphate described by Baykov et al. (42.Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), on the other hand, was more sensitive and allowed measurements of nanomoles of Pi/ml. This latter technique was used for the evaluation of the kinetic parameters of the purified hATPDase. To determine specific activities, the protein content of the enzyme preparations was measured using the BCA protein assay (43.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). FSBA was incubated with hATPDase in conditions closed to what was described previously (44.Côté Y.P. Ouellet S. Beaudoin A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1160: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). FSBA was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and added to a final concentration of 0.125–2 mm FSBA and 5% Me2SO in 40 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm NaAc, 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 700 ng of purified hATPDase in 50 μl/assay. After a 25-min incubation at room temperature, 1 ml of reaction buffer was added and samples were immediately tested for enzyme activity as described above. Aliquots of the pooled fractions, obtained after immunoaffinity chromatography, containing 20 μg of protein, were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis under reducing conditions, proteins were transferred to a ProBlott polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Prior to NH2-terminal sequencing, the ProBlott membrane was subjected to three washing cycles with 50% HPLC grade methanol and HPLC grade water and then the band of interest was excised. NH2-terminal sequencing was carried out on a Procise 492 sequenator (Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems), operating in a pulsed-liquid mode. Monoclonal antibodies were developed against a partially purified fraction of porcine kidney nucleotidases.2Antibodies that bound ATPase activity from a pig kidney solubilized protein fraction were further tested by Western blotting against a particulate fraction of pig liver (Fig.1). Monoclonal antibodies to cd39 were used as control. The antibody 3A1 detected a protein of about 75 kDa on Western blots after non-reducing SDS-PAGE that is distinct from the 78-kDa cd39 protein (Fig. 1). This signal disappeared on Western blot when protein samples were treated with β-mercaptoethanol prior to SDS-PAGE (data not shown). After PNGase F treatment, most of the signal was also lost resulting in a diffuse doublet of bands of lower molecular mass at about 60 kDa (Fig. 1). Assuming aM r contribution of 2,000–4,000/oligosaccharide (45.Bartles J.R. Braiterman L.T. Hubbard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12792-12802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the decrease in the apparent molecular mass observed would indicate that the protein core detected by 3A1 (the hATPDase) had 4–8N-linked sugars. The observed decrease in signal did not seem to be due to protein degradation, since controls carried out in the same conditions or otherwise tested with anti-cd39 antibodies after deglycosylation revealed the appearance of bands at the expected size on Western blot (Fig. 1 and data not shown). The fact that 3A1 only recognized the fully glycosylated antigen with intact disulfide bridges suggests that this antibody detects a complex epitope. To determine the distribution of the protein bound by 3A1 monoclonal antibody, particulate fractions enriched in plasma membranes from a series of tissues were separated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and analyzed by immunoblotting. A very strong reaction was observed in liver at about 75 kDa with weaker reactions in kidney and duodenum (Fig.2). Other tissues appeared either negative or very weakly positive. The upper band seen in few tissues at about 160 kDa was most likely due to cross-reacting pig immunoglobulins, since it was detected with the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse antibody alone (data not shown). We then investigated the immunohistological localization of the hATPDase in liver and kidney (Fig. 3). The monoclonal antibody 3A1 specifically reacted with the bile canaliculi of the hepatocytes. Other tissue components were negative, including the basolateral membrane of the hepatocytes and intracellular compartments, the bile duct epithelium, the sinusoids, and the hepatic capsule. In the kidney cortex, staining was detected mainly at the luminal surface of tubules incorporating the brush border membrane. Bowman's capsule, glomeruli, and blood vessels were consistently negative. Comparisons of the localization of the hATPDase with the one of ATPDase/cd39 in liver and kidney revealed distinct differences. The 4D11 anti-cd39 antibody mainly reacted with the blood vessel walls of both organs, on endothelial and smooth muscle cells (Fig. 3). In liver, cd39 was found on the peribiliary vascular plexus while the epithelial cells of the bile ducts were negative. Endothelial cells of the centrolobular vein and the portal vein were stained but not as strongly as the endothelium of arteries. Sinusoids were weakly positive with staining more pronounced near the centrolobular vein. Hepatocytes were negative. In kidney, the 4D11 antibody reacted with peritubular capillaries and with the vascular and mesangial cells in the glomeruli. Since the ATPase detected by 3A1 appeared distinct from cd39, we further characterized the enzyme by capture assays. The effect of pH on the ATPase enzymatic activity was evaluated from pH 6.0 to 11.0. At pH 6.0 ATPase activity was about 50% of the maximum, while at or above pH 9.5 activity was barely detectable. Optimum pH ranges were from 6.8 to 8.0 (data not shown). Consequently, all further tests were carried out at physiological pH of 7.4. Both calcium- and magnesium-dependent nucleotidase activities were tested with multiple nucleotides (Fig.4). Although all triphospho- and diphosphonucleosides were hydrolyzed, a slight preference for pyrimidines over purines was observed in the presence of calcium. The hATPDase showed a marked preference for calcium over magnesium for all nucleotides tested. AMP, AP3A, AP4A, and AP5A were not hydrolyzed by the enzyme (Fig. 4 and data not shown). When 0.5 mm EDTA plus 0.5 mm EGTA was added to remove traces of divalent cations, no activity was detected with any of the substrates shown in Fig. 4 (data not shown). These results are largely comparable to those reported for ATPDase/cd39, albeit with minor differences in substrate and divalent cation preferences (see Ref. 3.Beaudoin A.R. Sévigny J. Picher M. Lee A.G. ATPases. 5. JAI Press Inc, Greenwich, CT1996: 369-401Google Scholar and references therein). Addition of ATP and ADP together did not increase the enzyme activity (data not shown; see below for the purified enzyme data). We next compared directly the effect of calcium and azide on ATPase and ADPase activity of ATPDase/cd39 and hATPDase using capture assays (Fig.5). Clear differences were observed between these two ATPDases. The enzyme bound by 3A1 needed much less calcium for optimal activity than cd39. This effect was more evident with ATP than w"

The expression of the XOR in humans is strikingly lower than in mice, and both transcription rates and core promoter activity of the gene are repressed. Analysis of humanXOR promoter activity in hepatocytes and vascular endothelial cells showed that the region from −258 to −1 contains both repressor and activator binding regions regulating core promoter activity. The region between −138 and −1 is necessary and sufficient for initiating, and the region between −258 and −228 is critical for restricting core promoter activity. Within the latter region, site-directed mutations identified a consensus sequence “acacaggtgtgg” (−242 to −230) that contains an E-box that binds a repressor. In addition, the TATA-like element is also required to restrict promoter activity and TFIID binds to this site. The results demonstrate that both an E-box and TATA-like element are required to restrict gene activity. A model is proposed to account for humanXOR regulation.

It is a homodimer with each subunit being about 150,000 Da, and containing four redox active centers: two iron-sulfur, one FAD, and one molybdopterin (1.Massey V. Brumby P.E. Komai H. J. Biol.

In mammals XOR exists in two interconvertible forms, xanthine dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidase. Xanthine dehydrogenase transfers the reducing equivalents generated by the oxidation of substrates to NAD+ whereas xanthine oxidase transfers them to oxygen with resultant production of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. As the rate-limiting enzyme in nucleic acid degradation, XOR catalyzes the final two reactions of purine catabolism with resultant production of urate.

Blood urate concentrations are approximately 10-fold higher in humans and most primates than in other mammals due to the evolutionary loss of uricase. These higher concentrations present a paradox.

Acta. 1992; 1117: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Post-translational mechanisms appear to only partially explain the low activity (26.Harrison R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27.Sanders S. Eisenthal R.S. Harrison R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the low activity in humans represents an adaptive mechanism to control the potentially deleterious formation of urate crystals and that repression of XOR expression is partially responsible. To begin to pursue this hypothesis, we cloned the human XOR (hXOR) cDNA and characterized the chromosomal location and genomic organization of the gene (28.Xu P. Huechsteadt T.P. Harrison R. Hoidal J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29.Xu P. Zhu X.L. Huecksteadt T.P. Brothman A. Hoidal J.R.

In the present study, we determined that expression of XOR in human tissues is strikingly restricted relative to that in mouse. Analysis ofXOR transcription rates and core promoter function of the 5′-untranslated region of the human and mouse genes indicates that transcription and core promoter activity of hXOR are repressed. An E-box with a consensus GTTTC and a TATA-like element present in the human, but not in the mouse 5′-untranslated region are required for the repression. A model is proposed to account for humanXOR regulation.DISCUSSIONXOR is a key enzyme in the catabolism of purines. Over the past century the enzymology of XOR has been intensively investigated. Despite a welter of information about its mechanisms of action, very little is known about factors that control its expression. Of note, relative to most other species, low XOR activity has been shown in a variety of human tissues. Post-translational mechanisms only partially explain the low activity (26.Harrison R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27.Sanders S. Eisenthal R.S. Harrison R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that repression of XOR expression is another mechanism contributing to the low activity in humans.The Expression of hXORGene Is Transcriptionally RepressedIn support of the hypothesis, in the present investigation we demonstrated that XOR transcript levels and transcription rates were substantially lower in human than mouse tissues. Moreover, the lower activity of the human promoter compared with that of the mouse in hepatocytes and vascular endothelial cells support the contention that a generalized repression ofh XOR gene expression may contribute to the low activity in humans.An E-box Regulates the Promoter Activity of the hXORGeneStudies to characterize the basis for repression ofh XOR transcription demonstrated that the core region from −138 to −1 is required for basal promoter activity and the sequence from −258 to −228 is required for repressive regulation of the basal activity. The requirement for both the core region and repressive sequence is not specific for a given cell type.We determined that the sequence acacaggtgtgg (−242 to −230) is critical for restricting promoter activity of the hXOR gene. This “core” sequence contains a consensus E box element (ACAGGTGT) located at −240. Site-directed mutations of the E-box element eliminated the repressive activity. This observation is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that the E-box may play a critical role as a regulatory site (43.Atchley W.R. Fitch W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Several transcription factors containing helix-loop-helix motifs have been identified that bind to the E-box, and augment or repress gene transcription. These include AREB6, USF, and TFII-I. AREB6, a zinc finger homeodomain protein, inhibits transcription by interacting with the repressor NC2. AREB6 is expressed in HepG2 and HUVECs (data not shown). In neuroblastoma cells, the repressive effect of AREB6 on the human 70-kDa heat shock gene promoter requires the sequence GTTTC in conjunction with the ACAGGTGT (38.Ikeda K. Kawakami K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). AREB6 is the only known factor whose regulation of promoter activity requires the presence of this conjuncted sequence (38.Ikeda K. Kawakami K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 39.Ikeda K. Halle J.P. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. Kawakami K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This sequence is present 21 bp upstream (−260) of the E-box inh XOR gene and preliminary studies have demonstrated binding of nuclear proteins to the E-box site and a requirement for the GTTTC for the binding (data not shown). Further studies will be necessary to determine whether AREB6 is indeed involved in repressing promoter activity of h XOR.The TATA-like Element Also Regulates the Repressed Promoter Activity of the hXORGeneRecently, a novel transcriptional activity was reported (42.Manley J.L. Um M. Li C. Ashali H. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that represses transcription from promoters containing the TATA-like element, but activates that lacking the TATA-like element. Compared with the TATA-less rat or mouseXOR, the region between −138 and −1 ofh XOR contains a TATA-like element (30.Xu P. Huecksteadt T.P. Hoidal J.R. Genomics. 1994; 34: 173-180Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 44.Cazzaniga G. Terao M. Schiavo P.L. Galbiati F. Segalla F. Seldin M.F. Garattini E. Genomics. 1992; 23: 390-402Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 45.Chow C-W. Clark M. Rinaldo J. Chalkley R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 46.Chow C-W. Clark M. Rinaldo J. Chalkley R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3132-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that conversion of the TATA to a non-TATA site relieved repression. These results indicate a functional requirement of the TATA-like element in repressive regulation ofh XOR.It was proposed that the mechanism of this repressor activity of the TATA-like element involved the interaction between TFIID and repressors (42.Manley J.L. Um M. Li C. Ashali H. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The requirement of a TATA-like element in repressive regulation of h XOR promoter may involve a similar mechanism of interaction of TFIID and repressors. Analysis of DNA-nuclear protein interactions showed three specific band shifts within the region from −138 to −51, indicating multiple transcription factors binding or interacting within the region. Further studies with a subset of specific competitors demonstrated that the shifts required a common or core region (from −125 to −89) that contained a centered TATA-like element. To examine TFIID binding to the region, we studied interactions between TFIID and the core region from −138 to −51. The results demonstrated that antibodies to TFIID blocked a specific band shift and TFIID protected the TATA-like element from the DNase I digestion by binding to the region. In addition, competition studies demonstrated that the sequences flanking the TATA-like element ofh XOR are required for the binding of nuclear proteins to the TATA-centered region. Taken together, the results suggest that there is a DNA-nuclear protein complex formed via interactions between several transcription factors and regulatory sites within the core region (−125 to −89) that produce a repressive activity of the TATA-like element. In the complex, TFIID may play a central role via binding to the element.Models for composite core promoters containing both TATA elements and initiators, such as the adenovirus major late promoter and human β-globin promoter (47.Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P. Novina C. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 48.Du H. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G.

Nature. 1993; 365: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), have been shown to provide alternative preinitiation complex assembly pathways. In the model, the stabilization of TFIID binding to the TATA element either by TFII-I binding to the initiator or by interacting with TFII-A provides differential mechanisms in gene regulation by specific activators or repressors (51.Roy A.L. Carruthers C. Gutjahr T. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1993; 365: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 52.Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1997; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In the TATA-less rat XOR, a series of four initiators have been reported that induce promoter activity by interacting with the initiator-binding proteins TFII-I or YY-1 (45.Chow C-W. Clark M. Rinaldo J. Chalkley R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 46.Chow C-W. Clark M. Rinaldo J. Chalkley R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2813-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the TATA-containing hXOR promoter, the fourth initiator of the rat XOR promoter is conserved and overlaps partially with the TATA element. Therefore, hXOR is an example of a composite core promoter. TFIID binding to the TATA-like element of the hXOR may be stabilized by TFII-I or YY-1 binding to the initiator, thereby providing the opportunity for differential regulation of hXOR. It has been reported that TFII-I is able to bind to initiators and the consensus E-box and YY-1 have repressive effects on gene transcription (47.Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P. Novina C. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 52.Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1997; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In future studies of mechanisms of repressive regulation of the hXORpromoter, it will be important to determine the role of the initiator and its binding proteins TFII-I and YY-1, including their possible interactions with the E-box.To summarize potential mechanisms for the repressed expression ofhXOR, a model is proposed and illustrated in Fig.11. In the model, the region from −138 to −1 provides a core for formation of a complex containing TFIID that is required for basal promoter activity. In a speculated bent DNA structure, the repressive transcription factors that bind to the E-box, possibly AREB6, may inhibit the gene transcription via indirect (through a protein-protein interaction with repressor NC2) or direct interactions with the TFIID-containing complex. NC2 has been shown to negatively regulate gene transcription by interacting with TFIID or by binding to AREB6 (38.Ikeda K. Kawakami K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 39.Ikeda K. Halle J.P. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. Kawakami K. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1992; 70: 477-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Based on the results of EMSA, other potential bindings are labeled as “A-E”, as illustrated in Fig. 11. The transcription factors “C” and “D” within the core region, possibly representing TFII-I, YY-1, or TFII-A, may alter the formation or stability of TFIID complex, thereby playing repressive roles in regulation of the gene transcription. The model suggests that alternative pathways may provide differential mechanisms of regulation of hXOR transcription in various pathological or physiological conditions. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR1; EC 1.1.3.22) is a molybdoflavoprotein hydroxylase that is widely distributed in nature. It is a homodimer with each subunit being about 150,000 Da, and containing four redox active centers: two iron-sulfur, one FAD, and one molybdopterin (1.Massey V. Brumby P.E. Komai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1682-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 3.Amaya Y.

In mammals XOR exists in two interconvertible forms, xanthine dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidase. Xanthine dehydrogenase transfers the reducing equivalents generated by the oxidation of substrates to NAD+ whereas xanthine oxidase transfers them to oxygen with resultant production of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. As the rate-limiting enzyme in nucleic acid degradation, XOR catalyzes the final two reactions of purine catabolism with resultant production of urate.

In the present study, we determined that expression of XOR in human tissues is strikingly restricted relative to that in mouse. Analysis ofXOR transcription rates and core promoter function of the 5′-untranslated region of the human and mouse genes indicates that transcription and core promoter activity of hXOR are repressed. An E-box with a consensus GTTTC and a TATA-like element present in the human, but not in the mouse 5′-untranslated region are required for the repression. A model is proposed to account for humanXOR regulation. DISCUSSIONXOR is a key enzyme in the catabolism of purines. Over the past century the enzymology of XOR has been intensively investigated. Despite a welter of information about its mechanisms of action, very little is known about factors that control its expression. Of note, relative to most other species, low XOR activity has been shown in a variety of human tissues. Post-translational mechanisms only partially explain the low activity (26.Harrison R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27.Sanders S. Eisenthal R.S. Harrison R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that repression of XOR expression is another mechanism contributing to the low activity in humans.The Expression of hXORGene Is Transcriptionally RepressedIn support of the hypothesis, in the present investigation we demonstrated that XOR transcript levels and transcription rates were substantially lower in human than mouse tissues. Moreover, the lower activity of the human promoter compared with that of the mouse in hepatocytes and vascular endothelial cells support the contention that a generalized repression ofh XOR gene expression may contribute to the low activity in humans.An E-box Regulates the Promoter Activity of the hXORGeneStudies to characterize the basis for repression ofh XOR transcription demonstrated that the core region from −138 to −1"

In this study, we localized binding sites for platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and nerve growth factor-β (NGF-β) to a linear sequence in the 180-kDa human α2M subunit which includes amino acids 591–774. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 591–774 (FP3) bound PDGF-BB and NGF-β in ligand blotting assays whereas five other fusion proteins, which collectively include amino acids 99–590 and 775–1451 did not. The K Dvalues for PDGF-BB and NGF-β binding to immobilized FP3 were 300 ± 40 and 180 ± 30 nm, respectively; these values were comparable with those determined using methylamine-modified α2M, suggesting that higher-order α2M structure is not necessary for PDGF-BB and NGF-β binding. PDGF-BB and NGF-β blocked the binding of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) to FP3. Furthermore, murinoglobulin, which is the only known member of the α-macroglobulin family that does not bind TGF-β, also failed to bind PDGF-BB and NGF-β. These results support the hypothesis that either a single linear sequence in human α2M or overlapping sequences are responsible for the binding of TGF-β, PDGF-BB, and NGF-β, even though there is minimal sequence identity between these three growth factors. FP3 blocked the binding of PDGF-BB to a purified chimeric protein, in which the extracellular domain of the PDGF β receptor was fused to the IgG1 Fc domain, and to PDGF receptors on NIH 3T3 cells. Thus, FP3 may inhibit the activity of PDGF-BB. α2-Macroglobulin (α2M) functions as a proteinase inhibitor and as a carrier of diverse growth factors.

J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although homologues of human α2M have been identified in numerous species, including primitive invertebrates (1.Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Starkey P.M. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1982; 205: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 3.Quigley J.P. Armstrong P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7903-7906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the function of this protein remains incompletely defined. α2M is found at high concentration in the plasma and has the capacity to inhibit diverse proteinases that differ in specificity and mechanism of action (4.Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of physiologic concentrations of other naturally occurring plasma proteinase inhibitors, the role of α2M in the regulation of most plasma proteinases is secondary. An interesting exception arises when foreign proteinases, such as snake venoms, are introduced into the circulation since α2M may be essential for neutralizing these proteinases (5.Baramova E.N. Shannon J.D. Bjarnason J.B. Gonias S.L. Fox J.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which α2M inhibits proteinases is unique and depends on the organization of its four identical 180-kDa subunits into a hollow cylinder-like structure (1.Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Unlike other proteinase inhibitors, α2M presents multiple target peptide bonds to attacking proteinases, thus accounting for its broad inhibitory specificity (6.Sottrup-Jensen L. Sand O. Kristensen L. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15781-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The target peptide bonds are located within a small region in the center of the α2M subunit called the “bait domain” (4.Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 6.Sottrup-Jensen L. Sand O. Kristensen L. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15781-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteinase-induced bait domain cleavage causes conformational change in α2M and a change in the size and shape of the central cavity (7.Andersen G.R. Kotch T.J. Dolmer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Nyborg J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8987-8993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As a result, reacting proteinases are irreversibly trapped within the α2M cylinder (1.Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). In native α2M, each subunit has a single β-cysteinyl-γ-glutamyl thiol ester bond that is formed by the side chains of Cys949 and Gln952 (10.Sottrup-Jensen L. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. FEBS Lett. 1980; 121: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 11.Swensen R.P. Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8087-8091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bait domain cleavage exposes the thiol esters, rendering these bonds reactive with various nucleophiles, including lysine side chains in the attacking proteinase (12.Salvesen G.S. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Nucleophiles that react with the thiol esters become covalently linked to Gln952. In the absence of proteinases, α2M thiol esters still react with small primary amines, such as methylamine, triggering a conformational change which is equivalent to that caused by trypsin or chymotrypsin (13.Björk I. Fish W.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14.Gonias S.L. Reynolds J.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 705: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition to proteinases, α2M binds a variety of functionally dissimilar proteins, including cytokines and growth factors, β-amyloid peptide, apolipoprotein E, myelin basic protein, and leptin (15.LaMarre J. Wollenberg G.K. Gonias S.L. Hayes M.A. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that some of these interactions depend on intact α2M quaternary structure, we recently identified a linear sequence in α2M that serves as a binding site for transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and TGF-β2 (21.Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13339-13346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The TGF-β-binding site was located in the center of the α2M subunit (aa 591–774) and overlapped with the bait domain. Binding of TGF-β to α2M may be particularly important since α2M regulates the activity of TGF-β that is produced endogenously by cells in culture (22.Lysiak J.J. Hussaini I.M. Webb D.J.

Neurol. 1999; 155: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the α2M gene knock-out mouse demonstrates abnormal responses to various forms of exogenous challenge that may be attributed to deficient TGF-β regulation (25.Umans L. Serneels L. Overbergh L. Lorent K. Van Leuven F. Van den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19778-19785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26.Webb D.J. Wen J. Lysiak J.J. Umans L. Van Leuven F. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24982-24988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Like TGF-β, nerve growth factor-β (NGF-β) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) bind noncovalently and reversibly to α2M (16.Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11270-11277Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In all three growth factors, a conserved set of disulfide bonds yields a unique three-dimensional structure called the cystine knot (28.McDonald N.Q. Hendrickson W.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 421-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar); however, TGF-β, PDGF-BB, and NGF-β demonstrate almost no sequence identity. At least one protein that binds to α2M, β-amyloid peptide, recognizes a sequence outside of FP3, near the COOH terminus of the α2M subunit (17.Hughes S. Khorkova O. Shefali G. Knaeblein J. Heroux J. Riedel N.G. Sahasrabudhe S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3275-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Thus, multiple regions of α2M may be responsible for different binding interactions. The goal of the present investigation was to identify the binding sites for NGF-β and PDGF-BB in the structure of human α2M. Our results indicate that these sites are located within FP3 and are identical or overlapping with the binding site for TGF-β. Other cytokines that have been reported to associate with α2M, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (29.Wollenberg G.K. LaMarre J. Rosendal S. Gonias S.L. Hayes M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (30.Soker S. Svahn C.M. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7685-7691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not bind to FP3, suggesting that the growth factor binding activity of FP3 is selective. Furthermore, murinoglobulin (MUG), which is the only α-macroglobulin identified to date that does not bind TGF-β (26.Webb D.J. Wen J. Lysiak J.J. Umans L. Van Leuven F. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24982-24988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), also failed to bind NGF-β and PDGF-BB. Thus, FP3 may serve as a novel region for growth factor interaction within the structure of human α2M. TGF-β1, NGF-β, PDGF-BB, TNF-α, and VEGF165 were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Methylamine HCl, dithiothreitol, iodoacetamide, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were from Sigma. pGEX-2T and prepacked glutathione-Sepharose-4B columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Immulon 2 microtiter plates were from Dynatech Laboratories (Chantilly, VA). 125I-Labeled PDGF-BB was from NEN Life Science Products Inc. TGF-β1 was radioiodinated with chloramine T to a specific activity of 100–200 μCi/μg as described previously (31.Ruff E. Rizzino A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). NGF-β and TNF-α were radiolabeled with IODO-GEN to a specific activity of 1–5 μCi/μg according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Pierce). VEGF was radiolabeled with chloramine T to a specific activity of 0.2–1.0 μCi/μg. α2M was purified from human plasma by the method of Imber and Pizzo (32.Imber M.J. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8134-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mature α2M subunit, in which the signal peptide has been removed, contains 1451 amino acids (33.Sottrup-Jensen L. Stepanik T.M. Kristensen T. Wierzbicki D.M. Jones C.M. Lønblad P.B. Magnusson S. Petersen T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8318-8327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MUG was purified from CD-1 female mice as described previously (26.Webb D.J. Wen J. Lysiak J.J. Umans L. Van Leuven F. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24982-24988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of purified MUG revealed a single band with an apparentM r of 180,000. α2M-MA was prepared by dialyzing α2M against 200 mm methylamine HCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, for 12 h at 22 °C followed by extensive dialysis against 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS), at 4 °C. Reaction of α2M with methylamine was confirmed by demonstrating the characteristic shift in mobility by nondenaturing PAGE (34.Van Leuven F. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9016-9022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An 18-kDa proteolytic fragment of the α2M subunit, which includes the carboxyl terminus (aa 1314–1451), was prepared by digesting α2M-MA with papain at pH 4.5 (35.Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. Van Leuven F. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (36.Hussaini I.M. Figler N.L. Gonias S.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The 18-kDa fragment contains the binding site for the α2M receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (35.Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. Van Leuven F. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins that contain fragments of the α2M sequence, including FP1 (aa 99–392), FP2 (aa 341–590), FP3 (aa 591–774), FP4 (aa 775–1059), and FP5 (aa 1030–1279), were prepared and purified as previously described (21.Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13339-13346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of FP1-FP5 have been renumbered, compared with our previous report (21.Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13339-13346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), to conform to the sequence of the mature α2M subunit, whereas the previous numbering corresponded to the sequence of the full-length subunit with a 23-amino acid signal peptide. The construct that encodes FP6 (aa1242–1451) was prepared by polymerase chain reaction, using the intact α2M cDNA in pBluescript as a template. The oligonucleotides encoded restriction sites for BamHI (5′) and EcoRI (3′), allowing direct cloning of the polymerase chain reaction product into PGEX-2T. The final construct was subjected to sequence analysis to verify its orientation and integrity and then transformed into BL21 cells. FP6 was expressed and purified as described previously (21.Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13339-13346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Ligand blotting has been previously used to demonstrate specific and saturable binding of TGF-β2 to FP3 (21.Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13339-13346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In preparation for ligand blotting experiments, native α2M, α2M-MA, MUG, the 18-kDa fragment, and the fusion proteins (FP1–FP6) were treated with 1 mm dithiothreitol in 2% SDS for 30 min at 37 °C. Free sulfhydryls were then blocked by reaction with 5 mm iodoacetamide for 2 h at 22 °C. Equivalent amounts of each intact α-macroglobulin (1 μg) or fusion protein (0.5 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electrotransferred to PVDF membranes that were subsequently blocked with 5% milk in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Membranes were probed with 125I-TGF-β1, 125I-NGF-β,125I-PDGF-BB, 125I-TNF-α, or125I-VEGF for 1 h at 22 °C, washed with PBS-T, and analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Diagnostics). Purified FP3 (2 μg in 100 μl), FP6 (2 μg in 100 μl), and α2M-MA (10 μg in 100 μl) were immobilized in 96-well microtiter plates by incubation for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were then washed three times with PBS-T and blocked with PBS-T for 2 h at 37 °C. Control wells were blocked with PBS-T without prior protein immobilization. 125I-TGF-β1 (0.2 nm) was incubated in wells with immobilized FP3, FP6, or α2M-MA, in the presence of 200 nm unlabeled TGF-β1 or increasing concentrations of NGF-β or PDGF-BB for 1 h at 22 °C. The wells were then washed three times with PBS-T. 125I-TGF-β1 that was associated with the immobilized phase was recovered in 0.1 m NaOH, 2% SDS and quantitated in a γ-counter. Specific binding of125I-TGF-β1 was determined as the fraction of binding that was inhibited by unlabeled TGF-β and plotted against the log of the concentration of PDGF-BB or NGF-β. Each reported value represents the mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments with internal duplicate replicates. Assuming that PDGF-BB and NGF-β completely block 125I-TGF-β1 binding to the immobilized protein, then the IC50 is related to theK D for the binding of PDGF-BB or NGF-β to FP3 or α2M-MA by the equation: KD=IC50/(1+[TGF­β]/K*D)Equation 1 K*D is the equilibrium dissociation constant for 125I-TGF-β1-binding to FP3 or α2M-MA, which is about 30 or 80 nm, respectively (21.Webb D.J.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A chimeric protein in which the extracellular domain of the PDGF β receptor is fused to the human IgG1 Fc domain was obtained from R&D Systems. The chimera (Rβ/Fc) (1 μg/ml) was immobilized in Immulon-2 plates by incubation for 12 h at 22 °C. The wells were then washed three times with PBS-T and blocked with 10 mg/ml BSA for 2 h at 37 °C. As a control, some wells were blocked with BSA without first immobilizing the Rβ/Fc. 125I-PDGF-BB (0.1 nm) was incubated with immobilized Rβ/Fc in the presence of FP3, FP6, or α2M-MA (each at 1.0 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C. In some experiments, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled PDGF-BB was added to determine specific binding. The wells were then washed three times with PBS-T.125I-PDGF-BB that was associated with the immobilized phase was recovered in 0.1 m NaOH, 2% SDS and quantitated in a γ-counter. NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The cells were passaged when subconfluent using enzyme-free dissociation buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and maintained in culture for at least 48 h. The cells were then washed with ice-cold Earle's balanced salts solution supplemented with 25 mm HEPES and 5 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4, and incubated with 125I-PDGF-BB (0.1 nm) in the presence of FP3, FP6, α2M-MA (1.0 μm), or vehicle for 4 h at 4 °C. Specific binding was determined by including a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled PDGF-BB. After washing the cultures, cell associated radioactivity was recovered in 1 m NaOH and quantitated in a γ-counter. Total cellular protein was determined with fluoroaldehyde reagent (Pierce). We previously demonstrated that TGF-β2 binds to FP3 and not to FP1, FP2, FP4, or FP5 (21.Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G. Gonias S.L. J. Biol.

Invest. 1991; 87: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) had previously demonstrated that TGF-β1 does not bind to the 18-kDa peptide, a proteolytic fragment of α2M which includes the COOH terminus. More recently, Hughes et al. (17.Hughes S. Khorkova O. Shefali G. Knaeblein J. Heroux J. Riedel N.G. Sahasrabudhe S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3275-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the α2M COOH terminus contains a significant binding site for another non-proteinase, β-amyloid peptide. Thus, we generated a sixth construct (FP6) which encodes the α2M COOH terminus (aa 1242–1451). As shown in Fig.1, 125I-TGF-β1 bound to FP3, but not to any of the other fusion proteins, including FP6. In separate studies, TGF-β1 also failed to bind to PVDF-immobilized 18-kDa fragment and purified GST (results not shown). PDGF-BB binds noncovalently to intact α2M whereas PDGF-AA does not (16.Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Bonner J.C. Osorinio-Vargas A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16236-16242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To determine whether a linear sequence in the structure of α2M is responsible for PDGF-BB-binding,125I-PDGF-BB (15 pm) was incubated with the six PVDF-immobilized fusion proteins. As shown in Fig.2, 125I-PDGF-BB bound to FP3, but not to the other five fusion proteins or purified GST. Identical results were obtained when these experiments were repeated using125I-PDGF-BB at different concentrations (30 and 60 pm). The 18-kDa fragment also failed to bind PDGF-BB, confirming the results obtained with FP6 (results not shown). The neurotrophins, NGF-β, NT-3, NT-4, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, cross-compete for binding to intact α2M, suggesting interaction with the identical or overlapping binding sites (27.Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11270-11277Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, 125I-NGF-β (20 pm) bound to FP3, but not to the other fusion proteins or purified GST. Equivalent results were obtained in experiments with 40 pm125I-NGF-β. Thus the binding sites for three structurally and functionally diverse growth factors (TGF-β, NGF-β, and PDGF-BB) are contained within a small region of the α2M subunit (amino acids 591–774). 125I-VEGF and125I-TNF-α did not demonstrate specific binding to any of the α2M fusion proteins, including FP3. Thus, the growth factor/cytokine binding activity of FP3 is selective within the context of proteins which have been previously reported to interact with intact α2M. 125I-TGF-β1 (0.2 nm) was incubated with FP3 and α2M-MA that were immobilized in microtiter plates. In the absence of competing agents, 6.9 ± 0.5 and 3.6 ± 0.4 fmol of 125I-TGF-β1 bound to FP3 and α2M-MA, respectively. 125I-TGF-β1 binding to FP3 and α2M-MA was decreased by greater than 85% when 200 nm unlabeled TGF-β1 was added, indicating that the observed binding was specific. Furthermore, less than 0.1 fmol of 125I-TGF-β1 bound to immobilized FP6 and to PBS-T-blocked control wells. PDGF-BB inhibited the binding of 125I-TGF-β1 to immobilized α2M-MA and FP3 (Fig.3). The highest concentration of PDGF-BB (0.8 μm) decreased TGF-β1 binding to FP3 by greater than 95%, suggesting that PDGF-BB and TGF-β binding to FP3 are mutually exclusive. The IC50 for inhibition of TGF-β1 binding to FP3 was 300 ± 40 nm, which represents an accurate estimate of the K D for PDGF-BB binding to FP3, since the concentration of 125I-TGF-β1 was low (21.Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13339-13346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The IC50 for inhibition of 125I-TGF-β1 binding to immobilized α2M-MA was 270 ± 20 nm. This value compares favorably with the previously reported K D (370 nm) for PDGF-BB binding to α2M-MA in solution (16.Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that α2M-MA immobilization does not adversely affect the PDGF-BB/α2M interaction. NGF-β inhibited the specific binding of 125I-TGF-β1 to immobilized FP3 and α2M-MA by up to 85% (Fig.4), suggesting that NGF-β binds to a sequence in FP3 that is either identical to or overlapping with the TGF-β1-binding site. The IC50 values for inhibition of TGF-β1 binding to immobilized FP3 and α2M-MA were 180 ± 30 and 150 ± 30 nm, respectively. The IC50 determined with immobilized α2M-MA compares favorably with the previously reported K D(110 nm) for NGF-β binding to α2M-MA in solution (16.Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results and our previously reported studies (27.Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11270-11277Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) demonstrating competition between various neurotrophins for binding to intact α2M suggest that the neurotrophins bind to a linear sequence in the structure of α2M that is identical or overlapping with the TGF-β-binding site. MUG is a monomeric α-macroglobulin from mouse and the only α-macroglobulin described thus far that fails to bind TGF-β (26.Webb D.J. Wen J. Lysiak J.J. Umans L. Van Leuven F. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24982-24988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Having co-localized the binding sites for TGF-β, PDGF-BB, and NGF-β in FP3, we undertook studies to determine whether PDGF-BB and NGF-β bind to MUG. Since ligand blotting was utilized, growth factor binding to isolated α-macroglobulin subunits was assessed. TGF-β2 binds equivalently to the subunits of native α2M and α2M-MA, probably reflecting the absence of higher-order structure following exposure to SDS (21.Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13339-13346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that125I-PDGF-BB also bound equivalently to native α2M and α2M-MA but did not bind to MUG. Identical results were obtained with 125I-NGF-β. Thus, TGF-β, PDGF-BB, and NGF-β recognize sequence(s) that are present in human α2M but not MUG. To determine whether the interaction of FP3 with PDGF-BB blocks binding of PDGF-BB to its signaling receptor, purified Rβ/Fc was immobilized in microtiter plates. Rβ/Fc contains the growth factor-binding domain of the PDGF β receptor. In the absence of inhibitors, 0.57 ± 0.04 fmol of 125I-PDGF-BB bound to Rβ/Fc and 87 ± 6% of the binding was specific. FP3 and α2M-MA inhibited specific binding by 84 and 85%, respectively, whereas FP6, at the same concentration, had no effect (Fig.6 A). In these experiments, inhibition of PDGF-BB binding to Rβ/Fc is based on the ability of FP3 or α2M-MA to bind 125I-PDGF-BB in solution and thereby decrease the concentration of free 125I-PDGF-BB that is available to interact with the immobilized receptor. The extent of inhibition is related to the concentration of competing agent, as described previously (21.Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13339-13346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To confirm the results of our experiments with purified Rβ/Fc, we studied the binding of 125I-PDGF-BB to NIH 3T3 cells in culture. When 0.1 nm125I-PDGF-BB was incubated with the cells at 4 °C, in the absence of competing agents, specific binding was 28 ± 6 fmol/mg of cell protein. FP3 and α2M-MA reduced specific binding by greater than 95%, whereas FP6, at the identical concentration, had no effect (Fig. 6 B). These results provide further evidence that FP3 and α2M-MA bind125I-PDGF-BB in solution, forming complexes that are no longer recognized by PDGF receptors. The α2M subunit includes well defined regions that are responsible for specific functions, including the bait domain (aa 666–706) (6.Sottrup-Jensen L. Sand O. Kristensen L. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15781-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the thiol ester loop region (aa 949–952) (10.Sottrup-Jensen L. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. FEBS Lett. 1980; 121: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 11.Swensen R.P. Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8087-8091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the α2M receptor/LRP recognition sequence (including aa 1370–1374) (40.Nielsen K.L. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Moestrup S.K.

A binding site for TGF-β has been identified in FP3 (aa 591–774) (21.Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13339-13346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and a distinct binding region has been identified for β-amyloid peptide (aa 1202–1451) (17.Hughes S. Khorkova O. Shefali G. Knaeblein J. Heroux J. Riedel N.G. Sahasrabudhe S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3275-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In this study, we have determined that FP3 contains linear sequences that are responsible for the binding of PDGF-BB and NGF-β. TheK D values for the binding of PDGF-BB and NGF-β to immobilized FP3 were similar to the constants determined with intact α2M-MA. Thus, higher-order structure in α2M, which is probably lost in FP3, is not necessary for interaction with PDGF-BB and NGF-β. The binding sites for PDGF-BB and NGF-β in FP3 are overlapping or identical with the TGF-β-binding site since the three growth factors cross-competed for FP3 binding. FP3 inhibited the binding of PDGF-BB to a chimeric protein containing the extracellular domain of the PDGF β receptor, suggesting that FP3 and the β receptor recognize identical or adjacent sequences in PDGF-BB. Furthermore, MUG, which lacks TGF-β binding activity (21.Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13339-13346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), also failed to bind PDGF-BB and NGF-β. These results support the hypothesis that there is a conserved sequence in human α2M and multiple other α-macroglobulins, but not MUG, that is required for the binding of TGF-β, PDGF-BB, and NGF-β. The list of α-macroglobulins reported to bind TGF-β includes human α2M, murine α2M, rat α2M, rat α1M, bovine α2M, and rabbit α2M (26.Webb D.J. Wen J. Lysiak J.J. Umans L. Van Leuven F. Gonias S.L. J.

J. 1995; 312: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In these α-macroglobulins, the bait domain, which is contained within FP3, is an area of extreme sequence diversity (6.Sottrup-Jensen L. Sand O. Kristensen L. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15781-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Overbergh L. Hilliker C. Lorent K. Van Leuven F. Van den Berghe H. Genomics. 1994; 22: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the binding sites for TGF-β, PDGF-BB, and NGF-β may be located adjacent to the bait domain in an area of increased sequence conservation. In the three-dimensional structure of intact tetrameric α2M, the bait domain is apparently part of a flexible loop located inside the hollow cylinder structure (45.Gettins P. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 25: 5011-5017Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 46.Andersen G.R. Koch T.J. Dolmer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Nyborg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25133-25141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that growth factors, that bind to intact α2M, are not recognized by growth factor-specific antibodies (47.O'Connor-McCourt M. Wakefield L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14090-14099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in α2M-proteinase complexes, the number of growth factor-binding sites is limited by the number of proteinases that are bound (one or two) (48.Hall S.W. LaMarre J. Marshall L.B. Hayes M.A. Gonias S.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), although the results presented here suggest that each subunit expresses an independent growth factor-binding site. These results suggest that the growth factor-binding site in FP3, like the bait domain, is located inside the α2M cylinder and that steric constraints limit the number of growth factors that may be bound by each intact α2M. The gene for α2M is located on chromosome 16 in a region that has been implicated in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (49.Pericak-Vance M.A. Bass M.L. Yamaoka L.H. Scott W.K. Terwedow H.A. Menold M.M.

Some but not all studies suggest that polymorphisms in the α2M gene may be associated with Alzheimer's disease (50.Blacker D. Wilcox M.A. Laird N.M. Rodes L. Horvath S.M. Go R.C.P. Perry R. Watson B.

Nature Genet. 1999; 22: 17-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Reactive microglial cells that border neuritic plaques produce α2M which could regulate disease progression (54.Van Gool D. De Strooper B. Van Leuven F. Triau E. Dom R. Neurobiol. Aging. 1993; 14: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); however, De Strooperet al. (55.De Strooper B. Van Leuven F. Van den Berghe H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 50-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) has shown that α2M does not affect processing of amyloid precursor protein and formation of β-amyloid peptide. Other mechanisms by which α2M may influence Alzheimer's disease progression include regulation of proteinases involved in processes other than amyloid precursor protein processing, binding of β-amyloid peptide, or binding of growth factors such as neurotrophins and TGF-β. One α2M gene polymorphism that has been associated with Alzheimer's disease is a 5′ splice site deletion preceding exon 18, which encodes part of the bait domain (50.Blacker D. Wilcox M.A. Laird N.M. Rodes L. Horvath S.M. Go R.C.P. Perry R. Watson B. Bassett S.S. McInnis M.G. Albert M.S. Hyman B.T. Tanzi R.E.

Exon 18 is a major contributor to FP3, which we have now identified as the neurotrophin-binding site. If the 5′ splice site deletion causes aberrant splicing, then neurotrophin binding to α2M may be affected in addition to proteinase inhibition. Despite previous studies demonstrating TNF-α binding to intact α2M (29.Wollenberg G.K. LaMarre J. Rosendal S. Gonias S.L. Hayes M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar, 57.Webb D.J. Gonias S.L. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 939-948PubMed Google Scholar), we were not able to localize a TNF-α-binding site within the six fusion proteins. These results suggest that the TNF-α/α2M interaction may be qualitatively different than the other interactions described here. For example, TNF-α binding may depend on intact quaternary α2M structure. Interestingly, Wu et al. (58.Wu S.M. Patel D.D. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4356-4365PubMed Google Scholar) reported that oxidation of intact α2M decreases binding of growth factors involved in tissue repair, including TGF-β1, TGF-β2, PDGF-BB, and NGF-β, while increasing the binding affinity of α2M for inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α. The tissue repair growth factors refered to by Wu et al. (58.Wu S.M. Patel D.D. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4356-4365PubMed Google Scholar) are in fact the family of growth factors that bind to FP3. Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that oxidative modification of a single amino acid in FP3 may be responsible for the decrease in binding affinity of intact α2M for TGF-β1, PDGF-BB, and NGF-β. The paradoxical increase in binding affinity for TNF-α, which is observed when α2M is oxidized, is consistent with this interaction being independent of the growth factor-binding site in FP3. The availability of a recombinant peptide with the capacity to bind and neutralize the activity of functionally diverse growth factors is novel. We have already demonstrated the ability of FP3 to promote endothelial cell growth in vitro in an assay configured to detect TGF-β activity (21.Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13339-13346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our studies with Rβ/Fc and NIH 3T3 cells suggest that FP3 may counteract the biological activities of PDGF-BB as well. The activities expressed by FP3 in different experimental systems will probably reflect the spectrum of growth factors that are functional in each system."
https://openalex.org/W2045132122,"5812 base pairs of rat GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) 5′-flanking region were cloned and sequenced, and the transcription start site was determined for the gene in rat liver. Progressive deletion analysis using transient transfection assays of luciferase reporter constructs defined the core promoter as a highly conserved 142-base pair GC-rich sequence upstream from the cap site. DNase I footprint analysis of this region revealed (5′ → 3′) a Sp1/GC box, a noncanonical cAMP-response element (CRE), a CCAAT-box, and an E-box. Transcription from the core promoter in PC12 but not C6 or Rat2 cells was enhanced by incubation with 8-bromo-cyclic AMP. Mutagenesis showed that both the CRE and CCAAT-box independently contribute to basal and cAMP-dependent activity. The combined CRE and CCAAT-box cassette was also found to enhance basal transcription and confer cAMP sensitivity on a heterologous minimal promoter. The addition of the Sp1/GC box sequence to this minimal promoter construct inhibited basal transcription without affecting the cAMP response. EMSA showed that nuclear proteins from PC12 but not C6 or Rat2 cells bind the CRE as a complex containing activating transcription factor (ATF)-4 and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β, while both PC12 and C6 cell nuclear extracts were recruited by the CCAAT-box as a complex containing nuclear factor Y. Overexpression of ATF-4 in PC12 cells was found to transactivate the GTPCH promoter response to cAMP. These studies suggest that the elements required for cell type-specific cAMP-dependent enhancement of gene transcription are located along the GTPCH core promoter and include the CRE and adjacent CCAAT-box and the proteins ATF-4, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β, and nuclear factor Y. 5812 base pairs of rat GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) 5′-flanking region were cloned and sequenced, and the transcription start site was determined for the gene in rat liver.

GTPCH is therefore absolutely necessary for the synthesis of the signaling molecules dopamine (DA), norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, melatonin, and nitric oxide as well as the detoxification of the amino acidl-phenylalanine.

The genes encoding for human and mouse GTPCH have recently been cloned (10.Ichinose H. Ohye T. Matsuda Y. Hori T. Blau N. Burlina A. Rouse B. Matalon R. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10062-10071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and their 5′-flanking regions have been shown to promote transcription of heterologous reporter genes (11.Witter K.

Kapatos G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, virtually nothing is known regarding either the cis-acting elements ortrans-acting factors that control the expression of GTPCH. In the rat brain, GTPCH is localized to monoamine-containing neurons (6.Hirayama K. Lentz S.I. Kapatos G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1006-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13.Nagatsu I.

Brain Res. 1997; 777: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The abundance of GTPCH mRNA (15.Lentz S.I. Kapatos G. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 28: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and protein (16.Hirayama K. Kapatos G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) within these cells is very heterogeneous, with particularly low levels found within nigrostriatal DA neurons. Unlike many other cell types that contain GTPCH, DA neurons respond to increased levels of cAMP with a robust increase in GTPCH mRNA and BH4 content that is dependent upon gene transcription (17.Zhu M. Hirayama K. Kapatos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11825-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular specificity of this response suggests that transcription factor(s) other than or in addition to the relatively ubiquitous CREB (18.Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) are involved in this process. BH4 synthesis within human nigrostriatal DA neurons is known to be selectively vulnerable to genetic mutations in GTPCH that cause hereditary progressive dystonia (19.Ichinose H. Ohye T. Takahashi E.-i. Seki N. Hori T. Segawa M. Nomura Y. Endo K. Tanaka H. Tsuji S. Fuita K. Nagatsu T. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Identification of the gene promoter elements and their cognate binding proteins that control basal and cAMP-dependent GTPCH transcription within DA neurons may thus be crucial to our understanding of this disorder as well as other diseases that involve this population of neurons. Toward this end, we have now cloned, sequenced, and begun to identify and characterize basal and cAMP response elements within 5812 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the rat GTPCH gene. These studies indicate that a noncanonical CRE and adjacent CCAAT-box that are located within the 142-bp core promoter region and recruit the transcription factors ATF-4, C/EBPβ, and NF-Y in vitro are both necessary and sufficient to confer sensitivity to cAMP on the GTPCH promoter. Approximately 106 plaques from a Harlan Sprague Dawley rat testis genomic library (Lambda DASH II; Strategene, La Jolla, CA) were screened by hybridization with a random primed 886-bp cDNA containing the entire rat GTPCH coding sequence (20.Hatakeyama K. Inoue Y. Harada T. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 765-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two positive plaques were purified by repeated plating and hybridization, and their DNA was then used as templates in PCR screening reactions. Primers for screening PCR (primer −112/−92, 5′-TCGGTGCAGAACTCCTGTCC-3′; primer 293/315, 5′-CTGAGATGGTCTCCTGTTATCCC-3′) were designed based upon the rat GTPCH cDNA sequence and the mouse GTPCH genomic structure to amplify 427 bp within rat exon 1, including a major portion of the 5′-UTR and theNcoI site at the GTPCH initiation codon. DNA from one of the positive plaques produced a PCR product of the correct size that when digested with NcoI yielded fragments of approximately 315 and 110 bp, as would be predicted based upon the rat GTPCH cDNA sequence. DNA from this plaque was isolated, the insert was freed from the vector by restriction digestion, and the entire digest was subjected to Southern blot analysis using as the probe an end-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to bases −47 to −23 of the rat GTPCH 5′-UTR (primer −47/−23; 5′-AGACACCCGAAGGTGCTACCAAGCG-3′). This analysis indicated that the insert was approximately 15 kb in size. Digestion of the 15-kb insert with NcoI yielded fragments of approximately 6 and 9 kb. Southern blot analysis of thisNcoI digest with the −47/−23 5′-UTR probe showed that the 6-kb fragment contained GTPCH 5′-flanking sequence. This 6 kb was subcloned into the NcoI site of pGEM5Z to produce p6GTPCH5Z. Both strands of p6GTPCH5Z were sequenced by primer walking using the dideoxy chain terminator technique. This analysis revealed that the 6-kb insert was actually 5812 bp in size and, as predicted, contained at its 3′-end the entire 127 bp of the rat GTPCH cDNA 5′-UTR sequence including the initiation codon. p6GTPCH5Z was digested withNcoI, and the 5.8-kb insert was isolated and cloned in both directions into the NcoI site of the luciferase-based reporter vector pGL3basic (pGL3luc; Promega, Madison, WI) to produce 5.8GTPCHluc and the inverted INV5.8GTPCHluc. Based upon the restriction map of the insert (Fig. 3 A), 5.8GTPCHluc was digested with either ApaI (0.271 kb), NheI (1.768 kb), orHindIII (3.621 kb) to generate the deletion constructs 0.27-, 1.8-, or 3.6GTPCHluc, respectively. The luciferase-based reporter plasmids TKluc, containing 148 bp of the human Herpesvirus thymidine kinase minimal promoter (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA) or pGL3 enhancer, containing 195 bp of the SV40 minimal early promoter (Promega, Madison, WI), were digested with MluI and BglII and ligated with high pressure liquid chromatography-purified double-stranded oligonucleotides containing either the GTPCH CRE and CCAAT-box alone (cre/ccaat; positions −112 to −63; see Fig. 1) or the Sp1/GC box, CRE, and CCAAT-box (sp1/cre/ccaat; positions −142 to −63) to produce the minimal promoter constructs GTPCHcre/ccaatTKluc and GTPCHsp1/cre/ccaatTKluc and the minimal promoter constructs GTPCH-cre/ccaatSV40luc and GTPCHsp1/cre/ccaatSV40luc, respectively. Plasmid DNA was purified either by centrifugation through CsCl or on QIAGEN columns (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, CA).Figure 1Nucleotide sequence and organization of the proximal 5′-flanking region of the rat, mouse, and human GTPCH genes.

Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). A 217-nucleotide end-labeled single-stranded cDNA probe was synthesized by asymmetric PCR using the primer pair −239/−218 (5′-GCGCCTTGACGCAAGAGGCTC-3′) and −47/−23. PCR parameters included 30 1-min cycles at 95, 62, and 72 °C. The primary PCR product was gel-purified and used as a template for the secondary PCR. The secondary PCR primer, −47/−23, was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) using T4 kinase. The conditions for asymmetric PCR were identical to the primary PCR except that only the 32P-labeled primer was present. The single-stranded radiolabeled PCR product was gel-purified and used for S1 nuclease protection analysis. Poly(A+) mRNA from rat liver (5 μg) and muscle (20 μg) in 20 μl of S1 hybridization buffer (80% deionized formamide, 40 mmPIPES, pH 6.4, 400 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) was hybridized overnight at 56 °C with 50,000 cpm of probe. S1 nuclease digestion was carried out for 90 min at 37 °C by adding 300 μl of S1 nuclease buffer (0.28 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 4.5 mm ZnSO4, 10 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 300 units of S1 nuclease). 100 μl of S1 stop buffer (4 m ammonium acetate, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 50 μg/ml tRNA) was added to terminate the reaction. After ethanol precipitation, samples were run on a 7.5% polyacrylamide, 8m urea denaturing gel. A dideoxynucleotide sequencing reaction using 1.7GTPCHluc as template and end-labeled −47/−23 as primer was run simultaneously on the same gel. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for 1 week at room temperature. Mutations of the CRE and CCAAT elements were introduced into 0.27GTPCHluc by overlap extension (21.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). The primers used for mutagenesis (mutations are underlined) were as follows: CREmt(+),′-GCGCCTTAATTCAAGAGGCTC-3′; CCAATmt(+), 5′-GCTCGGGACTATGAGAACGCCT-3′; Glprimer2(−), 5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCA-3′; Rvprimer3(−), 5′-CTAGCAAAATAGGCTGTCCC-3′. Two sets of primary PCR reactions were run using the CREmt(+) plus Glprimer2 and the CREmt(−) plus Rvprimer3 primer pairs. The secondary PCR reaction was carried out using the combined gel-purified primary PCR products as templates. PCRs were hot started at 95 °C for 5 min and then continued for 30 1-min cycles at 95, 60, and 72 °C, with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The final PCR product was digested with NcoI and MluI and cloned back into the pGL3 basic vector to produce 0.27GTPCHlucCREmt. The identical strategy was used for mutation of the CCAAT-box alone or in combination with the mutated CRE. 0.27GTPCHluc or 0.27GTPCHlucCREmt DNA were used as templates for these primary PCRs to produce 0.27GTPCHlucCCAATmt and 0.27GTPCHlucCREmtCCAATmt, respectively. All mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. Cultures of PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 7.5% fetal calf serum, and 7.5% horse serum. Cultures of C6 glioma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 5% fetal calf serum. Cultures of Rat2 fibroblast cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum. All cultures contained penicillin/streptomycin and were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. Cells were seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated 16-mm dishes 24 h prior to transfection and grown to approximately 80% confluency. Cells were typically transfected with 0.45 μg of experimental DNA and 0.01–0.05 μg of pRSVβgal or pCMVβgal DNA using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). For comparisons across constructs that differed in size, molar amounts of experimental DNA were equalized by the addition of pGEM5Z DNA. For co-transfection experiments, 0.3 μg of 0.27GTPCHluc DNA was transfected along with 0.05–0.15 μg of pCG-hATF4 (cytomegalovirus-driven human ATF-4, a gift from Dr. T. Hai, Ohio State University) or empty vector DNA along with 0.05–0.15 μg of pRSVβgal DNA. 18 h later, 5 mm 8-Br-cAMP dissolved in growth-conditioned media was added. Cultures were harvested 7–18 h later in lysis buffer and assayed for luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI) and β-galactosidase (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA) activities as described by the manufacturers. Parallel experiments using β-galactosidase enzyme histochemistry showed that transfection efficiency was similar for each cell type (15–25%; data not shown). Luciferase activity was divided by β-galactosidase activity to correct for transfection efficiency and was expressed as relative luciferase activity. Large scale PC12 nuclear extracts used for DNase I protection analysis were prepared by the method of Dignam (22.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Small scale nuclear extracts from PC12, C6, and Rat2 cells grown in 100-mm dishes were prepared for use in EMSA analysis by the method of Andrews and Faller (23.Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (24.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215507) Google Scholar). p0.27GTPCHluc was digested withNcoI or MluI, and the resulting overhangs were filled in with Klenow and [α-32P]CTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) followed by a chase reaction with unlabeled nucleotides. TheNcoI digest was then treated with MluI, and theMluI digest was treated with NcoI in order to label only the coding or noncoding strands, respectively. Probes were then purified by acrylamide gel electrophoresis, dialyzed, phenol-extracted, and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. To 20 μl of reaction buffer (12.5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 5 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin) on ice was added 20 μl of nuclear extract containing up to 150 μg of protein. The binding reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of reaction buffer containing approximately 20,000 cpm of 32P-labeled probe, and the incubation continued for 20 min at room temperature. Alternatively, studies using competing oligonucleotides included a 120-min incubation on ice prior to the addition of probe and then an additional 20 min at room temperature. Samples were then incubated at room temperature for 1 min with a quantity of RQ1 DNase I sufficient to digest approximately 50% of the labeled DNA probe both in the presence and absence of binding protein. The RQ1 reaction was terminated by the addition of stop buffer (400 mm sodium acetate, 0.2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 20 μg/ml proteinase K). Samples were then incubated at 55 °C, phenol-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. Labeled coding and noncoding strands were chemically sequenced (25.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (9012) Google Scholar) to yield combined purines (G + A) and pyrimidines (T + C), which were then run alongside the DNase I-treated samples on a 6% acrylamide, 8 m urea gel. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. Single-stranded complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and T4 kinase. To 13 μl of reaction buffer (12.5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 5 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin) on ice was added 5 μl of nuclear extract containing up to 5 μg of protein. The binding reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 μl of reaction buffer containing approximately 50,000 cpm of end-labeled oligonucleotide and continued for 20 min at room temperature. Antibodies (4 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or competing double-stranded oligonucleotides were added to the reaction buffer before protein and 120 or 30 min, respectively, prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotide. Samples were then returned to ice, and the entire volume was loaded onto a 5% acrylamide gel containing 1% glycerol and 1× TBE. Running buffer was 1× TBE containing 1% glycerol. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film overnight at −80 °C. A combined strategy of Southern analysis, exon-based PCR, and restriction digestion was used to identify and clone 5.812 kb of rat GTPCH 5′-flanking sequence up to and including the translation initiation codon. A three-way alignment of the rat sequence with GTPCH 5′-flanking sequence currently available for the mouse and human genes showed a high degree of homology surrounding the previously established transcription start sites (10.Ichinose H. Ohye T. Matsuda Y. Hori T. Blau N. Burlina A. Rouse B. Matalon R. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10062-10071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,11.Witter K. Werner T. Blusch J.H. Schneider E.-M. Riess O. Ziegler I. Rodl W. Bacher A. Gutlich M. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Because the human and mouse start sites are reportedly different, however, the start site for rat GTPCH was determined using S1 nuclease protection analysis (Fig.2 A). The target mRNAs for this study were isolated from the liver, which expresses GTPCH mRNA, and striated muscle, which does not (6.Hirayama K. Lentz S.I. Kapatos G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1006-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This analysis showed that only mRNA from liver was able to protect the 217-nucleotide single-stranded cDNA probe from S1 nuclease digestion (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, only a single band of approximately 100 nucleotides in size was protected, and this was aligned with an A at position −129 of the sequencing ladder. A transcription start site for rat liver GTPCH can thus be assigned to the T 129 bp upstream from the initiation codon and 2 bases upstream from the available cDNA sequence (20.Hatakeyama K. Inoue Y. Harada T. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 765-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that this position differs from both the reported mouse and human start sites (Fig. 1). All positions within the rat 5′-flanking sequence have been indexed relative to this +1 transcription start site. DNA containing the reporter construct 5.8GTPCHluc was transiently transfected into PC12 cells, which normally express GTPCH mRNA (6.Hirayama K. Lentz S.I. Kapatos G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1006-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), or C6 or Rat2 cells, which normally do not (9.D'Sa C. Hirayama K. West A. Hahn M. Zhu M. Kapatos G. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 41: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These studies showed that transcription from this chimeric gene was roughly equivalent in each cell line and up to 20-fold greater than produced by the promoterless pGL3luc or the inverted 5.8GTPCHluc construct (Fig.3 B). This suggests that DNA elements responsible for restricting expression of the endogenous GTPCH gene to PC12 cells are either not located within the 5.812 kb of 5′-flanking sequence or cannot be detected using transient transfection assays. Progressive deletions of the 5.8-kb construct revealed that the minimal promoter sequence necessary to sustain transcription in each cell line is located within 0.27GTPCHluc, which contains 142 bp upstream from the cap site and the entire 128 bp of GTPCH mRNA 5′-UTR (+142 to −128; Fig. 1). Deletion analysis also detected a stepwise increase in transcription as 5′-flanking sequence was eliminated. This suggests that control elements that normally repress transcription may be found upstream from the core promoter. PC12 cells transfected with 5.8GTPCHluc responded to 8-Br-cAMP treatment with a 4–7-fold increase in relative luciferase activity (Fig. 3 B). This contrasts with the 1.3–1.9-fold increase observed for the empty pGL3luc vector or the INV5.8GTPCHluc construct. Deletion of sequence up to the ApaI site (Fig.3 A) did not diminish the response to 8-Br-cAMP. Thecis-acting elements required for the cAMP-dependent activation of GTPCH transcription are thus located within the 142-bp core promoter contained within 0.27GTPCHluc and presented in Fig. 1. In contrast to PC12 cells, transcription in C6 and Rat2 cells was either unaltered or slightly decreased following treatment with 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 3 B). Thetrans-acting factors(s) required for the cAMP-dependent enhancement of GTPCH transcription are therefore found in PC12 cells, which normally express this gene, but not in two cell lines that do not. A computerized search of the 142-bp GTPCH core promoter for putative cis-acting elements that may be responsible for the stimulation of transcription by cAMP was undertaken using the TFMATRIX transcription factor binding site profile data base (26.Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 364-370Crossref Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). This search revealed an asymmetrical or partial CRE (TGACGCAA) located between positions −104 and −97 that differed from the CRE palindrome (TGACGTCA) at positions 6 and 7 of the octomer (Fig. 1). Computer analysis also revealed a number of other putative protein binding motifs including three overlapping Sp1/GC box sites between positions −110 and −137, a CCAAT-box between positions −82 and −86, a TATA-like sequence at positions −45 to −39, and an E-box located at positions −17 to −12. DNase I footprint analysis of the core promoter using nuclear extracts prepared from untreated PC12 cells detected three distinct protein binding domains (Fig.4). Domain 1 is a 26-bp region that spans from position +7 to −19 and includes the transcription start site and the E-box (Fig. 1). Domain 1 also contains two hypersensitive sites; a C at position −19 of the coding strand and a G at position −7 of the noncoding strand. Domain 2 is a 29-bp region that spans from position −97 to −69 and is centered upon the CCAAT-box. Domain 4 (numbered out of order; see below) is a 22-bp region that is 86% GC, spans from position −132 to −111 and is centered upon the repeating Sp1/GC box elements. Footprint analysis thus established a general agreement between putative and actual protein binding sites. Notably missing were protected sequences associated with the TATA-like ATAAAAA element and the partial CRE. Incubation of core promoter DNA with 1 μg of recombinant human CREB-1 bZip domain (amino acids 254–327; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) produced a weak footprint, referred to as domain 3, that spanned from position −106 to −97 (Fig.5). This footprint corresponds to the CRE predicted by computer analysis and overlaps the 5′ boundary of domain 2.Figure 5DNase I footprint and competition analysis detects recombinant CREB-1 binding to domain 3 of the core promoter region and also demonstrates that the failure of PC12 nuclear extracts to footprint domain 3 is not due to occupation of domains 2 and 4 by their cognate binding proteins. A, competing double-stranded oligonucleotides with consensus sitesunderlined and mutations in boldface type. B, the 32P-labeled noncoding strand of the 271-bp insert from 0.27GTPCHluc was used as the probe. 1 μg of recombinant human CREB-1 or 35 μg of nuclear extract prepared from unstimulated PC12 cells was used in these assays. Competing oligonucleotides were added 120 min prior to the probe. Incubation with CREB-1 protein resulted in a weak footprint over positions −97 to −106, which corresponds to the CRE and is referred to as domain 3. Elimination of binding to domains 2 and 4 by competing CCAAT and Sp1 oligonucleotides did not result in the appearance of domain 3. The locations of each domain and the cis-acting elemen"

Since N- and C-terminal truncations of CRF lead to loss of biological activity, it has been thought that almost the entire peptide is essential for receptor activation. Here we show the existence of two segregated receptor binding sites at the N and C termini of CRF, connection of which is essential for receptor binding and activation. Connection of the two binding sites by highly flexible ε-aminocaproic acid residues resulted in CRF analogues that remained full, although weak agonists (EC50: 100–300 nm) independent of linker length. Connection of the two sites by an appropriate helical peptide led to a very potent analogue, which adopted, in contrast to CRF itself, a stable, monomer conformation in aqueous solution. Analogues in which the two sites were connected by helical linkers of different lengths were potent agonists; their significantly different biopotencies (EC50: 0.6–50 nm), however, suggest the relative orientation between the two binding sites rather than the maintenance of a distinct distance between them to be essential for a high potency.

Rivier C. Perrin M. Koerber S.C. Sutton S. Corrigan A. Lahrichi S.L. Craig A.G. Vale W. Rivier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10575-10579Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), have been suggested as stabilizing a biologically active conformation. Therefore, amino acid variations within the N and C termini (non-conserved amino acid residues) within the CRF family may function interdependently in such interactions. In order to address the question, we synthesized chimeric peptides, combining the N and C termini of oCRF, urotensine, and sauvagine. The chimeric peptides exhibited a high biological potency (Table I), showing that these amino acid variations are, in fact, not interdependent with respect to stabilization of the biologically active conformation.Assuming an α-helical conformation of CRF to be advantageous for receptor interaction, substitution of those amino acid residues of CRF that are not individually essential for receptor interaction, especially the non-conserved residues within the CRF family, by others with a high helical propensity, such as alanine, should be possible without loss of biopotency. Thus, while retaining arginine-35 and the hydrophobic residues at positions 36/37/38 (leucine), the remaining amino acid residues within the C-terminal portion (residues 22–41) of h/rCRF were replaced by alanine or glutamine residues. This modification yielded an analogue of high biological potency (TableII), demonstrating that the amino acid residues of the middle portion (residues 22–33) of CRF are not individually essential for receptor interaction. From these results, the question arose as to whether this middle portion is essential at all for receptor activation. Combination of the urocortin N terminus (residues 1–19) via Ile-Glu and a highly flexible ε-aminocaproic acid (acp) residue with a mixed C-terminal site (residues 34–41) from members of the CRF family resulted in an analogue that exhibited full receptor activation (full intrinsic activity), but only at increased concentration (reduced biopotency) (Fig.1). Surprisingly, connection of the N-terminal to the C-terminal site via 1, 2, 3, or 4 acp residues produced only a slight difference in biopotency (Table II), showing that the length of the flexible connectors has little effect on agonistic potency.

Homologues of ORC subunits have been discovered among eukaryotes, and we have prepared monoclonal antibodies against a human homologue of ORC1 (hORC1) to study its localization in human cells. It was thus found to associate with nuclei throughout the cell cycle and to be resistant to nonionic detergent treatment, in contrast to MCM proteins, which are other replication factors, the association of which with nuclei is clearly dependent on the phase of the cell cycle. A characteristic feature of hORC1 is dissociation by NaCl in a narrow concentration range around 0.25 m, suggesting interaction with some specific partner(s) in nuclei. Nuclease treatment experiments and UV cross-linking experiments further indicated interaction with both nuclease-resistant nuclear structures and chromatin DNA. Although its DNA binding was unaffected, some variation in the cell cycle was apparent, the association with nuclear structures being less stable in the M phase. Interestingly, the less stable association occurred concomitantly with hyperphosphorylation of hORC1, suggesting that this hyperphosphorylation may be involved in M phase changes.

It is important to understand coordinated action of various proteins acting on specific cis-elements during initiation of chromosomal replication. In budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the origin recognition complex (ORC),1 composed of six polypeptides, is essential for initiation of DNA replication, binding specifically to replication origins throughout the cell cycle (1.Bell S.P.

Prior to the initiation of DNA replication, ORC forms a large protein complex, called a prereplicative complex, by association with other initiation factors, including CDC6 and MCM proteins. After the initiation of DNA replication, the prereplicative complex change to the postreplicative form as indicated by dissociation of factors from ORC in parallel with alteration of the ORC-DNA interaction (3.Diffley J.F.

Thus, dynamic change of DNA-protein complexes at replication origins in S phase appears to be closely connected with the initiation of DNA replication. The counterparts of prereplicative complex components, such as ORC, CDC6, and MCMs, have been identified in various eukaryotes. Thus, the basic mechanisms for initiation of DNA replication seem to be highly conserved. Putative ORC subunits constituting similar multiprotein complexes as that in S. cerevisiae have been identified inDrosophila (9.Gossen M. Pak D.T.S. Hansen S.K. Acharya J.K. Botchan M.

Recent studies have demonstrated that several events in nuclei, including DNA replication, take place in specialized compartments, in which specific factors assemble in highly organized structures. It is essential to ascertain the distribution of replication proteins among subcelluar fractions and their interactions to understand how DNA replication is initiated and otherwise regulated. The subcellular localization of MCMs has been well characterized in eukaryotes from yeast to mammalian cells; they associate with prereplicative chromatin and dissociate from it upon initiation of replication (5.Aparicio O.M.

CDC6 is in nuclei in G1 phase and transferred to the cytoplasm when cells enter into S phase. Change in localization of the two factors, MCMs and CDC6, implies a mechanism for prevention of rereplication of chromosomal DNA. In contrast, ORC in budding yeast associates with chromatin DNA in a sequence-specific manner throughout the cell cycle, suggesting that ORC functions as the landing pad for CDC6, MCMs and other factors to form prereplicative complex (3.Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 5.Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P.

Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The cellular localization of ORC in higher eukaryotes has not yet been elucidated in detail except for theXenopus case, in which ORC dissociates from metaphase chromatin in an egg extract cell-free system (13.Rowles A. Chong J.P.J. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 32.Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the mRNA expression of ORC1 is cell cycle-regulated by an E2F responsible promoter like that of CDC6 (18.Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Leone G. Herendeen D.R. Kelly T.J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6977-6984Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, the abundance of Drosophila ORC1 protein changes with the development stage and the cell cycle, accumulating in proliferating cells in G1/S (33.Asano M. Wharton R.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2435-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ectopic expression of ORC1 during Drosophila development alters the proliferation program, suggesting that ORC1 is a main contributor to cell cycle regulation (33.Asano M. Wharton R.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2435-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast to ORC1, expression of ORC2–5 seems not be cell cycle regulated in human cells (21.Quintana D.G. Hou Z. Thome K.C. Hendricks M. Saha P. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 7: 28247-28251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22.Quintana D.G. Thome K.C. Hou Z. Ligon A.H. Morton C.C. Dutta A. J.

Thus, although ectopic expression of ORC1 in mammalian cells does not drive cells into S phase (18.Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Leone G. Herendeen D.R. Kelly T.J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6977-6984Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), ORC1 may be one of limiting factor for initiation of their replication (34.Quintana D.G. Dutta A. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 805-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidation of its precise localization and dynamics in human cells should help uncover roles of the ORC complex in chromosomal DNA replication. This was the aim of the present cell fractionation and immunostaining study with a newly prepared anti-human ORC1 monoclonal antibody. HeLa S3 and normal human fibroblast WI38 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). For synchronization, exponentially growing HeLa S3 cells were arrested at M phase for 24 h with 150 ng/ml of TN16 (WAKO, Osaka, Japan) or with 2.5 mm of thymidine at the S phase for 24 h. For double thymidine blocking, HeLa S3 cells were incubated with 2.5 mm of thymidine for 24 h twice with an intervening 12 h of incubation without thymidine. WI38 cells were synchronized by serum starvation. In this experiment, 30% confluent WI38 cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for 36–48 h and then released from the starvation by addition of 10% FCS. The cell cycle synchronizations were checked by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson) after propidium iodide staining with a Cycle Test kit (Becton Dickinson). The adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line, 293, was grown, and its cellular proteins were fractionated as described previously (35.Stillman B.W. Gluzman Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1985; 5: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). HeLa and WI38 cell extracts were prepared essentially as detailed earlier (36.Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J.

Aliquots of 5 × 106 cells in 100-mm dishes were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 1 ml of 0.1% TX-100mCSK for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation (3000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C), the debris was washed once more with the same volume of ice-cold 0.1% TX-100mCSK. For DNase I or NaCl extraction, the debris from the second 0.1% TX-100mCSK extraction was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 0.1% TX-100mCSK supplemented with indicated amounts of NaCl or DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated further at the indicated temperature. After incubation, insoluble and soluble materials were separated by centrifugation. The chromatin DNA retained after this DNase I treatment was isolated from the insoluble fraction by treatment with 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml RNase A in 0.1% TX-100mCSK at 37 °C for 30 min followed by 2 h incubation with Protease K (200 μg/ml). The DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform (1: 1), precipitated with ethanol, separated by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose, and quantified with an image analyzer (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). Hybridoma cell lines were prepared from Balb/c mice after immunization with synthetic 15-amino acid polypeptides from within the human ORC amino acid sequence. Clones were screened by their reactivity against a recombinant human ORC1 (hORC1) protein (amino acids 1–698) tagged with His6 at the N terminus (His hORC1N) by immunoblotting. Two positive clones, 3C1B (producing IgM) and 3A2A (producing IgG1) were obtained and used in this study. Rabbit anti-murine MCM3 (mMCM3) antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. H. Kimura (Oxford University). This antibody recognized the corresponding human homologue on immunoblotting (25.Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Goat anti-lamin B antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For immunoprecipitation of hORC1, anti-hORC1 antibody (3A2A) was added to 0.2 m NaCl extracts of HeLa S3 cells as described above at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. After 8 h incubation at 4 °C, protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the mixture at 20 μl resin/ml, and incubation was continued for an additional 2 h. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 min, the precipitated beads were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (30 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) + 0.1% Tween 20. To test the shift of hORC1 by phosphorylation, the immunoprecipitate was treated with λ phosphatase (20 units/μl; New England Biolabs) in 1× λ phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and the products were separated by SDS-PAGE. All procedures were performed at room temperature except for blocking at 4 °C. Samples were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a semidry transfer apparatus in transfer solution (100 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.3) at 3 mA/cm2 for 60 min. After blocking of membranes, achieved with Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20 containing 10% dry milk (SNOW Brand, Sapporo, Japan) at 4 °C overnight, they were incubated first with antibodies in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20 containing 20% FCS for 1 h, followed by peroxidase-labeled second antibodies in the same solution for 1 h. Antibody reactive protein bands were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All procedures were carried out at room temperature. Cells on cover glasses were washed with CSK buffer without Triton three times, and fixed with 2.5% formalin solution in CSK for 10 min. After three washes with CSK, the fixed cells were incubated with PBS containing 10% FCS and 0.1% Triton for 30 min, for masking and permeabilization. Following a further three washes with 10% FCS in PBS, the cover glasses were incubated with the culture supernatant of clone 3C1B for 1 h, washed with 10% FCS in PBS three times, and incubated with Rhodamin-conjugated second antibody (MBL, Nagoya, Japan; reactive with both IgM and IgG) and 0.02 μg/ml of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in PBS containing 10% FCS for 1 h. After washing with PBS four times, the samples were mounted on slide glasses, and fluorescent signals were visualized with a Leica DMRBE and captured with a Photometrics PXL. HeLa S3 cells grown in 100-mm dishes (5 × 106 cells) were washed twice with PBS and irradiated with UV at the indicated doses in an UV chamber (Spectronics Corp., Westbury, NY) in 10 ml of PBS. The cells were lysed in 500 μl of 0.1% TX-100mCSK at 4 °C for 10 min, and the insoluble fraction was obtained after centrifugation. NaCl extracts were prepared as described under “Fractionations of Cellular Proteins,” above. We have developed hybridoma cell lines expressing antibodies 3A2A and 3C1B against specific oligopeptides of the hORC1 protein. Because they were screened for a recombinant hORC1 fragment produced in Escherichia coli (containing amino acids 1–698), it was necessary to test whether they could detect hORC1 protein specifically in human cell lysates. When we applied 1 × 105 HeLa cells to an immunoblot analysis, a major protein band of 97 kDa could be detected with monoclonal antibodies 3A2A (Fig.1 A) and 3C1B (data not shown). As the molecular mass of the detected band was in good agreement with the predicted molecular mass of hORC1, it was concluded that these antibodies specifically recognize hORC1 protein. Next we estimated the amount of hORC1 in human cells by the immunopurification method. First, the recovery of hORC by immunoprecipitation was calculated as follows. Cellular proteins from a fixed number of HeLa cells were prepared by using: 1) a total cell lysate obtained by SDS lysis, and 2) a soluble fraction obtained as an 0.2 m NaCl extract. About 50% of hORC1 in the total cell lysate was recovered in the latter soluble fraction (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). Because about 80% of hORC1 in the 0.2 mNaCl extract was recovered in the immunoprecipitated fraction (Fig.1 B, upper panel), 3A2A could precipitate the native hORC1 protein in the cell extract efficiently. Thus, 40% of the cellular hORC1 protein could be recovered by immunoprecipitation. When the immunoprecipitate from HeLa cells was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining, only a hORC1 band appeared other than the heavy and light chains of the IgG (Fig. 1 B, lower panel), indicating that hORC1 in the 0.2 m NaCl extract is mostly a single molecule entity. Using bovine serum albumin bands as the standard, we estimated that about 1 μg of hORC1 was recovered from 1 × 107 cells (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). Using the above factors for extraction and immunoprecipitation efficiencies, the cellular content of hORC1 was calculated to be approximately 1.6 × 106 molecules per HeLa cell. The subcellular localization of hORC1 was roughly studied with a cytoplasmic extract, 0.2 mNaCl nuclear extract, and the remaining cell debris from 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the majority of hORC1 was detected in the 0.2 m extract, suggesting a predominant localization in nuclei. It is known that nuclear proteins associated with some nuclear structures are retained in nuclei even after nonionic detergent treatment. When HeLa cells growing asynchronously and arrested in M phase by TN16 were treated with CSK buffer containing 0.1% Triton (0.1% TX-100mCSK), all hORC1 remained the insoluble fraction (Fig. 2 B). In contrast the other replication factors, MCMs were separated in two forms, soluble and insoluble, by this treatment (see Fig. 5 A). It is noteworthy that a mobility shift of hORC1 in SDS-PAGE was observed in M phase-arrested cells, suggesting some modification as described below.Figure 5hORC1 associates with both chromatin DNA and nuclease-resistant nuclear structures. Triton-treated HeLa S3 cells were incubated with 1000 units/ml of DNase I at 25 °C for the indicated period, in the presence of 1 mm ATP. Addition of ATP did not affect the results of ORC (data not shown). After centrifugation, the supernatant (sup) and the precipitate (ppt) fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with 3A2A antibody and anti-MCM3 antiserum (A). Chromatin DNA was purified from the precipitated fraction and analyzed on 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide (B, left panel). Amount of the DNA relative to the starting materials (Triton ppt) is shown in the right panel of B. λ phage DNA digested with HindIII was introduced intolane M. Living HeLa S3 cells on dishes were irradiated with UV at 50 (lanes 2 and 7), 100 (lanes 3and 8), 150 (lanes 4 and 9), and 200 mJ/cm2 (lanes 5 and 10) and subjected to successive extractions with Triton (lanes 1–5) and 500 mm NaCl (lanes 6–10) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” hORC1 and MCM3 were detected by immunoblotting (C). The intensity of each band was measured and the relative value using that of nonirradiated cells as 100% is indicated by the height of the bar (D). Standard evaluations were obtained from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Solubility of hORC1 in the Triton-insoluble fraction was studied with increasing concentrations of NaCl, as shown in Fig. 2 C. Interestingly, hORC1 was completely insoluble with 100 mmNaCl, whereas more than 90% of hORC1 became soluble with 250 mm NaCl. To obtain convincing evidence of nuclear localization of hORC1 by fractionation of cellular proteins, immunostaining of HeLa cells was performed with the 3C1B antibody. As shown in Fig.3, hORC1 was found in the nuclei in both unwashed (Fig. 3 A) and Triton-washed HeLa cells (Fig.3 B). However, after extraction with 250 mm NaCl, hORC1 signals could no longer be detected (Fig. 3 C), consistent with the cell fractionation experiments, indicating that hORC1 mainly exists in nuclei, but it efficiently dissociated at 0.25m NaCl. To investigate the localization of hORC1 during the cell cycle, synchronously growing WI38 cells were studied (Fig.4). Flow cytometric analysis revealed more than 90% of cells to be arrested once in G0 and to enter S phase at 20 or 24 h after serum addition (Fig.4 A). The total cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig.4 B), and hORC1 and MCM3 were detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 4 C). These results demonstrated hORC1 protein to begin to increase at 12–16 h, just before the onset of S phase, as also observed for MCM3 proteins. Using the same samples, retention of hORC1 in nuclei was tested by detergent treatment. As shown in Fig.4 D, all hORC1 existed in the insoluble fraction throughout the cell cycle except for partial release in the 16 h sample. Because the increase of hORC1 protein was greatest during 12–16 h, the soluble protein may correspond to newly synthesized molecules not yet imported into the nuclei. In line with a previous report (36.Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), about half of the MCM3 in cells became soluble with Triton, but the rest remained insoluble (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2and 3). Furthermore, the latter was released from nuclear debris, in parallel with solubilization of DNA by DNase I treatment, indicating a chromatin-bound nature (Ref. 36.Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar; Fig. 5, A, lanes 4–11, and B). Association of MCMs with chromatin DNA was also demonstrated by UV cross-linking experiments, as shown in Fig.5, C and D. The chromatin-bound MCM3, soluble on 0.5 m NaCl treatment (Ref. 36.Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar; data not shown), became insoluble upon UV irradiation in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 5,C, lanes 6–10, and D). The dose required to make half of the MCM3 insoluble was calculated to be 100 mJ/cm2. On the other hand, the MCM3 in the Triton-soluble fraction was scarcely cross-linked in this UV range (Fig. 5, C, lanes 1–5, and D). All hORC1 was soluble in 0.5m NaCl before UV irradiation (Fig. 2 C), becoming insoluble in a UV dose-dependent manner even in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl, like the Triton-insoluble MCM3 (Fig. 5, C and D). It has been reported that only proteins that associate directly with DNA could be cross-linked by UV (37.Carr A. Biggin M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1598-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, these results suggest that most MCM3 and the hORC1 retained in nuclei after Triton washing are linked"

When incubated in physiological ionic conditions, decorin-coated collagen bound only small amounts of native and oxidized LDL, the interaction being weak. When decorin-coated collagen was first allowed to bind lipoprotein lipase (LPL), binding of native and oxidized LDL increased dramatically (23- and 7-fold, respectively). This increase depended on strong interactions between LPL that was bound to the glycosaminoglycan chains of the collagen-bound decorin and native and oxidized LDL (kDa 12 and 5.9 nm, respectively). To distinguish between binding to monomeric (inactive) and dimeric (catalytically active) forms of LPL, affinity chromatography on heparin columns was conducted, which showed that native LDL bound to the monomeric LPL, whereas oxidized LDL, irrespective of the type of modification (Cu2+, 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride, hypochlorite, or soybean 15-lipoxygenase), bound preferably to dimeric LPL. However, catalytic activity of LPL was not required for binding to oxidized LDL. Finally, immunohistochemistry of atherosclerotic lesions of human coronary arteries revealed specific areas in which LDL, LPL, decorin, and collagen type I were present. The results suggest that LPL can retain LDL in atherosclerotic lesions along decorin-coated collagen fibers.

Mottino G. Fogelman A.M. Frank J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1151-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ultrastructural analysis of this association revealed that the LDL actually interacted with small filaments extending perpendicularly from the collagen fibers (1.Nievelstein-Post P. Mottino G. Fogelman A.M. Frank J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1151-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and electron microscopic analyses of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in the arterial intima have shown that these filaments are the GAG of collagen-binding dermatan sulfate-rich proteoglycans (PG) (2.Völker W. Schmidt A. Buddecke E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that decorin, a small collagen-binding dermatan sulfate-rich PG, can link native LDL to decorin-coated collagen immobilized to microtiter wells (3.Pentikäinen M.O. Öörni K. Lassila R. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7633-7638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which depends on the relatively weak interaction between apoB-100 of LDL and the GAG of decorin. A fraction of the LDL particles that have entered the arterial intima become modified, e.g. oxidized. The presence of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) in the arterial intima has been demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (4.Haberland M.E. Cheng L. Fong D. Science. 1988; 241: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 5.Rosenfeld M.E. Palinski W. Ylä-Herttuala S. Butler S. Witztum J.L. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 336-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), and, moreover, LDL isolated from the arterial wall shares characteristics with LDL oxidized in vitro (6.Ylä-Herttuala S. Palinski W. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study of cholesterol-fed miniature pigs has even suggested that virtually all of the LDL in the arterial intima is oxidized (7.Holvoet P. Theilmeier G. Shivalkar B. Flameng W. Collen D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). OxLDL is thought to be taken up rapidly by cells via the scavenger receptor(s), but the ability of oxLDL to generate foam cells, at least in vitro, has been questioned (8.Tabas I. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Some of the epitopes for oxLDL in the arterial intima are found in acellular areas rich in connective tissue and appear to be associated with the matrix (5.Rosenfeld M.E. Palinski W. Ylä-Herttuala S. Butler S. Witztum J.L. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 336-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). LPL, in addition to its catalytic role as the key enzyme involved in the intravascular metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, has been shown to have a noncatalytic function. Thus, LPL has been shown to link lipoproteins to the LDL receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor, to the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, and to PG, as reviewed (9.Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPL is synthesized in catalytically active homodimeric form, but, in the absence of stabilizing compounds, it rapidly dissociates into inactive monomers in vitro (10.Osborne J.C.J. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S. Olivecrona T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Inactive LPL is also presentin vivo. Indeed, a significant proportion of LPL in tissues is present as inactive monomers (11.Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is of interest that both dimeric and monomeric LPL are present in plasma, the former being primarily associated with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (12.Zambon A. Schmidt I. Beisiegel U. Brunzell J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2394-2404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the latter with cholesterol-rich lipoproteins (13.Vilella E. Joven J. Fernández M. Vilaró S. Brunzell J.D. Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1555-1564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although linking of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (VLDL) and cholesterol-rich lipoproteins (LDL) to the extracellular matrix and to the cell surface by LPLin vitro has been studied extensively (14.Saxena U. Klein M.G. Vanni T.M. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 15.Saxena U. Ferguson E. Auerbach B.J. Bisgaier C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1998; 252: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the studies have not evaluated the possibility that the monomeric and dimeric forms of LPL might be different in their ability to bind lipoproteins. Here, we studied the interaction between oxLDL and decorin-coated collagen in the absence and presence of LPL. We found that LPL, by binding to decorin, could anchor both oxidized and native LDL to decorin-coated collagen with high affinity. The interactions of native and oxLDL with LPL were studied further, using affinity chromatography on heparin columns loaded with LPL, a method that enabled us to study the binding of various apoB-100-containing lipoproteins separately to dimeric and to monomeric LPL. Finally, to assess the relevance of the present in vitro observations to human atherosclerosis, we studied the ultrastructural localization of LPL with regard to LDL, oxLDL, decorin, and collagen in human atherosclerotic lesions. PG were isolated from bovine fetal skin exactly as described (3.Pentikäinen M.O. Öörni K. Lassila R. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7633-7638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The GAG composition consisted of 63% dermatan sulfate, 12% chondroitin 6-sulfate, and 25% chondroitin 4-sulfate. NH2-terminal sequencing showed that this PG preparation contained more than 90% of decorin. 35S-Labeled decorin was prepared by labeling the core protein of decorin with 35S-labeling reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the Bolton-Hunter procedure (21.Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). Chondroitinase ABC-treated decorin was prepared by incubating 30 μg of35S-decorin with 250 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) in 100 μl of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland) containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) for 18 h at 37 °C. Degradation of the GAG chain of decorin was confirmed by loss of electrophoretic mobility of decorin on cellulose acetate (Helena Biosciences, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear, U. K.). The amounts and concentrations of decorin are expressed in terms of protein. Human VLDL, IDL, and LDL were isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers by sequential ultracentrifugation (22.Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and dialyzed extensively against buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Apolipoproteins of these lipoproteins were tritiated by the Bolton-Hunter procedure (21.Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar) with N-succinimidyl-[2,3-3H]propionate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to yield [3H] VLDL, [3H]IDL, and [3H]LDL and iodinated by the iodine monochloride method as described by McFarlane (23.McFarlane A.S. Nature. 1958; 182: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar) and Bilheimeret al. (24.Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). LDL was also labeled with [3H]cholesteryl linoleate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described (25.Piha M. Lindstedt L. Kovanen P.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10120-10129Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), to yield [3H]CL-LDL. LDL was oxidized in four different ways. 0.5 mg/ml [3H]LDL was incubated with (i) 5 μm copper sulfate in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 18 h or the indicated period of time; (ii) with 25 mm2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride (AAPH; Polysciences, Warrington, PA) in buffer A for 18 h at 37 °C, after which AAPH was removed from the sample on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated, and eluted with buffer A; (iii) with freshly prepared 0.8 mm hypochlorite (YA-Kemia, Helsinki, Finland) in buffer A for 15 min on ice; or (iv) 0.1 mg/ml [3H]LDL was incubated with 10,000 units/ml soybean 15-lipoxygenase (type V; Sigma) in buffer A for 18 h at 37 °C. [3H]CL-LDL was acetylated by treatment with acetic anhydride (26.Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The degree of LDL modification was monitored by the change in electrophoretic mobility on either cellulose acetate or on agarose gel (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) relative to native LDL. [3H]LDL and [3H]CL-LDL (1 mg/ml in buffer A) were proteolyzed with either 100 μg/ml α-chymotrypsin (Sigma) or plasmin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 6 h. The proteolyzed native-sized LDL was reisolated by chromatography on an A-5m column (40 × 1 cm; Bio-Rad), and fragmentation of apoB-100 was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol (27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The amounts and concentrations of lipoproteins are expressed in terms of protein. Protein was determined by the procedure of Lowry et al. (28.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with BSA as standard. LPL was isolated from fresh bovine milk by the intralipid binding method, essentially as described by Posner et al. (29.Posner I. Wang C.-S. McConathy W.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 226: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The isolated LPL migrated as a single major band at ∼55 kDa in 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and, with [3H]triolein (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as substrate (30.Saxena U. Witte L.D. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4349-4355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was found to have an activity of ∼5 mmol of oleic acid released/h/mg. The isolated LPL was stored in 30% glycerol at −20 °C. LPL was dissociated into monomers either by incubation with 1 m guanidinium HCl for 1 h at room temperature (31.Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 102-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or by incubation as dilute solution (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C (32.Lucas M. Iverius P.-H. Strickland D.K. Mazzone T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13000-13005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of heparin-bound LPL was inhibited treating an LPL-loaded heparin column with 100-fold molar excess of tetrahydrolipstatin (Orlistat®, Hoffmann La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) over LPL in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmdeoxycholate, 0.1 mm linoleate, pH 8.5, for 1 h at room temperature essentially as described (31.Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 102-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Microemulsions of LDL lipids were produced essentially as described (33.Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Briefly, LDL (6 mg) was delipidated (34.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar), and a trace amount of [3H]CL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the lipids. The lipids were dried under N2, 2.5 ml of buffer A was added, and the mixture was sonicated (Branson model B15P with “L” converter, position 4, Danbury, CT) at 40 °C under N2 for 6 × 5 min. The microemulsions were applied to a PD-10 column equilibrated and eluted with buffer A. To produce LDL-sized particles, egg yolk phosphatidylcholine and a trace amount of [14C]phosphatidylcholine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were sonicated for 2 h at 50 °C. Thereafter, LDL-sized vesicles were isolated by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose HR 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Microtiter wells (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) were incubated with decorin (10 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline at 37° for 18 h, or LPL (10 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol at 4 °C for 3 h, or fibrillar collagen type I from calf skin (100 μg/ml; Sigma) in 67 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 37 °C for 18 h. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation at room temperature for 1 h with 250 μl of buffer B (140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 30 mg/ml BSA). Microtiter well assays were performed by incubating the compound to be tested in 50 μl of buffer A at room temperature for 1 h. BSA-coated wells served as controls for nonspecific binding. In some experiments, the wells were preincubated sequentially with the indicated concentrations of decorin and LPL for 1 h at room temperature and washed twice with 250 μl of buffer B between incubations. Unbound compounds were removed by aspirating the incubation medium, and the wells were then rinsed three times with 250 μl of buffer B. The wells were detached, and their radioactivities were determined by liquid scintillation counting. The data points shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 5 indicate ligand specifically bound to the compound(s) tested, which was calculated by subtracting the amounts of ligand bound to the BSA-coated wells from the amounts of ligand bound to the wells coated with the compound(s) tested. The former values were <10% of the latter ones.Figure 2Effect of LPL on the binding of native and copper-oxidized LDL to collagen in the absence and presence of decorin. Microtiter wells coated with collagen or BSA were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 50 μl of buffer A containing 100 μg/ml decorin, washed, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 10 μg/ml LPL, washed, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 10 μg/ml native or copper-oxidized125I-LDL. The wells were washed, and the bound lipoproteins in individual wells were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. As controls, decorin, LPL, or both decorin and LPL were omitted. Values are means of duplicate incubations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Affinity chromatography of LDL proteolyzed by α-chymotrypsin (panel A) or by plasmin (panel B) on LPL-loaded heparin columns, affinity chromatography of LDL microemulsions on heparin columns in the absence and presence of LPL (panel C), and binding of LDL microemulsions to LPL adsorbed to microtiter wells (panel D). LDL proteolyzed with α-chymotrypsin (panel A) or plasmin (panel B) was analyzed by affinity chromatography on heparin columns loaded with 100 μg of LPL as described in the legend to Fig.3 and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (insets). LDL was delipidated, and microemulsions were prepared of the LDL lipids containing trace amounts of [3H]CL by sonication in aqueous buffer. Elution of the microemulsions from a heparin column (●) and from a heparin column loaded with 100 μg of LPL (▪) is shown in panel C. Panel D shows binding of the microemulsions (50,000 dpm) to LPL (0.5 μg) adsorbed to microtiter wells at the indicated NaCl concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding of VLDL, IDL, and native and modified LDL, and microemulsions to 1-ml heparin-Sepharose columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was studied in the absence and presence of native and inactivated LPL. Native or inactivated LPL (100 μg, diluted 1:5 with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 30% glycerol) was first injected into the column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. In some experiments, inactive forms of LPL were removed from the column by washing it with buffer containing 1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After re-equilibration to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, tritiated lipoproteins (10 μg) were injected into the column and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0 → 2 m) in 20 mmTris-HCl in 10 min. 500-μl fractions were collected, and aliquots of the fractions were analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation counting and for triglyceride lipase activity as described above. The NaCl concentrations of fractions from three independent runs were determined with a refractometer against NaCl standards, and the consistency of the gradients was monitored by conductometry. Samples of coronary arteries were obtained from four human hearts explanted at cardiac transplantation and snap frozen in OCT compound (Miles, Elkhard, IN); serial frozen sections were then cut at 5 μm. Samples were either stained with Oil Red O or prepared for immunohistochemistry. The antibodies used for immunohistochemistry were MB-47 for apoB-100 (dilution 1:100; a kind gift of Dr. J. Witztum, University of California, San Diego), MDA2 for malondialdehyde-modified lysine residues (1:100; produced in the Immunology core laboratory of the La Jolla SCOR program, a kind gift of Dr. J. Witztum), 5D2 for LPL (1:100; a kind gift of Dr. J. Brunzell, University of Washington), LF-30 for decorin core protein (1:100, a kind gift of Dr. L. Fisher, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIH), MAB1340 for collagen type I (1:10, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Acetone-fixed sections were stained with standard protocols using the indirect immunoperoxidase method with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or biotinylated goat anti-rabbit and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin detecting antibodies (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) for mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies, respectively. 3-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma) was used as chromogen. The interaction between LDL and decorin was first studied in microtiter wells coated with decorin. Under physiological ionic conditions and in the absence of LPL, binding of native LDL was low and not saturable (Fig. 1 A). But when the immobilized decorin was first preincubated with purified LPL from bovine milk at 10 μg/ml and the unbound LPL removed, the binding of LDL to decorin increased strongly. Scatchard analysis of this interaction revealed an association constant of 11.7 ± 2.9 nm (mean ± S.D., n = 3). Oxidation of LDL by copper for 18 h, which resulted in an electrophoretic mobility of 1.7 ± 0.2 (n = 7) relative to native LDL on cellulose acetate (which corresponds to an electrophoretic mobility of 3.5 relative to LDL on agarose electrophoresis), effectively inhibited the interaction between LDL and decorin (Fig.1 B). However, preincubation of decorin with LPL at 10 μg/ml dramatically enhanced the interaction between oxLDL and decorin, yielding an association constant of 5.9 ± 1.0 nm (n = 4). When LPL was directly immobilized to microtiter wells, both native and oxLDL bound strongly to the LPL (KD 12.3 nm and 5.3 nm, respectively), revealing that the presence of decorin did not markedly modulate the interactions between LPL and the two lipoproteins. When radiolabeled decorin was incubated with LPL immobilized to microtiter wells, the decorin bound to LPL with high affinity (KD 56 nm). Digestion of the GAG chain of decorin by chondroitinase ABC inhibited this binding by more than 90%, revealing that decorin interacts with LPL via its GAG chain. Fig. 2 shows binding of both native and oxLDL to collagen under conditions of physiological ionic strength. Under these conditions, only minimal binding of LDL or oxLDL to collagen or decorin-coated collagen was observed. However, when LPL was first allowed to bind to the decorin-coated collagen, both native and oxLDL showed high affinity and saturable binding to the pretreated collagen. In three independent experiments, LPL increased the amount of LDL bound to decorin-coated collagen by 9-, 29-, and 64-fold and that of oxLDL by 4-, 6-, and 12-fold. Thus, it appears that LPL can associate with collagen only in the presence of decorin and can efficiently link both native and oxLDL to decorin-coated collagen. To gain further insight into the mechanisms of the interactions between native and oxLDL, LPL, and decorin, we performed affinity chromatography on a heparin column in the absence and presence of LPL. As a control, we also studied VLDL and IDL, which are known substrates for LPL. As shown in Fig. 3 A, in the absence of LPL, most of native LDL, IDL, and VLDL bound to the immobilized heparin, their elution peaking at 215, 180, and 120 mm NaCl, respectively. Consistent with previous results (35.Öörni K. Pentikäinen M.O. Annila A. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21303-21311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), oxidation of LDL with copper for 18 h resulted in decreased affinity of LDL for heparin and formation of a fraction not binding to heparin. Next, we loaded the heparin column with LPL and compared the elution of the above series of lipoproteins. As shown in Fig.3 B, elution of native LDL was markedly retarded, although it still eluted earlier than LPL activity. In contrast, IDL, VLDL, and oxLDL all bound tightly to the column and eluted at roughly the same time as the LPL activity. Similar results were obtained with decorin columns, although all of the studied components eluted at lower NaCl concentrations. Accordingly, in the absence of LPL, native LDL eluted at 50 mm NaCl, and oxLDL failed to bind to the column, whereas in the presence of LPL, native and oxLDL eluted at 600 and 800 mm NaCl, respectively. LPL activity eluted at 800 mm NaCl. To study the effect of different degrees of LDL oxidation on binding to LPL, we incubated LDL (0.5 mg/ml) with 5 μm copper sulfate for various times and studied its effect on the elution profiles from heparin columns loaded with LPL. As shown in Fig.3 C, inset, oxidation for 2 h resulted in ∼2-fold electrophoretic mobility on agarose gel relative to that of native LDL and degradation of apoB-100 into a range of large fragments when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (not shown). This degree of oxidation markedly increased the binding of LDL to LPL (Fig. 3 C) but, in contrast, had only a minor effect on the binding to heparin in the absence of LPL (not shown). As oxidation progressed, the affinity of oxLDL to LPL continued to increase until it partly coeluted with the active LPL. Progressive oxidation of LDL particles also progressively decreased their affinity for heparin in the absence of LPL (not shown; the effect of 18-h oxidation is shown in Fig. 3 A). We also studied the effects of oxidation with AAPH, hypochlorite, and soybean 15-lipoxygenase on the binding of LDL to LPL. Moreover, the oxidative modification of LDL lysines was mimicked by acetylation of LDL. As shown in Fig. 3 D, all of these modifications caused a significant increase in the affinity of LDL for LPL. Moreover, although the electrophoretic mobility of LDL differed among the different types of oxidation (Cu2+, hypochlorite, AAPH, soybean 15-lipoxygenase), all types of oxidation dose-dependently increased the electrophoretic mobility of LDL and dose-dependently increased their affinity for LPL. Additional experiments showed that oxidation of LDL by reagent peroxynitrite and modification of LDL by MDA increased the affinity of LDL for LPL, and this effect depended on the degree of modification (not shown). Previous studies have shown that inactive forms of LPL have a weaker affinity for heparin than has the catalytically active dimeric LPL (36.Lookene A. Chevreuil O. Østergaard P. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12155-12163Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The observed elution of native LDL from the heparin column loaded with LPL (both active and inactive) by increasing NaCl concentration before the elution of catalytically active LPL may have reflected release of the LDL from either the inactive form or the catalytically active form of LPL (43.Hendriks W.L. van Vark L.C. Schoonderwoerd K. Jansen H. Havekes L.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two alternatives, we compared the binding of native and of copper-oxidized LDL to heparin columns containing one or the other form of LPL. Fig.4 shows the elution profiles of native and copper-oxidized LDL in the absence (panel A) and presence (panel B) of LPL. Elution of LPL was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm and was found to be roughly similar both in the absence and presence of the added lipoproteins (not shown). LPL was found to elute in three separate peaks, the last of which was the active form of the enzyme (panel B). Incubation of LPL either with 1 m guanidinium HCl for 1 h at room temperature (panel C) or as a dilute solution (10 μg/ml LPL protein) for 1 h at 37 °C (not shown) resulted in total loss of LPL activity and disappearance of the peak corresponding to active LPL in heparin affinity chromatography (panel C). Loading of the heparin column with this inactivated enzyme retarded the elution of native LDL in a manner similar to the effect found with the LPL preparation containing both the inactive and the active forms of the enzyme (C versu"

We identified proteinase inhibitor 9, or PI-9, as being rapidly and strongly induced by estrogen in an estrogen receptor-positive human liver cell line (HepG2-ER7). Since PI-9 mRNA was also induced by estrogen in a human liver biopsy sample, PI-9 is a genuine estrogen-regulated human gene. PI-9 is a potent inhibitor of granzyme B and of granzyme B-mediated apoptosis. Estrogens induced PI-9 mRNA within 2 h, PI-9 mRNA levels reached a plateau of 30–40-fold induction in 4 h, and induction was not blocked by cycloheximide, indicating that induction of PI-9 mRNA is a primary response. The antiestrogen trans-hydroxytamoxifen was a partial agonist for PI-9 mRNA induction, whereas the antiestrogen ICI 182,780 was a pure antagonist. Western blot analysis showed that estrogen strongly increases PI-9 protein levels. Inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D resulted in identical rates of PI-9 mRNA decay in the presence and absence of estrogen. We isolated genomic clones containing the PI-9 promoter region, identified a putative transcription start site, and carried out transient transfections of PI-9-luciferase reporter gene constructs. The estrogen, moxestrol, elicited a robust induction from the PI-9-luciferase reporter. Mutational inactivation of three potential imperfect estrogen response elements in the PI-9 5′-flanking region had no effect on moxestrol estrogen receptor induction.

The levels of a few liver proteins including some coagulation factors, sex hormone binding globulin, angiotensinogen, somatomedin C, and apolipoprotein A are altered after oral administration of estrogen to women (1.Krattenmacher R. Knauthe R. Parczyk K. Walker A. Hilgenfeldt U. Fritzemeier K.H. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but in most cases the responses are relatively small, and it is not clear whether these are primary or secondary responses to estrogen. Since these few genes are unlikely to account for the physiologic effects of estrogen in liver, we used a differential display approach (2.Kanamori H. Shapiro D.J. Biotechniques. 1999; 26 (1010): 1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) to identify RNAs that were induced by estrogen. Differential display is distinguished from other methods in that it does not involve a preconceived idea of the genes or pathways likely to be regulated. Although early passages of the widely used HepG2 cells, a human hepatoblastoma cell line (3.Knowles B.B. Howe C.C. Aden D.P. Science. 1980; 209: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), contained ER (4.Tam S.P. Archer T.K. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1670-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this cell line subsequently lost receptor and became ER-negative. To restore ER expression, HepG2 cells were stably transfected to express ERα, which is the ER subtype normally found in liver (5.Kuiper G.G. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S.

Using these cells (termed HepG2-ER7), we identified proteinase inhibitor 9 (PI-9) as an estrogen-inducible gene. PI-9 is a potent inhibitor of the protease, granzyme B (6.Sun J. Bird C.H. Sutton V.

PI-9 inhibits apoptosis mediated by either purified granzyme B and perforin or by CTLs (7.Bird C.H. Sutton V.R. Sun J. Hirst C.E. Novak A. Kumar S. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6387-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Although PI-9 does not inhibit most caspases, it does inhibit caspase 4 (7.Bird C.H. Sutton V.R. Sun J. Hirst C.E. Novak A. Kumar S. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6387-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), a member of the caspase subfamily involved in the maturation of interleukins. Although the ability of PI-9 to modulate apoptosis mediated by CTLs and by NK cells make this an important system for study, this work represents the first study of the regulation of PI-9 gene expression. We demonstrate that PI-9 mRNA is rapidly and strongly induced by estrogen and that the induction of PI-9 transcription is a direct, primary, effect of estrogen. Since PI-9 mRNA was also induced by estrogen in several independently isolated ER positive lines of HepG2 cells and was induced by estrogen in a human liver biopsy specimen, PI-9 mRNA is one of a handful of human mRNAs shown to exhibit large, order of magnitude, increases as a primary response to estrogen. Although estrogen strongly induces transcription of a construct containing the PI-9 promoter region linked to a luciferase reporter gene, the estrogen induction of PI-9 transcription is not mediated by estrogen response elements in the PI-9 5′-flanking region. Differential display was modified and performed as we recently described (2.Kanamori H. Shapiro D.J. Biotechniques. 1999; 26 (1010): 1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Briefly, total cell RNA was prepared using guanidine thiocyanate extraction and centrifugation through cesium chloride (16.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16657) Google Scholar). Before reverse transcription, the RNAs were DNase-treated. Primer I (5′-TTGTTGTTAACTTGTTTA-3′) was used for reverse transcription, and the cDNAs were fractionated on a Bio-Rad Prep A purification column to remove the primer used for reverse transcription. Primer Q (5′-CAGCGGAGACAGAGGAAG-3′) was 5′-end-labeled using T4 kinase. Arbitrary primer AP02 (5′-GGGAAGCTTGCTAAGACTAGC-3′) was added to the reaction, and PCR was performed in a 25-μl reaction. The HepG2, human hepatoma cell line (Ref. 3.Knowles B.B. Howe C.C. Aden D.P.

Sager R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1613-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), except that the ER cDNA was from the HEGO plasmid (18.Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm Eagle's nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 10 nm ICI 164,384 during selection in 1000 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). Stable ER-expressing clones were identified by immunocytochemical and Western blot analyses (19.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1988Google Scholar) using anti-ER antibodies kindly provided by G. Greene (University of Chicago). Using a whole cell binding assay for tritiated 17β-estradiol, we determined that the HepG2-ER7 clonal isolate contains approximately 30,000 ER sites/cell. HepG2-ER7 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium,10% dextran-coated charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum. Three independent clones of HepG2 cells expressing FLAG epitope-tagged hERα were isolated using the bicistronic system essentially as we recently described for ER-positive HeLa cell lines (20.Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HepG2ER clones were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% dextran-coated charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum containing 800 μg/ml G418 and 50% HepG2-conditioned medium. cDNA coding for PI-9 was cloned by RT-PCR using the Takara RNA LA PCR kit (PanVera, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using total RNA from cells treated with 17β-estradiol, RT-PCR was carried out using PI-9 5′ (5′-GTGGCAGGCCCTGCATCA-3′) and 3′ (5′-CACCCTTTATGGCGATGA-3′) primers. The amplified PCR product (nucleotides 87–1240 of PI-9 cDNA, GenBank™ accession Number L40378) was subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and its identity was confirmed by sequencing. The plasmid was then digested with ScaI and used as a template for in vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase to generate an RNA probe containing 421 nucleotides of the PI-9 coding sequence (Fig. 1 B). Total cell RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) in combination with DNase treatment. 10 μg of total RNA was glyoxal-treated, run on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to a BIODYNE PLUS membrane (Pall, BioSupport Division, Port Washington, NY), and hybridized to either the RNA probe described above or to an actin probe used as an internal standard. Quantitation of PI-9 mRNA levels was either by PhosphorImager analysis or by densitometry of bands on x-ray film. This experiment was carried out with informed consent from the patient and approval by the Committee on Human Ethics of the University of Tokyo. The biopsy sample was washed in medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% CD-fetal bovine serum) then incubated for 5.5 h in medium either containing 1 μm moxestrol or lacking moxestrol. RNA was extracted, and 1 μg of RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR using the PI-9-specific primers described above in the section on Northern blotting and a β-actin primer pair (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The reverse transcription reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 50 min followed by 99 °C for 5 min and 5 °C for 5 min. The first PCR cycle was performed at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 28 PCR cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 48 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s. An aliquot (5%) of the RT-PCR product was run on a 0.8% agarose gel and photographed after staining with ethidium bromide. To prepare a polyclonal antibody to PI-9, an NcoI/ApaLI fragment encoding amino acids 41–315 was made blunt-ended, cloned into PET-21b (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI) that had been digested with SalI and NotI, and made blunt-ended. The fusion protein contained a T7-Tag at its N terminus and a His tag at its C terminus. After transformation, the protein was expressed in E. coli BL21DE3, and the protein was purified from inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions in one step using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). Crude serum from a rabbit immunized with the purified PI-9 fragment was fractionated by precipitation with 50% ammonium sulfate followed by 40% ammonium sulfate (19.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1988Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were broken by three freeze-thaw cycles followed by centrifugation at 45,000 revolutions/min for 20 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were carried out as described (19.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1988Google Scholar), and antibodies were detected using ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the manufacturer's protocol and following modifications. The membrane was blocked with 3% nonfat milk. Incubations with antibodies were for 1 h with a 30-min wash between incubations followed by a final wash for 1 h. 500,000 phage from a human λEMBL3 SP6/T7 genomic library derived from human peripheral blood leukocytes (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were grown, transferred to nylon filters (Micron Separations, Westboro, MA), and hybridized at 65 °C for 16 h in 10% dextran sulfate, .05m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1m NaCl, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The filters were washed at 65 °C in 1× SSC (0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) and 0.2% SDS followed by a 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS wash at 65 °C. The probe used for initial screening corresponded to nucleotides 53 to 1205 of the PI-9 cDNA, and the probe used for plaque purification of candidate-positive phage corresponded to nucleotides 53 to 297 (PI-9 cDNA sequence, GenBank™ accession number L40378). The probes were labeled by random hexamer priming with [α-32P]CTP (random-primed DNA-labeling kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After plaque purification, the PI-9 promoter was isolated from the phage by PCR and cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). Sequencing of the promoter was carried out using the BIG DYE terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer). The promoter sequence was deposited in GenBank™, (accession number AF200209). To confirm the identity of the transcription initiation site, we carried out RT-PCR using the primers shown in Fig. 6. 1 μg of total RNA from YT cells was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) with a primer corresponding to nucleotides 2015–2028 in the promoter sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF200209). PCR using one-quarter of the RT reaction as template was carried out using Taq polymerase (Life Technologies) with 3′ primers (described in the legend to Fig. 6) and the same 5′ primer used for the RT reaction, giving a ∼470-base pair product. RT-PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Mutations were generated using the Stratagene quick change kit. In each case the potential ERE sequence (see Fig. 7 legend) was mutated to a HindIII site in the context of the full-length promoter region in the pGL3 promoter plasmid. Because the promoter contains regions with high GC content, to increase the generation of full-length mutant DNAs, GC melt (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was added to 1m. Thermocycling parameters were altered from the manufacturer's protocol using an annealing temperature of 48 °C and an extension time of 12.5 min. The presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfections were performed using HepG2 cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies), 10% charcoal dextran-treated fetal bovine serum, and penicillin-streptomycin. Transfections were done in 6-well plates using calcium phosphate coprecipitation (21.Mattick S. Glenn K. de Haan G. Shapiro D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with 3.8 μg of PTZ18U as carrier DNA, 25 ng of pRLSV40 as an internal standard (Promega), 15 ng of CMVhER, and 100 ng of the indicated PI-9 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid. The PI-9 promoter region was cloned into theNheI and BglII sites of the PGL3 promoter plasmid (Promega). The promoter fragment was generated by PCR usingPfu turbo (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and primers containing either NheI or BglII restriction sites. After shocking the HepG2 cells with 20% glycerol, moxestrol was added to 10−8m. Cells were harvested 48 h after glycerol shock, and lysates were assayed using the dual luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturers protocol (Promega). HepG2-ER7 cells were maintained in 10−7m 17β-estradiol (E2) or ethanol vehicle for 48 h, the cells were harvested, and the RNAs were analyzed by differential display. The intensity of one band was markedly increased in the sample from E2-treated cells (Fig.1 A, arrow). The band was isolated from the gel, reamplified, subcloned into a plasmid vector, and sequenced. Data base analysis revealed that the clone was identical to nucleotides 286–440 of PI-9 mRNA (Fig.1 B). To determine whether PI-9 mRNA was truly estrogen-inducible, we treated the HepG2-ER7 cells with increasing concentrations of the estrogen, moxestrol, which liver cells metabolize more slowly than 17β-estradiol (22.Barkhem T. Andersson-Ross C. Hoglund M. Nilsson S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blotting using an RNA probe corresponding to the 3′-end of the PI-9 protein-coding region (Fig.1 B). In agreement with earlier reports (6.Sun J. Bird C.H. Sutton V. McDonald L. Coughlin P.B. De Jong T.A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27802-27809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 23.Sprecher C.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29854-29861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), two PI-9 mRNAs approximately 2.5 and 4.5 kilobases in length were detected (Fig. 1 C). PI-9 mRNA levels were quite low in the absence of moxestrol. Induction of both PI-9 mRNAs was readily detected at 1 nm moxestrol, and induction was maximal at 10 nm moxestrol. Although the low basal level of PI-9 mRNA makes precise quantitation difficult, quantitation of the RNA bands indicates that moxestrol induces PI-9 mRNA 30–40-fold. To determine if the moxestrol induction of PI-9 mRNA was a general property of HepG2 human hepatoma cells, we examined the ability of three additional lines of ER-positive HepG2 cells produced using a different protocol based on the production of a bicistronic ER mRNA (20.Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and prepared in a different laboratory than the one that isolated HepG2-ER7 cells. Moxestrol strongly induced PI-9 mRNA in all three ER positive HepG2 cell lines (data not shown). These studies employed a transformed, established human liver cell line. Although HepG2 cells are a widely used model for human liver, we wished to more directly examine the ability of moxestrol to induce PI-9 in human liver. A portion of a biopsy sample was obtained from a 61-year old female patient with a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis. Tissue samples were incubated with and without moxestrol, and RNA was isolated and analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig.2 B). For comparison, RT-PCR was also carried out using the same protocol on an RNA sample from control and moxestrol-treated HepG2 ER-7 cells (Fig. 2 A). Densitometric quantitation of the band from the actin internal standard indicated that the actin mRNA level was 1.4-fold higher in the moxestrol-treated biopsy sample than in the untreated control biopsy sample. PI-9 mRNA was virtually undetectable in the control minus moxestrol sample, and precise quantitation of its level by densitometry was therefore difficult. Moxestrol treatment increased the level of PI-9 mRNA by >5-fold. After correcting for the slight increase in the level of expression of the actin control, the fold induction of PI-9 by moxestrol in the human biopsy sample is at least 4-fold and may actually be much higher. These data demonstrate that estrogen induces PI-9 gene expression in human liver. To investigate the effects of antiestrogens on PI-9 gene expression, trans-hydroxytamoxifen or ICI 182,780 was added to the culture medium with and without moxestrol.Trans-hydroxytamoxifen acted as a partial agonist, inducing low levels of PI-9 mRNA and only partially blocking moxestrol-mediated induction of PI-9 mRNAs (Fig.3 A). These data are consistent with several reports that tamoxifen can be a partial agonist in human liver (22.Barkhem T. Andersson-Ross C. Hoglund M. Nilsson S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24.Love R.R. Wiebe D.A. Feyzi J.M. Newcomb P.A. Chappell R.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994; 86: 1534-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 25.Nabulsi A.A. Folsom A.R. White A. Patsch W. Heiss G. Wu K.K. Szklo M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). In contrast, a 100-fold excess of the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 completely blocked induction of PI-9 mRNAs by moxestrol (Fig. 3 B). These data demonstrate that an estrogen-ER complex is required for induction of PI-9 mRNAs. Dexamethasone did not induce PI-9 mRNA and had little or no effect on moxestrol induction of PI-9 RNA (Fig. 3 C). Steroid hormone-regulated genes are often classified by whether their expression is directly controlled by the hormone-receptor complex or whether their regulation is an indirect or secondary effect requiring prior expression of other hormone-regulated genes (reviewed in Ref. 26.Dean D.M. Sanders M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1489-1495PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the nature of the estrogen induction of PI-9 mRNA, we determined the time course of induction and the effect of blocking protein synthesis. The induction of PI-9 mRNA in HepG2-ER7 cells was detected as early as 2 h after the addition of moxestrol to the medium, and PI-9 mRNA levels reached a plateau within 4 h (Fig. 4 A). When moxestrol was present, the fully induced level of PI-9 mRNA was maintained for at least 48 h (Fig. 4 A). The rapid metabolism of E2 by liver cells enabled us to examine the decline in PI-9 mRNA on removal of E2 from the culture medium. After removal of E2 from the culture medium, PI-9 mRNA levels declined rapidly, returning to near basal levels in 24 h (Fig.4 B), indicating that continuous exposure to estrogen is required for maintaining the induced level of PI-9 mRNAs. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide resulted in superinduction of PI-9 mRNA, a phenomenon observed with numerous mRNAs (27.Aste-Amezaga M. Ma X. Sartori A. Trinchieri G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5936-5944PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Roger T. Out T. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Jansen H. Lutter R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cycloheximide did not block the estrogen-mediated induction of PI-9 mRNA. When E2 and cycloheximide were both present, PI-9 mRNA levels were high and were approximately the levels expected if E2 and cycloheximide exhibited additive effects (Fig. 4 C). The unusually rapid induction of PI-9 mRNA and the inability of cycloheximide administration to block induction indicate that the induction of PI-9 mRNA is a direct or primary effect of estrogen. In addition to its widely studied ability to increase rates of gene transcription, estrogen can act posttranscriptionally to alter mRNA stability (29.Brock M.L. Shapiro D.J. Cell. 1983; 34: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To examine the decay of PI-9 mRNA in the presence and absence of estrogen, we employed the most widely used method for analyzing mRNA degradation, inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D. After actinomycin D treatment, the rate of PI-9 mRNA decay was the same when the cells were maintained in the presence and absence of estrogen (Fig. 5). Since actinomycin D can sometimes induce artifacts in the measurement of mRNA decay rates (30.Attardi B. Winters S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 668-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31.Laufs U. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24266-24271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar), it was important to confirm these data using another inhibitor of RNA synthesis. Estrogen also failed to alter the half-life of PI-9 mRNA when 100 μm 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside was used to inhibit RNA synthesis (data not shown). We therefore conclude that estrogen does not stabilize PI-9 mRNA. Although cellular PI-9 mRNA is strongly estrogen-inducible and the data of Fig. 5indicates that estrogen does not increase the stability of PI-9 mRNA, it was important to directly test the idea that estrogen induces PI-9 gene transcription. We therefore screened a human phage library, isolated genomic PI-9 clones, and sequenced the promoter region. To determine the transcription initiation site, we carried out an initial primer extension analysis, which suggested that PI-9 mRNA contained a long ∼480-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region. The unusually high GC content of the proposed 5′-untranslated region made it impossible to carry out primer extension using primers closer to the putative start site (data not shown). We therefore identified a candidate transcription start site by comparison to consensus transcription initiation elements and confirmed its identity by RT-PCR using 5′ primers just upstream and just downstream of the putative start site. The putative transcription initiation region contained all three elements known to specify a eukaryotic transcription start site, a TATA box, an initiator element, and a downstream promoter element (DPE) (boxed sequences, Fig.6). The TATA box and the initiator sequence differ from their respective consensus sequences by one nucleotide, and the DPE contains the consensus GACG sequence. In addition, the spacing of these three elements strongly suggests that they are functional. The TATA box and initiator are 27 nucleotides apart, and the DPE is 32 nucleotides downstream of the initiator. Since functional vertebrate initiator elements are usually 25–30 nucleotides downstream of the TATA box (32.Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and functional DPEs are 28–34 nucleotides downstream of the initiator (32.Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), the TATA box, initiator, and DPE are correctly spaced to form a functional PI-9 initiation site. To confirm the location of the initiation site, we used a method we described previously (33.Lee J.H. Kim J. Shapiro D.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in which PCR is carried out with primers just upstream and just downstream of the candidate site. If the transcription start site has been correctly identified, the sequence corresponding to the upstream primer will not be reverse-transcribed into cDNA and will not yield a PCR product. PCR using the downstream primer, which should hybridize to a transcribed sequence, should result in a"

Binding interactions between Atp11p and the entire β-subunit of F1 or fragments of the β-subunit were also revealed by a yeast two-hybrid screen: Atp11p bound to a region of the nucleotide-binding domain of the β-subunit located between Gly114 and Leu318. Certain elements of this sequence that would be accessible to Atp11p in the free β-subunit make contact with adjacent α-subunits in the assembled enzyme.

The enzyme is a large protein complex composed of two oligomeric units: an integral membrane component (F0) and a peripherally bound catalytic moiety (F1). F1 that is bound to the membrane sector catalyzes both ATP synthesis and ATP hydrolysis in reactions that are coupled to proton translocation through F0 (1.Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol.

F1 contains five different types of subunits in the stoichiometric ratio α3:β3:γ:δ:ε (1.Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

X-ray diffraction studies have revealed the three-dimensional structure of mitochondrial F1 from bovine heart (3.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The α- and β-subunits alternate in a hexamer that surrounds a central helical structure composed of the N and C termini of the γ-subunit (3.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Three catalytic sites and three non-catalytic sites are located at the interfaces between α- and β-subunits (3.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar, 4.Bianchet M.A. Hulihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Previous work with respiratory-deficient strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shown that the F1 α-subunit aggregates in mitochondria of yeast lacking the β-subunit; likewise, the β-subunit aggregates in α-subunit null strains (5.Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, the α- and β-subunits can be recovered in soluble fractions when mitochondria are prepared from strains harboring a disrupted gene for the γ-subunit (6.Paul M.-F. Ackerman S. Yue J. Arselin G. Velours J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26158-26164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), δ-subunit (7.Giraud M.-F. Velours J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), or ε-subunit (8.Guelin E. Chevallier J. Rigoulet M. Guerin B. Velours J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 161-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), despite the fact that F1 does not assemble in the absence of any of these three subunits. Moreover, in a strain disrupted for the γ-subunit, the α- and β-subunits show evidence of forming hetero-oligomers (6.Paul M.-F. Ackerman S. Yue J. Arselin G. Velours J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26158-26164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, it would appear that if αβ complexes can form, the proteins remain soluble. If, on the other hand, only one of the “partner” subunits is present (e.g. in an α- or β-subunit null strain), the natural tendency of free α- or free β-protein to aggregate becomes apparent. Notably, the α- and β-subunits of F1 also aggregate in mitochondria of yeast carrying a nonfunctional allele of the ATP11 orATP12 gene (5.Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The fact that the biochemical properties of these mutant strains are similar to those of α- or β-subunit null strains suggests that the products of the ATP11 (9.Ackerman S.H. Martin J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7386-7394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) andATP12 (10.Bowman S. Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7517-7523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) genes are required to maintain the unassembled α- and β-subunits as soluble proteins during the early phase of enzyme assembly. As might be expected for proteins that bind free F1 subunits, which constitute a very small fraction of the total pool of F1 protein (11.Burns D.J. Lewin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12066-12073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Atp11p and Atp12p are present at a very low level in yeast mitochondria (9.Ackerman S.H. Martin J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7386-7394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Bowman S. Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7517-7523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the facts that Atp11p and Atp12p appear to function exclusively in F1 assembly (5.Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and do not share sequence homology with other proteins of known function, they can be considered as “F1-specific” assembly factors. Atp11p is a 31-kDa monomeric protein of the mitochondrial matrix with an overall basic charge (12.White M. Ackerman S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Previous work has localized the functional domain of Atp11p to a region in the middle of the protein that is characterized by two stretches of hydrophobic sequence (13.Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4887-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here we report results from coprecipitation experiments and yeast two-hybrid screens that probed for direct interactions between Atp11p and the F1 α- and β-subunits and conclude that Atp11p binds to the β-subunit only. The binding site for Atp11p was mapped within a sequence of 205 amino acids in the nucleotide-binding domain of the β-subunit. Coprecipitation experiments utilized yeast strain W303ΔG13 (MAT a ade2-1 his3-1,15 leu2-3,112 ura3-1 trp1-1 atp11::HIS3) (9.Ackerman S.H. Martin J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

Escherichia coli RR1 (proA leuB lacY galK xyl-5 mtl-1 ara-14 rpsL supE hsdS λ−) was the host bacterial strain for the recombinant plasmid constructions. Yeast cells were grown in the following media: YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, and 1% yeast extract), YPGal (2% galactose, 2% peptone, and 1% yeast extract), EG (2% ethanol, 2% glycerol, 2% peptone, and 1% yeast extract), WO (2% glucose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids), and SD/−Leu,Trp,His (2% glucose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, supplemented with all essential amino acids and nucleotides except leucine, tryptophan, and histidine). Amino acids and other growth requirements were added at a final concentration of 20–150 μg/ml. The solid media contained 2% agar in addition to the components described above. The plasmids used in this study are described in Table I. Atp11p is numbered from residues 1 to 318 (9.Ackerman S.H. Martin J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7386-7394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the F1 β-subunit is numbered from residues 1 to 511 (15.Takeda M. Vassorotti A. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and the F1 α-subunit is numbered from residues 1 to 544 (16.Takeda M. Chen W.-J. Saltzgaber J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15126-15133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all cases, residue 1 is the initiator methionine in the primary translation products. The plasmids carrying partial segments of a gene and the encoded products are named according to the codons/amino acids that are retained in the constructs. Plasmid pAS2-1/ATP11-(40–318) carries a 860-bp1 NcoI-BamHI fragment prepared from pTRCATP11 (12.White M. Ackerman S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in pAS2-1 (CLONTECH). To make pACT2/ATP1-(35–544), a 1.6-kilobase BstXI (blunted)-DraI fragment carrying ATP1 DNA was first subcloned in the SmaI site of YEp352 (17.Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) and then prepared as an EcoRI (blunted)-BamHI fragment and ligated at the NcoI (blunted) and BamHI sites of pACT2 (CLONTECH). Plasmid pG1/ST13, which carries the entire ATP2 gene in the vector pRS316 (18.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used for construction of most of the ATP2 two-hybrid plasmids. Plasmid pACT2/ATP2-(101–511) carries a 1.25-kilobase KpnI (blunted)-XhoI fragment prepared from pG1/ST13 in theSmaI and XhoI sites of pACT2.

Plasmid pACT2/ATP2-(273–511) carries a 730-bp PvuI (blunted)-XhoI fragment prepared from pG1/ST13 in theSmaI and XhoI sites of pACT2. For construction of pACT2/ATP2-(382–511), plasmid pACT2/ATP2-(273–511) was digested withNcoI and BamHI and treated with Klenow enzyme, and the larger fragment was recircularized. Plasmid pACT2/ATP2-(319–511) carries a 600-bp MscI-XhoI fragment prepared from pG1/ST13 in the XmaI (blunted) andXhoI sites of pACT2. To construct pACT2/ATP2-(36–382), plasmid pACT2/ATP2-(36–511) was digested with BamHI andXhoI and blunt-ended with Klenow enzyme, and the resultant 9.1-kilobase fragment was recircularized. The termination codon for the insert in pACT2/ATP2-(36–382) is provided by vector sequence 27 nucleotides downstream from the 3′-end of the ATP2 DNA; there are 9 amino acids (LERSMNRRY) encoded by vector sequence fused to the carboxyl-terminal sequence of this β-subunit fragment. Plasmid pACT2/ATP2-(36–318) carries a 850-bp SfiI-MscI fragment prepared from pACT2/ATP2-(36–511) in the SfiI andSmaI sites of pACT2. The termination codon for the insert in pACT2/ATP2-(36–318) is provided in the vector 45 nucleotides downstream from the ATP2 DNA; there are 15 amino acids (GGSEFELERSMNRRY) encoded by vector sequence fused to the carboxyl terminus of this β-subunit fragment. The ATP2 inserts in the remaining plasmids were synthesized by PCR using plasmid pG1/ST13 as the template (unless indicated otherwise) with the primers listed in Table II. The forward and reverse primer pairs used to construct each plasmid are as follows: pACT2/ATP2-(289–511), β289–511-f and M13 #1233; pACT2/ATP2-(38–288), β38–288-f and β38–288-r (a 8.4-kilobaseNcoI fragment prepared from this plasmid was filled in with Klenow enzyme and religated to make plasmid pACT2/ATP2-(211–288)); pACT2/ATP2-(38–272), β38–288-f and β38–272-r; pACT2/ATP2-(38–253), β38–288-f and β38–253-r; pACT2/ATP2-(38–210), β38–288-f and β38–210-r; pACT2/ATP2-(38–116), β38–288-f and β38–116-r; pACT2/ATP2-(114–288), β114–288-f and β38–288-r; pACT2/ATP2-(114–272), β114–288-f and β38–272-r; pACT2/ATP2-(114–253), β114–288-f and β38–253-r; pACT2/ATP2-(114–210), β114–288-f and β38–210-r; and pACT2/ATP2-(153–288), β153–288-f and β38–288-r. PCR for pACT2/ATP2-(273–318) employed a plasmid template bearing a 140-bpNcoI-MscI fragment that was subcloned from pACT2/ATP2-(273–511) in the NcoI and SmaI sites of pACT2 with primers β273–318-f and β273–318-r. PCR for pACT2/ATP2-(289–318) used primers β289–511-f and β273–318-r with template pACT2/ATP2-(289–511). PCR for pACT2/ATP2-(273–288) used primers β273–318-f and β38–288-r with template pACT2/ATP2-(273–318).

Open table in a new tab Mitochondria were prepared as described (13.Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4887-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) from yeast strains aW303ΔG13/pG13/ST5 andaW303ΔG13/pG13/BTYEP, which produce native and biotin-tagged forms of Atp11p, respectively, from the 2μ vector YEp352. The mitochondria were suspended at 7 mg/ml (300-μl final volume) in TEA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, and 4 mm ATP) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and subjected to four 10-s bursts of sonic irradiation at full power (Branson Model 450 sonifier). The sonicated material was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti-70.1 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C to sediment the membranes. The soluble extracts (130 μl) were mixed with 50 μl of avidin-Sepharose beads and brought to a 200-μl final volume in either buffer A (TEA buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.14m NaCl) or buffer B (TEA buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, 0.14 m NaCl, and 2 mm biotin). The samples were rotated end-over-end at 4 °C for 30 min and subsequently centrifuged for 5 min (Beckman Microfuge) to sediment the avidin-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed three times by centrifugation with 400 μl of buffer A or buffer B (as appropriate), followed by an additional three washes with 400 μl of plain TEA buffer. The washed beads were suspended in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer in preparation for Western analysis. The proteins present in the initial post-bead supernatants were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and suspended in 80 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The yeast two-hybrid screen (19.Fields S. Song O.-K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4878) Google Scholar) employed yeast vectors pACT2 and pAS2-1 and host strain Y190 (described above) as supplied in the MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System 2 fromCLONTECH. Yeast were grown in SD/−Leu,Trp,His medium. Assays for β-galactosidase activity followed protocols described in the CLONTECH manual. Qualitative assessment of expression from the lacZ reporter gene was made using X-gal as a chromogenic substrate for β-galactosidase in a colony-lift filter assay. For quantitative determination of β-galactosidase activity, the absorbance at 420 nm ofo-nitrophenyl released from the substrateo-nitrophenyl β-galactoside was normalized to cell density measured at 600 nm and is reported in Miller units (20.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Standard techniques were used for restriction endonuclease analysis of DNA, purification and ligation of DNA fragments, and transformations and recovery of plasmid DNA fromE. coli (21.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Yeast transformations employed the LiAc procedure (22.Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). The method of Laemmli (23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar) was used for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blotting followed the procedure of Schmidt et al. (24.Schmidt R.J. Myers A.M. Gillham N.W. Boynton F.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1984; 1: 317-334PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against Atp11p, F1 α, and F1 β were used at dilutions of 1:1000, 1:2000, and 1:3000, respectively (5.Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 12.White M. Ackerman S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody against the transcriptional activation domain of Gal4p was purchased from CLONTECH and used at 0.4 μg/ml. Visualization of the protein bands in x-ray film was by chemiluminescence using the ECL system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Avidin-Sepharose resin was prepared by coupling native avidin (Sigma) to CNBr-activated Sepharose following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer of the resin beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Lowry et al.(25.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast transformed with plasmid pG13/BTYEP produce a form of Atp11p that carries a sequence for in vivobiotinylation at the C terminus of the protein (12.White M. Ackerman S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The tagged protein (Bt-Atp11p) is fully functional in F1 assembly (9.Ackerman S.H. Martin J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7386-7394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.White M. Ackerman S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and can be used in combination with avidin affinity resins in coprecipitation experiments aimed at identifying proteins that form complexes with Atp11p. For this purpose, soluble mitochondrial extracts, prepared from yeast cells that produce either native or biotinylated Atp11p, were incubated with avidin-Sepharose beads in the absence or presence of free biotin in the buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”). Western analysis of the post-bead supernatants (Fig.1) showed that the F1 α- and β-subunits were present in approximately equal amounts and that native Atp11p was more abundant than biotinylated Atp11p. In the bead precipitate from mitochondrial extracts containing native Atp11p, only background levels of Atp11p were detected compared with the strong signal for this protein in the supernatant. Moreover, there was no evidence that F1 α- or β-subunits were precipitated by the beads. In contrast, the bead precipitate from mitochondrial extracts containing biotinylated Atp11p showed significant amounts of both Bt-Atp11p and the F1 β-subunit. The specificity of this coprecipitation is attested by the fact that when precipitation was carried out in the presence of excess biotin, there was only a background level of Bt-Atp11p, and no F1 β-protein was detected in the bead precipitate. The absence of the α-subunit in the Bt-Atp11p precipitate suggests that this F1 protein either does not interact directly with Atp11p or forms only a very weak complex. The yeast two-hybrid assay was used to probe for binding interactions between Atp11p and the F1 α- and β-subunits. The plasmids employed in this work (Table I) encode only the mature sequences (i.e. without the mitochondrial leader sequences) of the Atp11p and F1 proteins fused to either the DNA-binding domain or the transcriptional activation domain of Gal4p. Combinations of these plasmids were used to transform a yeast host (Y190) that harbors lacZ under transcriptional control of Gal4p; the presence of β-galactosidase activity in such strains indicates that the two Gal4p fusion proteins interact. Initial screens for β-galactosidase involved exposing lysed cells to X-gal on filter paper. The amount of β-galactosidase activity was quantified in cell lysates prepared from blue colonies, using o-nitrophenyl β-galactoside as the substrate, and normalized to the cell density. The combination of plasmids producing Atp11p and the full-length F1 β-subunit (Ala36–Asn511) gave a positive signal in the two-hybrid assay (Fig.2). Negative control experiments showed there was no β-galactosidase activity in yeast harboring the Atp11p or F1 β-subunit plasmid alone or in combination with the appropriate partner vector lacking any insert. In similar experiments, we have not been able to find any evidence of binding between Atp11p and the F1 α-subunit (data not shown). This result is in accord with the fact that the α-subunit was not coprecipitated with Bt-Atp11p by avidin-Sepharose beads (see above). The two-hybrid system was used further to locate the binding site for Atp11p on the β-subunit. There are three domains in the mature β-subunit: a β-barrel at the N terminus, a central domain that contains the adenine nucleotide-binding site, and a helix bundle at the C-terminal end (3.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar, 4.Bianchet M.A. Hulihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2). The fragment Glu101–Asn511, which lacks almost the entire β-barrel, and the fragment Ala36-Asp382, which lacks the helix bundle, both scored positively for binding Atp11p in this assay. There was no evidence of Atp11p binding to the sequence for the β-barrel domain (Ala38–Ile116) or the helix bundle domain (Asp382–Asn511). Western analysis with antibodies against the Gal4p activation domain confirmed the presence of the non-interacting β-subunit fusion proteins in the yeast host (data not shown). The results from initial mapping studies indicated that the binding determinants for Atp11p are contained entirely within the nucleotide-binding domain of the β-subunit. To define the boundaries of the Atp11p-binding site, fragments of the β-subunit, deleted for sequence from the amino- or carboxyl-terminal end of the adenine nucleotide-binding domain, were tested for binding Atp11p in the two-hybrid assay. This analysis disclosed positive results for the fragments His211–Asn511, Ala273–Asn511, Asp289–Asn511, Ala36–Leu318, Gln38–Ile288, Gln38–Ile272, Gln38-Gly253, Gly114–Ile288, Gly114–Ile272, Gly114–Gly253, and Ala273–Leu318. The largest segment of β-subunit residues that can be removed from the N or C terminus of the protein without disrupting binding interactions with Atp11p occurs proximal to Gly114 and distal to Leu318, which suggests that the binding site for Atp11p is located between these 2 amino acids (Fig. 2, shaded box). The data also indicate that the structural elements recognized by Atp11p are distributed throughout this region since not all of the fragments that scored positive for binding overlap in sequence. Notably, there are a number of fragments that encompass portions of the sequence between Gly114 and Leu318 that did not show evidence for binding Atp11p. Western analysis confirmed that the Gal4p/β-subunit fusion proteins, which scored negatively in the assay, were produced in the yeast host (data not shown). On this basis, we suggest that the fragments Gln38–Ala210, Gly114–Ala210, His211–Ile288, Ala273–Ile288, Asp289–Leu318, and Asp153–Ile288 may not fold correctly, which could prevent their recognition by Atp11p. We have used two different methods to detect binding interactions between Atp11p and the α- and β-subunits of F1. First, avidin-Sepharose beads, which selectively bind biotinylated Atp11p in mitochondrial extracts, were shown to coprecipitate the F1β-subunit. Second, direct binding between Atp11p and the F1 β-subunit was demonstrated by means of a yeast two-hybrid screen. Neither the affinity precipitation assay nor the two-hybrid screen provided indications that Atp11p binds also to the F1 α-subunit. Additional work with the yeast two-hybrid screen has mapped the Atp11p-binding site to a sequence of 205 amino acids (Gly114–Leu318) located within the nucleotide-binding domain of the β-subunit (Fig. 2). It is of note that only certain fragments of this sequence bind the assembly factor. For example, binding was observed for the β-subunit sequence Gly114–Ile288, but not for its smaller fragments, Gly114–Ala210 and His211–Ile288. Similarly, the sequence Ala273–Leu318 scored positive for Atp11p binding, whereas the fragments Ala273–Ile288and Asp289–Leu318 did not. The β-subunit fragments that did not show evidence of binding Atp11p were detected in the cell by Western analysis in amounts comparable to those of the other fragments that did show evidence for binding the assembly factor. Thus, it would appear that other factors such as a correct folding are required for recognition and binding by Atp11p. This observation, together with the fact that atp11 mutants accumulate only the mature β-subunit (5.Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), whereas strains defective in mitochondrial protein folding (i.e. hsp60 (mif4) mutants) accumulate both the precursor and mature forms of the β-subunit (26.Cheng M.Y. Hartl F.-U. Martin J. Pollock R.A. Kalousek F. Neupert W. Hallberg R.L. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1989; 337: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), supports the view that Atp11p acts at a step downstream from Hsp60 and binds the folded form of the β-subunit. It is conceivable that Atp11p prevents the aggregation of unassembled β-subunits by shielding sequence elements that would cause nonproductive β/β interactions. The availability of structural information for bovine F1 from x-ray studies (3.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar) allows us to identify by homology modeling candidates for the sequence elements in the free β-subunit that are most likely to be protected by the assembly factor. The sequence Gly114–Leu318 of the yeast β-subunit, which we have shown to harbor binding determinants for Atp11p, is homologous to Ala80–Leu285 of the bovine F1β-subunit (3.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar). This region, which extends from β-strand 1 through the beginning of α-helix F in the nucleotide-binding domain of the bovine β-subunit, is colored in red in the ribbon diagram shown in Fig. 3 A. Within this segment of the β-subunit, several amino acid side chains are involved in intersubunit contacts with the adjacent α-subunits. This feature is illustrated in Fig. 3 B, which shows the secondary structural elements of the βDP-subunit sequence between Ala80 and Leu285 rendered as a schematic inred, the C-α traces of the adjacent αDP- and αE-subunits in cyan, and the amino acids at the interfaces between these subunits as stick models colored inyellow (contribution from the segment Ala80–Leu285 of the β-subunit) orblue (contribution from the adjacent α-subunits). The participation of the Atp11p-binding region in the formation of the contact surfaces between α- and β-subunits suggests that during assembly of the oligomer, the α-subunits may bind to the β-subunit in exchange for bound Atp11p. In consideration of the high tendency of β-subunit monomers to aggregate (5.Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), this type of action would ensure that the β-subunit is never present as a free protein in solution. Recent findings provide evidence that a similar mechanism (binding of Atp12p to the α-subunit) is adopted to prevent aggregation of the α-subunit during normal assembly of the enzyme. 2Z.-G. Wang, D. Sheluho, D. L. Gatti, and S. H. Ackerman, submitted for publication. In this context, of particular interest is the observation that in the absence of Atp11p, also the α-subunit aggregates inside mitochondria (5.Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). One possible explanation of this phenomenon is that whereas under normal conditions, the very small pool of unassembled α-subunit is maintained in solution via binding to Atp12p, under conditions in which the β-subunit aggregates (i.e. in atp11 mutants), a large amount of unassembled α-subunit is likely to accumulate in excess over the Atp12p protein. Thus, under these circumstances, also the α-subunit is expected to aggregate in the mitochondrial matrix. We thank Domenico Gatti for help in the preparation of Fig. 3 and for critical evaluation of the manuscript."

Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). All integrins are heterodimers of non-covalently associated α and β subunits. At the functional level, the interactions between integrins and their EM protein ligands involve the following: (i) the extracellular integrin heteromeric “head” that encompasses the N-terminal halves from both α and β subunits and hosts the ligand-recognition pocket with a variety of binding sites on each subunit (2.Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. Mecham R.P. Integrins: Molecular and Biological Responses to Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 1-32Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar); (ii) short specific amino acid sequences (adhesion motifs) from the EM ligands. The prototype for these adhesion motifs is the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence that is present in fibronectin, fibrinogen, vitronectin, and other EM-adhesive proteins (3.Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). The exact location of these binding loci in the integrin subunits, as well as their respective role on ligand binding energy and specificity, still remains an open question. The N-terminal half of the integrin α subunits is characterized by the presence of seven N-terminal repeats of about 60 amino acids each (4.Corbi A.L. Miller L.J. O'Connor K. Larson R.S. Springer T.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4023-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 5.Larson R.S. Corbi A.L. Berman C. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Some of the α subunits include an insertion domain, or I-domain, about 200 residues in length, between repeats II and III (2.Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. Mecham R.P. Integrins: Molecular and Biological Responses to Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 1-32Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The homologies between repeats I and VII essentially include the FG and GAP consensus sequences, so that these repeats are also referred as FG-GAP repeats (6.Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Three to four of these repeats (i.e. repeat IV or V to repeat VII) display sequences that resemble the EF-hand consensus sequence found in various divalent cation-binding proteins (7.Kawasaki H. Kretsinger R.H. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 343-517PubMed Google Scholar). However, the integrin EF-hand type sequences are systematically devoid of an acidic residue at their relative position 12, a highly invariant Glu residue in the typical EF-hands, that is replaced by a non-polar residue in integrins (8.Tuckwell D.S. Brass A. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Isolated recombinant integrin fragments encompassing repeats III to VII of αIIb (9.Gulino D. Boudignon C. Zhang L. Concord E. Rabiet M.-J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and IV to VII of α5 (10.Banères J.L. Roquet F. Green M. LeCalvez H. Parello J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24744-24753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have been shown to mimic the ligand-binding features (divalent cation and RGD dependence) that are observed with native integrin receptors, indicating that the divalent cation-binding domains in the α subunits are part of the ligand-recognition pocket of integrins. Repeats III and IV in the α subunits have also been shown to be involved in cell spreading and in assembly of focal contacts at the cell surface (11.Cao Z. Huang K. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31670-31679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The N-terminal regions of the integrin β subunits are characterized by a conserved domain that displays sequence homology with the I-domain found in several integrin α subunits (12.Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This I-type domain in the integrin β subunits includes the following: (i) a functional cation-binding site that displays strong similarities at the level of its metal-coordinating residues with the MIDAS site of the α subunit I-domains (13.Tozer E.C. Liddington R.C. Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21978-21984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 14.Lin E.C.K. Ratnokov B.I. Tsai P.M. Gonzalez E.R. McDonald S. Pelletier A.J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14236-14243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); (ii) a totally conserved DDL motif, close to the MIDAS-type site that is apparently involved in the recognition of RGD-containing ligands (15.Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar); (iii) possibly a specific sequence responsible for heterodimer formation; in the case of the human β3 I-type domain this specific sequence corresponds to the segment β3-(275–280) with the unique hexapeptide sequence, VGSDNH, that is responsible for species-restricted αβ heterodimer assembly (16.McKay B.S. Annis D.S. Honda S. Christie D. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30544-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As tentatively proposed by McKay et al. (16.McKay B.S. Annis D.S. Honda S. Christie D. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30544-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the sequences in the β subunits that are topologically related to the β3-(275–280) sequence are likely to participate in heterodimer assembly for the different integrins. Divalent cations play a central role in ligand recognition by the integrins (17.Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12927-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both α and β subunits are responsible for divalent-cation binding (2.Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. Mecham R.P. Integrins: Molecular and Biological Responses to Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 1-32Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the α subunit, the divalent cation-binding sites are located at the level of the EF-hand type sequences. By using isolated recombinant EF-hand domains from αIIb (9.Gulino D. Boudignon C. Zhang L. Concord E. Rabiet M.-J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and α5 (10.Banères J.L. Roquet F. Green M. LeCalvez H. Parello J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24744-24753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), a stoichiometric ratio of four cations bound per protein has been inferred, in agreement with the occurrence of four EF-hand-type sequences in both integrin α subunits (2.Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. Mecham R.P. Integrins: Molecular and Biological Responses to Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 1-32Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These four divalent cation-binding sites are distributed in two classes of sites (each class with two sites), differing by their affinities with the low affinity sites regulating ligand recognition (9.Gulino D. Boudignon C. Zhang L. Concord E. Rabiet M.-J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Banères J.L. Roquet F. Green M. LeCalvez H. Parello J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24744-24753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Divalent cation binding to the integrin β subunits is also intimately linked to integrin function. Apparently, a single cation-binding site occurs in the β subunits at the level of their MIDAS-type sequences (13.Tozer E.C. Liddington R.C. Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21978-21984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 14.Lin E.C.K. Ratnokov B.I. Tsai P.M. Gonzalez E.R. McDonald S. Pelletier A.J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14236-14243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Based on model studies, D'Souzaet al. (18.D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Cierniewski C. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) proposed that divalent cation binding to the β3 subunit promotes a ligand-competent conformation and that the initially protein-bound cation is released after formation of the ligand-receptor complex. This mechanism has not yet been fully assessed with a native receptor or with an isolated β I-type domain. Evaluation by equilibrium dialysis of the number of divalent cation-binding sites in an intact integrin receptor, αIIbβ3, amounts to a total of 4–5 (19.Rivas G.A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), in agreement with the aforementioned distribution of 4 sites in the α subunits and 1 site in the β subunits. So far the respective role of these divalent cation-binding sites, and their possible synergy, on ligand recognition by the integrins have not been fully elucidated. McKay et al. (16.McKay B.S. Annis D.S. Honda S. Christie D. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30544-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have reported a recombinant αβ heterodimer formed of both segments αIIb-(1–233) and β3-(111–318) that binds Arg-Gly-Asp-Trp (RGDW), as a peptide ligand, in the presence of Ca2+. Interestingly, this minimized αIIbβ3 integrin does not contain any of the αIIb EF-hand cation-binding sites; its α component is represented exclusively by repeats I to III. It is likely that this mini-integrin only contains part of the ligand recognition pocket in the absence of the ligand-competent EF-hand domain from its αIIb subunit. A model has been recently proposed (10.Banères J.L. Roquet F. Green M. LeCalvez H. Parello J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24744-24753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in which the RGD tripeptide sequence from the protein ligand acts as a dual motif with two oppositely charged groups, a negative one (the carboxylate from Asp) and a positive one (the guanidinium from Arg), that interact with distinct structural elements on each of both α and β subunits. Such a model would account for the binding of the RGDW tetrapeptide by the mini-integrin αIIbβ3, as reported by McKay et al. (16.McKay B.S. Annis D.S. Honda S. Christie D. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30544-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One possibility for retaining ligand-binding capacity in an RGD-dependent manner could be related to the fact that this αIIbβ3 mini-integrin includes the RGD-binding sequence DDL conserved in all integrin β subunit I-type domains (15.Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, the three N-terminal FG-GAP repeats, I to III, that are present in the α component of the αIIbβ3 mini-integrin could also contain ligand-binding sites unidentified so far. As emphasized by Weber (20.Weber G. Protein Interactions. Chapman & Hall, New York1992: 271-287Google Scholar), protein interactions need to viewed as the convergence of cooperative effects of many inputs rather than a sum of fixed independent influences. In this respect, the RGD adhesive sequence displays two complex charged groups, a guanidinium and a carboxylate (which will give rise to electrostatic as well as hydrogen bonding) and several hydrogen bond acceptors and donors from the tripeptide main chain that will elicit a variety of contacts with elements from the integrin receptor. These elements can be rather interspersed in the amino acid sequences from both α and β subunits. Since McKay et al.(16.McKay B.S. Annis D.S. Honda S. Christie D. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30544-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) expressed their mini-integrin directly as a heterodimeric assembly, a strict delineation of the ligand-binding properties of each subunit fragment, taken separately, as well as of their respective cation requirements, could not be achieved. To carry out such an analysis, we cloned and expressed inEscherichia coli two recombinant proteins from the α and β subunits of human integrin α5β1,i.e. α5-(160–448) and β1-(121–329). Both fragments form a stable and soluble αβ mini-heterodimer that is ligand-competent in an RGD- and cation-dependent manner. Based on previous results with a minimal EF-hand domain of α5 (10.Banères J.L. Roquet F. Green M. LeCalvez H. Parello J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24744-24753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we expressed here a novel α5 fragment as a more integrated structural unit with regard to its capacity of combining ligand and cation binding. In doing so, we were guided by previous results indicating that the FG-GAP repeat III in α5 converges toward the ligand-binding pocket of α5β1 (21.Mould A.P. Borrows L. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25664-25672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, the β subunit I-domain is likely to lie close to repeat III of the α subunits in native integrin receptors, indicating that repeat III participates to heterodimer stability (22.Loftus J.C. Liddington R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides the whole EF-hand domain (repeats IV through VII), for which cation-dependent ligand binding has been previously demonstrated (10.Banères J.L. Roquet F. Green M. LeCalvez H. Parello J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24744-24753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the α5 component of our minimized human integrin α5β1 also includes the totality of repeat III, whereas the β1 component of this mini-integrin corresponds to the totality of the I-type domain. We establish here through a detailed study of the binding to α5-(160–448) and β1-(121–329) of (i) divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+), (ii) RGD-containing ligands (fibronectin fragments and synthetic peptides), and (iii) simple compounds mimicking the RGD motif (n-butyrate and guanidinium chloride) that these isolated integrin fragments taken separately display cation-dependent ligand-binding properties that are closely related to those observed with the α5-(160–448)·β1-(121–329) mini-integrin assembly itself. Buffer A contained 12.5 mm sodium borate, 50 mm KCl at pH 8.3. Buffer B contained 20 mm potassium cacodylate, 50 mm KCl at pH 6.0. Buffer C contained 20 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2 at pH 6.0. The RGD-containing fibronectin ligands of human origin include the following recombinant proteins: 3Fn7–10 (residues 1150–1509; Ref. 23.Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) and 3Fn10–11 (residues 1423–1691; Ref. 24.Lombardo A. Wang Y. Ni C.-Z. Dai X. Dickinson C.D. Kondapani R.

The α5β1 integrin fragments from human origin used in this work are described below. The DNA sequence coding for residues 160–448 of human α5 was produced by PCR using the full-length α5 cDNA (25.Argraves W.S. Suzuki S. Arai H. Thompson K. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105 (1160): 1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) as a template. The following oligonucleotides were used as primers: 5′-GCA CGT CAT ATG GGC CAG ATC CTG TCT GCC-3′ and 5′-CG GGATCC TCA CCC CTC TAA GCT GCA GCT-3′. These primers were designed to generate an NdeI restriction site at the 5′ end, and an in-frame stop codon, as well as aBamHI restriction site, at the 3′ end. Amplification was performed in a Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler using Taqpolymerase (Perkin-Elmer) and proceeded through a cycle of denaturation at 94 °C (1 min), annealing at 55 °C (1 min), and extension at 72 °C (2 min), for a total of 30 cycles. The PCR fragment was purified using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), digested with NdeI and BamHI, and inserted into the pET15b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). This vector allows expression of the corresponding sequence fused with a HisTag N-terminal segment that includes the hexahistidinyl segment, as well as the thrombin cleavage site. The clone obtained was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (26.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Soc. U. S. A. 1977; 74 (5457): 5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). E. coli BLR(DE3) host strain (Novagen) was transformed with the pET15b-α5-(160–448) vector. The corresponding recombinant protein was purified from the insoluble fraction obtained after bacterial lysis, as described previously for α5-(229–448) (10.Banères J.L. Roquet F. Green M. LeCalvez H. Parello J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24744-24753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The His-tagged protein was digested with thrombin under conditions similar to those described for α5-(229–448) (10.Banères J.L. Roquet F. Green M. LeCalvez H. Parello J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24744-24753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to remove the oligohistidine N-terminal appendix. The protein obtained includes the extraneous N-terminal tetrapeptide GSHM resulting from thrombin cleavage. The DNA sequence coding for residues 121–329 of human β1 (25.Argraves W.S. Suzuki S. Arai H. Thompson K. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105 (1160): 1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) was produced by PCR using a human cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as a template. The following oligonucleotides were used as primers: 5′-GCA CGT CCA TGG TAT CCC ATT GAC CTC TAC CTT-3′ and 5′-CG GGA TCC CTA GGA AAG GGA ATT GTA TGC ATC AAT-3′. These primers were designed to generate an NcoI restriction site at the 5′ end and an in-frame stop codon, as well as a BamHI restriction site, at the 3′ end. Amplification was performed in a Biometra thermal cycler (Whatman) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and proceeded through a cycle of denaturation at 94 °C (45 s), annealing at 53 °C (45 s), and extension at 72 °C (2 min), for a total of 30 cycles. The PCR fragment was purified using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), digested with NcoI and BamHI, and inserted into the pET32a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). This vector allows expression of the corresponding sequence fused with thioredoxin (Trx) and a hexahistidinyl segment at the N terminus of the target protein. The clone obtained was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (26.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Soc. U. S. A. 1977; 74 (5457): 5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The E. coli AD494(DE3) host strain (Novagen) was transformed with both the pET32b-β1-(121–329) expression vector and a pET9a vector containing the GroESL-coding region. Cultures of the transformed strain were grown overnight at 30 °C in Terrific Broth medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin, diluted 1 in 100 into the same culture medium, and incubated with shaking at 30 °C to an absorbance of 0.8 at 600 nm. Induction of protein expression was achieved by addition of IPTG to a final 1 mm concentration and further incubation for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm KCl, 5 mmimidazole, 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 mm PMSF at pH 8, and lysed by sonication. The suspension was centrifuged (27,000 ×g for 30 min), and the supernatant was recovered. The DNA was precipitated with protamine sulfate (27.van der Westhuizen D.R. von Holt C. FEBS Lett. 1971; 14: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and the protein supernatant was dialyzed against 12.5 mm sodium borate, 150 mm KCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol, pH 8.3, and loaded onto a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen) previously equilibrated in the same buffer. TrxTag-β1-(121–329) was eluted with a linear imidazole gradient (0–200 mm). The protein was eluted at ∼150 mm imidazole. The Trx-tagged β1-(121–329) protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8 containing 150 mm NaCl and 2.5 mm CaCl2. Digestion was carried out at 21 °C at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 10 units of enterokinase (Sigma) per mg of cleavable protein. The reaction was stopped by the addition of PMSF to a final concentration of 2 mm. The time needed for an efficient cleavage was determined by a time course SDS-PAGE analysis (not shown). The digestion mixture was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 400 mm KCl, 2 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol at pH 8 and loaded onto a Ni-NTA column. The unbound protein was dialyzed against 12.5 mmsodium borate, 150 mm KCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, pH 8.3, and loaded onto a DEAE-Trisacryl column (IBF, France). Elution was carried out with a linear KCl gradient (0.15 to 1.5 m KCl). The protein obtained includes the extraneous N-terminal dipeptide AM resulting from the cleavage by enterokinase. Desalting was carried out on a Sephadex G-50 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A. The purified proteins were analyzed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry using a Fisons VG Trio2000 mass spectrometer equipped with an ion spray source. Molecular weights were determined using the electrospray ionization deconvolution software from Fisons. N-terminal amino sequencing was carried out by automated step-by-step Edman degradation using a gas phase amino acid sequencer with an on-line PTH analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc.), as described by Speicher (28.Speicher D.W. Hugli T.E. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. 1. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1989: 24Crossref Google Scholar). Ten steps were performed. UV absorbance measurements at 276 nm (Cary 118 UV spectrometer) were used to determine accurate protein concentrations of the stock solutions. The molar absorptivities of the different recombinant proteins used throughout this work were determined by the procedure of Gill and von Hippel (29.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Molar absorptivities (expressed in litersm−1·cm−1) at 276 nm are 28,600 and 21,350 for the fully Mg2+-loaded forms of α5-(160–448) and β1-(121–329), respectively. No real difference was observed between the Mg2+-loaded proteins and the corresponding apoforms with regard to their UV molar absorptivities at 276 nm (in contrast with the CD effects reported under “Results”). The molar UV absorptivities for the Fn ligands used in this work had been previously determined (10.Banères J.L. Roquet F. Green M. LeCalvez H. Parello J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24744-24753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In general, no aggregation effects were observed in the 300–390 nm region of the UV spectra for the different proteins used in this work (if any, this was usually discarded through ultracentrifugation). By adopting the borate buffer A, at pH 8.3, aggregation effects were negligible with the integrin apoforms, whereas this is not totally the case for α5-(160–448) at lower pH values. The apoforms of α5-(160–448) and β1-(121–329) were prepared by precipitation of the fully Mg2+-loaded forms using trichloroacetic acid 3% (v/v) as a precipitating agent, as described previously in the case of the EF-hand Ca2+/Mg2+-binding parvalbumin (30.Blancuzzi Y. Padilla A. Parello J. Cavé A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The precipitated protein was washed once in 3% trichloroacetic acid and twice with distilled water with no apparent loss of protein in the supernatant. Although the metal content in the apoforms was not directly measured, the CD experiments reported in this work show that these forms are practically metal-free. Metal-free distilled water was used (Ca2+ impurities estimated in the 2 μmrange by flame spectrophotometry). CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C with a dichrograph CD6 (Jobin Yvon, Paris, France). The spectra are the average of five scans recorded using a bandwidth of 2 nm, a step-width of 0.1 nm, and a 0.5 s averaging time per point. Cell path lengths (Hellma, France) were 1.00 ± 0.01 mm (far-UV region, wavelengths <250 nm) or 10.00 ± 0.01 mm (near-UV region, wavelengths >250 nm). Protein concentrations in the 10 μm range were used for all experiments. The UV absorption spectra (390 to 230 nm) of the protein samples were systematically recorded before the CD measurements and showed no contribution of aggregation effects (see under “Protein Concentrations”). All CD measurements were carried out in the borate buffer A at pH 8.3 which is optically transparent within all the wavelength range instrumentally accessible. Since pH values above 7–8 give rise to formation of hydroxides with Mn2+ solutions, the CD experiments using this divalent cation were carried out in cacodylate buffer B at pH 6.0. We verified using the Mg2+-loaded proteins in either buffer A or B that changing the pH did not affect the CD spectra. However, we preferentially used the borate buffer A in most CD experiments since (i) the apoform of α5-(160–448) was found to be more soluble at basic pH values than at lower pH values and (ii) in contrast to the cacodylate buffer B, the borate buffer A offered the possibility to carry out CD measurements at the lowest wavelength accessible in the 185–190 nm range. All CD experiments were carried out in duplicate (the observed variations between two independent experiments are illustrated in Fig. 2 C). Absolute ellipticity values were inferred from standardization with d10-camphorsulfonic acid (Fluka, Switzerland) according to the procedure of Venyaminov and Yang (31.Venyaminov S.Y. Yang J.T. Fasman G. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 69-108Crossref Google Scholar). Molar ellipticities are given in degree·cm2dmol−1 of mean amino acid residue (M r = 115). Deconvolution of the far-UV CD profiles was carried out using a standard computer procedure (32.Geourjeon P. Deléage M. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). The CD data used in the deconvolution included the far-UV range 190–250 nm (spectra in Fig. 1, A and C, only display data down to 195 nm). Although the signal-to-noise ratio in the 190–195 nm regi"

Photons are absorbed by pigments of the light harvesting chlorophyll-carotenoid-protein complexes that are associated with the membrane embedded photosynthetic reaction centers. Excitation energy can be transferred to the reaction centers where it induces charge separation across the membrane. This leads to a series of electron transfer reactions resulting in oxidation of water and the production of chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH, which are used for CO2 fixation. If the absorption of light exceeds the capacity of photosynthetic energy consumption, over-reduction of the electron transport carriers and increase of the lifetime of excited states in the light-harvesting-antennae occur. Over-reduction of the electron carriers can lead to photo-oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species. O2 can be directly reduced by PSI1 (1.Mehler A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1951; 33: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) generating superoxide anion radical (O⨪2) and other reactive oxygen species. Increase in the lifetime of excited singlet chlorophyll increases the probability of triplet chlorophyll formation, which can react with O2 to produce 1O2 (2.Asada K. Baker N.R. Bowyer J.R. From Molecular Mechanisms to the Field. BIOS Scientific Publishers, Oxford, UK1994: 129-142Google Scholar,3.Asada K. Baker N. Advances in Photosynthesis: Photosynthesis and the Environment. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1996: 123-150Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species cause photo-oxidative damage, especially to PSII, which is considered to be the primary target for photoinhibition (4.Barber J. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 5.Prasil O. Adir N. Ohad I. Barber J. The Photosystems: Structure, Function and Molecular Biology.

Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). Thus, mechanisms that balance energy input through photochemistry with energy consumption through CO2assimilation and other metabolic pathways are essential for plant survival. Mechanisms that balance energy input and consumption can be divided into short and long term responses. Short term responses include nonphotochemical dissipation of excess energy (7.Demming-Adams B. Gilmore A.M. Adams III, W.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 43: 599-626Crossref Scopus (2081) Google Scholar, 8.Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and reduction of energy transfer to PSII through state transition, a process that leads to a redistribution of excitation energy to PSI by a reorganization of the antennae (9.Bonaventura C. Myers J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 189: 366-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 10.Murata N. Biochim. Biophys.

In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii the absorbance cross-sections of the two photosystems are nearly balanced in state I and change to 0.15 for PSII and 0.85 for PSI in state II (11.Delosme R. Olive J. Wollman F.A. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1996; 1273: 150-158Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In algae long term responses may result in a reduction of the PSII antenna size (12.Ley A. Mauzerall D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 680: 95-106Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 13.Smith B.M. Morrissey P.J. Guenther J.E. Menson J.A. Harrison M.A. Allen J.F. Melis A.

Melis A. Planta. 1998; 205: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Alternatively, photoautotrophs could adapt by enhancing their electron-consuming sinks through a selective increase in the capacity of CO2 assimilation or photorespiration (17.Kozaki A. Takeba G. Nature. 1996; 384: 557-560Crossref Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In contrast, if electron consuming processes are diminished or blocked, the organisms become highly sensitive to light (18.Somerville C.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1986; 37: 467-507Crossref Google Scholar, 19.Spreitzer R.J. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 411-434Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This can also be observed in mutants of C.reinhardtii that have reduced amounts of PSI or that are deficient in PSI (20.Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 565-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the light sensitivity of mutants of C. reinhardtii deficient in PSII, the cytochromeb 6/f complex, or PSI has revealed that PSI-deficient mutants have the highest sensitivity, 2K. Redding and J. D. Rochaix, unpublished results. suggesting that among the photosynthetic electron transfer complexes PSI is the most important in providing protection against photo-oxidation. The PSI complex functions as a light-driven oxidoreductase that transfers electrons from plastocyanin or cytochromec 6 to ferredoxin. Whereas the reducing side of PSI is remarkably conserved between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, there are differences in the oxidizing side. One major difference concerns the PsaF subunit that is partly exposed to the lumenal space of the thylakoids. The PsaF-deficient mutant of C. reinhardtii, 3bF, is drastically impaired in electron transfer from both plastocyanin and cytochrome c 6 to PSI (21.Farah J. Rappaport F. Choquet Y. Joliot P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4976-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 22.Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, the specific deletion of the psaFgene in cyanobacteria does not affect photoautotrophic growth (23.Chitnis P.R. Purvis D. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20146-20151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thein vivo measured electron transfer rate between cytochromec 553 and PSI is the same as in the wild type (24.Xu Q. Xu L. Chitnis V. Chitnis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3205-3211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These differences can be explained by the presence of a N-terminal domain in the algal and plant-type PsaF that is responsible for binding of cytochrome c 6 or plastocyanin to PSI (25.Hippler M. Reichert J. Sutter M. Zak E. Altschmied L. Schröer U. Herrmann R.G. Haehnel W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6374-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 26.Hippler M. Drepper F Rochaix J.D. Muehlenhoff U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4180-4188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the PsaF subunit fromC. reinhardtii reveals that the eukaryotic protein has a specific recognition site for the binding of plastocyanin and cytochrome c 6 that is missing in the cyanobacterial protein. Lys16–23 of PsaF appear to play a crucial role in the electrostatic interaction with both electron donor proteins (27.Hippler M. Drepper F. Haehnel W. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7339-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the PsaF-deficient strain grows photoautotrophically with doubling times comparable with wild type at light intensities of 60 μE m−2 s−1 (20.Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 565-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that the PsaF-deficient strain and the PsaF-K23Q mutants are sensitive to high light (>400 μE m−2s−1) under aerobic conditions. In vitroexperiments indicate that the stability of isolated PSI complexes from wild type and PsaF mutants are comparable in high light. We have isolated a PsaF-deficient suppressor strain that is resistant to high light. This strain has a high Chl a/b ratio and is deficient in functional LHCI and II. Biochemical analysis of thylakoid membranes isolated from this strain indicates that the phenotype can be best explained by a defect in assembly of the proteins of the light-harvesting complex (LHCP). In vivo photoinhibition experiments and thermoluminescence measurements show that PSII function is impaired at high light intensities in the PsaF-deficient strain and in two independent K23Q transformants, but not in strains containing PsaF or in the PsaF suppressor strain. This indicates that under high light a functionally intact oxidizing side of PSI is essential for protection of C. reinhardtii from photo-oxidation when PSI is properly connected to the antennae. C. reinhardtii wild type and mutant strains were grown as described (28.Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar). Tris acetate phosphate medium (TAP) or high salt medium (HSM) were solidified with 2% Bacto agar (Difco) and supplemented with 75 μg/ml emetine (Sigma) when required. Procedures for the preparation of recombinant plasmids and DNA sequencing were performed as described (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α was used as bacterial host. Nuclear transformation of the C. reinhardtii light-resistant PsaF-deficient suppressor was performed according to Ref. 27.Hippler M. Drepper F. Haehnel W. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7339-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar. Cells were co-transformed with 2 μg of DNA of the p2.9F1 plasmid, containing the PsaF gene and 1 μg of DNA of the cry1–1 plasmid (30.Nelson J.E. Savereide P.B. Lefebvre P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4011-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). After transformation the cells were diluted into 10 ml of TAP-N medium lacking ammonium chloride and incubated under low light (5 μE m−2 s−1) for 3 days. The cells were then concentrated by centrifugation at 2500 × g, resuspended in 0.5 ml of TAP-N, and plated on TAP plates supplemented with 75 μg/ml emetine. The plates were incubated under low light (5 μE m−2 s−1) until colonies appeared. Growing colonies were restreaked on fresh TAP/emetine plates and characterized. The isolation of plastocyanin followed published procedures (31.Merchant S. Bogorad L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) with modifications as described in Ref. 22.Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar. The concentrations of plastocyanin was determined spectroscopically using an extinction coefficient of 4.9 mm−1 cm−1 at 597 nm for the oxidized form of plastocyanin (32.Katoh S. Shiratori I. Takamiya A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1962; 51: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Doubling times of the mutants were determined from four independent measurements. Growth tests were initiated by spotting 15 μl of log phase cultures onto agar plates. Anaerobiosis of agar plates was established using the BioMérieux (Marcy-l'Etoile, France) Generbag Anaerobiosis system according to the manufacturer's instructions. The isolation of thylakoid membranes purified by centrifugation through a sucrose step gradient and the isolation of PSI particles were as described (22.Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32.Katoh S. Shiratori I. Takamiya A. J. Biochem.

Chl concentrations were determined according to Ref. 34.Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar. Protein determination in solution was done by the bicinchoninic acid method (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After electrophoretic fractionation by SDS-PAGE (15.5% T, 2.66% C) according to Ref. 35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar the proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and incubated with antibodies as described (36.Hippler M. Ratajczak R. Haehnel W. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 280-284Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Immuno-detection was carried out according to Ref. 22.Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar. For N-terminal amino acid sequencing proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (36.Hippler M. Ratajczak R. Haehnel W. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 280-284Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thylakoids were solubilized with a 10:1 (w/w) ratio of dodecyl maltoside/chlorophyll prior to electrophoresis. Deriphat-PAGE (7.5% T) was performed according to Ref. 37.Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. For determination of F mand F m′, samples were subjected to saturating light pulses of 0.7 s at 1-min intervals and illuminated continuously with a nonactinic modulated light using a Hansatech fluorimeter. q P was calculated from the fluorescence data as (F m′ −F)/(F m′) (38.Schreiber U Photosyn. Res. 1986; 9: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). For this experiment cells were grown in minimal medium and were used for the experiment when they had reached a cell density of ∼2 × 106cells/ml. Oxygen evolution was measured with a Clark electrode (Hansatech). For illumination of the sample, the sample housing was connected through fiber optics with a halogen lamp (Hansatech). Light intensities could be adjusted through a set of neutral filters with different transmission values. Gross oxygen evolution and oxygen uptake was measured at 25 °C using a system described previously (39.Sültemeyer D. Biehler K. Fock H.P. Planta. 1993; 189: 235-242Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Actinic light was provided by a slide projector (Braun) with heat filter. The light intensity was adjusted using neutral density filters. The rates of oxygen evolution and uptake were calculated according to Ref. 39.Sültemeyer D. Biehler K. Fock H.P. Planta. 1993; 189: 235-242Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar. Thermoluminescence (TL) was measured as described previously (40.Demeter S. Vass I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 764: 24-32Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). TL was charged by giving a single turnover flash at −5 °C followed by rapid freezing to −20 °C. The TL signal was then recorded during warming to 70 °C with a heating rate of 20 °C/min. If samples were subjected to photoinhibitory treatment, the samples were dark adapted at 20 °C for 2 min before starting the TL measurements. No cryoprotectants were added for the TL measurements. Flash-induced spectroscopy was carried out using a single beam spectrophotometer (Occam Technology). The measuring light, provided by a quartz halogen lamp was filtered through a 817 nm (5 nm full width at half-maximum) interference filter and passed through a cuvette containing 500 μl of the sample with an optical path length of 1 cm. The signal from the detecting photodiode (1 cm2) was amplified with an electrical bandwidth ranging from direct current to 60 MHz. Signals were recorded with a Tektronic Oscilloscope THS 710 (2500 channels) and transferred to a computer interface analog signal capture board (8 bit, 100 MHz). Flash excitation was provided by a xenon flash (2 μs full width at half-maximum). 16 individual signals were averaged for each trace at a repetition rate of 0.2 Hz. To determine whether the PsaF-deficient mutant grows under high light, growth tests were performed on TAP and HSM at light intensities of 60 and 400 μE m−2 s−1 under aerobic or anaerobic conditions (Fig. 1). Two different PsaF-deficient strains were used, the 3bF strain (21.Farah J. Rappaport F. Choquet Y. Joliot P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4976-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and one of its progeny, 6a+, derived from a back-cross of 3bF to wild type. Immunoblot analysis using PsaF- and PsaD-specific antibodies revealed that these strains do not express PsaF but have normal levels of PsaD, another subunit of PSI (Fig. 1). As control strains, we used a rescued 3bF strain (RPsaF), that was selected on emetine-containing plates after co-transformation with two plasmids containing the nuclear PsaF gene and the Cry1 gene (which confers cryptopleurine and emetine resistance; Ref. 30.Nelson J.E. Savereide P.B. Lefebvre P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4011-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), respectively, and two strains with mutations in the N-terminal domain of PsaF, K23Q and K30Q (27.Hippler M. Drepper F. Haehnel W. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7339-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These strains express between 50 and 100% of PsaF compared with the wild type as determined by immunoblotting with PsaF-specific antibodies (Fig.1). The control and the PsaF-deficient strains 3bF and 6a+ grow on minimal medium at a light intensity of 60 μE m−2s−1. At a higher light intensity of 400 μE m−2 s−1, both strains 3bF and 6a+die on HSM in the presence or absence of copper, whereas the control strains survive. Copper deficiency is known to lead to replacement of plastocyanin by cytochrome c 6 in C. reinhardtii (31.Merchant S. Bogorad L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Growth of the K23Q mutant, which is strongly impaired in electron transfer between plastocyanin and PSI, on HSM under high light is slower in the presence than in the absence of copper. This observation could be explained by the fact that cytochromec 6 is a more efficient electron donor to the mutated PSI complex than plastocyanin (27.Hippler M. Drepper F. Haehnel W. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7339-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The PsaF-deficent strains 3bF and 6a+ are resistant to a light intensity of 400 μE m−2 s−1 when grown on TAP under aerobic or on minimal medium under anaerobic conditions. To screen for high light-resistant suppressors of 3bF, cells were plated on HSM and illuminated with continuous light of 400 μE m−2 s−1. Out of 3 × 107cells plated, 1–5 colonies were obtained. When this experiment was repeated with a higher light intensity (1000 μE m−2s−1), no suppressor strains were recovered. Among the isolated high light-resistant mutants, 19 out of 20 had a high Chl a/b ratio (>10). One of these suppressors was analyzed more thoroughly (see below). As shown in Fig. 1 this suppressor strain (Sup PsaF), as well as one of its progeny, 2B, derived from a back-cross with 6a+, survives under conditions where the PsaF-deficient strains 3bF and 6a+ die. The same was obtained when a PsaF- and Chl b-deficient strain, 2A, derived from a cross between strain CC1355 (cbn1-deficient) and 6a+, was tested on minimal medium in high light. The immunoblot in Fig. 1 verifies that the strains SupPsaF, 2B, and 2A are deficient in PsaF. These results indicate that high light tolerance in PsaF-deficient strains correlates with a deficiency in Chl b. To determine whether the phenotype of light resistance is due to a chloroplast or nuclear mutation and cosegregates with a high Chl a/b ratio, the suppressor strain Sup PsaF was crossed with the PsaF-deficient strain 6a+. The Chl a/b ratio and light sensitivity of the resulting progeny was determined. As shown in TableI, the segregation of progeny with a low and high Chl a/b ratio is close to 1:1. None of the PsaF-deficient progeny with a low Chl a/b ratio survived light intensities above 400 μE m−2 s−1, whereas most of the progeny with a high Chl a/b ratio did. This suggests that the suppressor mutation is nuclear encoded. To confirm these results, we performed an additional cross between one of the progeny, 15B−, resistant to a light intensity of 1000 μE m−2s−1, and 6a+. Again, all progeny with a low Chl a/b ratio died in high light. In contrast, nearly all of the progeny with a high Chl a/b ratio survived the light stress. This indicates that the high Chl a/b ratio phenotype cosegregates with the suppression of the light sensitivity and that the differences in light sensitivity are most likely due to differences in the genetic background. The suppressor strains revert with a frequency of nearly 80% when kept under low light. Revertants have a low Chl a/b ratio, comparable with 3bF.Table IGenetic characterization of the 3bF suppressor strainPercentage of surviving progeny at the light intensity indicatedμE m−2 s −1μE m−2 s −1μE m−2 s −16a+ × SupPsaF−604001000Chl a/b ≈ 21510000Chl a/b ≥ 81810083666a+ × 15B−Chl a/b ≃ 2710000Chl a/b ≥ 8710010086The first cross was between the suppressor strain SupPsaF− and the PsaF-deficient strain 6a+.

Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 clearly shows that after fractionation of isolated thylakoid membranes with such a system, a prominent green band, LHCII, present in the 3bF control and in a revertant with a low Chl a/b ratio, is missing in the suppressor strain. In addition, a new Chl-containing band is present in this strain that migrates slightly slower than the free Chl band (indicated by FC in Fig. 2). Analysis of this new band revealed that it contains two polypeptides with molecular masses of 25 and 30 kDa that react with LHCP II-specific antibodies (data not shown). The same polypeptides were detected when the higher molecular mass band (LHCII in Fig. 2) present in the 3bF thylakoids was analyzed. N-terminal amino acid sequencing indicated that the larger polypeptide corresponds to LHCP II type I of C. reinhardtii(51.Imbault P. Wittemer C. Johanningmeier U. Jacobs J.D. Howell S.H. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and that the smaller one contains the N-terminal sequence IEXYGPDRPKFLGPFR. Comparison with other LHCP II sequences shows that it corresponds to a LHCP II type II protein (52.Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), which has not yet been identified in C. reinhardtii. Because LHCP II type I and II are known to form the LHCPII-trimer (52.Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), this suggests that the green band missing in the suppressor strain and present in 3bF and the revertant is a LHCPII-trimer. LHCP that are normally integrated into thylakoid membranes are largely insensitive to protease digestion (53.Cline K. J. Biol.

It has been shown that LHCP with alterations in their amino acid sequence that are able to associate with thylakoids are not necessarily properly integrated into the membrane based on their protease sensitivity (54.Huang L. Adams Z. Hoffman N.E. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 56.Auchincloss A.H. Alexander A. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol.

To test the association and integration of LHCP with thylakoids isolated from the suppressor strain, its revertant and 3bF, tryptic digestions of isolated membranes were performed. Membranes prior to and after digestion were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. The blot shown in Fig. 3 was probed with a mixture of anti-LHCI antibodies directed against polypeptides 15, 15.1, 17.2, 18.1, and 22.1, which have also been shown to cross-react with the major LHCPII as well as with the CP24, 26, and 29 proteins from C. reinhardtii (58.Bassi R. Soen S.Y. Frank G. Zuber H. Rochaix J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25714-25721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis reveals that the majority of the LHCP detected in 3bF and the revertant can be isolated from thylakoids of the suppressor strain. Immunoblot analysis with single LHCI antibodies indicates that the LHCI subunit 17.2 is present at reduced levels in the thylakoid membranes from the suppres"

The free energy to drive this is provided by agonist binding, which has higher affinity to the active than to the inactive conformation. We have sought specific interhelical constraint contacts, using the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor as a model. Histidine substitutions of particular groups of amino acids, in transmembrane domains 3, 6, and 7, created high-affinity Zn2+ binding sites, demonstrating the close proximity of their side chains in the inactive state. Alanine point substitutions have shown the effect of weakening the individual intramolecular contacts. In each case, the acetylcholine affinity was increased, implying promotion of the activated state. These amino acids are highly conserved throughout the 7-TM receptor superfamily. We propose that they form an important part of a network of conserved interhelical contacts that defines the off-state of a general transmembrane switch mechanism.

Recently, we identified a patch of amino acids in TM 3 of the M1 mAChR, including the highly conserved residues Leu116 and Ser120, whose mutation increased ACh affinity and caused constitutive activation (3.Hulme E.C. Lu Z.-L. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 4.Lu Z.-L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol.

Although the high-resolution structures of the 7-TM receptors are unknown, a general model of the α-carbon backbone has been published, based on sequence analysis in the context of a low-resolution electron crystallographic structure of rhodopsin (5.Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 6.Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Unger V.M. J. Mol.

Interactions between highly conserved amino acids within the receptor core were proposed to mediate receptor conformational changes. In reference to the model, potential contacts for Leu116 are Phe374 (TM 6), Asn414 (TM 7), and Tyr418 (TM 7), while Ser120 may contact Tyr208 (TM 5). Mutations of Phe374 cause constitutive activation of the M5mAChR (7.Spalding T.A. Burstein E.S. Henderson S.C. Ducote K.R. Brann M.R. J. Biol.

Binding studies were conducted in 20 mm Na-Hepes buffer plus 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, for 2 h at 30 °C. (−)-N-[3H]methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) binding curves were fitted to a one-site model to yield a total concentration of binding sites,Rt (expressed relative to a wild-type control in each transfection) and an affinity constant,K NMS. Expression of the wild-type M1mAChR varied from 0.7 to 1.2 pmol/mg of protein in different transfections. The affinity of [3H]NMS for the wild-type receptor was 1.0 ± 0.05 × 1010m−1. Inhibition curves for ACh and ZnCl2 were fitted to the Hill equation, and the binding constants, K ACh and K Zn, were corrected for the Cheng-Prusoff shift, as necessary (4.Lu Z.-L. Hulme E.C. J.

With one exception (N414H-Y418H), the single, double, and triple His mutants were expressed at between 30 and 170% of the wild-type level in COS-7 cells, assayed by the specific binding of a high-affinity antagonist [3H]NMS (Table I). Most of the mutations caused less than a 3-fold change in [3H]NMS affinity. However, the F374H mutation caused a 7-fold reduction, which was partly reversed by the addition of a second His at position 116 or 414. The N414H-Y418H mutant gave 1% of wild-type expression, whereas its affinity was reduced by more than 10-fold. Both of these effects were substantially reversed by the incorporation of a third His at position 116 or 374.Table ILigand binding and functional activity of His-substituted M1 mAChRs[3H]NMS bindingACh bindingPI response to AChR tK NMSK AChpEC50E max% wild-typelog m −1logm −1log m −1% wild-typeWild-type(100)10.02 ± 0.045.04 ± 0.047.00 ± 0.03(100)L116H38 ± 810.28 ± 0.044.59 ± 0.055.98 ± 0.1090 ± 3F374H72 ± 79.14 ± 0.053.80 ± 0.045.16 ± 0.04101 ± 5N414H172 ± 210.23 ± 0.055.60 ± 0.010Y418H69 ± 510.44 ± 0.056.22 ± 0.086.63 ± 0.0853 ± 3S120H59 ± 59.95 ± 0.115.20 ± 0.015.64 ± 0.1451 ± 3Y208H91 ± 410.00 ± 0.054.53 ± 0.015.76 ± 0.1784 ± 3L116H-S120H39 ± 410.28 ± 0.154.58 ± 0.080L116H-Y208H38 ± 310.36 ± 0.074.58 ± 0.025.12 ± 0.0145 ± 6L116H-F374H52 ± 99.77 ± 0.014.04 ± 0.044.71 ± 0.0766 ± 5L116H-N414H56 ± 1510.06 ± 0.055.07 ± 0.080L116H-Y418H42 ± 410.52 ± 0.124.88 ± 0.015.36 ± 0.0831 ± 4S120H-Y208H72 ± 610.04 ± 0.034.98 ± 0.055.16 ± 0.0161 ± 3S120H-F374H71 ± 89.18 ± 0.064.12 ± 0.144.89 ± 0.1316 ± 3S120H-N414H85 ± 910.05 ± 0.085.88 ± 0.160S120H-Y418H53 ± 610.41 ± 0.016.07 ± 0.040F374H-N414H91 ± 99.78 ± 0.014.93 ± 0.180F374H-Y418H72 ± 119.43 ± 0.014.61 ± 0.044.54 ± 0.2118 ± 2L116H-S120H-Y208H37 ± 410.35 ± 0.074.62 ± 0.010L116H-S120H-F374H31 ± 59.85 ± 0.044.12 ± 0.130L116H-S120H-N414H38 ± 39.97 ± 0.074.98 ± 0.100L116H-S120H-Y418H30 ± 410.48 ± 0.055.26 ± 0.100L116H-F374H-N414H36 ± 59.44 ± 0.024.42 ± 0.040L116H-F734H-Y418H38 ± 29.83 ± 0.134.19 ± 0.044.65 ± 0.0713 ± 2N414H-Y418H1 ± 0.05<9.00NDaNon-detectable.0N414H-Y418H-L116H38 ± 79.89 ± 0.045.67 ± 0.030N414H-Y418H-F374H57 ± 49.38 ± 0.045.64 ± 0.040Ligand binding and PI assay were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Total concentration of receptor binding sites (R t) and the maximum PI response (E max) were expressed relative to a wild-type control in each transfection.

The mutation of F374H reduced ACh affinity by 17-fold (Table I), whereas mutation of Asn414 and Tyr418 to His (Table I) increased it by between 4- and 15-fold. The ACh affinities of the double and triple mutants were similar to the geometric means of the constituent single mutants.

Decreases were found for Y208H (4-fold), S120H (25-fold), and Y418H (35-fold), whereas the N414H mutant had, essentially, zero efficacy. These reductions mirror the decreased maximum PI responses for these mutants. The L116H-F374H, L116H-Y418H, F374H-Y418H, and L116H-F374H-Y418H mutants gave detectable PI responses to ACh, but multiple mutants in which Asn414 was altered were inactive (Table I). None of the His mutants showed raised basal PI signaling. The binding and functional data (Table I) suggested that, with the exception of N414H-Y418H, the His mutations caused only minor perturbations of the ground-state structure of the M1mAChR. Thus, probing the substituted structures with Zn2+ions, and determination of the chelate effect, should give information about the spatial proximities of the parent residues. Zn2+ binding was assayed by inhibition of the binding of [3H]NMS (2 × K dconcentration). The apparent K d of Zn2+for the wild-type receptor was 0.72 mm.

However, the mutation of Leu116increased the affinity by 14-fold. The double histidine mutant L116H-S120H, with a favorable iand i + 4 helical spacing, displayed a 43-fold increase in Zn2+ affinity (Fig. 2 a). The contribution to the free energy arising from cooperativity of the two histidines, calculated from the chelate effect (ΔΔG ochelate), was 2.6 kJ/mol (legend to Fig. 3). L116H-F374H and L116H-N414H yielded 71- and 32-fold increases in affinity, respectively, also giving positive chelate effects. However, L116H-Y208H, L116H-Y418H, as well as the combinations of S120H with Y208H, F374H, N414H, and Y418H did not show increased Zn2+ affinity relative to the single mutants and gave no chelate effect. The double mutations F374H-N414H and F374H-Y418H increased the affinity of Zn2+ by 8–14-fold (Fig.3 a). The triple histidine mutant generated by the addition of a third His at position 374 to L116H-S120H gave a further increase in Zn2+affinity of 5.7-fold, to 245-fold the wild-type value (ΔΔG ochelate = 6.3 kJ/mol) (Fig.2 a). In contrast, adding a third His at positions 208, 414, or 418 had little or no further effect. Combining L116H-F374H with N414H gave a 7-fold additional increase, to 504-fold the wild-type value (ΔΔG ochelate = 7.9 kJ/mol). Although it was impossible to measure the Zn2+affinity of the poorly expressed double mutant N414H-Y418H, the triple mutant F374H-N414H-Y418H showed a 75-fold increase relative to the wild-type receptor. This was 6- and 16-fold greater than the F374H-N414H or F374H-Y418H mutants, corresponding to a ΔΔG ochelate of 5.0 kJ/mol (Fig.3, a and b). An interaction between these residues is also supported by the rescue of receptor expression and affinity in the triple mutant relative to the N414H-Y418H mutant (TableI). Zn2+ inhibition of binding of the tertiary antagonist [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate was also tested for selected mutants, giving results similar to those measured by [3H]NMS. 2Z.-L. Lu, unpublished observations. Increasing the concentration of [3H]NMS from 2K d to 6 K d or 18K d shifted the inhibition curves to higher concentrations of Zn2+(Fig. 2 b) but did not reduce the maximum inhibition, thus showing high negative cooperativity of inhibition. None of these mutants increased the affinity of Ni2+ more than 8-fold.2 The inhibition of [3H]NMS binding to the histidine mutants by Zn2+ at the IC50 concentration was reversed by subsequent addition of 1 mm excess of EDTA to chelate the Zn2+ ions. This had less effect on the nonspecific binding of Zn2+ to the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2 c). These results indicated that relatively specific Zn2+binding sites were created and that the Zn2+ binding to the specific sites was reversible. Zn2+(100–300 μm) inhibited the PI response evoked by ACh at the L116H-F374H mutant (70% inhibition of the effect of 10−4m ACh at 300 μmZn2+) while having little effect on the wild-type receptor (20% inhibition of the effect of 10−5m ACh at 300 μm Zn2+) or the F374H and L116H mutants (less than 20% inhibition of the effect of 10−4m ACh at 300 μm Zn2+). However, Zn2+(10–100 μm) also doubled the basal PI signal in untransfected COS-7 cells, indistinguishably from cells transfected with the inactive L116H-N414H, F374H-N414H, and L116H-F374H-N414H mutants. The occurrence of this background of nonspecific stimulation made it impossible to quantitate the effects of Zn2+ on the ACh-induced PI response, and these experiments were not pursued further. Three of the triple His mutants showed strong positive cooperativity of Zn2+ binding by histidine (Fig.3 b), corresponding to a ΔΔG ochelate in the range of 5.0–7.9 kJ/mol. The K d values for Zn2+of these triads (L116H-S120H-F374H, 2.9 μm; L116H-F374H-N414H, 1.4 μm; F374H-N414H-Y418H, 9.5 μm) are comparable with those reported for triple-His mutants in the NK-1 (18.Elling C.E. Nielsen S.M. Schwartz T.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and κ-opioid receptors (19.Thirstrup K. Elling C.E. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7875-7878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and suggest the successful creation of high-affinity Zn2+ binding sites. The Hill coefficients of Zn2+ inhibition of [3H]NMS binding to these triple mutants were close to 1.0, consistent with the ligation of a single Zn2+ ion. The inhibition mechanism appeared near competitive, over the concentration ranges studied. It is likely that the introduction of a positively charged Zn2+ ion into the central cleft of the receptor strongly disfavors the binding of the positively charged radiolabeled antagonist, even though the altered residues do not overlap with the primary ligand binding residues (Fig. 1 a). The α-carbons of the residues composing the high-affinity triads must be separated by less than 13 Å to allow the corresponding imidazole side chains to coordinate a metal ion (20.Higaki F.N. Flettterick R.J. Craik C.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 100-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The results suggest that, in the inactive state of the M1 mAChR, a network of interactions exists between amino acid side chains, centered on Leu116 (TM 3)-Phe374 (TM 6)-Asn414(TM 7) and supported by Ser120 (TM 3) and Tyr418 (TM 7), which turn away from Leu116 and Asn414 by 40 degrees of arc (Fig.4). In contrast, it seems unlikely that Tyr208 (TM 5) is close enough to Ser120 (TM 3) to form a hydrogen bond; in the TSH receptor, the homologous tyrosine has been proposed to make a hydrogen bond with a carbonyl oxygen in the peptide backbone of TM6 (21.Biebermann H. Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Krause G. Grüters A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1461-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Ala substitution mutagenesis has suggested functions for some of the side chains of the amino acids in this network in activation of the M1 mAChR. Ala-substitutions of Leu116 and Ser120 simultaneously increased ACh affinity, raised basal activity, and enhanced signaling efficacy, suggesting that the intramolecular contacts made by these highly conserved residues help to stabilize the inactive ground state of the M1 mAChR (3.Hulme E.C. Lu Z.-L. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 4.Lu Z.-L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol.

Mutation of Ser120 to histidine caused little change in agonist and antagonist binding. In contrast with mutation of S120A and S120C,2 S120H strongly reduced signaling efficacy and maximum PI response. Double mutation of L116H-S120H and S120H-Y418H was inactive, but S120H-Y208H and S120H-F374H gave detectable PI response to ACh (Table I). Substitution of the small side chain of Ser120 by histidine may affect transition from the inactive to the active state, in which relative rotation and translation of helices are necessary, but without perturbation of the ground-state structure. His substitution of the TM 7 residues Asn414 and Tyr418 (Table I) increased ACh affinity but essentially abolished Gq-mediated phosphoinositide signaling. These findings were confirmed by Ala-substitution. In the case of N414A, as reported for L116A, there was also a large reduction in receptor expression. 3Z.-L. Lu and E. C. Hulme, manuscript in preparation. Asn414 and Tyr418 may resemble Leu116, Ser120, and Phe374 in making intramolecular contacts that stabilize the inactive ground state of the receptor. However, the loss of signal implies that they are also important for the formation of the agonist-receptor-Gqprotein signaling complex. Thus, in contrast to residues which act as pure constraints, they may have an additional role. In summary, several of the specific, conserved, interhelical contacts between TM 3, 6, and 7 of the rhodopsin-like 7-TM receptors which have been proposed from mutagenesis and modeling studies have been directly supported by the engineering of Zn2+ binding sites in the M1 mAChR. These contacts may be important in stabilizing the off-state of the receptor switch mechanism and be broken or rearranged during receptor activation."

This result prompted us to further investigate the mechanisms of recruitment of SOS, as well as Vav, to GTPase-containing signaling complexes in the plasma membrane of T cells. SOS and Vav activation and their membrane targeting may be controlled by the adaptor protein Grb-2, which binds to SOS and Vav (13.Buday L. Egan S.E. Rodriguez Viciana P. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1665-1669PubMed Google Scholar). These Grb-2/SOS and Grb-2/Vav interactions involve the association of the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of Grb-2 with proline-rich regions of SOS and Vav (13.Buday L. Egan S.E. Rodriguez Viciana P.

Considerably less is known about phosphoproteins that form docking sites for adaptor proteins, such as Grb-2, and mediate the recruitment of “SOS(Vav)·adaptor protein” complexes to the plasma membrane in an activated T cell.

Conceivably, Lck- and ZAP-70-dependent phosphorylation of LAT may play a critical role in the assembly of LAT·Grb-2-containing GEM-associated signaling complexes proximal to TCRζ and downstream effectors, such as GEM-associated Ras and Rho/Rac. In this study, we analyzed the roles of ZAP-70 and LAT in the recruitment of SOS, Vav, and Grb-2 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane- and GEM-associated signaling complexes in activated T cells. We demonstrate that TCRζ-associated ZAP-70 and TCRζ ITAMs are essential for the membrane recruitment of SOS and Vav. ZAP-70 initiates the membrane translocation of SOS and Vav by promoting the assembly of signaling complexes comprising ZAP-70, Grb-2, SOS, and Vav. This process precedes and is independent of the ZAP-70-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT. LAT amplifies this multistep recruitment process and is essential for the TCR-induced GEM targeting of SOS and Vav, which subsequently enables SOS and Vav to activate Ras and Rac.

The pSX vector expressing either wild-type (ZAP-70:WT) or Y493F-mutated ZAP-70 (37.Wange R.L. Guitian R. Isakov N. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Samelson L.E. J. Biol.

Lck-negative JCaM1.6 and parental E6.1 Jurkat human leukemic T cell lines (38.Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The P116 ZAP-70-deficient cell line, a variant of the Jurkat E6.1 T cell line (39.Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. R. T. Abraham (Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). The mutant Jurkat T cell line, J.CaM2, which is defective in pp36–38/LAT expression (27.Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), was generously supplied by Dr. A. Weiss. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies Inc., Burlington, Canada) medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma). The level of TCR surface expression is very similar in all of the Jurkat T cell lines and stable transfectants studied (data not shown). Transient transfection of ZAP-70-deficient P116 cells was performed essentially as described (25.Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Briefly, P116 cells (107) were electroporated with 20 μg of pSX:ZAP-70:WT or pSX:ZAP-70:Y493F in 0.4 ml of RPMI 1640 using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. Cells were used 36 h after transfection. For stable transfection of LAT-deficient J.CaM2 cells, 2 × 106 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pCEFL:LAT:C26A/C29A plasmid DNA or co-transfected with 1.5 μg of pEF/BOS:LAT:Y171F/Y191F or pEF/BOS:LAT:WT and 15 μg of pcDNA3 using DMRIE-C lipid reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 2 mg/ml of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mouse spleen T cells were purified using murine T cell enrichment columns (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (purity ≥95%). If not otherwise indicated, mouse T cells were stimulated (3 min, 37 °C) with 1 μg/107cells of the biotin-conjugated anti-TCR or anti-CD3ε mAb either alone or together with the biotin-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb. Cross-linking of mAbs was accomplished using streptavidin (Sigma) at a 4:1 (w/w) ratio for the indicated times. The anti-human CD3ε mAb was cross-linked using AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragments of a donkey anti-mouse IgG Ab (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Herbimycin A treatment of Jurkat T cells was performed for 3 h in complete RPMI plus 10% fetal bovine serum medium supplemented with 5 μmherbimycin A (Biomol). Cells were lysed in ice-cold 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA lysis buffer containing either 1% Triton X-100 plus 0.2% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40) or 60 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma) supplemented with a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (22.Salojin K. Zhang J. Cameron M. Gill B. Arreaza G. Ochi A. Delovitch T.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed by sonication in ice-cold 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA hypotonic buffer containing the above described mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (buffer A) (34.Nel A.E. Gupta S. Lee L. Ledbetter J.A. Kanner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18428-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Lysates were centrifuged to remove nuclei and debris, and particulate membrane-containing and soluble cytoplasm-containing fractions were separated by differential centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g. Membrane fractions were washed with ice-cold buffer A, solubilized by sonication in buffer A supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and either 1% Triton X-100 plus 0.2% Nonidet P-40 or 1% Nonidet P-40, and recentrifuged. Analysis of proteins in membrane fractions was performed after normalization for protein concentration levels. If not otherwise indicated, precleared postnuclear cell lysates were normalized for protein concentration levels and immunoprecipitated (3 h, 4 °C) with the specific polyclonal Abs or control isotype-matched preimmune Ig precoupled to 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfe, Canada). This was followed by four washes of the precipitates with ice-cold lysis buffer. When membrane proteins were precipitated, the amount of an Ab used was empirically determined to quantitatively precipitate the amount of antigen available. In vitro binding assays were performed after cell disruption in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 plus 1% SDS. Cell lysates were boiled for 2 min, diluted 20-fold with lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and incubated with the fusion proteins immobilized on agarose beads. Precipitated proteins were solubilized in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE (8–16% gradient gel, Novex, San Diego, CA) under reducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and immunoblotted with the indicated Abs (22.Salojin K. Zhang J. Cameron M. Gill B. Arreaza G. Ochi A. Delovitch T.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Signal intensities were quantified using a Molecular Imager System and Molecular Analyst imaging software (Bio-Rad). T cells (107) were cultured for 4 h in phosphate-free RPMI medium containing dialyzed 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (0.2 mCi/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C in phosphate-free RPMI/HEPES (2 mm). Precleared postnuclear lysates were immunoprecipitated by protein G-agarose precoupled to anti-Ras (10 μg) mAb, and 32P-labeled guanine nucleotides bound to Ras were fractionated using polyethyleneimine thin layer chromatography plates (J. T. Baker Inc.) as described (19.Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). T cells were incubated for 3–4 h at 37 °C in fetal bovine serum-free RPMI 1640 medium before stimulation to reduce background kinase activities to workable levels. Proteins immunoprecipitated from precleared postnuclear lysates were assayed for associated in vitro kinase activity after washing the beads in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mmMnCl2) by incubation (30 min, 30 °C) with [γ-32P]ATP (15 μCi; NEN Life Science Products) in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 3 μg of myelin basic protein (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) as substrate. Reactions were stopped by boiling with gel sample buffer. Myelin basic protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and its phosphorylation was visualized using a phosphor imager (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting showed that equal amounts of the ERK-1 and PAK proteins were precipitated before and after stimulation of all Jurkat T cell variants. Purification of the GEM fraction was performed as described (26.Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed by brief sonication in ice-cold 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and supplemented with a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (22.Salojin K. Zhang J. Cameron M. Gill B. Arreaza G. Ochi A. Delovitch T.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose made in lysis buffer and were overlaid with 2 ml of 30% sucrose and 1 ml of 5% sucrose. GEM-enriched fractions were collected from the 5%/30% interface following an overnight ultracentrifugation at 200,000 ×g. The relative purity of these fractions was monitored by the absence of CD45 in these fractions and its presence in the Triton X-100-soluble membrane fractions. We investigated how SOS and Vav are recruited to the plasma membrane. Initially, we identified those proteins that interact with SOS, Vav, and Grb2 after TCR ligation in Jurkat T cells. As reported (13.Buday L. Egan S.E. Rodriguez Viciana P. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Sieh M. Batzer A. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4435-4442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18428-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), TCR cross-linking induced the association of Grb-2 with tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT (Fig.1 A). Phospho-LAT was detected in SOS but not Vav immunoprecipitates of TCR-stimulated Jurkat T cell lysates. Interestingly, ZAP-70 was found to interact with SOS, Vav, and Grb-2 in unstimulated T cells, and these associations were significantly enhanced after TCR stimulation. These observations demonstrate for the first time that ZAP-70 interacts with SOS in T cells. Moreover, Grb-2, SOS, and Vav were present in immunoprecipitates of ZAP-70 (data not shown). TCR ligation also stimulated the association of SOS and Vav with Grb-2 as well as the interaction of SOS and Vav. The relative stoichiometry of interaction induced by TCR ligation between phospho-LAT and SOS was about 10-fold less than that between phospho-LAT and Grb-2, despite the use of equal amounts of anti-SOS and anti-Grb-2 Abs for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1 A). By comparison, a similar relative stoichiometry of interaction between ZAP-70 and either SOS, Vav, or Grb-2 was observed. Most phospho-LAT molecules are palmitoylated and are localized in Triton X-100-insoluble GEM (26.Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Partitioning of LAT to GEM may therefore diminish the co-precipitation of phospho-LAT with SOS and Vav when these membrane proteins are solubilized in Triton X-100. This notion was supported by the finding that solubilization of these proteins inn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, a nonionic detergent that dissociates GEM while preserving protein-protein interactions, significantly increased the co-precipitation of phospho-LAT with both SOS and Vav (Fig. 1 B). This result suggests that TCR cross-linking induces the partitioning of a significant proportion of SOS and Vav to LAT-containing GEM. In addition, T cell lysis byn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside preserves and does not further enhance Grb-2/ZAP-70, SOS/ZAP-70, and SOS/Vav associations (Fig. 1 C), indicating that these interactions are mostly GEM-independent. We next analyzed whether the SOS/ZAP-70 interaction in T cells depends on the presence of Grb-2. SOS was immunoprecipitated from T cell lysates after several rounds of immunodepletion of Grb-2 with an anti-Grb-2 Ab. The high efficiency of Grb-2 immunodepletion was confirmed by immunoblotting of depleted cell lysates with anti-Grb-2 (data not shown). If such interaction depends on the presence of Grb-2, immunodepletion of Grb-2, which bridges the binding of SOS with ZAP-70 or LAT, would be expected to remove ZAP-70 and LAT from SOS immunoprecipitates. Fig. 1 D shows that TCR stimulation significantly increased the amounts of ZAP-70 and LAT that co-immunoprecipitated with SOS in nondepleted T cell lysates. Conversely, sequential Grb-2 immunodepletion rendered the SOS immunoprecipitates virtually devoid of detectable ZAP-70, LAT, and Grb-2. These findings are consistent with the formation of TCR-induced trimeric SOS·Grb-2·LAT complexes and, more importantly, provide the first demonstration of SOS/Grb-2/ZAP-70 interactions in TCR-stimulated T cells. The requirement of TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation for the association of ZAP-70 with Grb-2·SOS complexes was analyzed. We determined the relative amounts of ZAP-70 in Grb-2 and SOS immunoprecipitates from TCR-activated Jurkat T cells treated for 3 h prior to stimulation with 5 μm herbimycin A, a potent inhibitor of tyrosine phosphorylation (40.Shores E.W. Tran T. Grinberg A. Sommers C.L. Shen H. Love P.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 893-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Herbimycin A treatment markedly reduced the TCR-stimulated binding of ZAP-70 to Grb-2 and SOS but did not significantly affect the constitutive association of these molecules (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, analysis of the Lck-deficient JCaM1.6 T cells demonstrated that Lck, which is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 and LAT (25.Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 31.Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), is essential for the inducible binding of ZAP-70 and LAT to Grb-2 in the plasma membrane of Jurkat T cells (Fig. 2 B). This result, coupled with the induced formation of Grb-2·ZAP-70"
https://openalex.org/W2091731404,"Pig heart mitochondrial NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is the most extensively studied among the mammalian isocitrate dehydrogenases. The crystal structure of Escherichia coliisocitrate dehydrogenase and sequence alignment of porcine withE. coli isocitrate dehydrogenase suggests that the porcine Arg101, Arg110, Arg120, and Arg133 are candidates for roles in substrate binding. The four arginines were separately mutated to glutamine using a polymerase chain reaction method. Wild type and mutant enzymes were each expressed in E. coli, isolated as maltose binding fusion proteins, then cleaved with thrombin, and purified to yield homogeneous porcine isocitrate dehydrogenase. The R120Q mutant has a specific activity, as well as K m values for isocitrate, Mn2+, and NADP+ similar to wild type enzyme, indicating that Arg120 is not needed for function. The specific activities of R101Q, R110Q, and R133Q are 1.73, 1.30, and 19.7 μmols/min/mg, respectively, as compared with 39.6 units/mg for wild type enzyme. The R110Q and R133Q enzymes exhibit K m values for isocitrate that are increased more than 400- and 165-fold, respectively, as compared with wild type. TheKm values for Mn2+, but not for NADP+, are also elevated indicating that binding of the metal-isocitrate complex is impaired in these mutants. It is proposed that the positive charges of Arg110 and Arg133normally strengthen the binding of the negatively charged isocitrate by electrostatic attraction. The R101Q mutant shows smaller, but significant increases in the Km values for isocitrate and Mn2+; however, the marked decrease ink cat suggests a role for Arg101 in catalysis. The V max of wild type enzyme depends on the ionized form of an enzymic group of pK 5.5, and this pK aes is similar for the R101Q and R120Q enzymes. In contrast, the pK aes for R110Q and R133Q enzymes increases to 6.4 and 7.4, respectively, indicating that the positive charges of Arg110 and Arg133 normally lower the pK of the nearby catalytic base to facilitate its ionization. These results may be understood in terms of the structure of the porcine NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase generated by the Insight II Modeler Program, based on the x-ray coordinates of theE. coli enzyme.

Pep. Protein Rev. 1983; 1: 41-69Google Scholar). The enzyme is a homodimer (2.Kelly J.H. Plaut G.W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 330-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Bailey J.M. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5367-5377Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), with a subunit mass of 46,600 Da consisting of 413 amino acids of determined sequence (4.Haselbach R.J. Colman R.F. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6219-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A13C-NMR study using specifically enriched isocitrate demonstrated that all three carboxyls of the substrate remain fully ionized from pH 5.5 to 7.5 when bound to the enzyme, although the carboxylates of free isocitrate become protonated over this pH range (5.Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3461-3466Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This result could be due to the presence of positively charged groups in the region of the substrate binding site. The first evidence of the importance of arginines in the function of NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase came from the inactivation of the pig heart enzyme by 2,3-butanedione (6.Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3378-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A maximum of four arginines were implicated in catalytic activity and, because isocitrate markedly decreased the inactivation rate, it was suggested that at least some of these residues were at or near the isocitrate binding site. Whereas no crystal structure of a mammalian isocitrate dehydrogenase has yet been determined, the structure of the Escherichia coli NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is known (7.Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H. Koshland D.E. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8635-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 8.Hurley J.H. Dean A.M.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9310-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this bacterial enzyme, Arg119, Arg129, and Arg153 interact with the carboxylates of isocitrate, and Ser113 is also close to the substrate (8.Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Koshland D.E. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8671-8678Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Alignment of the amino acid sequence of E. coli isocitrate dehydrogenase with that of the porcine enzyme reveals only about 12% identity (plus about 34% similarity). However, there are conserved amino acids among those known to interact with the substrate in the E. coli enzyme. Fig.1 shows the amino acid sequence alignment in this region between three eukaryotic enzymes (pig, rat, and yeast) and the E. coli enzyme. In the porcine enzyme, Arg110 and Arg133 line up, respectively, with the E. coli Arg119 and Arg153. Arg101 of the pig isocitrate dehydrogenase is aligned withE. coli's Arg112, which is close to Ser113. There is some uncertainty in the alignment in the middle of the region illustrated; however, Arg120 is the only such residue in this portion of the porcine enzyme and may be comparable to Arg132 or Arg129 of the E. coli enzyme. In this paper, to test the roles of the positively charged Arg101, Arg110, Arg120, and Arg133 as determinants of isocitrate affinity and catalysis by porcine dehydrogenase, each of these arginines was mutated to the neutral glutamine. Here, we report the procedures for mutagenesis, expression, and purification of the mutant enzymes, as well as the characterization of the physical and kinetic properties of these enzymes. A preliminary version of this work has been presented (10.Soundar S. Danek B. Colman R.F. Protein Sci. 1999; 8 Suppl. 1: 138Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA). Plasmid pMal-c2, E. colistrain TB1, T4 DNA ligase, and amylose resin were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The restriction enzymes,BamHI and Bpu1102I, as well as proteinase K were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Pfu DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Dye-conjugated DNA primers were synthesized by LI-COR, Inc. (Lincoln, NE). Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and Wizard Plus Maxi and Miniprep DNA purification systems were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Bovine plasma thrombin and human α-thrombin were obtained from Sigma or Enzyme Research Labs, Inc. (South Bend, IN). Ultraclean 15 DNA purification kit was obtained from MoBio Labs., Inc (Solana Beach, CA), and the Superose-12 gel filtration column was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Chemicals and biochemicals were supplied by Sigma unless otherwise specified. A 1.2-kbp1 cDNA-encoding pig heart mitochondrial NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase was previously cloned into a bacterial expression vector pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs), which yields the enzyme as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein (11.Nagai K. Thogersen H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This vector was later reconstructed with a thrombin cleavage site, as described previously, and was used to express the wild type enzyme (12.Soundar S. Jennings G.T. McAlister-Henn L. Colman R.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This vector was used in the present study for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using a megaprimer PCR method (13.Tao B.Y. Lee K.C.P. Griffin H.G. Griffin A.M. PCR Technology: Current Innovations. CRC Press, Cleveland, OH1994: 74Google Scholar). The mutagenesis was carried out in two PCR steps: the first step amplifies a segment of template DNA using a mutagenic oligonucleotide and a reverse end primer encoded with aBamHI restriction site. The PCR product was then incorporated in the second PCR step to produce a 1.66-kbp DNA in conjunction with a third forward end primer encoded with aBpu1102I restriction site. The Bpu1102I site is located in the malE gene 379 base pairs upstream of IDP1 DNA, and the BamHI site is encoded at the terminal of the IDP1 DNA. The oligonucleotides used to generate mutant enzymes were: R101Q (5′-CCAATGGAACCATCCAGAACATCCTCGGGG), R110Q (5′-GGGACTGTTTTCCAGGAGCCCATCATCTGC), R120Q (5′-GCAAGAACATCCCACAGCTTGTGCCTGGC), and R133Q (5′-GCCCATCACCATCGGCCAGCACGCTCACGGCGACC). The underlined codons are those mutated to glutamine. The end primers, included to flank the DNA region for amplification, were BpuF (5′-GGCGTGCTGAGCGCAGGTATTAACGCCGCCAGTCCG) and BamHI R (5′-CTAGAGGATCCTTACTACTGCCGGCCCAGAGCTCTGTC). PCR was carried out in a Robocycler Gradient 96 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50–100 ng of 7.88-kbp template DNA, 500 ng of each oligonucleotide, 0.25 mm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of cloned Pfu DNA polymerase. Denaturation, annealing, and polymerization were performed at 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2.5 min, respectively, for 30 cycles. Each reaction was initiated with an additional denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min and terminated at 72 °C for 10 min after the above 30 cycles of reaction were completed. The first PCR step DNA product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and extracted using the Ultraclean 15 DNA purification system. Before the overhangs are removed from the 1.66-kbp second step PCR product, 200 μl of the PCR pool was treated with 4 μl of 10% SDS and 6 μl containing 6 μg of proteinase K enzyme at 55 °C for 30 min. DNA was then extracted twice using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1 v/v) and washed in chloroform once. DNA was precipitated in cold ethanol with 3 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, at −80 °C for 15 min. The DNA was separated by centrifugation, and the pellet was washed in 70% ethanol and then dissolved in 10 mm Tris chloride, pH 7.5, buffer. To remove the overhangs, the DNA in 25 μl was treated with 20 units of each ofBamHI and Bpu1102I at 37 °C for 5 h. The DNA was then gel-purified and ligated. The ligation mixture containing a molar ratio of 2:1 of insert DNA to 6.22-kbp vector DNA was pretreated at 65 °C for 5 min and then incubated at 16 °C for 15 h with 400 units of T4 DNA ligase. Vector DNA was previously gel-purified after treating 7.88 kbp of DNA withBamHI/Bpu1102I and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase enzymes. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli TB1 competent cells and grown on LB plates containing ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml). Colonies were subcultured, and the plasmid DNA was isolated using the Promega DNA purification system. To ensure proper ligation of insert and vector, the plasmid was digested withBamHI/Bpu1102I enzymes, and the release of 1.66 kbp of DNA was observed. The desired mutation and fidelity of PCR amplification was confirmed by sequence analysis using the LI-COR sequencing protocol (LI-COR 4200 Long Readir Sequencer) at the University of Delaware's Cell Biology Core Facility. The procedure previously described for expression and purification of wild type enzyme (12.Soundar S. Jennings G.T. McAlister-Henn L. Colman R.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was adopted here for mutant enzyme preparation, with a few modifications. E. coli cells transformed with mutant pMalcIDP1 were grown at 37 °C in 8 liters of LB broth (4 × 2 liter) containing ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) toA 600 nm = 0.4 cell density. Isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.3 mm concentration to induce expression, and the incubation was continued for 20–24 h at 25 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min and suspended in 800 ml of cold 0.02 m triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol, 0.2 mNa2SO4, and 2 mm MnSO4(Buffer A). Cells were frozen in 2 × 400 ml volume and lysed by sonication at 20 KHz and 475 W for 10 min with a large probe in a semithawed condition in cold water. The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and the clear supernatant was collected after removing the debris. The fusion protein was separated from the 800 ml of crude extract by passing it through 75 ml of amylose resin in 2 h in a sintered glass funnel at 4 °C. The resin had previously been equilibrated in Buffer A. This step removes the endogenous E. coli isocitrate dehydrogenase, which is not bound to the amylose resin (12.Soundar S. Jennings G.T. McAlister-Henn L. Colman R.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After washing with 2 liters of Buffer A, the resin was transferred into a column, and the fusion protein was eluted with 10 mm maltose as described (12.Soundar S. Jennings G.T. McAlister-Henn L. Colman R.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The enzyme was cleaved from the maltose-binding protein by incubating the fusion protein with human or bovine plasma thrombin (41 units/mg fusion protein) at 25 °C for 48 h in the presence of 4 mm isocitrate and 2 mm MnSO4 to stabilize the cleaved enzyme. The digest was dialyzed against 0.018m triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 7.1, containing 10% glycerol, 0.06 m Na2SO4, and 1 mm MnSO4 (Buffer B) and applied to a Matrex gel Red-A resin equilibrated with Buffer B to separate pig heart isocitrate dehydrogenase from the maltose-binding protein and thrombin. The enzyme was eluted by 0.018 m triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10% glycerol, and 0.4 mNa2SO4 (12.Soundar S. Jennings G.T. McAlister-Henn L. Colman R.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The fractions that contained high specific activity were pooled and reapplied to the amylose resin as described (12.Soundar S. Jennings G.T. McAlister-Henn L. Colman R.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to remove any uncleaved fusion protein. The final gel filtration step described previously (12.Soundar S. Jennings G.T. McAlister-Henn L. Colman R.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) has been eliminated, as this modified procedure yields more than 95% pure enzyme after the second step of purification. Proteins from uninduced and isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced E. coli TB1 cells and protein aliquots at different steps of purification were analyzed in a 15% polyacrylamide slab gel (Laemmli system) containing 0.1% SDS in a discontinuous pH electrophoresis system (14.Blackshear P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Preparation of stacking and resolving gel, electrophoresis running conditions, protein fixing, staining, and destaining solutions were followed as described (15.Soundar S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5264-5271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequences of wild type and mutant enzymes (1 nmol) were determined using an Applied Biosystem gas-phase protein sequenator (Model 470A) equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Model 120) and computer (Model 900A). Gel filtration was carried out using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a Superose-12 column (1 × 30 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Wild type and mutant enzymes (0.1–1.0 mg) in 0.4 ml were applied to the column, which was previously equilibrated with 0.1m triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 7.7, containing 10% glycerol and 0.3 m Na2SO4. The proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, and 0.6-ml fractions were collected. Standard proteins, applied and eluted under the same conditions used for isocitrate dehydrogenase, were catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa). The column had a total volume (Vt) of 20.1 ml and a void volume (Vo) of 6.9 ml, as determined byl-tyrosine and blue dextran 2000, respectively. The protein concentrations in the fractions were measured at A 280 nm from which the elution volume (Ve) for each protein was determined. Circular dichroism was conducted using a Jasco model J-710 spectropolarimeter. Measurement of the ellipticity as a function of wavelength between 250 and 200 nm were made using a 0.1-cm path length quartz cell. Wild type and mutant proteins (0.15 mg/ml) in 0.025m triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 7.7, containing 10% glycerol and 0.075 m Na2SO4 were used for circular dichroism measurements. The mean residue molar ellipticity [θ] (deg cm2 mol−1) was calculated from the equation [θ] = θ/(10nCl), where θ is the measured ellipticity in millidegrees, C is the molar concentration of protein, l is the path length of the cell in cm andn is the number of residues/subunit of enzyme (n = 413 for pig heart NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase). Enzyme assays were performed at 25 °C by monitoring the time-dependent reduction of NADP+ from the UV absorbance of NADPH at 340 nm. The standard assay solution (1 ml) was 30 mm triethanolamine chloride buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm NADP+, 4 mmdl-isocitrate, and 2 mm MnSO4; and the specific activity is defined as the μmol of NADPH produced/min/mg protein under these conditions. A subunit M r of 46,600 (4.Haselbach R.J. Colman R.F. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6219-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the concentration of enzyme subunits and the protein concentration was determined from E280 nm1% = 10.8 (16.Johanson R.A. Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 207: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For K mdeterminations, the concentration of either coenzyme, isocitrate or Mn2+, was varied, and the other substrates were maintained at the standard concentrations. For the isocitrateK m determination, concentrations of isocitrate varied between 0.005 and 20.0 mm; for the Mn2+ K m measurement, 0.1 μm to 10 mm MnSO4; and for the NADP+ K m determination, 5 μm to 2.5 mm NADP+ were used. The K mand V max values were calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plots. The pH dependence of V max was measured using the following buffers: pH 5.0–5.8 (30 mm sodium acetate), pH 5.8–7.4 (30 mm imidazole chloride), and pH 6.8–8.0 (30 mm triethanolamine chloride) buffers containing 2 mm MnSO4 and 0.1 mmNADP+ at 25 °C. The buffers were all 30 mmin anion concentration. To ascertain the concentration of isocitrate required to saturate the R110Q and R133Q enzymes, theV max and K m values for isocitrate were determined at the lowest pH values using isocitrate solutions adjusted to the corresponding pH. The pH rate profiles were measured using 4 mm isocitrate for the wild type and R120Q enzymes, 8 mm isocitrate for R101Q enzyme, and 20 mm isocitrate for R110Q and R133Q enzymes. Under these conditions, all the enzymes were saturated with every substrate. A stock solution of 0.25 mdl-isocitrate in water was prepared, and its pH was adjusted to 5.0 before including it in the assay mixture. The final pH of the assayed solution was measured at each pH. As the crystal structure of the mammalian enzyme has not yet been determined, modeling studies were carried out on an SGI workstation using Insight II (Biosym/MSI, San Diego, CA). The sequence alignment was performed using Clustal W for sequences of NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase of pig heart (mitochondrial), E. coli, yeast (mitochondrial), and rat (cytosolic), which is almost the same as we published earlier in Fig. 3 of Ref. 4.Haselbach R.J. Colman R.F. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6219-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar. The crystal structure of E. coliNADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase was used as the reference structure (8.Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Koshland D.E. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8671-8678Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) for the Modeler program (a module under homology), which calculated energy-minimized models for the monomeric structure of the pig heart NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. Spatial restraints, expressed as probability density functions from the reference protein, were then optimized. The model with the lowest value of objective function (F, molecular probability density functions violation) fits best to the reference structure. Out of the models generated from different alignments, a model from the best alignment was chosen by comparing the lowestF values. The porcine NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, with glutamine substituted for arginine at each of the positions 101, 110, 120, and 133, were generated using expression vector pMALcIDP1 by a megaprimer PCR method (3.Bailey J.M. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5367-5377Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The first and second PCR runs yielded approximately 0.86 and 1.66 kbp DNAs, respectively. Although the 1.66-kbp DNA was incubated with the BamHI andBpu1102I restriction enzymes to remove the overhang and was gel purified, it did not initially ligate with the 6.22-kbp vector DNA. However, the ligation was successful if the 1.66 kbp DNA had been treated with proteinase K and SDS prior to incubation with the restriction enzymes. A small number of colonies resulted from self-ligated vector DNA on transformation, even though the vector DNA had been treated with alkaline phosphatase. Such colonies were avoided, and colonies that yielded plasmid DNA, which produced a 1.66-kbp insert DNA upon BamHI/Bpu1102I digestion, were selected for expression. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the mutations had been introduced in all of the mutant plasmid DNAs and that the sequences of the PCR-amplified DNA were correct. The cells were grown in 8 liters of culture medium, and the isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced expression time was increased from 4 h (12.Soundar S. Jennings G.T. McAlister-Henn L. Colman R.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to 20–24 h to improve the level of expression of the fusion protein. The sonication of cells in one pulse for 10 min yielded more soluble fusion protein than obtained previously (12.Soundar S. Jennings G.T. McAlister-Henn L. Colman R.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The time for incubation of the fusion protein with thrombin was also increased from 18 to 48 h. Under these conditions only trace amounts of uncleaved fusion protein remained. This procedure yielded approximately 15 mg of pure protein as compared with the 1.2 mg obtained by the procedure reported previously (12.Soundar S. Jennings G.T. McAlister-Henn L. Colman R.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that the wild type and mutant enzymes eluted after the second amylose column were homogeneous, as evaluated by polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. The subunit molecular size of the four mutant proteins is similar to that of wild type enzyme. 2Although it appears that the mobility of the R120Q mutant is slightly retarded relative to the other samples, this difference is not considered significant because it was observed only in this gel and is probably due to uneven loading of this sample. The sequences of the porcine and E. coli isocitrate dehydrogenases differ in nine of the first ten amino acids. The N-terminal sequencing of these purified wild type and mutant porcine enzymes indicate that they are not contaminated with the E. coli enzyme. To test the molecular size of the native wild type and mutant enzymes, they were subjected to gel filtration on a Superose-12 column, equilibrated with 0.1 m triethanolamine chloride, pH 7.7, containing 10% glycerol and 0.3 m Na2SO4. The wild type and mutant enzymes all elute between aldolase and bovine serum albumin with an average elution volume of 10.8 ml. The results indicate that wild type and mutant isocitrate dehydrogenases exist as dimers in solution. The molecular weight of the isocitrate dehydrogenases was determined using a plot of (Ve -Vo)/(Vt -Vo) against log (M r) for the protein standards. They all exhibit an apparent molecular mass of approximately 95,000 Da, indicating that the mutations do not affect the oligomeric state of isocitrate dehydrogenase. Circular dichroism spectra of the expressed enzymes were measured to ascertain whether these mutations cause conformational change in the enzyme. The spectra of all mutants are similar to that of the wild type enzyme; all exhibit minima at 208 and 225 nm. These results indicate that the mutations do not cause appreciable change in the secondary structure of these isocitrate dehydrogenases. TableI shows the specific activities of wild type and mutant enzymes under standard conditions, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified wild type enzyme expressed in E. coli cells exhibits a specific activity, which is similar to that of the enzyme isolated previously from pig heart mitochondria in our laboratory (15.Soundar S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5264-5271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The R101Q and R110Q mutants show marked decreases in specific activity, whereas the R133Q mutant is 50% as active as wild type, indicating that the functions of these three mutant enzymes are impaired. The mutant R120Q has a specific activity similar to that of wild type.Table IKinetic parameters for wild type and mutant NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases: specific activity and Km values for Mn 2+ and NADP +EnzymeSpecific activityK m-Mn2+K m-NADP+μmol/min/mgμmμmWild Type39.60.21 ± 0.025 ± 0.19R101Q1.7362 ± 5.545 ± 0.48R110Q1.3020 ± 1.4618 ± 0.96R120Q34.90.50 ± 0.026 ± 0.26R133Q19.7240 ± 1211 ± 0.93As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the assay for specific activity was conducted in 30 mm triethanolamine chloride, pH 7.4, with 4 mm dl-isocitrate, 2 mmMn2+, and 0.1 mm NADP+.

The data were analyzed by Lineweaver-Burk plots. All four mutants exhibit values of K m for the coenzyme, NADP+, similar to that of wild type enzyme, as shown in Table I. These results indicate that these arginines are not involved in coenzyme binding. The R120Q mutant also has aK m for Mn2+ similar to that of wild type indicating that Arg120 is not involved in Mn2+binding.

Previous work has demonstrated that C/EBPα and C/EBPβ have the potential to mediate the cAMP responsiveness of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in liver cells. However, these studies used GAL4 fusion proteins and artificial promoter-reporter gene vectors in transfection experiments; as a result, these studies only indicated that both isoforms had the potential to mediate the hormonal response and not which isoform actually participated in vivo. To address this issue, we produced hepatoma cell lines that stably expressed either a dominant negative inhibitor or antisense RNA for these two main liver C/EBP isoforms. Inhibition of all C/EBP isoforms via expression of the dominant negative protein eliminated cAMP responsiveness, and reduced glucocorticoid responsiveness, of the endogenous PEPCK gene in hepatoma cells. Antisense directed against C/EBPα mRNA, which reduced C/EBPα protein levels by nearly 80%, also significantly reduced the cAMP responsiveness of the endogenous PEPCK promoter, whereas antisense directed against C/EBPβ was without effect. There was no major alteration in cAMP signaling in the C/EBPα antisense cells, as cAMP induction of the C/EBPβ gene was similar to that in wild-type H4IIE cells. These data suggest that the α-isoform of C/EBP is specifically utilized for mediating the cAMP responsiveness of the PEPCK gene.

J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1875-1878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and accordingly it is expressed at highest levels in liver and kidney (1.Rognstad R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1875-1878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Alleyne G.A.O. Scullard G.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1969; 48: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 3.Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The promoter of PEPCK-C is hormonally responsive and contains a number of cis-elements that bindtrans-acting factors capable of mediating multiple hormonal signals (for review, see Ref. 4.Hanson R.W. Patel Y.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 203-281PubMed Google Scholar). In liver, the PEPCK-C promoter is negatively regulated by insulin but induced by glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, and glucagon, via cAMP (2.Alleyne G.A.O. Scullard G.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1969; 48: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5.Tilghman S.M. Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Hopgood M.F. Ballard F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The responsiveness of the PEPCK-C promoter to cAMP is relatively liver-specific and is mediated by a group of cis-elements collectively known as a cAMP response unit. The cAMP response unit includes a cAMP response element (CRE), which is capable of binding molecules of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB); three binding sites for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) isoforms; and one binding site for AP-1 (7.Roesler W.J. Simard J. Graham J.G. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14276-14283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Yeagley D. Agati J.M. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18743-18750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This complex organization of DNA sequences and DNA-binding proteins likely allows for intricate control of tissue-specific expression and the integration of various signaling pathways. For example, the response of the PEPCK-C promoter to thyroid hormones is mediated not only by the binding of an activated thyroid hormone receptor to a typical thyroid hormone response element (9.Giralt M. Park E.A. Liu J.S. Gurney A.L. Hakimi P. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21991-21996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Schmidt E.D.L van Beeren M. Glass C.K. Wiersinga W.M. Lamers W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), but also requires one of the C/EBP binding sites utilized in the CRU (11.Park E.A. Song S. Vinson C. Roesler W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 211-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a potential integration of the thyroid hormone response and the cAMP response of the PEPCK-C promoter, brought about by this C/EBP molecule, which may account for the synergistic activation of the promoter by these two signaling pathways. CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins are members of the basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors (12.Landshultz W.H. Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 13.Landschultz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar). The two main C/EBP isoforms expressed in liver are C/EBPα and C/EBPβ (14.Alam T. An M.R. Papaconstantinou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5021-5024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α-isoform of C/EBP is considered to be a central regulator of energy homeostasis (15.McKnight S.L. Lane M.D. Gluecksohn-Waelsch S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2021-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), being involved in the trans-activation of a number of metabolically important genes (16.Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Nizielski S.E.

Shuman J. Friedman A. Hanson R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6264-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The importance of C/EBPα in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis has been particularly well demonstrated by whole animal and tissue-specific knockout studies (18.Wang N. Finegold M.J. Bradley A.

Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6014-6022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The β-isoform of C/EBP also appears to have some role in metabolism (20.Liu S. Croniger C. Arizmendi C. Harada-Shiba M. Ren J. Poli V. Hanson R.W. Friedman J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), as well as regulating the immune response (21.Tanaka T. Akira S. Yoshida K. Umemoto M.

Prior work by our laboratory using GAL4-C/EBP fusion proteins suggested that either C/EBP isoform has the potential to mediate the cAMP response of PEPCK-C in liver (11.Park E.A. Song S. Vinson C. Roesler W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 211-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, to date there has been no evidence in regards to which specific isoform mediates the cAMP responsiveness of the endogenous PEPCK-C gene in liver cells. The goal of this present study was to inhibit C/EBP activity in hepatoma cells and assess what effect it had on the cAMP responsiveness of the endogenous PEPCK-C gene.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2040-2047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), corresponding to full-length GBF-F, into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of MSV-C/EBPβ (23.Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar), thereby displacing the full-length C/EBPβ insert. The GBF-FEcoRI/BamHI fragment was obtained from pRGX-GBF-F by polymerase chain reaction amplification utilizing a forward polymerase chain reaction primer designed to introduce anEcoRI site into the 5′-untranslated region of the GBF-F cDNA sequence. The forward and reverse polymerase chain reaction primers utilized to amplify the approximately 400-base pair GBF-FEcoRI/BamHI fragment from pRGX-GBF-F were as follows: GBF-F forward, 5′-TATCGAATTCATGCCAGTGAAGGAT-3′ and GBF-F reverse, 5′-TATCGGATCCAAGCTTGCCGTC-3′. The plasmid designed to express C/EBPα antisense RNA (MSV-C/EBPα anti) was constructed by subcloning thePstI/BamHI fragment of pMSV-C/EBPα (24.Friedman A.D. Landshultz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), corresponding to nucleotides +782 to +131 of the rat C/EBPα cDNA sequence, into the PstI/BamHI sites of the multiple cloning site of pBluescript® SK+ (Stratagene) to produce SK+-C/EBPα anti. The EcoRI/BamHI fragment of SK+-C/EBPα anti was then ligated into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of MSV-C/EBPβ to produce MSV-C/EBPα anti. The plasmid designed to express C/EBPβ antisense RNA (MSV-C/EBPβ anti) was constructed by subcloning the PstI fragment of pSCt-LAP (25.Descombes P. Chojkier M. Lichtsteiner S. Falvey E. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), corresponding to nucleotides +736 to +246 of the rat C/EBPβ cDNA sequence, into the PstI site of pBluescript® SK+ to produce SK+-C/EBPβ anti. The EcoRI/BamHI fragment of pBluescript® SK+-C/EBPβ anti was then ligated into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of MSV-C/EBPβ to produce MSV-C/EBPβ anti. The plasmid designed to express C/EBPα sense RNA (MSV-GαN175) was constructed by ligating the EcoRI/BamHI fragment of pGαN175 (26.Roesler W.J. Park E.A. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14950-14957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), corresponding to nucleotides +117 to +658 of the rat C/EBPα cDNA sequence (coding for amino acids 6–175 of C/EBPα) into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of MSV-C/EBPβ to produce MSV-C/EBPα sense. The plasmids designed for the production of ribonuclease protection assay probes for detection of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and PEPCK mRNA have been described previously (27.Crosson S.M. Davies G.F. Roesler W.J. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The plasmid designed for the production of ribonuclease protection assay probes for detection of C/EBPα antisense RNA was produced by ligating theEcoRI/BamHI fragment of pGαN175, corresponding to nucleotides +117 to +658 of the rat C/EBPα cDNA sequence, into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pTZ18R (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Inc.). This vector was linearized for probe production by digestion with HindIII, which cuts at position +310 of the pTZ18R multiple cloning site, producing a 573-nucleotide probe that protects 541 nucleotides of the C/EBPα antisense RNA. The vector utilized as a template for ribonuclease protection analysis probes for the detection of C/EBPβ antisense RNA (19R-LAP) was constructed by ligating the PstI/PstI fragment of pSCt-LAP, corresponding to nucleotides +246 to +736 of the rat C/EBPβ cDNA sequence, into the PstI site of pTZ19R. This vector was linearized for probe production by digestion withEcoRI, which cuts at nucleotide +315 of the multiple cloning site of pTZ19R, producing a 550-nucleotide probe, which protects 490 nucleotides of the C/EBPβ antisense RNA. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% calf serum. Where indicated, cells were treated with 200 μm 8-CPT-cAMP or 1 μm dexamethasone for the times indicated and then harvested for RNA isolation. Rat hepatoma H4IIE cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitate method (28.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.32-16.38Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the appropriate expression vector and pSV2neo (InforMax, Inc.) at a ratio of 10:1, respectively. The total amount of DNA introduced per transfection was 15 μg/100-mm plate. After 3 days, cells were placed in medium containing 400 μg/ml gentamicin. Individual clones, once isolated and expanded, were maintained in medium containing 100 μg/ml gentamicin. Total cellular RNA was extracted from cultured cells using TRIzol™ reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNase protection assays and Northern analysis were conducted as described previously (27.Crosson S.M. Davies G.F. Roesler W.J. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29.Davies G.F. Khandelwal R.L. Roesler W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Quantification of signals was performed by densitometric scanning of autoradiograms using the Un-Scan-It™ automated digitizing system (Silk Scientific Inc.). Verification that an equivalent amount of RNA was analyzed from each sample was accomplished by RNA slot blot analysis using a radiolabeled 18 S rRNA probe (30.Katz R.A. Erlanger B.F Guntaka R.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 73: 9258-9264Google Scholar). The methods for preparation of cellular lysates and Western blot analysis have been described previously (31.Davies G.F. Crosson S.M. Khandelwal R.L. Roesler W.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Blots were quantified by densitometric scanning as described above. To address which C/EBP isoform participates in mediating the cAMP responsiveness of the PEPCK promoter, H4IIE cell lines stably expressing either a dominant negative molecule, or antisense to C/EBPα or C/EBPβ RNA, were prepared. A number of clones of each cell line were examined for the levels of expression (data not shown). The highest expressing clone was selected for further characterization. The percent or fold changes in expression levels (either in RNA or protein) listed under “Results” are the averages ± S.E. of data collected from at least three independent experiments. To confirm the general requirement of C/EBP isoforms for PEPCK-C basal and cAMP inducible expression, we prepared a H4IIE cell line that expressed a dominant negative inhibitor of C/EBP, GBF-F (22.Olive M. Williams S.C. Dezan C. Johnson P.F. Vinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2040-2047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). GBF-F is an engineered molecule consisting of the DNA-binding domain of the plant bZIP protein GBF-1 fused to the “F” leucine zipper, a dimerization domain designed to preferentially form inactive heterodimers with C/EBP isoforms. High levels of GBF-F expression within the intact cell should indiscriminately inhibit the transcriptional activity of all C/EBP isoforms by formation of inactive heterodimers. The level of GBF-F mRNA in the GBF-F D4 clone, and its absence in wild-type H4IIE cells, is shown in Fig.1 A. Fig. 1 B shows a representative autoradiogram that demonstrates the effects of GBF-F expression on C/EBPα and C/EBPβ mRNA levels in the GBF-F D4 cell line relative to wild-type H4IIE cells. The presence of GBF-F resulted in a 26 ± 8% reduction in C/EBPα mRNA levels and a 60 ± 4% reduction in C/EBPβ mRNA levels. Despite the repressive effect of GBF-F expression on C/EBPβ mRNA levels, no alterations in C/EBPβ protein between GBF-F D4 cells and wild-type H4IIE cells was detectable (Fig. 1 C). However, the levels of C/EBPα protein were reduced by 59 ± 3% in GBF-F D4 cells in comparison with wild-type H4IIE cells. It should be noted that RNase protection analysis of C/EBP mRNA, shown throughout the figures of this paper, gave either one or two bands. This is a result of the inefficiency of the in vitrotranscription reactions utilized to produce the antisense probes, in which two probe species of different sizes were generated. Autoradiograms showing what appears to be only one protected species simply have not been resolved to as great an extent to those displaying two protected species. Because GBF-F inhibits the activity of all C/EBP isoforms, we next prepared cell lines expressing antisense RNA for either the α- or β-isoform. Fig. 2 A shows the levels of expression of the C/EBPα antisense RNA in the αA B1 H4IIE cell line in comparison with wild-type H4IIE cells. The expression of C/EBPα antisense RNA reduced the mRNA level of C/EBPα by 78 ± 5% in comparison with wild type H4IIE cells (Fig.2 B). More importantly, the levels of C/EBPα protein were also decreased in the αA B1 cell line by 76 ± 9% in comparison to wild-type cells (Fig. 2 C). An interesting dichotomy was observed regarding the effects of C/EBPα antisense RNA expression on C/EBPα and C/EBPβ expression. The expression of C/EBPα antisense RNA caused an up-regulation of C/EBPβ expression, in that it was seen to double both C/EBPβ mRNA (2 ± 0.3-fold) and protein levels (1.9 ± 0.2-fold) (Fig. 2, B and C) relative to wild-type H4IIE cells. Thus it would appear that while antisense expression results in the expected down-regulation of C/EBPα, there is a corresponding increase in the expression of the β-isoform of C/EBP. In the βA C4 H4IIE cell line, which expressed C/EBPβ antisense RNA (Fig. 3 A), the level of C/EBPβ mRNA was reduced by 44 ± 2% (Fig. 3 B) and its protein levels by 71 ± 2% (Fig. 3 C) relative to wild-type H4IIE cells. The levels of C/EBPα protein in the βA C4 cell line were increased by 6.4 ± 0.6-fold relative to wild-type H4IIE cells (Fig. 3 C). Interestingly, despite the increased levels of C/EBPα protein, no corresponding increase in C/EBPα mRNA was detected in these cells (Fig. 3 B). As a control for these experiments, a H4IIE stable cell line (GαN175 A3) expressing a sense C/EBPα RNA, corresponding to the coding region for amino acids 6–175, was produced. No change in C/EBPα or C/EBPβ protein levels relative to wild-type H4IIE cells was detected as a consequence of this sense C/EBPα RNA expression (data not shown). We next assessed the degree of cAMP responsiveness in the cell lines described above. Treatment of wild-type H4IIE cells with 200 μm 8-CPT-cAMP produced a 3.5 ± 0.3-fold increase in PEPCK-C mRNA. The responsiveness of PEPCK-C to an identical treatment with 8-CPT-cAMP was abolished in the GBF-F expressing cell line GBF-F D4 (1.5 ± 0.3-fold increase) (Fig.4), confirming the involvement and requirement of C/EBP isoforms for the induction of PEPCK-C expression by cAMP. Furthermore, the basal expression of the PEPCK-C gene was reduced by 35 ± 4% in the GBF-F D4 cell line relative to wild-type H4IIE cells. The specific inhibition of C/EBPα activity by antisense in the αA B1 cell line also abolished PEPCK-C cAMP responsiveness (1.2 ± 0.3-fold increase) (Fig. 4). The basal levels of PEPCK-C mRNA were also reduced in the αA B1 cell line by 70 ± 8% compared with wild-type cells. No alteration in PEPCK-C responsiveness to 8-CPT-cAMP was observed in C/EBPβ antisense-expressing βA C4 cells (Fig. 4). In fact, the 5 ± 0.5-fold induction of PEPCK-C gene expression levels by cAMP in βA C4 cells was consistently greater than that seen in wild-type H4IIE cells. No notable difference in PEPCK-C basal expression levels was observed in βA C4 cells relative to wild-type cells. No inhibition of cAMP induction of PEPCK mRNA levels was observed in the C/EBPα sense RNA expressing cell line GαN175 A3 (3.7 ± 0.2-fold increase) (Fig. 4). This result indicates that the processes of stable integration and selection themselves did not interfere with the molecular mechanisms of cAMP induction of endogenous PEPCK-C. It was possible that the effects of C/EBPα antisense were exerted through an indirect mechanism, perhaps by decreasing the levels and/or activity of a protein necessary for cAMP responsiveness, such as CREB. Thus, it was necessary to determine whether the C/EBPα antisense cells had a general defect in cAMP signaling. We assessed the effects of GBF-F and C/EBPα antisense RNA expression on the cAMP responsiveness of an endogenous H4IIE gene other than PEPCK-C. The expression of C/EBPβ is induced by cAMP (27.Crosson S.M. Davies G.F. Roesler W.J. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), by a transcriptional mechanism that is CREB-mediated (32.Niehof M. Manns N.W. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, the levels of C/EBPβ protein were induced by 3.1 ± 0.2-fold in αA B1 cells and by 3.4 ± 0.2-fold in GBF-F D4 cells by 8-CPT-cAMP, which is comparable with the 3.8 ± 0.3-fold induction observed in wild type H4IIE cells. Furthermore, the levels of CREB protein were not significantly altered relative to wild-type cells in either GBF-F D4 or αA B1 cells (data not shown). Thus, it appeared that general cAMP signaling in the C/EBPα antisense RNA and GBF-F expressing lines was not altered, supporting the hypothesis that the impairment in cAMP responsiveness of the PEPCK-C gene was due to a specific inhibition of C/EBPα activity in these cells. We also utilized these stable cell lines to assess the requirements of C/EBP for the glucocorticoid responsiveness of the PEPCK-C gene. As shown in Fig. 6, the 4.1 ± 0.5-fold induction of PEPCK-C mRNA obtained by dexamethasone treatment of wild-type H4IIE cells was not affected by antisense RNA for either C/EBPα (5.3 ± 0.5-fold) or C/EBPβ (4.9 ± 0.9-fold). However, in cells expressing GBF-F, which simultaneously inhibits the activity of all C/EBP isoforms, the level of induction of PEPCK-C mRNA in response to dexamethasone was reduced to 2.6 ± 0.1-fold (averaged from four independent experiments). The data presented in this paper identify C/EBPα as the specific C/EBP isoform that participates in the cAMP responsiveness of the PEPCK-C gene. This observation is supported by the lack of cAMP induction of PEPCK-C in both the GBF-F D4 and αA B1 cell lines, and the robust cAMP response that still occurs in the βA C4 cell line. Further support for this hypothesis is derived from the observation that the levels of C/EBPα protein are reduced in the GBF-F D4 cell line (Fig. 1), in which PEPCK-C cAMP responsiveness is abolished. Moreover, while the levels of C/EBPβ protein are increased in the αA B1 cell line (Fig. 2), the cAMP responsiveness of the PEPCK-C gene was lost (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the levels of C/EBPα protein are considerably elevated in the βA C4 cell line (Fig. 3), which consistently display an enhanced response of the PEPCK-C gene to cAMP. Further support for our hypothesis comes from the observation that C/EBPβ knockout mice show no alteration in the basal expression or cAMP inducibility of the PEPCK-C gene (20.Liu S. Croniger C. Arizmendi C. Harada-Shiba M. Ren J. Poli V. Hanson R.W. Friedman J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data indicate that C/EBPα participates in this hormonal response, whereas C/EBPβ does not. It should be noted that while C/EBPα knockout mice have been generated, assessing the cAMP responsiveness of the PEPCK-C gene has proven difficult, since the mice die shortly after birth (18.Wang N. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde N.M. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note, however, the newborn mice show an impairment in gluconeogenesis, for which PEPCK is the rate-limiting enzyme. The observation that GBF-F inhibited expression of C/EBPα expression (Fig. 1) is consistent with the autoregulatory nature of the C/EBPα gene (33.Legraverend C. Antonson P. Flodby P. Xanthopoulos K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1735-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34.Timchenko N. Wilson D.R. Taylor L.R. Abdelsayed S. Wilde M. Sawadogo M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The murine C/EBPα promoter is known to bind C/EBPα directly, and in transient transfection studies, overexpression of C/EBPα trans-activated the C/EBPα promoter (33.Legraverend C. Antonson P. Flodby P. Xanthopoulos K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1735-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The work of Timchenko et al. (34.Timchenko N. Wilson D.R. Taylor L.R. Abdelsayed S. Wilde M. Sawadogo M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also suggested autoregulation of the human C/EBPα gene. Selective inhibition of either C/EBPα or C/EBPβ in hepatoma cells by antisense affected the expression of both main hepatic C/EBP isoforms. In hepatoma cells expressing C/EBPα antisense, not only was the expression of C/EBPα affected as expected, there was also a corresponding increase in the expression of C/EBPβ (Fig. 2). Conversely, cells expressing C/EBPβ antisense displayed the expected reduction in C/EBPβ along with an up-regulation of C/EBPα protein, which, curiously, was not accompanied by elevations in C/EBPα mRNA (Fig. 3). These results suggest that there might again be some compensatory mechanism in place which functions to maintain a certain level of C/EBP protein in the liver cell. While there is mounting evidence that these two isoforms have some distinct properties, and roles in specific gene promoters, it is also clear that these two isoforms can and do bind to the same sequences in many genes, providingtrans-activation. Thus, when the level of one isoform declines and a compensatory increase in the concentration of the other occurs, genes that are dependent on C/EBPs for their constitutive level of activity could be expected to maintain their expression at or near ambient levels. The results presented in Fig. 6 suggest a requirement for C/EBP isoforms in the mediation of the glucocorticoid responsiveness of the endogenous PEPCK-C gene. The fact that inhibition of any one isoform by antisense had no affect on glucocorticoid responsiveness, whereas GBF-F expression reduced the fold responsiveness, is consistent with the hypothesis that either isoform can participate in this hormonal response. This conclusion is different from that made by Yamadaet al. (36.Yamada K. Duong D.T. Scott D.K. Wang J. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5880-5887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), who specifically assigned C/EBPβ as the accessory factor participating in the glucocorticoid responsiveness. However, it should be noted that again this conclusion was based on experiments using promoter-reporter gene constructs and GAL4-C/EBP proteins. Moreover, overexpression of the C/EBPβ fusion protein was not able to fully restore glucocorticoid responsiveness, which had been reduced due to the substitution of the C/EBP binding site for a GAL4 site. These differences in experimental design could explain the different conclusions between our study and that of Yamada et al. (36.Yamada K. Duong D.T. Scott D.K. Wang J. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5880-5887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, they are consistent in that they both point to a C/EBP protein as an important accessory factor in the glucocorticoid response. The data presented in this study offer further evidence that C/EBP proteins, particularly the α-isoform, function in mediating the effects of several hormones on gene transcription. In the case of the PEPCK promoter, C/EBPs assist in mediating the transcriptional effects of cAMP (26, 37, this study), glucocorticoids (36, this study), and T3 (9.Giralt M. Park E.A. Liu J.S.

The production of stable rat hepatoma H4IIE cell lines, expressing molecules designed to inhibit the activity of C/EBP isoforms, have allowed us to assess the requirement of these transcription factors in various cellular processes. This work has also demonstrated the need to build upon promoter-reporter gene/overexpression studies with experiments that can characterize the role that individual C/EBP isoforms play in the regulation of specific, endogenous genes that lie within a chromatin environment.

We have previously isolated receptor-associated coactivator 3 (RAC3), which belongs to the steroid receptor coactivator family. In this study, we investigated the differential mechanisms by which RAC3 interacts with and modulates the transcriptional activity of different nuclear receptors. We found that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and estrogen receptor β interact with different α-helical LXXLL motifs of RAC3. Peptides corresponding to these motifs have diverse affinities for the VDR and estrogen receptor β, and mutation of specific motifs differentially impairs the ability of RAC3 to interact with these receptors in vitro. Consequently, these mutations inhibit the enhancement of transcriptional activation by these receptors in vivo. Furthermore, we found that the activation function-2 (AF-2) domain of the retinoid X receptor interferes with RAC3 binding to a DNA-bound VDR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer, whereas the VDR AF-2 domain is required for this interaction. These results suggest a receptor-specific binding preference for the different LXXLL motifs of RAC3, which may provide flexibility for RAC3 to differentially regulate the function of different nuclear receptors.

Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar). This superfamily can be divided into three subgroups. The ERβ is a Type I receptor, which also includes receptors for steroids such as progestins, androgens, glucocorticoids, and mineralcorticoids. These receptors are coupled to heat shock proteins and sequestered to the cytoplasm in the absence of ligand. Upon hormone binding, they dissociate from the heat shock proteins, homodimerize, and translocate to the nucleus where they bind to cognate response elements consisting of palindromic repeats. The VDR is a Type II receptor like those for thyroid hormone (TR) and all-trans retinoic acid (RAR). These receptors are strictly nuclear and form heterodimers with the receptor for 9-cis retinoic acid (RXR). They also bind constitutively to response elements consisting of direct repeats (DRs). A third class of nuclear receptors is the orphan receptors, so-called because endogenous ligands for these proteins are currently unknown. Most members of the nuclear receptor superfamily share a common domain structure. The N terminus contains the variable A/B region, which also includes the ligand-independent AF-1 activation domain. The highly conserved DNA binding domain and the C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) follow this region. The LBD contains the ligand-dependent AF-2 activation domain and also mediates dimerization of nuclear receptors. In the absence of ligand, nuclear receptors are able to repress basal transcription via functional interactions with the nuclear receptor corepressors SMRT and NCoR (2.Chen J.D. Evans R.M.

SMRT and NCoR are found in complexes with the corepressor mSin3 and the histone deacetylase HDAC1, suggesting that transcriptional repression by nuclear receptors may involve histone deacetylation (4.Nagy L.

Ligand binding triggers the release of these corepressors and subsequent recruitment of coactivators through a drastic conformational change in the AF-2 domain of the receptor. Structural studies have demonstrated that helix 12, which contains the AF-2 domain, projects away from the LBD in the unbound RXR structure, but rotates nearly 180° to pack tightly against the LBD upon hormone binding in the RAR, TR, and ER (7.Brzozowski A.M.

Coactivators recruited by ligand-bound nuclear receptors include members of the SRC family of coactivators such as SRC1 (also known as NCoA-1), TIF2/GRIP1 (also known as SRC2 or NCoA-2), and RAC3/ACTR/pCIP/AIB1 (also known as SRC3 or NCoA-3) (reviewed in Refs.17.McKenna N.J.

SRC family members share an N-terminal basic helix-loop-helix/PAS-A/PAS-B domain of unknown function, centrally located receptor interaction domain, and C-terminal transcriptional activation domain.

Therefore, the mechanism by which nuclear receptors activate transcription may entail the recruitment of a coactivator complex via the AF-2 domain that can modify chromatin structure, thereby facilitating access to the promoter by the general transcription machinery. Intriguingly, members of the SRC family of coactivators have been found to contain several conserved motifs, termed NR boxes, with the consensus sequence LXXLL, where X is any amino acid (31.Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Motifs within the receptor-interacting domain and transcriptional activation domains of SRC1 and TIF2 have been demonstrated to mediate interactions with liganded nuclear receptors and CBP/p300, respectively (23.Voegel J.J.

Crystallographic and protein structure prediction analyses have indicated that these motifs form amphipathic α-helices with the leucine residues comprising a hydrophobic surface on one face of the helix (11.Shiau A.K.

Mutational analyses of the NR boxes of SRC1 and TIF2/GRIP1 have also uncovered a receptor-specific code of interaction, where different nuclear receptors require different NR boxes to interact with the coactivator (32.McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.M. Krones A. Inostroza J. Torchia J. Nolte R.T. Assa-Munt N. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies indicate that flanking residues outside the NR box may also be important to nuclear receptor-coactivator interactions. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms by which RAC3 regulates the function of the VDR and ERβ, for little is known concerning the regulation of these receptors by SRC coactivators, particularly RAC3. These analyses reveal receptor-specific interactions in which the VDR and ERβ interact with different surfaces of RAC3. We demonstrate different preferences of these receptors for specific NR boxes of RAC3 and that single mutations in these LXXLL motifs are able to severely impair the ability of RAC3 to interact with and, thus, coactivate the VDR and ERβ. In analyzing the requirement of nuclear receptor AF-2 domains, we observe that the AF-2 domain of RXR can inhibit RAC3-RID binding to the DNA-bound VDR/RXR heterodimer, whereas the AF-2 domain of VDR is required for this interaction. These data add a new level of complexity to the regulation of nuclear receptor activity by SRC coactivators and suggest that different classes of nuclear receptors may be regulated by RAC3 via different mechanisms. Far Western assays were carried out as described (20.Li H. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5948-5954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST fusion proteins were expressed in DH5α cells and purified with glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified proteins were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were denatured with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and renatured by the stepwise dilution of guanidine hydrochloride. Membranes were then blocked and hybridized overnight with35S-labeled protein. The membrane was washed, and bound probe was detected by autoradiography. 35S-Labeled probes were generated by Quick-coupled in vitrotranscription/translation (Promega). For peptide competition experiments, the given concentration of peptide was added to the probe 10 min before hybridization with the membrane. Peptide sequences were as follows: NR box i peptide (LESKGHKKLLQLLTLSSDDRGHSSL), NR box ii peptide (LQEKHRILHKLLQNGNSP), NR box iii peptide (KKKENNALLRYLLDRDD), control peptide (GSGSATATLYENKPRPPYIL). Radioactive bands were quantified by PhosphorImager using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Approximately 5 μg of purified GST fusion protein was incubated with 5 μl of 35S-labeled protein with moderate shaking at 4 °C overnight in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml BSA). The bound protein was washed three times with binding buffer, and beads were collected by centrifugation. The bound protein was eluted in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and detected by autoradiography. NR box mutants were generated with the Quick-change site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). The sequences of all mutant constructs were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide chain termination reactions using the T7 Sequenase protocol (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The sequence of the DR3 element used for VDR/RXR gel-shift assays is AGCTTAAGAGGTCAGAAAGGTCACTCGCAT. The double-stranded DR3 was end-labeled with [32P]dCTP by standard Klenow fill-in reaction. The purified probe was incubated with 35S-labeled receptors in binding buffer containing 7.5% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 100 mm KCl. Wild-type or mutant GST-RAC3-RID was eluted from glutathione-agarose beads with 10 mm reduced glutathione and added to the binding reaction. The DNA-protein complex was formed on ice for 1 h and resolved on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel, which was subsequently dried and subjected to autoradiography. HEK293 and CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 μg/μl gentamycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were plated for transfection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% resin charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum in 12- or 6-well plates 1 day before transfection. HEK293 cells were transfected using the standard calcium phosphate method, whereas CV-1 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.) Twelve hours after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and refed fresh medium containing the indicated concentration of ligand. After 24 h, cells were harvested for β-galactosidase and luciferase activities as described (35.Chen J.D. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7567-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was determined with a MLX plate luminometer (Dynex) and normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity. We have previously defined the minimal receptor interacting domain (RID) of RAC3 to be amino acids 613–752, which contains the first three LXXLL motifs (Fig.1 A) (20.Li H. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5948-5954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We wished to further determine if different receptors were capable of binding to the same regions of RAC3. To accomplish this, we purified a panel of GST-RAC3 fusion proteins, in total comprising the full-length RAC3 (Fig.1 A), and probed these fusions with [35S]methionine-labeled VDR and ERβ in a Far Western assay. The VDR, as expected, interacted in a ligand-dependent manner with GST-RAC3 613–752 in this assay (Fig. 1 B). It also bound GST-RAC3 723–1034, which only contained NR box iii, in a ligand-dependent manner. The VDR did not interact with any other GST-RAC3 fragment, including GST-RAC3 342–646, which contained NR box i. It also appeared that the VDR interacted more strongly with GST-RAC3 723–1034 than with GST-RAC3 613–752, suggesting a more important role for NR box iii in the RAC3-VDR interaction. However, a different pattern was evident upon repeating this assay with 35S-ERβ, for in addition to ligand-dependent interactions with GST-RAC3 613–752 and 723–1034, ERβ also bound the 342–646 fragment, which contained only NR box i (Fig. 1 C). These interactions were of approximately equal intensity. There was also a weak, ligand-independent interaction with GST-RAC3 1–407. Identical results were obtained for ERα (data not shown). A Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gel of the GST-RAC3 fusion protein confirmed the identity of each GST-RAC3 fusion protein and approximately equal protein concentrations in each lane (data not shown). Thus, the VDR and ERβ display different binding patterns for RAC3 fragments, with the VDR interacting preferentially with regions containing NR box iii and the ERβ interacting equally well with regions containing any of the three NR boxes and the N-terminal basic helix-loop-helix-PAS domain. We then wanted to investigate the relative importance of individual NR boxes within the RAC3-RID in mediating the interactions between RAC3 and the VDR or ERβ. Peptides were synthesized corresponding to NR boxes i, ii, and iii, which were incubated with 35S-labeled receptor and 1 μmligand before probing the GST-RAC3 613–752 fragment in the Far Western assay. With the VDR, peptides corresponding to the second and third LXXLL motif were able to compete away the RAC3-RID interaction with VDR in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). Upon quantifying the data, it was evident that peptide iii was a more potent inhibitor than peptide ii, whereas the peptide comprising NR box i had little, if any, effect on the VDR-RID interaction (Fig. 2 B). A control experiment demonstrated that the effects of these peptides were specific, for a random peptide did not alter the interaction between the 35S-VDR and GST-RAC3-RID (Fig. 2 C). We again identified a different pattern when the same experiment was done with the ERβ (Fig. 2 D). Here, all three peptides were able to compete efficiently for ERβ binding with the RAC3-RID, with peptide ii being the most potent (Fig. 2 E). Thus, these data reveal receptor-specific preferences for interactions between RAC3 and different nuclear receptors, for the VDR and ERβ have different affinities for the NR boxes of RAC3. To assess the integrity of the LXXLL motif in mediating the interaction between the RAC3-RID and nuclear receptors, we used site-directed mutagenesis to switch the leucine residues of each motif to alanines (Fig.3 A). The mutants were made using the GST-RAC3-RID fusion as the template and tested for their ability to interact with the VDR or ERβ in GST pull-down assays. The wild-type RAC3-RID was able to pull down a significant amount of35S-VDR in the presence of 1 μm vitamin D (Fig. 3 B). This interaction was specific, for GST alone pulled down much less 35S-VDR. Mutations in NR boxes i or ii displayed wild-type binding. However, when NR box iii was mutated, the RID-VDR interaction was greatly reduced to a level only slightly higher than background binding to GST alone. GST-RAC3 342–646, which contained only NR box i, also had minimal binding to the VDR, consistent with the Far Western assay (Fig. 1 B). Equal protein concentrations of each GST fusion confirmed the specificity of these findings. Thus, these data support the above observations in implicating NR box iii as being most critical to RAC3 interaction with the VDR. The wild-type RID was also able to pull down significant amounts of35S-ERβ in the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 3 C). In contrast to the VDR, an alanine substitution for leucine in any of the three NR boxes weakened the interaction of the RAC3-RID with ERβ, with the mutation of NR box ii being the most deleterious, again supporting the results of LXXLL peptide competition experiments (Fig. 2 B). However, with each mutation, significant binding above background between the RAC3-RID and35S-ERβ was still observed. Furthermore, the GST-RAC3 342–646 fragment, with only NR box i, was able to interact efficiently with ERβ (Fig. 3 C) as in the Far Western assay (Fig.1 C). These data suggest that although all three motifs are capable of interacting with ERβ separately, none of them is absolutely required for the interaction. In contrast, NR box iii of RAC3 appears to be essential for the interaction with the VDR. The above data provide compelling evidence that the VDR interacts specifically with RAC3 in solution via the LXXLL motifs of the RAC3 RID, particularly NR box iii. To gain further insight into the function of NR boxes in coactivator-VDR interactions on a heterodimeric complex bound to DNA, we performed gel-shift assays with VDR/RXR heterodimers on a DR3 element in the presence of wild-type or mutant RAC3-RID (Fig. 4). The VDR/RXR heterodimer bound strongly to the 32P-labeled DR3 probe and was unaffected by the addition of GST alone (Fig. 4 A,lanes 1 and 2). The addition of the RAC3-RID resulted in a ligand-dependent shift of the heterodimeric complex to a slower-migrating form (arrow, lanes 3 and 4). The mutation of NR box i had little effect on the ability of the RID to shift the complex (lane 5). However, mutating NR box ii diminished the formation of the RID-VDR/RXR complex, whereas mutating NR box iii nearly abolished the formation completely (lanes 6 and 7). Consistently, GST-RAC3 342–646, with only NR box i, was unable to shift the VDR/RXR complex (lane 8). These results differ slightly from the GST pull down, in which only the NR box iii mutation inhibited interaction with VDR alone (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that both motifs ii and iii may contribute to the interaction with DNA-bound VDR/RXR heterodimer. We next analyzed the involvement of nuclear receptor AF-2 domains in regulating the interaction between the RAC3-RID and the VDR/RXR heterodimer (Fig. 4 B). Using the gel-shift assay, we compared the ability of the RID to bind the wild-type heterodimerversus the VDR/RXR443 and VDR402/RXR heterodimers, in which the AF-2 domain of RXR or VDR had been deleted, respectively. As demonstrated above, the RID was able to bind the DNA-bound, wild-type VDR/RXR complex (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). Deletion of the VDR AF-2 domain did not affect the formation of the heterodimer-DNA complex but resulted in the loss of the RID-shifted complex (lane 4). This suggests that the VDR AF-2 domain is required for interaction of RAC3 with the heterodimer and that RXR AF-2 domain alone is not sufficient for the interaction. Interestingly, deletion of the RXR AF-2 domain resulted in a much stronger shift of the heterodimeric complex by the RAC3-RID (lane 6) without affecting heterodimer formation (lane 5), suggesting that the RXR AF-2 domain can inhibit the interaction between RAC3 and VDR/RXR. The strong interaction was abolished upon deletion of the VDR AF-2 domain (lane 8), further supporting a requirement of VDR AF-2 helix 12 for RAC3 binding to the DNA-bound heterodimer. Finally, we compared the RAC3 NR box preferences of VDR/RXRversus VDR/RXR443 (Fig. 4 C). Intriguingly, the VDR/RXR443 heterodimer displayed different NR box preferences. Mutation of NR box i or iii greatly reduced the shift by the RAC3-RID (Fig.4 C, lanes 3 and 5), whereas mutation of NR box ii only slightly weakened the binding (lane 4). Thus deletion of the RXR AF-2 domain resulted in a switch in the NR box requirements, with NR boxes i and iii being most important for VDR/RXR443 compared with NR boxes ii and iii for VDR/RXR. An autoradiograph confirmed equal expression levels of each35S-labeled receptor (Fig. 4 D). This finding supports the hypothesis that multiple LXXLL motifs provide RAC3 with the flexibility to adapt to different configurations of a nuclear receptor dimer. RAC3 has previously been shown to enhance the transcriptional activity of the RAR and progesterone receptor (37.Li H. Gomes P.J. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8479-8484Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). However, its effect on VDR and ERβ function in vivo has not been demonstrated. To address this, we performed transient transfection assays in HEK293 and CV-1 cells using luciferase reporters harboring either two copies of the vitamin D response element of the osteopontin gene for VDR studies or a consensus ERE element for ERβ studies (Fig. 5). Transfection of the VDR into CV-1 cells minimally activated the vitamin D response element driven reporter (Fig. 5 A). However, treating t"
https://openalex.org/W1984484006,"The protozoan Leishmania donovani has a myo-inositol/proton symporter (MIT) that is a member of a large sugar transporter superfamily. Active transport by MIT is driven by the proton electrochemical gradient across the parasite membrane, and MIT is a prototype for understanding the function of an active transporter in lower eukaryotes. MIT contains two duplicated 6- or 7-amino acid motifs within cytoplasmic loops, which are highly conserved among 50 members of the sugar transporter superfamily and are designated A1, A2((V)(D/E)(R/K)ΦGR(R/K)), and B1 (PESPRΦL), B2 (VPETKG). In particular, the three acidic residues within these motifs, Glu187(B1), Asp300(A2), and Glu429(B2) in MIT, are highly conserved with 96, 78, and 96% amino acid identity within the analyzed members of this transporter superfamily ranging from bacteria, archaea, and fungi to plants and the animal kingdom. We have used site-directed mutagenesis in combination with functional expression of transporter mutants in Xenopus oocytes and overexpression inLeishmania transfectants to investigate the significance of these three acidic residues in the B1, A2, and B2 motifs. Alteration to the uncharged amides greatly reduced MIT transport function to 23% (E187Q), 1.4% (D300N), and 3% (E429Q) of wild-type activity, respectively, by affectingV max but not substrate affinity. Conservative mutations that retained the charge revealed a less pronounced effect on inositol transport with 39% (E187D), 16% (D300E) and 20% (E429D) remaining transport activity. Immunofluorescence microscopy of oocyte cryosections confirmed that MIT mutants were expressed on the oocyte surface in similar quantity to MIT wild type. The proton uncouplers carbonylcyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone and dinitrophenol inhibited inositol transport by 50–70% in the wild type as well as in E187Q, D300N, and E429Q, despite their reduced transport activities, suggesting that transport in these mutants is still proton-coupled. Furthermore, temperature-dependent uptake studies showed an increased Arrhenius activation energy for the B1-E187Q and the B2-E429Q mutants, which supports the idea of an impaired transporter cycle in these mutants. We conclude that the conserved acidic residues Glu187, Asp300, and Glu429 are critical for transport function of MIT."

(1998) J. Biol. Chem.273, 28305–28313). However, a recent study also demonstrated the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in this process. In the present study, we investigated the role of PKC and PI3K in Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation. Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation was inhibited by 90% by a PKC inhibitor, calphostin C, and 50% by a PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin. Ox-LDL-induced expression of GM-CSF and its subsequent release were inhibited by calphostin C but not by wortmannin, whereas recombinant GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation was inhibited by wortmannin by 50% but not by calphostin C. Ox-LDL activated PI3K at two time points (10 min and 4 h), and the activation at the second but not first point was significantly inhibited by calphostin C and anti-GM-CSF antibody. Our results suggest that PKC plays a role upstream in the signaling pathway to GM-CSF induction, whereas PI3K is involved, at least in part, downstream in the signaling pathway after GM-CSF induction. Oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) can induce macrophage proliferation in vitro. To explore the mechanisms involved in this process, we reported that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in its signaling pathway (Matsumura, T., Sakai, M., Kobori, S., Biwa, T., Takemura, T., Matsuda, H., Hakamata, H., Horiuchi, S., and Shichiri, M.

Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9988) Google Scholar). Macrophages take up oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL)1 through the scavenger receptor pathways and transform into foam cells in vitro (2.Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Foam cells producing various bioactive molecules, such as cytokines and growth factors, are believed to play an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis (1.Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9988) Google Scholar). One of the characteristic events in the atherosclerotic lesion is the proliferation of cellular components of arterial walls. In addition to the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells (1.Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9988) Google Scholar), several reports emphasize the presence of macrophages and macrophage-derived proliferating foam cells in the early stages of human and rabbit atherosclerotic lesions (3.Gordon D.

Since macrophage-derived foam cells play an important role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions (1.Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9988) Google Scholar), it is possible that macrophage proliferation may modulate the progression of atherosclerosis. Thus, clarification of the mechanism of macrophage activation, proliferation, and survival process is expected to enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In this regard, our recent study revealed that Ox-LDL can induce a rise in intracellular calcium concentration and activate protein kinase C (PKC) in mouse peritoneal macrophages (13.Matsumura T. Sakai M. Kobori S. Biwa T. Takemura T. Matsuda H. Hakamata H. Horiuchi S. Shichiri M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that activation of PKC leads to release into the culture medium of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which plays a priming role in the Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation (14.Biwa T.

In a recent study using human macrophage-derived cells (THP-1 cells) and mouse peritoneal macrophages, however, Martens et al. (12.Martens J.S. Reiner N.E. Herrera-Velit P. Steinbrecher U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4915-4920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) provided evidence that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is also involved in the Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation. The present study was undertaken to determine the relationship between PI3K and PKC on one hand and induction of GM-CSF on the other, in the signaling pathway for Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation. [3H]Thymidine (80 Ci/mmol) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for determination of mouse GM-CSF levels were purchased from Amersham Life Science (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Calphostin C and wortmannin were purchased from Sigma and stored at −20 °C as stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The final concentrations of Me2SO were < 0.1% in the culture medium. At this concentration, Me2SO did not affect cell viability and macrophage proliferation. Calphostin C at <500 nm and wortmannin at <100 nm did not show any cytotoxic effect, as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Other chemicals were of the highest grade available from commercial sources. Human LDL (d = 1.019 to 1.063 g/ml) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation from the plasma of consented normolipidemic subjects after overnight fasting (15.Miyazaki A. Sakai M. Suginohara Y. Hakamata H. Sakamoto Y. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (approved by the Human Ethics Review Committee of our institution). LDL was dialyzed against 0.15m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). Ox-LDL was prepared by incubation of 0.1 mg/ml LDL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 5 μm CuSO4 for 20 h, followed by the addition of 1 mm EDTA and cooling on ice (16.Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Sakamoto Y. Horiuchi S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) using BSA as a standard, and were expressed in milligrams of protein/ml (17.Miyazaki A. Rahim A.T.M.A. Araki S. Morino Y. Horiuchi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1082: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The levels of endotoxin associated with these lipoproteins were <1 pg/μg of protein, which were measured by a commercially available kit (Toxicolor system, Seikagaku Corp.). Moreover, macrophage proliferation was not affected by endotoxin at a concentration <1 ng/ml in our experimental system. Peritoneal macrophages were collected from anesthetized male C3H/He mice (25–30 g) by peritoneal lavage with 8 ml of ice-cold PBS, centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Seiyaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml) (medium A) (18.Hakamata H. Miyazaki A. Sakai M. Suginohara Y. Sakamoto Y. Horiuchi S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1860-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of our institution. Cell suspensions were dispersed in each well of appropriate tissue culture plates and incubated for 90 min in medium A. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing three times with prewarmed medium A. After washing, cell number decreased to ∼80%. More than 98% of adherent cells were considered to be macrophages based on four criteria, including (i) adherence to culture plates, (ii) morphological features resembling mononuclear cells after Giemsa staining, (iii) the capacity to take up carbon particles, and (iv) positive immunohistochemistry with antibody for CD 68 (6.Yui S. Sasaki T. Miyzaki A. Horiuchi S. Yamazaki M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19.Moore K.J. Fabunmi R.P. Andersson L.P. Freeman M.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The cells were >95% viable as determined by trypan blue staining and lactic dehydrogenase release. Unless otherwise specified, all cellular experiments were performed at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Peritoneal cells were adjusted to 5 × 104 cells/ml, and 1 ml of cell suspensions in medium A were dispersed in each well of 24-well tissue culture plates (15.5 mm in diameter, Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) and incubated for 90 min. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing three times with 1 ml of medium A. Macrophage monolayers thus formed were cultured with 1 ml of medium A in the presence of the lipoproteins to be tested. For thymidine incorporation assay, 18 h before the termination of the experiments, 20 μl of 50 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added to each well and incubated for 18 h. After discarding the medium, each well was washed three times with 1 ml of PBS and the cells were lysed with 0.5 ml of 0.5 m NaOH by incubation on ice for 10 min. Cell lysates were neutralized with 0.25 ml of 1m HCl, further precipitated with 0.25 ml of 40% trichloroacetic acid by incubation on ice for 20 min. The resulting trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was collected on filters (Millipore PVDF filter; 0.45-μm pore size) and washed three times with 1 ml of 99.5% ethanol. Filters were dried under air, and their radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter (14.Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28305-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Macrophage monolayers were incubated in 1 ml of medium A with the lipoproteins to be tested. After incubation for 7 days, cells were lysed in 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and naphthol blue-black-stained nuclei were counted in a hemocytometer as described previously (14.Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28305-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Macrophage monolayers (5 × 106 cells/plate, 10 cm in diameter, Falcon) were cultured in 15 ml of medium A with or without the lipoproteins to be tested for indicated times, and then 300 μl of the medium were collected. The concentration of GM-CSF protein was determined according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer of mouse GM-CSF-specific ELISA system (sensitivity, 5 pg/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using recombinant murine GM-CSF as a standard (14.Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28305-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). After incubation of murine peritoneal macrophage monolayers (2 × 106 cells/well in six-well plate, 3.5 cm in diameter, Nunc) in medium A with 40 μg/ml Ox-LDL for 1 h, total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc). The first strand cDNA synthesis containing 1 μg of total RNA was primed with oligo(dT). Primers used for PCR amplification of GM-CSF and β-actin were designed on the basis of murine GM-CSF cDNA (20.Miyatake S. Otsuka T. Yokota T. Lee F. Arai K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2561-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and murine β-actin cDNA (21.Alonso S. Minty A. Bourlet Y. Bruckingham M. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 23: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). PCR was performed as described previously (14.Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28305-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The sizes of RT-PCR products of GM-CSF and β-actin were expected to be 368 and 540 base pairs, respectively. To verify that the amplification products were consistent with the reported sequences of murine GM-CSF and β-actin, they were ligated into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI), transfected into Escherichia coliXL1-Blue and sequenced by using 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PKC activity in macrophages was assayed by MESACUP protein kinase assay kit (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan). Macrophages (1 × 107 cells/plate, 10 cm in diameter, Falcon) in 10 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium with 3% BSA were treated with 40 μg/ml lipoproteins for indicated times. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and detached from the plates with a rubber policeman. Cells were suspended in 1 ml of sample preparation buffer (5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and sonicated for 30 s at 4 °C by Sonifier (Branson Sonic Power Co.). Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and precipitates were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer and used as the membrane fractions. The PKC activity in these fractions was measured as described previously (13.Matsumura T. Sakai M. Kobori S. Biwa T. Takemura T. Matsuda H. Hakamata H. Horiuchi S. Shichiri M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). PI3K activity in macrophages was determined as described previously (22.Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Briefly, macrophages (1 × 107 cells, 10 cm in diameter, Falcon) in 10 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium with 3% BSA were treated with 40 μg/ml lipoproteins in the presence or absence of calphostin C for indicated times. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold Hanks' buffered saline and incubated with lysis solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 137 mm NaCl, 10% Triton X-100 (v/v), 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm molybdate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants of cell lysates each containing 300 μg of protein were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal antibody to p85 (anti-rat PI3K antibody, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Immune complexes were collected on protein A-agarose beads, washed three times with lysis solution containing 50 μm vanadate, and three times with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 100 μl of 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, on ice. To determine PI3K activity, 20 μg of phosphatidylinositol was added to immunoprecipitates, followed by 30 μl of buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 200 μm adenosine, and 50 μm ATP. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.1 ml of 1 m HCl and 0.2 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v). Lipids were separated on thin layer chromatography using a solvent of chloroform:methanol:water:28% ammonia (18:14:3:2, v/v/v/v). To quantify PI3K activity, the amount of labeled PI 3-phosphate was analyzed using a Bio Image Analyzer, BAS 2000 system (Fuji Film Co.). Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences between groups were compared for statistical significance using Student's t test. A probability value less than 5% was considered significant. We first compared calphostin C as a PKC inhibitor and wortmannin as a PI3K inhibitor for their effects on the Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation. Ox-LDL-induced thymidine incorporation into macrophages was significantly inhibited by calphostin C in a dose-dependent manner; the extent of inhibition was 90% at 250 nm (Fig.1 A). Under identical conditions, macrophage proliferation was also inhibited by wortmannin in a dose-dependent manner and a plateau level was achieved at 50 nm (Fig. 1 B). The extent of inhibition of thymidine incorporation by wortmannin was 50% (Fig. 1 B), which is essentially consistent with that reported by Martens et al. (12.Martens J.S. Reiner N.E. Herrera-Velit P. Steinbrecher U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4915-4920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). When macrophage proliferation was determined by the cell-counting assay, Ox-LDL-induced increase in cell number (from 3.52 × 104/well to 7.24 × 104/well) was inhibited by 84% by calphostin C and by 55% by wortmannin (TableI), as was observed with the thymidine incorporation assay. Although the extent of inhibition by wortmannin was weaker than that by calphostin C, it is clear that both PKC and PI3K play a key role in Ox-LDL-induced signaling pathway for macrophage proliferation.Table IEffect of calphostin C and wortmannin on Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferationSampleCell no.× 10−4/wellMedium alone3.52 ± 0.52 (100%)Wortmannin (50 nm)3.57 ± 0.33 (101%)Calphostin C (250 nm)3.61 ± 0.46 (103%)Ox-LDL (40 μg/ml)7.24 ± 0.82 (206%)§Ox-LDL + wortmannin5.23 ± 0.50 (149%)#Ox-LDL + calphostin C4.12 ± 0.66 (117%)†Peritoneal macrophages from C3H/He mice (5 × 104cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates) were incubated for 7 days in medium A with 40 μg/ml Ox-LDL in the presence of 50 nmwortmannin or 250 nm calphostin C.

We have previously shown that the induction of GM-CSF and its release into the culture medium are important processes in Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation, suggesting that GM-CSF acts as a growth priming factor in this phenomenon (14.Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28305-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of calphostin C and wortmannin on Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF expression. Incubation of cells with the medium alone was not associated with GM-CSF mRNA expression under the experimental conditions, whereas incubation with 40 μg/ml Ox-LDL resulted in the appearance of a significant band of GM-CSF mRNA (Fig.2). This band was significantly reduced by coincubation with calphostin C, while coincubation with wortmannin had no effect (Fig. 2). We next compared the effects of calphostin C and wortmannin on Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF release into the culture medium by using ELISA specific for mouse GM-CSF. As shown in Fig.3 A, macrophages spontaneously released GM-CSF into the medium at a concentration of 0.15 pm. Incubation of macrophages with 40 μg/ml LDL resulted in a slight increase in GM-CSF release into the culture medium, but its concentration returned to basal level at 24 h (Fig.3 A). In contrast, when cells were incubated with the same concentration of Ox-LDL, the concentration of GM-CSF in the culture medium markedly increased and reached a peak level at 4 h, followed by a gradual decrease to the basal level at 24 h (Fig.3 A). When cells were incubated for 4 h with Ox-LDL together with 250 nm calphostin C or 50 nmwortmannin, Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF secretion was inhibited by 70% by calphostin C, whereas wortmannin had no effect (Fig. 3 B), as was the case with GM-CSF expression (Fig. 2). The above results indicated that both calphostin C and wortmannin significantly inhibited macrophage proliferation (Fig. 1 and Table I), whereas only calphostin C effectively inhibited GM-CSF expression (Fig. 2) as well as GM-CSF release into the medium (Fig. 3). Thus, it seems relevant to assume that the principal site of action of PKC is upstream in the signaling pathway for GM-CSF expression, but that of PI3K is downstream in the signaling pathway after GM-CSF expression, or a signaling pathway unrelated to GM-CSF.Figure 3Effect of calphostin C and wortmannin on Ox-LDL induced GM-CSF secretion from macrophages. A, peritoneal macrophages (5 × 106) in a 10-cm dish were incubated in 15 ml of medium A in the presence of 40 μg/ml Ox-LDL (●) or 40 μg/ml LDL (○) for indicated times. B, peritoneal macrophages (5 × 106) were incubated with medium A alone (A), 50 nm wortmannin (B), 250 nm calphostin C (C), 40 μg/ml Ox-LDL (D), 40 μg/ml Ox-LDL with 50 nmwortmannin (E) or 40 μg/ml Ox-LDL with 250 nmcalphostin C (F). Aliquots (300 μl) of the culture medium were taken at 4 h after incubation with Ox-LDL. The supernatants were obtained by brief centrifugation, and the level of GM-CSF was determined by mouse GM-CSF-specific ELISA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using Student'st test. #, p < 0.05, compared with the control. +, p < 0.05, compared with cells incubated with Ox-LDL alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to test our notion that PI3K might be involved in the signaling pathway after GM-CSF release, we examined the effect of wortmannin on macrophage proliferation induced by recombinant GM-CSF. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the inhibitory effect of calphostin C on recombinant GM-CSF-induced thymidine incorporation into macrophages was negligible (up to 250 nm) or very small (15% inhibition at 500 nm) (Fig. 4 A). In sharp contrast, GM-CSF-induced thymidine incorporation into macrophages was significantly inhibited by wortmannin in a dose-dependent fashion, although the extent of inhibition was incomplete, amounting to 45% at 50 nmwortmannin. The cell-counting assay also showed that macrophage proliferation induced by recombinant GM-CSF was significantly inhibited by 52% by wortmannin, but not by calphostin C (TableII). These results suggested that PI3K acts, at least in part, after GM-CSF release in the signaling pathway of macrophage proliferation.Table IIEffect of calphostin C and wortmannin on recombinant GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferationSampleCell no.× 10−4/wellMedium alone4.28 ± 0.19 (100%)Wortmannin (50 nm)4.31 ± 0.21 (101%)Calphostin C (250 nm)4.29 ± 0.23 (100%)GM-CSF (5 nm)13.62 ± 0.83 (318%)§GM-CSF + wortmannin8.76 ± 0.82 (205%)#GM-CSF + calphostin C12.16 ± 0.62 (280%)Peritoneal macrophages (5 × 104 cells/well) were incubated for 5 days in medium A with 5 nm GM-CSF in the presence of 50 nm wortmannin or 250 nmcalphostin C.

We finally compared the serial changes in PKC and PI3K activities of peritoneal macrophages during incubation with Ox-LDL or LDL. Incubation of macrophages with LDL did not change the membrane PKC activity. However, incubation of cells with Ox-LDL resulted in a rapid activation of PKC, reaching a peak level at 15 min after the addition of Ox-LDL (Fig.5 A). PI3K activity was similarly increased 1.7-fold by Ox-LDL at 10 min followed by a rapid decline to the basal level (Fig. 5 B). In contrast to PKC activity, however, PI3K activity gradually increased again to 2.3-fold above the basal level, with a second peak at 4 h after the addition of Ox-LDL (Fig. 5 B). Incubation with LDL did not change PI3K activity in these macrophages (data not shown). These results indicate that Ox-LDL-induced activation of PI3K occurs at two time points, 10 min and 4 h after the addition of Ox-LDL to the culture medium. In order to specify which time point is most important for Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation, we determined the effects of calphostin C and anti-GM-CSF antibody on Ox-LDL-induced PI3K activation. As shown in Fig. 6, Ox-LDL-induced PI3K activation at 10 min was not affected by anti-mouse GM-CSF antibody and calphostin C, whereas PI3K activation at 4 h after the addition of Ox-LDL was significantly inhibited (by 70%) not only by calphostin C but also by an anti-mouse GM-CSF antibody (Fig.6). These results strengthened our contention that PI3K is functional, at least in part, after PKC-mediated GM-CSF expression.Figure 6Effect of calphosti"

Herpes simplex virus type 1 origin binding protein infected cell protein 8 adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) single-strand binding protein human Herpes virus Initiation of replication of viral and cellular chromosomes involves the assembly of multienzyme complexes, replisomes, at unique locations (1.Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2 nd Ed. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, initiator proteins, identify the origins of DNA replication and facilitate the conversion of duplex DNA to single-stranded templates for DNA synthesis. The origins of DNA replication display a structural diversity between species that might reflect variations in the mechanisms by which the origins are activated and controlled. In addition, it might also be important to create diversity to ascertain that chromosomes can be uniquely identified and preferentially replicated. We have studied Herpes simplex virus type I to learn more about the molecular mechanisms that underlie initiation of DNA synthesis and subsequent events at the replication fork. HSV-11 DNA replication requires seven virally encoded proteins (2.Wu C, A. Nelson N.J. McGeoch D.J. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 435-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Boehmer P.E.

The putative viral replisome consists of a trimeric helicase-primase composed by the products of the UL5, UL8, and UL52 genes as well as a processive DNA polymerase containing the UL30 and UL42 gene products (2.Wu C, A.

Samuelsson T. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24633-24639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The two binding sites are referred to as box I and box II. A third site, box III, does not bind OBP with high affinity despite extensive sequence homology. Box I and box II are separated by a spacer sequence containing 18 alternating AT base pairs. The oriS palindrome is 46 nucleotides, and the oriL palindrome is 144 nucleotides. Mutations in boxes I, II, and III reduce DNA replication (12.Hernandez T.R. Dutch R.E. Lehman I.R. Gustafsson C. Elias P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the length of the AT-rich sequence affects DNA synthesis in a periodic fashion (13.Lockshon D. Galloway D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4018-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has also been clearly demonstrated that sequences immediately outside the minimal oriS have a profound effect on DNA replication (14.Wong S.C. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2601-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Nguyen-Huynh A.T. Schaffer PA. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3635-3645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These sequences may recruit additional trans-acting factors or affect the physical properties of DNA. HSV-1 OBP appears to bind cooperatively as two dimers to the minimal oriS (16.Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17424-17429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The interaction results in a local unwinding of DNA that can be detected using electron microscopy (19.Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). During this process unwound stem-loop structures are formed at oriS. We describe here a series of investigations that demonstrate that HSV-1 oriS can be converted to a novel conformation referred to as oriS*. We also show that a complex with a high stability can be formed between OBP and oriS*. This complex can be readily detected in agarose gels. Using mutant forms of oriS and single-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the upper strand of oriS, we have been able to identify some of the structural features that are essential for the formation of a stable complex between OBP and oriS*. On the basis of these results we discuss a possible mechanism for the activation of oriS that involves an OBP-mediated extrusion of hairpin structures. Similar mechanisms for sequence-specific loading of DNA helicases may exist also for other organisms. Restriction fragments containing oriS were derived from the pORI series (17.Gustafsson C.M.

The plasmids pCG11, pCG16, and pCG20 have TT to GG transversions in boxes I, II, and III, respectively. pCG28, pCG35, and pCG42 have the same transversions in two of the binding sites. They are identified as pCG28(−box I,−box III) and pCG42(−box I,−box II), pCG35(−box II,−box III) and pCG42(−box I,−box II). pCG40(−box I,−box II,−box III) has point mutations in all three binding sites. SphI-EcoRI fragments were labeled the 3′ end of the upper strand (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). EcoRI-HindIII fragments were labeled the 3′ end of the lower strand.

The restriction fragments were isolated by gel electrophoresis in agarose gels and transferred to DEAE membranes. The DNA fragments were eluted in a buffer containing 1 m NaCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. They were labeled either at the EcoRI site using [α-32P]dATP or at the HindIII site using [α-32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol). The oligonucleotides used were as follows: PE17, 5′-GATCTGCGAAGCGTTCGCACTTCGTCCCAATG-3′; PE18, 5′-GATCCATTGGGACGAAGTGCGAACGCTTCGCA-3′; PE45, 5′-GATCTAAAAGAAGTGAGAACGCG-3′; PE46, 5′-GCTTCGCGTTCTCACTTCTTTTA-3′; PE146, 5′-CGGGCACGGCGCCAG-3′; oriS136, 5′-CTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCGGGTAAAAGAAGTGAGAACGCGAAGCGTTCGCACTTCGTCCCAATATATATATATTATTAGGGCGAAGTGCGAGCACTGGCGCCGTGCCCGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCG-3′; oriS93, 5′-CGCGAAGCGTTCGCACTTCGTCCCAATATATATATATTATTAGGGCGAAGTGCGAGCACTGGCGCCGTGCCCGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCG-3′; oriS108, 5′-CTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCGGGTAAAAGAAGTGAGAACGCGAAGCGTTCGCACTTCGTCCCAATATATATATATTATTAGGGCGAAGTGCGAGCACTGGCGC-3′; oriS80, 5′-AAAAGAAGTGAGAACGCGAAGCGTTCGCACTTCGTCCCAATATATATATATTATTAGGGCGAAGTGCGAGCACTGGCGC-3′; and oriS80 poly(dT), 5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAGCGTTCGCACTTCGTCCCAATATATATATATTATTAGGGCGAAGTGCGAGCACTGGCGCC-3′. Escherichia coli SSB was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. OBP and ICP8 were purified to near homogeneity from Sf9 cells using recombinant baculovirus vectors obtained from Dr. N. D. Stow (Medical Research Council Virology Unit, Glasgow, UK) essentially as described (8.Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). The reaction mixture (5 μl) contained 0.2 nm of radiolabeled restriction fragment containing oriS, 50 mm NaCl, and 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. It was heated at 95 °C in a programmable thermo controller (MJ Research, Inc.) for 5 min and cooled directly on ice. The reaction mixture contained 0.5 nm oriS or oriS* and 1 μg of heat-denatured calf thymus DNA in 50 mm CH3COONa, pH 4.5, 280 mm NaCl, and 4.5 mm ZnSO4. S1 nuclease (Promega) was added to a final concentration of 0.003 units/μl in a total volume of 400 μl. The samples were incubated 3 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate. DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and dissolved in 4 μl of water. The samples were analyzed on a 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. DNA sequencing was performed using the Thermo Sequenase kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Standard G+A cleavage reactions were performed as described (22.Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., More, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1995) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Section 7.5.4, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). The reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 0.1 nm end-labeled oriS or oriS*, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm ATPγS, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm NaCl, and the indicated amounts of OBP and ICP8. The incubation was at 37 °C for 10 min. Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed on 1% agarose gels in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, and 1 mmEDTA. The submarine gels were run at 7 V/cm at room temperature for 2.5 h. The gels were dried on DE81 paper (Whatman). They were the autoradiographed overnight at −80 °C or subjected to PhosphorImager analysis. The origin binding protein of Herpes simplex virus binds in a sequence-specific manner to two sites in the viral origin of DNA replication referred to as box I and box II (Fig.1). The two sites are separated by an AT-rich spacer sequence. A series of plasmids was made in which mutations were introduced into the AT-rich spacer sequence of oriS (17.Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). They were either additions or deletions of AT dinucleotides. The mutations had opposite effects on DNA replication and the cooperative binding of OBP to oriS. For example, the deletion of 6 AT base pairs from the spacer sequence as in oriS(−6 AT) completely inhibited DNA replication but strongly stimulated cooperative binding of OBP to oriS (17.Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We suggested that the ATP-dependent cooperative binding of OBP to oriS might induce a conformational change in DNA, thereby facilitating the initiation of DNA replication (17.Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The nature of this structural change has remained elusive. We have now found that heat-induced denaturation of a 140-base pair restriction fragment containing oriS gives rise to a novel conformation of that DNA referred to as oriS* (Fig.2). oriS* was only produced quantitatively at low DNA concentrations, arguing that intramolecular base pairing prevents reannealing of the complementary single strand (results not shown). The new DNA species migrated slower than the corresponding linear duplex DNA in agarose gels (Fig. 2). The binding of OBP to oriS(wt) and oriS(6−AT) as well as oriS*(wt) and oriS*(6−AT) were then examined (Fig. 2). We found that OBP bound more efficiently to oriS(6−AT) than to oriS(wt) in agreement with previous results (17.Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast, OBP bound oriS*(wt) more efficiently than oriS*(6−AT). Apparently mutations in the AT-rich spacer sequence that reduce DNA replication also reduce the ability to form an OBP-oriS* complex. Our result suggests that oriS* may serve as an intermediate during the initiation of HSV-1 DNA replication. To characterize the OBP-oriS* complex we performed an experiment to determine the half-life of the complex (Fig. 3). Previous experiments have shown that a complex between OBP and a duplex oligonucleotide containing box I has a half-life of 34 s at 22 °C (23.Elias P. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2959-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A preformed OBP-oriS* complex was now challenged with a 1000-fold excess of the unlabeled duplex oligonucleotide, PE17/18, containing box I. The time of challenge varied between 0 and 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were then immediately examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. We found that the OBP-oriS* complex was remarkably stable (Fig. 3, A and C). The half-life of the OBP-oriS* complex was determined from several independent experiments to be approximately 20 min at 37 °C (results not shown). In contrast, complexes between OBP and oriS dissociated immediately after the addition of the competing duplex oligonucleotide (Fig. 3,B and C). This finding implies that additional sequences and novel structures present in oriS* stabilize the complex. The structure of oriS* was first examined by S1 nuclease digestion. This experiment demonstrated that the AT-rich spacer sequence was readily accessible to the nuclease (Fig.4 A). The sequences at either side of the spacer were resistant to cleavage by S1. This finding indicated that a hairpin was formed at the site of the oriS palindrome. The sequences surrounding the putative hairpin were moderately accessible to S1, indicating that they adopt a partially single-stranded conformation. We could also show that oriS* but not oriS was bound by the HSV-1 encoded single-stranded DNA-binding protein ICP8 as well as E. coli SSB (Fig. 4, B andC). A single-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the upper strand of oriS, oriS136, was synthesized. It behaved as oriS* in agarose gels and in the binding experiments further discussed below. We have used this oligonucleotide to perform DNA melting experiments. These experiments showed that oriS136 underwent a structural transition characterized by a sharp increase in hyperchromicity with a T m of 65 °C in 0.1 m NaCl (results not shown). In summary, oriS* appears to consist of a stable hairpin with the AT-rich spacer sequence in the loop. The stem contains complementary sequences from box I and box II. It may constitute a double-stranded binding site for the HSV-1 origin binding protein. The hairpin is surrounded by 5′ and 3′ tails. They appear to be partially single-stranded DNA inasmuch as they provide binding sites for single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. Further insight into the structural requirements for the formation of an OBP-oriS* complex was obtained when we investigated the ability of OBP to bind to oriS* formed by the upper and lower strands of oriS. We noted that OBP bound preferentially to oriS* formed by the upper strand (Fig.5). This finding argues that the OBP-oriS* complex consists of one OBP dimer bound to only one of the two available strands formed by heat denaturation of oriS. It also implies that there are important structural differences between oriS* formed by the upper strand and oriS* formed by the lower strand. The importance of structures outside the oriS* palindrome was further investigated using synthetic single-stranded oligonucleotides. They were as follows: oriS136 corresponds to oriS* formed by the upper strand of the Sph/EcRI fragment from pORI(wt); oriS93 is devoid of the 5′ part of oriS*; oriS108 is missing the 3′ part of oriS*; oriS80 has a short 5′ sequence and no 3′ part; oriS80dT has a 5′ part made up of poly(dT). The radiolabeled oligonucleotides were incubated with OBP, and the reaction mixtures were analyzed on agarose gels (Fig.6). The results show that oriS* formed by heat denaturation of duplex DNA, oriS136, and oriS108 all supported the formation of OBP-DNA complexes of similar mobilities. oriS93 did not support the formation of a complex with OBP. The results suggest that sequences on the 5′ side of the oriS palindrome but not on the 3′ side of the oriS palindrome are essential for the formation of a stable complex with OBP. To further investigate the role of the 5′ end we have carried out an experiment in which increasing amounts of OBP were added to the radiolabeled oligonucleotides oriS80 and oriS80poly(dT). The amount of complex formed was measured after agarose gel electrophoresis using a PhosphorImager. oriS80 supported the formation of a complex with OBP as efficiently as oriS136. oriS80poly(dT) did not form a stable complex with OBP (results not shown). This result indicates that there exist specific recognition elements in oriS80 that are absent in oriS80poly(dT). It strongly suggests that nucleotide sequence and secondary structure of the 5′ part of oriS* contribute significantly to the stability of the OBP-oriS* complex. The results obtained using S1 nuclease digestion of oriS* indicated that the AT-rich spacer constitutes a single-stranded loop of a hairpin in which the stem contain complementary sequences from box I and box II. The sequences upstream and downstream the central oriS palindrome hairpin may adopt a single-stranded conformation. To characterize the role of these regions we performed experiments in which oligonucleotides either co-linear or complementary to the 5′ and 3′ tails of oriS* were incubated with radiolabeled oriS* before or after the addition of OBP (Fig. 7). We found that an oligonucleotide complementary to the 5′ tail, PE 46, completely prevented the formation of a complex when added prior to OBP (Fig.7 A). A co-linear oligonucleotide, PE 45, did not affect complex formation. Similar experiments were also performed to study the role of the 3′ tail (Fig. 7 B). We found that an oligonucleotide complementary to the 3′ tail was unable to inhibit the formation of the OBP-oriS* complex. Our observations infer that the OBP interacts directly with structural elements present at the 5′ side of the oriS* hairpin. We argue that the formation of the OBP-oriS* complex requires sequence- and structure-specific interactions with the 5′ part of oriS*. Biochemical experiments have revealed the existence of two sites in oriS, box I and box II, that bind OBP in a sequence-specific way. These sites are also required for efficient DNA replication (12.Hernandez T.R. Dutch R.E. Lehman I.R. Gustafsson C. Elias P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A third site, box III, is homologous to boxes I and II. However, when box III is present in a double-stranded oligonucleotide it fails to bind OBP in a sequence-specific way (20.Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17167-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive mutational analyses have demonstrated that sequences outside boxes I and II contribute significantly to the efficiency of DNA replication (13.Lockshon D. Galloway D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4018-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14.Wong S.C. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2601-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Nguyen-Huynh A.T. Schaffer PA. J.

A biochemical understanding of the role these sequence elements play during the initiation of DNA replication is lacking. We have now examined how mutations in boxes I, II, and III affect the formation of the OBP-oriS* complex (Fig.8). The mutations were all TT to GG transversions in the recognition sequence, GTTCGCAC, for OBP. Restriction fragments containing wild type and mutant forms of oriS were heat-treated, and the products were analyzed on agarose gels (Fig. 8). They were all shown to give rise to a DNA species that migrated as oriS* in agarose gels. Their ability to bind OBP was also examined. We found that oriS*(−box I) had a reduced ability to bind OBP. oriS*(−box II) showed normal levels of complex formation. The double mutant oriS*(−box I,−box II) did not support the formation of an OBP-oriS* complex. We also found that TT to GG transversions in box III alone completely prevented the formation of an OBP-oriS* complex. Surprisingly, the ability to form an OBP-oriS* complex was restored in the double mutant oriS(−box I,−box III). A different double mutant oriS(−box II,−box III) did not give rise to an OBP-oriS* complex. The finding that OBP binds oriS*(−box I,−box III) indicates that sequences in box I and box III might interact. The point mutations that are introduced may therefore not only change the recognition sequence for OBP in the stem of the oriS* hairpin, but they may also change the conformation of the 5′ tail of oriS*. To investigate the influence of the mutations in boxes I, II, and III on the structure of oriS*, we performed a series of S1 nuclease digestion experiments (Fig.9). We found that oriS* (wt), oriS*(−box I), oriS*(−box III), and oriS*(−box I,−box III) were all sensitive to the S1 nuclease in the AT-rich spacer sequence, suggesting that they adopted similar hairpin structures. We noted, however, that the electrophoretic mobilities of the full-length fragments varied, suggesting the existence of a stable secondary structure in the box III region of oriS*. We further investigated this phenomenon by subjecting the same oriS variants labeled at the 3′ end of the upper strand to depurination by formic acid followed by cleavage induced by piperidine. The samples were analyzed on sequencing gels (Fig.10 A). The results show that the electrophoretic mobilities of the cleavage products from oriS* (wt), oriS*(−box I), oriS*(−box III), and oriS*(−box I,−box III) were identical for fragments containing box II, the AT-rich sequence, and box I. In contrast, long fragments that contained sequences from the box III region behaved anomalously (indicated by thearrow in Fig. 10 A). Fragments from oriS(wt) and oriS(−box I,−box III) had similar electrophoretic mobilities. In contrast, the corresponding long fragments obtained from oriS(−box I) and oriS(−box III) migrated differently. DNA sequencing with the upper strand as a template ensured that the unusual electrophoretic mobilities were not caused by differences in nucleotide sequence (Fig.10 B). Together our results indicate that the box III region adopts a secondary structure in oriS* that may involve direct base pairing between complementary sequences of boxes I and III.Figure 10A secondary structure revealed by anomalous electrophoretic migration.

The HSV-1 initiator protein, OBP or UL9 protein, binds specifically to oriS*, giving rise to a unique complex that by several criteria can be distinguished from the complexes that are formed between OBP and oriS. The OBP-oriS* complex has a significantly increased stability. It requires binding both to the hairpin and to sequences in the 5′ tail. The formation of the OBP-oriS* complex is influenced by mutations that affect the structure of the loop in the oriS* hairpin as well as mutations in boxes I and III of oriS. Two observations argue that the OBP-oriS* complex plays a role also in vivo. First, we have demonstrated that mutations that reduce DNA replication also inhibit the formation of the OBP-oriS* complex. Second, a study by electron microscopy has demonstrated that OBP will produce unwound stem-loop structures at oriS that look like extended versions of oriS* (19.Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In what follows we will describe a comprehensive model for the activation of HSV-1 oriS by OBP and the assembly of the HSV-1 replisome. We will also discuss the modular structure of oriS and a role for alternative DNA conformations during the activation of an origin of DNA replication. We propose that OBP binds to the linear duplex form of oriS and turns it into a structure closely resembling oriS*. In the context of the viral genome this structure would have short stretches of single-stranded DNA in the vicinity of the extruded hairpins formed by the upper and lower strands of oriS. The viral single-stranded DNA-binding protein, ICP8, may assist OBP to promote further unwinding (8.Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9.Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The single-stranded regions produced by OBP may serve as loading sites for the helicase-primase complex. This model for the initiation of HSV-1 DNA replication may be relevant for five of the eight human herpesviruses that have been identified so far. HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, HHV6, and HHV7 all have OBP homologues and the lytic origins of replication are also similar. Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalo virus, and HHV8 lack an OBP homologue, and they have to use different mechanisms for the activation the lytic replication origins. However, the enzymes acting at the replication fork are closely related for all herpesviruses. A conserved mechanism by which the replisome is assembled may therefore still exist. We will here try to define some of the sequence elements that have been demonstrated to affect the function of origins of DNA replication and discuss their role in HSV-1 oriS. Sequence-specific binding of the initiator protein may be considered foremost among the entities that build an origin of DNA replication. For example, OBP will bind to double-stranded DNA in the major groove through an interaction with the sequence GTTCGCAC (11.Simonsson S. Samuelsson T. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24633-24639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses of replication origins demonstrate, however, that DNA sequences well outside the recognition sequences for the initiator proteins are essential for DNA replication (13.Lockshon D. Galloway D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4018-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14.Wong S.C. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2601-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Nguyen-Huynh A.T. Schaffer PA. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3635-3645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Hammarsten O. Elias P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1753-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It has been argued that these sequences may be thermodynamically unstable and serve as DNA unwinding elements (25.Kowalski D. Eddy M.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4335-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). If this is true it should be possible to replace them by other DNA sequences with the similar physical properties (26.Huang R.Y. Kowalski D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4521-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The AT-rich spacer of HSV-1 oriS may serve as a DNA unwinding element. Selection experiments have, in fact, demonstrated that it can be replaced by many other AT-rich sequences (24.Hammarsten O. Elias P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1753-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It has also been noted that the phasing of structural motifs in replication origins is important. A correct phasing may be essential to allow the formation of well defined and stable nucleoprotein complexes. But it may also be needed for the initiator proteins to exert an untwisting force on DNA. Consequently, altering the phasing may affect protein-DNA interactions and DNA replication in a periodic fashion. This phenomenon is illustrated by the properties of HSV-1 oriS (13.Lockshon D. Galloway D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4018-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cooperative binding of OBP to boxes I and II as well as the replication efficiency of oriS both depend on the length of the AT-rich spacer sequence (17.Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A consequence of the results presented in this paper is that the mechanism by which mutations in origins of DNA replication affect DNA synthesis may only be fully understood in the context of an alternative DNA conformation. For example, new base pairs may be established in the alternative origin structure and mutations that destabilize this conformation will thus be expected to interfere with DNA replication. It has been observed that if the sequence TTCGTCCC located between box I and the AT-rich spacer sequence in oriS is replaced by either TTTACCCC or TTCGTTTT, DNA replication is significantly reduced but sequence-specific binding of OBP to box I is not affected (27.Martin D.W. Deb S.P. Klauer J.S. Deb S. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative conformation of an origin of DNA replication may also present new structural determinants for an interaction with the initiator protein. The binding of OBP to oriS* may be one example. It is an intriguing finding that OBP binds to oriS* formed from the double mutant oriS(−box I,−box III) but not from the single mutants oriS(−box I) and oriS(−box III). One explanation might be that box I and box III sequences interact directly in the oriS* structure. At least two models for oriS* should be considered (Fig.11). In the first case oriS* is shown as a central hairpin with 5′ and 3′ single-stranded tails (Fig.11 A). The second model contains two elements of secondary structure: the central hairpin with the AT-rich sequence in the loop is interacting with a second hairpin formed by complementary sequences in box I and box III (Fig. 11 B). The first model may describe the single mutants oriS(−box I) and oriS(−box III). The second alternative may reflect the conformation adopted by oriS(wt) and the double mutant oriS(−box I,−box III). This line of reasoning seems to imply that OBP binds oriS in a sequence-specific way and that it binds oriS* in a structure-specific fashion. The following experimental evidence suggest that our model of the OBP-oriS* complex is biologically significant. It has been shown that point mutations in boxes I, II, and III reduce DNA replication (12.Hernandez T.R. Dutch R.E. Lehman I.R. Gustafsson C. Elias P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oriS(−box II,−box III) double mutant replicates much less efficiently than the single mutants oriS(−box II) and oriS(−box III). In contrast, the oriS(−box I,−box III) double mutant replicates as efficiently as oriS(−box I). These findings argue that a functional interaction between sequence elements in box I and box III exists. Furthermore, selection experiments have emphasized that the box III region is an essential element in oriS (24.Hammarsten O. Elias P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1753-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the initiator protein, OBP, does not bind the box III region in duplex DNA with high affinity (20.Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17167-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results described in this paper show that box III is an important element for the binding of OBP to oriS*, and they indicate that box III is a part of a stable secondary structure in oriS*. The observations presented here suggest that a large scale conformational changes may be induced by initiator protein. The plasmid pT181 offers a good example. In this instance the dimeric RepC protein facilitates the extrusion of a cruciform in negatively supercoiled DNA followed by site-specific nicking by a topoisomerase-like mechanism in the newly formed loop (28.Jin R. Fernandez-Beros M.-E. Novick R.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4456-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Structural information on alternative conformations occurring in other replication origins is scarce. Replication origins do, however, in many instances contain palindrome structures or inverted repeats that are compatible with the formation of alternative DNA structures. It is conceivable that initiator proteins possess cryptic DNA binding sites that permit the recognition of activated forms of origins of DNA replication. It has, for example, been noted that the E. coli DnaC protein and the P protein of bacteriophage λ have cryptic binding sites for single-stranded DNA (29.Learn B.A. Um S.J. Huang L. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Origins of DNA replication play an essential role in the evolution of chromosomes inasmuch as they provide the chromosome with an identity that can be uniquely identified by the replication machinery. In this way preferential replication of a chromosome can be obtained. The evolution of new genetic elements such as viruses and plasmids may depend on the possibility of identifying new structures that will be unique to the developing chromosome. It is an intriguing possibility that interactions of the initiator proteins with alternative conformations of the origins might provide the structural information required for preferential replication."

Comprised of a total of nine individual subunits, holoTFIIH is unique among RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) initiation factors in that it possesses enzymatic activity (2.Feaver W.J. Gileadi O. Li Y.

The subunits Rad3 and Ssl2 endow holoTFIIH with bi-directional DNA helicase activity (3.Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Bardwell L. Bardwell A.J. Buratowski S. Gulyas K.D. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C.

TFIIH also has a kinase activity that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of Rpb1, the largest subunit of yeast RNA polymerase II. Under some conditions holoTFIIH can dissociate into the seven-subunit coreTFIIH and the two subunit TFIIK subcomplexes (4.Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). C-terminal domain kinase activity has been shown to reside in TFIIK (1.Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J.

The recent isolation of TFB2, TFB3, and TFB4 completed the cloning of genes encoding subunits of yeast TFIIH (6.Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19319-19327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All TFIIH subunits are encoded by essential genes and have highly conserved counterparts in humans (6.Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19319-19327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A requirement for yeast TFIIH in NER was first suggested by the identification of the well characterized DNA helicase and NER protein Rad3 as a subunit of core TFIIH (3.Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q.

This requirement was subsequently demonstrated directly using an in vitro NER assay (7.Wang Z. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Friedberg E.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To date, viable or conditional mutants of all the subunits of coreTFIIH except Tfb3 have been used to demonstrate a role for these polypeptides in NER (6.Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X.

In this study we report the generation of a yeast strain with a temperature-sensitive allele ofTFB3 (tfb3 ts ). This strain is sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in vivo and defective for NER in vitro. We conclude that Tfb3, like all coreTFIIH subunits, is indispensable for NER. A form of TFIIH has been identified that is associated with all of the other polypeptides known to be required for the early steps of NER in the absence of DNA damage. This large, preformed “super complex” is referred to as the nucleotide excision repairosome (4.Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D.

A number of earlier studies used a variety of approaches to reveal interactions between TFIIH and/or repairosome subunits (see references in Table II). The cloning of genes encoding the Tfb2, Tfb3, and Tfb4 polypeptides has facilitated the inclusion of these subunits as well. We report here two-hybrid interactions between Ssl2 and Tfb2, Rad3 and Tfb3, and Tfb4 and Ssl1. Based on these interactions together with those previously known, we propose a more refined model for the structure of coreTFIIH and the repairosome.Table IIInteractions between yeast TFIIH and repairosome subunitsInteractionMethodReference No.Tfb1/Ssl1TH3.Feaver W.J.

Plasmid pRS316/TFB3 was subsequently cured from transformants by growth on medium containing 1 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid. pRS315/TFB3 was constructed by subcloning the 3.5-kilobase HindIII fragment from pRS316/TFB3 into pRS315. pRS313/TFB3 was mutagenized in vitro with hydroxylamine and transformed into a haploid derivative of YPH500 containing pRS316/TFB3 and a chromosomal TFB3::LEU2 disruption. pRS313/tfb3ts was identified by its inability to grow in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid at the nonpermissive temperature. Sequencing revealed that a cysteine residue in the RING finger had been changed to tyrosine (C16Y). A more detailed description of the isolation of thetfb3 ts allele will be described elsewhere. 2O.

Transformants were patched onto minimal selective plates overlaid with Hybond-N filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and grown at 30 °C for 24 h. The filters were lifted, and the cells were lysed by one cycle of freeze/thawing in liquid nitrogen. The filters were incubated at 30 °C with 2.5 mg/ml X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside) in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 40 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) until color development was apparent. An interaction between fusion proteins was scored positive when β-galactosidase activity was significantly increased over controls lacking either one of the fusions. Growth of cells, preparation of whole cell extracts, measurement of in vitro NER activity, and quantification were as previously reported (8.Wang Z. Buratowski S. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X.

Huang W Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29564-29567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were performed by a standard lithium acetate protocol. YPD media contained 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bacto peptone, and 2% (w/v) dextrose. HoloTFIIH was prepared as previously reported (1.Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. LaPoint J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28044-28048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate a possible role of Tfb3 protein in NER, we generated a yeast strain containing a viable mutant allele of TFB3. Previous work showed that deletion of a small region of the C terminus of either Ssl2, Tfb1, or Tfb2 resulted in UV radiation sensitivity and defective NER in vitro (6.Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, deletion of either 22 (tfb3Δ1) or 46 (tfb3Δ2) amino acids from the C terminus of Tfb3 was lethal, indicating that this region is essential for Tfb3 function (data not shown). We previously showed that when fused to the DNA-binding domain ofGal4, Tfb3 activates expression of a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid containing Gal4 binding sites (6.Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19319-19327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mutant alleles tfb3Δ1 andtfb3Δ2 also activated transcription in this assay, indicating that the C terminus of Tfb3 protein is not required for this activity (data not shown). We also previously showed that Tfb3 interacts with the Kin28 subunit of TFIIK, leading to the speculation that Tfb3 activates transcription by direct recruitment of TFIIK (6.Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19319-19327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The observation that tfb3Δ1 can still interact with Kin28 is consistent with this model (data not shown); however, other possible models of Tfb3 transcriptional activation cannot be excluded. In view of the inviability of TFB3 deletion mutants, we generated a conditional, temperature-sensitive (ts) allele of the gene. The tfb3 ts allele was isolated by standard yeast genetic techniques as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.1 A, thetfb3 ts strain failed to grow at 37 °C but grew normally at 30 °C. The isogenic wild-type strain grew at both temperatures (Fig. 1 A). An increase in doubling time at the permissive temperature for the mutant strain (TFB3, 105 min;tfb3 ts, 180 min) is consistent with partial impairment of the essential function. When tested for UV radiation sensitivity, a hallmark of defective NER, the mutant was found to be more sensitive than the isogenic wild-type at 30 °C (Fig.1 B). The magnitude of this effect was more pronounced at the semipermissive temperature of 33 °C (Fig. 1 B), supporting our conclusion that UV radiation sensitivity is the result of thermolability of the tfb3 ts protein. To rule out the possibility that tfb3 ts is indirectly sensitive to UV radiation as a result of defective transcription of DNA repair genes, we tested the ability of extracts from wild-type andtfb3 ts cells to perform NER in vitro (18.Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Methods. 1995; 7: 177-186Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar,19.Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Mutat. Res. 1996; 364: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared from each strain and incubated with two plasmid DNA substrates, one of which contained base damage. NER activity was measured as the amount of repair synthesis specifically occurring on the damaged substrate as described previously (18.Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Methods. 1995; 7: 177-186Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19.Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Mutat. Res. 1996; 364: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this assay tfb3 ts was almost completely defective for NER (Fig. 2 A,lanes 4–5), whereas the wild-type extract possessed considerable activity (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–3). To confirm that defective NER in tfb3 ts was specifically due to the mutation in the TFB3 gene, we tested the ability of purified holoTFIIH (1.Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. LaPoint J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28044-28048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to complement the mutant extract. Core and holoTFIIH have been shown to be equally active for NER in vitro (4.Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). As is shown in Fig. 2 B, the addition of purified holoTFIIH did indeed restore NER to the mutant extract. We conclude from these experiments that the Tfb3 subunit of yeast TFIIH is required for NER. Complementation between NER-defective whole cell extracts from various NER mutant strains has previously been used to gain insights into protein-protein interactions (8.Wang Z. Buratowski S. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2288-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For example, tfb2 andssl1 extracts fail to complement one another for defective NER activity in vitro, presumably due to the low rate of exchange of these TFIIH subunits (Fig. 3,lanes 1–3). In contrast, the tfb3 ts extract could be complemented by either rad14 orrad23 extracts (Fig. 3, lanes 4–8), consistent with the notion that these proteins are not tightly associated. These results predict that tfb3 ts can not be complemented by extracts from either ssl1 or tfb2 mutant cells. However, surprisingly, the tfb3 ts extract could be complemented by either ssl1 or tfb2mutant extracts (Fig. 3, lanes 9–12). These results suggest that under the conditions of our in vitro NER assay, exchange of Tfb3 can occur. In eukaryotic cells, caffeine is known to adversely affect genomic stability, at least in part by inhibiting DNA repair and/or overriding DNA damage checkpoint controls (20.Siede W. Obermaier S. Eckardt F. Radiat. Environ. Biophys. 1985; 24: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21.Rowley R. Zhang J. Genetics. 1999; 152: 61-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to determine whether UV radiation sensitivity could be increased by inclusion of caffeine in the growth media, we were surprised to observe thattfb3 ts failed to grow in the presence of the drug, whereas the isogenic wild-type strain grew normally (Fig.4). In contrast totfb3 ts, an NER-defective C-terminal tfb2deletion mutant (6.Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19319-19327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) did not exhibit abnormal sensitivity to caffeine (Fig. 4). Thus caffeine sensitivity of tfb3 ts does not appear to be a direct or indirect result of defective NER. It also seems unlikely that caffeine sensitivity is the result of defective transcription of genes required for caffeine detoxification, since there is no evidence of a significant transcription defect intfb3 ts at the permissive temperature. Consistent with this conclusion, tfb3 ts did not exhibit inositol auxotrophy at 30 °C (data not shown), a phenotype commonly associated with transcription-defective mutants (22.Archambault J. Jansma D.B. Friesen J.D. Genetics. 1996; 142: 737-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conceivably caffeine sensitivity is related to an as-yet unidentified function of Tfb3 and/or TFIIH. As mentioned above, a number of studies have revealed pair-wise interactions between yeast TFIIH subunits (see references given in Table II). The recent cloning of genes encoding Tfb2, Tfb3, and Tfb4 has allowed a more comprehensive analysis of interactions between subunits of this yeast transcription factor. Using the two-hybrid assay (23.Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar), we qualitatively tested the ability of Tfb2, Tfb3, and Tfb4 to interact with other subunits of TFIIH (TableI). A list of pairs of fusion proteins tested is given in Table I. Of all the interactions and controls tested, three gave significantly higher levels of β-galactosidase activity than either of the fusion proteins alone; Tfb3 and Rad3 (Fig.5 A), Ssl2 and Tfb2 (Fig.5 B), Tfb4 and Ssl1 (Fig. 5 B). None of the fusion constructs giving these interactions behaved as “promiscuous interactors” (Fig. 5 and Table I). In the latter two cases an interaction was not observed with fusion proteins in the opposite orientation, a result not uncommon with this technique. In this report we present evidence that Tfb3, like the other subunits of yeast transcription/repair factor TFIIH, is directly involved in NER. We base this conclusion on UV radiation sensitivity of cells and defective NER in extracts, using a strain harboring a temperature-sensitive allele of TFB3 (tfb3 ts). We have previously shown that polyclonal antisera against Tfb3 can partially inhibit RNA polymerase II transcription in vitro(6.Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19319-19327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A different temperature-sensitive allele of TFB3 has been shown to be defective for transcription at the nonpermissive temperature (24.Faye G. Simon M Valay J.G. Fesquet D. Facca C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the Tfb3 protein is required for both NER and RNA polymerase II transcription. The moderate level of UV radiation sensitivity of thetfb3 ts mutant does not correlate quantitatively with the severe defect in NER in vitro. Similar results were observed for a TFB2 C-terminal deletion mutant (6.Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19319-19327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It would appear that in these cases the partial NER defect in vivo is amplified in the in vitro assay. In contrast to our results, another group has reported that yeast cells carrying different mutant alleles of TFB3 (RIG2) are not sensitive to UV radiation, leading to the conclusion that Tfb3 protein is not required for NER (24.Faye G. Simon M Valay J.G. Fesquet D. Facca C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, these mutants were not directly tested for NER activity in vitro. These investigators isolatedTFB3 alleles in a screen designed to identify mutations synthetically lethal with a temperature-sensitive allele ofKIN28. Perhaps the different way in which our mutant was isolated can explain our apparently contradictory results. Given the relatively tight association of Tfb3 with core TFIIH based on co-purification, we find it implausible that all of the other subunits of core TFIIH play a role in NER but not Tfb3. Our observation that under the conditions of in vitro NER employed in these experiments some exchange of Tfb3 between TFIIH complexes can occur is intriguing. Under similar conditions, no exchange of Tfb1, Ssl1, or Tfb2 was observed (6.Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19319-19327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8.Wang Z. Buratowski S. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2288-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, similar observations have been made with Ssl2 (7.Wang Z. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Friedberg E.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and the selective loss of Ssl2 during purification suggests that Ssl2 is loosely associated with the other coreTFIIH subunits (3.Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Bardwell L. Bardwell A.J. Buratowski S. Gulyas K.D. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 1379-1387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is no evidence from purification of TFIIH that Tfb3 is more loosely associated than other TFIIH subunits. In addition, conditions that promote dissociation of TFIIK and Rad3 from holoTFIIH do not appear to cause significant loss of Tfb3 (4.Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Human TFIIH exhibits the opposite behavior. Upon dissociation, MAT1, the ortholog of Tfb3, is identified as a component of CAK, the human counterpart of yeast TFIIK (25.Adamczewski J.P. Rossingol M. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1877-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26.Fisher R.P. Jin P. Chamberlin H.M. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1995; 83: 47-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We previously attributed this behavior to differences in relative affinities between subunits in the yeast and human TFIIH factors (6.Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19319-19327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, our observation that Tfb3 can undergo subunit exchange suggests that a form of Tfb3 associated with TFIIK in yeast remains to be identified. The interactions between Rad3/Tfb3, Ssl2/Tfb2, and Tfb4/Ssl1 reported here prompted us to propose a more detailed model of the subunit organization of yeast TFIIH and the repairosome (Fig.6). A summary of the pairwise interactions upon which these models are based is given in TableII. It should be noted that additional interactions not listed in Table II have been inferred based on extensive co-purification of various proteins. For example, replication protein A has been shown to be comprised of three subunits, Rpa1, Rpa2, and Rpa3 (27.Brill S. Stillman B. Nature. 1989; 342: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), overexpressed Rad2 can be purified as a component of TFIIH (28.Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A total volume of 250 μl of exudate yielded 380 μg of purified peptide.

The skin peptide, named skin calcitonin gene-related peptide, differs significantly from all other members of the calcitonin gene-related peptide family of peptides at nine positions but binds with high affinity to calcitonin gene-related peptide receptors in the rat brain and acts as an agonist in the rat vas deferens bioassay with potencies equal to those of human CGRP. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction coupled with cDNA cloning and sequencing demonstrated that skin calcitonin gene-related peptide isolated in the skin is identical to that present in the frog's central and enteric nervous systems.

Neurobiol. 1997; 11: 167-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). CGRP is one of the most potent vasodilatory and cardiotonic endogenous peptides discovered so far. The vasodilatation elicited by CGRP in the central coronary and peripheral vasculature has led to its therapeutic evaluation in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm, angina, migraine, Raynaud's disease, and erectile dysfunction of the penis (4.Feuerstein G. Willette R. Alyar N. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1995; 73: 1070-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the skin, CGRP is synthesized and released from capsaicin-sensitive c-fibers and can activate a number of target cells including keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langherans cells, mast cells, and microvascular epithelial cells (5.Hara M. Toyoda M. Yaar M. Bhawan J. Avila E.M. Penner I.R. Gilchrest B.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6.Niizeki H. Alard P. Streilein J.W. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5183-5186PubMed Google Scholar). As such, CGRP can have both protective and pathophysiological effects by participating to the processes that occur during inflammation and wound healing in the skin. Despite a widespread distribution in virtually all organs, CGRP is present in the tissues in only minute quantities, making it difficult to chemically characterize the CGRP-like species detected by immunological methods. For instance, complete chemical identification of CGRP from the rabbit intestine was only achieved after extraction of 1 kg of intestines that yielded 10 μg (∼2.5 nmol) of purified peptide (7.Eysselein V.E. Reeve J.R. Sternini C. Cominelli F. Davis W.M. Davis M.T. Lee T.D. Ho F-J. Ridout D. Shively J.E. Peptides. 1991; 12: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In a similar vein, 30 μg of human CGRP have been extracted from 45 human spinal cords (625 g of frozen tissues), a tissue where this peptide is especially concentrated (8.Petermann J.B. Born W. Chang J-Y. Fischer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 542-545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Wimalawansa S.J. Morris H.R. Etienne A. Blench I. Panico M. Mac Intyre I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Likewise, identification and characterization of CGRP in the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract of the European frog Rana ridibunda required the handling of 1200 brains and 400 intestines, respectively (10.Conlon J.M. Tonon M.C. Vaudry H. Peptides. 1993; 14: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, the very low amount of CGRP that can be recovered in a pure form from animal tissues makes mandatory the use of costly synthetic replicates for conducting routine pharmacological and clinical investigations. On the other hand, the frog dermatous glands synthesize and expel an extraordinarily rich variety of mammalian-like hormones and neuropeptides (11.Renda T. D'Este L. Fasolo A. Lazarus L.H. Minniti F.

Amphibian peptides are often produced in such enormous quantities that it is possible to isolate enough material from a single specimen to determine the amino acid sequence and establish the pharmacological profile. This paper describes the isolation and characterization of CGRP from the skin exudate of a single living specimen of the arboreal frog Phyllomedusa bicolor, together with the cloning of its precursor and a preliminary evaluation of the pharmacological activity of the peptide. Frogs were placed in large wooden cages (120 × 90 × 90 cm; 12 animals/cage), covered on three sides by plastic mosquito net to provide good ventilation. Phyllodendron, Potos, and Dracena were used as perches, and water bowls were made available for nocturnal baths. The frogs were fed crickets. Humidity was kept at 65% by a constantly operating humidifier. Temperature was maintained at 25 ± 1 °C. 250 μl of peptide exudate were recovered from a single living frog specimen by gentle squeezing of the latero-dorsal portion of the skin and dissolved in 250 μl of 10% acetic acid. The homogenate was sonicated for 1 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 × g. The supernatant was recovered and fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC on a semipreparative column (Nucleosil 5-μm C18, 250 × 10 mm) using a solvent system composed of water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as solvent A and acetonitrile containing 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid as solvent B. The column was eluted at 0.75 ml/min with a 0–60% linear gradient of solvent B for 60 min. Aliquots of the fractions were assayed for CGRP-like immunoreactivity using an enzyme immunoassay procedure and a monoclonal anti-CGRP antibody as described previously (14.Frobert Y. Nevers M-C. Amadesi S. Volland H. Brune P. Geppetti P. Grassi J. Creminon C. Peptides. 1999; 20: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The immunoreactive fractions were pooled, freeze-dried, solubilized in 0.1 ml of water, and further fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC using an analytical C18 column (Lichrosorb 5-μm C18, 250 × 4.6 mm). Elution was achieved in 60 min with a 0–60% linear gradient of solvent B. Fractions were collected at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min, from which aliquots were assayed for immunoreactivity using the enzyme immunoassay procedure. Sequence determinations were carried out on a gas phase automatic protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems 476 A gas phase peptide sequanator). Phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were detected with an on-line Applied Biosystems 120A analyzer. Data collection and analysis were performed with an Applied Biosystems 900A module calibrated with 32.5 pmol of phenylthiohydantoin-derivative standards. Mass spectra of positive ions were recorded in reflectron mode with a single stage reflectron matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Voyager-STR, PerSeptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA) equipped with a delayed extraction device. Delayed extraction time was set at 200 ns. A saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Sigma) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was the matrix used for all MALDI experiments. External calibration was performed with a mixture of angiotensin, ACTH (clip 1–17), ACTH (clip 18–39), and ACTH (clip 7–38) with monoisotopic mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) values corresponding to protonated [M + H]+ ions of 1296.685, 2093.087, 2465.189, and 3657.93, respectively, and bovine insulin with an averagem/z value corresponding to [M + H]+of 5734.59. Spectra were obtained with a resolving powerM/ΔM from 6000 to 13,000 at 50% valley. 40 pmol of intact peptide were dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1 m ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.5. 1 μl of carboxypeptidase Y at a concentration of 2 ng/μl (carboxypeptidase Y sequencing grade; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the peptide solution. The mixture was left to react for 1, 2, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min at 37 °C. The digestion was stopped at the desired time by the addition of 0.3 μl of 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid. Mass spectrometric analysis of the digestion products was performed by mixing 0.5 μl of the digest with 0.5 μl of matrix. Skin calcitonin gene-related peptide was prepared by stepwise solid phase synthesis using Fmoc polyamide active ester chemistry on a Milligen 9050 Pepsynthesizer. Fmoc-amino acids and PAL-PEG-PS resin were from Milligen. Side chain protections were O-tert-butyl ester for aspartic acid, O-tert-butyl ether for threonine, and trityl for asparagine and glutamine. Synthesis was carried out using a triple coupling protocol: N α-Fmoc-amino acids (4.4 m excess) were coupled for 30–60 min with 0.23m diisopropylcarbodiimide in a mixture of dimethylformamide and dichloromethane (60:40, v/v). Acylation was checked after each coupling step by the Kaiser test. Cleavage of the peptidyl resins and side chain deprotection were carried out at a concentration of 40 mg of peptidyl resin in 1 ml of a mixture composed of trifluoroacetic acid, phenol, thioanisole, water, and ethyl methyl sulfide (82.5:5:5:5:2.5, v/v/v/v/v) for 2 h at room temperature. After filtering to remove the resin and ether precipitation at 20 °C, the crude peptide was recovered by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min, washed three times with cold ether, dried under nitrogen, dissolved in 20% acetic acid, and lyophilized. After lyophilization, the crude peptide was purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC on a Waters RCM compact preparative cartridge Deltapak C 18 (300 Å; 25 × 100 mm) eluted at a flow rate of 8 ml/min by a multistep linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (5 min; wash at 5% acetonitrile followed by a 5–60% linear gradient of acetonitrile at 0.5%/min). Homogeneity of the synthetic peptide was assessed by gas phase sequence analysis, mass spectrum analysis, and analytical HPLC on a Lichrosorb C18 column (5 μm; 4.6 × 250 mm) eluted at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min by a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid/water. Decerebellated whole brains of male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats weighing 200–300 g (Dépré; Saint Doulchard, France) were homogenized by four cycles of Polytron and centrifugation (20 min, 12,000 × g) at 4 °C (15.Sagan S. Amiche M. Delfour A. Mor A. Camus A. Nicolas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17100-17106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The buffer was 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. The yield of washed membranes equivalent to 10 brains was dispersed in 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. The final protein concentration of this extract was 9.25 mg/ml as determined by the method of Lowry et al. (16.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J; Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Binding assays were performed at 24 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 2% bovine serum albumin. Each assay contained, in a final volume of 500 μl, the membrane preparation (30 μl) and 32 pm human (2-[125I]iodohistidyl 10)-CGRP (∼2000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with or without unlabeled ligand. The tubes were incubated for 60 min. The binding reaction was terminated by rapid vacuum filtration through 0.1% polyethyleneimine-coated Whatman glass fiber filters (GF/B). The filters were washed five times with 3 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1m NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 2% bovine serum albumin. Specific binding was defined as total binding minus nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 1 μmunlabeled human CGRP. The specific binding represented about 80% of total binding when using 32 pm125I-labeled human CGRP. All determinations were performed in duplicate. The 50% inhibitory concentration values (IC50) were obtained from nonlinear least-squares regression to a two-parameter logistic equation of the percentage of specific binding versus log (dose) curves. The inhibitory constant (K i) of the various unlabeled ligands was calculated from the relationK i= IC50/(1 + (L/K d)) (17.Cheng Y. Prussof W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12266) Google Scholar), where Lrepresents the concentration of the labeled ligand, andK d is its equilibrum dissociation constant determined by saturation binding analysis. Synthetic and natural S-CGRPs were tested for their effectiveness in depressing electrically evoked contractions of the isolated vas deferens of the rat as described (18.Sagan S. Corbett A.D. Amiche M. Delfour A. Nicolas P. Kosterlitz H.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 104: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Human CGRP was used as an internal standard. Briefly, one adult male Harlan Sprague Dawley rat (180–200 g), obtained from Dépré, was sacrificed by decapitation. The rat vas deferens were dissected carefully and immediately placed in oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) Krebs-Ringer buffer solution (118 mmNaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.6 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 11 mm glucose maintained at 37 °C). The rat vas deferens were mounted on platinum electrodes in a bath containing 3 ml of oxygenated Krebs-Ringer buffer. The tissues were equilibrated for 1 h at a tension of 1 g. The tissues were stimulated with square electrical pulses using a Grass stimulator (model S88). The stimulation parameters were as follows: amplitude, 60 V; duration, 1 ms; frequency, 0.2 Hz. The responses were recorded on a Grass polygraph (model 79D) using a Grass force displacement transducer, model FT03 (Quincy, MA). Complete dose-response curves were constructed for each of the tested peptides (six different concentrations; six assays for each). Potencies were expressed as IC50 values (nm) determined by regression analysis. One adult specimen of Phyllomedusa bicolor was anesthetized with pentobarbital and immersed in liquid nitrogen and kept deep frozen until further processing. The skin was dissected on dry ice, and the tissues, approximately 7 g, were homogenized. Total RNAs were extracted as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (19.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNAs were purified over an affinity oligo(dT)-cellulose spun column supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and a cDNA library was constructed from skin poly(A+) RNA as described (20.Amiche M. Ducancel F. Mor A. Boulain J.C. Menez A. Nicolas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17847-17852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a standard procedure (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Recombinant plasmids of the library were extracted from bacteria grown at 37 °C for 16 h in LB medium containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin and linearized by BamHI or EcoRI. An aliquot of the cDNA linearized by BamHI was used for PCR. The reaction was performed using a sense primer T7 (primer T7: 5′-AATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) and an antisense degenerated primer corresponding to amino acids 25–31 of S-CGRP (primer 1: 5′-CKGTKGGKACRAARTCKGG-3′) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 240 s, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 40 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. At the end of the last cycle, the sample was further incubated at 72 °C for 5 min and electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gel. DNA fragments were excised from the gel and purified by the Qiaquick gel extraction kit protocol (Qiagen). The PCR product was cloned in the pGEMT-Easy vector system (Promega). Nucleotide sequencing analysis was performed by the dideoxy chain termination technique (22.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar) in double-stranded pGEMT-Easy vector. We used the fluorescence-labeled dye terminator method and an ABI 377 automatic sequencer. To determine the sequence of the 3′-end of the prepro-S-CGRP, we used cDNA cleaved by EcoRI as template with an antisense universal primer (primer PU: 5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTG-3′) and a 3′ sense gene-specific primer deducted from the 5′ cDNA prepro-S-CGRP (primer 2: 5′-CTCTCTCCTGGCTGTCCT-3′). The following thermal cycle profile was used for the rapid amplification of cDNA end PCRs: 94 °C for 240 s, 25 cycles of 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 54 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 60 s, and a final extension step of 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were purified by the Qiaquick kit (Qiagen), cloned in pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega), and sequenced as mentioned above. mRNAs from frog brain and intestine were prepared using the Micro-FastTrack kit (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR System (Life Technologies, Inc.). Both cDNA synthesis and PCR were performed in a single tube using specific primers deduced from the skin prepro-SCGRP (primer 3 sense: 5′-GGGTCACAGAGGCGCACA-3′; primer 4 antisense: 5′-GCAGTCCCGCCAGAAGCA-3′) and mRNA from frog brain or intestine. The following thermal cycle profile was used for the PCR: 94 °C for 240 s, 25 cycles of 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 56 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 60 s, and a final extension step of 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were purified by Qiaquick Kit (Qiagen), cloned in pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega), and sequenced as mentioned above. CGRP was purified to homogeneity from P. bicolor skin exudate by a two-step protocol. 250 μl of skin exudate recovered by gentle squeezing of the latero-dorsal portion of the skin of a single living frog were first fractionated on a reverse-phase HPLC semipreparative column. As shown in Fig.1, the CGRP enzyme immunoassay revealed a single zone of immunoreactivity. The immunoreactive material was pooled and further fractionated on a reverse-phase HPLC analytical column. As depicted in Fig. 2, the initial immunoreactive material was recovered under a single symmetrical sharp peak accounting for >95% of the eluted material. The amount of purified peptide recovered was 380 μg starting from 250 μl of exudate. This purified material was used for further chemical and biological analysis.Figure 2Reverse-phase HPLC separation of the immunoreactive fraction recovered from Fig. 1 using an analytical C18 column (Lichrosorb 5-μm C18, 250 × 4.6 mm). Elution was achieved in 60 min with a 0–60% linear gradient (dashed line) of solvent B. Fractions were collected at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min.

Since no phenylthiohydantoin signals were obtained in positions 2 and 7, an aliquot of the purified peptide was reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine, and subjected to Edman degradation. After this treatment, two S-pyridylethylated cysteine derivatives were obtained, at cycles 2 and 7, respectively. No alkylated cysteines were observed at these positions when the reduction step was omitted, suggesting that the two cysteines were forming an intramolecular disulfide bridge in the native peptide. The purified peptide was also subjected to mass spectrometric analysis using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig.3 A). The monoisotopic mass-to-charge ratio obtained for the protonated peptide (3806.77) suggested that we did not have the full sequence of the molecule. To gain additional information about the sequence, the molecule was subjected to carboxypeptidase Y digestion, and the resulting digestion fragments were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 3,B and C). Using this procedure, the C-terminal amino acid sequence of the peptide was unambiguously identified as TDVSANSF amide. From the results of the above experiments, a sequence of 37 residues could be proposed for the skin peptide as SCDTSTCATQRLADFLSRSGGIGSPDFVPTDVSANSF amide, with the 2 cysteines forming an intramolecular disulfide bridge. The experimental monoisotopic mass of the protonated peptide, measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (3806.77), corresponds to the theoretical mass calculated from this proposed sequence (3806.74). This suggested first that we had the full sequence of the peptide and second that the peptide is carboxyamidated and possesses a disulfide bridge. A computer search comparing the skin peptide sequence to protein sequences contained in the Swiss-Prot protein data base revealed 50–80% amino acid positional identity with the calcitonin gene-related peptide family of peptides and 40–45% identity with the amylin family of peptides (Fig. 4). Identities with peptides of the calcitonin and adrenomedulin families were much lower. Accordingly, the novel frog skin peptide was named skin calcitonin gene- related peptide (S-CGRP). S-CGRP was synthesized by the solid phase method to confirm the proposed structure and to demonstrate that biological activities of the purified natural peptide reflected intrinsic properties. After purification by HPLC on a reverse-phase C18 column, synthetic CGRP was shown to be indistinguishable from the natural product by the following criteria. HPLC analysis revealed that synthetic CGRP eluted exactly at the same position as the natural corresponding product (Fig. 2); coinjection of the native and synthetic peptides resulted in only one symmetrical peak; mass spectrometric analysis of the synthetic peptide gave a monoisotopic mass to charge ratio of 3806.58 for the protonated peptide; the natural and the synthetic peptides have almost identical receptor binding activities. To allocate definitively S-CGRP to the calcitonin gene-related peptide family of peptides, we used polymerase chain reaction to amplify the nucleotide sequence encoding prepro-S-CGRP from skin poly(A+) mRNA. We have cloned and sequenced an 825-bp cDNA revealing an open reading frame encoding a 115-amino acid prepropeptide (Fig.5). The deduced amino acid sequence begins with a putative signal peptide rich in hydrophobic amino acid residues. The peptide bond between Ala25 and Ala26 is the best point for cleavage by a signal peptidase, as determined by the method of Von Heijne (23.Von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). The putative signal sequence (residues 1–25) is immediately followed by a proregion (residues 26–67) comprising 42 residues with a pair of basic residues Lys68-Arg69 at its carboxyl terminus. The S-CGRP progenitor sequence, which is directly C-terminally flanked to the proregion, terminates by a Gly residue, which serves as an amide donor and a tetrabasic cleavage site. Cleavage of the precursors at the carboxyl side of these proteolytic signals by endoproteases and removal of the basic residues by carboxypeptidases would also liberate the mature frog skin CGRP. The cDNA sequence clearly confirmed the amino acid sequence of S-CGRP obtained by biochemical methods. Furthermore, the extensive sequence identities that are present between the CGRP precursors originating from various animal species and that of the novel skin peptide (51–70% at the amino acid level; 46–53% at the nucleotide level) are not found with the amylin precursors. It is thus likely that the 37-residue skin peptide isolated herein represents a novel member of the CGRP family of peptides. The distribution of mRNA for prepro-S-CGRP was examined by RT-PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers (see “Materials and Methods”). A single strong amplification signal was observed at the expected size in the skin, the intestine, and the brain (Fig.6). To certify that the amplified products correspond to prepro-S-CGRP mRNA, the purified PCR products were cloned in pGEM-Easy vector and sequenced. As shown in Fig. 5, isolated clones from the intestine and the brain have the same sequence as the skin prepro-S-CGRP except for one neutral third base change in the mature S-CGRP sequence, one change in the tetrabasic cleavage signal, and three nucleotide mutations in the 3′-noncoding region. The receptor binding profiles of natural and synthetic S-CGRP for CGRP sites of the rat brain were determined by competition experiments using 125I-labeled human CGRP as prototypical radiolabeled ligand. As expected, both peptides competitively inhibited the high affinity specific125I-labeled human CGRP binding in a concentration-dependent manner, with identical 50% inhibitory concentrations (K i = 0.13 and 0.12 nm, respectively, for natural and synthetic skin CGRP) and quasi-Hill coefficients close to unity (Fig.7). The inhibitory constantK i of the natural and synthetic S-CGRP toward the sites labeled by 125I-labeled human CGRP were almost identical to that determined for unlabeled human CGRP under similar experimental conditions (K i = 0.25 nm). The displacement curves for these unlabeled ligands could all be fit to a simple competitive model assuming only one homogeneous population of binding sites. No evidence for a more complicated model was observed. Since binding assays do not determine whether S-CGRP acts as an agonist or an antagonist, we have tested synthetic and natural S-CGRPs for their effectiveness in depressing electrically evoked contractions of the isolated vas deferens of the rat (24.Wisskirchen F.M. Burt R.P. Marshall I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Human CGRP was used as an internal standard. As shown in Fig. 8, human CGRP (IC50 = 38.8 nm), synthetic S-CGRP (IC50 = 26.2 nm), and natural S-CGRP (IC50 = 26.9 nm) were equiactive in the vas deferens bioassay. The inhibitory effects of these peptides were fully reversed by the prototypical antagonist human CGRP-(8–37) (Fig. 8) but remained unaffected by the addition of peptidase inhibitors (not shown). One of the most fascinating stories in comparative biochemistry is represented by the studies of Erspamer and colleagues on amphibian skin secretions (12.Erspamer V. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1992; 10: 3-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). They discovered in skin extracts a host of novel, biologically active peptides bearing close structural and pharmacological similarities to mammalian peptides that interact primarily with receptors of the central and peripheral nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. As a result of the repeated discovery of structural correspondence between frog skin peptides and mammalian neuropeptides and hormones, Erspamer et al. (25.Erspamer V. Melchiorri P. Broccardo M. Falconieri-Erspamer G. Falaschi P. Impota G. Negri L. Renda T. Peptides. 1981; 2: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) predicted that each peptide discovered in the skin would have a counterpart in the brain and the gut of mammals (i.e. the so-called brain-skin-gut triangle hypothesis). So far, more than 200 different biologically active peptides have been isolated from skin extracts of various frog species at a still increasing pace and with no signs yet of exhaustion (13.Lazarus L.H. Attila M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 437-507Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Most of these peptides belong to families that have their counterparts in mammals. Examples are many and include bradykinins, angiotensins, tachykinins, bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide, hypophysiotropic neuropeptides, pancreatic polypeptide/peptide tyrosine-tyrosine/neuropeptide tyrosine, and the opioid peptides dermorphin/deltorphins. The discovery of calcitonin gene-related peptide in the skin of P. bicolor adds further support to the brain-skin-gut triangle hypothesis and suggests that other members of the superfamily may also be present in the skin. In the present study, 380 μg of S-CGRP have been purified to homogeneity from 250 μl of the milky exudate obtained by gentle squeezing of the latero-dorsal portion of the skin of a single living frog. This procedure can be repeated every 10 days to allow the complete replenishment of the dermatous glands. Therefore, frog skin provides us with an inexhaustible and low cost source of natural CGRP that can be easily purified in great quantities by a two-step purification scheme. The CGRP family of peptides includes the 37-amino acid peptide CGRP and the 37-residue peptide amylin, which is found in pancreatic islet β-cells (26.Rink T.J. Beaumont K. Koda J. Young A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27.Cooper G.J.S. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 163-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). There is considerable conservation of sequences between CGRP and amylin, including the N-terminal disulfide bridge, the C-terminal amide, and adjacent regions. Hand alignments of the novel skin peptide with CGRP originating from various animal species showed 50–80% amino acid positional identities (Fig. 4). There is rather less identity (40–45% identity) with members of the amylin family. Furthermore, the extensive sequence similarities that are present between the precursors for CGRP and that of the novel skin peptide (51–70% at the amino acid level; 46–53% at the nucleotide level) are not found with the amylin precursors. These findings make it likely that the 37-residue skin peptide isolated herein, named S-CGRP, represents a novel member of the CGRP family of peptides. Although the same peptide is also present in the brain and the intestine of the frog, the physiological significance of its presence in huge amounts in the skin is unclear. Besides α-CGRP, another form, β-CGRP, is expressed in human and rat, which is encoded by a different gene (8.Petermann J.B. Born W. Chang J-Y. Fischer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 542-545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28.Edbrooke M.R. Parker D. Mc Vey J.H. Riley J.H. Sorenson G.D. Pettengill O.S. Craig R.K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29.Amara S.G. Arriza J.L. Leff S.E. Swanson L.W. Evans R.M. Rosenfeld M.G.

FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In the rat, β-CGRP differs from α-CGRP by 1 residue in position 35. In humans, the amino acid sequences of α- and β-CGRP differ in the midregion of the peptides, at positions 3, 22, and 25. Therefore, there are no specific positions that may indicate whether S-CGRP resembles more closely α- or β-CGRP. To completely reverse the actions of CGRP would suggest that CGRP-(8–37) has a pA2 of 7 or greater in this system. Although the antagonist concentration used in these experiments is high, this may suggest that the rat vas deferens is expressing something more like a CGRP 1 receptor subtype, not the CGRP 2 subtype that would be expected in this tissue (24.Wisskirchen F.M. Burt R.P. Marshall I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the basis of pharmacological evidence, the existence of at least two CGRP receptor subtypes has been proposed as well as independent binding sites for amylin (31.Poyner D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 424-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 32.Hall J.M. Smith D.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 303-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, consolidation of this hypothesis is awaiting the development of potent subtype-selective agonists and antagonists. S-CGRP has Ser, Ala, Gln, Ser, Asp, Ser, and Ser at positions 5, 8, 10, 24, 26, 33, and 36, whereas all other members of the CGRP family have Ala, Val, His, Lys, Asn, Gly, and Ala at the corresponding positions (Fig. 4). In addition, the skin peptide is slightly acidic, with a net charge of −1, as compared with the other CGRPs, which have 3–6 positive charges. The changes at the C terminus are particularly striking, since this has been proposed as a crucial determinant for high affinity binding and activity (33.Rist B. Entzeroth M. Beck-Sickinger A.G. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), yet S-CGRP is a potent agonist, being as active as human CGRP in displacing radiolabeled human CGRP from rat brain receptors and in inhibiting the electrically evoked contractions in the rat vas deferens preparations. This indicates that the changes to the sequence have not any real significance for binding and activity in these assays. By taking advantage of these sequence differences, the evaluation of the structure-activity relationships of S-CGRP in various tissues and pharmacological model systems may provide a starting point for the design of agonists and antagonists with high selectivity for CGRP receptor subtypes.

Cloning of the epitope recognized by an OSM-neutralizing anti-gp130 monoclonal antibody identified a portion of gp130 receptor localized in the EF loop of the cytokine binding domain. Site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding region was carried out by alanine substitution of residues 186–198.

When positions Val-189/Tyr-190 and Phe-191/Val-192 were alanine-substituted, Scatchard analyses indicated a complete abrogation of OSM binding to both type receptors. Interestingly, binding of LIF to type 1 receptor was not affected, corroborating the notion that in this case gp130 mostly behaves as a converter protein rather than a binding receptor. The present study demonstrates that positions 189–192 of gp130 cytokine binding domain are essential for OSM binding to both gp130/LIF receptor β and gp130/OSM receptor β heterocomplexes.

Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues located in the intracellular domain of the cytokine receptors will serve as docking sites for adapters and transcription factors.

Substitution of amino acid residues in the CBD of gp130 led to the identification of Val-252, located in the B′C′ loop of the receptor, essential for IL-6 binding and subsequent activation processes (33.Horsten U.

A recent study also reported that amino acids Tyr-190 and Phe-191 located in the EF loop are prevalent for the interaction of gp130 with IL-6 and IL-11 when associated with their respective α receptor components (35.Kurth I. Horsten U. Planz S. Dahmen H. Küster A. Grötzinger J. Heinrich P.C. Muller-Newen G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1480-1487PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, based on the molecular identification of an EF loop epitope implicated in the binding of a neutralizing OSM anti-gp130 antibody, we have substituted the amino acid residues of this portion with alanines. The results show that VY189/190AA and FV191/192AA mutations induced a dramatic reduction of OSM binding to gp130/LIFRβ or gp130/OSMRβ receptor complexes.DISCUSSIONB-S1 and B-N4 antibodies belong to group of anti-gp130 mAbs that are able to neutralize OSM binding to type 1 and type 2 OSM receptors, as well the subsequent signaling events and functional responses (36.Chevalier S.

Klein B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3474-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, binding of B-S1 to gp130 did not affect binding and biological responses to LIF or cardiotrophin-1. This result suggested that B-S1 antibody might recognize a critical site on gp130 required for recruitment of gp130 into a productive signaling complex.That B-S1 failed to recognize gp130 when the protein was denatured suggested the epitope was likely of conformational nature. For this reason epitope cloning was carried out starting from a constrained peptide display phage library containing two fixed cysteines in the random peptide sequence. Comparison of the isolated peptide with gp130 led to the identification of a single homology region located in the EF loop of the gp130 CBD. To rule out any possible indirect effect of the antibody on OSM binding and receptor activation, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was conducted on the EF loop.We determined that VY189/190AA and FV191/192AA mutations resulted in a dramatic reduction of OSM binding to gp130/LIFRβ complex receptor as well as the subsequent phosphorylations and signaling events. These mutations apparently did not affect the protein folding in COS-7 cells, since the binding of a series of anti-gp130 mAb-recognizing conformational epitopes was unaffected by the presence of the mutations. Interestingly, introduced EF mutations did not modify gp130 recognition by the B-S1 antibody. This might be linked to the implication of multipoint noncontiguous stretches in the formation of the conformational epitope recognized by the antibody. Similarly, a neutralizing anti-IL-2 receptor γ chain antibody was shown to bind to the protein through four discontinuous contact sites (54.Raskin N. Jakubowski A. Sizing I.D. Olson D.L. Kalled S.L. Hession C.A. Benjamin C.D. Baker D.P. Burly L.C. J. Immuol. 1998; 161: 3474-3483PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a modeling study of the introduced mutations indicated the absence of significant change in the structure of the CBD of gp130.VY189/190AA and FV191/192AA mutants were found to also lose their capacity to significantly bind OSM when expressed together with OSMRβ. This indicates that gp130 is likely activated in a similar fashion in both OSM receptor type complexes. In contrast, mutations at positions 189/190 or 191/192 did not affect the high affinity binding of LIF to the gp130/LIFRβ heterodimeric receptor. This observation is in line with a preferential binding of LIF to LIFRβ, gp130 playing in this case a role of converting protein (16.Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J.K. Brasher K. King J.A. Gillis S. Mosley B. Science. 1992; 255: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Moreover when gp130 was expressed alone in mammalian cells, LIF failed to compete with OSM for receptor binding (16.Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J.K. Brasher K.

Similarly, a specific site inactivation for GM-CSF and IL-5 high affinity binding, which only weakly affected IL-3 binding, was previously reported in the B′C′ loop of the common β chain for this cytokine family (55.Woodcock J.M.

Additionally, introduction of mutations in the EF loop of the common β subunit for GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 failed to affect ligand binding, similar to that observed in the present work for LIF (56.Bagley C.J. Woodcock J.M. Stomski F.C. Lopez A.F. Blood. 1997; 89: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that cytokine binding to the EF loop of receptors is not an absolute requirement to get functional responses. It will be of interest to analyze the ciliary neurotrophic factor and cardiotrophin-1 behaviors toward gp 130 EF loop.Topological similarities between type I cytokine receptors led to the identification of three loops linking β strand elements important for ligand binding. The B′C′ loop located in the second part of the CBD was reported to play a prominent role for binding and activation of growth hormone receptor (57.Clackson T. Wells J.A.

A similar observation was reported for implication of Gly-306 and Lys-307 residues in the binding of IL-6 to the F′G′ loop of gp130 (33.Horsten U. Muller-Newen G. Gerhartz C. Wollmer A. Wijdenes J.

The prominent solvent-exposed residue, Phe-191, in the EF loop of the CBD was shown to likely be important for gp130 interaction with its ligands. A molecular model of IL-6/IL-6 receptor/gp130 based on the structure of the GH/GH receptor allowed the selection of a few amino acids for site-directed mutagenesis (33.Horsten U. Muller-Newen G.

In the present work we show that similar residues and possibly some of the surrounding amino acids were also important for OSM binding to gp130 and functional recruitment of type 1 and 2 OSM receptors. In contrast, the EF loop does not appear to be essential for LIF binding.Analysis of naturally occurring mutations in IL-2 receptor γ chain revealed single residue substitutions at positions 131 or 134 in the EF loop were responsible for a decrease in IL-2 binding affinity and part of the X-linked severe congenital immunodeficiency syndromes (63.Ishii N.

https://openalex.org/W2149829089,"The small proline-rich protein, SPRR1, is a marker gene whose expression in conducting airway epithelium is elevated under a variety of conditions that enhance squamous differentiation. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the nature of the SPRR1 sequence involved in cross-linked envelope formation in a tissue/cell type, such as conducting airway epithelium, that normally does not express squamous function except after injury or maintenance in culture. For this, a Flag-SPRR1 fusion protein expression system has been developed. Using the liposome-mediated gene transfer technique on passage 1 culture of human tracheobronchial epithelial (TBE) cells, the Flag-SPRR1 fusion protein can be expressed and detected immunologically by both anti-Flag and anti-SPRR1 antibodies. The incorporation of Flag-SPRR1 fusion protein into cross-linked envelopes can be demonstrated when transfected human passage 1 TBE cultures are treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and high calcium (1.5 mM). By deletion and site-directed mutagenesis, two distinct roles of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences of SPRR1 have been demonstrated. First, we demonstrated that the amino-terminal sequence of SPRR1 protein is required for the incorporation of the fusion protein into cross-linked envelopes, whereas a deletion on the carboxyl-terminal region or on the middle repetitive unit has no effect. Interestingly, insertion of a 24-amino acid peptide of monkey MUC2 repetitive sequence in the amino-terminus of SPRR1 protein had a stimulatory effect. Site-directed mutagenesis on the following amino acid residues, Lys(7), Gln(88), and Lys(89), which were found previously to participate in the cross-linked envelope formation of keratinocytes, had no detrimental effect on the incorporation. However, mutations on Gln clusters, such as Gln(4)-Gln(6) and Gln(22)-Gln(25), had detrimental effects on the incorporation. These results suggest an amino-terminal sequence-dependent and multiple cross-linked sites for the incorporation of Flag-SPRR1 fusion protein into cross-linked envelopes of cultured human TBE cells. Second, we demonstrated that the carboxyl terminus of SPRR1 protein is required for a high level of Flag-fusion protein expression. A deletion in the carboxyl region or a mutation on the last lysine residue of the carboxyl end had a detrimental effect on the level of Flag-SPRR1 fusion protein expressed in transfected cells. In contrast, there was only a slight decrease in the level of expression if the amino-terminus was deleted. Interestingly, the efficiency for fusion protein to incorporate into cross-linked envelopes was elevated by the mutation at the carboxyl end. These results suggest distinct roles, perhaps coordinately, for both amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences in the regulation of the life cycle of SPRR1 protein in cultured TBE cells."

We examined various intracellular factors involved in the induction of light chain shifting. Light chain shifting can be induced upon treatment with agents with phosphatase inhibitory activity such as caffeine and okadaic acid. Although the plasma cells used express both RAG-1 and RAG-2, the expression level of these proteins was not affected by caffeine or okadaic acid. Transcription of the germ line locus, which correlates to the locus activation for rearrangement, is also not influenced by phosphatase inhibition. However, the amount of signal broken-ended DNA intermediates generated during V(D)J rearrangement was shown to increase upon caffeine or okadaic acid treatment. The inhibitory activity of caffeine on phosphatase was the same as okadaic acid. However, caffeine exhibited much higher activity for VJ coding joint formation than okadaic acid. Therefore, although phosphatase inhibition might act, in part, on a mechanism by which V(D)J recombinase activity is regulated within the human plasma cells, other factor(s) are probably also involved in the process.

Blood. 1999; 93: 198-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Several factors have been shown to be involved in Ig gene rearrangement in terms of timing and placement (1.Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). V(D)J recombinase activity is determined by the regulated expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 (3.Schatz D.G. Oettinger M.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 59: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). These genes are expressed only when B cells rearrange the Ig heavy and light chain loci. The RAG gene products are necessary for Ig recombination, and coexpression of these two genes in nonlymphoid cells is sufficient to confer the ability to recombine artificial plasmid substrates (15.Yancopoulos G. Blackwell T. Suh H. Hood L. Alt F.W. Cell. 1986; 44: 251-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Secondary VJ rearrangements in immature B cells and our plasma B cells are closely correlated with coexpression of the two RAG genes (10.Han S. Dillon S.R. Zheng B. Shimoda M. Schlissel M.S.

However, there must be additional levels of regulation to determine which loci are targeted for recombination in developing lymphocytes, because endogenous Ig genes are only targeted for complete rearrangement in B lineage cells, and endogenous T cell receptor genes are only completely rearranged in T lineage cells. Plus we have also found that enhancement of RAG expression is not sufficient to induce secondary VJ rearrangement in light chain shifting-inducible human plasma cells (13.Tachibana H. Ushio Y.

Blood. 1999; 93: 198-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 is likely to be only part of the mechanism by which V(D)J recombination is activated in lymphoid cells. In lymphoid cells, specific developmental signals result in changes in the chromatin that allows the recombinase access to particular gene segments (16.Stanhope-Baker P. Hudson K.M. Shaffer A.L.

However, phosphatase inhibition by caffeine or okadaic acid was found to be necessary to induce secondary VJ recombination. The phosphatase inhibition induced the formation of signal broken-ended DNA intermediates in the cells, which is an initial step in the V(D)J recombination process.DISCUSSIONWe have previously found that the λ light chain replacement from an original to a novel chain can be induced in some human plasma cells by ConA stimulation (12.Tachibana H. Kido I. Murakami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29061-29066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Tachibana H. Ushio Y. Chatchadaporn K. Shirahata S. J. Biol.

This finding is in contrast to reports stating that continuous novel light chain expression can occur in some sIg+ B cells in vitro and in vivo but not in Ig-secreting plasma cells (7.Gay D.

In the current study, we address the mechanism by which light chain shifting occurs in some human plasma cells. To elucidate the intracellular factors involved in light chain shifting, we tested agents that affect second messenger pathways, which can induce light chain shifting in the human plasma cell line HB4C5. Several agents that stimulate protein kinase C, increase intracellular cAMP and calcium, and inhibit protein kinase A did not mediate the induction of light chain shifting. We found that light chain shifting can be induced by caffeine. However, other agents that also can increase intracellular cAMP concentration, DbcAMP and forskolin, could not induce light chain shifting. Therefore, the induction of light chain shifting is thought to be independent of intracellular cAMP, and other effect(s) of caffeine should be considered to be responsible for the induction of the light chain shifting.Caffeine has pleiotoropic effects in mammalian cells, for example DNA intercalation and inhibiting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, cAMP phosphodiesterase, and serine/threonine phosphatases (29.Tornaletti S. Russo P. Parodi S. Pedrini A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30.Lock R.B. Galperina O.V. Feldhoff R.C. Rhodes L.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4933-4939PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Butcher R.W. Sutherland E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1244-1250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the possibility that the effect of caffeine on light chain shifting is due to the inhibition of phosphatase activity, HB4C5 cells were treated with okadaic acid, which is a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor (32.Thevenin C. Kim S.-J. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9363-9366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or vanadate, which is an inhibitor of dual specificity phosphatase and tyrosine phosphatase (33.Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid was able to induce secondary VJ rearrangement in the HB4C5 cells upon stimulation with a 1 nm dose, which is equivalent to IC50for type 2A and 4 serine/threonine phosphatase and much lower than type 1 and type 2B (39.Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar). Conversely, vanadate was less efficient for the induction of the VJ recombination. These results suggest that at least the inhibition of type 2A and/or type 4 serine/threonine protein phosphatase may play a role in the induction of light chain shifting. More study is necessary to elucidate how this inhibition affects light chain shifting in HB4C5 cells. The role of phosphorylation in the control of recombination has only been shown for the expression of RAG proteins, which are critical for initiating the V(D)J recombination (2.Oettinger M.A. Schatz D.G. Gorka C. Baltimore D. Science. 1990; 248: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). RAG-2 protein is marked for degradation upon phosphorylation by p34 cdc2 kinase (40.Lin W.C. Desiderio S. Science. 1993; 260: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It has been shown that p34 cdc2 kinase can be activated by caffeine (41.Hains J. Crompton N.E.A. Burkar W. Jaussi R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1507-1510PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Yao S.-L. Akhtar A.J. McKenna K.A. Bedi G.C. Sidransky D. Mabry M. Ravi R. Collector M.I. Jones R.J Sharkis S.J. Fuchs E.J. Bedi A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1140-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), suggesting that caffeine may act as an agent in the degradation pathway of RAG-2 protein. In fact, the expression of RAG proteins was not enhanced in the HB4C5 cells when stimulated with caffeine or okadaic acid. We have previously shown that the enhancement of RAG gene expression did not induce the light chain shifting (13.Tachibana H. Ushio Y. Chatchadaporn K. Shirahata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17404-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the induction of light chain shifting in plasma cells by caffeine is not due to an enhancement of the RAG gene expression.V(D)J recombination of the Ig genes is initiated by the RAG-1 and RAG-2 proteins, which recognize the recombination signal sequences that flank each V, D, and J segment, to introduce double-stranded DNA breaks between the gene segments and the recombination signal sequence, resulting in signal broken ends and coding broken ends (cutting phase). The joining of recombination signal sequence and coding ends relies on generally expressed cellular factors involved in DNA double-stranded break repair (43.Weaver D.T. Alt F.W. Nature. 1997; 388: 428-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). RAG gene expression and germ line transcription are thought to be sufficient enough for activating the cutting phase. Even though HB4C5 cells do produce the germ line transcript, the expression level of Vλ germ line transcript in HB4C5 cells did not change when stimulated with caffeine or okadaic acid. This suggests that the occurrence of secondary VλJλrearrangement in this plasma cell line is not a result of up-regulation of the Vλ germ line transcription. Although the level of RAG proteins and Vλ germ line transcript produced was not affected by the addition of caffeine or okadaic acid, the amount of signal broken end at the Vλ locus as a result of the action of a V(D)J recombinase clearly increased. This result suggests that the cutting phase in the rearrangement process can be activated by caffeine or okadaic acid, and the inability to rearrange the VλJλ region in HB4C5 cells in absence of these agents may be due the lack of formation of the VλSBE.These results demonstrate that factor(s) other than the RAG proteins and the up-regulation of germ line transcription may be involved in the induction of secondary VλJλ rearrangement by caffeine or okadaic acid. The recruitment process for the recombinase complex to the rearranging locus remains obscure (17.Constantinescu A. Schlissel M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). At least, the increase of Vλ SBE in HB4C5 cells cultured with caffeine or okadaic acid may reflect a recruitment of a recombinase complex to the Vλ locus. All known stimuli such as cAMP-raising agents, interleukin-4, and/or lipopolysaccharide, which trigger V(D)J rearrangement in pre-B and mature B cells, induce either RAG gene expression or germ line transcription (9.Papavasiliou F. Casellas R. Suh H. Qin X.-F. Besmer E. Pelanda R. Nemazee D. Rajewsky K. Nussenzweig M.C. Science. 1997; 278: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 10.Han S. Dillon S.R. Zheng B.

Kouskoff V. Nakamura T. Nemazee D. Nature. 1998; 394: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, caffeine may play a unique role in determining other aspects of the initiation mechanism for secondary VλJλrearrangement in human plasma cells.We observed that SBE is generated at elevated amounts after a 96-h stimulation time period with caffeine but was barely detected after 24 h. This time lag suggests that stimulation for over 24 h is needed before change of the chromatin structure at the light chain locus and/or V(D)J recombinase activation in HB4C5 cells can occur. This supports the hypothesis that activation of the recruitment process, which brings the recombinase complex to the Vλlocus, is regulated by as yet unknown additional factor(s) that may be up-regulated or activated by the phosphatase inhibitory effect of caffeine or okadaic acid. Determining such factor(s) will be informative in elucidating the regulation mechanism for the light chain shifting in human plasma cells.The observation that the amount of SBE induced by caffeine is almost equal to that induced by okadaic acid is not consistent with the observation that VλJλ coding joint formation induced by caffeine is at a much higher level than that by okadaic acid. This result suggests that the difference in VJ coding joint formation between caffeine and okadaic acid may be correlated with the difference in the activity for joining coding ends and may be mediated by an effect other than phosphatase inhibitory activity of caffeine. Immunoglobulin genes are assembled during B cell development through a series of site-specific recombination events collectively termed V(D)J recombination (1.Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The V(D)J recombination reaction is initiated by the recombination activating gene products RAG-1 and RAG-2 and is completed by a set of proteins employed in most cell types for DNA double-stranded break repair such as the Ku-80 antigen, a large catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase and XRCC4 (2.Oettinger M.A. Schatz D.G.

Although many of the VJ recombinations at the light chain loci occur in pre-B cells, recent findings suggest that light chain gene rearrangements often continue in immature-B cells and germinal center B cells (7.Gay D. Saunders T. Camper S. Weigert M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 8.Tiegs S. Russell D.M. Nemazee D. J. Exp.

We also have shown that secondary VJ recombination can occur in some human plasma cell lines when stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA)1(12.Tachibana H. Kido I. Murakami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29061-29066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Tachibana H. Ushio Y. Chatchadaporn K. Shirahata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17404-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We call this process light chain shifting (14.Tachibana H. Haruta H. Yamada K. Blood. 1999; 93: 198-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several factors have been shown to be involved in Ig gene rearrangement in terms of timing and placement (1.Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). V(D)J recombinase activity is determined by the regulated expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 (3.Schatz D.G. Oettinger M.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 59: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). These genes are expressed only when B cells rearrange the Ig heavy and light chain loci. The RAG gene products are necessary for Ig recombination, and coexpression of these two genes in nonlymphoid cells is sufficient to confer the ability to recombine artificial plasmid substrates (15.Yancopoulos G. Blackwell T. Suh H. Hood L. Alt F.W. Cell. 1986; 44: 251-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Secondary VJ rearrangements in immature B cells and our plasma B cells are closely correlated with coexpression of the two RAG genes (10.Han S. Dillon S.R. Zheng B. Shimoda M. Schlissel M.S. Kelsoe G. Science. 1997; 278: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 14.Tachibana H. Haruta H. Yamada K. Blood. 1999; 93: 198-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there must be additional levels of regulation to determine which loci are targeted for recombination in developing lymphocytes, because endogenous Ig genes are only targeted for complete rearrangement in B lineage cells, and endogenous T cell receptor genes are only completely rearranged in T lineage cells. Plus we have also found that enhancement of RAG expression is not sufficient to induce secondary VJ rearrangement in light chain shifting-inducible human plasma cells (13.Tachibana H. Ushio Y. Chatchadaporn K. Shirahata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17404-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 14.Tachibana H. Haruta H. Yamada K. Blood. 1999; 93: 198-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 is likely to be only part of the mechanism by which V(D)J recombination is activated in lymphoid cells. In lymphoid cells, specific developmental signals result in changes in the chromatin that allows the recombinase access to particular gene segments (16.Stanhope-Baker P. Hudson K.M. Shaffer A.L. Constantinescu A. Schlissel M.S. Cell. 1996; 85: 887-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 17.Constantinescu A. Schlissel M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Results showing that activation of a locus for rearrangement correlates with the transcription of that particular germ line locus support the accessibility hypothesis (18.Yancopoulos G.D Alt F.W. Cell. 1985; 40: 271-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 19.Schlissel M.S. Corcoran L.M. Baltimore D. J. Exp.

In this report, we investigated various intracellular factors that may induce light chain shifting in human plasma cells. We found that the RAG gene products and the transcription of the germ line locus is not sufficient to carry out secondary VJ recombination in human plasma cells. However, phosphatase inhibition by caffeine or okadaic acid was found to be necessary to induce secondary VJ recombination. The phosphatase inhibition induced the formation of signal broken-ended DNA intermediates in the cells, which is an initial step in the V(D)J recombination process. DISCUSSIONWe have previously found that the λ light chain replacement from an original to a novel chain can be induced in some human plasma cells by ConA stimulation (12.Tachibana H. Kido I.

In the current study, we address the mechanism by which light chain shifting occurs in some human plasma cells. To elucidate the intracellular factors involved in light chain shifting, we tested agents that affect second messenger pathways, which can induce light chain shifting in the human plasma cell line HB4C5. Several agents that stimulate protein kinase C, increase intracellular cAMP and calcium, and inhibit protein kinase A did not mediate the induction of light chain shifting. We found that light chain shifting can be induced by caffeine. However, other agents that also can increase intracellular cAMP concentration, DbcAMP and forskolin, could not induce light chain shifting. Therefore, the induction of light chain shifting is thought to be independent of intracellular cAMP, and other effect(s) of caffeine should be considered to be responsible for the induction of the light chain shifting.Caffeine has pleiotoropic effects in mammalian cells, for example DNA intercalation and inhibiting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, cAMP phosphodiesterase, and serine/threonine phosphatases (29.Tornaletti S.

To test the possibility that the effect of caffeine on light chain shifting is due to the inhibition of phosphatase activity, HB4C5 cells were treated with okadaic acid, which is a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor (32.Thevenin C. Kim S.-J. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9363-9366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or vanadate, which is an inhibitor of dual specificity phosphatase and tyrosine phosphatase (33.Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid was able to induce secondary VJ rearrangement in the HB4C5 cells upon stimulation with a 1 nm dose, which is equivalent to IC50for type 2A and 4 serine/threonine phosphatase and much lower than type 1 and type 2B (39.Hunter T.

These results suggest that at least the inhibition of type 2A and/or type 4 serine/threonine protein phosphatase may play a role in the induction of light chain shifting. More study is necessary to elucidate how this inhibition affects light chain shifting in HB4C5 cells. The role of phosphorylation in the control of recombination has only been shown for the expression of RAG proteins, which are critical for initiating the V(D)J recombination (2.Oettinger M.A. Schatz D.G. Gorka C. Baltimore D. Science. 1990; 248: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). RAG-2 protein is marked for degradation upon phosphorylation by p34 cdc2 kinase (40.Lin W.C.

Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1140-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), suggesting that caffeine may act as an agent in the degradation pathway of RAG-2 protein. In fact, the expression of RAG proteins was not enhanced in the HB4C5 cells when stimulated with caffeine or okadaic acid. We have previously shown that the enhancement of RAG gene expression did not induce the light chain shifting (13.Tachibana H. Ushio Y. Chatchadaporn K. Shirahata S. J. Biol.

Even though HB4C5 cells do produce the germ line transcript, the expression level of Vλ germ line transcript in HB4C5 cells did not change when stimulated with caffeine or okadaic acid. This suggests that the occurrence of secondary VλJλrearrangement in this plasma cell line is not a result of up-regulation of the Vλ germ line transcription. Although the level of RAG proteins and Vλ germ line transcript produced was not affected by the addition of caffeine or okadaic acid, the amount of signal broken end at the Vλ locus as a result of the action of a V(D)J recombinase clearly increased. This result suggests that the cutting phase in the rearrangement process can be activated by caffeine or okadaic acid, and the inability to rearrange the VλJλ region in HB4C5 cells in absence of these agents may be due the lack of formation of the VλSBE.These results demonstrate that factor(s) other than the RAG proteins and the up-regulation of germ line transcription may be involved in the induction of secondary VλJλ rearrangement by caffeine or okadaic acid.

In the current study, we address the mechanism by which light chain shifting occurs in some human plasma cells. To elucidate the intracellular factors involved in light chain shifting, we tested agents that affect second messenger pathways, which can induce light chain shifting in the human plasma cell line HB4C5. Several agents that stimulate protein kinase C, increase intracellular cAMP and calcium, and inhibit protein kinase A did not mediate the induction of light chain shifting. We found that light chain shifting can be induced by caffeine. However, other agents that also can increase intracellular cAMP concentration, DbcAMP and forskolin, could not induce light chain shifting. Therefore, the induction of light chain shifting is thought to be independent of intracellular cAMP, and other effect(s) of caffeine should be considered to be responsible for the induction of the light chain shifting. Caffeine has pleiotoropic effects in mammalian cells, for example DNA intercalation and inhibiting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, cAMP phosphodiesterase, and serine/threonine phosphatases (29.Tornaletti S. Russo P. Parodi S. Pedrini A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30.Lock R.B. Galperina O.V. Feldhoff R.C. Rhodes L.J.

To test the possibility that the effect of caffeine on light chain shifting is due to the inhibition of phosphatase activity, HB4C5 cells were treated with okadaic acid, which is a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor (32.Thevenin C. Kim S.-J. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9363-9366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or vanadate, which is an inhibitor of dual specificity phosphatase and tyrosine phosphatase (33.Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid was able to induce secondary VJ rearrangement in the HB4C5 cells upon stimulation with a 1 nm dose, which is equivalent to IC50for type 2A and 4 serine/threonine phosphatase and much lower than type 1 and type 2B (39.Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar). Conversely, vanadate was less efficient for the induction of the VJ recombination. These results suggest that at least the inhibition of type 2A and/or type 4 serine/threonine protein phosphatase may play a role in the induction of light chain shifting. More study is necessary to elucidate how this inhibition affects light chain shifting in HB4C5 cells. The role of phosphorylation in the control of recombination has only been shown for the expression of RAG proteins, which are critical for initiating the V(D)J recombination (2.Oettinger M.A. Schatz D.G. Gorka C. Baltimore D. Science. 1990; 248: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). RAG-2 protein is marked for degradation upon phosphorylation by p34 cdc2 kinase (40.Lin W.C. Desiderio S. Science. 1993; 260: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It has been shown that p34 cdc2 kinase can be activated by caffeine (41.Hains J. Crompton N.E.A. Burkar W. Jaussi R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1507-1510PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Yao S.-L. Akhtar A.J. McKenna K.A. Bedi G.C. Sidransky D. Mabry M. Ravi R. Collector M.I. Jones R.J Sharkis S.J. Fuchs E.J. Bedi A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1140-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), suggesting that caffeine may act as an agent in the degradation pathway of RAG-2 protein. In fact, the expression of RAG proteins was not enhanced in the HB4C5 cells when stimulated with caffeine or okadaic acid. We have previously shown that the enhancement of RAG gene expression did not induce the light chain shifting (13.Tachibana H. Ushio Y. Chatchadaporn K. Shirahata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17404-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the induction of light chain shifting in plasma cells by caffeine is not due to an enhancement of the RAG gene expression. V(D)J recombination of the Ig genes is initiated by the RAG-1 and RAG-2 proteins, which recognize the recombination signal sequences that flank each V, D, and J segment, to introduce double-stranded DNA breaks between the gene segments and the recombination signal sequence, resulting in signal broken ends and coding broken ends (cutting phase). The joining of recombination signal sequence and coding ends relies on generally expressed cellular factors involved in DNA double-stranded break repair (43.Weaver D.T. Alt F.W. Nature. 1997; 388: 428-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). RAG gene expression and germ line transcription are thought to be sufficient enough for activating the cutting phase. Even though HB4C5 cells do produce the germ line transcript, the expression level of Vλ germ line transcript in HB4C5 cells did not change when stimulated with caffeine or okadaic acid. This suggests that the occurrence of secondary VλJλrearrangement in this plasma cell line is not a result of up-regulation of the Vλ germ line transcription. Although the level of RAG proteins and Vλ germ line transcript produced was not affected by the addition of caffeine or okadaic acid, the amount of signal broken end at the Vλ locus as a result of the action of a V(D)J recombinase clearly increased. This result suggests that the cutting phase in the rearrangement process can be activated by caffeine or okadaic acid, and the inability to rearrange the VλJλ region in HB4C5 cells in absence of these agents may be due the lack of formation of the VλSBE. These results demonstrate that factor(s) other than the RAG proteins and the up-regulation of germ line transcription may be involved in the induction of secondary VλJλ rearrangement by caffeine or okadaic acid. The recruitment process for the recombinase complex to the rearranging locus remains obscure (17.Constantinescu A. Schlissel M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). At least, the increase of Vλ SBE in HB4C5 cells cultured with caffeine or okadaic acid may reflect a recruitment of a recombinase complex to the Vλ locus. All known stimuli such as cAMP-raising agents, interleukin-4, and/or lipopolysaccharide, which trigger V(D)J rearrangement in pre-B and mature B cells, induce either RAG gene expression or germ line transcription (9.Papavasiliou F. Casellas R. Suh H. Qin X.-F. Besmer E. Pelanda R. Nemazee D. Rajewsky K. Nussenzweig M.C. Science. 1997; 278: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 10.Han S. Dillon S.R. Zheng B.

Kouskoff V. Nakamura T. Nemazee D. Nature. 1998; 394: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, caffeine may play a unique role in determining other aspects of the initiation mechanism for secondary VλJλrearrangement in human plasma cells. We observed that SBE is generated at elevated amounts after a 96-h stimulation time period with caffeine but was barely detected after 24 h. This time lag suggests that stimulation for over 24 h is needed before change of the chromatin structure at the light chain locus and/or V(D)J recombinase activation in HB4C5 cells can occur. This supports the hypothesis that activation of the recruitment process, which brings the recombinase complex to the Vλlocus, is regulated by as yet unknown additional factor(s) that may be up-regulated or activated by the phosphatase inhibitory effect of caffeine or okadaic acid. Determining such factor(s) will be informative in elucidating the regulation mechanism for the light chain shifting in human plasma cells. The observation that the amount of SBE induced by caffeine is almost equal to that induced by okadaic acid is not consistent with the observation that VλJλ coding joint formation induced by caffeine is at a much higher level than that by okadaic acid. This result suggests that the difference in VJ coding joint formation between caffeine and okadaic acid may be correlated with the difference in the activity for joining coding ends and may be mediated by an effect other than phosphatase inhibitory activity of caffeine.
