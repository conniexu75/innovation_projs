https://openalex.org/W3211405363,"Bulk and single cell measurements are integrated to identify phenotype-associated subpopulations of cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) distinguishes cell types, states and lineages within the context of heterogeneous tissues. However, current single-cell data cannot directly link cell clusters with specific phenotypes. Here we present Scissor, a method that identifies cell subpopulations from single-cell data that are associated with a given phenotype. Scissor integrates phenotype-associated bulk expression data and single-cell data by first quantifying the similarity between each single cell and each bulk sample. It then optimizes a regression model on the correlation matrix with the sample phenotype to identify relevant subpopulations. Applied to a lung cancer scRNA-seq dataset, Scissor identified subsets of cells associated with worse survival and with TP53 mutations. In melanoma, Scissor discerned a T cell subpopulation with low PDCD1/CTLA4 and high TCF7 expression associated with an immunotherapy response. Beyond cancer, Scissor was effective in interpreting facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and Alzheimer’s disease datasets. Scissor identifies biologically and clinically relevant cell subpopulations from single-cell assays by leveraging phenotype and bulk-omics datasets."
https://openalex.org/W3212053680,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is rarely fatal in children and young people (CYP, <18 years old), but quantifying the risk of death is challenging because CYP are often infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibiting no or minimal symptoms. To distinguish between CYP who died as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection and those who died of another cause but were coincidentally infected with the virus, we undertook a clinical review of all CYP deaths with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test from March 2020 to February 2021. The predominant SARS-CoV-2 variants were wild-type and Alpha. Here we show that, of 12,023,568 CYP living in England, 3,105 died, including 61 who were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these deaths, 25 were due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (mortality rate, two per million), including 22 due to coronavirus disease 2019-the clinical disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection-and 3 were due to pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2. In total, 99.995% of CYP with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test survived. CYP older than 10 years, Asian and Black ethnic backgrounds and comorbidities were over-represented in SARS-CoV-2-related deaths compared with other CYP deaths. These results are important for guiding decisions on shielding and vaccinating children. New variants might have different mortality risks and should be evaluated in a similar way."
https://openalex.org/W3212458558,"The applicability of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) genotyping to inform enrollment of patients with cancer in clinical trials has not been established. We conducted a phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification prospectively confirmed by tumor tissue or ctDNA analysis ( UMIN000027887 ). HER2 amplification was confirmed in tissue and/or ctDNA in 30 patients with mCRC. The study met the primary endpoint with a confirmed objective response rate of 30% in 27 tissue-positive patients and 28% in 25 ctDNA-positive patients, as compared to an objective response rate of 0% in a matched real-world reference population treated with standard-of-care salvage therapy. Post hoc exploratory analyses revealed that baseline ctDNA genotyping of HER2 copy number and concurrent oncogenic alterations adjusted for tumor fraction stratified patients according to efficacy with similar accuracy to tissue genotyping. Decreased ctDNA fraction 3 weeks after treatment initiation associated with therapeutic response. Pertuzumab plus trastuzumab showed similar efficacy in patients with mCRC with HER2 amplification in tissue or ctDNA, showing that ctDNA genotyping can identify patients who benefit from dual-HER2 blockade as well as monitor treatment response. These findings warrant further use of ctDNA genotyping in clinical trials for HER2-amplified mCRC, which might especially benefit patients in first-line treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3214293964,"Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are retrograde neuromodulators with important functions in a wide range of physiological processes, but their in vivo dynamics remain largely uncharacterized. Here we developed a genetically encoded eCB sensor called GRABeCB2.0. GRABeCB2.0 consists of a circular-permutated EGFP and the human CB1 cannabinoid receptor, providing cell membrane trafficking, second-resolution kinetics with high specificity for eCBs, and shows a robust fluorescence response at physiological eCB concentrations. Using GRABeCB2.0, we monitored evoked and spontaneous changes in eCB dynamics in cultured neurons and acute brain slices. We observed spontaneous compartmentalized eCB transients in cultured neurons and eCB transients from single axonal boutons in acute brain slices, suggesting constrained, localized eCB signaling. When GRABeCB2.0 was expressed in the mouse brain, we observed foot shock-elicited and running-triggered eCB signaling in the basolateral amygdala and hippocampus, respectively. In a mouse model of epilepsy, we observed a spreading wave of eCB release that followed a Ca2+ wave through the hippocampus. GRABeCB2.0 is a robust probe for eCB release in vivo. A genetically encoded sensor reveals the dynamics of endocannabinoid signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3214448327,"Clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients vary greatly with age and underlying comorbidities. We aimed to determine the demographic and clinical factors, particularly baseline chronic conditions, associated with an increased risk of severity in COVID-19 patients from a population-based perspective and using data from electronic health records (EHR).Retrospective, observational study in an open cohort analyzing all 68,913 individuals (mean age 44.4 years, 53.2% women) with SARS-CoV-2 infection between 15 June and 19 December 2020 using exhaustive electronic health registries. Patients were followed for 30 days from inclusion or until the date of death within that period. We performed multivariate logistic regression to analyze the association between each chronic disease and severe infection, based on hospitalization and all-cause mortality.5885 (8.5%) individuals showed severe infection and old age was the most influencing factor. Congestive heart failure (odds ratio -OR- men: 1.28, OR women: 1.39), diabetes (1.37, 1.24), chronic renal failure (1.31, 1.22) and obesity (1.21, 1.26) increased the likelihood of severe infection in both sexes. Chronic skin ulcers (1.32), acute cerebrovascular disease (1.34), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.21), urinary incontinence (1.17) and neoplasms (1.26) in men, and infertility (1.87), obstructive sleep apnea (1.43), hepatic steatosis (1.43), rheumatoid arthritis (1.39) and menstrual disorders (1.18) in women were also associated with more severe outcomes.Age and specific cardiovascular and metabolic diseases increased the risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in men and women, whereas the effects of certain comorbidities are sex specific. Future studies in different settings are encouraged to analyze which profiles of chronic patients are at higher risk of poor prognosis and should therefore be the targets of prevention and shielding strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3212658374,"Patients diagnosed with cancer face many challenges and need a good understanding of their diagnosis and proposed treatments to make informed decisions about their care. Health literacy plays an important role in this and low health literacy has been associated with poorer outcomes. The aims of this review are to identify which outcomes relate to health literacy in patients with cancer, and to combine this through a mixed studies approach with the patient experience as described through qualitative studies.Four electronic databases were searched in January 2021 to identify records relating to health literacy and patients with cancer. Records were independently screened then assessed for inclusion by two reviewers according to the following criteria: patients aged ≥18 years with cancer, English language publication AND health literacy measured with validated tool and measured outcome associated with health literacy OR qualitative study exploring the role of health literacy as patients make decisions about health. Quality was independently assessed by two reviewers. A narrative synthesis was performed, and findings integrated through concept mapping. This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO, entry CRD42020166454.4441 records were retrieved. Following de-duplication, 2496 titles and abstracts were screened and full texts of 405 papers were reviewed for eligibility. 66 papers relating to 60 studies met the eligibility criteria. Lower health literacy was associated with greater difficulties understanding and processing cancer related information, poorer quality of life and poorer experience of care. Personal and situational influences contributed to how participants processed information and reached decisions about their care.This review highlights the important role of health literacy for patients with cancer. Outcomes are poorer for those who experience difficulties with health literacy. Further efforts should be made to facilitate understanding, develop health literacy and support patients to become more involved in their care."
https://openalex.org/W3212575075,"Functional neuroimaging has been a mainstay of human neuroscience for the past 25 years. Interpretation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has often occurred within knowledge frameworks crafted by experts, which have the potential to amplify biases that limit the replicability of findings. Here, we use a computational approach to derive a data-driven framework for neurobiological domains that synthesizes the texts and data of nearly 20,000 human neuroimaging articles. Across multiple levels of domain specificity, the structure-function links within domains better replicate in held-out articles than those mapped from dominant frameworks in neuroscience and psychiatry. We further show that the data-driven framework partitions the literature into modular subfields, for which domains serve as generalizable prototypes of structure-function patterns in single articles. The approach to computational ontology we present here is the most comprehensive characterization of human brain circuits quantifiable with fMRI and may be extended to synthesize other scientific literatures."
https://openalex.org/W3211354089,"En route from the retina to the cortex, visual information passes through the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus, where extensive corticothalamic (CT) feedback has been suggested to modulate spatial processing. How this modulation arises from direct excitatory and indirect inhibitory CT feedback pathways remains enigmatic. Here, we show that in awake mice, retinotopically organized cortical feedback sharpens receptive fields (RFs) and increases surround suppression in the dLGN. Guided by a network model indicating that widespread inhibitory CT feedback is necessary to reproduce these effects, we targeted the visual sector of the thalamic reticular nucleus (visTRN) for recordings. We found that visTRN neurons have large RFs, show little surround suppression and exhibit strong feedback-dependent responses to large stimuli. These features make them an ideal candidate for mediating feedback-enhanced surround suppression in the dLGN. We conclude that cortical feedback sculpts spatial integration in the dLGN, likely via recruitment of neurons in the visTRN."
https://openalex.org/W3213824376,"Anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs among parents can reduce vaccination intentions. Parents' beliefs in anti-vaccine conspiracy theories are also related to their perceptions of other parents' conspiracy beliefs. Further, research has shown that parents hold misperceptions of anti-vaccine conspiracy belief norms: UK parents over-estimate the anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs of other parents. The present study tested the effectiveness of a Social Norms Approach intervention, which corrects misperceptions using normative feedback, to reduce UK parents' anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs and increase vaccination intentions. At baseline, 202 UK parents of young children reported their personal belief in anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, future intentions to vaccinate, and their perceptions of other UK parents' beliefs and intentions. Participants were then randomly assigned to a normative feedback condition (n = 89) or an assessment-only control condition (n = 113). The normative feedback compared participants' personal anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs and perceptions of other UK parents' beliefs with actual normative belief levels. Parents receiving the normative feedback showed significantly reduced personal belief in anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs at immediate post-test. As hypothesised, changes in normative perceptions of anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs mediated the effect of the intervention. The intervention, did not directly increase vaccination intentions, however mediation analysis showed that the normative feedback increased perceptions of other parents' vaccination intentions, which in turn increased personal vaccination intentions. No significant effects remained after a six-week follow-up. The current research demonstrates the potential utility of Social Norms Approach interventions for correcting misperceptions and reducing anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs among UK parents. Further research could explore utilising a top-up intervention to maintain the efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3212483055,"Blood banks around the world store blood components for several weeks ensuring its availability for transfusion medicine. Red blood cells (RBCs) are known to undergo compositional changes during storage, which may impact the cells' function and eventually the recipients' health. We extracted the RBC's cytoplasmic membrane (RBCcm) to study the effect of storage on the membranes' molecular structure and bending rigidity by a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray diffuse scattering (XDS) and coarse grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Blood was stored in commercial blood bags for 2 and 5 weeks, respectively and compared to freshly drawn blood. Using mass spectrometry, we measured an increase of fatty acids together with a slight shift towards shorter tail lengths. We observe an increased fraction (6%) of liquid ordered (lo) domains in the RBCcms with storage time, and an increased lipid packing in these domains, leading to an increased membrane thickness and membrane order. The size of both, lo and liquid disordered (ld) lipid domains was found to decrease with increased storage time by up to 25%. XDS experiments reveal a storage dependent increase in the RBCcm's bending modulus κ by a factor of 2.8, from 1.9 kBT to 5.3 kBT. MD simulations were conducted in the absence of proteins. The results show that the membrane composition has a small contribution to the increased bending rigidity and suggests additional protein-driven mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W3211521906,"Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) converts nicotinamide to NAD+. As low hepatic NAD+ levels have been linked to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, we hypothesized that ablation of hepatic Nampt would affect susceptibility to liver injury in response to diet-induced metabolic stress. Following 3 weeks on a low-methionine and choline-free 60% high-fat diet, hepatocyte-specific Nampt knockout (HNKO) mice accumulated less triglyceride than WT littermates but had increased histological scores for liver inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis. Surprisingly, liver injury was also observed in HNKO mice on the purified control diet. This HNKO phenotype was associated with decreased abundance of mitochondrial proteins, especially proteins involved in oxidoreductase activity. High-resolution respirometry revealed lower respiratory capacity in purified control diet-fed HNKO liver. In addition, fibrotic area in HNKO liver sections correlated negatively with hepatic NAD+, and liver injury was prevented by supplementation with NAD+ precursors nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid. MS-based proteomic analysis revealed that nicotinamide riboside supplementation rescued hepatic levels of oxidoreductase and OXPHOS proteins. Finally, single-nucleus RNA-Seq showed that transcriptional changes in the HNKO liver mainly occurred in hepatocytes, and changes in the hepatocyte transcriptome were associated with liver necrosis. In conclusion, HNKO livers have reduced respiratory capacity, decreased abundance of mitochondrial proteins, and are susceptible to fibrosis because of low NAD+ levels. Our data suggest a critical threshold level of hepatic NAD+ that determines the predisposition to liver injury and supports that NAD+ precursor supplementation can prevent liver injury and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W3211911662,"The rotenone-induced animal model of Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been used to investigate the pathogenesis of PD. Oxidative stress is one of the main contributors of neurodegeneration in PD. Flavonoids have the potential to modulate neuronal function and combat various neurodegenerative diseases. The pre- and post-supplementation of quercetin (50 mg/kg, p.o) was done in rats injected with rotenone (1.5 mg/kg, s.c). After the treatment, behavioral activities were monitored for motor activity, depression-like behavior, and cognitive changes. Rats were decapitated after behavioral analysis and the brain samples were dissected out for neurochemical and biochemical estimation. Results showed that supplementation of quercetin significantly ( p &lt;0.01) restored rotenone-induced motor and non-motor deficits (depression and cognitive impairments), enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities ( p &lt;0.01), and attenuated neurotransmitter alterations ( p &lt;0.01). It is suggested that quercetin supplementation improves neurotransmitter levels by mitigating oxidative stress via increasing antioxidant enzyme activity and hence improves motor activity, cognitive functions, and reduces depressive behavior. The results of the present study showed that quercetin pre-supplementation produced more significant results as compared to post-supplementation. These findings show that quercetin can be a potential therapeutic agent to reduce the risk and progression of PD."
https://openalex.org/W3212317475,"Most lectins bind carbohydrate ligands with relatively low affinity, making the identification of optimal ligands challenging. Here we introduce a point accumulation in nanoscale topography (PAINT) super-resolution microscopy method to capture weak glycan-lectin interactions at the single-molecule level in living cells (Glyco-PAINT). Glyco-PAINT exploits weak and reversible sugar binding to directly achieve single-molecule detection and quantification in cells and is used to establish the relative kon and koff rates of a synthesized library of carbohydrate-based probes, as well as the diffusion coefficient of the receptor-sugar complex. Uptake of ligands correlates with their binding affinity and residence time to establish structure-function relations for various synthetic glycans. We reveal how sugar multivalency and presentation geometry can be optimized for binding and internalization. Overall, Glyco-PAINT represents a powerful approach to study weak glycan-lectin interactions on the surface of living cells, one that can be potentially extended to a variety of lectin-sugar interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3213316242,"Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and cause substantial economic burden. Blended cognitive-behavioural therapy (bCBT), which integrates Internet-based CBT and face-to-face CBT (ftfCBT), is an attractive and potentially cost-saving treatment alternative to conventional CBT for patients with anxiety disorders in specialised mental health care. However, little is known about the effectiveness of bCBT in routine care. We examined the acceptability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of bCBT versus ftfCBT in outpatient specialised care to patients with panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and generalised anxiety disorder.Patients with anxiety disorders were randomised to bCBT (n = 52) or ftfCBT (n = 62). Acceptability of bCBT and ftfCBT were evaluated by assessing treatment preference, adherence, satisfaction and therapeutic alliance. Costs and effects were assessed at post-treatment and one-year follow-up. Primary outcome measure was the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, general psychopathology, work and social adjustment, quality of life and mastery. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were computed from societal and healthcare perspectives by calculating the incremental costs per incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY). No significant differences between bCBT and ftfCBT were found on acceptability or effectiveness measures at post-treatment (Cohen's d between-group effect size on BAI = 0.15, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.60) or at one-year follow-up (d = -0.38, 95% CI -0.84 to 0.09). The modelled point estimates of societal costs (bCBT €10945, ftfCBT €10937) were higher and modelled point estimates of direct medical costs (bCBT €3748, ftfCBT €3841) were lower in bCBT. The acceptability curves showed that bCBT was expected to be a cost-effective intervention. Results should be carefully interpreted due to the small sample size.bCBT appears an acceptable, clinically effective and potentially cost-saving alternative option for treating patients with anxiety disorders. Trials with larger samples are needed to further investigate cost-effectiveness.Netherlands Trial Register: NTR4912."

https://openalex.org/W3211547248,"Reduced cerebrovascular compliance is the major mechanism of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) also promotes SVD development, but the underlying mechanism was not elucidated. We investigated the association among OSA, cerebrovascular compliance, and SVD parameters. This study retrospectively included individuals ≥ 50 years of age, underwent overnight polysomnographic (PSG) for the evaluation of OSA, and performed MRI and transcranial Doppler (TCD) within 12 months of interval without a neurological event between the evaluations. TCD parameters for the cerebrovascular compliance included middle cerebral artery pulsatility index (MCA PI) and mean MCA resistance index ratio (MRIR). SVD parameters included white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, number of lacunes, enlarged perivascular space (ePVS) score, and the presence of microbleeds or lacunes. Ninety-seven individuals (60.8% male, mean age 70.0±10.5 years) were included. MRIR was associated with higher respiratory distress index (B = 0.003; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.001-0.005; P = 0.021), while MCA PI was not associated with any of the PSG markers for OSA severity. Apnea-hypopnea index was associated with the log-transformed total WMH volume (B = 0.008; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.001-0.016; P = 0.020), subcortical WMH volume (B = 0.015; 95% CI 0.007-0.022; P<0.001), total ePVS score (B = 0.024; 95% CI 0.003-0.045; P = 0.026), and centrum semiovale ePVS score (B = 0.026; 95% CI 0.004-0.048; P = 0.019), and oxygen-desaturation index with periventricular WMH volume, independently from age, MCA PI, and MRIR. This study concluded that OSA is associated with reduced cerebrovascular compliance and also with SVD independently from cerebrovascular compliance. Underlying pathomechanistic link might be region specific."
https://openalex.org/W3214131100,"ER-to-Golgi transport is the first step in the constitutive secretory pathway, which, unlike regulated secretion, is believed to proceed nonstop independent of Ca2+ flux. However, here we demonstrate that penta-EF hand (PEF) proteins ALG-2 and peflin constitute a hetero-bifunctional COPII regulator that responds to Ca2+ signaling by adopting one of several distinct activity states. Functionally, these states can adjust the rate of ER export of COPII-sorted cargos up or down by ∼50%. We found that at steady-state Ca2+, ALG-2/peflin hetero-complexes bind to ER exit sites (ERES) through the ALG-2 subunit to confer a low, buffered secretion rate, while peflin-lacking ALG-2 complexes markedly stimulate secretion. Upon Ca2+ signaling, ALG-2 complexes lacking peflin can either increase or decrease the secretion rate depending on signaling intensity and duration-phenomena that could contribute to cellular growth and intercellular communication following secretory increases or protection from excitotoxicity and infection following decreases. In epithelial normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, the Ca2+-mobilizing agonist ATP causes ALG-2 to depress ER export, while in neuroendocrine PC12 cells, Ca2+ mobilization by ATP results in ALG-2-dependent enhancement of secretion. Furthermore, distinct Ca2+ signaling patterns in NRK cells produce opposing ALG-2-dependent effects on secretion. Mechanistically, ALG-2-dependent depression of secretion involves decreased levels of the COPII outer shell and increased peflin targeting to ERES, while ALG-2-dependent enhancement of secretion involves increased COPII outer shell and decreased peflin at ERES. These data provide insights into how PEF protein dynamics affect secretion of important physiological cargoes such as collagen I and significantly impact ER stress."
https://openalex.org/W3212386739,"Branching enzymes (BEs) are essential in the biosynthesis of starch and glycogen and play critical roles in determining the fine structure of these polymers. The substrates of these BEs are long carbohydrate chains that interact with these enzymes via multiple binding sites on the enzyme's surface. By controlling the branched-chain length distribution, BEs can mediate the physiological properties of starch and glycogen moieties; however, the mechanism and structural determinants of this specificity remain mysterious. In this study, we identify a large dodecaose binding surface on rice BE I (BEI) that reaches from the outside of the active site to the active site of the enzyme. Mutagenesis activity assays confirm the importance of this binding site in enzyme catalysis, from which we conclude that it is likely the acceptor chain binding site. Comparison of the structures of BE from Cyanothece and BE1 from rice allowed us to model the location of the donor-binding site. We also identified two loops that likely interact with the donor chain and whose sequences diverge between plant BE1, which tends to transfer longer chains, and BEIIb, which transfers exclusively much shorter chains. When the sequences of these loops were swapped with the BEIIb sequence, rice BE1 also became a short-chain transferring enzyme, demonstrating the key role these loops play in specificity. Taken together, these results provide a more complete picture of the structure, selectivity, and activity of BEs."
https://openalex.org/W3213373001,"Placental malaria infection is mediated by the binding of the malarial VAR2CSA protein to the placental glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate. Recombinant subfragments of VAR2CSA (rVAR2) have also been shown to bind specifically and with high affinity to cancer cells and tissues, suggesting the presence of a shared type of oncofetal chondroitin sulfate (ofCS) in the placenta and in tumors. However, the exact structure of ofCS and what determines the selective tropism of VAR2CSA remains poorly understood. In this study, ofCS was purified by affinity chromatography using rVAR2 and subjected to detailed structural analysis. We found high levels of N-acetylgalactosamine 4-O-sulfation (∼80-85%) in placenta- and tumor-derived ofCS. This level of 4-O-sulfation was also found in other tissues that do not support parasite sequestration, suggesting that VAR2CSA tropism is not exclusively determined by placenta- and tumor-specific sulfation. Here, we show that both placenta and tumors contain significantly more chondroitin sulfate moieties of higher molecular weight than other tissues. In line with this, CHPF and CHPF2, which encode proteins required for chondroitin polymerization, are significantly upregulated in most cancer types. CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of CHPF and CHPF2 in tumor cells reduced the average molecular weight of cell-surface chondroitin sulfate and resulted in a marked reduction of rVAR2 binding. Finally, utilizing a cell-based glycocalyx model, we showed that rVAR2 binding correlates with the length of the chondroitin sulfate chains in the cellular glycocalyx. These data demonstrate that the total amount and cellular accessibility of chondroitin sulfate chains impact rVAR2 binding and thus malaria infection."

https://openalex.org/W3211589894,"Aberrant expressions of apoptotic genes have been associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in the past, however, their prognostic role and utility as biomarkers remains poorly understood. In this study, we analysed 505 PTC patients by employing Cox-PH regression techniques, prognostic index models and machine learning methods to elucidate the relationship between overall survival (OS) of PTC patients and 165 apoptosis related genes. It was observed that nine genes (ANXA1, TGFBR3, CLU, PSEN1, TNFRSF12A, GPX4, TIMP3, LEF1, BNIP3L) showed significant association with OS of PTC patients. Five out of nine genes were found to be positively correlated with OS of the patients, while the remaining four genes were negatively correlated. These genes were used for developing risk prediction models, which can be utilized to classify patients with a higher risk of death from the patients which have a good prognosis. Our voting-based model achieved highest performance (HR = 41.59, p = 3.36x10-4, C = 0.84, logrank-p = 3.8x10-8). The performance of voting-based model improved significantly when we used the age of patients with prognostic biomarker genes and achieved HR = 57.04 with p = 10-4 (C = 0.88, logrank-p = 1.44x10-9). We also developed classification models that can classify high risk patients (survival ≤ 6 years) and low risk patients (survival > 6 years). Our best model achieved AUROC of 0.92. Further, the expression pattern of the prognostic genes was verified at mRNA level, which showed their differential expression between normal and PTC samples. Also, the immunostaining results from HPA validated these findings. Since these genes can also be used as potential therapeutic targets in PTC, we also identified potential drug molecules which could modulate their expression profile. The study briefly revealed the key prognostic biomarker genes in the apoptotic pathway whose altered expression is associated with PTC progression and aggressiveness. In addition to this, risk assessment models proposed here can help in efficient management of PTC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3212598774,"Wheat has a remarkable importance among cereals worldwide. Wheat stem and leaf rust constitute the main threats that destructively influence grain quality and yield production. Pursuing resistant cultivars and developing new genotypes including resistance genes is believed to be the most effective tool to overcome these challenges. This study is the first to use molecular markers to evaluate the genetic diversity of eighteen Egyptian wheat genotypes. Moreover, the molecular docking analysis was also used to assess the Cu-chitosan nanoparticle (CuChNp) treatment and its mode of action in disease control management. The tested genotypes were categorized into two main cluster groups depending on the similarity matrix, i.e the most resistant and susceptible genotypes to stem and leaf rust races. The results of SCoT primers revealed 140 polymorphic and 5 monomorphic bands with 97% polymorphism. While 121 polymorphic and 74 monomorphic bands were scored for SRAP primers (99% polymorphism). The genotypes Sakha 94, Sakha 95, Beni Sweif 4, Beni Sweif 7, Sohag 4 and Sohag 5 were resistant, while Giza 160 was highly susceptible to all stem rust races at the seedling stage. However, in the adult stage, the 18 genotypes were evaluated for stem and leaf rust-resistant in two different locations, i.e. Giza and Sids. In this investigation, for the first time, the activity of CuChNp was studied and shown to have the potential to inhibit stem and leaf rust in studied Egyptian wheat genotypes. The Spraying Cu-chitosan nanoparticles showed that the incubation and latent periods were increased in treated plants of the tested genotypes. Molecular modeling revealed their activity against the stem and leaf rust development. The SRAP and SCoT markers were highly useful tools for the classification of the tested wheat genotypes, although they displayed high similarities at the morphological stage. However, Cu-chitosan nanoparticles have a critical and effective role in stem and leaf rust disease control."

The training and testing experiments of the algorithm are conducted by using the UCI imbalanced datasets, and the established composite metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and other algorithms in comprehensive evaluation method. The results show that the proposed algorithm makes the multi-class imbalanced data balanced in terms of quantity, and the newly generated data maintain the distribution characteristics and information properties of the original samples. Moreover, compared with other algorithms such as SMOTE and SVMOM, the proposed algorithm has reached a higher classification accuracy of about 90%. It is concluded that this algorithm has high practicability and general characteristics for imbalanced multi-class samples."

Apart from the national demographic and health survey, which is carried out every 5 years, there have not been enough documented studies on child breastfeeding and weaning practices of caregivers in the Volta Region. We, therefore, examined child breastfeeding and weaning practices of mothers in the Volta Region of Ghana.A sub-national survey method was adopted and a semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 396 mothers and their children. Descriptive and inferential statistics comprising frequency, percentage, chi-square, and logistic regression were employed in analysing the data. We defined exclusive breastfeeding as given only breast milk to an infant from a mother or a wet nurse for six months of life except drops or syrups consisting of vitamins, minerals, supplements, or medicines on medical advice, and prolonged breastfeeding as breastfeeding up to 24 months of age.The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) was 43.7%. Mothers constituting 61.1% started breastfeeding within an hour of giving birth. In addition to breast milk, 5.1% gave fluids to their children on the first day of birth. About 66.4% started complementary feeding at 6 months, 22.0% breastfed for 24 months or beyond, while 40.4% fed their children on-demand. Child's age (AOR: 0.23, 95% CI:0.12-0.43, p<0.0001), prolonged breastfeeding (AOR: 0.41, 95%CI: 0.12-0.87, p = 0.001), mother's religion (AOR: 3.92, 95%CI: 1.23-12.61, p = 0.021), feeding practices counselled on (AOR: 1.72, 95%CI: 1.96-3.09, p = 0.023), mother ever heard about EBF (AOR: 0.43, 95%CI: 1.45-2.41, p = 0.039), child being fed from the bottle with a nipple (AOR: 1.53, 95%CI: 1.94-2.48, p = 0.003), and age at which complementary feeding was started (AOR: 17.43, 95%CI: 3.47-87.55, p = 0.008) were statistically associated with EBF.Breastfeeding education has been ongoing for decades, yet there are still gaps in the breastfeeding practices of mothers. To accelerate progress towards attainment of the sustainable development goal 3 of ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages by the year 2030, we recommend innovative policies that include extensive public education to improve upon the breastfeeding and weaning practices of mothers."

The receipt of RBCT post-transplant (468 participants transfused, total 2,373 RBCT) was analyzed as a time-varying, cumulative exposure. Adjusted cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for outcomes of bacterial or viral (BK or CMV) infection.Over a median follow-up of 3.8 years, bacterial infection occurred in 34% of participants at a median of 409 days post-transplant and viral infection occurred in 25% at a median of 154 days post-transplant. Transfusion was associated with a step-wise higher risk of bacterial infection (HR 1.35, 95%CI 0.95-1.91; HR 1.29, 95%CI 0.92-1.82; HR 2.63, 95%CI 1.94-3.56; HR 3.38, 95%CI 2.30-4.95, for 1, 2, 3-5 and >5 RBCT respectively), but not viral infection. These findings were consistent in multiple additional analyses, including accounting for reverse causality.Blood transfusion after kidney transplant is associated with a higher risk for bacterial infection, emphasizing the need to use transfusions judiciously in this population already at risk for infections."
https://openalex.org/W3212806429,"Importin α1/KPNA1 is a member of the Importin α family widely present in the mammalian brain and has been characterized as a regulator of neuronal differentiation, synaptic functionality, and anxiety-like behavior. In humans, a de novo mutation of the KPNA1 (human Importin α5) gene has been linked with schizophrenia; however, the precise roles of KPNA1 in disorder-related behaviors are still unknown. Moreover, as recent studies have highlighted the importance of gene-environment interactions in the development of psychiatric disorders, we investigated the effects of Kpna1 deletion and social isolation stress, a paradigm that models social stress factors found in human patients, on psychiatric disorder-related behaviors in mice. Through assessment in a behavioral battery, we found that Kpna1 knockout resulted in the following behavioral phenotype: (1) decreased anxiety-like behavior in an elevated plus maze test, (2) short term memory deficits in novel object recognition test (3) impaired sensorimotor gating in a prepulse inhibition test. Importantly, exposure to social isolation stress resulted in additional behavioral abnormalities where isolated Kpna1 knockout mice exhibited: (1) impaired aversive learning and/or memory in the inhibitory avoidance test, as well as (2) increased depression-like behavior in the forced swim test. Furthermore, we investigated whether mice showed alterations in plasma levels of stress-associated signal molecules (corticosterone, cytokines, hormones, receptors), and found that Kpna1 knockout significantly altered levels of corticosterone and LIX (CXCL5). Moreover, significant decreases in the level of prolactin were found in all groups except for group-housed wild type mice. Our findings demonstrate that Kpna1 deletion can trigger widespread behavioral abnormalities associated with psychiatric disorders, some of which were further exacerbated by exposure to adolescent social isolation. The use of Kpna1 knockout mice as a model for psychiatric disorders may show promise for further investigation of gene-environment interactions involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3213477875,"In recent decades, microfinance institutions with financial products designed for low income groups have been established all over the world. However, credit access for farmers in developing countries remains low. Digital financial services are rapidly expanding globally at the moment. They also bear great potential to address the credit needs of farmers in remote rural areas. Beyond mobile money services, digital credit is successively offered and also discussed in literature. Compared to conventional credit which is granted based on a thorough assessment of the loan applicant's financial situation, digital credit is granted based on an automated analysis of the existing data of the loan applicant. Despite the potential of digital credit for serving the credit needs of rural farmers, empirical research on farmers' willingness to pay for digital credit is non-existent. We employ a discrete choice experiment to compare farmers' willingness to pay for digital and conventional credit. We apply loan attributes which reflect typical characteristics of both credit products. Our results indicate a higher willingness to pay for digital credit compared to conventional credit. Furthermore, we find that the proximity to withdraw borrowed money has a higher effect on farmers' willingness to pay for digital credit compared to conventional credit. Furthermore, our results show that instalment repayment condition reduces farmers' willingness to pay for digital credit whilst increasing their willingness to pay for conventional credit. Additionally, we find that longer loan duration has a higher effect on farmers' willingness to pay for digital credit compared to conventional credit whereas higher additional credit cost has a lower effect on farmers' willingness to pay for conventional credit compared to digital credit. Our results highlight the potential of digital credit for agricultural finance in rural areas of Madagascar if a certain level of innovation is applied in designing digital credit products."
https://openalex.org/W3214035661,"DNA conservation is central to many applications. This leads to an ever-increasing number of samples which are more and more difficult and costly to store or transport. A way to alleviate this problem is to develop procedures for storing samples at room temperature while maintaining their stability. A variety of commercial systems have been proposed but they fail to completely protect DNA from deleterious factors, mainly water. On the other side, Imagene company has developed a procedure for long-term conservation of biospecimen at room temperature based on the confinement of the samples under an anhydrous and anoxic atmosphere maintained inside hermetic capsules. The procedure has been validated by us and others for purified RNA, and for DNA in buffy coat or white blood cells lysates, but a precise determination of purified DNA stability is still lacking. We used the Arrhenius law to determine the DNA degradation rate at room temperature. We found that extrapolation to 25°C gave a degradation rate constant equivalent to about 1 cut/century/100 000 nucleotides, a stability several orders of magnitude larger than the current commercialized processes. Such a stability is fundamental for many applications such as the preservation of very large DNA molecules (particularly interesting in the context of genome sequencing) or oligonucleotides for DNA data storage. Capsules are also well suited for this latter application because of their high capacity. One can calculate that the 64 zettabytes of data produced in 2020 could be stored, standalone, for centuries, in about 20 kg of capsules."
https://openalex.org/W3211963649,"Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) has a wide spectrum of illnesses depending on the progression of the disease and comorbid conditions. However, there is an inadequacy of investigations regarding clinical, laboratory, risk factor and prognostic data on CPA. The current study is aimed to consider the clinical manifestations, risk factors and outcomes of CPA.Retrospective records of all patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CPA who sought treatment at Gulab Devi Chest Hospital Lahore, Pakistan from January 2017 to December 2019 were evaluated. Data regarding demographics, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, radiographic and microbiological findings, length of hospital stay (LOS) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission was collected and analyzed to identify the factors associated with mortality. The independent factors associated with mortality were also identified by appropriate analyses.A total of 218 CPA patients were included in this study. The mean age was 45.75 ± 6.26 years. Of these, 160 (73.4%) were male, and 65 (29.8%) had diabetes. The mean LOS was 18.5 ± 10.9 days. The most common type of CPA was simple aspergilloma (56%) followed by chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (CCPA) (31.2%). About one half of the patients had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and treatment response rates were low in patients with active TB. The overall mortality rate was 27.1%. ICU admission was required for 78 (35.8%) patients. Diabetes mellitus (DM), hematological malignancies and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were the common underlying conditions predicting a poor outcome. Mean LOS, hematological malignancies, consolidation and ICU admission were identified as the independent factors leading to mortality.CPA had a significant association with TB in the majority of cases. Treatment response rates in cases with active TB were comparatively low. Cases with high mean LOS, hematological malignancies, consolidation, ICU admission, CKD and DM experienced poor outcomes. High mean LOS, hematological malignancies, consolidation and ICU stay were identified as independent risk factors for mortality. Future large prospective studies, involving aspergillus specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody testing, are required for a better understanding of CPA in Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W3212019831,"The NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical component of sterile inflammation, which is involved in many diseases. However, there is currently no known proximal biomarker for measuring NLRP3 activation in pathological conditions. Protein kinase D (PKD) has emerged as an important NLRP3 kinase that catalyzes the release of a phosphorylated NLRP3 species that is competent for inflammasome complex assembly.To explore the potential for PKD activation to serve as a selective biomarker of the NLRP3 pathway, we tested various stimulatory conditions in THP-1 and U937 cell lines, probing the inflammasome space beyond NLRP3. We analyzed the correlation between PKD activation (monitored by its auto-phosphorylation) and functional inflammasome readouts.PKD activation/auto-phosphorylation always preceded cleavage of caspase-1 and gasdermin D, and treatment with the PKD inhibitor CRT0066101 could block NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and interleukin-1β production. Conversely, blocking NLRP3 either genetically or using the MCC950 inhibitor prevented PKD auto-phosphorylation, indicating a bidirectional functional crosstalk between NLRP3 and PKD. Further assessments of the pyrin and NLRC4 pathways, however, revealed that PKD auto-phosphorylation can be triggered by a broad range of stimuli unrelated to NLRP3 inflammasome assembly.Although PKD and NLRP3 become functionally interconnected during NLRP3 activation, the promiscuous reactivity of PKD challenges its potential use for tracing the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway."

Regression models were estimated to explore associations between individual, household and community characteristics and these aspirations for all adolescents and separately for younger (10-14 years) and older (15-19 years) girls. Age, school attendance, and self-efficacy, as well as household wealth, caste/ethnicity, size, and agro-ecological zone of residence were significantly associated with aspirations, although effect sizes and significance varied by aspiration domain and age group.Findings underscore the curtailing effect of poverty on aspirations and the dynamic nature of aspirations.

https://openalex.org/W3214722629,"Purpose To investigate the relationship between disruption in different photoreceptor layers and deep capillary plexus (DCP) telangiectasias in eyes with macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel). Methods 35 eyes (21 patients) with MacTel imaged with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) were included. Circumscribed areas of DCP telangiectasia were traced from OCTA slabs and the corresponding spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) slabs were used to visualize the photoreceptor layer interdigitation zone (IZ) and ellipsoid zone (EZ). IZ attenuation, IZ loss, and EZ loss were graded by reviewing en face SD-OCT slabs for hypo-reflective areas and confirming their status on cross-sectional views. Total area of photoreceptor disruption and overlap with DCP telangiectasia were evaluated with respect to OCT-based MacTel stage. Longitudinal changes were evaluated in a subset of patients with follow-up imaging. Results Overlap of DCP telangiectasia with IZ attenuation significantly decreased with MacTel severity, while overlap with IZ and EZ loss significantly increased. Overlap with IZ loss peaked in moderate MacTel (Stages 3–5). Longitudinal imaging showed that new EZ loss at 6 months was largely predicted by baseline IZ loss. Conclusions Worsening MacTel severity is characterized by greater overlap between DCP telangiectasia and zones of increasing severity of photoreceptor disruption, with EZ loss enlarging over time within areas of preexisting IZ disruption. We suggest that IZ disruption may indicate early photoreceptor dysfunction that eventually progresses to EZ loss, with IZ loss being a more reliable metric than IZ attenuation. Additional studies will be necessary to further explore long-term photoreceptor changes and evaluate their relationship with visual function in MacTel."

We conducted a cross-sectional survey among pregnant women enrolling in a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) implementation study to determine the prevalence and factors associated with pregnancy self-testing among women in western Kenya. Overall, in our study population, 17% of women obtained a pregnancy self-test from a pharmacy. Pregnancy test use was higher among employed women, women with secondary and college-level educated partners, and women who spent 30 minutes or less traveling to the maternal and child health (MCH) clinic. The most reported reasons for non-use of pregnancy self-tests included not thinking it was necessary, lack of knowledge, and money to pay for the test. Future research should focus on understanding the knowledge and attitudes of women toward pregnancy self-testing as well as developing community-based models to improve access to pregnancy testing and ANC."
https://openalex.org/W3212018020,"Antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern. The shrinking selection of effective antibiotics and lack of new development is making the situation worse. Gram-negative bacteria more specifically pose serious threat because of their double layered cell envelope and effective efflux systems, which is a challenge for drugs to penetrate. One promising approach to breach this barrier is the ""Trojan horse strategy"". In this technique, an antibiotic molecule is conjugated with a nutrient molecule that helps the antibiotic to enter the cell through dedicated transporters for the nutrient. Here, we explored the approach using biotin conjugation with a florescent molecule Atto565 to determine if biotinylation enhances accumulation. Biotin is an essential vitamin for bacteria and is obtained through either synthesis or uptake from the environment. We found that biotinylation enhanced accumulation of Atto565 in E. coli. However, the enhancement did not seem to be due to uptake through biotin transporters since the presence of free biotin had no observable impact on accumulation. Accumulated compound was mostly in the periplasm, as determined by cell fractionation studies. This was further confirmed through the observation that expression of streptavidin in the periplasm specifically enhanced the accumulation of biotinylated Atto565. This enhancement was not observed when streptavidin was expressed in the cytoplasm indicating no significant distribution of the compound inside the cytoplasm. Using gene knockout strains, plasmid complementation and mutagenesis studies we demonstrated that biotinylation made the compound a better passenger through OmpC, an outer membrane porin. Density functional theory (DFT)-based evaluation of the three-dimensional geometries showed that biotinylation did not directly stabilize the conformation of the compound to make it favorable for the entry through a pore. Further studies including molecular dynamics simulations are necessary to determine the possible mechanisms of enhanced accumulation of the biotinylated Atto565."
https://openalex.org/W3212880464,"Serodiagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) can be rapid, reliable and cost-effective if the issue of variable antibody responses of TB patients against different Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) antigens can be overcome by developing fusion proteins containing epitopes from multiple antigens of Mtb . In this study, Mtb antigens Rv1793, Rv2628, Rv2608 and a truncated variant produced by removing non-epitopic region from N-terminal of Rv2608 (tnRv2608), and the fusion protein Rv1793-Rv2628-tnRv2608 (TriFu64), were expressed in E . coli and purified. Plasma samples from TB patients characterized by sex, age and sputum/culture positivity, were used to compare the sensitivity of the single antigens with the fusion protein. Sensitivity of Rv1793, Rv2628 and Rv2608, was 27.8%, 39% and 36.3%, respectively. Truncation of Rv2608 increased sensitivity by approximately 35% in confirmed TB cases. Sensitivity of the fusion construct, TriFu64 increased to 66% with a specificity of 100%. Importantly, tnRv2608 was better able to detect sputum and culture negative patients, and this carried through to the fusion protein. We demonstrate that fusion of Mtb proteins ensures broad sensitivity across disease types, sex and age groups in a Pakistani population."
https://openalex.org/W3213968965,"Machine-assisted treatment selection commonly follows one of two paradigms: a fully personalized paradigm which ignores any possible clustering of patients; or a sub-grouping paradigm which ignores personal differences within the identified groups. While both paradigms have shown promising results, each of them suffers from important limitations. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based treatment selection approach that is shown to strike a balance between the two paradigms using latent-space prototyping. Our approach is specifically tailored for domains in which effective prototypes and sub-groups of patients are assumed to exist, but groupings relevant to the training objective are not observable in the non-latent space. In an extensive evaluation, using both synthetic and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) real-world clinical data describing 4754 MDD patients from clinical trials for depression treatment, we show that our approach favorably compares with state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, the model produced an 8% absolute and 23% relative improvement over random treatment allocation. This is potentially clinically significant, given the large number of patients with MDD. Therefore, the model can bring about a much desired leap forward in the way depression is treated today."
https://openalex.org/W3132799640,"The present study aimed to examine effects of motivational and social cognition constructs on children’s leisure-time physical activity participation alongside constructs representing implicit processes using an extended trans-contextual model. The study adopted a correlational prospective design. Secondary-school students ( N = 502) completed self-report measures of perceived autonomy support from physical education (PE) teachers, autonomous motivation in PE and leisure-time contexts, and social cognition constructs (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control), intentions, trait self-control, habits, and past behavior in a leisure-time physical activity context. Five weeks later, students ( N = 298) self-reported their leisure-time physical activity participation. Bayesian path analyses supported two key premises of the model: perceived autonomy support was related to autonomous motivation in PE, and autonomous motivation in PE was related to autonomous motivation in leisure time. Indirect effects indicated that both forms of autonomous motivation were related to social cognition constructs and intentions. However, intention was not related to leisure-time physical activity participation, so model variables reflecting motivational processes did not account for substantive variance in physical activity participation. Self-control, attitudes, and past behavior were direct predictors of intentions and leisure-time physical activity participation. There were indirect effects of autonomous motivation in leisure time on intentions and physical activity participation mediated by self-control. Specifying informative priors for key model relations using Bayesian analysis yielded greater precision for some model effects. Findings raise some questions on the predictive validity of constructs from the original trans-contextual model in the current sample, but highlight the value of extending the model to incorporate additional constructs representing non-conscious processes."
https://openalex.org/W3212267997,"SRY-box 2 (Sox2) is a transcription factor with critical roles in maintaining embryonic stem (ES) cell and adult stem cell functions and in tumorigenesis. However, how Sox2 exerts its transcriptional function remains unclear. Here, we used an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay to discover transcriptional regulators for ES cell core transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) and identified members of the steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) as Sox2-specific interacting proteins. The SRC family coactivators have broad roles in transcriptional regulation, but it is unknown whether they also serve as Sox2 coactivators. We demonstrated that these proteins facilitate Sox2 transcriptional activity and act synergistically with p300. Furthermore, we uncovered an acetylation-enhanced interaction between Sox2 and SRC-2/3, but not SRC-1, demonstrating it is Sox2 acetylation that promotes the interaction. We identified putative Sox2 acetylation sites required for acetylation-enhanced interaction between Sox2 and SRC-3 and demonstrated that acetylation on these sites contributes to Sox2 transcriptional activity and recruitment of SRC-3. We showed that activation domains 1 and 2 of SRC-3 both display a preferential binding to acetylated Sox2. Finally, functional analyses in mouse ES cells demonstrated that knockdown of SRC-2/3 but not SRC-1 in mouse ES cells significantly downregulates the transcriptional activities of various Sox2 target genes and impairs ES cell stemness. Taken together, we identify specific SRC family proteins as novel Sox2 coactivators and uncover the role of Sox2 acetylation in promoting coactivator recruitment and Sox2 transcriptional function."

Serum samples and clinical data of 557 men who underwent RP for PCa with pathological stage (pT) <3 at Martini Clinic (Hamburg, Germany) were used for analysis. Clinical Grade Group and clinical stage was determined using biopsy samples while tumor marker concentrations were measured in serum using immunoassays. The prognostic utility of the proposed marker combination was assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis. The performance was compared to the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score in the overall cohort and in a low-risk patient subset. A multivariable model comprising fibronectin 1, galectin-3-binding protein, lumican, matrix metalloprotease 9, thrombospondin-1 and PSA together with clinical Grade Group (GG) and clinical stage (cT) was created. The proposed model was a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence (BCR) (HR 1.29 per 5 units score, 95%CI 1.20-1.38, p<0.001). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the proposed model had a better prediction for low-risk disease after RP compared to CAPRA (respectively 5.0% vs. 9.1% chance of BCR). In a pre-defined low risk population subset, the risk of BCR using the proposed model was below 5.2% and thus lower when compared to CAPRA = 0-2 (9%), GG<2 (7%) and NCCN = low-risk (6%) subsets. Additionally, the proposed model could significantly (p<0.001) discriminate patients with adverse pathology (AP) events at RP from those without. In conclusion, the proposed model is superior to CAPRA for the prediction of BCR after RP in the overall cohort as well as a in a pre-defined low risk patient population subset. It is also significantly associated with AP at RP."

In this study, we investigate the effect of SUR1-E1506K mutation on atherogenesis in hypercholesterolemic LDLR-/- mice.SUR1-E1506K mutated mice were cross-bred with LDLR-/- mice (SUR1Δ/LDLR-/-), 6 months old mice were fed a western-diet (WD) for 6 months to induce advanced atherosclerotic plaques. At the age of 12 months, atherosclerosis and plaque morphology were analyzed and mRNA gene expression were measured from aortic sections and macrophages. Glucose metabolism was characterized before and after WD. Results were compared to age-matched LDLR-/- mice.Advanced atherosclerotic plaques did not differ in size between the two strains. However, in SUR1Δ/LDLR-/- mice, plaque necrotic area was increased and smooth muscle cell number was reduced, resulting in higher plaque vulnerability index in SUR1Δ/LDLR-/- mice compared to LDLR-/- mice. SUR1Δ/LDLR-/- mice exhibited impaired glucose tolerance and elevated fasting glucose after WD. The positive staining area of IL-1β and NLRP3 inflammasome were increased in aortic sections in SUR1Δ/LDLR-/- mice compared to LDLR-/- mice, and IL-18 plasma level was elevated in SUR1Δ/LDLR-/- mice. Finally, the mRNA expression of IL-1β and IL-18 were increased in SUR1Δ/LDLR-/- bone marrow derived macrophages in comparison to LDLR-/- macrophages in response to LPS.SUR1-E1506K mutation impairs glucose tolerance and increases arterial inflammation, which promotes a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque phenotype in LDLR-/- mice."

This study objective was to evaluate long-term health and economic outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of apixaban over VKA, as a treatment option for patients with AF having ACS/PCI.A lifetime Markov cohort model was developed comparing apixaban versus VKA across multiple treatment strategies (triple [with P2Y12 + aspirin] or dual [with P2Y12] therapy followed by monotherapy [apixaban or VKA]; triple followed by dual and then monotherapy; dual followed by monotherapy). The model adopted the Spanish healthcare perspective, with a 3-month cycle length and costs and health outcomes discounted at 3%.Treatment with apixaban resulted in total cost savings of €883 and higher life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) per patient than VKA (net difference, LYs: 0.13; QALYs: 0.11). Bleeding and ischemic events (per 100 patients) were lower with apixaban than VKA (net difference, -13.9 and -1.8, respectively). Incremental net monetary benefit for apixaban was €3,041, using a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, apixaban was dominant in the majority of simulations (92.6%), providing additional QALYs at lower costs than VKA.Apixaban was a dominant treatment strategy than VKA from both the Spanish payer's and societal perspectives, regardless of treatment strategy considered."

https://openalex.org/W3213656626,"We used measurements of metabolic perturbation obtained after sparring to estimate energetics contribution during no-gi Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Ten advanced grapplers performed two six-minute sparring bouts separated by 24 hours. Kinetics of recovery rate of oxygen uptake was modelled and post-combat-sparring blood-lactate concentration measured to estimate oxygen equivalents for phospholytic and glycolytic components of anaerobic energetics, respectively. Linear regression was used to estimate end-combat-sparring rate of oxygen uptake. Regional and whole-body composition were assessed using dual X-ray absorptiometry with associations between these measurements and energy turnover explored using Pearson's correlation coefficient (significance, P < 0.05). Estimated oxygen equivalents for phospholytic and glycolytic contributions to anaerobic metabolism were 16.9 ± 8.4 (~28%) and 44.6 ± 13.5 (~72%) mL∙kg-1, respectively. Estimated end-exercise rate of oxygen uptake was 44.2 ± 7.0 mL∙kg-1∙min-1. Trunk lean mass was positively correlated with both total anaerobic and glycolytic-specific energetics (total, R = 0.645, p = 0.044; glycolytic, R = 0.692, p = 0.027) and negatively correlated with end-exercise rate of oxygen uptake (R = -0.650, p = 0.042). There were no correlations for any measurement of body composition and phospholytic-specific energetics. Six minutes of no-gi Brazilian jiu-jitsu sparring involves high relative contribution from the glycolytic component to total anaerobic energy provision and the link between this energetics profile and trunk lean mass is consistent with the predominance of ground-based combat that is unique for this combat sport. Training programs for Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners should be designed with consideration given to these specific energetics characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3213857717,"Many machine learning procedures, including clustering analysis are often affected by missing values. This work aims to propose and evaluate a Kernel Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm considering the kernelization of the metric with local adaptive distances (VKFCM-K-LP) under three types of strategies to deal with missing data. The first strategy, called Whole Data Strategy (WDS), performs clustering only on the complete part of the dataset, i.e. it discards all instances with missing data. The second approach uses the Partial Distance Strategy (PDS), in which partial distances are computed among all available resources and then re-scaled by the reciprocal of the proportion of observed values. The third technique, called Optimal Completion Strategy (OCS), computes missing values iteratively as auxiliary variables in the optimization of a suitable objective function. The clustering results were evaluated according to different metrics. The best performance of the clustering algorithm was achieved under the PDS and OCS strategies. Under the OCS approach, new datasets were derive and the missing values were estimated dynamically in the optimization process. The results of clustering under the OCS strategy also presented a superior performance when compared to the resulting clusters obtained by applying the VKFCM-K-LP algorithm on a version where missing values are previously imputed by the mean or the median of the observed values."

MBSR is a well-known psychological technique, which is believed to improve self-control and reduce stress. We conduct the experiment with 139 participants, half of whom receive the MBSR training, while the other half are asked to watch a documentary series, both over 4 consecutive weeks. Using a range of self-reported and physiological measures (such as cortisol measures), we find evidence that mindfulness training reduces perceived stress, but we only find weak evidence of effects on risk and inter-temporal attitudes."
https://openalex.org/W3212275136,"Gene expression data provide an opportunity for reverse-engineering gene-gene associations using network inference methods. However, it is difficult to assess the performance of these methods because the true underlying network is unknown in real data. Current benchmarks address this problem by subsampling a known regulatory network to conduct simulations. But the topology of regulatory networks can vary greatly across organisms or tissues, and reference-based generators-such as GeneNetWeaver-are not designed to capture this heterogeneity. This means, for example, benchmark results from the E. coli regulatory network will not carry over to other organisms or tissues. In contrast, probabilistic generators do not require a reference network, and they have the potential to capture a rich distribution of topologies. This makes probabilistic generators an ideal approach for obtaining a robust benchmarking of network inference methods.We propose a novel probabilistic network generator that (1) provides an alternative to address the inherent limitation of reference-based generators and (2) is able to create realistic gene association networks, and (3) captures the heterogeneity found across gold-standard networks better than existing generators used in practice. Eight organism-specific and 12 human tissue-specific gold-standard association networks are considered. Several measures of global topology are used to determine the similarity of generated networks to the gold-standards. Along with demonstrating the variability of network structure across organisms and tissues, we show that the commonly used ""scale-free"" model is insufficient for replicating these structures.This generator is implemented in the R package ""SeqNet"" and is available on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SeqNet/index.html)."

In this context, savoring refers to a cognitive form of emotion regulation used to maintain and extend positive emotional experiences and is considered to contribute to health and well-being. Chronic pain has been linked to reduced reward-seeking behavior. This is the first study to investigate the relationship between self-reported chronic pain and savoring.We conducted an anonymous cross-sectional survey in a large non-clinical sample (opera, theater, and cabaret visitors; n = 322). The variables were assessed with a two-item-questionnaire.Self-reported chronic pain was significantly negatively correlated with savoring (r = -.547).Altogether, this result helps to develop a better understanding of the effects of chronic pain in humans and to shed light on state-dependent differences in aesthetic experiences."

In this study, we aim to measure the magnitude of inequalities in the coverage of RMNCH services. We also made an attempt to divulge the relationship between the various themes of governance and RMNCH indices.We used National Family Health Survey dataset (2015-16) and Public Affairs Index (PAI), 2016 for the analysis. Two summative indices, namely Composite Coverage Index (CCI) and Co-Coverage (Co-Cov) indicator were constructed to measure the RMNCH coverage. Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Relative Index of Inequality (RII) were employed to measure inequality in the distribution of coverage of RMNCH. In addition, we have used Spearman's rank correlation matrix to glean the association between governance indicator and coverage indices.Our study indicates an erratic distribution in the coverage of CCI and Co-Cov across wealth quintiles and state groups. We found that the distribution of RII values for Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal hovered around 1. Whereas, RII values for Haryana was 2.01 indicating maximum inequality across wealth quintiles. Furthermore, the essential interventions like adequate antenatal care services (ANC4) and skilled birth attendants (SBA) were the most inequitable interventions, while tetanus toxoid and Bacilli Calmette- Guerin (BCG) were least inequitable. The Spearman's rank correlation matrix demonstrated a strong and positive correlation between governance indicators and coverage indices."
