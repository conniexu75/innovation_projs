https://openalex.org/W2054385769,"16S ribosomal RNA currently represents the most important target of study in bacterial ecology. Its use for the description of bacterial diversity is, however, limited by the presence of variable copy numbers in bacterial genomes and sequence variation within closely related taxa or within a genome. Here we use the information from sequenced bacterial genomes to explore the variability of 16S rRNA sequences and copy numbers at various taxonomic levels and apply it to estimate bacterial genome and DNA abundances. In total, 7,081 16S rRNA sequences were in silico extracted from 1,690 available bacterial genomes (1–15 per genome). While there are several phyla containing low 16S rRNA copy numbers, in certain taxa, e.g., the Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria, the variation is large. Genome sizes are more conserved at all tested taxonomic levels than 16S rRNA copy numbers. Only a minority of bacterial genomes harbors identical 16S rRNA gene copies, and sequence diversity increases with increasing copy numbers. While certain taxa harbor dissimilar 16S rRNA genes, others contain sequences common to multiple species. Sequence identity clusters (often termed operational taxonomic units) thus provide an imperfect representation of bacterial taxa of a certain phylogenetic rank. We have demonstrated that the information on 16S rRNA copy numbers and genome sizes of genome-sequenced bacteria may be used as an estimate for the closest related taxon in an environmental dataset to calculate alternative estimates of the relative abundance of individual bacterial taxa in environmental samples. Using an example from forest soil, this procedure would increase the abundance estimates of Acidobacteria and decrease these of Firmicutes. Using the currently available information, alternative estimates of bacterial community composition may be obtained in this way if the variation of 16S rRNA copy numbers among bacteria is considered."

Tetraspanin molecules are commonly used as protein markers of extracellular vesicles, although their role in the unexplored mechanisms of cargo selection into exosomes has not been addressed. For that purpose, we have characterized the intracellular tetraspanin-enriched microdomain (TEM) interactome by high throughput mass spectrometry, in both human lymphoblasts and their derived exosomes, revealing a clear pattern of interaction networks. Proteins interacting with TEM receptors cytoplasmic regions presented a considerable degree of overlap, although some highly specific CD81 tetraspanin ligands, such as Rac GTPase, were detected. Quantitative proteomics showed that TEM ligands account for a great proportion of the exosome proteome and that a selective repertoire of CD81-associated molecules, including Rac, is not correctly routed to exosomes in cells from CD81-deficient animals. Our data provide evidence that insertion into TEM may be necessary for protein inclusion into the exosome structure.

https://openalex.org/W2014750665,"While experimental and observational studies suggest that sugar intake is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes, independent of its role in obesity, it is unclear whether alterations in sugar intake can account for differences in diabetes prevalence among overall populations. Using econometric models of repeated cross-sectional data on diabetes and nutritional components of food from 175 countries, we found that every 150 kcal/person/day increase in sugar availability (about one can of soda/day) was associated with increased diabetes prevalence by 1.1% (p <0.001) after testing for potential selection biases and controlling for other food types (including fibers, meats, fruits, oils, cereals), total calories, overweight and obesity, period-effects, and several socioeconomic variables such as aging, urbanization and income. No other food types yielded significant individual associations with diabetes prevalence after controlling for obesity and other confounders. The impact of sugar on diabetes was independent of sedentary behavior and alcohol use, and the effect was modified but not confounded by obesity or overweight. Duration and degree of sugar exposure correlated significantly with diabetes prevalence in a dose-dependent manner, while declines in sugar exposure correlated with significant subsequent declines in diabetes rates independently of other socioeconomic, dietary and obesity prevalence changes. Differences in sugar availability statistically explain variations in diabetes prevalence rates at a population level that are not explained by physical activity, overweight or obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2123580386,"The rapid worldwide emergence of the amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is having a profound negative impact on biodiversity. However, global research efforts are fragmented and an overarching synthesis of global infection data is lacking. Here, we provide results from a community tool for the compilation of worldwide Bd presence and report on the analyses of data collated over a four-year period. Using this online database, we analysed: 1) spatial and taxonomic patterns of infection, including amphibian families that appear over- and under-infected; 2) relationships between Bd occurrence and declining amphibian species, including associations among Bd occurrence, species richness, and enigmatic population declines; and 3) patterns of environmental correlates with Bd, including climate metrics for all species combined and three families (Hylidae, Bufonidae, Ranidae) separately, at both a global scale and regional (U.S.A.) scale. These associations provide new insights for downscaled hypothesis testing. The pathogen has been detected in 52 of 82 countries in which sampling was reported, and it has been detected in 516 of 1240 (42%) amphibian species. We show that detected Bd infections are related to amphibian biodiversity and locations experiencing rapid enigmatic declines, supporting the hypothesis that greater complexity of amphibian communities increases the likelihood of emergence of infection and transmission of Bd. Using a global model including all sampled species, the odds of Bd detection decreased with increasing temperature range at a site. Further consideration of temperature range, rather than maximum or minimum temperatures, may provide new insights into Bd-host ecology. Whereas caution is necessary when interpreting such a broad global dataset, the use of our pathogen database is helping to inform studies of the epidemiology of Bd, as well as enabling regional, national, and international prioritization of conservation efforts. We provide recommendations for adaptive management to enhance the database utility and relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2063439487,"Although there is increasing interest in the effects of habitat disturbance on community attributes and the potential consequences for ecosystem functioning, objective approaches linking biodiversity loss to functional loss are uncommon. The objectives of this study were to implement simultaneous assessment of community attributes (richness, abundance and biomass, each calculated for total-beetle assemblages as well as small- and large-beetle assemblages) and three ecological functions of dung beetles (dung removal, soil perturbation and secondary seed dispersal), to compare the effects of habitat disturbance on both sets of response variables, and their relations. We studied dung beetle community attributes and functions in five land-use systems representing a disturbance gradient in the Brazilian Amazon: primary forest, secondary forest, agroforestry, agriculture and pasture. All response variables were affected negatively by the intensification of habitat disturbance regimes, but community attributes and ecological functions did not follow the same pattern of decline. A hierarchical partitioning analysis showed that, although all community attributes had a significant effect on the three ecological functions (except the abundance of small beetles on all three ecological functions and the biomass of small beetles on secondary dispersal of large seed mimics), species richness and abundance of large beetles were the community attributes with the highest explanatory value. Our results show the importance of measuring ecological function empirically instead of deducing it from community metrics."
https://openalex.org/W2071959081,"Aim Recent evidence suggests that several dietary polyphenols may exert their chemopreventive effect through epigenetic modifications. Curcumin is one of the most widely studied dietary chemopreventive agents for colon cancer prevention, however, its effects on epigenetic alterations, particularly DNA methylation, remain unclear. Using systematic genome-wide approaches, we aimed to elucidate the effect of curcumin on DNA methylation alterations in colorectal cancer cells. Materials and Methods To evaluate the effect of curcumin on DNA methylation, three CRC cell lines, HCT116, HT29 and RKO, were treated with curcumin. 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) and trichostatin A treated cells were used as positive and negative controls for DNA methylation changes, respectively. Methylation status of LINE-1 repeat elements, DNA promoter methylation microarrays and gene expression arrays were used to assess global methylation and gene expression changes. Validation was performed using independent microarrays, quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing, and qPCR. Results As expected, genome-wide methylation microarrays revealed significant DNA hypomethylation in 5-aza-CdR-treated cells (mean β-values of 0.12), however, non-significant changes in mean β-values were observed in curcumin-treated cells. In comparison to mock-treated cells, curcumin-induced DNA methylation alterations occurred in a time-dependent manner. In contrast to the generalized, non-specific global hypomethylation observed with 5-aza-CdR, curcumin treatment resulted in methylation changes at selected, partially-methylated loci, instead of fully-methylated CpG sites. DNA methylation alterations were supported by corresponding changes in gene expression at both up- and down-regulated genes in various CRC cell lines. Conclusions Our data provide previously unrecognized evidence for curcumin-mediated DNA methylation alterations as a potential mechanism of colon cancer chemoprevention. In contrast to non-specific global hypomethylation induced by 5-aza-CdR, curcumin-induced methylation changes occurred only in a subset of partially-methylated genes, which provides additional mechanistic insights into the potent chemopreventive effect of this dietary nutraceutical."
https://openalex.org/W1969401867,"Recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors are potentially powerful tools for gene therapy of CNS diseases, but their penetration into brain parenchyma is severely limited by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and current delivery relies on invasive stereotactic injection. Here we evaluate the local, targeted delivery of rAAV vectors into the brains of mice by noninvasive, reversible, microbubble-facilitated focused ultrasound (FUS), resulting in BBB opening that can be monitored and controlled by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using this method, we found that IV-administered AAV2-GFP (green fluorescence protein) with a low viral vector titer (1×109 vg/g) can successfully penetrate the BBB-opened brain regions to express GFP. We show that MRI monitoring of BBB-opening could serve as an indicator of the scale and distribution of AAV transduction. Transduction peaked at 3 weeks and neurons and astrocytes were affected. This novel, noninvasive delivery approach could significantly broaden the application of AAV-viral-vector-based genes for treatment of CNS diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2024693928,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs of ∼22 nucleotides in length, and constitute a novel class of gene regulators by imperfect base-pairing to the 3′UTR of protein encoding messenger RNAs. Growing evidence indicates that miRNAs are implicated in several pathological processes in myocardial disease. The past years, we have witnessed several profiling attempts using high-density oligonucleotide array-based approaches to identify the complete miRNA content (miRNOME) in the healthy and diseased mammalian heart. These efforts have demonstrated that the failing heart displays differential expression of several dozens of miRNAs. While the total number of experimentally validated human miRNAs is roughly two thousand, the number of expressed miRNAs in the human myocardium remains elusive. Our objective was to perform an unbiased assay to identify the miRNOME of the human heart, both under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. We used deep sequencing and bioinformatics to annotate and quantify microRNA expression in healthy and diseased human heart (heart failure secondary to hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy). Our results indicate that the human heart expresses >800 miRNAs, the majority of which not being annotated nor described so far and some of which being unique to primate species. Furthermore, >250 miRNAs show differential and etiology-dependent expression in human dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The human cardiac miRNOME still possesses a large number of miRNAs that remain virtually unexplored. The current study provides a starting point for a more comprehensive understanding of the role of miRNAs in regulating human heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W2103041883,"Food security and water scarcity have become two major concerns for future human's sustainable development, particularly in the context of climate change. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of climate change impacts on the production and water use of major cereal crops on a global scale with a spatial resolution of 30 arc-minutes for the 2030s (short term) and the 2090s (long term), respectively. Our findings show that impact uncertainties are higher on larger spatial scales (e.g., global and continental) but lower on smaller spatial scales (e.g., national and grid cell). Such patterns allow decision makers and investors to take adaptive measures without being puzzled by a highly uncertain future at the global level. Short-term gains in crop production from climate change are projected for many regions, particularly in African countries, but the gains will mostly vanish and turn to losses in the long run. Irrigation dependence in crop production is projected to increase in general. However, several water poor regions will rely less heavily on irrigation, conducive to alleviating regional water scarcity. The heterogeneity of spatial patterns and the non-linearity of temporal changes of the impacts call for site-specific adaptive measures with perspectives of reducing short- and long-term risks of future food and water security."
https://openalex.org/W2011628826,"In a mouse model of skin repair we found that the class I-IIa histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A accelerated tissue regeneration. Unexpectedly, this effect was suppressed by Sirtinol, a class III histone deacetylase (HDAC) (sirtuin)-selective inhibitor. The role of sirtuins (SIRTs) was then investigated by using resveratrol and a novel SIRT1-2-3 activator, the MC2562 compound we synthesized recently. Both resveratrol and MC2562 were effective in accelerating wound repair. The local administration of natural or synthetic SIRT activators, in fact, significantly accelerated skin regeneration by increasing keratinocyte proliferation. In vitro experiments revealed that the activation of SIRTs stimulated keratinocyte proliferation via endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation and NO production. In this condition, the class I member HDAC2 was found S-nitrosylated on cysteine, a post-transduction modification associated with loss of activity and DNA binding capacity. After deacetylase inhibitor or SIRT activator treatment, ChIP showed, in fact, a significant HDAC2 detachment from the promoter region of insulin growth factor I (IGF-I), fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF-10), and Epithelial Growth Factor (EGF), which may be the final recipients and effectors of the SIRT-NO-HDAC signaling cascade. Consistently, the effect of SIRT activators was reduced in the presence of NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), a general inhibitor of NO synthesis. In conclusion, the NO-dependent cross-talk among class III and I histone deacetylases suggests an unprecedented signaling pathway important for skin repair.

https://openalex.org/W2002389623,"Ranging from dwarfs to giants, the species of honeybees show remarkable differences in body size that have placed evolutionary constrains on the size of sensory organs and the brain. Colonies comprise three adult phenotypes, drones and two female castes, the reproductive queen and sterile workers. The phenotypes differ with respect to tasks and thus selection pressures which additionally constrain the shape of sensory systems. In a first step to explore the variability and interaction between species size-limitations and sex and caste-specific selection pressures in sensory and neural structures in honeybees, we compared eye size, ommatidia number and distribution of facet lens diameters in drones, queens and workers of five species (Apis andreniformis, A. florea, A. dorsata, A. mellifera, A. cerana). In these species, male and female eyes show a consistent sex-specific organization with respect to eye size and regional specialization of facet diameters. Drones possess distinctly enlarged eyes with large dorsal facets. Aside from these general patterns, we found signs of unique adaptations in eyes of A. florea and A. dorsata drones. In both species, drone eyes are disproportionately enlarged. In A. dorsata the increased eye size results from enlarged facets, a likely adaptation to crepuscular mating flights. In contrast, the relative enlargement of A. florea drone eyes results from an increase in ommatidia number, suggesting strong selection for high spatial resolution. Comparison of eye morphology and published mating flight times indicates a correlation between overall light sensitivity and species-specific mating flight times. The correlation suggests an important role of ambient light intensities in the regulation of species-specific mating flight times and the evolution of the visual system. Our study further deepens insights into visual adaptations within the genus Apis and opens up future perspectives for research to better understand the timing mechanisms and sensory physiology of mating related signals."
https://openalex.org/W2036361103,"DNA barcoding as a tool for species identification has been successful in animals and other organisms, including certain groups of plants. The exploration of this new tool for species identification, particularly in tree species, is very scanty from biodiversity-rich countries like India. rbcL and matK are standard barcode loci while ITS, and trnH-psbA are considered as supplementary loci for plants.Plant barcode loci, namely, rbcL, matK, ITS, trnH-psbA, and the recently proposed ITS2, were tested for their efficacy as barcode loci using 300 accessions of tropical tree species. We tested these loci for PCR, sequencing success, and species discrimination ability using three methods. rbcL was the best locus as far as PCR and sequencing success rate were concerned, but not for the species discrimination ability of tropical tree species. ITS and trnH-psbA were the second best loci in PCR and sequencing success, respectively. The species discrimination ability of ITS ranged from 24.4 percent to 74.3 percent and that of trnH-psbA was 25.6 percent to 67.7 percent, depending upon the data set and the method used. matK provided the least PCR success, followed by ITS2 (59. 0%). Species resolution by ITS2 and rbcL ranged from 9.0 percent to 48.7 percent and 13.2 percent to 43.6 percent, respectively. Further, we observed that the NCBI nucleotide database is poorly represented by the sequences of barcode loci studied here for tree species.Although a conservative approach of a success rate of 60-70 percent by both ITS and trnH-psbA may not be considered as highly successful but would certainly help in large-scale biodiversity inventorization, particularly for tropical tree species, considering the standard success rate of plant DNA barcode program reported so far. The recommended matK and rbcL primers combination may not work in tropical tree species as barcode markers."
https://openalex.org/W2009965647,"Relative age effects (RAEs) occur when those who are relatively older for their age group are more likely to succeed. RAEs occur reliably in some educational and athletic contexts, yet the causal mechanisms remain unclear. Here we provide the first direct test of one mechanism, selection bias, which can be defined as evaluators granting fewer opportunities to relatively younger individuals than is warranted by their latent ability. Because RAEs are well-established in hockey, we analyzed National Hockey League (NHL) drafts from 1980 to 2006. Compared to those born in the first quarter (i.e., January–March), those born in the third and fourth quarters were drafted more than 40 slots later than their productivity warranted, and they were roughly twice as likely to reach career benchmarks, such as 400 games played or 200 points scored. This selection bias in drafting did not decrease over time, apparently continues to occur, and reduces the playing opportunities of relatively younger players. This bias is remarkable because it is exhibited by professional decision makers evaluating adults in a context where RAEs have been widely publicized. Thus, selection bias based on relative age may be pervasive."

Plant MAPK cascades have been implicated in development and stress responses. Although MAPKKKs have been investigated in several plant species including Arabidopsis and rice, no systematic analysis has been conducted in maize. In this study, we performed a bioinformatics analysis of the entire maize genome and identified 74 MAPKKK genes. Phylogenetic analyses of MAPKKKs from maize, rice and Arabidopsis have classified them into three subgroups, which included Raf, ZIK and MEKK. Evolutionary relationships within subfamilies were also supported by exon-intron organizations and the conserved protein motifs. Further expression analysis of the MAPKKKs in microarray databases revealed that MAPKKKs were involved in important signaling pathways in maize different organs and developmental stages. Our genomics analysis of maize MAPKKK genes provides important information for evolutionary and functional characterization of this family in maize."
https://openalex.org/W1971865963,"Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk in observational studies. Whether these associations are causal is not clear. Loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin gene result in up to 10% higher serum vitamin D concentrations, supposedly due to a decreased UV-protection of the keratinocytes. We used a Mendelian randomization approach to estimate the causal effect of vitamin D status on serum lipids, blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, and the metabolic syndrome.Three population based studies were included, Monica10 (2,656 individuals aged 40-71 years), Inter99 (6,784 individuals aged 30-60 years), and Health2006 (3,471 individuals aged 18-69 years) conducted in 1993-94, 1999-2001, and 2006-2008, respectively. Participants were genotyped for the two most common filaggrin gene mutations in European descendants R501X and 2282del4, in all three studies and further for the R2447X mutation in the Inter99 and Health2006 studies. Filaggrin genotype was used as instrumental variable for vitamin D status. Baseline measurements of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were performed in all three studies.Instrumental variable analyses showed a 23.8% (95% confidence interval, CI 3.0, 48.6) higher HDL cholesterol level and a 30.5% (95% CI: 0.8, 51.3) lower serum level of triglycerides per doubling of vitamin D. These associations were, however, not statistically significant when applying the Bonferroni adjusted significance level. The remaining lipids showed non-significant changes in a favorable direction. Doubling of vitamin D gave a non-significantly lower odds ratio = 0.26 (95% CI: 0.06, 1.17) of the metabolic syndrome. There were no statistically significant causal effects of vitamin D status on blood pressure, body mass index, or waist circumference.Our results support a causal effect of higher vitamin D status on a more favorable lipid profile, although more studies in other populations are needed to confirm our results."
https://openalex.org/W1989700192,"Chemerin is a specific chemoattractant for macrophages and dendritic cells (DC). In addition, it can rapidly stimulate macrophage adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and adhesion molecules and is able to activate fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Chemerin is also an adipocytokine that has been related to the inflammatory state of endothelial cells and as such could be involved in the changes in endothelial cells in RA and perhaps increased cardiovascular morbidity. We investigated whether anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) treatment affects chemerin levels.49 patients with active RA (disease activity score evaluated in 28 joints (DAS28) ≥3.2) were started on adalimumab therapy. Blood was drawn from patients while fasting at baseline and 16 weeks after initiation of treatment. Chemerin serum levels were measured by ELISA and related to disease activity, mediators of inflammation and known risk factors for cardiovascular disease.Adalimumab therapy reduced chemerin serum levels, which was correlated with the reduction in DAS28 (r = 0.37, p = 0.009). In addition, the decrease in chemerin serum levels after anti-TNF treatment was associated with the decrease in serum levels of IL-6 (r = 0.39, p = 0.033) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) (r = 0.31, p = 0.049). Baseline chemerin serum levels were not related to traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis, except perhaps for smoking (p = 0.07).This exploratory study shows that adalimumab therapy lowers chemerin levels, which is associated with the reduction in disease activity parameters, and inflammatory mediators IL-6 and MIF. This suggests a possible involvement of chemerin in the migration/retention of macrophages in the synovium. TRIAL REGISTRATION NEDERLANDS TRIAL REGISTER: NTR 857."

https://openalex.org/W2010895728,"The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a pigmented monolayer of cells lying between the photoreceptors and a layer of fenestrated capillaries, the choriocapillaris. Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked progressive degeneration of these three layers caused by the loss of function of Rab Escort protein-1 (REP1). REP1 is involved in the prenylation of Rab proteins, key regulators of membrane trafficking. To study the pathological consequences of chronic disruption of membrane traffic in the RPE we used a cell type-specific knock-out mouse model of the disease, where the Chm/Rep1 gene is deleted only in pigmented cells (ChmFlox, Tyr-Cre+). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to quantitate the melanosome distribution in the RPE and immunofluorescent staining of rhodopsin was used to quantitate phagocytosed rod outer segments in retinal sections. The ultrastructure of the RPE and Bruch’s membrane at different ages was characterised by TEM to analyse age-related changes occurring as a result of defects in membrane traffic pathways. Chm/Rep1 gene knockout in RPE cells resulted in reduced numbers of melanosomes in the apical processes and delayed phagosome degradation. In addition, the RPE accumulated pathological changes at 5–6 months of age similar to those observed in 2-year old controls. These included the intracellular accumulation of lipofuscin-containing deposits, disorganised basal infoldings and the extracellular accumulation of basal laminar and basal linear deposits. The phenotype of the ChmFlox, Tyr-Cre+ mice suggests that loss of the Chm/Rep1 gene causes premature accumulation of features of aging in the RPE. Furthermore, the striking similarities between the present observations and some of the phenotypes reported in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) suggest that membrane traffic defects may contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD."

Before germ cell specification, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), BMP8b, and BMP2 secreted from the extraembryonic ectoderm and visceral endoderm induce the formation of PGC precursor cells in the proximal epiblast. These PGC precursor cells express transcriptional regulators B lymphocyte maturation-induced protein 1 (Blimp1) and PR domain containing 14 (Prdm14). The former suppresses gene expression required for somatic cell differentiation, such as Snail and Hox genes, and the latter controls genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming in PGCs (2Saitou M.

Nanos3 is an RNA-binding protein expressed in PGCs after E7.5 and prevents apoptosis of PGCs during migration (8Tsuda M. Sasaoka Y. Kiso M. Abe K. Haraguchi S. Kobayashi S. Saga Y. Conserved role of nanos proteins in germ cell development.Science. 2003; 301: 1239-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). c-Kit is a receptor tyrosine kinase, and the signal from the c-Kit ligand is required for proliferation and directed migration of PGCs (9Runyan C. Schaible K. Molyneaux K. Wang Z. Levin L. Wylie C. Steel factor controls midline cell death of primordial germ cells and is essential for their normal proliferation and migration.Development. 2006; 133: 4861-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition, some knock-out mouse studies have revealed essential factors for PGC survival between E8.5 and E13.5, including RNA-binding protein dead end 1 (Dnd1), T cell-restricted intracellular antigen 1-related protein (TIAR), a homeodomain transcription factor of the POU family, Oct4, and a unique homeoprotein transcription factor, Nanog (10Beck A.R.

Epigenetic modification also occurs during PGC migration. Reduction of H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and up-regulation of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) are principal epigenetic modifications after E8.5, which control the chromatin state of the PGC genome (14Seki Y.

PGCs proliferate for another 1 or 2 days after they colonize the genital ridges and then differentiate into spermatozoa or oocytes (16Schmahl J. Eicher E.M. Washburn L.L. Capel B.

REV7 (also named MAD2L2 and MAD2B) is a protein involved in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, gene expression, and carcinogenesis. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rev7 and Rev3 bind to each other to form DNA polymerase ζ (Pol ζ), in which Rev3 is a catalytic subunit possessing a polymerase activity and Rev7 is an accessory subunit (17Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Thymine-thymine dimer bypass by yeast DNA polymerase ζ.Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Pol ζ is a member of the specialized low fidelity DNA polymerases, including Y-family polymerases, Pol η, Pol ι, Pol κ, and Rev1, which are capable of synthesizing DNA at DNA lesions via a mechanism called translesion DNA synthesis (18Guo C. Kosarek-Stancel J.N. Tang T.S. Friedberg E.C. Y-family DNA polymerases in mammalian cells.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 2363-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Rev7 enhances the polymerase activity of Rev3, indicating the involvement of Rev7 in the DNA damage response (17Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Thymine-thymine dimer bypass by yeast DNA polymerase ζ.Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). A human homolog of yeast Rev7 has been identified as an interacting partner of human REV3 (19Murakumo Y. Roth T. Ishii H. Rasio D. Numata S. Croce C.M. Fishel R.

Human fibroblasts with siRNA-mediated depletion of REV7 expression show high sensitivity to UV-induced cytotoxicity and reduced sensitivity to UV-induced mutagenesis compared with those in control lines, indicating that REV7 is required for tolerance to UV-induced DNA damage (23McNally K. Neal J.A. McManus T.P. McCormick J.J.

Recently, it has been reported that Pol ζ and REV1 are involved in homologous recombination repair of DNA double strand breaks, although its mechanism is not fully understood (24Okada T. Sonoda E. Yoshimura M. Kawano Y. Saya H. Kohzaki M. Takeda S. Multiple roles of vertebrate REV genes in DNA repair and recombination.Mol. Cell.

REV1 and polymerase ζ facilitate homologous recombination repair.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 682-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). On the other hand, REV7 has been identified as the second human homolog of S. cerevisiae Mad2 (26Cahill D.P. da Costa L.T. Carson-Walter E.B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Lengauer C. Characterization of MAD2B and other mitotic spindle checkpoint genes.Genomics. 1999; 58: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). REV7 binds to CDH1 and CDC20, which are cell cycle regulating proteins, and inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex that degrades cyclin B1 (27Chen J. Fang G. MAD2B is an inhibitor of the anaphase-promoting complex.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1765-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Pfleger C.M. Salic A. Lee E. Kirschner M.W. Inhibition of Cdh1-APC by the MAD2-related protein MAD2L2. A novel mechanism for regulating Cdh1.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When recombinant human REV7 protein was injected into Xenopus embryos, gastrulation was dramatically arrested (28Pfleger C.M. Salic A. Lee E. Kirschner M.W. Inhibition of Cdh1-APC by the MAD2-related protein MAD2L2. A novel mechanism for regulating Cdh1.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). REV7 also interacts with the Shigella effector IpaB, and mediates cell cycle arrest of Shigella-infected epithelial cells (29Iwai H. Kim M. Yoshikawa Y. Ashida H. Ogawa M. Fujita Y. Muller D. Kirikae T. Jackson P.K. Kotani S. Sasakawa C. A bacterial effector targets Mad2L2, an APC inhibitor, to modulate host cell cycling.Cell. 2007; 130: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). IpaB-bound REV7 is sequestered away from CDH1, causing unscheduled activation of the anaphase-promoting complex, which disrupts cell cycle-dependent regulation of cyclin B1 expression, resulting in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in Shigella-infected epithelial cells. These findings indicate that REV7 is involved in cell cycle regulation. In addition, it has been reported that REV7 interacts with the transcription factor ELK-1 and regulates expression of its target genes, egr-1 and c-fos, after treatment with DNA-damaging agents (30Zhang L. Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Rev7/MAD2B links c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase pathway signaling to activation of the transcription factor Elk-1.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2861-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). REV7 also interacts with TCF-4, a component of the WNT signaling pathway, and modulates TCF-4-mediated E-cadherin expression (31Hong C.F. Chou Y.T. Lin Y.S. Wu C.W. MAD2B, a novel TCF4-binding protein, modulates TCF4-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation.J. Biol.

Moreover, it has been reported that several proteins involved in carcinogenesis, such as PRCC (papillary renal cell carcinoma) and HCCA2 (hepatocellular carcinoma-associated gene 2), interact with REV7. Increased levels of REV7 mRNA in colon cancer are significantly correlated with reduced patient survival, suggesting that REV7 is associated with human cancer biology (32Weterman M.A. van Groningen J.J. Tertoolen L. van Kessel A.G. Impairment of MAD2B-PRCC interaction in mitotic checkpoint defective t(X;1)-positive renal cell carcinomas.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the significance of REV7 in mammalian development has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we generated REV7-deficient (Rev7−/−) mice and analyzed their phenotypes to understand the biological significance of REV7 in mouse development. We show that REV7 is involved in the prevention of apoptotic cell death of PGCs and is essential for PGC maintenance in the embryo. Our findings indicate the importance of REV7 expression in mouse development. The targeting vector was constructed using pBlueScript II KS (Agilent Technologies) possessing a neomycin (neo) selection marker with a phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter. A 1330-bp genomic fragment upstream of the start codon of the mouse Rev7 locus was synthesized by PCR and inserted before the PGK-neo cassette. A 5110-bp genomic sequence (containing Rev7 exon 3–8) was synthesized by PCR and inserted after the PGK-neo cassette (Fig. 1A). PCR products were generated using PfuUltraTM High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies), and genomic DNA from the 129SvJ strain was used as a template. The targeting vector was verified by DNA sequencing and restriction mapping. The targeting vector was linearized and introduced by electroporation into ES cells derived from 129SvJ mice. After G418/diphtheria toxin A positive-negative selection, two ES cell clones with successful homologous recombination were identified by Southern blot screening of NheI-digested genomic DNA with a 5′ probe (Fig. 1A). The two clones were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts and chimeric mice were generated by PhoenixBio. The genetic background of the mice used in this study was C57BL6J/129SvJ. All mice were housed in polycarbonate cages containing hardwood chip bedding at 25 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle. All animal protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine. Genomic DNAs extracted from mouse tail biopsies were used for PCR genotyping. Sequences of the primer sets used for genotyping are listed in Table 1. PCR products of WT and targeted alleles were 230 and 750 bp, respectively.

The 5′ probe indicated in Fig. 1A was radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a High Prime kit (Roche). Southern hybridization was performed using a conventional protocol. A 4.66-kb fragment and a 3.96-kb fragment were detected for the WT and targeted alleles, respectively. A Mouse Multiple Tissue Northern blot Membrane was purchased from Clontech. Total RNAs from mouse tissues were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten micrograms of total RNAs were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto nylon membranes (GE Healthcare). Northern hybridization was performed with radiolabeled mouse Rev7 or β-actin cDNA probes using standard methodologies. Small pieces of mouse tissue were homogenized by sonication in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, and 20 μg/ml of bromophenol blue). After measuring the protein concentration using a DC protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad), lysates were boiled at 100 °C for 2 min in the presence of 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. Lysates containing 50 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore Corporation). The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature (RT) in Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque) with gentle agitation and then incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at RT. After washing with TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (Dako) for 1 h at RT. After washing the membranes, the reaction was detected using an ECL Detection Kit (GE Healthcare) and visualized by an ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini (GE Healthcare). A rabbit polyclonal anti-REV7 antibody was produced by immunization with full-length human REV7 protein fused to GST. The antibody was affinity purified using full-length recombinant mouse REV7 protein. Anti-promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF), -GATA-4, -Oct4, -proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and -GAPDH antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. An anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Japan. Anti-phospho-histone H2A.X (Ser-139), -dimethyl-histone H3 (Lys-9), and -trimethyl-histone H3 (Lys-27) antibodies were purchased from Millipore Corporation. Mouse tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Four-μm thick sections were prepared for H&E staining and immunohistochemistry. H&E staining was performed by a conventional method. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol. For antigen retrieval, sections were immersed in Target Retrieval Solution, pH 9.0 (Dako), and heated for 30 min at 98 °C in a water bath. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 10 min at RT. Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at RT. Endogenous peroxidase was inhibited by incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 15 min. Then, sections were incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated to HRP-labeled polymer (EnVision+ anti-rabbit; Dako) for 15 min at RT. The reaction products were visualized with diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Dako), and nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. Whole mount immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (35Matsunami H. Takeichi M.

Mouse embryos were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin overnight, washed three times with PBST (10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4) for 10 min, washed three times with distilled water for 10 min, and then heated in Target Retrieval Solution for 30 min at 98 °C. Embryos were then washed three times with PBST for 10 min and then immersed in 10% normal rabbit serum for 90 min at RT for blocking. Samples were incubated with an anti-Oct4 antibody (1:100 dilution) overnight at 4 °C and then washed three times with PBST for 30 min. Endogenous peroxidase was inhibited by incubation with 2% hydrogen peroxide in TBST for 4 h at 4 °C. Then, samples were incubated with an anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to HRP-labeled polymer (1:200 dilution) (Dako) overnight at 4 °C, followed by washing 12 times with PBST for 30 min. The immunoreaction was visualized using DAB. To obtain embryos, pregnant mice were anesthetized with sevoflurane prior to being sacrificed. Dissected organs (E17.5, ∼30 mg), whole bodies (E8.5), or trunks (E13.5) were homogenized in RLT buffer of the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) using BioMasher (Nippi). Total RNA was isolated from the homogenate using the RNeasy Mini Kit, followed by treatment with DNase (Qiagen) to minimize genomic DNA contamination according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified RNA samples were reverse-transcribed using ReverTra Ace (Toyobo). Twelve ng of RNA equivalent-cDNA was mixed with Thunderbird SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo) and amplified on a Mx3005P thermal cycler (Agilent Technologies) using gene-specific primer sets as described in Table 1 (36Chen T.

Mice were perfused intravascularly with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution. The testes were dissected, embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek), and then frozen on dry ice. Ten-micrometer thick sections were prepared using a cryostat (Leica Microsystems). A mouse Rev7-specific riboprobe was designed to target the 207-bp region that was deleted in the Rev7−/− mouse. A PCR product containing the riboprobe target region and RNA polymerase binding sites (SP6 for the sense probe, and T7 for the antisense probe) were generated using primers 5′-CCAAGCTATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAACACCCTCCACGCCCTCCC-3′ and 5′-TGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATCCGGGTGACAGGACACTGAA-3′. Radiolabeled riboprobes were synthesized with SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases (Roche) and [33P]dUTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sections were hybridized overnight at 60 °C using 200 μl of hybridization solution per section, consisting of 1 × 106 cpm of radiolabeled probe and hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.5 m NaCl, 1× Denhardt's solution, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 500 μg/ml of yeast tRNA, and 10 mm DTT). Following hybridization, sections were immersed in 2× standard saline citrate for 15 min at RT and then in RNase buffer (20 μg/ml of RNase A, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) for 30 min at 37 °C. After extensive washing and dehydration, sections were dipped in twice-diluted Kodak Autoradiography Emulsion, Type NTB (Eastman Kodak), and then dried at RT for 30 min in a darkroom. Sections were stored at 4 °C for ∼2 weeks while protected from light and developed using Kodak D19 Developer and Fixer (Eastman Kodak). Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed with digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probes as described previously (38Wilkinson D.G. Nieto M.A. Detection of messenger RNA by in situ hybridization to tissue sections and whole mounts.Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Probes were synthesized using the same PCR product used for in situ hybridization on frozen sections and DIG RNA labeling mix (Roche Applied Science). Mouse embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with 10 μg/ml of proteinase K in PBST at 37 °C for 15 min, and then treated with 2 mg/ml of glycine at RT for 5 min. After re-fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde + 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBST for 20 min at RT, embryos were immersed in pre-hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 50 μg/ml of heparin, 5 mg/ml of trout RNA, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science), and 0.1% Tween 20) for 90 min at 70 °C, and then incubated with hybridization solution (0.2 μg of DIG-labeled RNA probes in pre-hybridization buffer) at 70 °C overnight.

HJC-D1 culture broth on the cell integrity and physiological characteristics of M. aeruginosa FACHB-905 was investigated using the ﬂow cytometry (FCM), enzyme activity and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods. Results showed that the growth of M. aeruginosa FACHB-905 was significantly inhibited, and the percentage of live cells depended on the culture broth concentration and exposure time. The activities of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) increased with exposure concentration and exposure time, and the significant increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) led to the disruption of the subcellular structure of M. aeruginosa FACHB-905, and caused the increase of malondialdehyde (MDA). Furthermore, TEM observation suggested the presence of three stages (cell breakage, organelle release and cell death) for the cyanobactericidal process of Streptomyces sp. HJC-D1. Therefore, Streptomyces sp.

https://openalex.org/W1976660823,"Sudden elevations in external sodium chloride (NaCl) accelerate potassium (K+) efflux across the plasma membrane of plant root cells. It has been proposed that the extent of this acceleration can predict salt tolerance among contrasting cultivars. However, this proposal has not been considered in the context of plant nutritional history, nor has it been explored in rice (Oryza sativa L.), which stands among the world’s most important and salt-sensitive crop species. Using efflux analysis with 42K, coupled with growth and tissue K+ analyses, we examined the short- and long-term effects of NaCl exposure to plant performance within a nutritional matrix that significantly altered tissue-K+ set points in three rice cultivars that differ in salt tolerance: IR29 (sensitive), IR72 (moderate), and Pokkali (tolerant). We show that total short-term K+ release from roots in response to NaCl stress is small (no more than 26% over 45 min) in rice. Despite strong varietal differences, the extent of efflux is shown to be a poor predictor of plant performance on long-term NaCl stress. In fact, no measure of K+ status was found to correlate with plant performance among cultivars either in the presence or absence of NaCl stress. By contrast, shoot Na+ accumulation showed the strongest correlation (a negative one) with biomass, under long-term salinity. Pharmacological evidence suggests that NaCl-induced K+ efflux is a result of membrane disintegrity, possibly as result of osmotic shock, and not due to ion-channel mediation. Taken together, we conclude that, in rice, K+ status (including efflux) is a poor predictor of salt tolerance and overall plant performance and, instead, shoot Na+ accumulation is the key factor in performance decline on NaCl stress."
https://openalex.org/W2006020905,"Understanding the evolution of parasites is important to both basic and applied evolutionary biology. Knowledge of the genetic structure of parasite populations is critical for our ability to predict how an infection can spread through a host population and for the design of effective control methods. However, very little is known about the genetic structure of most human parasites, including the human louse (Pediculus humanus). This species is composed of two ecotypes: the head louse (Pediculus humanus capitis De Geer), and the clothing (body) louse (Pediculus humanus humanus Linnaeus). Hundreds of millions of head louse infestations affect children every year, and this number is on the rise, in part because of increased resistance to insecticides. Clothing lice affect mostly homeless and refugee-camp populations and although they are less prevalent than head lice, the medical consequences are more severe because they vector deadly bacterial pathogens. In this study we present the first assessment of the genetic structure of human louse populations by analyzing the nuclear genetic variation at 15 newly developed microsatellite loci in 93 human lice from 11 sites in four world regions. Both ecotypes showed heterozygote deficits relative to Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and high inbreeding values, an expected pattern given their parasitic life history. Bayesian clustering analyses assigned lice to four distinct genetic clusters that were geographically structured. The low levels of gene flow among louse populations suggested that the evolution of insecticide resistance in lice would most likely be affected by local selection pressures, underscoring the importance of tailoring control strategies to population-specific genetic makeup and evolutionary history. Our panel of microsatellite markers provides powerful data to investigate not only ecological and evolutionary processes in lice, but also those in their human hosts because of the long-term coevolutionary association between lice and humans."
https://openalex.org/W1975150200,"EpCAM is expressed at low levels in a variety of normal human epithelial tissues, but is overexpressed in 70–90% of carcinomas. From a clinico-pathological point of view, this has both prognostic and therapeutic significance. EpCAM was first suggested as a therapeutic target for the treatment of epithelial cancers in the 1990s. However, following several immunotherapy trials, the results have been mixed. It has been suggested that this is due, at least in part, to an unknown level of EpCAM expression in the tumors being targeted. Thus, selection of patients who would benefit from EpCAM immunotherapy by determining EpCAM status in the tumor biopsies is currently undergoing vigorous evaluation. However, current EpCAM antibodies are not robust enough to be able to detect EpCAM expression in all pathological tissues. Here we report a newly developed EpCAM RNA aptamer, also known as a chemical antibody, which is not only specific but also more sensitive than current antibodies for the detection of EpCAM in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary breast cancers. This new aptamer, together with our previously described aptamer, showed no non-specific staining or cross-reactivity with tissues that do not express EpCAM. They were able to reliably detect target proteins in breast cancer xenograft where an anti-EpCAM antibody (323/A3) showed limited or no reactivity. Our results demonstrated a more robust detection of EpCAM using RNA aptamers over antibodies in clinical samples with chromogenic staining. This shows the potential of aptamers in the future of histopathological diagnosis and as a tool to guide targeted immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2150262988,"Although the activity of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is exquisitely sensitive to its membrane environment, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. The homologous prokaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channel, Gloebacter ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), represents an excellent model for probing the molecular basis of nAChR sensitivity because of its high structural homology, relative ease of expression, and amenability to crystallographic analysis. We show here that membrane-reconstituted GLIC exhibits structural and biophysical properties similar to those of the membrane-reconstituted nAChR, although GLIC is substantially more thermally stable. GLIC, however, does not possess the same exquisite lipid sensitivity. In particular, GLIC does not exhibit the same propensity to adopt an uncoupled conformation where agonist binding is uncoupled from channel gating. Structural comparisons provide insight into the chemical features that may predispose the nAChR to the formation of an uncoupled state."
https://openalex.org/W2056881097,"Aerobactin genes are known to be present in virulent strains and absent from avirulent strains, but contributions of iucC and iucA, which are involved in aerobactin synthesis, to the pathogenicity of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) have not been clarified. In this study, effects of double mutants (iucA/iutA or iucC/iutA) compared to those of single mutants (iucA, iucC or iutA) of aerobactin genes on the virulence of APEC strain E058 were examined both in vitro (aerobactin production, ingestion into HD-11 cells, survival in chicken serum) and in vivo (competitive growth against parental strain, colonization and persistence). In competitive co-infection assays, compared to the E058 parental strain, the E058ΔiucA mutant was significantly reduced in the liver, kidney, spleen (all P<0.01), heart and lung (both P<0.001). The E058ΔiutA mutant also was significantly reduced in the liver, lung, kidney (all P<0.01), heart and spleen (both P<0.001). The E058ΔiucC mutant was significantly attenuated in the heart and kidney (both P<0.05) and showed a remarkable reduction in the liver, spleen and lung (P<0.01); meanwhile, both E058ΔiucAΔiutA and E058ΔiucCΔiutA double mutants were sharply reduced as well (P<0.001). In colonization and persistence assays, compared with E058, recovered colonies of E058ΔiucA were significantly reduced from the lung, liver, spleen and kidney (P<0.01) and significantly reduced in the heart (P<0.001). E058ΔiutA was significantly reduced from the heart, lung, liver, spleen and kidney (P<0.01). E058ΔiucC, E058ΔiucAΔiutA and E058ΔiucCΔiutA were significantly decreased in all organs tested (P<0.001). These results suggest that iutA, iucA and iucC play important roles in the pathogenicity of APEC E058."
https://openalex.org/W2007980919,"The activation of CD40 on B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells by its ligand CD154 (CD40L) is essential for the development of humoral and cellular immune responses. CD40L and other TNF superfamily ligands are noncovalent homotrimers, but the form under which CD40 exists in the absence of ligand remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that both cell surface-expressed and soluble CD40 self-assemble, most probably as noncovalent dimers. The cysteine-rich domain 1 (CRD1) of CD40 participated to dimerization and was also required for efficient receptor expression. Modelization of a CD40 dimer allowed the identification of lysine 29 in CRD1, whose mutation decreased CD40 self-interaction without affecting expression or response to ligand. When expressed alone, recombinant CD40-CRD1 bound CD40 with a KD of 0.6 μm. This molecule triggered expression of maturation markers on human dendritic cells and potentiated CD40L activity. These results suggest that CD40 self-assembly modulates signaling, possibly by maintaining the receptor in a quiescent state.

Ligand-induced oligomerization is an important process for activating cell surface receptors like cytokine receptors, G protein-coupled receptors, protein-tyrosine kinase receptors, Toll-like receptors, and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily members (TNFRSF) 6The abbreviations used are: TNFRSFTNF receptor superfamilyBS3(bis)sulfosuccinimidyl suberateCRDcysteine-rich domainEDACN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimideTRAILTNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. in a number of biological events (1Tetsch L.

Although this ligand-receptor complex is generally accepted to be the minimal requirement for signaling, some members of the family are only efficiently triggered by at least two adjacent trimeric ligands (4Holler N.

The form under which ligand-free TNFRSF members exist is still not fully understood. Indeed, unliganded TNFR1 crystallized as a parallel dimer (6Naismith J.H. Devine T.Q. Brandhuber B.J. Sprang S.R.

Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. A domain in TNF receptors that mediates ligand-independent receptor assembly and signaling.Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DcR3 (TNFRSF6B) assembled as parallel dimers when crystallized alone, but as trimers when co-crystallized with its ligand TL1A, each receptor in this trimeric form contacting a different ligand (9Zhan C.

Thus, receptors may exist both as dimers or trimers depending on the context. Gathering more structural information on unliganded TNF receptors will help to better understand the mechanism of ligand-induced receptor signaling. TNF receptor superfamily (bis)sulfosuccinimidyl suberate cysteine-rich domain N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. The extracellular region of TNFRSF members is characterized by the presence of cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) which typically contain six cysteine residues engaged in the formation of three disulfide bonds. The number of CRDs in a given receptor usually varies from one to four (3Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. The molecular architecture of the TNF superfamily.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). TNFR1 and CD40 possess four CRDs, of which only CRD2 and 3 are directly involved in ligand binding. Crystallography of unliganded TNFR1 (TNFRSF1A) (6Naismith J.H. Devine T.Q. Brandhuber B.J. Sprang S.R. Crystallographic evidence for dimerization of unliganded tumor necrosis factor receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13303-13307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) showed homodimerization in either parallel or anti-parallel manners (7Naismith J.H. Devine T.Q. Kohno T. Sprang S.R. Structures of the extracellular domain of the type I tumor necrosis factor receptor.Structure. 1996; 4: 1251-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Anti-parallel dimers associate through an interface that overlaps with CRD1 and 2, whereas parallel dimers associate mainly via CRD1 and leave ligand binding sites accessible. Cell-based studies identified a preligand-binding assembly domain at the N terminus of TNFR1 and 2 that is required for preassembly of TNFR complexes in a fully ligand-responsive conformation (8Chan F.K. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. A domain in TNF receptors that mediates ligand-independent receptor assembly and signaling.Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). In any case, TNF receptors appear to exist as preformed complexes and not as monomeric receptors that would only oligomerize upon ligand binding. In line with these results, the CRD1 of Fas (TNFRSF6) was shown to be essential for the formation of homotypic, ligand-independent receptor complexes (10Siegel R.M. Frederiksen J.K. Zacharias D.A. Chan F.K. Johnson M. Lynch D. Tsien R.Y. Lenardo M.J. Fas preassociation required for apoptosis signaling and dominant inhibition by pathogenic mutations.Science. 2000; 288: 2354-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The situation is more complex for the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), another TNF family member that binds five different receptors: two fully functional death receptors, TRAIL-R1 (TNFRSF10A) and TRAIL-R2 (TNFRSF10B), two membrane bound “decoy” receptors, TRAIL-R3 (TNFRSF10C) and TRAIL-R4 (TNFRSF10D), and a soluble decoy receptor, OPG (TNFRSF11B). Decoy receptors inhibit cell death by competing for TRAIL binding. However, inhibition of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by TRAIL-R4 critically depends on its association with TRAIL-R2 via the N-terminal domain containing the first partial CRD of both receptors. Thus, in contrast to homotypic TNFR1 or Fas complexes, TRAIL-R2 and TRAIL-R4 form mixed complexes as a means to regulate TRAIL-induced apoptosis (11Clancy L. Mruk K. Archer K. Woelfel M. Mongkolsapaya J. Screaton G. Lenardo M.J. Chan F.K. Preligand assembly domain-mediated ligand-independent association between TRAIL receptor 4 (TR4) and TR2 regulates TRAIL-induced apoptosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18099-18104Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The present study focuses on CD40 (TNFRSF5). Engagement of CD40 by CD40L leads to CD40 clustering, recruitment of TNFR-associated factors, and activation, among others, of the transcription factor NF-κB (12Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S.

CD40 is expressed mainly on professional antigen-presenting cells, i.e. dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells (14van Kooten C. Banchereau J. CD40-CD40 ligand.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), and its activation is essential for the development of humoral and cellular immune responses. Thus, selective blockade or activation of CD40 is of pharmacological interest. The crystal structure of CD40-CD40L was recently solved showing that CRD2 and CRD3 are both involved in CD40L binding (15An H.J. Kim Y.J. Song D.H. Park B.S. Kim H.M. Lee J.D. Paik S.G. Lee J.O.

Chem. 2011; 286: 11226-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); however, little is known about the function of CRD1 and CRD4. Here, we show that CD40 exists as preformed, noncovalent dimers on the cell surface and that dimerization is dependent on the extracellular region. Mutation of K29 in CRD1 impaired CD40 self-assembly. Recombinant CD40-CRD1 bound the extracellular domain of CD40 with a KD of approximately 0.6 μm and displayed an agonist-like activity on CD40-expressing cells such as human dendritic cells. Co-incubation of CD40-CRD1 with CD40L potentiated the NF-κB response induced by CD40L alone, suggesting that CRD1 interactions participate in CD40 signaling. These observations provide a novel means to manipulate CD40 signaling. Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza, Basel) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 5 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Anti-CD40 (clone C20) monoclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-myc antibody from Life Technologies were used for Western blot analysis. Two different CD40L (CD154) were used as indicated: muCD8-CD40L (Ancell) and Mega-CD40L (Adipogen). Antibodies for flow cytometry analysis were purchased from BD Biosciences: Pacific blue CD14 and PerCp5.5 HLA-DR were used for monocyte purification control; PE-Cy7 CD86, PerCp5.5 HLA-DR, and APC CD83 were used to follow monocyte-derived dendritic cell maturation. Approximately 2 × 107 HEK293 cells stably expressing CD40 or BJAB cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS (pH 8) within the culture flask (HEK cells) or in 15-ml tubes (BJAB cells). BS3 cross-linker (Thermo Scientific) was added at a final concentration of 3 mm for 1 h at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of Tris at a final concentration of 20 mm for 15 min. Cells were then harvested and analyzed by Western blotting. myc-H-tagged CD40 was produced in HEK293 cells using the mammalian expression vector pSectag2-Hy (Life Technologies) and purified from cell culture supernatant by nickel affinity chromatography. The encoded mature protein sequence was DAAQPAMNS, followed by amino acids 20–193 of human CD40 and the sequence QAAARGGPEQKLISEEDLNSAVDHHHHHH. The CRD1 of CD40 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Rosseta-gami 2 using the expression vector pET22b+ (Merck). The encoded protein sequence was MDIGINSDPNS, followed by amino acids 20–62 of human CD40 and the sequence AAALEHHHHHH. Mutations K29A, K29E, C26Q, or the triple mutation C37G/C38G/C41G was introduced by conventional molecular biology techniques. Bacteria were induced for production of the proteins at an A600 nm of 0.6 with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 16 h at 20 °C. Soluble periplasmic proteins were extracted and purified by nickel affinity chromatography as described in Ref. 16Smulski C. Labovsky V. Levy G. Hontebeyrie M. Hoebeke J. Levin M.J.

Prior to mass analysis, protein samples were dialyzed against 200 mm ammonium acetate on Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter unit-10000NMWL (Millipore). Mass spectrometry was performed on an ESI-TOF mass spectrometer Q-TOF micro. Purity and homogeneity were verified by mass analysis in denaturing conditions: the protein was diluted to a concentration of 0.3 μm in water-acetonitrile (1:10, v/v) acidified with 1% formic acid. In nondenaturing conditions, the mass measurement of the protein was performed in 50 mm ammonium acetate with 10% isopropyl alcohol, to preserve the native conformation. The protein was injected at 2.0 μm. Clusters of Cs(n+1)In were used for the calibration of the extended masse range in the high m/z region. Mass data were acquired in the positive ion mode on the mass range 1000–10,000 m/z. CD40 deglycosylation was performed using the deglycosylation mix from New England Biolabs following the manufacturer's instructions. All procedures were performed with Discovery Studio 2.5 software from Accelrys (San Diego, CA). The crystal structure of the ligand-free TNFR1 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 1NCF) was used as template to build a model of dimeric CD40. The receptor monomer corresponds to the crystal structure of the complex CD40-CD40L (PDB ID code 3QD6). A fixed atom constraint was applied to both C-terminal residues, and the dimeric CD40 model was subjected to an initial minimization step (maximum 500), root-mean-square (RMS) gradient 0.1 kcal/mol by conjugated gradient; followed by a second minimization step (maximum 500), RMS gradient 0.0001 kcal/mol by conjugated gradient. The structure was then submitted to a dynamic simulation including heating (2000 steps), equilibration (1000 steps), and production (1000 steps) at 300 K with a time step of 0.001 ps under a distance-dependent, dielectric constant, implicit solvent model. A negative intermolecular energy of −361.5 kcal/mol was obtained for the complex under these conditions. In silico mutation K29A produced an increase on the interaction energy to −218.0 kcal/mol, indicating a less stable complex. All images were generated using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, version 1.0 (Schrödinger, LLC). CD40-ECFP, CD40-EYFP, and the negative control ERBB2-EYFP C-terminal fusion proteins all contained the full-length receptor sequences. Mutations K29A and K29E were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Experiments were performed using a LSRII (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer instrument. EYFP signal was recorded using the 488-nm laser with a 530/30 filter; the ECFP signal was recorded using the 405-nm laser with a 450/50 filter, and FRET signal was recorded using the 405-nm laser with a 585/42 filter. For each condition we evaluated a minimum of 10,000 ECFP-EYFP double-positive cells. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with ECFP and EYFP fusion receptors and analyzed at 16 h after transfection. Positive FRET cells were gated using an ECFP-EYFP fusion protein as positive control and a co-transfection of EFCP and EYFP as negative control according to Ref. 17Banning C. Votteler J. Hoffmann D.

The Biacore 3000 system, sensor chip CM5, surfactant P20, amine coupling kit containing N-hydroxysuccinimide and EDAC and ethanolamine were from Biacore (Uppsala, Sweden). Biosensor assays were performed with HBS-EP buffer as running buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm sodium chloride, 3 mm EDTA 0.005% surfactant P20 (pH 7.4)). The low carboxylated dextran matrix (B1) was activated with 35 μl of a mixture 0.2 m EDAC and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide at 5 μl/min. The anti-myc antibody (Life Technologies) was immobilized with the standard Biacore protocol at ∼2000 resonance units (RU) per channel. Soluble CD40-myc tag fusion protein was injected for 30 s, then increasing concentrations of recombinant CRD1 were injected for 2 min, followed by a dissociation phase of 3 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. All dilutions were performed in running buffer. The sensor chip surface was regenerated after each experiment by injecting 20 μl of 3 m MgCl2. The kinetic parameters were calculated using BIAeval 4.1 software. Analysis was performed using the simple Langmuir binding model. The specific binding profiles were obtained after subtracting the response signal from the control anti-myc antibody alone channel and from blank-buffer injection. The fitting to each model was judged by the chi square (χ2) value and randomness of residue distribution compared with the theoretical model. Active concentration was determined under mass transfer condition where the slope of the curves is directly correlated with the active concentration of the protein (18Richalet-Sécordel P.M.

After 24 h cells were transfected with control luciferase vectors or promoter specific luciferase reporter vectors (Panomics, Fremont, CA), using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Reporter luciferase assays were performed for STAT3, AP1, CRE, NF-κB, and SRE that all are CD40L-activated transcription factors. After 24h, cells were treated with CD40L or a recombinant CD40-CRD1 protein at the indicated concentrations in the presence of 20 μg/ml polymyxin B (Fluka, St. Louis, MO). After 16 h cells were lysed and luciferase activity was determined using a Wallac Victor2 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to instructions of the Promega luciferase assay system. Dual luciferase assay was performed using NF-κB reporter plasmid together with Renilla luciferase plasmid for normalization. Detection of firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase expression was done using the dual luciferase assay detection kit (Promega). Elutriated monocytes were obtained from the Etablissement Français du Sang (EFS; Strasbourg, France). Monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with Ultraglutamine (Lonza) supplemented with 10 μg/ml gentamycin, 2 mm HEPES, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. At day 0, cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 106 cells/well in a 6-wells plate, and differentiation into CD209-positive dendritic cells was induced by addition of 5 ng/ml GM-CSFHuXp and 5 ng/ml IL-4HuXp (Humanzyme, Chicago, IL). At day 5, when >80% of the cells expressed CD209 (data not shown), cells were incubated with the indicated stimuli in the presence or absence of 100 μg/ml polymyxin B (Fluka). After 24 h of culture, cells were harvested and washed with 2 ml of cold PBS, and maturation maker expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were stained in PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum at 4 °C for 20 min with the various antibodies used at concentration recommended by the manufacturer. After two washes in PBS, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry with a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). At least 10,000 events were acquired for each experiment, and the data were processed with the Kaluza® Flow Analysis Software (Beckman Coulter). FRET experiments were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey post test, and luciferase NF-κB and monocyte-derived dendritic cell maturation assays were analyzed using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post test, using GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software). To define the oligomerization state of CD40 in the absence of ligand, HEK cells stably transfected with full-length WT CD40 were chemically cross-linked with the nonpermeable reagent BS3. Western blot analysis revealed that a portion of CD40, migrating at ∼45 kDa, shifted to a dimer of ∼90 kDa in cross-linked cell lysates (Fig. 1A). Some CD40 dimer was also observed in the B cell lymphoma BJAB cell line that expresses endogenous CD40 (Fig. 1A). To define the contribution of the extracellular region to dimerization, soluble CD40 fused to the nonoligomerizing myc and H tags was produced in mammalian cells. This soluble CD40 bound CD154 in a surface plasmon resonance assay (data not shown). Under denaturing SDS-PAGE, soluble CD40 migrated as a band of ∼36 kDa under both reducing and nonreducing conditions, but the same protein eluted with an apparent molecular mass of ∼72 kDa from a size exclusion chromatography column, suggesting that it may form roughly globular dimers (Fig. 1B). Although glycosylation interfered with ionization of soluble CD40 in native mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. 1), the deglycosylated protein behaved well in this assay which allowed detection of two peaks at masses of 23.94 and 47.86 kDa, corresponding relatively closely to expected theoretical values for the nonglycosylated monomeric (23.4 kDa) and dimeric (46.7 kDa) CD40 (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results indicate that at least a fraction of CD40 can self-assemble in the absence of ligand, most probably as a noncovalent homodimer. To define the site required for CD40 self-assembly, we first constructed a model of a CD40 dimer based on the structures of the parallel TNFR1 dimer (PDB ID code1NCF) and ligand-bound CD40 (PDB ID code 3QD6). The rational was that (i) the structure of monomeric (liganded) and dimeric (unliganded) TNFR1 differ strongly in CRD1, suggesting that this domain is important for self-assembly (supplemental Fig. 2A); (ii) lymphotoxin α-TNFR1 is the closest available crystal structure to CD40-CD40L (15An H.J. Kim Y.J. Song D.H. Park B.S. Kim H.M. Lee J.D. Paik S.G. Lee J.O. Lee H. Crystallographic and mutational analysis of the CD40-CD154 complex and its implications for receptor activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 11226-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); and given that (iii) CRD1 and 2 of TNFR1 and CD40 superimpose with a Cα root mean square deviation of 1.05 Å, chances of getting a relevant model were good (supplemental Fig. 2B). The model suggested the involvement of the CRD1 domain in CD40 self-assembly, with an important contribution of K29 (Fig. 2A). We therefore generated full-length CD40 constructs with mutation K29A, K29E, or with mutations predicted to disrupt folding of the first A1 sub-domain (C26Q) or of the entire CRD1 (triple cysteine mutant C37G/C38G/C41G: mutC), or lacking CRD1 but retaining the signal peptide (CD40ΔCRD1) (Fig. 2B). With the exception of the K29A and K29E mutants, all other untagged or EYFP-tagged CD40 CRD1 mutants were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, failed to reach the cell surface efficiently, and did not respond to exogenously added CD40L (Fig. 2C and supplemental Figs. 3, 4, and 5A), indicating that CD40 is sensitive to mutations affecting normal folding of its CRD1. In line with these results, steered molecular dynamic simulation showed strong local perturbations in CD40-CRD1 in the case of C26Q and mutC mutations and strong local perturbations in CD40-CRD2 in the case of the ΔCRD1 construct (supplemental Fig. 5B). As mentioned above, the CD40 dimer model suggested a contribution of K29 in receptor dimerization, and it is noteworthy that this residue is conserved in human and mouse CD40. In silico mutation of this residue to an alanine increased the interaction energies from −361 kcal/mol to −219 kcal/mol, highlighting its importance in receptor dimerization. We also introduced the mutation K29E to obtain a stronger effect by charge repulsion. Neither the K29A nor K29E mutation altered the surface expression of CD40 (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, CD40L-induced NF-κB activity was similar in the WT CD40 cell line compared with the mutant cell lines K29A and K29E (Fig. 2E). Under the same conditions, no activity was observed in the CD40 cell line lacking the intracellular domain (CD40-ΔICD). However, the ability of the CD40 K29A or K29E mutant to produce FRET signals with either themselves or with WT CD40 was reduced by approximately 50%, supporting the notion that K29 is involved in CRD1-mediated dimerization of CD40 (Fig. 3A). Finally, chemical cross-linking of untagged mutant or WT CD40 showed a marked reduction of dimeric species at the cell surface when using both mutant receptors compared with WT CD40 (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Mutations of lysine 29 disrupt CD40 self-assembly. A, cytometric FRET analysis was performed of CD40 interaction with WT CD40, CD40-K29A, or CD40-K29E, using both ECFP and EYFP fusion combinations. Mean values with S.E. (error bars) of three independent experiments are shown (**, p < 0.01). B, CD40 stable cell lines (WT, K29A, and K29E) were treated or not with the nonpermeable chemical cross-linker BS3. CD40 was then detected by Western blotting with an anti-CD40 antibody. Densitometry analysis is shown on the right as a ratio between monomeric and dimeric receptors. NS, nonspecific signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the isolated CD40-CRD1 was poorly secreted in HEK cells, it was successfully produced in a prokaryotic expression system with human-compatible tRNAs and enhanced ability to form disulfide bridges. CD40-CRD1 was also expressed with the K29A, K29E, and CRD1-disrupting mutations C26Q or mutC (Fig. 4A). All CRD1 molecules migrated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of ∼16 kDa despite their theoretical molecular mass of ∼8 kDa. Wild-type CD40-CRD1 bound to the extracellular domain of CD40 with a KD of 5.7 × 10−7 m (kon 2.04 × 103 m−1 s−1 and koff 1.16 × 10−3 s−1), as determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis, whereas no binding was detected for both cysteine mutants (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. 6). These data show the importance of an adequate CRD1 folding for binding to CD40. Of note, using surface plasmon resonance, the active concentration of CD40-CRD1 was estimated to be 4.7% of the total protein. In all experiments, the mentioned concentration of CD40-CRD1 is that of the active protein. The concentration of CRD1 mutants was estimated also as 4.7% of the total protein although it was not possible to estimate its active fraction because there is no detectable binding to CD40. As expected, an overnight stimulation of CD40-expressing cells with CD40L activated the NF-κB transcription factor and induced expression of a NF-κB luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 4C). Surprisingly, soluble CD40-CRD1 showed a weak agonistic activity on WT CD40-expressing HEK cells, but not on cells expressing CD40-K29A, CD40-K29E, or CD40 lacking the intracellular domain (CD40-ΔICD) (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, WT CRD1, but not the mutants, potentiated CD40L-induced NF-κB activation by up to 2-fold, with an IC50 of approximately 1.5 ± 0.5 μg/ml (Fig. 4D). In line with the observation that WT CD40-CRD1 could induce NF-κB activity in cells expressing WT CD40, but not in cells expressing mutant CD40, recombinant mutant CD40-CRD1 proteins were unable to increase CD40L activity in WT CD40 HEK cells. Because the CRD1 of CD40 does not interact with CD40L in the crystallographic structure of the CD40-CD40L complex (15An H.J. Kim Y.J. Song D.H. Park B.S. Kim H.M. Lee J.D. Paik S.G. Lee J.O. Lee H.

Data were reconstructed using filtered back projection (FBP) and IR (Philips Healthcare, iDose(4)-levels 2, 4 and 6) at similar radiation dose. Volumetric nodule measurements were performed with semi-automatic software on thin slice reconstructions. Only solid pulmonary nodules were measured, no additional selection criteria were used for the nature of nodules. For intra-observer and inter-observer variability, measurements were performed once by one observer and twice by another observer. Algorithms were compared using the concordance correlation-coefficient (pc) and Friedman-test, and post-hoc analysis with the Wilcoxon-signed ranks-test with Bonferroni-correction (significance-level p<0.017).Seventy-eight nodules were present including 56 small nodules (volume<200 mm(3), diameter<8 mm) and 22 large nodules (volume≥200 mm(3), diameter≥8 mm). No significant differences in measured pulmonary nodule volumes between FBP, iDose(4)-levels 2, 4 and 6 were found in both small nodules and large nodules. FBP and iDose(4)-levels 2, 4 and 6 were correlated with pc-values of 0.98 or higher for both small and large nodules. Pc-values of intra-observer and inter-observer variability were 0.98 or higher.Measurements of solid pulmonary nodule volume measured with standard-FBP were comparable with IR, regardless of the IR-level and no significant differences between measured volumes of both small and large solid nodules were found."
https://openalex.org/W1965765787,"Sirtuins, NAD-dependent protein deacetylases, play important roles in cellular functions such as metabolism and differentiation. Whether sirtuins function in tumorigenesis is still controversial, but sirtuins are aberrantly expressed in tumors, which may keep cancerous cells undifferentiated. Therefore, we investigated whether the inhibition of sirtuin family proteins induces cellular differentiation in leukemic cells. The sirtuin inhibitors tenovin-6 and BML-266 induce granulocytic differentiation in the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line NB4. This differentiation is likely caused by an inhibition of SIRT2 deacetylase activity, judging from the accumulation of acetylated α-tubulin, a major SIRT2 substrate. Unlike the clinically used differentiation inducer all-trans retinoic acid, tenovin-6 shows limited effects on promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor α (PML-RAR-α) stability and promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body formation in NB4 cells, suggesting that tenovin-6 does not directly target PML-RAR-α activity. In agreement with this, tenovin-6 induces cellular differentiation in the non-APL cell line HL-60, where PML-RAR-α does not exist. Knocking down SIRT2 by shRNA induces granulocytic differentiation in NB4 cells, which demonstrates that the inhibition of SIRT2 activity is sufficient to induce cell differentiation in NB4 cells. The overexpression of SIRT2 in NB4 cells decreases the level of granulocytic differentiation induced by tenovin-6, which indicates that tenovin-6 induces granulocytic differentiation by inhibiting SIRT2 activity. Taken together, our data suggest that targeting SIRT2 is a viable strategy to induce leukemic cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2092632970,"Approximately one third of the world population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. A better understanding of the pathogen biology is crucial to develop new tools/strategies to tackle its spread and treatment. In the host macrophages, the pathogen is exposed to reactive oxygen species, known to damage dGTP and GTP to 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, respectively. Incorporation of the damaged nucleotides in nucleic acids is detrimental to organisms. MutT proteins, belonging to a class of Nudix hydrolases, hydrolyze 8-oxo-G nucleoside triphosphates/diphosphates to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates and sanitize the nucleotide pool. Mycobacteria possess several MutT proteins. However, a functional homolog of Escherichia coli MutT has not been identified. Here, we characterized MtuMutT1 and Rv1700 proteins of M. tuberculosis. Unlike other MutT proteins, MtuMutT1 converts 8-oxo-dGTP to 8-oxo-dGDP, and 8-oxo-GTP to 8-oxo-GDP. Rv1700 then converts them to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates. This observation suggests the presence of a two-stage mechanism of 8-oxo-dGTP/8-oxo-GTP detoxification in mycobacteria. MtuMutT1 converts 8-oxo-dGTP to 8-oxo-dGDP with a Km of ∼50 μM and Vmax of ∼0.9 pmol/min per ng of protein, and Rv1700 converts 8-oxo-dGDP to 8-oxo-dGMP with a Km of ∼9.5 μM and Vmax of ∼0.04 pmol/min per ng of protein. Together, MtuMutT1 and Rv1700 offer maximal rescue to E. coli for its MutT deficiency by decreasing A to C mutations (a hallmark of MutT deficiency). We suggest that the concerted action of MtuMutT1 and Rv1700 plays a crucial role in survival of bacteria against oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W1984544247,"Human disease incidence attributed to arbovirus infection is increasing throughout the world, with effective control interventions limited by issues of sustainability, insecticide resistance and the lack of effective vaccines. Several promising control strategies are currently under development, such as the release of mosquitoes trans-infected with virus-blocking Wolbachia bacteria. Implementation of any control program is dependent on effective virus surveillance and a thorough understanding of virus-vector interactions. Massively parallel sequencing has enormous potential for providing comprehensive genomic information that can be used to assess many aspects of arbovirus ecology, as well as to evaluate novel control strategies. To demonstrate proof-of-principle, we analyzed Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus experimentally infected with dengue, yellow fever or chikungunya viruses. Random amplification was used to prepare sufficient template for sequencing on the Personal Genome Machine. Viral sequences were present in all infected mosquitoes. In addition, in most cases, we were also able to identify the mosquito species and mosquito micro-organisms, including the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia. Importantly, naturally occurring Wolbachia strains could be differentiated from strains that had been trans-infected into the mosquito. The method allowed us to assemble near full-length viral genomes and detect other micro-organisms without prior sequence knowledge, in a single reaction. This is a step toward the application of massively parallel sequencing as an arbovirus surveillance tool. It has the potential to provide insight into virus transmission dynamics, and has applicability to the post-release monitoring of Wolbachia in mosquito populations."
https://openalex.org/W1992353868,"Gastric cancer is the second common cause of cancer related death worldwide and lacks highly effective treatment for advanced disease. Nab-paclitaxel is a novel microtubule-inhibitory cytotoxic agent that has not been tested in gastric cancer as of yet. In this study, human gastric cancer cell lines AGS, NCI-N87 and SNU16 were studied. Nab-paclitaxel inhibited cell proliferation with an IC50 of 5 nM in SNU16, 23 nM in AGS and 49 nM in NCI-N87 cells after 72-hour treatment, which was lower than that of oxaliplatin (1.05 μM to 1.51 μM) and epirubicin (0.12 μM to 0.25 μM). Nab-paclitaxel treatment increased expression of the mitotic-spindle associated phospho-stathmin irrespective of the baseline total or phosphorylated stathmin level, and induced mitotic cell death as confirmed through increased expression of cleaved-PARP and caspase-3. After a two-week nab-paclitaxel, oxaliplatin or epirubicin treatment, the average in vivo local tumor growth inhibition rate was 77, 17.2 and 21.4 percent, respectively (p = 0.002). Effects of therapy on tumoral proliferative and apoptotic indices corresponded with tumor growth inhibition data, while expression of phospho-stathmin also increased in tissues. There was an increase in median animal survival after nab-paclitaxel treatment (93 days) compared to controls (31 days, p = 0.0007), oxaliplatin (40 days, p = 0.0007) or to docetaxel therapy (81 days, p = 0.0416). The strong antitumor activity of nab-paclitaxel in experimental gastric cancer supports such microtubule-inhibitory strategy for clinical application. Nab-paclitaxel benefits were observed independent from phosphorylated stathmin expression at baseline, putting into question the consideration of nab-paclitaxel use in gastric cancer based on this putative biomarker."
https://openalex.org/W2007139976,"Eucalyptus tetrodonta, a co-dominant tree species of tropical, northern Australian savannas, does not invade adjacent monsoon rain forest unless the forest is burnt intensely. Such facilitation by fire of seedling establishment is known as the ""ashbed effect."" Because the ashbed effect might involve disruption of common mycorrhizal networks, we hypothesized that in the absence of fire, intact rain forest arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) networks inhibit E. tetrodonta seedlings. Although arbuscular mycorrhizas predominate in the rain forest, common tree species of the northern Australian savannas (including adult E. tetrodonta) host ectomycorrhizas. To test our hypothesis, we grew E. tetrodonta and Ceiba pentandra (an AM-responsive species used to confirm treatments) separately in microcosms of ambient or methyl-bromide fumigated rain forest soil with or without severing potential mycorrhizal fungus connections to an AM nurse plant, Litsea glutinosa. As expected, C. pentandra formed mycorrhizas in all treatments but had the most root colonization and grew fastest in ambient soil. E. tetrodonta seedlings also formed AM in all treatments, but severing hyphae in fumigated soil produced the least colonization and the best growth. Three of ten E. tetrodonta seedlings in ambient soil with intact network hyphae died. Because foliar chlorosis was symptomatic of iron deficiency, after 130 days we began to fertilize half the E. tetrodonta seedlings in ambient soil with an iron solution. Iron fertilization completely remedied chlorosis and stimulated leaf growth. Our microcosm results suggest that in intact rain forest, common AM networks mediate belowground competition and AM fungi may exacerbate iron deficiency, thereby enhancing resistance to E. tetrodonta invasion. Common AM networks–previously unrecognized as contributors to the ashbed effect–probably help to maintain the rain forest–savanna boundary."
https://openalex.org/W1976826236,"Replicative DNA polymerases use a complex, multistep mechanism for efficient and accurate DNA replication as uncovered by intense kinetic and structural studies. Recently, single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy has provided new insights into real time conformational dynamics utilized by DNA polymerases during substrate binding and nucleotide incorporation. We have used single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer techniques to investigate the kinetics and conformational dynamics of Sulfolobus solfataricus DNA polymerase B1 (PolB1) during DNA and nucleotide binding. Our experiments demonstrate that this replicative polymerase can bind to DNA in at least three conformations, corresponding to an open and closed conformation of the finger domain as well as a conformation with the DNA substrate bound to the exonuclease active site of PolB1. Additionally, our results show that PolB1 can transition between these conformations without dissociating from a primer-template DNA substrate. Furthermore, we show that the closed conformation is promoted by a matched incoming dNTP but not by a mismatched dNTP and that mismatches at the primer-template terminus lead to an increase in the binding of the DNA to the exonuclease site. Our analysis has also revealed new details of the biphasic dissociation kinetics of the polymerase-DNA binary complex. Notably, comparison of the results obtained in this study with PolB1 with those from similar single-molecule studies with an A-family DNA polymerase suggests mechanistic differences between these polymerases. In summary, our findings provide novel mechanistic insights into protein conformational dynamics and substrate binding kinetics of a high fidelity B-family DNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W2035252846,"TGF-β1 is a disulfide-bonded homodimeric protein produced by platelets and other cells that plays a role in many physiologic and pathologic processes. TGF-β1 is secreted as an inactive large latent complex (LLC) comprised of TGF-β1, latency-associated peptide, and latent TGF-β binding protein 1. We previously demonstrated that shear force can activate LLC and that thiol-disulfide exchange contributes to the process. We have now investigated the role of thiol isomerases in the activation of LLC in platelet releasates (PR) and recombinant LLC. The wasp venom peptide mastoparan, which inhibits the chaperone activity of PDI, inhibited stirring- and shear-induced activation of latent TGF-β1 by 90 and 75% respectively. To identify the proteins that bind to mastoparan either directly or indirectly, PR were chromatographed on a mastoparan affinity column. Latent TGF-β binding protein 1, latency-associated peptide, TGF-β1, clusterin, von Willebrand factor, multimerin-1, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), ERp5, ERp57, and ERp72 eluted specifically from the column. Anti-PDI RL90 attenuated the inhibitory effect of mastoparan on LLC activation. Furthermore, reduced PDI inhibited activation of PR LLC, whereas oxidized PDI had no effect. We conclude that thiol isomerases and thiol-disulfide exchange contribute to TGF-β1 activation and identify a number of molecules that may participate in the process."
https://openalex.org/W2077105788,"Many signaling molecules and pathways that regulate gap junctions (GJs) protein expression and function are, in fact, also controlled by GJs. We, therefore, speculated an existence of the GJ channel-mediated self-regulation of GJs. Using a cell culture model in which nonjunctional connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannels were activated by cadmium (Cd(2+)), we tested this hypothesis.Incubation of Cx43-transfected LLC-PK1 cells with Cd(2+) led to an increased expression of Cx43. This effect of Cd(2+) was tightly associated with JNK activation. Inhibition of JNK abolished the elevation of Cx43. Further analysis revealed that the changes of JNK and Cx43 were controlled by GSH. Supplement of a membrane-permeable GSH analogue GSH ethyl ester or GSH precursor N-acetyl-cystein abrogated the effects of Cd(2+) on JNK activation and Cx43 expression. Indeed, Cd(2+) induced extracellular release of GSH. Blockade of Cx43 hemichannels with heptanol or Cx43 mimetic peptide Gap26 to prevent the efflux of GSH significantly attenuated the Cx43-elevating effects of Cd(2+).Collectively, our results thus indicate that Cd(2+)-induced upregulation of Cx43 is through activation of nonjunctional Cx43 hemichannels. Our findings thus support the existence of a hemichannel-mediated self-regulation of Cx43 and provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of Cx43 expression and function."

We aim to examine the association of TV time and computer time separately with cardiometabolic biomarkers in young adults. Additionally, the mediating role of waist circumference (WC) is studied. Methods and Findings Data of 634 Dutch young adults (18–28 years; 39% male) were used. Cardiometabolic biomarkers included indicators of overweight, blood pressure, blood levels of fasting plasma insulin, cholesterol, glucose, triglycerides and a clustered cardiometabolic risk score. Linear regression analyses were used to assess the cross-sectional association of self-reported TV and computer time with cardiometabolic biomarkers, adjusting for demographic and lifestyle factors. Mediation by WC was checked using the product-of-coefficient method. TV time was significantly associated with triglycerides (B = 0.004; CI = [0.001;0.05]) and insulin (B = 0.10; CI = [0.01;0.20]). Computer time was not significantly associated with any of the cardiometabolic biomarkers. We found no evidence for WC to mediate the association of TV time or computer time with cardiometabolic biomarkers. Conclusions We found a significantly positive association of TV time with cardiometabolic biomarkers. In addition, we found no evidence for WC as a mediator of this association. Our findings suggest a need to distinguish between TV time and computer time within future guidelines for screen time."
https://openalex.org/W2052787470,"A long-term record of Asian dust storms showed seven high-occurrence-frequency centers in China. The intrusion of Asian dust into the downwind seas, including the China seas, the Sea of Japan, the subarctic North Pacific, the North Pacific subtropical gyre, and the western and eastern Equatorial Pacific, has been shown to add nutrients to ocean ecosystems and enhance their biological activities. To explore the relationship between the transported dust from various sources to the six seas and oceanic biological activities with different nutrient conditions, the correlation between monthly chlorophyll a concentration in each sea and monthly dust storm occurrence frequencies reaching the sea during 1997-2007 was examined in this study. No correlations were observed between dust and chlorophyll a concentration in the <50 m China seas because atmospheric deposition is commonly believed to exert less impact on coastal seas. Significant correlations existed between dust sources and many sea areas, suggesting a link between dust and chlorophyll a concentration in those seas. However, the correlation coefficients were highly variable. In general, the correlation coefficients (0.54-0.63) for the Sea of Japan were highest, except for that between the subarctic Pacific and the Taklimakan Desert, where it was as high as 0.7. For the >50 m China seas and the North Pacific subtropical gyre, the correlation coefficients were in the range 0.32-0.57. The correlation coefficients for the western and eastern Equatorial Pacific were relatively low (<0.36). These correlation coefficients were further interpreted in terms of the geographical distributions of dust sources, the transport pathways, the dust deposition, the nutrient conditions of oceans, and the probability of dust storms reaching the seas."
https://openalex.org/W2114895286,"The excessive accumulation of adipose tissue in the obese state is linked to an altered secretion profile of adipocytes, chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic complications. RBP4 has been implicated in these alterations, especially insulin resistance. The aim of the present study was to determine if a local inflammatory micro-environment in adipose tissue regulates RBP4 expression and secretion.Human SGBS and primary adipocytes cultured with conditioned media from human THP-1 macrophages were used as an in vitro model for adipose inflammation. Adipocytes were exposed to recombinant TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 or IL-8. In addition, coexpression of IL-1β and RBP4 was measured in adipose tissue samples from 18 healthy females. RBP4 expression was studied by quantitative PCR and ELISA.RBP4 mRNA expression and secretion was significantly reduced upon incubation with macrophage-conditioned media in SGBS adipocytes and human primary adipocytes. Out of several factors studied we identified IL-1β as a new factor regulating RBP4. IL-1β significantly downregulated RBP4 mRNA and secretion in a time- and dose-dependent manner. IL-1β mediated its inhibitory effects on RBP4 expression via IL-1 receptor and NF-κB, as incubation with the IL-1 receptor blocking antibody and the NF-κB inhibitors CAPE and SC-514 reversed its effect. Most interestingly, RBP4 mRNA was negatively correlated with IL-1β mRNA in subcutaneous adipose tissue.Adipose tissue inflammation as found in the obese state might lead to a downregulation in local RBP4 levels. IL-1β was identified as a major factor contributing to the decrease in RBP4. The increase in circulating RBP4 that often precedes the development of systemic insulin resistance is most likely unrelated to inflammatory processes in adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2002878525,"Recently large scale transcriptome and proteome datasets for human cells have become available. A striking finding from these studies is that the level of an mRNA typically predicts no more than 40% of the abundance of protein. This correlation represents the overall figure for all genes. We present here a bioinformatic analysis of translation efficiency - the rate at which mRNA is translated into protein. We have analysed those human datasets that include genome wide mRNA and protein levels determined in the same study. The analysis comprises five distinct human cell lines that together provide comparable data for 8,170 genes. For each gene we have used levels of mRNA and protein combined with protein stability data from the HeLa cell line to estimate translation efficiency. This was possible for 3,990 genes in one or more cell lines and 1,807 genes in all five cell lines. Interestingly, our analysis and modelling shows that for many genes this estimated translation efficiency has considerable consistency between cell lines. Some deviations from this consistency likely result from the regulation of protein degradation. Others are likely due to known translational control mechanisms. These findings suggest it will be possible to build improved models for the interpretation of mRNA expression data. The results we present here provide a view of translation efficiency for many genes. We provide an online resource allowing the exploration of translation efficiency in genes of interest within different cell lines (http://bioanalysis.otago.ac.nz/TranslationEfficiency)."
https://openalex.org/W2073704930,"Invasive species often display different patterns of parasite burden and virulence compared to their native counterparts. These differences may be the result of variability in host-parasite co-evolutionary relationships, the occurrence of novel host-parasite encounters, or possibly innate differences in physiological responses to infection between invasive and native hosts. Here we examine the adaptive, humoral immune responses of a resistant, native bird and a susceptible, invasive bird to an arbovirus (Buggy Creek virus; Togaviridae: Alphavirus) and its ectoparasitic arthropod vector (the swallow bug; Oeciacus vicarius). Swallow bugs parasitize the native, colonially nesting cliff swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) and the introduced house sparrow (Passer domesticus) that occupies nests in cliff swallow colonies. We measured levels of BCRV-specific and swallow bug-specific IgY levels before nesting (prior to swallow bug exposure) and after nesting (after swallow bug exposure) in house sparrows and cliff swallows in western Nebraska. Levels of BCRV-specific IgY increased significantly following nesting in the house sparrow but not in the cliff swallow. Additionally, house sparrows displayed consistently higher levels of swallow bug-specific antibodies both before and after nesting compared to cliff swallows. The higher levels of BCRV and swallow bug specific antibodies detected in house sparrows may be reflective of significant differences in both antiviral and anti-ectoparasite immune responses that exist between these two avian species. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the macro- and microparasite-specific immune responses of an invasive and a native avian host exposed to the same parasites."
https://openalex.org/W2021652030,"The intracellular signaling processes controlling malignant B cell migration and tissue localization remain largely undefined. Tandem PH domain-containing proteins TAPP1 and TAPP2 are adaptor proteins that specifically bind to phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate, or PI(3,4)P2, a product of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K). While PI3K enzymes have a number of functions in cell biology, including cell migration, the functions of PI(3,4)P2 and its binding proteins are not well understood. Previously we found that TAPP2 is highly expressed in primary leukemic B cells that have strong migratory capacity. Here we find that SDF-1-dependent migration of human malignant B cells requires both PI3K signaling and TAPP2. Migration in a transwell assay is significantly impaired by pan-PI3K and isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors, or by TAPP2 shRNA knockdown (KD). Strikingly, TAPP2 KD in combination with PI3K inhibitor treatment nearly abolished the migration response, suggesting that TAPP2 may contribute some functions independent of the PI3K pathway. In microfluidic chamber cell tracking assays, TAPP2 KD cells show reduction in percentage of migrating cells, migration velocity and directionality. TAPP2 KD led to alterations in chemokine-induced rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and failure to form polarized morphology. TAPP2 co-localized with the stable F-actin-binding protein utrophin, with both molecules reciprocally localizing against F-actin accumulated at the leading edge upon SDF-1 stimulation. In TAPP2 KD cells, Rac was over-activated and localized to multiple membrane protrusions, suggesting that TAPP2 may act in concert with utrophin and stable F-actin to spatially restrict Rac activation and reduce formation of multiple membrane protrusions. TAPP2 function in cell migration is also apparent in the more complex context of B cell migration into stromal cell layers - a process that is only partially dependent on PI3K and SDF-1. In summary, this study identified TAPP2 as a novel regulator of malignant B cell migration and a potential therapeutic intervention target."
https://openalex.org/W2054652589,"Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiological agent of multicentric Castleman’s disease, primary effusion lymphoma and Kaposi’s sarcoma. In this study, we show that like the C-type lectin DC-SIGN, the closely related DC-SIGNR can also enhance KSHV infection. Following infection, they are both targeted for down modulation and our data indicate that the KSHV MARCH-family ubiquitin ligase K5 is mediating this regulation and subsequent targeting for degradation of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR in the context of the virus. The closely related viral K3 protein, is also able to target these lectins in exogenous expressions studies, but only weakly during viral infection. In addition to requiring a functional RING-CH domain, several protein trafficking motifs in the C-terminal region of both K3 and K5 are important in regulation of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. Further exploration of this modulation revealed that DC-SIGN is endocytosed from the cell surface in THP-1 monocytes, but degraded from an internal location with minimal endocytosis in HEK-293 cells. Pull-down data indicate that both K3 and K5 preferentially associate with immature forms of the lectins, mediating their ubiquitylation and degradation. Together, these data emphasize the molecular complexities of K3 and K5, while expanding the repertoire of targets of these two viral proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2080559727,"Over the past years, we synthesized a series of new molecules that are hybrids of spirocyclic ketones as complexity-bearing cores with bi- and ter-phenyls as privileged fragments. Some of these newly-shaped small molecules showed antiproliferative, pro-apoptotic and differentiating activity in leukemia cell lines. In the present study, to investigate more in depth the mechanisms of action of these molecules, the protein expression profiles of K562 cells treated with or without the compounds IND_S1, MEL_T1, IND_S7 and MEL_S3 were analyzed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry. Proteome comparisons revealed several differentially expressed proteins, mainly related to cellular metabolism, chaperone activity, cytoskeletal organization and RNA biogenesis. The major results were validated by Western blot and qPCR. To attempt integrating findings into a cellular signaling context, proteomic data were explored using MetaCore. Network analysis highlighted relevant relationships between the identified proteins and additional potential effectors. Notably, qPCR validation of central hubs showed that the compound MEL_S3 induced high mRNA levels of the transcriptional factors EGR1 and HNF4-alpha; the latter to our knowledge is reported here for the first time to be present in K562 cells. Consistently with the known EGR1 involvement in the regulation of differentiation along megakaryocyte lineage, MEL_S3-treated leukemia cells showed a marked expression of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (CD41) and glycoprotein Ib (CD42), two important cell markers in megakaryocytic differentiation, together with morphological aspects of megakaryoblasts and megakaryocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1975590117,"We previously showed that a truncation mutant of CFTR missing the first four transmembrane segments of TMD1, Δ264 CFTR, binds to key elements in the ER quality control mechanism to increase the amounts of the mature C band of both wt and ΔF508 CFTR through transcomplementation. Here, we created a new construct, Δ27–264 CFTR. Even though Δ27–264 CFTR is rapidly degraded in the proteasome, steady state protein can be detected by Western blot. Δ27–264 CFTR can also increase the amounts of the mature C band of both wt and ΔF508 CFTR through transcomplementation. Electrophysiology experiments show that Δ27–264 CFTR can restore chloride channel currents. Further experiments with the conduction mutant S341A show conclusively that currents are indeed generated by rescued channel function of ΔF508 CFTR. Immunoprecipitation studies show that Δ27–264 binds to ΔF508-CFTR, suggesting a bimolecular interaction. Thus the adeno-associated viral vector, rAAV-Δ27–264 CFTR, is a highly promising CF gene therapy vector, because it increases the amount of mature band C protein both from wt and ΔF508 CFTR, and rescues channel activity of ΔF508 CFTR.

https://openalex.org/W2028958271,"To identify a novel pathogenic gene mutation present in a Chinese family with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and to determine if an intron mutation may influence the transcriptional activity of the ACVRL1 gene.HHT family members were ascertained following the presentation of proband and involved subjects. All family members (n = 5) and 113 healthy individuals were genotyped for the variant in intron 6 c.772+27G>C of ACVRL1 gene. The genomic structure of ACVRL1 in affected HHT patients and healthy individuals was determined by long range PCR and sequencing. The expression of ACVRL1 mRNA and protein in patients with HHT was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis. Luciferase activity assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were performed to uncover the mechanism of intron-related transcriptional regulation.Only one novel mutation in intron 6 (c.772+27G>C) of ACVRL1 gene, no other mutation, abnormal splice, gross genomic deletion or rearrangement was found in this HHT2 family. Compared with healthy individuals, ACVRL1 mRNA and protein were significantly decreased in affected HHT2 individuals. Luciferase activity assay demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of the mutated ACVRL1 was significantly lower than that of the wild-type of intron 6; EMSA results showed that intron 6 c.772+27G>C mutation was able to inhibit the binding of transcriptional factor Sp1.A novel intron mutation in ACVRL1 gene is associated with familial HHT2. The mechanisms may be involved in the down-regulation of ACVRL1 gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2029489050,"The condensed structure of chromatin limits access of cellular machinery towards template DNA. This in turn represses essential processes like transcription, replication, repair and recombination. The repression is alleviated by a variety of energy dependent processes, collectively known as ""chromatin remodeling"". In a eukaryotic cell, a fine balance between condensed and de-condensed states of chromatin helps to maintain an optimum level of gene expression. DNA binding small molecules have the potential to perturb such equilibrium. We present herein the study of an oligopeptide antibiotic distamycin, which binds to the minor groove of B-DNA. Chromatin mobility assays and circular dichroism spectroscopy have been employed to study the effect of distamycin on chromatosomes, isolated from the liver of Sprague-Dawley rats. Our results show that distamycin is capable of remodeling both chromatosomes and reconstituted nucleosomes, and the remodeling takes place in an ATP-independent manner. Binding of distamycin to the linker and nucleosomal DNA culminates in eviction of the linker histone and the formation of a population of off-centered nucleosomes. This hints at a possible corkscrew type motion of the DNA with respect to the histone octamer. Our results indicate that distamycin in spite of remodeling chromatin, inhibits transcription from both DNA and chromatin templates. Therefore, the DNA that is made accessible due to remodeling is either structurally incompetent for transcription, or bound distamycin poses a roadblock for the transcription machinery to advance."
https://openalex.org/W2022340849,"Different regulatory elements function are involved in plant virus gene expression and replication by long-distance RNA-RNA interactions. A cap-independent functional element of the Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) - like translational enhancer (BTE) is present in Tobacco necrosis virus A (TNV-A), a Necrovirus member in the Tombusviridae family. In this paper, an RNA stretch flanking the 5' proximal end of the TNV-A(C) coat protein (CP) gene was shown to be essential for viral replication in Chenopodium amaranticolor plants and tobacco cells. This internal sequence functioned in transient expression of β-glucuronidase (GUS) when present at either the 5' or 3' sides of the GUS open reading frame. Serial deletion analyses revealed that nine nucleotides from nt 2609 to 2617 (-3 to +6 of the CP initiation site) within TNV-A(C) RNA are indispensable for viral replication in whole plants and tobacco cells. Fusion of this RNA element in mRNAs translated in tobacco cells resulted in a remarkable enhancement of luciferase expression from in vitro synthesised chimaeric RNAs or DNA expression vectors. Interestingly, the element also exhibited increased translational activity when fused downstream of the reporter genes, although the efficiency was lower than with upstream fusions. These results provide evidence that an internal RNA element in the genomic (g) RNA of TNV-A(C), ranging approximately from nt 2543 to 2617, plays a bifunctional role in viral replication and translation enhancement during infection, and that this element may use novel strategies differing from those previously reported for other viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1978433397,"Opportunities for associationist learning of word meaning, where a word is heard or read contemperaneously with information being available on its meaning, are considered too infrequent to account for the rate of language acquisition in children. It has been suggested that additional learning could occur in a distributional mode, where information is gleaned from the distributional statistics (word co-occurrence etc.) of natural language. Such statistics are relevant to meaning because of the Distributional Principle that 'words of similar meaning tend to occur in similar contexts'. Computational systems, such as Latent Semantic Analysis, have substantiated the viability of distributional learning of word meaning, by showing that semantic similarities between words can be accurately estimated from analysis of the distributional statistics of a natural language corpus. We consider whether appearance similarities can also be learnt in a distributional mode. As grounds for such a mode we advance the Appearance Hypothesis that 'words with referents of similar appearance tend to occur in similar contexts'. We assess the viability of such learning by looking at the performance of a computer system that interpolates, on the basis of distributional and appearance similarity, from words that it has been explicitly taught the appearance of, in order to identify and name objects that it has not been taught about. Our experiment tests with a set of 660 simple concrete noun words. Appearance information on words is modelled using sets of images of examples of the word. Distributional similarity is computed from a standard natural language corpus. Our computation results support the viability of distributional learning of appearance."
https://openalex.org/W2021634357,"Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes form around nascent RNA during transcription to facilitate proper transcriptional elongation, RNA processing, and nuclear export. RNPs are highly heterogeneous, and different types of RNPs tend to package functionally related transcripts. These observations have inspired the hypothesis that RNP mediated mechanisms help specify coordinated gene expression. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that mutations in RNP components can cause defects in specific developmental pathways. How RNP biogenesis itself is regulated, however, is not well understood. The evolutionarily conserved THO RNP complex functions early during transcription to package nascent transcripts and facilitate subsequent RNP biogenesis. THO deficiency compromises transcriptional elongation as well as RNP mediated events like 3' end formation and nuclear export for some transcripts. Using molecularly manipulated cells and in vitro reconstituted biochemical reactions, we demonstrate that the essential THO protein component encoded by the Thoc1 gene is poly-ubiquitinated by the NEDD4-1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Poly-ubiquitinated pThoc1 is degraded by the proteasome. These results indicate THO activity is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and that this regulation is evolutionarily conserved between yeast and mammals. Manipulation of NEDD4-1 levels has modest effects on Thoc1 protein levels under steady state conditions, but destabilization of Thoc1 protein upon treatment with a transcriptional elongation inhibitor is dependent on NEDD4-1. This suggests NEDD4-1 functions in conjunction with other post-translational mechanisms to regulate Thoc1 protein and THO activity."
