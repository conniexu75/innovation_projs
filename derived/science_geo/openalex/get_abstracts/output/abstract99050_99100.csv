https://openalex.org/W2065169750,"An in situ study of mRNAs encoding NMDA receptor subunits in the developing rat CNS revealed that, at all stages, the NR1 gene is expressed in virtually all neurons, whereas the four NR2 transcripts display distinct expression patterns. NR2B and NR2D mRNAs occur prenatally, whereas NR2A and NR2C mRNAs are first detected near birth. All transcripts except NR2D peak around P20. NR2D mRNA, present mainly in midbrain structures, peaks around P7 and thereafter decreases to adult levels. Postnatally, NR2B and NR2C transcript levels change in opposite directions in the cerebellar internal granule cell layer. In the adult hippocampus, NR2A and NR2B mRNAs are prominent in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells, but NR2C and NR2D mRNAs occur in different subsets of interneurons. Recombinant binary NR1-NR2 channels show comparable Ca2+ permeabilities, but marked differences in voltage-dependent Mg2+ block and in offset decay time constants. Thus, the distinct expression profiles and functional properties of NR2 subunits provide a basis for NMDA channel heterogeneity in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W2012792646,"Signaling by tyrosine kinase receptors is mediated by selective interactions between individual Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of cytoplasmic effectors and specific phosphotyrosine residues in the activated receptor. Here, we report the existence in the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) receptor of a multifunctional docking site made of the tandemly arranged degenerate sequence YVH/NV. Phosphorylation of this site mediates intermediate- to high-affinity interactions with multiple SH2-containing signal transducers, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase C gamma, pp60c-src, and the GRB-2-Sos complex. Mutation of the two tyrosines results in loss of biological function, as shown by abrogation of the transforming activity in the oncogenic counterpart of the receptor. The same bidentate motif is conserved in the evolutionarily related receptors Sea and Ron, suggesting that in all members of the HGF/SF receptor family, signal transduction is channeled through a multifunctional binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2002038445,"Of several thousand peptides presented by the major histocompatibility molecule HLA-A2.1, at least nine are recognized by melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify and to sequence one of these peptide epitopes. Melanoma-specific CTLs had an exceptionally high affinity for this nine-residue peptide, which reconstituted an epitope for CTL lines from each of five different melanoma patients tested. Recognition by multiple CTL lines suggests that this may be a promising candidate for use in peptide-based melanoma vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2006417453,"Slug, a vertebrate gene encoding a zinc finger protein of the Snail family, is expressed in the neural crest and in mesodermal cells emigrating from the primitive streak. Early chick embryos were incubated with antisense oligonucleotides to chick Slug. These oligonucleotides specifically inhibit the normal change in cell behavior that occurs at the two sites in the emerging body plan in which the gene is expressed. This change, which is the transition from epithelial to mesenchymal character, occurs at the formation of mesoderm during gastrulation and on emigration of the neutral crest from the neural tube."

https://openalex.org/W2093759370,"We have examined NGF-induced signal transduction events and neuronal differentiation in MAH cells, a neuronal progenitor cell line, in which the expression of the two NGF receptors, p140trk (Trk) and p75LNGFR (p75), has been independently manipulated. Coexpression of a large molar excess of p75 substantially enhances the NGF-induced tyrosine autophosphorylation of Trk, compared with cells expressing Trk alone. MAH cells expressing both Trk and p75 stop dividing and acquire a mature neuronal morphology more rapidly and with greater efficiency than MAH cells expressing Trk alone. These biochemical and biological influences of p75 are not observed using a mutant form of NGF that binds Trk but not p75. These data provide evidence that p75 can modulate signal transduction through Trk in a neuronal progenitor cell context and that such modulation has functional consequences for the neuronal differentiation pathway induced by NGF."
https://openalex.org/W1608821961,"Abstract Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), and interleukin-6 (IL6) compose a family of distantly related cytokines that initiate signaling by inducing either homodimerization of the signal transducing receptor component gp130 (in the case of IL6) or heterodimerization between gp130 and the gp130-related LIFR beta (in the case of CNTF, LIF, and OSM); dimerization of beta receptor components in turn activates members of the Jak/Tyk family of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases. Here we report that CNTF, LIF, OSM, and IL6 induce most of the same protein tyrosine phosphorylations, regardless of the cell type assayed or whether they initiate signaling by inducing homo- or heterodimerization of beta components. Although several of the protein tyrosine phosphorylations induced by the CNTF/LIF/OSM/IL6 family of factors may correspond to novel tyrosine kinase targets, we have been able to demonstrate the involvement of known signaling molecules, such as phospholipase C gamma, phosphoinositol 3-kinase, phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP1D), pp120, SHC, GRB2, STAT91, Raf-1, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2, revealing substantial convergence not only between the pathways activated by this cytokine family and other cytokines, but with pathways previously known to be activated only by factors that utilize receptor tyrosine kinases. Our data suggest the beta receptor components can form complexes with some of the signaling proteins identified and may play some role in their recruitment."

https://openalex.org/W2060257987,"Depolarization-induced intracellular Ca2+ rises were measured in fura-2-loaded, voltage-clamped Purkinje cells. The peak Ca2+ rise increased more than linearly with voltage step duration, suggesting the presence of Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release. In cells from young animals, in which Ca2+ currents could be satisfactorily recorded, a supralinear relation was also found between peak Ca2+ rise and Ca2+ current integral. Responses to long pulses were inhibited in cells dialyzed with 20 microM ruthenium red and potentiated in cells bathed in the presence of 20 microM ryanodine. Upon repetitive depolarization, increasing Ca2+ rises were elicited by successive voltage pulses, probably because of a potentiating effect of residual Ca2+. Altogether, the results indicate an important contribution of Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release to Ca2+ signals of Purkinje cells."
https://openalex.org/W1988651587,"The nonreceptor tyrosine protein kinases pp60c-src, p59fyn, and pp62c-yes are localized in growth cones of developing neurons, but their function is undefined. To determine whether these tyrosine kinases were capable of regulating substrate-dependent axon growth, cultures of cerebellar neurons from wild-type, src-, fyn-, and yes- mice were analyzed for neurite outgrowth on the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 or the extracellular matrix protein laminin. The rate of neurite extension on L1 was reduced in src-, but not in fyn- or yes- neurons. Neurite extension on laminin was unaltered in src-, fyn-, or yes- neurons, indicating that pp60c-src, p59fyn, or pp62c-yes is not likely to participate in integrin-dependent axon growth. These results demonstrate that pp60c-src is a component of the intracellular signaling pathway in L1-mediated axonal growth and suggest that Src-related nonreceptor tyrosine kinases may have distinct, nonredundant functions in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2060860860,"c-Abl is a tyrosine kinase localized primarily in the nucleus. Previous assays for abl function rely on cellular transformation by abl mutants, which are cytoplasmic. Using a conditional overexpression strategy, we have developed a functional assay for c-abl. Overexpression of c-abl inhibits growth by causing cell cycle arrest. Growth suppression requires tyrosine kinase activity, nuclear localization, and an intact SH2 domain. Overexpression of dominant negative c-abl disrupts cell cycle control and enhances transformation by tyrosine kinases, G proteins, and transcription factor oncogenes. These findings suggest that c-abl acts as a negative regulator of cell growth. This growth suppressive activity is functionally similar to that of tumor suppressor genes such as p53 and Rb."
https://openalex.org/W2070193133,"Proteolipid protein (PLP) is an integral membrane protein of CNS myelin. Mutations of the X chromosome-linked PLP gene cause glial cell death and myelin deficiency in jimpy mice and other neurological mutants. As part of an attempt to rescue these mutants by transgenic complementation, we generated normal mouse lines expressing autosomal copies of the entire wild-type PLP gene. Surprisingly, increase of the PLP gene dosage in nonmutant mice with only 2-fold transcriptional overexpression results in a novel phenotype characterized by severe hypomyelination and astrocytosis, seizures, and premature death. This demonstrates that precise control of the PLP gene is a critical determinant of terminal oligodendrocyte differentiation. Dysmyelination of PLP transgenic mice provides experimental evidence that Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, previously associated with a partial duplication of the human X chromosome, can be caused by doubling of the PLP gene dosage."

https://openalex.org/W1982011740,"For cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channels to open, they must be phosphorylated by protein kinase A and then exposed to a hydrolyzable nucleoside triphosphate, such as ATP. To test whether channel opening is linked to ATP hydrolysis, we applied VO4 and BeF3 to CFTR channels in inside-out patches excised from cardiac myocytes. These inorganic phosphate analogs interrupt ATP hydrolysis cycles by binding tightly in place of the released hydrolysis product, inorganic phosphate. The analogs acted only on CFTR channels opened by ATP and locked them open, increasing their mean open time by 2–3 orders of magnitude. These findings establish that opening and closing of CFTR channels are coupled to an ATP hydrolysis cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1568633684,"Fibronectin (Fn) binding to the integrins alpha IIb beta 3 and alpha v beta 3 involves the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence. The identification of other regions of Fn that interact with alpha IIb beta 3 suggests a potential mechanism for differential ligand recognition by integrins. We report here the identification of an 11-residue peptide sequence from the 9th type III repeat of Fn (3Fn9), which inhibits ligand binding to alpha IIb beta 3 by interacting directly with this receptor. Mutational analysis demonstrated that this same region was involved in the formation of epitopes for two anti-Fn mAbs that inhibit Fn binding to alpha IIb beta 3, thus emphasizing the role of this site in the macromolecule. Molecular modeling of the 3Fn9-10 modules suggested that Fn residues Asp1373-Thr1383 are at least 25 A distant from the Arg-Gly-Asp site and therefore does not directly interact with it. The 3Fn9 site was differentially recognized by the beta 3 integrin family. The Asp1373-Thr1383 peptide failed to inhibit ligand binding to alpha v beta 3, a recombinant Fn Ala1235-Ser1436 fragment was not recognized by alpha v beta 3, and addition of the 3Fn9 module to the amino terminus of the 3Fn10 did not affect the potency of inhibition of Fn binding to alpha v beta 3. Thus, a novel integrin recognition site in the 3Fn9 module of Fn that is differentially recognized by the beta 3 integrins has been localized within the residues Asp1373-Thr1383."
https://openalex.org/W1482422136,"We examined the possibility that the C2 domain, amino acid residues 2173-2332, of factor VIII (fVIII) contains a binding site for von Willebrand factor (vWf) to clarify previous data showing that some monoclonal and human inhibitor antibodies with epitopes in C2 prevent fVIII-vWf binding. We constructed a fusion protein, glutathione S-transferase-C2, which binds to immobilized vWf in a dose-dependent saturable fashion, suggesting that the fVIII C2 domain contains a binding site for vWf. This site was further localized by testing the effect of a synthetic peptide on fVIII-vWf binding. Peptide 2303-2332, consisting of a previously identified phosphatidyl-serine binding site, prevented fVIII binding to vWf, suggesting that the sites for fVIII binding to vWf or phosphatidylserine have some overlap. The effect of anti-C2 domain antibodies further supported these observations. The inhibition of fVIII binding to vWf by monoclonal antibody NMC-VIII/5 IgG or F(ab)'2 (epitope within residues 2170-2327) and by inhibitor antibody MU IgG or Fab' (epitope within residues 2248-2312) was demonstrated by a fluid-phase binding assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Two monoclonal antibodies with epitopes within amino acid residues 2170-2218 or 2248-2285, which do not overlap the phosphatidylserine binding site, did not have any inhibitory effect. Our data suggest that the previously described antagonistic binding of vWf and phospholipid to fVIII is due to the involvement of some C2 domain amino acids in both processes."
https://openalex.org/W1602804242,"Fibronectin (FN)-mediated cell adhesion is controlled mainly by alpha 5 beta 1 (recognizing the RGD sequence) and alpha 4 beta 1 (recognizing the CS-1 peptide sequence of FN) integrin receptors. Integrin-dependent cell adhesion to FN is greatly promoted by optimal GM3 concentration at the surface membrane (Zheng, M., Fang, H., Tsuruoka, T., Tsuji, T., Sasaki, T., and Hakomori, S. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2217-2222), and cell adhesion mediated by alpha 4 beta 1 (to FN) or alpha 6 beta 1 (to laminin) is inhibited by modifying N-glycosylation processing of the integrin receptor (e.g. Akiyama, S. K., Yamada, S. S., and Yamada, K. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 18011-18018). We therefore studied the specific role of N-glycosylation in alpha 5 beta 1 function. Key findings of the present study were as follows. (i) Adhesion of K562 cells to FN-coated plates, which is mediated solely by alpha 5 beta 1, was inhibited when cells were treated with a mixture of endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase F and peptide -N4-(N-acetylglucosaminyl)asparagine amidase F (endo-F/PNGase-F). (ii) The alpha 5 beta 1 receptor at the K562 cell surface tended to dissociate into alpha 5 and beta 1 subunits when an extract of cells treated with endo-F/PNGase-F was precipitated by integrin subunit-specific antibodies, i.e. the alpha 5 subunit was preferentially precipitated by anti-alpha 5 monoclonal antibody ZH5, and the beta 1 subunit was preferentially precipitated by anti-beta 1 monoclonal antibody ZH1. When intact cells were extracted and treated with either ZH5 or ZH1, both alpha 5 and beta 1 were coprecipitated, indicating that the two subunits are normally tightly associated with each other. (iii) Adhesion of alpha 5 beta 1-containing liposomes (phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol liposomes incorporating purified alpha 5 beta 1) to FN-coated plates was abolished by treatment of liposomes with endo-F/PNGase-F. Liposomes incorporating alpha 5 beta 1 pretreated with endo-F/PNGase-F also did not bind to FN. When purified alpha 5 beta 1 receptor was treated with endo-F/PNGase-F followed by ZH5 or ZH1, the alpha 5 or beta 1 subunit was precipitated separately, respectively. In contrast, both subunits were always coprecipitated when intact purified alpha 5 beta 1 receptor was directly treated with ZH5 or ZH1. These findings indicate that N-glycosylation of both the alpha and beta subunits of the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin receptor is essential for association of these subunits and for optimal binding to FN."
https://openalex.org/W2080347647,"Subsets of axons in the embryonic nervous system transiently express the glycoprotein TAG-1, a member of the subfamily of immunoglobulin (Ig)-like proteins that contain both C2 class Ig and fibronectin type III domains. TAG-1 is attached to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage and is secreted by neurons. In vitro studies have shown that substrate-bound TAG-1 promotes neurite outgrowth. We have examined the nature of axonal receptors that mediate the neurite-outgrowth promoting properties of TAG-1. Although TAG-1 can mediate homophilic binding, neurite out-growth on a substrate of TAG-1 does not depend on the presence of TAG-1 on the axonal surface. Instead, neurite outgrowth on TAG-1 is inhibited by polyclonal antibodies directed against L1 and, independently, by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against β1-containing integrins. These results provide evidence that TAG-1 can interact with cell surfaces in both a homophilic and heterophilic manner and suggest that neurite extension on TAG-1 requires the function of both integrins and an L1-like molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1556795890,"The mechanism of activation of the agonist-stimulated Ca2+ entry pathway in the plasma membrane is not known. To determine the role of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) and cGMP in the regulation of this pathway, we used intact and streptolysin O (SLO)-permeable pancreatic acini and measured the relationship between Ca2+ release from internal stores, the NO metabolic pathway, generation of cGMP, and activation of Ca2+ entry. We found that agonist- or thapsigargin (Tg)-activated Ca2+ entry is inhibited by L-NA, a specific inhibitor of NOS, and by LY83583, an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase. Inhibition of Ca2+ entry by inhibition of NOS was reversed by the NO releasing molecules NO2- and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and by Bt2cGMP. Inhibition of Ca2+ entry by inhibition of guanylyl cyclase was reversed by Bt2cGMP, but not by the NO releasing agents. The use of L-NA-treated cells and different concentrations of SNP revealed that cGMP has a dual effect on Ca2+ entry. Increasing cGMP up to 10-fold above control activated Ca2+ entry. Further increase in cGMP up to 80-fold above control inhibited Ca2+ entry in a concentration-dependent manner. Measurement of cellular cGMP in intact cells showed that carbachol, Tg, and NO2- increased cGMP to similar levels. The effects of carbachol and Tg were inhibited by L-NA and LY83586, whereas the effect of NO2- was inhibited only by LY83583. SLO-permeabilized cells were shown to be agonist-competent in that the agonist induced Ca2+ release from the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) pool and activated a NO-dependent generation of cGMP. These cells were used to study the regulation of NOS by Ca2+ and by Ca2+ content of the internal stores. When internal stores were maintained loaded with Ca2+, increasing medium [Ca2+] up to 2.5 microM only modestly increased NOS activity. In contrast, the depletion of Ca2+ from internal stores markedly increased NOS activity independent of medium [Ca2+]. Thus, NOS senses both cytosolic [Ca2+]i and internal store Ca2+ load. We propose that activation of Ca2+ entry involves an agonist-mediated Ca2+ release from internal stores which activates a cellular pool of NOS to generate cGMP, which then modulates Ca2+ entry pathway in the plasma membrane. This mechanism can explain the capacitative nature of Ca2+ entry. The biphasic effect of cGMP provides the cells with a negative feedback mechanism which inhibits Ca2+ entry during periods of high cell [Ca2+]i. This could allow oscillatory behavior of Ca2+ entry."

https://openalex.org/W1480283710,"hGBP1 is an interferon-induced 67-kDa protein of human cells that readily binds to agarose-immobilized GTP, GDP, and GMP but not to other nucleotides. We cloned hGBP1 cDNA into a histidine-tagging vector, produced recombinant hGBP1 with 6 extra histidine residues at its N terminus in Escherichia coli, and purified this protein to near homogeneity from bacterial lysates. Purified hGBP1 hydrolyzed radiolabeled GTP but failed to hydrolyze ATP, UTP, or CTP at significant rates. Unexpectedly, the principal product of the GTP hydrolysis reaction was GMP rather than GDP. Although significant amounts of GDP were produced when the reaction was performed at 15 degrees C, GDP could not serve as substrate or as inhibitor of hGBP1. hGBP1 lacked guanylate cyclase and guanylyltransferase activity. Degradation of GTP to GMP most likely occurred via two consecutive cleavages of single phosphate groups, because pyrophosphate was not a reaction product, and because hGBP1 failed to hydrolyze GTP gamma S. In vitro modification assays with radiolabeled mevalonic acid and farnesyl pyrophosphate showed that the CaaX motif at the C terminus of hGBP1 functions as an isoprenylation signal. Thus, hGBP1 is a GTPase with novel biochemical properties that may be membrane-associated in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1531374158,"We have previously shown in cultured cerebellar granule neurons (Lafon-Cazal, M., Pietri, S., Culcasi, M., and Bockaert, J. (1993) Nature 364, 535-537) that upon N-methyl-D-aspartate stimulation, a nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-independent, arachidonic acid-dependent generation of superoxide free radicals (O2-.) is observed after a lag time of 10-15 min. Using the electron spin resonance spin trapping technique, we show that N-methyl-D-aspartate stimulation produced a more rapid burst of O2-. in L-arginine (L-Arg)-depleted neurons. These O2-. radicals are synthesized by NOS. KCl and kainate, which also stimulated NOS in these neurons, produced this rapid burst of O2-., which was blocked as follows: (a) in the presence of L-NG-nitro-arginine (L-Narg), and (b) by L-Arg repletion. This burst of O2-. was arachidonic acid-independent, and its time course was similar to that of nitric oxide production. It was also responsible for a weak but significant cell death that was suppressed by L-Narg and L-Arg."
https://openalex.org/W1522963066,"In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulated nitric oxide (NO) production via the expression of an inducible type of NO synthase (iNOS). A potent vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II (Ang II), which causes a rapid phospholipase C-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis via the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor in VSMC, by itself did not stimulate the production of nitrite, a stable metabolite of NO, but dose dependently inhibited the IL-1 beta-induced nitrite production. This inhibitory effect of Ang II was blocked by an AT1 receptor antagonist, CV-11974, but not by an Ang II type 2 receptor antagonist, PD 123319. The presence of Ang II during the early induction phase of iNOS was required for this inhibition. Consistently, Ang II suppressed IL-1 beta-induced increases in iNOS mRNA and protein levels. Ang II also inhibited increases in nitrite production and iNOS mRNA and protein levels caused by tumor necrosis factor alpha. A protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and a membrane-permeable diacylglycerol, 1,2-dioctanoyl-glycerol, similarly inhibited the IL-1 beta-induced nitrite production and iNOS mRNA and protein expression, although repetitive additions were needed in the case of diacylglycerol. These results indicate that Ang II negatively modulates cytokine-induced NO production by blocking iNOS expression via the AT1 receptor in VSMC and suggest that protein kinase C could be involved in this process."
https://openalex.org/W1516227220,"Cystic fibrosis is a major inherited disorder involving abnormalities of fluid and electrolyte transport in a number of different organs. Epithelial cells of cystic fibrosis patients have a decreased capacity to secrete chloride in response to cAMP-mobilizing agents because of the mutation of a single gene. The gene product, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator or CFTR, is a chloride channel. The most frequent mutation is a deletion of phenylalanine in position 508 (delta F508-CFTR) that reduces both the expression of the CFTR protein at the cell surface, and the activity of the Cl- channel. This work presents the properties of NS004, a substituted benzimidazolone, which is the first activator of normal and mutant CFTR-associated chloride channels to be described. NS004 activated CFTR and delta F508-CFTR Cl- channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and increased 125I efflux (via the Cl- channel) from Vero cells expressing CFTR and delta F508-CFTR. Application of NS004 to the external side of outside-out patches excised from these CFTR- and delta F508-CFTR-expressing cells induced a marked and reversible increase in channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W1482079857,"alpha 2-Macroglobulin (alpha 2M)-methylamine binds to purified low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), and it is assumed that LRP functions as the alpha 2M receptor in vivo. Binding of alpha 2M-methylamine to macrophage receptors elevates intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), inositol phosphates, and cyclic AMP. We have employed human alpha 2M-methylamine and recombinant receptor binding fragment (RBF) to study transduction mechanisms. Macrophages exposed to either ligand demonstrated a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i. Since the 39-kDa LRP/alpha 2M receptor-associated protein (RAP) blocks alpha 2M binding to LRP, we explored the effects of RAP upon signaling. Pretreatment of macrophages with RAP did not block the increase in [Ca2+]i elicited by alpha 2M-methylamine or RBF, suggesting a distinct binding site. RBF also elicited a transient 1.5-2.0-fold increase in inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate. In permeabilized macrophages, GTP gamma S and Gp-p(NH)p potentiated and sustained this inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate increase. Preincubation of permeabilized macrophages with GDP beta S abrogated the effects of GTP gamma S. Our results suggest that the signaling alpha 2M receptor is coupled to a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein and possibly to a cholera toxin-sensitive G protein. We conclude that macrophages contain a second alpha 2M receptor that is G protein-coupled."
https://openalex.org/W1526496445,"We have investigated which integrins mediate the elevation of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) triggered by spreading of endothelial cells on fibronectin (FN). Specific anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies immobilized on glass surfaces were used as agonists to trigger cell spreading. These experiments demonstrated that an antibody to alpha v could induce the rise in [Ca2+]i, whereas two antibodies to alpha 5 beta 1 were inactive, despite their ability to induce cell spreading and elevation of intracellular pH. Antibodies in solution were then used as agonists to block association of specific integrins with FN. These experiments also showed that alpha v integrin(s) but not alpha 5 beta 1 mediated the rise in [Ca2+]i in cells spreading on FN. Adhesion assays in the presence of function-blocking anti-integrin antibodies and affinity chromatography on FN columns of surface-labeled cell extracts were carried out to characterize the integrins that bind to FN. Both methods showed that alpha v integrin(s) and alpha 5 beta 1 participate in FN binding; however, the contribution from alpha v integrin(s) was much less than that of alpha 5 beta 1. These results demonstrate that two receptors for FN on the same cells can trigger distinct intracellular signaling pathways and, furthermore, that an integrin whose contribution to adhesion is barely detectable can have a major effect on cellular responses. The results also suggest that the specificity for activation of the calcium signaling pathway resides primarily in the integrin alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1509605247,"Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is unique among the nitric oxide synthase family of proteins due to the presence of an N-myristoylation consensus sequence elucidated from the cloning of its cDNA. Although eNOS was metabolically labeled with [3H]myristic acid and mutation of glycine 2 in the N-myristoylation consensus sequence changed the particulate localization of the enzyme to a cytosolic form, the definitive characterization of eNOS as an N-myristoylprotein has not been demonstrated. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine the nature of the fatty acid incorporated into eNOS. Wild-type or G2A mutant (mutation of glycine 2, the myristic acid acceptor site, to alanine) eNOS-transfected COS cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were metabolically labeled with [3H]myristic acid for 5 h. The radiolabel was primarily incorporated into membrane-associated eNOS from wild-type transfected COS cells and cultured BAEC but not into the mutant eNOS from G2A-transfected COS cells. Qualitatively similar amounts of immunoreactive protein were found in wild-type and G2A-transfected cells. In addition, linkage of the radiolabel to eNOS was insensitive to hydroxylamine treatment, and incorporation of the radiolabel into eNOS was abolished by cyclo-heximide. Chemical analysis of the fatty acid released by acid methanolysis of labeled eNOS verified the 3H-labeled fatty acid as protein-bound myristic acid. These results unequivocally demonstrate that eNOS incorporates myristic acid via an amide linkage with the amino-terminal glycine of the enzyme as a co-translational modification."
https://openalex.org/W1595795928,"We are investigating the role of gamma-chain in functions mediated by the high affinity Fc receptor for IgG (Fc gamma RI). In a previous study, we found that gamma-chain, which is a member of the family of zeta-chain proteins, associates with Fc gamma RI. Here we show that clustering of Fc gamma RI leads to a rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of gamma-chain in U937 cells. The response was limited to Fc gamma RI activation, and no phosphorylation of gamma-chain was observed after cross-linking of monoclonal antibodies to other surface receptors on these cells. The gamma-chain phosphorylated after Fc gamma RI clustering was the gamma-chain associated with the receptor. We also identified Syk as one of the kinases associated with the receptor complex. Upon Fc gamma RI activation, Syk, but not ZAP-70, was phosphorylated, and reimmunoadsorption experiments of phosphoproteins from immune complex in vitro kinase assays indicated that Syk is part of the activated gamma-chain-Fc gamma RI complex. These results suggest that gamma-chain links Fc gamma RI to intracellular transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1513412079,"Stimulation of B lymphocytes by the cross-linking of surface Ig (sIg) with an F(ab')2 antibody fragment leads to the rapid activation of several tyrosine kinases. This gives rise to the activation of phospholipase C gamma (PLC gamma) and the generation of inositol phosphates. These, in turn, lead to a prolonged elevation of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) consisting of a rapid release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and a sustained influx of extracellular Ca2+. In contrast, co-cross-linking sIg to Fc gamma receptor (Fc gamma RII) with intact anti-sIg induces a much more transient increase in [Ca2+]i. Stimulation of the murine B cell lymphoma, A20, with F(ab')2 anti-sIgG leads to the production of high levels of IL-2, while co-cross-linking of sIgG with Fc gamma RII blocks this response. In studies reported here, we show that co-cross-linking of Fc gamma RII with sIg prevents the influx of extracellular Ca2+ without significantly affecting the tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates including PLC gamma 1, PLC gamma 2, and Syk or the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. In cells that had been previously activated with F(ab')2 anti-IgG, co-cross-linking of sIg to Fc gamma RII rapidly abrogated the influx of extracellular Ca2+ by closing the plasma membrane Ca2+ channel. Additionally, even 2-3 h after stimulation of the cells with F(ab')2 fragment, addition of intact anti-IgG to the cells, or removal of extracellular Ca2+, markedly inhibited (> 90%) IL-2 production. These results indicate that co-cross-linking sIg with Fc gamma RII both prevented the opening of and actively closed the Ca2+ channel, and, through this mechanism, Fc gamma RII was able to control production of IL-2. Overall, since influx of extracellular Ca2+ has been found to be necessary for the proliferation and differentiation of B cells, Fc gamma RII may play a critical role in controlling these responses by regulating the opening of the Ca2+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W2034000906,"In the absence of DNA, purified yeast RNA polymerase II can bind RNA to form a binary complex. RNA in such RNA-RNA polymerase complexes undergoes reactions previously thought to be unique to nascent RNA in ternary complexes with DNA, including TFIIS-dependent cleavage and elongation by 3'-terminal addition of NMP from NTP. Both of these reactions are inhibited by alpha-amanitin. Hence, by several criteria the RNA in binary complexes is bound to the polymerase in a manner quite similar to that in ternary complexes in which the catalytic site for nucleotide addition is positioned at or near the 3'-OH terminus of the RNA. These findings are consistent with a model for the RNA polymerase ternary complex in which the RNA is bound at the 3' terminus through two protein-binding sites located up to 10 nt apart."
https://openalex.org/W1591497216,"To better understand the regulation of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) expression, we cloned the IGFBP-5 gene from human genomic libraries and identified a region in the 5' flanking sequence which functions as a promoter. The human IGFBP-5 gene is divided into four exons which, primarily due to a first intron of approximately 25 kilobases, span approximately 33 kilobases of DNA. Southern analysis identified a single copy of the IGFBP-5 gene in the haploid human genome, and several independent mapping strategies found this gene tightly linked with, and in opposite transcriptional orientation to, the IGFBP-2 gene at chromosomal region 2q33-34. Primer extension studies identified the IGFBP-5 mRNA cap site 772 base pairs (bp) 5' to the first nucleotide of the translation start codon. Analysis of the 5'-flanking sequence identified a potential TATA element beginning 33 bp 5' to the mRNA cap site. When a DNA fragment containing this cap site and 461 bp of upstream sequence was placed 5' to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and transfected into MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells, it directed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression in an orientation-specific manner, suggesting that this region contains elements essential for IGFBP-5 promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W1520633122,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a Cl- channel activated by protein kinase A and regulated by ATP in a complex manner. We have applied patch-clamp techniques to C127i mouse mammary carcinoma cells transfected with human CFTR to assess the role of external ATP in the modulation of CFTR function. Extracellular ATP was sufficient to activate non-rectifying, Cl(-)-selective whole-cell currents in CFTR-transfected, but not mock-transfected cells. The ATP-mediated activation of CFTR was independent of protein kinase A since channel activation by ATP was preserved in cells that were (a) depleted of intracellular ATP, (b) incubated with the cAMP antagonist Rp-cAMPS, or (c) exposed to the protein kinase A inhibitor, 5-24 amide. In each of these conditions, 8-Br-cAMP was no longer capable of activating CFTR. The possibility that the extracellular ATP activation of Cl- currents in CFTR-expressing C127i cells was mediated by a P2-type purinergic receptor was supported by studies in which the effect of external ATP on the Cl- currents was mimicked by the ATP analogs, ATP gamma S and beta,gamma-methylene ATP, but not the uridine nucleotide, UTP. Single-channel analysis of ATP-activated Cl -currents under both cell-attached and excised, inside-out patch-clamp configurations indicated that this channel is only present in CFTR-transfected cells and indistinguishable from CFTR. External ATP also activated ATP currents in CFTR-transfected cells, a novel function of CFTR. These findings are consistent with the presence of a purinergic receptor signal transduction mechanism in C127i cells whose activation by external ATP is linked to the activation of CFTR in a cAMP-independent manner. The data provide additional support for the use of ATP and its analogs as alternative therapies in cystic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1582765807,"A recent study of Fe(II).bleomycin-mediated DNA strand scission suggested that the metal binding domain of the drug is also the primary determinant of the observed sequence selectivity of strand scission (Carter, B. J., Murty, V. S., Reddy, K. S., Wang, S.-N., and Hecht, S. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4193-4196). Although it is well established that the bithiazole moiety+C-terminal substituent of bleomycin are required for DNA binding, the role of the bithiazole in sequence-selective DNA recognition remains unclear. To determine whether the bithiazole moiety exhibits an intrinsic DNA binding selectivity, three synthetic EDTA-conjugated bithiazole derivatives were used to mediate DNA cleavage in the presence of Fe2+ and dithiothreitol. Incubation of these Fe(II).EDTA-bithiazoles in the presence of a 5'-32P end-labeled DNA duplex resulted in strand scission at every position to essentially the same extent. The relative cleavage efficiencies among the bithiazoles were a strong function of their ionic state. These findings imply that the bithiazoles can bind to many sites on the DNA; they support a model of bleomycin-DNA interaction in which the bithiazole moiety+C-terminal substituent are required only for DNA binding, whereas the metal binding domain is responsible for metal ion coordination and oxygen activation as well as being the primary determinant of sequence-selective DNA cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1491682347,"In differentiated 3T3-F442A adipocytes, insulin stimulated rapid and transient phosphorylation of c-Jun. Insulin also stimulated phosphorylation of c-Fos and several Fos-related proteins (pp72, pp45, and pp39) as indicated by precipitation with anti-c-Fos antibody following exposure to denaturating conditions. Phosphorylation of c-Fos was stimulated by 7-fold by 60 min, while phosphorylation of Fos-related proteins reached maxima of 3.5-5.5-fold at 15 to 60 min. The increase in phosphorylated c-Fos was due to an increase in both c-Fos protein and the stoichiometry of c-Fos phosphorylation, and was not observed in c-fos (-/-) cells. Additionally, insulin stimulated phosphorylation of a protein with molecular mass of approximately 82 kDa on tyrosine residues by 2.5-fold within 30 min; this protein appeared to be immunologically related to c-Fos. These increases in the phosphorylation of AP-1 transcription factors correlated with a > 5-fold stimulation of expression of a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene transiently transfected into 3T3-F442A cells. These results indicate that insulin stimulates the phosphorylation of AP-1 transcription factors and several Fos-related proteins on serine and tyrosine residues. This is associated with changes in AP-1-mediated gene expression in vivo, suggesting that AP-1 phosphorylation by insulin plays a role in insulin-regulated gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1554049431,"Although constitutive expression of trophoblast or pregnancy-associated interferon (IFN) has long been recognized, their cDNA sequences have been determined for only ruminant ungulates. Here we show a human trophoblast IFN (htIFN) cDNA whose nucleotide sequence is very similar (85% identity) to that of ovine and bovine trophoblast IFNs, IFN tau s. Like ruminant IFN tau s, htIFN cDNAs contain an open reading frame of 195 codons including a signal sequence of 23 amino acids, resulting in a mature polypeptide of 172 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of htIFN shares 73, 62, and 56% identities with ovine IFN tau, human IFN alpha II, and human IFN alpha I, respectively. However, the expression of htIFN is not limited to a specific period of pregnancy because transcripts of htIFN genes are detected in human lymphocytes, cells obtained by amniocentesis (amniocytes), first trimester, and term placentas. Human trophoblast IFN mRNA is localized mainly in extravillous trophoblasts cells of placental villi, particularly in the migrating cytotrophoblasts cells, which eventually replace maternal endothelial cells in spiral arteries of the decidua. Both sense and antisense mRNAs for human IFN alpha II are localized in the outer layer of villous structures. Coexistence of these mRNAs at the placental villi throughout pregnancy suggests that, in addition to a role in placental cell growth and differentiation, IFNs may play a role protecting the fetus in viral environments."
https://openalex.org/W1533717041,"Primary cultures containing embryonic rat brain mesencephalic or hypothalamic dopamine neurons were used to examine the effects of membrane depolarization and elevations of cAMP levels on tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor content. Initial studies showed that 24-h incubations with 8-bromo-cAMP or isobutyl methylxanthine increased cofactor levels in either culture system, whereas the stimulatory effects of forskolin or depolarization of membrane potential were only observed in cultures of hypothalamus. 8-Bromo-cAMP was found to increase cofactor content in a concentration-dependent manner, with increases observed up to 5 mM. The time course of the effect of 8-bromo-cAMP was biphasic. Over the short term, an increase of 50% in cofactor content at 2 and 5 h was detected. Over the long term, by 24-48 h, cofactor levels increased by between 100% and 300%. Studies of cofactor turnover indicated that the long-term increase was due to stimulation of tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis with no alteration in degradation rate. Inhibitors of gene transcription and translation prevented the long- but not short-term increase in cofactor content. Levels of GTP cyclohydrolase I mRNA were increased 7-10-fold following 5 h of incubation with 8-bromo-cAMP. Tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis within cultured dopamine neurons of the hypothalamus and mesencephalon thus appears to be regulated by a cAMP-dependent mechanism involving enhanced gene expression of enzyme(s) involved in cofactor biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1657205520,"Permeabilized rabbit pancreatic acinar cells were used to study the effects of Ca2+ pump inhibition and Ca2+ store depletion on the sensitivity of internal Ca2+ stores to emptying by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3). Complete inhibition of pump activity by thapsigargin resulted in the monoexponential loss of 92% of the actively stored Ca2+ with a half-time of 6.2 min. Under these conditions, Ca2+ release evoked by a submaximal concentration of Ins-1,4,5-P3 did not cease after 1.5 min, as was observed in the absence of thapsigargin, but continued for at least 5 min. This observation suggests that under normal conditions of Ca2+ pumping, a substantial part of the internal Ca2+ stores is not depleted by the action of Ins-1,4,5-P3 due to compensatory Ca2+ uptake. Evidence in support of the idea of compensatory Ca2+ pumping was obtained in exchange experiments performed in the absence of thapsigargin. The slow kinetics of sustained Ca2+ release in the absence of Ca2+ pump activity suggests that Ca2+ is released from stores containing either relatively few or less sensitive Ins-1,4,5-P3-operated Ca2+ release channels. Gradual emptying of the internal Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin did not affect the potency with which Ins-1,4,5-P3 released Ca2+, indicating that the intravesicular Ca2+ content does not control the sensitivity of the Ins-1,4,5-P3-operated Ca2+ channel to activation by Ins-1,4,5-P3. This was confirmed using ruthenium red, which preferentially depleted the Ins-1,4,5-P3-releasable store without affecting the EC50 for Ins-1,4,5-P3-stimulated Ca2+ release. The data presented indicate that the quantal type of Ca2+ release observed with Ins-1,4,5-P3 requires compensatory Ca2+ pumping. Moreover, they support the idea that internal Ca2+ stores display differential sensitivities toward Ins-1,4,5-P3 rather than responding uniformly to this internal Ca(2+)-mobilizing messenger."
https://openalex.org/W1504061742,"Regulated endocytosis by growth factor receptors requires intact receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity. To determine whether a similar requirement exists for the asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) receptor which lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and participates in constitutive endocytosis, we examined the effect of three tyrosine kinase inhibitors, tyrphostin, genistein, and staurosporine, on receptor-mediated endocytosis in the human hepatoma line HepG2. These compounds inhibited early receptor internalization from the plasma membrane to internal protease-resistant sites in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect correlated with their inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of the ASGP receptor in vitro. Receptor trafficking subsequent to receptor internalization was unaffected. Endocytosis of another constitutively internalized protein, the transferrin receptor, was also inhibited by these compounds. In contrast, pinocytosis of the fluid-phase marker Lucifer yellow was not inhibited. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors also decreased the endocytic rate of transfected ASGP receptor H1 subunit in SK-Hep-1 cells. Therefore an intact ASGP receptor heterooligomeric complex is not required for this effect. Mutation of the single cytoplasmic tyrosine at position 5 of the H1 subunit to phenylalanine produced an ASGP receptor which was endocytosed regardless of treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We conclude that tyrosine kinase activity modulates the rate of receptor endocytosis at a point early in the internalization process."
https://openalex.org/W1563221371,"The expression and cellular targeting of murine acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was examined after transient transfection of a human 293 cell line with a cDNA encoding the hydrophilic T-subunit. Expression of the recombinant clone produced catalytically active AChE either bound to the cell membranes, in an intracellular pool, or secreted into the medium. About 22% of the cell-associated AChE was membrane-linked as dimers and tetramers, required Triton X-100 for extraction, and bound to Triton X-100 as assessed by sucrose gradients. Immunocytochemical staining of live and permeabilized cells showed reactive epitopes at the plasma membrane. Assays of cell surface AChE activity indicated about 18% of the cellular enzyme was oriented on the external surface of the plasma membrane. Isotopic labeling of cultures with precursors of fatty acylation showed incorporation of [3H]palmitate into the membrane-bound fraction of AChE only. The label was sensitive to cleavage by mild alkaline methanol treatment, and the cleaved lipid was identified as methyl palmitate by thin layer chromatography, indicating covalent linkage of the fatty acid through an ester or thioester residue. Thus the membrane-bound AChE is palmitoylated, suggesting that fatty acylation may serve as an alternative mechanism for anchoring the hydrophilic polypeptide subunit of AChE to the external face of the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2048712406,"Expression of myelin proteins has been shown to be altered in transgenic mice that express papovaviral large tumor (T) antigens. This paper analyzes the effect on P0 gene expression in secondary Schwann cells transfected with the SV40 T antigen gene and in Schwann cells immortalized by T antigen. In secondary Schwann cells, both T antigen and c-Jun are required for significant inhibition of the P0 promoter; expression of only one of the proteins is insufficient for repression of the P0 gene. T antigen, c-Jun (p39), and c-Jun-related protein (p47) form an immunoprecipitable complex in SV40 immortalized Schwann cell lines, and T antigen and c-Jun bind independently and as a complex to the P0 promoter. Our data suggest that the probable molecular mechanism underlying the hypomyelination observed in transgenic animals expressing T antigen may be due to the repression of the P0 gene by T antigen and c-Jun."
https://openalex.org/W1590047640,"The rne gene product was highly purified from Escherichia coli cells overproducing the protein by a procedure including immunoaffinity chromatography. Expression in vivo and in vitro of the cloned 6-kilobase pair DNA fragment containing the entire rne gene resulted in the synthesis of a protein migrating as a 180-kDa polypeptide in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The position of the protein on the two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel indicated that the protein is highly acidic. The enzymatic activity test which used as the substrate RNA I and 9 S RNA provided evidence that the rne gene is the structural gene for the RNA processing enzyme RNAse E. The Western blot analysis performed using a rabbit antiserum raised against a truncated 110-kDa protein fragment of RNase E (containing two-thirds of the sequence from the N terminus) revealed that the 180-kDa polypeptide is the only protein recognized by the antibodies in a wild type whole cell extract of E. coli. The antibodies cross-reacted with similar molecular weight proteins from a number of different bacteria, suggesting that the rne gene product is evolutionarily conserved in the bacterial world."
https://openalex.org/W348521906,"We have investigated the hypothesis that preferential translation of the heat stress mRNAs requires the binding of a trans-acting protein factor. 32P-Labeled RNA probes covering the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of HSP70 mRNA were synthesized, and gel retardation and UV cross-linking assays performed to identify trans-acting sequence-specific RNA-binding factors. The results indicate that no HSP70 5'-UTR RNA-specific binding proteins exist. Reducing the stringency in the gel retardation binding analyses revealed several non-sequence-specific RNA-binding complexes. The proteins bind RNA more strongly than DNA, show minor preferences for specific sequences, but none binds more strongly to the HSP70 5'-UTR than to other non-heat stress RNAs. Ultraviolet cross-linking analysis identifies two principal HSP70 5'-UTR binding proteins, of approximately 50 and 70 kDa. The p50 binding activity is increased severalfold for all mRNAs in heat-stressed lysates, and its binding produces the primary gel-retarded complex. Further detailed analyses were performed to probe for any possible heat-influenced changes. RNA/protein interactions are not affected by capping. Neither the kinetics nor the salt sensitivity of protein binding is affected by heat. Binding analyses using partial or complete HSP70 5'-UTR give qualitatively similar conclusions. Binding analyses were also carried out with several 5'-UTRs to investigate whether a heat-induced repressor might be activated by heating. No normal mRNA-specific heat-induced binding changes are detected. We conclude that heat-induced alterations in RNA-binding proteins do not mediate preferential translation of heat stress mRNAs or repression of normal mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1577149807,"Gramicidin A (gA) channels are dimers formed by right-handed beta 6.3-helical monomers. The stereochemical basis for the preference of a right-handed conformation remains obscure, but it has earlier been demonstrated that the handedness can be shifted by changing the chirality of each residue in the LD-sequence and therefore is determined by the peptide itself and not by channel-membrane interactions. We now examine the contributions of Trp15, the central Val residues 6-8, and residues 1-5. None of these alone are sufficient to specify the helix sense. To examine the D-Val6-L-Val7-D-Val8 sequence, the register of the 3 valines was shifted by one to L-Val5-D-Val6-L-Val7. The resulting analogue, [Val5,D-Ala8]gA, forms channels with a conductance and duration that are both somewhat less than those of gA channels. The reduced channel duration can be attributed to a steric conflict between the side chains of Val1 in one monomer and Val5 in the other monomer. The helix handedness is not altered by this modification, as shown by circular dichroism and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and by hybrid channel experiments. [Val5,D-Ala8]gA forms hybrid channels with gA (which forms right-handed channels), but not with des-Val1-gA- (which forms left-handed channels). Similar hybrid channel analysis shows that des-Trp15-gA and [L-Ala1,D-Ala2,L-Ala3,D-Ala4]gA also form right-handed channels. We conclude that the helix handedness most probably is a complex function of the arrangement of both the D-Val-L-Val-D-Val and the L-Trp-(D-Leu-L-Trp)3 segments."
https://openalex.org/W1522365897,"Abstract Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol serves as the major precursor for the biosynthesis of asparagine-linked glycoproteins in eukaryotes. The first 5 of the 9 mannosyl residues during the assembly of the oligosaccharide moiety within the dolichol cycle in the endoplasmic reticulum are incorporated directly by the action of GDP-Man-requiring mannosyltransferases while the remaining last 4 mannosyl residues are transferred by Man-P-Dol-requiring enzymes. In an earlier study (Shailubhai, K., Illeperuma, C., Tayal, M., and Vijay, I. K. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14105-14108), we identified the enzyme UDP-Glc:Dol-P glucosyltransferase by photolabeling rat mammary microsomes with 5-N3-[beta-32P]UDP-Glc. Applying a similar strategy, GDP-hexanolamine-125I-azidosalicylic acid, an analog of GDP-Man, was found to photolabel two polypeptides of 37 and 69 kDa among the microsomal proteins of the rat mammary gland. A differential ammonium sulfate saturation (60-80%) of the detergent-solubilized microsomal proteins enriched the 69-kDa polypeptide. Photolabeling of this polypeptide was specifically inhibited by guanine-containing nucleotides and nucleotide-sugars and was associated with a GDP-Man-requiring mannosyltransferase. The mannosyltransferase was purified nearly 16,000-fold and shown to contain the 69-kDa polypeptide. The purified enzyme catalyzes the transfer of [14C]Man from GDP-[14C]Man to Man beta 1-->4GlcNAc beta 1-->4GlcNAc-P-P-Dol in alpha 1,3-linkage to give [14C]Man alpha 1-->3Man beta 1-->4GlcNAc beta 1-->4GlcNAc-P-P-Dol as the product. Antibodies raised against the 69-kDa polypeptide removed the enzymatic activity from the detergent extract of the rat mammary microsomes and reacted specifically with a polypeptide band of the same size on immunoblots. The purified enzyme showed a pH optima of 7.4-7.8, Km approximately 4 microM for GDP-Man, approximately 2-fold activation by phosphatidylcholine, and a strong inhibition by sulfhydryl-selective reagents, N-ethylmaleimide and p-chloromercuribenzoate. The availability of the highly purified enzyme and a monospecific antibody should allow its molecular cloning for investigating the regulation of the machinery for protein N-glycosylation upon hormonally modulated growth and differentiation of the mammary gland during its ontogeny."

Using a rapid polymerase chain reaction assay, we now demonstrate that the genome of ZR-78.1 contains only the mutant allele. When mutant ZR-78.1 is fused with wild-type karyoplasts, occasional nuclear are observed that lack peroxisomes (Allen, L.-A. H., Morand, O. H., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 7012-7016). Despite the fact that negative nuclear hybrids are tetraploid, they do not contain the wild-type PAF-1 gene, suggesting that a chromosome fragment bearing the wild-type copy of PAF-1 was lost. Negative nuclear hybrids reconstituted with wild-type cytoplasts do contain a wild-type PAF-1 gene, indicating that the cytoplasts somehow reintroduced the wild-type PAF-1 allele without increasing ploidy. These findings support the role of PAF-1 and exclude the hypothesis of an additional cytoplasmic requirement for reinitiation of peroxisome biogenesis in peroxisome-deficient CHO cells. The plasmalogen deficiency and some other biochemical properties of ZR-78.1 are partially corrected in 5-azacytidine-treated subclones. However, such pseudo-revertants do not contain peroxisomes, consistent with the fact that there is no wild-type PAF-1 gene to reactivate by demethylation."
