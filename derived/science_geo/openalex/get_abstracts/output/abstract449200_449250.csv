https://openalex.org/W2084833108,"A mechanism to explain chromosomal instability (CIN) in colorectal cancer is demonstrated; three new CIN-suppressor genes (PIGN, MEX3C and ZNF516) encoded on chromosome 18q are identified, the loss of which leads to DNA replication stress, resulting in structural and numerical chromosome segregation errors, which are shown to be identical to phenotypes seen in CIN cells. Chromosomal instability (CIN) occurs in most solid tumours and is associated with poor prognosis and drug resistance. This study demonstrates a link between CIN in colorectal cancer and the loss of a region on chromosome 18q. The authors identify three previously unknown CIN-suppressor genes in this region that, when lost, lead to replication stress resulting in structural and numerical chromosome segregation errors. Supplementing tumour cell lines with nucleosides alleviates replication-associated damage, limits chromosome segregation errors after CIN-suppressor gene silencing and attenuates segregation errors and DNA damage in CIN+ cells. These findings point to a genetic mechanism — distinct from mitotic defects — that causes chromosome instability in colorectal tumours and that might be pharmacologically reversible. Cancer chromosomal instability (CIN) results in an increased rate of change of chromosome number and structure and generates intratumour heterogeneity1,2. CIN is observed in most solid tumours and is associated with both poor prognosis and drug resistance3,4. Understanding a mechanistic basis for CIN is therefore paramount. Here we find evidence for impaired replication fork progression and increased DNA replication stress in CIN+ colorectal cancer (CRC) cells relative to CIN− CRC cells, with structural chromosome abnormalities precipitating chromosome missegregation in mitosis. We identify three new CIN-suppressor genes (PIGN (also known as MCD4), MEX3C (RKHD2) and ZNF516 (KIAA0222)) encoded on chromosome 18q that are subject to frequent copy number loss in CIN+CRC. Chromosome 18q loss was temporally associated with aneuploidy onset at the adenoma–carcinoma transition. CIN-suppressor gene silencing leads to DNA replication stress, structural chromosome abnormalities and chromosome missegregation. Supplementing cells with nucleosides, to alleviate replication-associated damage5, reduces the frequency of chromosome segregation errors after CIN-suppressor gene silencing, and attenuates segregation errors and DNA damage in CIN+ cells. These data implicate a central role for replication stress in the generation of structural and numerical CIN, which may inform new therapeutic approaches to limit intratumour heterogeneity."

https://openalex.org/W1976907618,"CRISPR/Cas systems are bacterial adaptive immune systems that provide sequence-specific protection from invading nucleic acids, including from bacteriophages; in a notable reverse a vibriophage-encoded CRISPR/Cas system, used to disable a bacteriophage inhibitory chromosomal island in Vibrio cholerae, is identified. The CRISPR/Cas bacterial adaptive immune systems provide sequence-specific protection from invading nucleic acids, including those of bacteriophage. As such, they are key weapons in an ongoing co-evolutionary arms race. Here Andrew Camilli and colleagues reveal a remarkable case in which these weapons have been turned on their bacterial bearers. The authors identify a vibriophage-encoded CRISPR/Cas system that is used to disarm a bacteriophage inhibitory chromosomal island in the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Bacteriophages (or phages) are the most abundant biological entities on earth, and are estimated to outnumber their bacterial prey by tenfold1. The constant threat of phage predation has led to the evolution of a broad range of bacterial immunity mechanisms that in turn result in the evolution of diverse phage immune evasion strategies, leading to a dynamic co-evolutionary arms race2,3. Although bacterial innate immune mechanisms against phage abound, the only documented bacterial adaptive immune system is the CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated proteins) system, which provides sequence-specific protection from invading nucleic acids, including phage4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Here we show a remarkable turn of events, in which a phage-encoded CRISPR/Cas system is used to counteract a phage inhibitory chromosomal island of the bacterial host. A successful lytic infection by the phage is dependent on sequence identity between CRISPR spacers and the target chromosomal island. In the absence of such targeting, the phage-encoded CRISPR/Cas system can acquire new spacers to evolve rapidly and ensure effective targeting of the chromosomal island to restore phage replication."
https://openalex.org/W2131990963,"Broad X-ray emission lines from neutral and partially ionized iron observed in active galaxies have been interpreted as fluorescence produced by the reflection of hard X-rays off the inner edge of an accretion disk. In this model, line broadening and distortion result from rapid rotation and relativistic effects near the black hole, the line shape being sensitive to its spin. Alternative models in which the distortions result from absorption by intervening structures provide an equally good description of the data, and there has been no general agreement on which is correct. Recent claims that the black hole (2E6 solar masses) at the centre of the galaxy NGC 1365 is rotating at close to its maximum possible speed rest on the assumption of relativistic reflection. Here we report X-ray observations of NGC 1365 that reveal the relativistic disk features through broadened Fe line emission and an associated Compton scattering excess of 10-30 keV. Using temporal and spectral analyses, we disentangle continuum changes due to time-variable absorption from reflection, which we find arises from a region within 2.5 gravitational radii of the rapidly spinning black hole. Absorption-dominated models that do not include relativistic disk reflection can be ruled out both statistically and on physical grounds."
https://openalex.org/W1984583080,"Eukaryotic transcription initiation requires the assembly of general transcription factors into a pre-initiation complex that ensures the accurate loading of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at the transcription start site. The molecular mechanism and function of this assembly have remained elusive due to lack of structural information. Here we have used an in vitro reconstituted system to study the stepwise assembly of human TBP, TFIIA, TFIIB, Pol II, TFIIF, TFIIE and TFIIH onto promoter DNA using cryo-electron microscopy. Our structural analyses provide pseudo-atomic models at various stages of transcription initiation that illuminate critical molecular interactions, including how TFIIF engages Pol II and promoter DNA to stabilize both the closed pre-initiation complex and the open-promoter complex, and to regulate start--initiation complexes, combined with the localization of the TFIIH helicases XPD and XPB, support a DNA translocation model of XPB and explain its essential role in promoter opening."
https://openalex.org/W2121998739,"Growth of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) requires high levels of hedgehog (HH) signalling through the transcription factor GLI. Although inhibitors of membrane protein smoothened (SMO) effectively suppress HH signalling, early tumour resistance illustrates the need for additional downstream targets for therapy. Here we identify atypical protein kinase C ι/λ (aPKC-ι/λ) as a novel GLI regulator in mammals. aPKC-ι/λ and its polarity signalling partners co-localize at the centrosome and form a complex with missing-in-metastasis (MIM), a scaffolding protein that potentiates HH signalling. Genetic or pharmacological loss of aPKC-ι/λ function blocks HH signalling and proliferation of BCC cells. Prkci is a HH target gene that forms a positive feedback loop with GLI and exists at increased levels in BCCs. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling shows that aPKC-ι/λ and SMO control the expression of similar genes in tumour cells. aPKC-ι/λ functions downstream of SMO to phosphorylate and activate GLI1, resulting in maximal DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Activated aPKC-ι/λ is upregulated in SMO-inhibitor-resistant tumours and targeting aPKC-ι/λ suppresses signalling and growth of resistant BCC cell lines. These results demonstrate that aPKC-ι/λ is critical for HH-dependent processes and implicates aPKC-ι/λ as a new, tumour-selective therapeutic target for the treatment of SMO-inhibitor-resistant cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2087252982,"A mathematical method, known as ergodic rate analysis, has been developed and used to study the rates of molecular events from single time measurements of large populations of fixed cells; this new method is able to overcome some of the previous limitations with regards to studying cell-size control. How cell size is maintained is a fundamental question in cell biology. In this study, Marc Kirschner and colleagues describe a new analytical method, called ergodic rate analysis (ERA), which measures the dynamics of cellular processes based on single-cell measurements in fixed steady-state populations. They use the method to monitor how proliferating cells constrain variation in cell size, and to calculate the rate of cell growth in relation to their position in the cell cycle. The results suggest that just before S phase, there is a sharp transition in the dependence of growth rate on cell size that acts to limit variation. Biologists have long been concerned about what constrains variation in cell size, but progress in this field has been slow and stymied by experimental limitations1. Here we describe a new method, ergodic rate analysis (ERA), that uses single-cell measurements of fixed steady-state populations to accurately infer the rates of molecular events, including rates of cell growth. ERA exploits the fact that the number of cells in a particular state is related to the average transit time through that state2. With this method, it is possible to calculate full time trajectories of any feature that can be labelled in fixed cells, for example levels of phosphoproteins or total cellular mass. Using ERA we find evidence for a size-discriminatory process at the G1/S transition that acts to decrease cell-to-cell size variation."
https://openalex.org/W2078790442,"Quantitative biomechanical models can identify control parameters that are used during movements, and movement parameters that are encoded by premotor neurons. We fit a mathematical dynamical systems model including subsyringeal pressure, syringeal biomechanics and upper-vocal-tract filtering to the songs of zebra finches. This reduces the dimensionality of singing dynamics, described as trajectories (motor 'gestures') in a space of syringeal pressure and tension. Here we assess model performance by characterizing the auditory response 'replay' of song premotor HVC neurons to the presentation of song variants in sleeping birds, and by examining HVC activity in singing birds. HVC projection neurons were excited and interneurons were suppressed within a few milliseconds of the extreme time points of the gesture trajectories. Thus, the HVC precisely encodes vocal motor output through activity at the times of extreme points of movement trajectories. We propose that the sequential activity of HVC neurons is used as a 'forward' model, representing the sequence of gestures in song to make predictions on expected behaviour and evaluate feedback."

Understanding the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms by which TGF-β induces EMT may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for metastasis. Here, we report that TGF-β induced SNAI2 to promote EMT by repressing miR-203. Although miR-203 targeted SNAI2, SNAI2 induced by TGF-β could directly bind to the miR-203 promoter to inhibit its transcription. SNAI2 and miR-203 formed a double negative feedback loop to inhibit each other's expression, thereby controlling EMT. Moreover, we found that miR-203 was significantly down-regulated in highly metastatic breast cancer cells. The restoration of miR-203 in highly metastatic breast cancer cells inhibited tumor cell invasion in vitro and lung metastatic colonization in vivo by repressing SNAI2. Taken together, our results suggest that the SNAI2 and miR-203 regulatory loop plays important roles in EMT and tumor metastasis.

https://openalex.org/W2054710865,"Alzheimer disease and several other neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the accumulation of intraneuronal fibrils comprised of the protein Tau. Tau is normally a soluble protein that stabilizes microtubules, with splice isoforms that contain either three (3-R) or four (4-R) microtubule binding repeats. The formation of Tau fibrils is thought to result in neuronal damage, and inhibitors of Tau fibrillization may hold promise as therapeutic agents. The process of Tau fibrillization can be replicated in vitro, and a number of small molecules have been identified that inhibit Tau fibril formation. However, little is known about how these molecules affect Tau fibrillization. Here, we examined the mechanism by which the previously described aminothieno pyridazine (ATPZ) series of compounds inhibit Tau fibrillization. Active ATPZs were found to promote the oxidation of the two cysteine residues within 4-R Tau by a redox cycling mechanism, resulting in the formation of a disulfide-containing compact monomer that was refractory to fibrillization. Moreover, the ATPZs facilitated intermolecular disulfide formation between 3-R Tau monomers, leading to dimers that were capable of fibrillization. The ATPZs also caused cysteine oxidation in molecules unrelated to Tau. Interestingly, methylene blue, an inhibitor of Tau fibrillization under evaluation in Alzheimer disease clinical trials, caused a similar oxidation of cysteines in Tau and other molecules. These findings reveal that the ATPZs and methylene blue act by a mechanism that may affect their viability as potential therapeutic agents."

https://openalex.org/W2041441588,"Some extracellular proteins are initially secreted in reduced forms via a non-canonical pathway bypassing the endoplasmic reticulum and become oxidized in the extracellular space. One such protein is HMGB1 (high-mobility group box 1). Extracellular HMGB1 has different redox states that play distinct roles in inflammation. Using a unique NMR-based approach, we have investigated the kinetics of HMGB1 oxidation and the half-lives of all-thiol and disulfide HMGB1 species in serum, saliva, and cell culture medium. In this approach, salt-free lyophilized (15)N-labeled all-thiol HMGB1 was dissolved in actual extracellular fluids, and the oxidation and clearance kinetics were monitored in situ by recording a series of heteronuclear (1)H-(15)N correlation spectra. We found that the half-life depends significantly on the extracellular environment. For example, the half-life of all-thiol HMGB1 ranged from ~17 min (in human serum and saliva) to 3 h (in prostate cancer cell culture medium). Furthermore, the binding of ligands (glycyrrhizin and heparin) to HMGB1 significantly modulated the oxidation kinetics. Thus, the balance between the roles of all-thiol and disulfide HMGB1 proteins depends significantly on the extracellular environment and can also be artificially modulated by ligands. This is important because extracellular HMGB1 has been suggested as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases and cancer. Our work demonstrates that the in situ protein NMR approach is powerful for investigating the behavior of proteins in actual extracellular fluids containing an enormous number of different molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2050265035,"The transition from unicellular to multicellular life, which occurred several times during evolution, requires tight interaction and communication of neighboring cells. The multicellular cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 forms filaments of hundreds of interacting cells exchanging metabolites and signal molecules and is able to differentiate specialized cells in response to environmental stimuli. Mutation of cell wall amidase AmiC2 leads to a severe phenotype with formation of aberrant septa in the distorted filaments, which completely lack cell communication and potential for cell differentiation. Here we demonstrate the function of the amidase AmiC2 in formation of cell-joining structures. The AmiC2 protein localizes to the young septum between cells and shows bona fide amidase activity in vivo and in vitro. Vancomycin staining identified the overall septum morphology in living cells. By electron microscopy of isolated peptidoglycan sacculi, the submicroscopic structure of the cell junctions could be visualized, revealing a novel function for a cell wall amidase: AmiC2 drills holes into the cross-walls, forming an array of ~155 nanopores with a diameter of ~20 nm each. These nanopores seem to constitute a framework for cell-joining proteins, penetrating the cell wall. The entire array of junctional nanopores appears as a novel bacterial organelle, establishing multicellularity in a filamentous prokaryote.—Lehner, J., Berendt, S., Dörsam, B., Pérez, R., Forchhammer, K., Maldener, I.

https://openalex.org/W1967822167,"The type II transmembrane serine protease matriptase is a key regulator of epithelial barriers in skin and intestine. In skin, matriptase acts upstream of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored serine protease, prostasin, to activate the prostasin zymogen and initiate a proteolytic cascade that is required for stratum corneum barrier functionality. Here, we have investigated the relationship between prostasin and matriptase in intestinal epithelial barrier function. We find that similar to skin, matriptase and prostasin are components of a common intestinal epithelial barrier-forming pathway. Depletion of prostasin by siRNA silencing in Caco-2 intestinal epithelium inhibits barrier development similar to loss of matriptase, and the addition of recombinant prostasin to the basal side of polarized Caco-2 epithelium stimulates barrier forming changes similar to the addition of recombinant matriptase. However, in contrast to the proteolytic cascade in skin, prostasin functions upstream of matriptase to activate the endogenous matriptase zymogen. Prostasin is unable to proteolytically activate the matriptase zymogen directly but induces matriptase activation indirectly. Prostasin requires expression of endogenous matriptase to stimulate barrier formation since matriptase depletion by siRNA silencing abrogates prostasin barrier-forming activity. Active recombinant matriptase, however, does not require the expression of endogenous prostasin for barrier-forming activity. Together, these data show that matriptase and not prostasin is the primary effector protease of tight junction assembly in simple columnar epithelia and further highlight a spatial and tissue-specific aspect of cell surface proteolytic cascades."
https://openalex.org/W2061489261,"The product of the mouse Imprinted and Ancient gene, IMPACT, is preferentially expressed in neurons. We have previously shown that IMPACT overexpression inhibits the activation of the protein kinase GCN2, which signals amino acid starvation. GCN2 phosphorylates the α-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), resulting in inhibition of general protein synthesis but increased translation of specific messages, such as ATF4. GCN2 is also involved in the regulation of neuronal functions, controlling synaptic plasticity, memory, and feeding behavior. We show here that IMPACT abundance increases during differentiation of neurons and neuron-like N2a cells, whereas GCN2 displays lowered activation levels. Upon differentiation, IMPACT associates with translating ribosomes, enhances translation initiation, and down-regulates the expression of ATF4. We further show that endogenous IMPACT promotes neurite outgrowth whereas GCN2 is a strong inhibitor of spontaneous neuritogenesis. Together, these results uncover the participation of the GCN2-IMPACT module of translational regulation in a highly controlled step in the development of the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2002786282,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinflammatory molecule in mammals that, unusually for a cytokine, exhibits tautomerase and oxidoreductase enzymatic activities. Homologues of this well conserved protein are found within diverse phyla including a number of parasitic organisms. Herein, we produced recombinant histidine-tagged Toxoplasma gondii MIF (TgMIF), a 12-kDa protein that lacks oxidoreductase activity but exhibits tautomerase activity with a specific activity of 19.3 μmol/min/mg that cannot be inhibited by the human MIF inhibitor ISO-1. The crystal structure of the TgMIF homotrimer has been determined to 1.82 Å, and although it has close structural homology with mammalian MIFs, it has critical differences in the tautomerase active site that account for the different inhibitor sensitivity. We also demonstrate that TgMIF can elicit IL-8 production from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells while also activating ERK MAPK pathways in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. TgMIF may therefore play an immunomodulatory role during T. gondii infection in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1964622466,"Despite the recent first structural insight into the insulin-insulin receptor complex, the role of the C terminus of the B-chain of insulin in this assembly remains unresolved. Previous studies have suggested that this part of insulin must rearrange to reveal amino acids crucial for interaction with the receptor. The role of the invariant Phe(B24), one of the key residues of the hormone, in this process remains unclear. For example, the B24 site functionally tolerates substitutions to D-amino acids but not to L-amino acids. Here, we prepared and characterized a series of B24-modified insulin analogues, also determining the structures of [D-HisB24]-insulin and [HisB24]-insulin. The inactive [HisB24]-insulin molecule is remarkably rigid due to a tight accommodation of the L-His side chain in the B24 binding pocket that results in the stronger tethering of B25-B28 residues to the protein core. In contrast, the highly active [D-HisB24]-insulin is more flexible, and the reverse chirality of the B24C(α) atom swayed the D-His(B24) side chain into the solvent. Furthermore, the pocket vacated by Phe(B24) is filled by Phe(B25), which mimics the Phe(B24) side and main chains. The B25→B24 downshift results in a subsequent downshift of Tyr(B26) into the B25 site and the departure of B26-B30 residues away from the insulin core. Our data indicate the importance of the aromatic L-amino acid at the B24 site and the structural invariance/integrity of this position for an effective binding of insulin to its receptor. Moreover, they also suggest limited, B25-B30 only, unfolding of the C terminus of the B-chain upon insulin activation."

Matriptase overexpression has been implicated in tumor progression in certain epithelium-derived cancer cells. Matriptase is tightly regulated by its cognate inhibitor hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 (HAI-1). It has been demonstrated that the Kunitz domain I (KD1) but not Kunitz domain II (KD2) of HAI-1 is responsible for the inhibitory activity of HAI-1 against matriptase. To investigate the molecular basis of inhibition of matriptase by HAI-1, we solved several crystal structures of matriptase serine protease domain in complex with the fragments of HAI-1. Based on these structures, we found that the binding of KD1 was different from previously predicted binding mode. The P3 arginine residue occupies the S3 specificity pocket of matriptase, but not the S4 pocket as in the cases of hepatocyte growth factor activator·HAI-1 KD1 and matriptase·sunflower trypsin inhibitor-1 complexes. The long 60-loop of matriptase makes direct contact with HAI-1 but remains flexible even in the complexes, and its apex does not bind with KD1 tightly. The interactions between this unique 60-loop and KD1 may provide an opportunity to increase the specificity and inhibitory activity of KD1 for matriptase.

Matriptase consists of an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a signal anchor trans-membrane domain that tethers it to the cell surface, followed by a sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase, agrin domain, two complement C1r/C1s, urchin embryonic growth factor, bone morphogenic protein 1 domains, four tandem low-density lipoprotein receptor class A (LDLRA) domains and a C-terminal serine protease domain. Similar to most serine proteases, matriptase is expressed as an inactive zymogen that requires endoproteolytic cleavage for activation. However, matriptase does not depend on other active protease for activation but instead undergoes autoactivation, endowing matriptase the potential as an initiator for downstream signaling cascade (20Oberst M.D. Williams C.A.

Detailed mechanism of the autoactivation of matriptase remains unresolved but is believed to be dependent on its own catalytic triad as well as interactions between its non-catalytic domains and HAI-1. HAI-1 is a trans-membrane epithelial-derived Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor originally identified as a potent inhibitor of hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFA) (24Shimomura T. Denda K.

HAI-1 comprises 513 amino acids and consists of an N-terminal domain, an internal domain, a LDLRA domain that is inserted between two Kunitz domains, and a C-terminal trans-membrane domain. The extracellular domain can be cleaved at several sites and released as soluble ectodomains by at least two proteases (27Shimomura T. Denda K. Kawaguchi T. Matsumoto K. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N.

The 58-kDa species contains the entire extracellular domain after shedding, whereas the 40-kDa species lacks the LDLRA and Kunitz II domains.

Enzymatic studies on the soluble fragments of HAI-1 suggest that HAI-1 domains interplay in the regulation of the inhibitory effect of Kunitz domain I (KD1) toward different proteases, including HGFA and matriptase (31Denda K.

Truncation of the N-terminal domain in addition to the KD2 of HAI-1 (IK1L) further lowers the Ki to 1.6 pm, suggesting that these two domains, instead of facilitating the inhibition of matriptase by HAI-1, might obstruct the interaction between HAI-1 and matriptase. This is in agreement to the in vivo finding that only the shorter 40- and 25-kDa species of HAI-1 but not the full-length HAI-1 are found to associate with matriptase in human milk (29Lin C.Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Dickson R.B. Purification and characterization of a complex containing matriptase and a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor from human milk.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18237-18242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, the exact physiological roles of the different molecular size HAI-1 remain largely unclear. Several structures of the catalytic domain of matriptase in complex of different inhibitors, including the prototypic Kunitz-type inhibitor bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), have been solved (34Friedrich R. Fuentes-Prior P. Ong E. Coombs G. Hunter M. Oehler R. Pierson D. Gonzalez R. Huber R. Bode W. Madison E.L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2160-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The structure of HAI-1 KD1 in complex with another protease target HGFA has also been reported (32Shia S. Stamos J. Kirchhofer D. Fan B. Wu J. Corpuz R.T. Santell L. Lazarus R.A. Eigenbrot C. Conformational lability in serine protease active sites: structures of hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFA) alone and with the inhibitory domain from HGFA inhibitor-1B.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1335-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, structural and mechanistic details on the inhibition of matriptase by KD1 but not KD2 of HAI-1, and the role of the long 60-loop in matriptase substrate specificity remain largely unknown. Here, we generated recombinant proteins of the human matriptase serine protease domain with a mutation N164Q in its active (β-matriptase-N164Q) and inactive (β-matriptase-N164Q/S195A) forms, and the KD2-truncated HAI-1 (HAI-1-NIK1L) independently. However, when we formed complexes of HAI-1-NIK1L and β-matriptase, HAI-1-NIK1L underwent degradation into KD1 only as revealed by our LC-MS/MS results. Eventually, we obtained the crystal structures of the inactive β-matriptase-N164Q/S195A in a ligand-free form and in complex with HAI-1 KD1, as well as two different forms of β-matriptase-N164Q·KD1 complex at 1.48, 2.29, 2.45, and 2.01 Å, respectively. These crystal structures provide insights into the inhibition mechanism of matriptase by HAI-1 KD1, which was different from previously predicted mechanism. Furthermore, homology modeling of HAI-1 KD2 based on KD1 structure elucidates the structural basis of selective inhibition of matriptase by KD1 but not KD2. The serine protease domain of matriptase, β-matriptase (Swiss-Prot accession no. Q9Y5Y6, residues 615–855, corresponds 16–244 in chymotrypsin numbering, which will be used throughout this work) with a N164Q mutation to eliminate potential glycosylation was expressed in X-33 Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris, Komagataella) cells and purified as described previously (35Yuan C.

Biol. 2011; 11: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The active site-mutated β-matriptase-N164Q (β-matriptase-N164Q/S195A) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the plasmid of pPICZαA containing the β-matriptase-N164Q gene. Then, it was expressed in X-33 Pichia pastoris according to the β-matriptase-N164Q expression procedure (35Yuan C. Chen L. Meehan E.J. Daly N. Craik D.J. Huang M. Ngo J.C.

The culture supernatant was concentrated to 50 ml using a Millipore concentrator (8000 Da Molecular Weight Cut-Off membrane) and then diluted to 500 ml with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The diluted medium was applied onto a Q Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m). Fractions containing β-matriptase-N164Q/S195A based on SDS-PAGE analysis were concentrated and further purified by a gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 75 HR 10/30, Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl. Fractions containing β-matriptase-N164Q/S195A were collected and concentrated. To express soluble human HAI-1-NIK1L protein (Swiss-Prot accession no. O43278-2, residues Gly36(H) to Ser386(H), the amino acid numbering of HAI-1 starts from the putative N terminus of the protein), the cDNA was generated by PCR using the full-length cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Chen-Yong Lin). The fragments were digested with MluI and cloned into the expression vector pMT/Bip/V5-His-A (Invitrogen), which was digested with SmaI and MluI to yield expression vector pMT/Bip/HAI-1-NIK1L-His. The final expression vector sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. 2 μg of expression vector of pMT/Bip/HAI-1-NIK1L-His and selection vector pCoBlast (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 19:1 were co-transfected into Drosophila S2 cells using Cellfectin® II Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Selection for stable cell lines was performed by the addition of 25 μg/ml of blasticidin S-HCl (Invitrogen). The selected stable cells with HAI-1-NIK1L construct were grown in EX-CELL 420 serum-free medium (Sigma-Aldrich), and the target protein expression was induced by adding 500 μm CuSO4 to secrete HAI-1-NIK1L into the cultured medium. The conditioned medium was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated with equilibrium buffer (150 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). After washing, the target protein was eluted with 300 mm imidazole in the equilibrium buffer. The eluent was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 overnight and applied to an anion exchange column (MonoQ, Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The fractions containing the target protein were concentrated and applied to a gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 75 HR 10/30, Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the equilibrium buffer. Fractions containing the target protein were collected and concentrated. The ligand-free β-matriptase-N164Q/S195A was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and crystallized by using sitting drop vapor diffusion at room temperature. Tabular crystals were obtained with a precipitant solution of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1.7 m ammonium sulfate. For x-ray data collection, crystals were dipped into a precipitant solution of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2.2 m ammonium sulfate containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and then quickly immersed in liquid nitrogen. The complexes were formed by mixing matriptase and HAI-1 at a molar ratio of 1.5:1 and purifying by a gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 75 HR 10/30, Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. The complexes were concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and subjected to crystallization trials using the method of sitting drop vapor diffusion at room temperature. Diamond shape protein crystals were obtained with a precipitant solution of 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 in 0.1 m Tris-HCl at pH 8.5. For x-ray data collection, crystals were dipped into a cryoprotectant solution containing 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then quickly immersed in liquid nitrogen.

https://openalex.org/W2047419099,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a highly specialized process of protein-siRNA interaction that results in the regulation of gene expression and cleavage of target mRNA. The PAZ domain of the Argonaute proteins binds to the 3' end of siRNA, and during RNAi the attaching end of the siRNA switches between binding and release from its binding pocket. This biphasic interaction of the 3' end of siRNA with the PAZ domain is essential for RNAi activity; however, it remains unclear whether stronger or weaker binding with PAZ domain will facilitate or hinder the overall RNAi process. Here we report the correlation between the binding of modified siRNA 3' overhang analogues and their in vivo RNAi efficacy. We found that higher RNAi efficacy was associated with the parameters of lower Ki value, lower total intermolecular energy, lower free energy, higher hydrogen bonding, smaller total surface of interaction and fewer van der Waals interactions. Electrostatic interaction was a minor contributor to compounds recognition, underscoring the presence of phosphate groups in the modified analogues. Thus, compounds with lower binding affinity are associated with better gene silencing. Lower binding strength along with the smaller interaction surface, higher hydrogen bonding and fewer van der Waals interactions were among the markers for favorable RNAi activity. Within the measured parameters, the interaction surface, van der Waals interactions and inhibition constant showed a statistically significant correlation with measured RNAi efficacy. The considerations provided in this report will be helpful in the design of new compounds with better gene silencing ability."

It also triggers oncogene-induced senescence to block Ras mutation. Loss of the Rb1 pathway, which is a hallmark of cancer cells, then provides a permissive environment for Ras mutation, and Ras is sufficient for invasive tumor formation in Rb1 family mutant mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). These results demonstrate that sequential mutation of the Rb1 and Ras pathways comprises a tumor initiation axis. Both Rb1 and Ras regulate expression of the transcription factor ZEB1, thereby linking tumor initiation to the subsequent invasion and metastasis, which is induced by ZEB1. ZEB1 acts in a negative feedback loop to block expression of miR-200, which is thought to facilitate tumor invasion and metastasis. However, ZEB1 also represses cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors to control the cell cycle; its mutation in MEFs leads to induction of these inhibitors and premature senescence. Here, we provide evidence for two sequential inductions of ZEB1 during Ras transformation of MEFs. Rb1 constitutively represses cdk inhibitors, and induction of ZEB1 when the Rb1 pathway is lost is required to maintain this repression, allowing for the classic immortalization and loss of cell contact inhibition seen when the Rb1 pathway is lost. In vivo, we show that this induction of ZEB1 is required for Ras-initiated tumor formation. ZEB1 is then further induced by Ras, beyond the level seen with Rb1 mutation, and this Ras superinduction is required to reach a threshold of ZEB1 sufficient for repression of miR-200 and tumor invasion.

Indeed, in Ras-initiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ZEB1 is induced, and invasive and metastatic cells are evident remarkably early, even before a frank tumor can be identified (17Rhim A.D.

Although expression of ZEB1 and invasion/metastasis are generally associated with later stage tumors, these results suggest that Ras may accelerate the appearance of ZEB1 and resulting invasion/metastasis in tumors where it is mutated. ZEB1 acts in a negative feedback loop to repress expression of the miR-200 family, which has a key role in tumor invasion and metastasis (14Brabletz S. Brabletz T.

A reciprocal repression between ZEB1 and members of the miR-200 family promotes EMT and invasion in cancer cells.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 582-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar); however, ZEB1 is also required to maintain repression of cell cycle inhibitory cdk inhibitors, and its down-regulation in ZEB1+/− and ZEB1−/− MEFs leads to a ZEB1 concentration-dependent induction of these cdk inhibitors and premature senescence (11Liu Y. El-Naggar S. Darling D.S. Higashi Y. Dean D.C.

Ras also drives sarcoma formation, and ZEB1 expression is linked to invasion and metastasis in these tumors, where epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition would not appear to be a factor. Taken together, these findings raise the possibility that ZEB1 may have roles in tumor progression extending beyond the ZEB1/miR-200 loop thought to facilitate invasion and metastasis (21Yoo J.

Here, we examined the role for ZEB1 in a tumor model where sequential mutations of the Rb1 family and Ras in primary cultures of MEFs lead to generation of invasive sarcoma in nude mice. We demonstrate two sequential inductions of ZEB1 in this model, resulting first from mutation of Rb1 and then from Ras mutation. The Rb1 pathway constitutively represses cdk inhibitors, and we show that induction of ZEB1 when this pathway is lost is required to maintain repression of these inhibitors, allowing for the classic immortalization and loss of cell contact inhibition seen with Rb1 pathway mutation in cultured MEFs. Importantly, we demonstrate that the block in senescence resulting from this induction of ZEB1 is required subsequently for Ras-initiated tumor formation in nude mice. Then, when Ras is mutated, ZEB1 is further induced, and this induction by Ras is required to reach a threshold of ZEB1 sufficient to cause repression of miR-200, which we link to Ras-mediated tumor invasion. Rb1 family mutant MEFs and control wild-type MEFs were from T. Jacks. Cells derived from four separate embryos were used with similar results. The cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (26Liu Y. Clem B. Zuba-Surma E.K. El-Naggar S. Telang S. Jenson A.B. Wang Y. Shao H. Ratajczak M.Z. Chesney J. Dean D.C.

Briefly, polyadenylation of at least 5 μg of the total RNA was completed by a poly(A) polymerase kit (PAP; Ambion) in a 20-μl reaction volume according to the manufacturer's instructions. The polyadenylated RNA was thereafter utilized directly for cDNA preparation using a reverse transcription kit (M-MLV reverse transcriptase; Invitrogen) and an adaptor primer (5′-GCGAGCACAGAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGG(T)12VN*-3′) in a 40-μl reaction volume. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using a universal primer (5′-GCGAGCACAGAATTAATACGAC-3′) and a miRNA-specific primer (supplemental Table 2). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (11Liu Y. El-Naggar S. Darling D.S. Higashi Y. Dean D.C.

An additional five lentivirus shRNA knockdown vectors obtained from Open Biosystems were also used for knockdown of ZEB1 with equivalent results. Lentivirus with scrambled shRNA sequences was used as a control in the experiments (26Liu Y. Clem B. Zuba-Surma E.K. El-Naggar S. Telang S. Jenson A.B. Wang Y. Shao H. Ratajczak M.Z. Chesney J.

Rb1-E2F binds and represses the ZEB1 promoter, thus ZEB1 is induced in Rb1−/− MEFs, and it is further induced when all three Rb1 family members are mutated to generate TKO MEFs (Fig. 1A) (5Dannenberg J.H. van Rossum A. Schuijff L. te Riele H.

J. 2007; 408: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). ZEB1 expression remained induced as TKO MEFs were passaged in culture (supplemental Fig. 1). TKO MEFs are immortal in culture, and they display loss of cell contact inhibition and consequently continue to proliferate after they reach confluence (5Dannenberg J.H. van Rossum A. Schuijff L. te Riele H. Ablation of the retinoblastoma gene family deregulates G1 control causing immortalization and increased cell turnover under growth-restricting conditions.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 6Sage J.

To assess the functional significance of ZEB1 induction in TKO MEFs, we knocked its expression down using lentiviral shRNA. Five TKO ZEB1 shRNA clones expressing varying levels of ZEB1 mRNA were selected (Fig. 2A). The level of ZEB1 in wild-type and ZEB1+/− MEFs is shown for comparison. The most severe knockdown of ZEB1 mRNA (clone 2, Fig. 2A) had little effect initially on proliferation of the cells (Fig. 3A); however, with passage, proliferation diminished, and each of the clones became senescent in a ZEB1 mRNA level-dependent fashion (Fig. 3, B–D). It is of note that with TKO ZEB1 shRNA clone 1, where ZEB1 mRNA is knocked down by only ∼50%, the percentage of senescent cells at passage 6 is similar to that seen in wild-type MEFs at this same passage (Fig. 3B). We then concluded that induction of ZEB1 is required for immortalization of TKO MEFs.FIGURE 3Knockdown of ZEB1 in TKO MEFs does not affect initial proliferation, but it leads to epithelial morphology and induction of E-cadherin, and it restores passage-dependent senescence and cell contact inhibition.

El-Naggar S. Darling D.S. Higashi Y. Dean D.C. ZEB1 links epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cellular senescence.Development. 2008; 135: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Moreover, E-cadherin became ectopically expression in ZEB1 mutant mice (11Liu Y. El-Naggar S. Darling D.S. Higashi Y. Dean D.C. ZEB1 links epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cellular senescence.Development. 2008; 135: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). As in wild-type MEFs, knockdown of ZEB1 in TKO MEFs led to epithelial morphology and induction of E-cadherin (Fig. 3, E–G). No E-cadherin was evident in the parent TKOs (Fig. 3, H and I). Interestingly, knocking down ZEB1 in TKO MEFs to a level similar to that in wild-type MEFs (clone 5, Fig. 2) was sufficient to restore cell contact inhibition: TKO ZEB1 shRNA clone 5 at passage 1 was allowed to remain at confluence for 3 weeks, and no foci formation was evident (Fig. 3, E and F). We concluded that induction of ZEB1 in TKO MEFs is required for the loss of contact inhibition classically seen when the Rb1 pathway is mutated in MEFs. Cell contact inhibition causes accumulation of cdk inhibitors such as p16 that block activity of cdk4/6, which hyperphosphorylates and inactivates Rb1. When cdk4/6 is inhibited, active hypophosphorylated Rb1 accumulates, leading to cell cycle arrest and eventually senescence (7Zhang H.S. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C.

Senescence of wild-type MEFs with passage in culture is also the result of induction of cdk inhibitors. Chronic stimulation of the Ras pathway by serum growth factors in the culture media leads to activation of p53 and accumulation of cdk inhibitors that block activity cdk4/6, again leading to activation of Rb1 and senescence (32Ramirez R.D.

Tumor suppression by Ink4a-Arf: progress and puzzles.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Beyond p16 and inhibition of cdk4/6, other cdk inhibitors including p21, p27, and p57 inhibit cdks important for Rb1-independent events in cell cycle progression. Interestingly, Rb1 is important in maintaining constitutive repression of these various cdk inhibitors: each of the inhibitors is modestly induced in TKO MEFs compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 4A) (5Dannenberg J.H. van Rossum A. Schuijff L. te Riele H.

However, it is of note that proliferation of TKO MEFs is blocked if p21 and p27 become further elevated. When TKO MEFs are deprived of mitogens, they arrest in G2, and this arrest is linked to induction of p21 and p27 (34Foijer F. Wolthuis R.M. Doodeman V. Medema R.H. te Riele H.

https://openalex.org/W2062655258,"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is the most potent Ca(2+)-mobilizing messenger that releases Ca(2+) from endolysosomal organelles. Recent studies showed that NAADP-induced Ca(2+) release is mediated by the two-pore channels (TPCs) TPC1 and TPC2. However, the expression of TPCs and the NAADP-induced local Ca(2+) signals have not been examined in vascular smooth muscle. Here, we found that both TPC1 and TPC2 are expressed in rat pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), with TPC1 being the major subtype. Application of membrane-permeant NAADP acetoxymethyl ester to PASMCs elicited a biphasic increase in global [Ca(2+)]i, which was independent of extracellular Ca(2+) and blocked by the NAADP antagonist Ned-19 or the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1, indicating Ca(2+) release from acidic endolysosomal Ca(2+) stores. The Ca(2+) response was unaffected by xestospongin C but was partially blocked by ryanodine or thapsigargin. NAADP triggered heterogeneous local Ca(2+) signals, including a diffuse increase in cytosolic [Ca(2+)], Ca(2+) sparks, Ca(2+) bursts, and regenerative Ca(2+) release. The diffuse Ca(2+) increase and Ca(2+) bursts were ryanodine-insensitive, presumably arising from different endolysosomal sources. Ca(2+) sparks and regenerative Ca(2+) release were inhibited by ryanodine, consistent with cross-activation of loosely coupled ryanodine receptors. Moreover, Ca(2+) release stimulated by endothelin-1 was inhibited by Ned-19, ryanodine, or xestospongin C, suggesting that NAADP-mediated Ca(2+) signals interact with both ryanodine and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors during agonist stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W2094350460,"Nicotinamide, a soluble compound of the vitamin B3 group, has antimicrobial activity against several microorganisms ranging from viruses to parasite protozoans. However, the mode of action of this antimicrobial activity is unknown. Here, we investigate the trypanocidal activity of nicotinamide on Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis. Incubation of trypanosomes with nicotinamide causes deleterious defects in endocytic traffic, disruption of the lysosome, failure of cytokinesis, and, ultimately, cell death. At the same concentrations there was no effect on a cultured mammalian cell line. The effects on endocytosis and vesicle traffic were visible within 3 h and can be attributed to inhibition of lysosomal cathepsin b-like protease activity. The inhibitory effect of nicotinamide was confirmed by a direct activity assay of recombinant cathepsin b-like protein. Taken together, these data demonstrate that inhibition of the lysosomal protease cathepsin b-like blocks endocytosis, causing cell death. In addition, these results demonstrate for the first time the inhibitory effect of nicotinamide on a protease."
https://openalex.org/W2070354264,"Natural killer (NK) cells are important for innate immunity in particular through the production of IFN-γ and GM-CSF. Both cytokines are important in restoration of immune function of tolerized leukocytes under inflammatory events. The expression of TLRs in NK cells has been widely studied by analyzing the mRNA of these receptors, rarely seeking their protein expression. We previously showed that murine spleen NK cells express TLR9 intracellularly and respond to CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) by producing IFN-γ and GM-CSF. However, to get such production the presence of accessory cytokines (such as IL-15 and IL-18) was required, whereas CpG-ODN or accessory cytokines alone did not induce IFN-γ or GM-CSF. We show here that TLR9 overlaps with the Golgi apparatus in NK cells. Furthermore, CpG-ODN stimulation in the presence of accessory cytokines induces the phosphorylation of c-Jun, STAT3, and IκBα. IFN-γ and GM-CSF production requires NF-κB and STAT3 activation as well as Erk-dependent mechanisms for IFN-γ and p38 signaling for GM-CSF. Using knock-out-mice, we show that UNC93b1 and IL-12 (produced by NK cells themselves) are also necessary for IFN-γ and GM-CSF production. IFN-γ production was found to be MyD88- and TLR9-dependent, whereas GM-CSF was TLR9-independent but dependent on STING (stimulator of interferon genes), a cytosolic adaptor recently described for DNA sensing. Our study thereby allows us to gain insight into the mechanisms of synergy between accessory cytokines and CpG-ODN in NK cells.

Natural killer (NK) 3The abbreviations used are: NKnatural killerTLRToll-like receptorANOVAanalysis of variance. cells are important actors of innate immunity with a predominant role during viral infections. It has now been clearly established that NK cells also play a key role during bacterial infection (for review see, Ref. 1Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes F. Adib-Conquy M. Cavaillon J.M. Natural killer (NK) cells in antibacterial innate immunity: angels or devils?.Mol. Med. 2012; 18: 270-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). NK cells contribute to the inflammatory reaction by the production of many cytokines, particularly two potent immune-stimulatory cytokines IFN-γ and GM-CSF, with each playing a key role in innate immunity (2Hayakawa Y.

IFN-γ is a well known proinflammatory cytokine and has been recognized as a factor involved in endotoxin-induced lethality (4Doherty G.M. Lange J.R. Langstein H.N. Alexander H.R. Buresh C.M.

GM-CSF has similarly been shown to contribute to many inflammatory disorders (6Hamilton J.A.

NK cells have been shown to express Toll-like receptors (TLRs), primarily determined by PCR measurement of TLR transcript, whereas few have demonstrated expression at the protein level.

Direct TLR2 signaling is critical for NK cell activation and function in response to vaccinia viral infection.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000811Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We recently showed that murine NK cells do indeed express TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 at the protein level. In contrast to other leukocytes such as macrophages in which TLR2 and TLR4 are present on the surface, NK cells express these receptors intracellularly, similarly to TLR9 (11Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes F. Parlato M. Fitting C. Cavaillon J.M. Adib-Conquy M. NK cell tolerance to Toll-like receptor agonists mediated by regulatory T cells after polymicrobial sepsis.J. Immunol. 2012; 188: 5850-5858Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Additionally, we found that purified splenic naive NK cells were highly responsive to CpG-ODN, a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide mimicking bacterial DNA recognized as an agonist of TLR9. CpG-ODN is a potent inducer of IFN-γ and GM-CSF, but only in the presence of accessory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-15, and/or IL-18 (11Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes F. Parlato M. Fitting C. Cavaillon J.M. Adib-Conquy M. NK cell tolerance to Toll-like receptor agonists mediated by regulatory T cells after polymicrobial sepsis.J. Immunol. 2012; 188: 5850-5858Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which alone are unable to induce cytokine production. Thus, NK cells require two signals for IFN-γ and GM-CSF production: from accessory cytokines and from the receptors sensing CpG-ODN. The aim of the present study was to decipher the mechanisms involved in IFN-γ and GM-CSF induction and to identify the intracellular actors during production. We are first to report that TLR9 expression overlaps with the Golgi apparatus in NK cells. We found that CpG-ODN stimulation in the presence of accessory cytokines induces the phosphorylation of c-Jun, STAT3, and IκBα. IFN-γ and GM-CSF production requires NF-κB and STAT3 activation as well as Erk-dependent mechanisms for IFN-γ and p38 signaling for GM-CSF. Using knock-out mice GM-CSF production was surprisingly MyD88- and TLR9-independent in contrast to IFN-γ, which used the classical CpG-ODN sensing via TLR9. Therefore, we investigated the possible role of the STING (stimulator of interferon genes), a cytosolic adaptor recently described and associated with TLR-independent sensing of bacterial DNA (12Prantner D.

Our results indicate that NK cell cytokine production may occur independently of TLR9, yet require STING and UNC93b1 as well as NK-produced IL-12. Antibodies against the following antigens were used: anti-IL-12p40/p70-PE, anti-NKp46-V450, and anti-NKp46-A647 were from BD Biosciences, and anti-TLR9/CD289-A488 was from Imgenex (San Diego, CA). The corresponding isotype and fluorophore controls were obtained from the same companies. For immunofluorescence, the antibodies against the following antigens were used: anti-TMEM173-STING from Acris Antibodies GmbH (Herford, Germany) and anti-p65 from Cellular Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The corresponding secondary antibody, conjugated with Texas Red and A488 respectively, were obtained from the same companies. The FcReceptor-blocking reagent and the Inside stain kit were obtained from Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany). The murine recombinant cytokines (IL-2, IL-15) were from Peprotech, and IL-18 was from Medical and Biological Laboratories. ELISA kits to detect GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were obtained from R&D Systems and used according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The multiplex combination used to detect phosphorylated AKT, ERK1–2, Iκβα, c-Jun, JNK, p38, STAT2, and STAT3 was provided by Bio-Rad Laboratories. The murine CpG-ODN sequence was as follows: 5′-TCCATGACGTTCCTGATGCT-3′ and was synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). The corresponding CpG-ODN sequence was customized to be coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (A488) by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The inhibitors were as follows: Pepinh-MYD (MyD88, 20 μm) was obtained from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA); Stattic was used at 1 μm (STAT3), SP600125 at 10 μm (c-Jun), Bay 11-7085 at 1 μm (NF-κB), and SB203580 at 10 μm (p38) were from TOCRIS Bioscience (Bristol, UK); 10 μm LY294002 (PI3K) and 20 μm PD-98059 (ERK1,2) were from Calbiochem. The nucleus and Golgi apparatus probes Hoechst 33342 and BODIPY-TR ceramide, respectively, were obtained from Invitrogen. radioimmune precipitation assay buffer was obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Studies were performed with 8- to 12-week-old male mice. The wild-type C57BL/6(J) was obtained from Janvier (Le Genest-St.-Isle, France). The transgenic mice in a C57BL/6 background were obtained as follows: il-12r2β−/− mice from the Transgenose Institute animal breeding facility (Orléans, France); the ifn-α/βR, ifn-γ, myd88, and tlr9−/− mice from the animal facility of the Institut Pasteur (Paris, France); the trif−/− mice from the animal facility of the A*STAR Singapore Immunology Network (Singapore); the sting-deficient mice and unc93b1−/− from the animal facility of the University of Massachusetts Medical School (Worcester, MA). Animals were housed in the animal facilities under specific pathogen-free conditions. Protocols, performed in compliance with the NIH Animal Welfare Insurance no. A5476-01 issued on 02/07/2007, were approved by the veterinary team of the Institut Pasteur animal facility. NK cells were enriched from spleen homogenates by negative selection using the NK cell isolation kit on untouched mouse NK cells (Miltenyi Biotec) as described previously (11Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes F. Parlato M. Fitting C. Cavaillon J.M. Adib-Conquy M. NK cell tolerance to Toll-like receptor agonists mediated by regulatory T cells after polymicrobial sepsis.J. Immunol. 2012; 188: 5850-5858Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). NK cell purity was assessed by flow cytometry after CD3−NKp46+ staining and was >95%. After purification, cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 (LONZA, Rockland, ME) supplemented with 10% FCS (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria), streptomycin at 0.1 mg/ml, and penicillin at 100u/ml (Sigma-Aldrich). For GM-CSF and IFN-γ measurements, cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in the presence or absence of IL-15 and IL-18 (10 ng/ml) and CpG-ODN (1 μm). In some experiments, peritoneal cells were prepared and cultured as described previously and were used as controls (14Fitting C. Dhawan S. Cavaillon J.M. Compartmentalization of tolerance to endotoxin.J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 1295-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For the in vitro Golgi/TLR9 co-localization assay, purified NK cells were first incubated 30 min at 4 °C in the presence of the BODIPY-TR probe at 5 μm, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and stained for intracellular TLR9. The same intracellular stain protocol was used to stain STING in naive cells, and p65 as described by Gouin et al. (15Gouin E. Adib-Conquy M. Balestrino D. Nahori M.A. Villiers V. Colland F. Dramsi S. Dussurget O. Cossart P. The Listeria monocytogenes InlC protein interferes with innate immune responses by targeting the IκB kinase subunit IKKα.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 17333-17338Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (after IL-15, IL-18, and CpG-ODN stimulation). For the STING co-localization assay, a CpG-DNA coupled to A647 was used (1 μm). The staining was analyzed using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. To perform the bioplex to detect the phosphorylated signaling proteins, 3 × 106 NK cells per test were cultured in culture tubes for 30 min or 1 h in the presence or absence of the IL-15, IL-18, IL-15/IL-18 (10 ng/ml), and/or CpG-ODN (1 μm). Cells were then resuspended and homogenized in 50 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Cell lysates were kept at −80 °C until analysis. NK cell surface antigens were labeled in staining buffer (PBS, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5% FCS) with antibodies at the concentration suggested by the manufacturers. Intracellular staining was performed after fixation and permeabilization of the cells using the Inside Stain kit (Myltenyi Biotec), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All flow cytometry data were acquired and analyzed on a MACSQuant flow cytometer (Myltenyi Biotec). All experiments were performed at least three times, using at least n = 3 mice per assay. One-way ANOVA and Fisher least significance difference test were used for statistical analysis. A p value < 0.05 was considered to be significant. We previously showed by flow cytometry that similar to myeloid cells, TLR9 was intracellular in murine NK cells (11Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes F. Parlato M. Fitting C. Cavaillon J.M. Adib-Conquy M. NK cell tolerance to Toll-like receptor agonists mediated by regulatory T cells after polymicrobial sepsis.J. Immunol. 2012; 188: 5850-5858Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present report we confirmed this finding and in addition showed by confocal microscopy that TLR9 overlaps with the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 1A). A more precise localization is however difficult in primary NK cells because of the small cytosol in this cell type. To better understand the signaling of CpG-ODN in NK cells, we analyzed the phosphorylation of signaling molecules described in the literature to be induced by accessory cytokines (IL-15/IL-18) or CpG-ODN. Whole cell extracts were prepared after 30 or 60 min of stimulation and analyzed by the Bioplex technology. Within these molecules, we observed that IL-15 and IL-18 alone and/or together induced the phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig. 1B). In the presence of CpG-ODN and IL-15/IL-18 c-Jun phosphorylation was consistent at 30 min but appeared more sustained at 1 h as compared with IL-15/IL-18 alone. CpG and IL-18 also induced STAT3 phosphorylation and the level was again higher when stimulatory cytokines and CpG-ODN were added simultaneously. Finally, CpG-ODN and stimulatory cytokines added alone induced some phosphorylation on IκBα with higher p-IκBα observed when both CpG-ODN and IL-15/IL-18 were present simultaneously. p38 and ERK were phosphorylated after stimulation with CpG, IL-15/18, or their combination, but the level of activation was comparable for all conditions. No synergistic effect was observed (data not shown). No difference in the phosphorylation of the signaling molecules AKT, JNK, or STAT2 was observed (data not shown). The contribution of various signaling molecules on IFN-γ and GM-CSF production was also analyzed using specific inhibitors (Fig. 1C). The optimal concentration for each inhibitory drug was chosen according to the literature (16Brandt B. Abou-Eladab E. Tiedge M. Walzel H.

Cell Physiol. 2011; 300: C850-C859Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). CpG-ODN or IL-15/IL-18 alone did not induce any IFN-γ or GM-CSF secretion. In contrast, when co-signaling they synergized inducing thousands of pg/ml of both cytokines. This induction was completely abolished by specific inhibitors of STAT3 or NF-κB and partially diminished by the ERK1/2 inhibitor for IFN-γ and by p38 inhibitor for GM-CSF. Purified NK cells were primed overnight with IL-15 and IL-18 and then challenged with CpG-ODN. Nuclear translocation of p65 was measured by immunofluorescence after 60-min stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2A, no or low nuclear localization of NF-κB was present in cells stimulated with CpG-ODN or IL-15/IL-18 alone. Similarly, no nuclear localization was seen in unstimulated cells (control, image not shown). In contrast, immunofluorescence staining of the p65 subunit revealed a high nuclear localization of this transcription factor after CpG-ODN + IL-15/IL-18 challenge. Cells were counted in order to estimate the percentage of nucleus positive for p65 (Fig. 2B). The percentage of positive cells for nuclear p65 was ∼20% in cells treated with CpG-ODN or IL-15/IL-18 alone but reached 75% when both stimuli were present. Using deficient mice, we evaluated whether IFN-γ and GM-CSF productions were fully dependent of the TLR9 signaling pathway for NK cells. In the case of IFN-γ, we demonstrated an absence of production in myd88 and tlr9−/− NK cells (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, IFN-γ production was also abolished in the absence of UNC93b1, a molecule important for TLR9 migration from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus (21Kim Y.M. Brinkmann M.M. Paquet M.E. Ploegh H.L. UNC93B1 delivers nucleotide-sensing toll-like receptors to endolysosomes.Nature. 2008; 452: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). In addition, we found a partial effect of STING, a newly described adaptor involved in cytoplasmic sensing double-stranded DNA (22Ishikawa H. Ma Z. Barber G.N. STING regulates intracellular DNA-mediated, type I interferon-dependent innate immunity.Nature. 2009; 461: 788-U740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar), on IFN-γ production by NK cells. Indeed, IFN-γ levels were significantly decreased for STING deficient NK cells identifying a new actor involved in CpG-ODN sensing. As shown in Fig. 3A, the absence of STING did not totally abolish IFN-γ production, but its presence was necessary for optimal production. The remaining IFN-γ production was completely abolished when sting−/− NK cells were incubated with a MyD88 inhibitor (MyD88 peptide), suggesting the existence of two pathways for CpG-ODN sensing: one involving STING and one needing the adaptor protein MyD88 for downstream signaling. For GM-CSF, the results were more striking and surprising, considering no significant alteration of GM-CSF production in myd88 or tlr9−/− NK cells was found. In contrast, GM-CSF production was profoundly and significantly altered in the absence of STING. Similar to IFN-γ, GM-CSF production was totally abolished if, in addition to STING, the MyD88-dependent pathway was blocked. As expected, the production of both cytokines was independent of TRIF (TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β), which was used as a negative control. We also investigated a possible role of IFN-α/β. Using ifn-α/βR−/− NK cells, we showed that indeed they do not participate in the induction mechanisms of IFN-γ or GM-CSF. Finally, we investigated whether IFN-γ or GM-CSF may participate in one another's induction. For this purpose, we utilized ifn-g−/− NK cells to study the influence on GM-CSF and anti-GM-CSF blocking antibodies to measure the effect of GM-CSF on IFN-γ production. Our results indicate that the lack of IFN-γ had no influence on GM-CSF, and the blockage of GM-CSF did not alter IFN-γ production. To determine whether the TLR9-independent and STING-dependent cytokine production was specific of NK cells, we measured cytokine production by macrophages in response to CpG-ODN. Because GM-CSF production was extremely low (below 30 pg/ml), we measured IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF (Fig. 4). We found that cytokine production by STING deficient macrophages was not reduced as compared with WT macrophages, whereas it was significantly diminished in the absence of MyD88, TLR9, or with the blockade of MyD88 (MyD peptide) as classically reported. In contrast to STING, the response to CpG-ODN in macrophages was dependent on UNC93b1, similar to NK cells. Interestingly, the production of IFN-γ and GM-CSF by NK cells was totally abolished in the absence of IL-12Rβ2, one of the two chains forming the IL-12 receptor (Fig. 3, A and B). IL-12 is usually derived from accessory cells but considering the high experimental purity (>95%), the capacity of NK cells to produce IL-12 and self-activate by an autocrine action was considered. We chose to analyze IL-12 production by flow cytometry and intracellular staining for two reasons. First, IL-12 production may be below the threshold of classical ELISA, and second, the cytokine may be consumed by NK cells themselves. A tangential example is type I IFNs, which are easily measured by RT-PCR but very hard to detect by ELISA in culture supernatants. As shown in Fig. 3C, IL-12-positive NK cells were barely detected when stimulated by CpG-ODN or IL-15/IL-18 alone, both in terms of percentage of positive cells and mean fluorescence intensity. In contrast, IL-15/IL-18 and CpG-ODN synergized and induced a significant increase in IL-12-positive NK cells. Although in these culture conditions the percentage of positive cells remained low, IL-12 was significantly increased in comparison to unstimulated cells or cells stimulated with CpG-ODN or IL-15/IL-18 alone. The different stimulations (CpG-ODN and/or accessory cytokines) had no effect on the expression of the IL-12Rβ2 chain. Finally, we investigated whether STING and CpG-ODN overlapped in NK cells. As shown in Fig. 3D, STING was strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of NK cells. The figure shows NK cells stimulated with IL-15/IL-18 and CpG-ODN, but the result was similar without accessory cytokines. It can be seen, thanks to A488-labeled CpG-ODN, that there is an uptake of the oligodeoxynucleotide by the NK cells. Confocal microscopy shows that STING and CpG-ODN overlap in different locations within the NK cells (white arrows in the merge). In a previous report, we showed by flow cytometry that similar to myeloid cells, TLR9 was intracellular in murine NK cells (11Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes F. Parlato M. Fitting C. Cavaillon J.M. Adib-Conquy M. NK cell tolerance to Toll-like receptor agonists mediated by regulatory T cells after polymicrobial sepsis.J. Immunol. 2012; 188: 5850-5858Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). TLR9 is a pattern recognition receptor sensing unmethylated bacterial DNA whose triggering is mimicked by CpG-ODN. CpG-ODN stimulation induced cytokine production by macrophages and dendritic cell maturation, a response that was absent for cells from tlr9−/− mice (23Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K. Akira S. A Toll-like receptor recognizes bacterial DNA.Nature. 2000; 408: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5360) Google Scholar). Additionally, the TLR adaptor protein MyD88 is involved, co-localized with TLR9, and tagged CpG-ODN into the endosome compartment (24Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. TLR9 signals after translocating from the ER to CpG DNA in the lysosome.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). In the present report, we confirmed the intracellular localization of TLR9 in NK cells and in addition showed that it overlaps with the Golgi apparatus. In a previous study, we also found that purified splenic naive NK cells were highly responsive to CpG-ODN, in terms of IFN-γ and GM-CSF production, but only in the presence of accessory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-15, and/or IL-18 (11Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes F. Parlato M. Fitting C. Cavaillon J.M. Adib-Conquy M. NK cell tolerance to Toll-like receptor agonists mediated by regulatory T cells after polymicrobial sepsis.J.

To better understand the synergy between accessory cytokines (IL-15/IL-18) and CpG-ODN and their signaling in NK cells, we analyzed the phosphorylation of signaling molecules described in the literature to be induced by them. We found that IL-15 and IL-18 alone and/or together induced the phosphorylation of c-Jun and IκBα, which is consistent with the literature, where IL-15 has been shown to activate the JNK and NF-κB pathways in myeloid cells (25Chenoweth M.J. Mian M.F. Barra N.G. Alain T. Sonenberg N. Bramson J. Lichty B.D. Richards C.D. Ma A. Ashkar A.A. IL-15 Can Signal via IL-15Rα, JNK, and NF-κB To Drive RANTES Production by Myeloid Cells.J. Immunol. 2012; 188: 4149-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in the presence of CpG-ODN and IL-15/IL-18, their phosphorylation appeared more sustained at 1 h as compared with IL-15/IL-18 alone. CpG-ODN and IL-18 also induced STAT3 phosphorylation, and the level was again higher when stimulatory cytokines and CpG-ODN were added simultaneously. The contribution of NF-κB and STAT3 on IFN-γ and GM-CSF production by NK cells was confirmed using specific inhibitors. In addition, using microscopy and immunofluorescence, we showed that no or low nuclear localization of NF-κB was present in cells stimulated with CpG-ODN or IL-15/IL-18 alone. In contrast, the p65 subunit of NF-κB revealed a high nuclear localization after challenge with both CpG-ODN and IL-15/IL-18. Finally, using specific inhibitors, we observed that IFN-γ and GM-CSF secretion was independent of PI3K but partially dependent on ERK1/2 for IFN-γ and p38 for GM-CSF. Using deficient mice, we evaluated whether IFN-γ and GM-CSF productions were fully dependent of the TLR9 signaling pathway for NK cells. In the case of IFN-γ, we demonstrated an absence of production in myd88 and tlr9−/− NK cells, which was consistent with the literature. Interestingly, IFN-γ production was also absent in unc93b1−/− NK cells. UNC93b1 has been described to play an important role for TLR9 migration from the endoplasmic reticulum, where TLR9 is retained (26Tabeta K. Hoebe K. Janssen E.M. Du X. Georgel P. Crozat K. Mudd S. Mann N. Sovath S. Goode J. Shamel L. Herskovits A.A. Portnoy D.A. Cooke M. Tarantino L.M. Wiltshire T. Steinberg B.E. Grinstein S. Beutler B. The Unc93b1 mutation 3d disrupts exogenous antigen presentation and signaling via Toll-like receptors 3, 7 and 9.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), to the Golgi apparatus, and then to the endosomal compartment where it encounter its agonist hypomethylated DNA after cellular uptake (27Leifer C.A. Kennedy M.N. Mazzoni A. Lee C. Kruhlak M.J. Segal D.M. TLR9 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum prior to stimulation.J.

Signal. 2010; 3: pe45Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, we found a partial effect of STING on IFN-γ production by NK cells. Indeed, IFN-γ levels were significantly decreased for STING-deficient NK cells identifying a new actor involved in CpG-ODN sensing. STING is a newly described cytoplasmic adaptor involved in the sensing double-stranded DNA (22Ishikawa H. Ma Z. Barber G.N. STING regulates intracellular DNA-mediated, type I interferon-dependent innate immunity.Nature. 2009; 461: 788-U740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar), which localizes near the endoplasmic reticulum in the presence of intracellular DNA (29Ishikawa H. Barber G.N. STING is an endoplasmic reticulum adaptor that facilitates innate immune signaling.Nature. 2008; 455: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). We found that STING absence was necessary for optimal IFN-γ production by NK cells. In contrast to IFN-γ, which was mostly dependent on the classical TLR9 and MyD88 pathway, GM-CSF production was profoundly and significantly altered in the absence of STING and UNC93b1. Thus, we identified STING as a new actor in CpG-ODN sensing in NK cells, adding an intracytoplasmic detection of DNA in addition to the classical endosomal TLR9-dependent detection system. STING is involved in cytosolic DNA sensing, but it is an ER adaptor protein (29Ishikawa H. Barber G.N. STING is an endoplasmic reticulum adaptor that facilitates innate immune signaling.Nature. 2008; 455: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). Regarding UNC93b1, it has been predicted to be a multispanning transmembrane protein (30Kashuba V.I. Protopopov A.I. Kvasha S.M. Gizatullin R.Z. Wahlestedt C. Kisselev L.L. Klein G. Zabarovsky E.R. hUNC93B1: a novel human gene representing a new gene family and encoding an unc-93-like protein.Gene. 2002; 283: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and similarly to STING has been located in the ER (31Brinkmann M.M. Spooner E. Hoebe K. Beutler B. Ploegh H.L. Kim Y.M. The interaction between the ER membrane protein UNC93B and TLR3, 7, and 9 is crucial for TLR signaling.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Thus, one can make the assumption that UNC93b1 may be also important for STING function and/or correct location, as already shown for TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9. The TLR9-independent and STING-dependent cytokine production was specific of NK cells and was not found in macrophages. This negative result in macrophages does not exclude a role of STING in other cell types. For example, Landrigan et al. (32Landrigan A. Wong M.T. Utz P.J. CpG and non-CpG oligodeoxynucleotides directly costimulate mouse and human CD4+ T cells through a TLR9- and MyD88-independent mechanism.J. Immunol. 2011; 187: 3033-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) recently identified a TLR9-, MyD88-, and endosomal-independent sensing of CpG-ODN in CD4+ T lymphocytes but did not identify the receptor responsible for CPG-ODN detection. It would be intriguing to verify whether similarly to NK cells, STING is the molecule involved in this sensing in T lymphocytes. In contrast to STING the response to CpG-ODN in macrophages was dependent on UNC93b1, similar to NK cells. The latter is most probably due to the fact that UNC93b1 allows the endosomal localization of TLR9, as reported previously (21Kim Y.M. Brinkmann M.M. Paquet M.E. Ploegh H.L. UNC93B1 delivers nucleotide-sensing toll-like receptors to endolysosomes.Nature. 2008; 452: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Finally, we found that STING and CpG-ODN overlapped in NK cells. This result is consistent with the observation by Hagele et al. (33Hägele H. Allam R. Pawar R.D. Reichel C.A. Krombach F. Anders H.J. Double-stranded DNA activates glomerular endothelial cells and enhances albumin permeability via a toll-like receptor-independent cytosolic DNA recognition pathway.Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 175: 1896-1904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that DNA oligonucleotides present in endosomes may reach the cytoplasm. The existence of STING as an alternative cytosolic sensor for bacterial DNA may be an advantage for the detection of intracytoplasmic bacteria. As expected, the production of both cytokines was independent of TRIF. This result is in accordance with the literature where TRIF has been shown to be involved in TLR3 and TLR4 signaling pathways (34Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. Cutting edge: a novel Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adapter that preferentially activates the IFN-β promoter in the Toll-like receptor signaling.J.

Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) but not TLR9. We also investigated a possible role of IFN-α/β, considering type I interferons have been described to prime NK cells for cytotoxicity or IFN-γ production (36Beuneu H. Deguine J. Bouvier I. Di Santo J.P. Albert M.L. Bousso P. Cutting Edge: A dual role for type I IFNs during polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-induced NK cell activation.J.

IL-15 and type I interferon are required for activation of tumoricidal NK cells by virus-infected dendritic cells.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 2497-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Even if this effect appears to be related to antiviral response and sensing of poly-I:C (dsRNA), we wanted to ensure that type I interferons did not affect NK cell response to CpG-ODN. Using inf-α/βR −/− NK cells, we showed that indeed they do not participate in the induction mechanisms of IFN-γ or GM-CSF. Our results indicate that the lack of IFN-γ had no influence on GM-CSF and the blockage of GM-CSF did not alter IFN-γ production. In contrast and interestingly, the production of IFN-γ and GM-CSF by NK cells was totally abolished in the absence of IL-12Rβ2, one of the two chains forming the IL-12 receptor. This suggests that IL-12 is necessary for the priming of NK cells, whereas IL-2, IL-15, and IL-18 alone or in combination are unable to induce cytokine production by murine NK cells. IL-12 is the only cytokine able to activate NK cells without the need of additional stimulus such as TLR agonists (3Huntington N.D. Vosshenrich C.A. Di Santo J.P.

Immunol. 2012; 188: 5850-5858Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). IL-12 is usually derived from accessory cells but considering the high experimental purity (>95%), the capacity of NK cells to produce IL-12 and self-activate by an autocrine action was considered. We show that IL-15/IL-18 and CpG-ODN synergized and induced a significant increase in IL-12-positive NK cells. The different stimulations (CpG-ODN and/or accessory cytokines) had no effect on the expression of the IL-12Rβ2 chain. Taken together, the present data underlie the existence of an alternative mechanism of sensing and response to CpG-ODN, a typical TLR9 agonist. This signaling pathway in NK cells involves STING, a recently described cytosolic adaptor involved in the sensing of DNA. This pathway contributes fully to GM-CSF production by NK cells and partially to that of IFNγ. Furthermore, the production of both cytokines is dependent on IL-12, produced by NK cells themselves. Detection of bacterial DNA contributes to the immune response for several infections. The discovery of this alternative pathway brings insight into the understanding of bacterial DNA sensing and may be useful for the design of new vaccine adjuvant therapies.

Chemotaxis is driven by chemoattractants, produced by various cell types, as well as by intrinsic cellular regulators, which are poorly understood. In this study we prepared a new mAb specific for the tetraspanin CD9. Binding of the antibody to bone marrow-derived mast cells triggered activation events that included cell degranulation, Ca(2+) response, dephosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family proteins, and potent tyrosine phosphorylation of the non-T cell activation linker (NTAL) but only weak phosphorylation of the linker for activation of T cells (LAT). Phosphorylation of the NTAL was observed with whole antibody but not with its F(ab)(2) or Fab fragments. This indicated involvement of the Fcγ receptors. As documented by electron microscopy of isolated plasma membrane sheets, CD9 colocalized with the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) and NTAL but not with LAT. Further tests showed that both anti-CD9 antibody and its F(ab)(2) fragment inhibited mast cell chemotaxis toward antigen. Experiments with bone marrow-derived mast cells deficient in NTAL and/or LAT revealed different roles of these two adaptors in antigen-driven chemotaxis. The combined data indicate that chemotaxis toward antigen is controlled in mast cells by a cross-talk among FcεRI, tetraspanin CD9, transmembrane adaptor proteins NTAL and LAT, and cytoskeleton-regulatory proteins of the ERM family."

The aim of this study was to find out whether HBV or its components [HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBV core protein (HBc), and HBV X protein (HBx)] could interfere with the host DNA damage response and repair pathway. The full HBV genome or individual HBV open-reading frame (ORF) was introduced into HepG2 cells to examine the effect on host genomic stability, DNA repair efficacy in response to double-strand DNA damage, and DNA damage-induced cell death. Responses to apoptosis induction in the HBV ORF-transfected HepG2 cells were also compared with those in HBV-positive and HBV-negative human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In the absence of HBV replication, accumulation of HBsAg in liver cells without other HBV proteins enhanced DNA repair protein and tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia (PML) degradation, which resulted in resistance to apoptosis induction and deficient double-strand DNA repair. However, HBsAg-positive cells exhibited increased cell death with exposure to the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor that blocks single-strand DNA repair. These results indicate that suppression of PML by HBsAg disrupts cellular mechanisms that respond to double-strand DNA damage for DNA repair or apoptosis induction, which may facilitate hepatocarcinogenesis and open up a synthetic lethality strategy for HBsAg-positive HCC treatment.—Chung, Y.-L.

Mutations in NST genes cause human and cattle diseases and impaired cell walls of yeast and fungi. Information regarding their function in the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, a causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, is unknown. Here, we characterized the substrate specificities of four NSTs, TbNST1-4, which are expressed in both the insect procyclic form (PCF) and mammalian bloodstream form (BSF) stages. TbNST1/2 transports UDP-Gal/UDP-GlcNAc, TbNST3 transports GDP-Man, and TbNST4 transports UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc, and GDP-Man. TbNST4 is the first NST shown to transport both pyrimidine and purine nucleotide sugars and is demonstrated here to be localized at the Golgi apparatus. RNAi-mediated silencing of TbNST4 in the procyclic form caused underglycosylated surface glycoprotein EP-procyclin. Similarly, defective glycosylation of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG221) as well as the lysosomal membrane protein p67 was observed in Δtbnst4 BSF T. brucei. Relative infectivity analysis showed that defects in glycosylation of the surface coat resulting from tbnst4 deletion were insufficient to impact the ability of this parasite to infect mice. Notably, the fact that inactivation of a single NST gene results in measurable defects in surface glycoproteins in different life cycle stages of the parasite highlights the essential role of NST(s) in glycosylation of T. brucei. Thus, results presented in this study provide a framework for conducting functional analyses of other NSTs identified in T. brucei."

We performed experiments in the absence of light and feeding-time cues to test which core clock genes are controlled by CREM/ICER in the liver and adrenal gland. In vivo, Crem loss-of-function mutation resulted in fine-tuning of all measured adrenal clock genes (Per1/2/3, Cry1/2, Bmal1, and Rev-erbα), whereas only Per1 and Cry1 were affected in the liver.

The expression of both Icer and Per1 genes responded to cAMP stimuli in an immediate-early fashion. In immortal cells, forskolin induced expression of Per1 after 2 h, and de novo protein synthesis led to Per1 attenuation. We show that the de novo synthesized protein responsible for Per1 attenuation is ICER. Indeed, Per1 expression is up-regulated in cells ectopically expressing antisense Icer, and mobility shift experiments identified ICER binding to cAMP-responsive elements of the Per1 promoter.

The circadian clock is an internal timekeeper that enables organisms to predict and adapt to daily changes in light intensity, food accessibility, predator activity, etc. Its organization in mammals is hierarchical: the central oscillator lies in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) 3The abbreviations used are: SCNsuprachiasmatic nucleusCREcAMP-responsive elementKOknock-outZTzeitgeber timeANOVAanalysis of variance. and is reset daily with dawn light.

This means that on the periphery, tissue-specific modulators such as feeding and hormones and their downstream signaling pathways contribute to regulation of peripheral clocks. The liver clock is preferentially entrained by feeding-associated cues (4Bur I.M. Zouaoui S. Fontanaud P. Coutry N. Molino F. Martin A.O. Mollard P. Bonnefont X.

An important signaling pathway in steroid hormone synthesis is cAMP-dependent regulation by the PAR bZip (proline- and acid-rich basic leucine zipper) transcription factors of the CREB (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein)/CREM (cAMP-responsive element modulator)/ATF family. These proteins form homodimers or heterodimers that act as repressors or activators of transcription and have several splice variants (8Laoide B.M. Foulkes N.S. Schlotter F. Sassone-Corsi P. The functional versatility of CREM is determined by its modular structure.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The positive loop (activation) of cAMP signaling is usually phosphorylation of CREB or CREM activators and their subsequent binding to cAMP-responsive element (CRE) sites of cAMP-responsive genes. The negative loop (repression) can involve dephosphorylation or binding of ICER (inducible cAMP early repressor) to CRE sites (9Servillo G. Della Fazia M.A. Sassone-Corsi P.

The difference between CREM and other PAR bZip relatives is inducibility by cAMP: the immediate-early repressor Icer is transcribed in a cAMP-dependent fashion through phospho-CREB binding to CREs, which is the same mechanism that is important for resetting of the circadian clock (10Tischkau S.A.

Coupling cAMP signaling to transcription in the liver: pivotal role of CREB and CREM.Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 275: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In hepatocellular carcinoma, increased intracellular cAMP resulted in elevated levels of Icer mRNA and protein, which were proposed to inhibit hepatocyte mitogenesis (13Kovach S.J. Price J.A. Shaw C.M. Theodorakis N.G. McKillop I.H. Role of cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding (CREB) proteins in cell proliferation in a rat model of hepatocellular carcinoma.J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 206: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the adrenal gland, ICER seems to be a marker of (lithium) induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal gland axis (14Spencer C.M. Jahng J.W. Ryu V. Houpt T.A. Lithium-induced gene expression of inducible cyclic adenosine monophosphate early repressor in the rat adrenal gland.J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 82: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The link between ICER and the adrenal circadian clock arises from the excellent study of Ishida et al. (6Ishida A. Mutoh T. Ueyama T. Bando H. Masubuchi S. Nakahara D. Tsujimoto G. Okamura H. Light activates the adrenal gland: timing of gene expression and glucocorticoid release.Cell. Metab. 2005; 2: 297-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). They showed that light pulse during the night induces transcription of a variety of genes in the adrenal gland. The most elevated (4.37-fold) were transcripts of Crem, whereas Per1 was the only elevated core clock gene (1.5-fold). Both Crem (P2 promoter) and Per1 contain CREs in their promoters, suggesting that they can respond to identical cAMP stimuli. Herein, we propose ICER as a physiologically relevant modulator that can contribute to fine-tuning of peripheral clocks, particularly in the adrenal gland, where it is expressed in a circadian manner. ICER is a suppressor of cAMP-induced immediate-early transcription of Per1 and can diminish Per1 expression by directly binding to CREs in Per1 promoter. Fifty-four WT and 45 Crem knock-out (KO; Crem−/−) mice (15Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. LeMeur M. Henriksén K. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Spermiogenesis deficiency and germ-cell apoptosis in CREM-mutant mice.Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) were used in the experiment. Animals had free access to food and water and were maintained under a 12/12-h light cycle regime (light on at 7:00 a.m. and light off at 7:00 p.m.). The experiment was approved by the Veterinary Administration of the Republic of Slovenia (license number 34401-9/2008/4) and was conducted in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes (ETS 123) as well as in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for work with laboratory animals. The process of sample preparation and total RNA isolation was described previously (16Košir R. Ačimovič J. Goličnik M. Perše M. Majdič G. Fink M. Rozman D. Determination of reference genes for circadian studies in different tissues and mouse strains.BMC Mol. Biol. 2010; 11: 60Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In brief, mice were killed under dim red light every 4 h during a 24-h period starting at 7 a.m. (zeitgeber time (ZT) 0). Liver and adrenal glands were excised, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Intron-spanning primers were designed for the core clock genes (Table 1). Primer specificity and amplification efficiency were also validated empirically with melting curve and standard curve analysis of a 6-fold dilution series. The primers and probe for Icer were designed by Primer Design Ltd. Normalization was done as described (17Vandesompele J. De Preter K. Pattyn F. Poppe B. Van Roy N. De Paepe A. Speleman F. Accurate normalization of real-time quantitative RT-PCR data by geometric averaging of multiple internal control genes.Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (RESEARCH0034)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using Eq-PCR Wizard. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed in a 384-well format on LightCycler 480 system (Roche Applied Science) using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master for the core clock genes and LightCycler 480 Probes Master (Roche Applied Science) for the Icer gene. PCR consisted of 2.5 μl of Master, 1.15 μl of RNase-free water, 0.6 μl of 300 nm primer mixture, and 0.75 μl of cDNA in a total volume of 5 μl. Three technical replicates were performed for each sample. Cycling conditions were as follows: 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 rounds of 10 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 60 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C. Melting curve analysis for determining the dissociation of PCR products was performed from 65 to 95 °C. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for determining statistically significant differences between KO and WT mice.TABLE 1List of primers that were used for expression analysis of core circadian genes in the liver and adrenal glandGenesNCBI accession no.SequenceEfficiencyReference genesRplp0NM_007475.41.98ForwardCACTGGTCTAGGACCCGAGAAGReverseGGTGCCTCTGGAGATTTTCGHprtNM_013556.21.89ForwardTCCTCCTCAGACCGCTTTTReverseCCTGGTTCATCATCGCTAATCRn18sNR_003278.11.79ForwardCGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTCReverseTTGGCAAATGCTTTCGCTCCore circadian clock genesPer1NM_011065.31.90ForwardTCCTCCTCCTACACTGCCTCTReverseTTGCTGACGACGGATCTTTPer2NM_011066.31.94ForwardCAACACAGACGACAGCATCAReverseTCCTGGTCCTCCTTCAACACPer3NM_011067.12.00ForwardCTGCTCCAACTCAGCTTCCTTTReverseTTAGACAGCAAGGCTCTGGTTCTCry1NM_0077711.98ForwardCCCAGGCTTTTCAAGGAATGGAACAReverseTCTCATCATGGTCATCAGACAGAGGCry2NM_0099632.00ForwardAGGGCTGCCAAGTGCATCATReverseAGGAAGGGACAGATGCCAATAGBmal1NM_0074891.94ForwardGCAGTGCCACTGACTACCAAGAReverseTCCTGGACATTGCATTGCATRev-erbαNM_145434.32.00ForwardACGACCCTGGACTCCAATAAReverseCCATTGGAGCTGTCACTGTAGACrem transcriptIcerNM_001110854.12.00ForwardTGAAACTGATGAGGAGACTGACReverseCAGCCATCACCACACCTTGProbeCTTACCAGATCCCAGCTCCTACTACTGC Open table in a new tab Experimental data were fitted by trigonometric functions as described (18Korenčič A.

Briefly, in addition to the 24-h period, 12-h harmonics were included to reproduce variable waveforms and peak width (Equation 1). xt=a1sin(2τ24 ht)+a2cos(2τ24 ht)+a3sin(2τ12 ht) +a4cos(2τ12 ht)+a5(Eq. 1) To evaluate the differences in gene expression in WT and KO mice, we performed bootstrapping on the original gene expression data. Each time, half of the data points were randomly chosen, and phases were recalculated. After 10 repetitions, results were plotted as box plots. To avoid the effect of differential gene expression levels on amplitudes, fits were subsequently normalized (divided by the mean of expression of each gene in 24 h), and box plots for amplitudes are shown for the normalized fits (see FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3).FIGURE 3Ten repetitions of the bootstrapping method were performed.

Samples of animals from the same time points were pooled to obtain enough protein for ICER detection. Anti-CREM antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and HRP-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Sigma) were applied. As loading controls, anti-β-actin monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used. Detection of CREM was performed with West Femto substrate (Pierce). For detection of actin, we used ECL substrate (Pierce). Detection was done using a Fujifilm LAS 4000 system. Mouse adrenocortical cell line Y-1 (ATCC CCL-79) and mouse hepatoma cell line Hepa 1-6 (ATCC CRL-1830) were grown in DMEM (Sigma D7777) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma F9665). When cells were confluent, they were cultured in serum-free DMEM and treated with different chemicals dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma), 10 μm forskolin (Sigma), 25 μm cycloheximide (Sigma), and 25 μm H-89 (Sigma). At the time of sampling, cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted with QuickGene RNA cultured kit S (Fujifilm) on QuickGene-810 (Fujifilm) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quantity and quality were assessed with NanoDrop and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzers. DNase treatment was performed using DNase I (Sigma). cDNA synthesis was carried out using a SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) with 1 μg of RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The experiment was repeated independently two times in three replicates. For protein extraction, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7,5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, and Mini mixture protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). The whole procedure was performed on ice. Lysates were transferred to cooled microcentrifuge tubes, rotated for 10 min at 4 °C, and cold-centrifuged at 13,200 rpm. For transient transfection, Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) was used together with luciferase reporter constructs containing the Per1 promoter (19Travnickova-Bendova Z. Cermakian N. Reppert S.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Bimodal regulation of mPeriod promoters by CREB-dependent signaling and CLOCK/BMAL1 activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Antisense experiments reveal molecular details on mechanisms of ICER suppressing cAMP-inducible genes in rat pinealocytes.J. Pineal. Res. 2000; 29: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). On the 3rd day, cells were treated with 10 μm forskolin for different periods of time. For each treatment, eight replicates were performed. The medium was removed, and lysis buffer was applied (Promega). Luminescence was measured with a ONE-Glo kit (Promega) on a VICTOR X5 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For evaluation of transfection efficiency, cells were cotransfected with pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid as described (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar), and absorbance was measured using an Epoch spectrometer (BioTek). 5′-Cy5-labeled oligonucleotides (Eurogentec) for WT and mutant CREs in the Per1 promoter were used (Table 2). Single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed for 5 min at 95 °C and then left to cool slowly to room temperature for 3 h. The ICER protein was prepared with the TnT system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions with an Icer-His tag expression plasmid (a kind gift from Dr. M. S. Reitz) (22Barabitskaja O. Foulke Jr., J.S. Pati S. Bodor J. Reitz Jr., M.S. Suppression of MIP-1β transcription in human T cells is regulated by inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER).J. Leukoc. Biol. 2006; 79: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The binding reaction of ICER and oligonucleotides was carried out in the presence of binding buffer (200 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 500 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA), glycerol, DTT, MgCl2, and poly(dI/dC) at 37 °C for 20 min. Anti-His tag antibodies (Abcam ab9108) were added to the supershift reaction. Samples were separated on a polyacrylamide gel and scanned with a microarray scanner (Tecan) at 670 nm.TABLE 2Oligonucleotide sequences used for EMSANameOligonucleotide sequence (5′–3′)LabelmPer1_wt_fw_Cy5TCCGCTTTGACGTCACCTCCCTCy5mPer1_wt_rev_Cy5AGGGAGGTGACGTCAAAGCGGACy5mPer1_mut_fw_Cy5TCCGCTTTCACAAAACCTCCCTCy5mPer1_mut_rev_Cy5AGGGAGGTTTTGTGAAAGCGGACy5mPer1_wt_fwTCCGCTTTGACGTCACCTCCCTNonemPer1_wt_revAGGGAGGTGACGTCAAAGCGGANone Open table in a new tab To evaluate the role of CREM in the circadian clock, we compared expression profiles of selected core clock genes (Per1/2/3, Cry1/2, Bmal1, and Rev-erbα) between WT and KO mice (Fig. 1). The Period genes were chosen because of their inducibility by cAMP. We measured Cryptochrome because deletion of Cry1 and Cry2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts results in modified expression of genes from cholesterol synthesis (23Fink M. Španinger K. Prosenc U. Rozman D. High-fat medium and circadian transcription factors (CryptochromeClock) contribute to the regulation of cholesterogenic Cyp51Hmgcr genes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.Acta Chim. Slov. 2008; 55: 85-92Google Scholar). Bmal1 and Rev-erbα have also been linked previously to cholesterol metabolism, which is relevant for liver and adrenal glands (24Zmrzljak U.P. Rozman D. Circadian regulation of the hepatic endobiotic and xenobiotic detoxification pathways: the time matters.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2012; 25: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the liver, we observed only subtle changes in clock gene expression between wild-type and Crem KO mice, as shown in Fig. 1A with an overlay of fitted trigonometric functions. Two-way ANOVA between WT and KO samples suggested a statistically significant role for Crem in fine-tuning the circadian expression of Cry1 (p < 0.0001) and Per1 (p = 0.0405). Bootstrapping of experimental data (Fig. 2) suggested that deletion of Crem results in the phase advance of Cry1 and its lower amplitude in the liver, whereas it failed to detect changes in amplitude or phase for Per1. A more prominent role of Crem was observed in the adrenal gland (Fig. 1B); tuning of all measured clock genes could be observed. Bootstrapping analysis (Fig. 3) suggested that the absence of Crem influences the circadian phase: Per1 was phase-delayed, and Cry1 was phase-advanced. The effect of Crem KO on the Per1 and Cry1 amplitudes seemed less obvious. Overall, Crem influenced the phases and amplitudes of other circadian clock genes as well. The effect was stronger in the adrenal gland, where we observed changes in phases (Per and Cry) and amplitudes (Bmal1 and Rev-erbα) (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). The Crem gene has at least two functional promoters, leading to several transcripts that have not yet been investigated in a circadian context in the periphery. The internal P2 promoter of Crem is cAMP-inducible and leads to Icer transcription (Fig. 4A). Due to very low expression levels of Icer in the liver, it is difficult to assess the potential circadian profile (data not shown). On the other hand, Icer showed a circadian pattern with an expression peak at ZT 12 in the adrenal gland (Fig. 4B). Differences between the subjective day and the subjective night were detected also at the protein level, where more ICER was present in adrenal glands in the subjective night (Fig. 4C). Unfortunately, the Western blots could not be statistically evaluated because we pooled protein samples of several animals for each time point to obtain sufficient amounts of proteins. In the core clock gene screen (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3), Per1 was among the most affected genes in Crem KO samples. Both Icer (25Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Inducibility and negative autoregulation of CREM: an alternative promoter directs the expression of ICER, an early response repressor.Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) and Per1 (19Travnickova-Bendova Z. Cermakian N. Reppert S.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Bimodal regulation of mPeriod promoters by CREB-dependent signaling and CLOCK/BMAL1 activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7728-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) are inducible by cAMP in an immediate-early fashion. The mouse Period1 gene (Per1) promoter contains CREs that bind CREB from SCN protein extracts. CREB acts as a pivotal end point of signaling pathways for the regulation of mouse Per genes in the SCN. However, in the brain, the signaling-dependent activation of mouse Per genes is distinct from the CLOCK/BMAL1-driven transcription required within the clock feedback loop (19Travnickova-Bendova Z. Cermakian N. Reppert S.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Bimodal regulation of mPeriod promoters by CREB-dependent signaling and CLOCK/BMAL1 activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7728-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). To evaluate the response of Icer transcription to cAMP signaling, we tested the hepatic Hepa 1-6 and adrenal Y-1 cells. To our surprise, a 4-h forskolin treatment of Hepa 1-6 cells induced ICER protein expression more intensely than treatment of Y-1 cells (Fig. 5A). We used Hepa 1-6 cells in further experiments. Fig. 5B shows that forskolin induced Icer mRNA expression after 2 h, which is in line with the detected ICER protein (Fig. 5, A and C). The addition of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, resulted in elevated levels of Icer mRNA, whereas the addition of H-89, a protein kinase A inhibitor, repressed Icer mRNA synthesis (Fig. 5B). Similar conclusions could be reached for Per1: cycloheximide elevated expression of Per1, whereas H-89 led to diminishment (Fig. 5D). This suggests that de novo protein synthesis and phosphorylation by PKA contribute to cAMP-dependent immediate-early expression of Icer and Per1 in Hepa 1-6 cells. After this early wave of expression, forskolin provoked also the circadian expression of Per1 (Fig. 5E). According to current knowledge, ICER is the only cAMP-inducible transcription factor from the CREB/CREM/ATF family. It is a repressor of the cAMP-mediated early response that binds to CREs in promoter regions of cAMP-responsive genes (25Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Inducibility and negative autoregulation of CREM: an alternative promoter directs the expression of ICER, an early response repressor.Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The Per1 promoter contains several CREs that can bind CREB (19Travnickova-Bendova Z. Cermakian N. Reppert S.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Bimodal regulation of mPeriod promoters by CREB-dependent signaling and CLOCK/BMAL1 activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7728-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). CREB is a constitutively expressed transcription factor that is activated by phosphorylation upon cAMP stimuli and is involved in Per1 regulation in the pineal gland. We tested the hypothesis that fine-tuning Per1 on the periphery can be caused by the cAMP-inducible repressor ICER. Hepa 1-6 and Y-1 cells cotransfected with the Icer antisense plasmid and the Per1 promoter-reporter construct revealed an increased reporter activity in the presence of antisense Icer (Fig. 6A). Gel shift analysis with supershift and competition assay identified ICER as the protein that specifically binds th"
https://openalex.org/W2017565084,"The post-translational modifiers ubiquitin and small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) regulate numerous critical signaling pathways and are key to controlling the cellular fate of proteins in eukaryotes. The attachment of ubiquitin and SUMO involves distinct, but related, machinery. However, it is now apparent that many substrates can be modified by both ubiquitin and SUMO and that some regulatory interaction takes place between the respective attachment machinery. Here, we demonstrate that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ubiquitin ligase Rsp5p, a member of the highly conserved Nedd4 family of ubiquitin ligases, is SUMOylated in vivo. We further show that Rsp5p SUMOylation is mediated by the SUMO ligases Siz1p and Siz2p, members of the conserved family of PIAS SUMO ligases that are, in turn, substrates for Rsp5p-mediated ubiquitylation. Our experiments show that SUMOylated Rsp5p has reduced ubiquitin ligase activity, and similarly, ubiquitylated Siz1p demonstrates reduced SUMO ligase activity leading to respective changes in both ubiquitin-mediated sorting of the manganese transporter Smf1p and polySUMO chain formation. This reciprocal regulation of these highly conserved ligases represents an exciting and previously unidentified system of cross talk between the ubiquitin and SUMO systems."
