https://openalex.org/W1528089915,"The COOH terminus of the externally disposed variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of the eukaryotic pathogenic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei strain 427 variant MITat 1.4 (117) is covalently linked to a novel phosphatidylinositol-containing glycolipid. This conclusion is supported by analysis of the products of nitrous acid deamination or Staphylococcus aureus phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment of purified membrane-form VSG. Lysis of trypanosomes is accompanied by release of soluble VSG, catalyzed by activation of an endogenous phospholipase C. The only apparent difference between membrane-form VSG and soluble VSG is the removal of sn-1,2-dimyristylglycerol. The COOH-terminal glycopeptide derived by Pronase digestion of soluble VSG was characterized by chemical modification and digestion with alkaline phosphatase. The results are consistent with the single non-N-acetylated glucosamine residue being the reducing terminus of the oligosaccharide and in a glycosidic linkage to a myo-inositol monophosphate that is probably myo-inositol 1,2-cyclic monophosphate. A partial structure for the VSG COOH-terminal moiety is presented. This structure represents a new type of eukaryotic post-translational protein modification and membrane anchor. We discuss the relevance of this structure to observations that have been made with other eukaryotic membrane proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2049348188,"Canine parvovirus was first recognized during 1978. Analysis of isolates collected since its emergence revealed that viruses circulating after 1980 were antigenically different from earlier isolates. Monoclonal antibodies clearly distinguished the two strains, some being specific for either the old or the new viruses. Restriction enzyme analysis of viral DNA's showed that the post-1980 viruses were similar to earlier isolates, but some restriction site differences were present in the new strain. These results suggest that the canine parvoviruses infecting dogs in the seven areas of the United States that were sampled derive from a variant virus that replaced the original strain during 1980."
https://openalex.org/W2021410585,"Noninvasive angiography with magnetic resonance is demonstrated. Signal arising in all structures except vessels that carry pulsatile flow is eliminated by means of velocity-dependent phase contrast, electrocardiographic gating, and image subtraction. Background structures become in effect transparent, enabling the three-dimensional vascular tree to be imaged by projection to a two-dimensional image plane. Image acquisition and processing are accomplished with entirely conventional two-dimensional Fourier transform magnetic resonance imaging techniques. When imaged at 0.6 tesla, vessels 1 to 2 millimeters in diameter are routinely detected in a 50-centimeter field of view with data acquisition times less than 15 minutes. Studies of normal and pathologic anatomy are illustrated in human subjects."

https://openalex.org/W2078679477,"A database useful for mapping the human X chromosome has been established. The data consist of the genotypic characterizations obtained at more than 20 DNA marker loci from a set of 38 selected families. Multilocus linkage analysis has provided an initial genetic map completely spanning the distance from the distal short arm to the distal long arm of the chromosome, for a total genetic length of at least 185 recombination units. Analysis of the recombinational behavior of fully marked chromosomes suggests that the number of recombination events on the X chromosome may be nonrandom. Linkage studies of six families that carry the mutation which causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy were combined with linkage data from a large number of normal families. This permitted mapping of the locus for Duchenne muscular dystrophy with greater precision and statistical confidence than studies in which disease families alone provided the genotypic database. This observation suggests that the normal linkage map of this chromosome should be especially valuable in the mapping of rare X-linked diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1616375115,"The characteristics of the uptake by human epidermoid carcinoma (KB) cells of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate at extracellular concentrations in the physiologic range and the possible role of a membrane-associated folate binder in folate uptake by KB cells have been investigated. Uptake of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was specific, saturable, and time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent. Trypsin treatment released 50% of the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate accumulated by KB cells at 4 degrees C, but only 12% at 37 degrees C, indicating that most of the accumulated ligand was intracellular at 37 degrees C, thus demonstrating transport. Accumulated 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was bound to a membrane-associated protein which required detergent for its solubilization, and a significant amount of which was oriented to the cell exterior as demonstrated by its release by trypsin treatment of intact KB cells. The membrane-associated folate binder was immunoprecipitated by antiserum to purified human placental folate receptor, and this antiserum inhibited 5-methyltetrahydrofolate uptake by intact KB cells in a concentration-dependent manner. These data support the hypothesis that the membrane-associated folate-binding protein of human cells participates in the transport of folates under physiologic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1612353609,"A glycolipid antigen, detected by a monoclonal antibody (ME 311) obtained by immunizing mice with a human metastatic melanoma cell line (WM 46), was isolated and structurally characterized. Using immunostaining on thin-layer chromatograms for monitoring, 1.0 mg of a pure alkali-labile disialoganglioside was obtained from 23 g of packed melanoma cells (WM 164). Fractionation of the lipid extract was done on DEAE-Sepharose columns into total disialogangliosides which were repeatedly separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography. On mild alkaline treatment, the ganglioside was converted to a slower migrating species identical with a ganglioside GD3 isolated from the same source (Neu5Ac alpha 2—-8Neu5Ac alpha 2—-3Gal beta 1—-4Glc beta 1—-1-cer-amide) and specifically detected by monoclonal antibody R24. Comparison of the two gangliosides by fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry (revealing an acetyl group on the terminal sialic acid on the alkali-labile species) and by 1H NMR (indicating the position of the acetyl group) suggested the following structure: Neu5,9Ac2 alpha 2—-8Neu5Ac alpha 2—-3Gal beta 1—-4Glc beta 1—-1-ceramide. This is identical with a ganglioside proposed earlier to exist in melanoma cells (Cheresh, D. A., Varki, A. P., Varki, N. M., Stallcup, W. B., Levine, J., and Reisfeld, R. A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 7453-7459). Immunostaining with ME 311 antibody of cell extracts on thin-layer chromatography chromatograms revealed only this ganglioside in the melanoma cells, while normal human brain was negative. However, in one of the total ganglioside extracts tested for presence of binding with antibody ME 311, three gangliosides were found to bind. No evidence was obtained for the presence of the antigenic epitope in mucins or glycoproteins of the melanoma cells."

https://openalex.org/W1522964919,"A low molecular weight protein purified from rat liver cytosol was observed to bind heme with an affinity higher than that for other organic anions. Purification was achieved by two procedures, one employing affinity chromatography on oleic acid-agarose, and the other using sequential ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography after initial removal of aprotinin-sensitive proteases. Removal rather than inhibition of proteases improved the yield four times. Both procedures produced a stable protein. The purified protein binds heme with a higher affinity (Kd 0.15 microM) than any other organic anion tested including other (metallo)porphyrins, bilirubin, and oleic acid. Based on its molecular weight, amino acid composition, immunological properties, and the increase of its tissue levels in response to the administration of hypolipidemic agents, the protein was identified as being related to proteins of the Z class, whose members include fatty acid binding protein and sterol carrier protein. Like other Z proteins, our protein exhibits several forms on electrofocusing, but differs from fatty acid-binding protein and sterol carrier protein in that its major form exhibits a pI of 7.4. In view of its distinct isoelectric focusing pattern, its higher affinity for heme than for oleic acid, and its apparent inability to bind cholesterol and steroids, we cannot identify this protein as any of the above-mentioned proteins of the Z class. Consequently we have provisionally designated it heme-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1585270155,"Biosynthetically tritiated sterols from Chinese hamster lung (Dede) cells were fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography, and fractions were assayed for their ability to repress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in L cell cultures. Most of the activity found was associated with two oxysterols, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol. The identities of the two sterols were established by co-chromatography with authentic samples and by isotopic dilution and recrystallization. Only low levels of repressor activity were found in other fractions of the sterol extract. The endogenous concentrations of 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol (7.2 fg/cell) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (1.5 fg/cell) appear to be within the ranges required for the regulation of HMG-CoA reductase."

https://openalex.org/W1600996828,"Fe-salicylaldehyde isonicotinoylhydrazone (SIH), which can donate iron to reticulocytes without transferrin as a mediator, has been utilized to test the hypothesis that the rate of iron uptake from transferrin limits the rate of heme synthesis in erythroid cells. Reticulocytes take up 59Fe from [59Fe]SIH and incorporate it into heme to a much greater extent than from saturating concentrations of [59Fe]transferrin. Also, Fe-SIH stimulates [2-14C]glycine into heme when compared to the incorporation observed with saturating levels of Fe-transferrin. In addition, delta-aminolevulinic acid does not stimulate 59Fe incorporation into heme from either [59Fe]transferrin or [59Fe]SIH but does reverse the inhibition of 59Fe incorporation into heme caused by isoniazid, an inhibitor of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase. Taken together, these results suggest the hypothesis that some step(s) in the pathway of iron from extracellular transferrin to intracellular protoporphyrin limits the overall rate of heme synthesis in reticulocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1588660075,"Previously we have shown that the fluorescence of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist felodipine provides an accurate means of monitoring the formation of an allosterically potentiated conformer of calmodulin (Mills, J. S., and Johnson, J. D., (1985) Biochemistry 24, 4897-4903). Characteristic of this conformer is the abolition of cooperativity among the two felodipine-binding sites on calmodulin and a 20-fold increase in the apparent affinity of calmodulin for felodipine. In the present study, we find that the metal cations La3+, Tb3+, Pb2+, and Cd2+ are all capable of abolishing the cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2.0) among the two felodipine-binding sites on calmodulin and can increase the apparent affinity of calmodulin for felodipine by approximately 20-fold. These effects are seen either in the presence or absence of calcium and are half-maximal at 8, 12, 22, and 1000 microM, respectively. Zinc and H+ are capable of producing similar potentiations of felodipine binding (half-maximal at 570 microM, and pH 5.8), but only in the presence of calcium. In each case, the calcium-binding sites of calmodulin must be occupied (by calcium, La3+, Tb3+, Pb2+, or by Cd2+) before these metals can bind to sites which are distinct from the calcium-binding sites to produce the active conformer of calmodulin which exhibits enhanced affinity for felodipine. Mercury and copper can compete with these potentiating metal cations on calmodulin and produce an inactivation of this active calmodulin conformer. These studies suggest that some metals including La3+, Tb3+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Zn2+ and protons are capable of binding to a calcium-calmodulin complex and forming an allosterically active species of calmodulin which cannot be maintained by physiological concentrations of calcium ions alone. Mercury and copper, on the other hand, are capable of inactivating this active calmodulin conformer independent of the presence of calcium on calmodulin. These findings are examined in terms of the mechanism of action of calmodulin and its possible role in heavy metal toxicity."

https://openalex.org/W1536843146,"35S-Labeled adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) (10 ng/ml) was incubated with 1% Triton X-114 at various pH values varying from 3.0 to 8.0. The detergent phase was separated from the aqueous phase by centrifugation, and the amounts of Ad2 were determined in the two phases. At pH 7.0-8.0, less than 5% of Ad2 was associated with the detergent phase; at pH 5.0 or below, about 60% of Ad2 was associated with the detergent phase. When a mixture of 35S-labeled capsid proteins was used at pH 7.0, 60-70% of the total proteins were associated with the detergent at pH 5.0, but less than 5% of the proteins interacted with detergent at pH 7.0. Among the three major external proteins (hexon, penton base, and fiber), penton base had the highest association with Triton X-114 at pH 5.0. Both intact virus and the capsid proteins that were associated with Triton X-114 at pH 5.0 were released into the aqueous phase on subsequent incubation at pH 7.0. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that mildly acidic pH induces amphiphilic properties in adenovirus capsid proteins and may help Ad2 escape from acidic endocytic vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W1617283650,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a 16-kilobase pair (kb) region of DNA on the 5' side of the human embryonic globin gene (epsilon). This sequence, when combined with previously published sequences, gives an uninterrupted sequence of 21 kb extending from approximately 19.5 kb upstream of the epsilon-globin gene to 0.3 kb 3' to its poly(A)-addition site. Computer-assisted analysis of this DNA reveals no large regions of self-homology but it shows the presence of seven members of the Alu family of repeated DNA, two very short members of the Kpn family of repeated DNA, one unusual direct repeat of 39 base pairs, and two potential stem and loop structures. The overall frequencies of mono- and dinucleotides within the 21 kb approximate those found in the total human genome but the distribution of (G + C)-rich regions signal many sequences of interest. The occurrences of some of the polynucleotides and polydinucleotides also differ appreciably from randomness, and the region contains several large stretches of these simple sequences. We found no evidence of strand asymmetry in the region. Homology between the nucleotide sequences of the human epsilon- and G gamma-globin genes extends only 100 base pairs 5' to the genes. One region, about 10 kb upstream of the gene, shows an apparent clustering of unusual sequence features. We discuss our sequence data in relation to the studies by others of DNAase hypersensitive sites and 5' transcription endpoints in this part of the beta-globin gene cluster."
https://openalex.org/W1572291245,"We have studied putative nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the optic lobe of the newborn chick, using 125I-labeled alpha-bungarotoxin, a specific blocker of acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junction, and [3H]acetylcholine, a ligand which in the presence of atropine selectively labels binding sites of nicotinic character in rat brain cortex (Schwartz et al., 1982). [3H]Acetylcholine binds reversibly to a single class of high affinity binding sites (KD = 2.2 X 10(-8) M) which occur at a tissue concentration of 5.7 pmol/g. A large fraction (approximately 60%) of these binding sites is solubilized by Triton X-100, sodium cholate, or the zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate. Solubilization increases the affinity for acetylcholine and several nicotinic drugs from 1.5- to 7-fold. The acetylcholine-binding macromolecule resembles the receptor for alpha-bungarotoxin present in the same tissue with respect to subcellular distribution, hydrodynamic properties, lectin binding, and agonist affinity rank order. It differs from the toxin receptor in affinity for nicotinic antagonists, sensitivity to thermal inactivation, and regional distribution. The solubilized [3H]acetylcholine binding activity is separated from the toxin receptor by incubation with agarose-linked acetylcholine, by affinity chromatography on immobilized Naja naja siamensis alpha-toxin, and by precipitation with a monoclonal antibody to chick optic lobe toxin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1540594181,"Current evidence suggests that mitochondrial matrix enzymes exist in solid-state, multienzyme complexes in vivo. Addition of polyethylene glycol to a solution containing malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase generates such a solid-state, enzyme complex in vitro at enzyme concentrations permitting kinetic measurements. Suspensions of the isolated, solid-state, hetero-complex of these enzymes were used to study the coupled reactions of citrate synthesis from malate, NAD, and CoASAc. The particles appear to be about 1 microgram in diameter. Considering the ratio of enzyme to oxalacetate molecules in or at the surface of the solid-state particles, one would expect oxalacetate to be converted to citrate within a few molecular distances of the site of oxalacetate generation. This model of (or alternatively a direct transfer of oxalacetate between enzymes) is supported by experiments with excess aspartate aminotransferase and glutamate added to the solution phase to give a reaction competing with the synthase for bulk phase oxalacetate. Quantities of aminotransferase that reduce the citrate reaction rate with soluble dehydrogenase and synthase by 90% do not significantly affect rates with comparable amounts of the dehydrogenase-synthase complex. We suggest that similar substrate channeling can occur in vivo and discuss the possible advantages provided thereby."

https://openalex.org/W1485330394,"The subcellular localization of catecholamines and ascorbic acid in cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells was studied by permeabilizing the cells with digitonin, a steroid glycoside. Catecholamine release from permeabilized chromaffin cells was dependent on the free calcium concentration and the temperature of the incubation mixture. By contrast, [14C]ascorbic acid, preloaded into the cells, was released by digitonin treatment in a manner independent of the concentration of free calcium and with only moderate regard to the incubation temperature. The sensitivity of ascorbic acid release to digitonin treatment was identical to that of calcium-dependent catecholamine release. These results thus suggest that ascorbic acid preloaded into the cells may directly efflux from the cell cytoplasm as a result of the permeabilization of the plasma membrane. Dimethylepinephrine, a permanently positively charged catecholamine analog which is known to be excluded from vesicular fractions, was also released by digitonin treatment in a manner independent of calcium. The time course of dimethylepinephrine release was very similar to that of ascorbic acid release. Thus, newly accumulated ascorbic acid in chromaffin cells may be localized to a free pool in the cell cytoplasm rather than in a vesicular compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2093756231,"A hybrid gene containing the 5′ sequence of a hamster histone H3 gene and the coding sequence of the bacterial neomycin-resistance gene (neo) was constructed. Upon transfection into the hamster fibroblast cell line K12, the hybrid gene exhibited cell cycle-dependent regulation, as evidenced by the maximal accumulation of the neo transcripts during synthesis of DNA in the cell cycle. In addition, cells arrested in the prereplicative phase, as a consequence of the K12 temperature-sensitive mutation, produced significantly less neo messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1498025872,"The architecture of human complement component C9 and poly(C9) was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Monomeric native C9 (Mr = 66,000) exhibits an ellipsoid appearance (70 X 50 A) with a crevice visible on one face. C9 polymerizes spontaneously to form hollow tubular structures consisting of 12-16 monomeric subunits. Poly(C9) is a cylinder (150 A-outer diameters and 90 A-inner diameter) rimmed by a torus (46-A thick) on one end. Electron micrographs of poly(C9) indicate that the torus is formed by radial strands of polypeptide. Each subunit of poly(C9) is apparently tilted relative to the central axis of the cylindrical structure. C9 can be cleaved by alpha-thrombin into two single-chain polypeptide fragments: C9a (Mr = 28,000) and C9b (Mr = 38,000), which are the amino- and carboxyl-terminal segments of the protein, respectively. The cleaved form of the protein, C9a,b, can be induced to polymerize under suitable conditions to form sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant poly(C9), indicating that the resistance of poly(C9) to denaturation is a collective feature of both C9a and C9b. The C9a and C9b polypeptide regions have been mapped on poly(C9) by immunoelectron microscopy. Determinants for the C9a region were observed about the torus, base, and on the midsection of the poly(C9) cylinder. C9b epitopes are concentrated predominantly about the torus and base, but were rarely observed on the midsection of poly(C9). Thus, the C9a and C9b segments of the C9 polypeptide are not clearly segregated in poly(C9). The locations of oligosaccharide units on poly(C9) were visualized by electron microscopy after labeling of the complex with concanavalin A bound to colloidal gold. The oligosaccharide positions were found on the periphery of the torus and base. In summary, C9 appears to be a single-domain protein. Polymerization involves a major rearrangement. To form a subunit of poly(C9) the polypeptide chain must form at least one major fold parallel to the central axis of the tubule."
https://openalex.org/W1523927823,"Isoforms (derived from the same isoenzyme but distinguished by differences in isoelectric point) of MM creatine kinase appear in plasma after myocardial infarction. They are formed by conversion of the tissue form of creatine kinase (MM-A, pI 7.80) to progressively more acidic species (MM-B, pI 7.50) and MM-C (pI 7.20) after release into the circulation. To define the changes responsible for myocardial MM creatine kinase isoform formation in humans and dogs, purified isoforms were treated with trypsin or cyanogen bromide. The digests were fractionated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Comparison of proteolytic maps showed that MM-A and MM-C were each characterized by a single, unique peptide peak. Maps of MM-B creatine kinase contained both of these peaks. Sequence analysis and comparison with the complete amino acid sequence of MM creatine kinase showed that the peptide unique to MM-A corresponded to the COOH-terminal tryptic or CNBr peptide. The peptide unique to MM-C was shown to have the same amino acid composition except for lysine (the COOH-terminal amino acid). Thus, isoform formation is characterized by the successive removal of the COOH-terminal lysine residue from one M subunit at a time resulting in the conversion of MM-A to isoforms MM-B and MM-C."
https://openalex.org/W1574029385,"beta-Very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) may be a major atherogenic lipoprotein, and knowledge of the sites of its catabolism should facilitate elucidation of mechanisms important in the regulation of its plasma concentrations. In this study, catabolic sites of beta-VLDL have been delineated in normolipidemic rabbits with a novel, radioiodinated, residualizing label, 125I-dilactitol tyramine (125I-DLT). Comparative studies of beta-VLDL and low density lipoprotein catabolism were performed with 125I-DLT conjugated to each lipoprotein and with lipoproteins iodine-labeled conventionally. Conjugation did not alter size distributions or charge characteristics of lipoprotein particles. The overall processing (binding and degradation) of lipoproteins by cultured rabbit skin fibroblasts was not influenced by 125I-DLT derivatization, suggesting that attachment of the label did not influence cell receptor-lipoprotein interactions. Furthermore, although degradation products of 125I-lipoproteins leaked out of the cells and into the medium, the degradation products of 125I-DLT lipoproteins were retained by the cells. The principal catabolic site of beta-VLDL in normolipidemic rabbits was found to be the liver with 54 +/- 4% of injected 125I retained in this organ 24 h after injection of 125I-DLT-beta-VLDL. When catabolism was normalized to tissue weight, the liver and adrenals were found to be approximately equally active in the metabolism of beta-VLDL. In agreement with results of other studies with residualizing labels, the principal organ of catabolism of 125I-DLT-LDL in vivo was the liver. The adrenals were the most highly catabolizing organ when results were normalized for tissue weight. The quantitative differences observed in the tissue distributions of injected 125I-DLT-beta-VLDL and 125I-DLT-low density lipoprotein suggested that a significant proportion of beta-VLDL is removed by tissues before conversion to low density lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1585009116,"Formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase, a circular tetramer of dimers, binds four tetrahydropteroylpolyglutamates/octamer, which indicates that these polyglutamate sites are formed by one type of subunit interface. The transferase and deaminase are separate catalytic sites as determined by inhibition studies with (6R)-tetrahydropteroylglutamate and by the observation that the activities can operate simultaneously. Under conditions where the transferase is saturated with tetrahydropteroyl(glutamate)n substrate, exogenously added formimino intermediate is utilized by the deaminase only if at least one of the substrate/intermediate pair is a monoglutamate. These properties indicate the existence of only one polyglutamate site/pair of catalytic sites. Kinetic specificity for each activity as measured by Vm/Km increases for longer polyglutamates, but does not differentiate among 4, 5, 6, and 7 glutamates. The enzyme shows distinct preference for hexaglutamate based on Kd as well as on Km values. With all substrates, Vm of the deaminase is greater than that of the transferase, allowing for potential channeling of the intermediate between active sites. Efficiency of channeling, optimal with pentaglutamate, does not correspond with affinity for binding. This demonstrates that a steric requirement predominates over simple sequestering of intermediates on the enzyme surface as the fundamental mechanism for channeling."
https://openalex.org/W1598902103,"Abstract We have previously reported that the binding properties of the hemagglutinin (HA) of the WSN-F strain of influenza A are affected by the cells in which the virus is grown (Crecelius, D. M., Deom, C. M., and Schulze, I.T. (1984) Virology 139, 164-177); at 37 degrees C chick embryo fibroblast-grown F virus has a greater affinity for host cells than does the same virus grown in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. In an attempt to explain this host-determined property, we have characterized the carbohydrate put onto the viral HA by these two cells. Experiments using tunicamycin indicate that the HA made by MDBK cells contains about 4000 daltons of carbohydrate in excess of that on the HA from chick embryo fibroblast. Serial lectin affinity chromatography of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides on the HA subunits, HA1 and HA2, detected a number of host-dependent differences in the complex oligosaccharides. Both HA1 and HA2 from MDBK cells contained more highly branched (i.e. tri- and tetraantennary) complex oligosaccharides than did the subunits from chick embryo fibroblasts. In addition, the HA subunits from the two sources differed in the amount of galactose-containing bisected complex oligosaccharides and in the presence of certain fucosylated triantennary oligosaccharides. Profiles of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides from the host cells did not show these differences, indicating that the HA subunit profiles were not necessarily representative of the structures found on the cellular glycoproteins. The data support the conclusion that bulky oligosaccharides on the MDBK-HA subunits of WSN-F reduce the affinity of the virus for cellular receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1677406862,"Glycogen synthesis from various combinations of substrates by hepatocytes isolated from rats fasted 24 h was studied. As reported by Katz et al. (Katz, J., Golden, S., and Wals, P. A. (1976) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 73, 3433-3437), appreciable rates of glycogen synthesis occurred only in the presence of gluconeogenic precursors and one of several amino acids, which includes L-glutamine. L-Leucine had negligible effects on glycogen synthesis from 20 mM dihydroxyacetone and/or 15 mM glucose when L-glutamine was not added to the medium. In the presence of 10 mM L-glutamine, L-leucine greatly increased glycogen synthesis from these substrates. alpha-Ketoisocaproate was ineffective, as was oleate. NH4Cl depressed glycogen synthesis from 10 mM glucose plus 20 mM dihydroxyacetone in the absence of added L-glutamine and enhanced that in its presence, but these effects were weak compared to those of L-leucine. The amino acid analogues L-norvaline and L-norleucine exerted effects that were similar to those exerted by L-leucine. Under all conditions studied, cycloheximide and puromycin inhibited net glycogen synthesis. Cycloheximide did not stimulate gluconeogenesis from dihydroxyacetone, or phosphorylase in hepatocytes from starved rats, or glycogenolysis in hepatocytes from fed rats. Puromycin, however, stimulated glycogenolysis in hepatocytes from fed rats. Glycogen synthesis from 20 mM dihydroxyacetone proceeds with a pronounced initial lag phase that can be shortened by incubation of cells with glutamine plus leucine before addition of dihydroxyacetone. Concurrent measurements of glycogen synthesis, glycogen synthase, and gluconeogenesis under different conditions reveal that in addition to protein synthesis, activation of glycogen synthase, which must occur to allow glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes, requires a second component which can be satisfied by addition of dihydroxyacetone or fructose to the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1980978301,"The Dahl rat is used as a model of hypertension that is ""sensitive"" to dietary salt (sodium chloride, NaCl). When dietary salt is supplemented in the Dahl rat, the arterial blood pressure of the ""salt-sensitive"" strain (S) becomes much greater than that of the ""salt-resistant"" strain (R). It has been widely reported that arterial blood pressure of the young Dahl S rat is not greater than that of the young Dahl R rat before dietary salt is supplemented. In the present study, however, mean arterial pressure directly measured in unanesthetized, unrestrained S rats was greater than in R rats, both when they had been recently weaned and for at least 10 weeks thereafter, despite their having been fed a diet frankly deficient in salt. In weanling S rats, the ratio of heart weight to body weight was also significantly greater than that in weanling R rats, suggesting that the greater blood pressure in the S rat causes cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, biologic differences demonstrated between the S rat and the R rat after weaning, including the phenomenon of salt-sensitivity, could be a consequence of, or be dependent on, an already extant difference in arterial blood pressure between the two strains."

The fragment, identified by microsequence analysis, was discovered in a biologically active fraction of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). The fragment begins at position 117 in pro-IGF-II, two amino acids downstream from an Arg-Arg potential prohormone processing site. A synthetic analogue of the E-peptide at high concentrations stimulates [3H]thymidine incorporation in NIL8 hamster cells, raising the possibility that the E-peptide might bind with low affinity to a mitogen receptor. Peptides from the E-regions of pro-IGF-I and pro-IGF-II should be useful for development of radioimmunoassays for measurement of the somatic production of IGF-I and IGF-II, analogous to the radioimmunoassay for the insulin C-peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1591219300,"Abstract Clathrin, a Mr = 72,000 clathrin-associated protein, and myosin were purified in milligram quantities from the same erythrocyte hemolysate fraction. Erythrocyte clathrin closely resembled brain clathrin in several respects: (a) both are triskelions as visualized by electron microscopy with arms 40 nm in length with globular ends and a flexible hinge region in the middle of each arm, and these triskelions assemble into polyhedral cages at appropriate pH and ionic strength; (b) both molecules contain heavy chains of Mr = 170,000 that are indistinguishable by two-dimensional maps of 125I-labeled peptides; and (c) both molecules contain light chains of Mr approximately 40,000 in a 1:1 molar ratio with the heavy chain. Erythrocyte clathrin is not identical to brain clathrin since antibody raised against the erythrocyte protein reacts better with erythrocyte clathrin than with brain clathrin and since brain clathrin contains two light chains resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels while the light chain of erythrocyte clathrin migrates as a single band. The erythrocyte Mr = 72,000 clathrin-associated protein is closely related to a protein in brain that mediates ATP-dependent disassembly of clathrin from coated vesicles and binds tightly to clathrin triskelions (Schlossman, D. M., Schmid, S. L., Braell, W. A., and Rothman, J. E. (1984) J. Cell Biol. 99, 723-733). The erythrocyte and brain proteins have identical Mr on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and identical maps of 125I-labeled peptides, share antigenic sites, and bind tightly to ATP immobilized on agarose. Clathrin and the uncoating protein are not restricted to reticulocytes since equivalent amounts of these proteins are present in whole erythrocyte populations and reticulocyte-depleted erythrocytes. Clathrin is present at 6,000 triskelions/cells, while the uncoating protein is in substantial excess at 250,000 copies/cell."
https://openalex.org/W1564498991,"[1-3H]Allylamine was synthesized by sodium boro[3H]hydride reduction of acrolein followed by direct conversion of the [1-3H]allyl alcohol to N-allylphthalimide with triphenylphosphine, diethylazodicarboxylate, and phthalimide. The protecting group was removed with hydrazine. Inactivation of beef liver mitochondrial monoamine oxidase with [1-3H]allylamine led to incorporation of 1-6 eq of inactivator/active site depending upon the length of incubation time. Inactivation and radioactivity incorporation coincided; however, after 1 eq of tritium was incorporated and 5% enzyme activity remained, additional radioactivity continued to become incorporated into the enzyme. The optical spectrum of the FAD coenzyme changed during inactivation from that of oxidized to reduced flavin. Following dialysis of the inactivated enzyme, the spectrum remained reduced, but denaturation in urea rapidly resulted in reoxidation of the flavin. Under these same denaturing conditions, 96% of the radioactivity associated with the enzyme remained bound, therefore indicating that allylamine attachment is not to the flavin coenzyme but rather to an active site amino acid residue. The adduct also was stable to base and, to a lesser degree, acid treatment. Although allylamine and N-cyclopropylbenzylamine appear to be oxidized by monoamine oxidase to give 3-(amino acid residue) propanal adducts, two different amino acids seem to be involved because of a difference in stability of the adducts. The mechanisms for inactivation of monoamine oxidase by allylamine and reactivation by benzylamine are discussed in relation to previously reported results."
https://openalex.org/W1500500707,"The lipophilic carboxylic ionophores monensin and nigerisin reversibly blocked iron uptake by erythroid cells. At low concentrations of ionophores (0.25-0.5 microM), the disruption of the compartment in which iron is released affected minimally the release of iron from transferrin but effectively inhibited iron uptake. Iron released from transferrin was extruded from the cell synchronously with but not bound to transferrin. The compartment disrupted by the ionophores, and in which iron is released from transferrin, is apparently contiguous to the extracellular medium. Contiguity was assessed by determining the effect of extracellular Na+ and K+ on the activity of the ionophores. The above data fit a model of iron uptake in which iron is released from transferrin in an acidic compartment in immediate contiguity with the cell plasma membrane. Iron is then bound by its membrane acceptor and is translocated to the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane. At submicromolar concentrations, the ionophores monensin and nigerisin produce a small increase in the pH of the acidic compartment. The pH change, which is not sufficient to block the release of iron from transferrin, is enough to block the binding of released iron to its acceptor in the plasma membrane, thus producing inhibition of iron uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1572739220,"3,5,3'-Triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) regulates the growth rate and GH production of cultured GC cells, a rat pituitary tumor cell line. We have previously demonstrated a parallel increase in cellular content of DNA and nuclear T3 and glucocorticoid receptors during the DNA synthesis (S) phase of the GC cell growth cycle. To determine the relationship between the increase in nuclear hormone receptors and GH production in S-phase cultures, we measured the synthesis rate of GH by pulse-labeling with [3H]leucine and immunoprecipitation as well as the relative concentration of GH mRNA by dot hybridization employing formaldehyde-treated cytoplasm and GH cDNA. Total protein synthesis was similar in S-phase and asynchronous cultures. However, in comparison to asynchronous cultures, S-phase cells had an increased GH synthesis rate, p less than 0.005 (from 13,430 +/- 609 to 19,150 +/- 1160 cpm/10(6) cells/2 h) and increased GH mRNA, p less than 0.001 (from 7.2 +/- 1.2 to 14.5 +/- 1.5 relative A units). The S-phase-associated augmentation in GH production did not appear to result from a decrease in ADP-ribosylation induced by 2 mM thymidine treatment which was utilized for the S-phase synchronization. To determine whether increased GH mRNA and GH synthesis in S-phase was associated with an increase in synthesis of GH mRNA, we measured the incorporation of [3H]uridine into GH mRNA by incubating partially synchronized S-phase cells with [3H]uridine and isolating 3H-labeled GH mRNA by hybridization to GH cDNA immobilized on nitrocellulose filters. Total RNA synthesis was similar in asynchronous, S-phase and G1 cell populations. However, the mean incorporation of [3H]uridine into GH mRNA of S-phase cultures was decreased to 52, 59, and 61% (counts/min of GH mRNA/10(6) cells), 49, 59, and 65% (ppm of total RNA), and 64 and 69% (ppm of poly(A)+ RNA) of asynchronous cultures. Our studies show further that the decrease in [3H]uridine incorporation into GH mRNA did not result from a cell cycle specific change in efficiency of hybridization or exclusively to an S-phase associated increased rate of degradation of GH mRNA. Thus, despite increased nuclear T3 and glucocorticoid receptors and, increased GH mRNA and GH synthesis, the synthesis rate of GH mRNA appears decreased in S-phase GC cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1601550901,"Acanthamoeba actin is the only actin sequenced to date that has neither an NH2-terminal Ac-Asp nor Ac-Glu residue. The protein begins with an Ac-Gly-Asp and is coded for by a gene that specifies a polypeptide beginning Met-Gly-Asp. Thus, the Acanthamoeba actin gene would appear to specify a class II actin with the usual NH2-terminal Cys replaced with a Gly. Previous studies (Rubenstein, P. A., and Martin, D. J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11354-11360) revealed that for class II actins the Met is probably removed early in translation and the Cys is removed post-translationally as an Ac-Cys residue. Two possibilities might explain why Acanthamoeba actin is not processed in a similar fashion. Either Ac-Gly is not a substrate for the enzyme or the enzyme is absent from the organism. To test these alternatives, Acanthamoeba actin was labeled in vivo with [35S]methionine and incubated with processing enzyme from rat liver, rabbit reticulocytes, and Dictyostelium. In no case did the processing reaction occur, indicating that Ac-Gly is not recognized by the enzyme as a substrate. Furthermore, we could not reproducibly detect the presence of a processing enzyme in Acanthamoeba. We were, however, able to show the presence of such an enzyme in Dictyostelium, the first demonstration of this activity in a lower eukaryote."
https://openalex.org/W1542290549,"A binding method that detects only the strongest binding site for a ligand on a protein has been used to show that folates and folate analogs, conjugated with poly-gamma-glutamates, are bound to hemoglobin. When the concentration of hemoglobin is much larger than that of the polyglutamate, as is the case in the red cell, the fraction bound is a direct function of the hemoglobin concentration and is independent of the total polyglutamate concentration. Binding to deoxyhemoglobin tetramers is competitive with 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. In oxyhemoglobin the folyl and methotrexate polyglutamates are bound preferentially by free alpha beta dimers, but removal of the pteridine moiety leads to tetramer binding even in oxyhemoglobin. Changes in the length of the polyglutamate side chain and alterations of the pteridine structure such as reduction and/or methylation have a much larger effect on the constant for binding to deoxyhemoglobin tetramers than on that for oxyhemoglobin dimers. The implications of these results for the storage of pteroylpolyglutamates in the erythrocyte and their release from the red cell under the influence of the degree of oxygenation and variations in the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate level are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1550781458,"Incubation of a highly purified fraction derived from rat liver Golgi apparatus with [gamma-32P]ATP results in phosphorylation of several endogenous phosphoproteins. One phosphoprotein with an apparent Mr of 48,300 is radiolabeled to an apparent extent at least 5-fold higher than any other phosphoprotein as part of either the Golgi apparatus or highly purified rat liver fractions derived from the rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, plasma membrane, coated vesicles, cytosol, and total homogenate. Approximately 70% of the 48.3-kDa phosphoprotein appears to be a specific extrinsic Golgi membrane protein with the phosphorylated amino acid being threonine. The protein kinase which phosphorylates the 48.3-kDa protein is an intrinsic Golgi membrane protein and is dependent on Mg2+, independent of Ca2+, calmodulin, and cAMP, and is inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide. Preliminary evidence suggests that there are also intrinsic membrane protein kinases in the Golgi apparatus which are dependent on Ca2+ and cAMP. The physiological role of the above phosphoproteins and protein kinases is not known."

https://openalex.org/W1556091693,"The fish, Fundulus heteroclitus (L.), like most advanced teleosts, possesses duplicate loci for the glycolytic enzyme, glucose-phosphate isomerase (D-glucose-6-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.9). The locus for the GPI-A2 (where GPI represents glucose-phosphate isomerase) isozyme is preferentially expressed in anaerobic tissues such as white skeletal muscle, while GPI-B2 predominates in aerobic tissues like liver and red muscle. We questioned whether this tissue specificity would be reflected in unique structural and functional characteristics of the respective isozymes. Consequently, an analysis of the two isozymes was undertaken. The enzymes were purified by a combination of ion-exchange chromatography and isoelectric focusing. Each isozyme was characterized as to native and subunit molecular weight, isoelectric pH, and susceptibility to thermal denaturation. Both were dimeric enzymes, with native molecular masses of 110 kDa. The isoelectric pH values for GPI-A2 and GPI-B2 were 7.9 and 6.4, respectively. Differences were apparent in thermal stability, i.e. GPI-A2 was more stable than GPI-B2. Kinetic properties were investigated as a function of both pH and temperature. The Km values for fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) differed between the isozymes at low pH, but no significant differences were observed at higher pH. The inhibition constant (Ki) for 6-phosphogluconate (6-P-gluconate) was pH dependent. GPI-A2 was slightly more sensitive to 6-P-gluconate inhibition than GPI-B2 between pH 7.0 and 8.5. The Km for Fru-6-P was temperature dependent for the GPI-B2 isozyme, but relatively temperature independent for GPI-A2 between 10 and 35 degrees C. The Ki for 6-P-gluconate was temperature dependent for both isozymes. The Ki values for GPI-A2 were consistently lower than those for GPI-B2. Energies of activation differed between the two isozymes by 4.4 kcal with GPI-A2 having the lower value. While delta G values were identical for the isozymes, their delta H and delta S values differed significantly. The structural and kinetic differences that exist between the glucose-phosphate isomerase isozymes appear to be tailored to the unique metabolic demands of the tissues in which these Gpi loci are expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1592666567,"The distribution of glucuronic and iduronic acid within the chains of anticoagulantly active and inactive beef lung heparin was investigated. A fraction with an average molecular weight of 19,500 was isolated from the heterodisperse mixture and then separated into active and inactive components by affinity chromatography. Each sample was linked through its reducing terminus to tyramine, reduced with sodium borotritide, and bound covalently to Sepharose via an azo bridge. The bound reduced heparin was treated with a limited amount of HNO2 and the degraded fragments were removed. The sections of the chain contiguous with the original reducing terminus were then detached from the insoluble matrix by reaction with sodium dithionite. The recovered polysaccharide was fractionated according to size on Sephadex G-200 and the amount of each uronic acid in the individual fractions was determined. Inactive heparin showed a constant percentage of glucuronic acid in all fragments, i.e. about 8.9% of the total uronic acid. With active heparin the percentage of glucuronic acid increased with the distance from the reducing terminus of the polysaccharide chain, ranging from 9.5 to 20% of the uronic acids. These results suggest that the biosynthesis of active heparin involves unique reactions or specific processing of the macromolecule."
https://openalex.org/W1538057801,"The origin of and relationships among multiple forms of the estrogen receptor from rat uteri were investigated using electrophoretic and conventional hydrodynamic methods of analysis. Evidence is presented that the molybdate-stabilized, multimeric receptor (Stokes radius approximately 70A; S20,w approximately 9.5 S; Mr approximately 290,000) corresponds to an acidic form of the receptor that has relatively high electrophoretic mobility. This discrete form, which appears to represent the untransformed state that does not bind to DNA, was converted to a number of derived forms by exposure to conditions that result in receptor transformation and/or subunit dissociation. In crude cytosol, transformation always generated receptor forms that were excluded from polyacrylamide gels, and it was shown that these are large heterogeneous aggregates. This explains previous failed attempts to analyze the receptor by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Transformation of partially purified, molybdate-stabilized receptor never led to aggregate formation, but resulted instead in the generation of two relatively basic estrogen-binding species of low electrophoretic mobility. These components may represent the free or dissociated estrogen-binding subunits. Together, the results suggest a model for the molybdate-stabilized receptor wherein at least one of its components is an acidic, nonestrogen-binding subunit."
