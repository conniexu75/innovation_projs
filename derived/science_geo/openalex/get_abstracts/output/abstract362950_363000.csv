https://openalex.org/W1999746344,"There is growing recognition that mammalian cells produce many thousands of large intergenic transcripts. However, the functional significance of these transcripts has been particularly controversial. Although there are some well-characterized examples, most (>95%) show little evidence of evolutionary conservation and have been suggested to represent transcriptional noise. Here we report a new approach to identifying large non-coding RNAs using chromatin-state maps to discover discrete transcriptional units intervening known protein-coding loci. Our approach identified approximately 1,600 large multi-exonic RNAs across four mouse cell types. In sharp contrast to previous collections, these large intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) show strong purifying selection in their genomic loci, exonic sequences and promoter regions, with greater than 95% showing clear evolutionary conservation. We also developed a functional genomics approach that assigns putative functions to each lincRNA, demonstrating a diverse range of roles for lincRNAs in processes from embryonic stem cell pluripotency to cell proliferation. We obtained independent functional validation for the predictions for over 100 lincRNAs, using cell-based assays. In particular, we demonstrate that specific lincRNAs are transcriptionally regulated by key transcription factors in these processes such as p53, NFkappaB, Sox2, Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) and Nanog. Together, these results define a unique collection of functional lincRNAs that are highly conserved and implicated in diverse biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2049718632,"The molecular mechanism by which a mechanical stimulus is translated into a chemical response in biological systems is still unclear. We show that mechanical stretching of single cytoplasmic proteins can activate binding of other molecules. We used magnetic tweezers, total internal reflection fluorescence, and atomic force microscopy to investigate the effect of force on the interaction between talin, a protein that links liganded membrane integrins to the cytoskeleton, and vinculin, a focal adhesion protein that is activated by talin binding, leading to reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Application of physiologically relevant forces caused stretching of single talin rods that exposed cryptic binding sites for vinculin. Thus in the talin-vinculin system, molecular mechanotransduction can occur by protein binding after exposure of buried binding sites in the talin-vinculin system. Such protein stretching may be a more general mechanism for force transduction."

With the identification of the gap junction protein occludin as the fourth and final key component of the hepatitis C virus cell-entry receptor, that elusive lab model may have come a step nearer. In addition to human occludin, viral infection of murine cells requires expression of the previously identified HCV entry factors CD81, scavenger receptor class B type I, and claudin-1. This report identifies the gap junction protein occludin as the fourth and final key component of the hepatitis C virus cell-entry receptor, paving the way towards the development of a small animal model for hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of liver disease worldwide. The development of much needed specific antiviral therapies and an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of a convenient small animal model. The determinants restricting HCV tropism to human and chimpanzee hosts are unknown. Replication of the viral RNA has been demonstrated in mouse cells1,2, but these cells are not infectable with either lentiviral particles bearing HCV glycoproteins (HCVpp)3 or HCV produced in cell culture (HCVcc) (A.P., M.E. and C.M.R., unpublished observations), suggesting that there is a block at the level of entry. Here we show, using an iterative complementary DNA library screening approach, that human occludin (OCLN) is an essential HCV cell entry factor that is able to render murine cells infectable with HCVpp. Similarly, OCLN is required for the HCV-susceptibility of human cells, because its overexpression in uninfectable cells specifically enhanced HCVpp uptake, whereas its silencing in permissive cells impaired both HCVpp and HCVcc infection. In addition to OCLN, HCVpp infection of murine cells required expression of the previously identified HCV entry factors CD81 (ref. 4), scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI, also known as SCARB1)5 and claudin-1 (CLDN1)6. Although the mouse versions of SR-BI and CLDN1 function at least as well as the human proteins in promoting HCV entry, both OCLN and CD81 must be of human origin to allow efficient infection. The species-specific determinants of OCLN were mapped to its second extracellular loop. The identification of OCLN as a new HCV entry factor further highlights the importance of the tight junction complex in the viral entry process, and provides an important advance towards efforts to develop small animal models for HCV."
https://openalex.org/W2080935386,"In the course of infection or autoimmunity, particular transcription factors orchestrate the differentiation of T(H)1, T(H)2 or T(H)17 effector cells, the responses of which are limited by a distinct lineage of suppressive regulatory T cells (T(reg)). T(reg) cell differentiation and function are guided by the transcription factor Foxp3, and their deficiency due to mutations in Foxp3 results in aggressive fatal autoimmune disease associated with sharply augmented T(H)1 and T(H)2 cytokine production. Recent studies suggested that Foxp3 regulates the bulk of the Foxp3-dependent transcriptional program indirectly through a set of transcriptional regulators serving as direct Foxp3 targets. Here we show that in mouse T(reg) cells, high amounts of interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4), a transcription factor essential for T(H)2 effector cell differentiation, is dependent on Foxp3 expression. We proposed that IRF4 expression endows T(reg) cells with the ability to suppress T(H)2 responses. Indeed, ablation of a conditional Irf4 allele in T(reg) cells resulted in selective dysregulation of T(H)2 responses, IL4-dependent immunoglobulin isotype production, and tissue lesions with pronounced plasma cell infiltration, in contrast to the mononuclear-cell-dominated pathology typical of mice lacking T(reg) cells. Our results indicate that T(reg) cells use components of the transcriptional machinery, promoting a particular type of effector CD4(+) T cell differentiation, to efficiently restrain the corresponding type of the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1999765951,"The cytoskeleton, integrin-mediated adhesion, and substrate stiffness control a common set of cell functions required for development and homeostasis that are often deranged in cancer. The connection between these mechanical elements and chemical signaling processes is not known. Here, we show that α 5 β 1 integrin switches between relaxed and tensioned states in response to myosin II–generated cytoskeletal force. Force combines with extracellular matrix stiffness to generate tension that triggers the integrin switch. This switch directly controls the α 5 β 1 -fibronectin bond strength through engaging the synergy site in fibronectin and is required to generate signals through phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. In the context of tissues, this integrin switch connects cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix mechanics to adhesion-dependent motility and signaling pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2091218020,"According to the prevailing view, high-affinity T-cell receptor (TCR) ligation is required for T-cell priming and thymic negative selection, while low-affinity ligands induce positive selection and lymphopaenia-driven homeostatic expansion. Zehn et al. report that, surprisingly, T-cell expansion after initial activation occurs irrespective of TCR affinity. Low-affinity cells generate functional effector and memory responses. However, their expansion ceases earlier resulting in an overall decreased total number of low-affinity cells compared to their high-affinity counterparts. The findings have implications for autoimmunity and the makeup of the memory T-cell pool. This paper reports the observation that T-cell expansion after initial activation occurs irrespective of TCR affinity. Low-affinity cells generate functional effector and memory responses; however, their expansion ceases earlier, resulting in an overall decreased total number of low-affinity cells compared to their high-affinity counterparts. After an infection, T cells that carry the CD8 marker are activated and undergo a characteristic kinetic sequence of rapid expansion, subsequent contraction and formation of memory cells1,2,3. The pool of naive T-cell clones is diverse and contains cells bearing T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs) that differ in their affinity for the same antigen4,5. How these differences in affinity affect the function and the response kinetics of individual T-cell clones was previously unknown. Here we show that during the in vivo response to microbial infection, even very weak TCR–ligand interactions are sufficient to activate naive T cells, induce rapid initial proliferation and generate effector and memory cells. The strength of the TCR–ligand interaction critically affects when expansion stops, when the cells exit lymphoid organs and when contraction begins; that is, strongly stimulated T cells contract and exit lymphoid organs later than weakly stimulated cells. Our data challenge the prevailing view that strong TCR ligation is a prerequisite for CD8+ T-cell activation. Instead, very weak interactions are sufficient for activation, but strong TCR ligation is required to sustain T-cell expansion. We propose that in response to microbial challenge, T-cell clones with a broad range of avidities for foreign ligands are initially recruited, and that the pool of T cells subsequently matures in affinity owing to the more prolonged expansion of high-affinity T-cell clones."
https://openalex.org/W2070015044,"It has been proposed that during embryonic development haematopoietic cells arise from a mesodermal progenitor with both endothelial and haematopoietic potential called the haemangioblast. A conflicting theory instead associates the first haematopoietic cells with a phenotypically differentiated endothelial cell that has haematopoietic potential (that is, a haemogenic endothelium). Support for the haemangioblast concept was initially provided by the identification during mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation of a clonal precursor, the blast colony-forming cell (BL-CFC), which gives rise to blast colonies with both endothelial and haematopoietic components. Although recent studies have now provided evidence for the presence of this bipotential precursor in vivo, the precise mechanism for generation of haematopoietic cells from the haemangioblast still remains completely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the haemangioblast generates haematopoietic cells through the formation of a haemogenic endothelium intermediate, providing the first direct link between these two precursor populations. The cell population containing the haemogenic endothelium is transiently generated during BL-CFC development. This cell population is also present in gastrulating mouse embryos and generates haematopoietic cells on further culture. At the molecular level, we demonstrate that the transcription factor Tal1 (also known as Scl; ref. 10) is indispensable for the establishment of this haemogenic endothelium population whereas the core binding factor Runx1 (also known as AML1; ref. 11) is critical for generation of definitive haematopoietic cells from haemogenic endothelium. Together our results merge the two a priori conflicting theories on the origin of haematopoietic development into a single linear developmental process."
https://openalex.org/W2014414194,"Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that synthesizes telomere repeats in tissue progenitor cells and cancer cells. Active human telomerase consists of at least three principal subunits, including the telomerase reverse transcriptase, the telomerase RNA (TERC), and dyskerin. Here, we identify a holoenzyme subunit, TCAB1 (telomerase Cajal body protein 1), that is notably enriched in Cajal bodies, nuclear sites of RNP processing that are important for telomerase function. TCAB1 associates with active telomerase enzyme, established telomerase components, and small Cajal body RNAs that are involved in modifying splicing RNAs. Depletion of TCAB1 by using RNA interference prevents TERC from associating with Cajal bodies, disrupts telomerase-telomere association, and abrogates telomere synthesis by telomerase. Thus, TCAB1 controls telomerase trafficking and is required for telomere synthesis in human cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2014062656,"Desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria , show extreme phenotypic plasticity, transforming between a little-seen solitarious phase and the notorious swarming gregarious phase depending on population density. An essential tipping point in the process of swarm formation is the initial switch from strong mutual aversion in solitarious locusts to coherent group formation and greater activity in gregarious locusts. We show here that serotonin, an evolutionarily conserved mediator of neuronal plasticity, is responsible for this behavioral transformation, being both necessary if behavioral gregarization is to occur and sufficient to induce it. Our data demonstrate a neurochemical mechanism linking interactions between individuals to large-scale changes in population structure and the onset of mass migration."
https://openalex.org/W2075364878,"Genetic incompatibilities resulting from interactions between two loci represent a potential source of postzygotic barriers and may be an important factor in evolution when they impair the outcome of interspecific crosses. We show that, in crosses between strains of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, loci interact epistatically, controlling a recessive embryo lethality. This interaction is explained by divergent evolution occurring among paralogs of an essential duplicate gene, for which the functional copy is not located at the same locus in different accessions. These paralogs demonstrate genetic heterogeneity in their respective evolutionary trajectories, which results in widespread incompatibility among strains. Our data suggest that these passive mechanisms, gene duplication and extinction, could represent an important source of genetic incompatibilities across all taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2106125134,"Small metal nanoparticles that are also highly crystalline have the potential for showing enhanced catalytic activity. We describe the preparation of single nanocrystals of platinum that are 2 to 3 nanometers in diameter. These particles were generated and immobilized on spherical polyelectrolyte brushes consisting of a polystyrene core (diameter of ∼100 nanometers) onto which long chains of a cationic polyelectrolyte were affixed. In a first step, a nanoalloy of gold and platinum (a solid solution) was generated within the layer of cationic polyelectrolyte chains. In a second step, the gold was slowly and selectively dissolved by cyanide ions in the presence of oxygen. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, wide-angle x-ray scattering, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy showed that the resulting platinum nanoparticles are faceted single crystals that remain embedded in the polyelectrolyte-chain layer. The composite systems of the core particles and the platinum single nanocrystals exhibit an excellent colloidal stability, as well as high catalytic activity in hydrogenation reactions in the aqueous phase."
https://openalex.org/W2087078667,"Stem cells are widely seen as the mechanism that permits organ regeneration in both plants and animals. In the plant root system, the stem cell niche has been assumed to be a local pattern organizer, required for both continuous post-embryonic growth and regeneration. New work in a root-tip regeneration system now shows that the root stem cell niche is in fact not necessary for pattern formation and re-establishment of cell identity, thus separating the functions of growth and repatterning. When the Arabidopsis root tip is cut off, taking with it the stem cell niche, the plant's remaining cells are able to regenerate all the major tissues that make up the root tip. This finding suggests that there are as yet unknown mechanisms that coordinate organogenesis independently of a central organizer. In the plant root system it is thought that the stem cell niche is a local pattern 'organizer' required for both continuous post-embryonic growth and regeneration. Here, the root stem cell niche is shown to be not necessary for pattern formation and re-establishment of cell identity, separating growth from re-patterning. Plants rely on the maintenance of stem cell niches at their apices for the continuous growth of roots and shoots. However, although the developmental plasticity of plant cells has been demonstrated1, it is not known whether the stem cell niche is required for organogenesis. Here we explore the capacity of a broad range of differentiating cells to regenerate an organ without the activity of a stem cell niche. Using a root-tip regeneration system in Arabidopsis thaliana to track the molecular and functional recovery of cell fates, we show that re-specification of lost cell identities begins within hours of excision and that the function of specialized cells is restored within one day. Critically, regeneration proceeds in plants with mutations that fail to maintain the stem cell niche. These results show that stem-cell-like properties that mediate complete organ regeneration are dispersed in plant meristems and are not restricted to niches, which nonetheless seem to be necessary for indeterminate growth. This regenerative reprogramming of an entire organ without transition to a stereotypical stem cell environment has intriguing parallels to recent reports of induced transdifferentiation of specific cell types in the adult organs of animals2,3."
https://openalex.org/W1986156047,"Single-molecule force spectroscopy allows superb mechanical control of protein conformation. We used a custom-built low-drift atomic force microscope to observe mechanically induced conformational equilibrium fluctuations of single molecules of the eukaryotic calcium-dependent signal transducer calmodulin (CaM). From this data, the ligand dependence of the full energy landscape can be reconstructed. We find that calcium ions affect the folding kinetics of the individual CaM domains, whereas target peptides stabilize the already folded structure. Single-molecule data of full length CaM reveal that a wasp venom peptide binds noncooperatively to CaM with 2:1 stoichiometry, whereas a target enzyme peptide binds cooperatively with 1:1 stoichiometry. If mechanical load is applied directly to the target peptide, real-time binding/unbinding transitions can be observed."
https://openalex.org/W2000129128,"Schwann cells develop from multipotent neural crest cells and form myelin sheaths around axons that allow rapid transmission of action potentials. Neuregulin signaling through the ErbB receptor regulates Schwann cell development; however, the downstream pathways are not fully defined. We find that mice lacking calcineurin B1 in the neural crest have defects in Schwann cell differentiation and myelination. Neuregulin addition to Schwann cell precursors initiates an increase in cytoplasmic Ca 2+ , which activates calcineurin and the downstream transcription factors NFATc3 and c4. Purification of NFAT protein complexes shows that Sox10 is an NFAT nuclear partner and synergizes with NFATc4 to activate Krox20 , which regulates genes necessary for myelination. Our studies demonstrate that calcineurin and NFAT are essential for neuregulin and ErbB signaling, neural crest diversification, and differentiation of Schwann cells."
https://openalex.org/W2098094939,"ADP ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) plays a critical role in regulating secretory traffic and membrane transport within the Golgi of eukaryotic cells. Arf1 is activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (ArfGEFs), which confer spatial and temporal specificity to vesicular transport. We describe here the discovery and characterization of golgicide A, a potent, highly specific, reversible inhibitor of the cis-Golgi ArfGEF GBF1. Inhibition of GBF1 function resulted in rapid dissociation of COPI vesicle coat from Golgi membranes and subsequent disassembly of the Golgi and trans-Golgi network. Secretion of soluble and membrane-associated proteins was arrested at the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment, whereas endocytosis and recycling of transferrin were unaffected by GBF1 inhibition. Internalized shiga toxin was arrested within the endocytic compartment and was unable to reach the dispersed trans-Golgi network. Collectively, these results highlight the central role for GBF1 in coordinating bidirectional transport and maintaining structural integrity of the Golgi."
https://openalex.org/W2017849755,"Microbial symbioses are essential for the normal development and growth of animals. Often, symbionts must be acquired from the environment during each generation, and identification of the relevant symbiotic partner against a myriad of unwanted relationships is a formidable task. Although examples of this specificity are well-documented, the genetic mechanisms governing it are poorly characterized. Here we show that the two-component sensor kinase RscS is necessary and sufficient for conferring efficient colonization of Euprymna scolopes squid by bioluminescent Vibrio fischeri from the North Pacific Ocean. In the squid symbiont V. fischeri ES114, RscS controls light-organ colonization by inducing the Syp exopolysaccharide, a mediator of biofilm formation during initial infection. A genome-level comparison revealed that rscS, although present in squid symbionts, is absent from the fish symbiont V. fischeri MJ11. We found that heterologous expression of RscS in strain MJ11 conferred the ability to colonize E. scolopes in a manner comparable to that of natural squid isolates. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses support an important role for rscS in the evolution of the squid symbiosis. Our results demonstrate that a regulatory gene can alter the host range of animal-associated bacteria. We show that, by encoding a regulator and not an effector that interacts directly with the host, a single gene can contribute to the evolution of host specificity by switching 'on' pre-existing capabilities for interaction with animal tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2105673253,"Major depression is more prevalent in women than in men. The underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not well understood, but recent data shows that hippocampal volume reductions in depressed women occur only when depression is preceded by an early life stressor. This underlines the potential importance of early life stress, at least in women, for the vulnerability to develop depression. Perinatal stress exposure in rodents affects critical periods of brain development that persistently alter structural, emotional and neuroendocrine parameters in adult offspring. Moreover, stress inhibits adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a form of structural plasticity that has been implicated a.o. in antidepressant action and is highly abundant early postnatally. We here tested the hypothesis that early life stress differentially affects hippocampal structural plasticity in female versus male offspring.We show that 24 h of maternal deprivation (MD) at PND3 affects hippocampal structural plasticity at PND21 in a sex-dependent manner. Neurogenesis was significantly increased in male but decreased in female offspring after MD. Since no other structural changes were found in granule cell layer volume, newborn cell survival or proliferation rate, astrocyte number or gliogenesis, this indicates that MD elicits specific changes in subsets of differentiating cells and differentially affects immature neurons. The MD induced sex-specific effects on neurogenesis cannot be explained by differences in maternal care.Our data shows that early environment has a critical influence on establishing sex differences in neural plasticity and supports the concept that the setpoint for neurogenesis may be determined during perinatal life. It is tempting to speculate that a reduced level of neurogenesis, secondary to early stress exposure, may contribute to maladaptation of the HPA axis and possibly to the increased vulnerability of women to stress-related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2142340251,"Social and psychological factors interact with genetic predisposition and dietary habit in determining obesity. However, relatively few pre-clinical studies address the role of psychosocial factors in metabolic disorders. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated in male mice: 1) opposite status-dependent effect on body weight gain under chronic psychosocial stress; 2) a reduction in body weight in individually housed (Ind) male mice. In the present study these observations were extended to provide a comprehensive characterization of the metabolic consequences of chronic psychosocial stress and individual housing in adult CD-1 male mice. Results confirmed that in mice fed standard diet, dominant (Dom) and Ind had a negative energy balance while subordinate (Sub) had a positive energy balance. Locomotor activity was depressed in Sub and enhanced in Dom. Hyperphagia emerged for Dom and Sub and hypophagia for Ind. Dom also showed a consistent decrease of visceral fat pads weight as well as increased norepinephrine concentration and smaller adipocytes diameter in the perigonadal fat pad. On the contrary, under high fat diet Sub and, surprisingly, Ind showed higher while Dom showed lower vulnerability to obesity associated with hyperphagia. In conclusion, we demonstrated that social status under chronic stress and individual housing deeply affect mice metabolic functions in different, sometime opposite, directions. Food intake, the hedonic response to palatable food as well as the locomotor activity and the sympathetic activation within the adipose fat pads all represent causal factors explaining the different metabolic alterations observed. Overall this study demonstrates that pre-clinical animal models offer a suitable tool for the investigation of the metabolic consequences of chronic stress exposure and associated psychopathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2021938691,"Membrane proteins that transport hydrophobic compounds have important roles in multi-drug resistance and can cause a number of diseases, underscoring the importance of protein-mediated transport of hydrophobic compounds. Hydrophobic compounds readily partition into regular membrane lipid bilayers, and their transport through an aqueous protein channel is energetically unfavourable. Alternative transport models involving acquisition from the lipid bilayer by lateral diffusion have been proposed for hydrophobic substrates. So far, all transport proteins for which a lateral diffusion mechanism has been proposed function as efflux pumps. Here we present the first example of a lateral diffusion mechanism for the uptake of hydrophobic substrates by the Escherichia coli outer membrane long-chain fatty acid transporter FadL. A FadL mutant in which a lateral opening in the barrel wall is constricted, but which is otherwise structurally identical to wild-type FadL, does not transport substrates. A crystal structure of FadL from Pseudomonas aeruginosa shows that the opening in the wall of the beta-barrel is conserved and delineates a long, hydrophobic tunnel that could mediate substrate passage from the extracellular environment, through the polar lipopolysaccharide layer and, by means of the lateral opening in the barrel wall, into the lipid bilayer from where the substrate can diffuse into the periplasm. Because FadL homologues are found in pathogenic and biodegrading bacteria, our results have implications for combating bacterial infections and bioremediating xenobiotics in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2065907989,"Background We have shown previously that exercise benefits stress resistance and stress coping capabilities. Furthermore, we reported recently that epigenetic changes related to gene transcription are involved in memory formation of stressful events. In view of the enhanced coping capabilities in exercised subjects we investigated epigenetic, gene expression and behavioral changes in 4-weeks voluntarily exercised rats. Methodology/Principal Findings Exercised and control rats coped differently when exposed to a novel environment. Whereas the control rats explored the new cage for the complete 30-min period, exercised animals only did so during the first 15 min after which they returned to sleeping or resting behavior. Both groups of animals showed similar behavioral responses in the initial forced swim session. When re-tested 24 h later however the exercised rats showed significantly more immobility behavior and less struggling and swimming. If rats were killed at 2 h after novelty or the initial swim test, i.e. at the peak of histone H3 phospho-acetylation and c-Fos induction, then the exercised rats showed a significantly higher number of dentate granule neurons expressing the histone modifications and immediate-early gene induction. Conclusions/Significance Thus, irrespective of the behavioral response in the novel cage or initial forced swim session, the impact of the event at the dentate gyrus level was greater in exercised rats than in control animals. Furthermore, in view of our concept that the neuronal response in the dentate gyrus after forced swimming is involved in memory formation of the stressful event, the observations in exercised rats of enhanced neuronal responses as well as higher immobility responses in the re-test are consistent with the reportedly improved cognitive performance in these animals. Thus, improved stress coping in exercised subjects seems to involve enhanced cognitive capabilities possibly resulting from distinct epigenetic mechanisms in dentate gyrus neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2067937627,"Polarization of cell division is essential for eukaryotic development, but little is known about how this is accomplished in plants. The formation of stomatal complexes in maize involves the polarization of asymmetric subsidiary mother cell (SMC) divisions toward the adjacent guard mother cell (GMC), apparently under the influence of a GMC-derived signal. We found that the maize pan1 gene promotes the premitotic polarization of SMCs and encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein that becomes localized in SMCs at sites of GMC contact. PAN1 has an inactive kinase domain but is required for the accumulation of a membrane-associated phosphoprotein, suggesting a function for PAN1 in signal transduction. Our findings implicate PAN1 in the transmission of an extrinsic signal that polarizes asymmetric SMC divisions toward GMCs."
https://openalex.org/W2048004251,"Hypoxia is important in a wide range of biological processes, such as animal hibernation and cell survival, and is particularly relevant in many diseases. The sensitivity of cells and organisms to hypoxic injury varies widely, but the molecular basis for this variation is incompletely understood. Using forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans , we isolated a hypoxia-resistant reduction-of-function mutant of rrt-1 that encodes an arginyl–transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase, an enzyme essential for protein translation. Knockdown of rrt-1 , and of most other genes encoding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, rescued animals from hypoxia-induced death, and the level of hypoxia resistance was inversely correlated with translation rate. The unfolded protein response was induced by hypoxia and was required for the hypoxia resistance of the reduction-of-function mutant of rrt-1 . Thus, translational suppression produces hypoxia resistance, in part by reducing unfolded protein toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1979076855,"Mood disorders affect the lives and functioning of millions each year. Epidemiological studies indicate that childhood trauma is predominantly associated with higher rates of both mood and anxiety disorders. Exposure of rats to stress during juvenility (JS) (27–29 days of age) has comparable effects and was suggested as a model of induced predisposition for these disorders. The importance of the environment in the regulation of brain, behavior and physiology has long been recognized in biological, social and medical sciences. Here, we studied the effects of JS on emotional and cognitive aspects of depressive-like behavior in adulthood, on Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity and on the expression of cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1-CAM). Furthermore, we combined it with the examination of potential reversibility by enriched environment (EE) of JS – induced disturbances of emotional and cognitive aspects of behavior in adulthood. Three groups were tested: Juvenile Stress –subjected to Juvenile stress; Enriched Environment – subjected to Juvenile stress and then, from day 30 on to EE; and Naïves. In adulthood, coping and stress responses were examined using the elevated plus-maze, open field, novel setting exploration and two way shuttle avoidance learning. We found that, JS rats showed anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in adulthood, altered HPA axis activity and altered L1-CAM expression. Increased expression of L1-CAM was evident among JS rats in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and Thalamus (TL). Furthermore, we found that EE could reverse most of the effects of Juvenile stress, both at the behavioral, endocrine and at the biochemical levels. The interaction between JS and EE resulted in an increased expression of L1-CAM in dorsal cornu ammonis (CA) area 1 (dCA1)."

Chem. 1991; 266: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lin T. Kim P.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5282-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), whereas that of the oxidizing periplasmic protein E. coli DsbA is -120 mV (8Zapun A. Bardwell J.C. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin fold proteins that participate in a wide range of thiol disulfide exchange reactions, such as the eukaryotic protein-disulfide isomerases, have intermediate redox potentials (around -160 mV (9Appenzeller-Herzog C. Ellgaard L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar)). Thioredoxin-related proteins provide an attractive model for the study of how protein function is dictated by sequence and three-dimensional structure; this is because their functions are, in part, determined by their redox properties, which in turn, are easy to quantify. For example, mutations in thioredoxin that make its redox potential more oxidative complement null mutations in the oxidase DsbA (10Jonda S. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Mössner E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3271-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Quan S. Schneider I. Pan J. Von Hacht A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28823-28833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of how thioredoxin fold sequence affects redox properties provides an excellent opportunity to relate sequence and function. Previous work has focused on the role of the CXXC “redox rheostat” active site in determining the properties of thioredoxin-related proteins (3Pan J. Bardwell J.C. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2217-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Mössner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Folding Des. 1998; 3: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Experiments that exchange the X-X dipeptide of one thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase with that of another generally result in an oxidoreductase with a redox potential partially shifted in the direction of the oxidoreductase protein that served as the source of the dipeptide (3Pan J. Bardwell J.C. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2217-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Mössner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R.

Although the X-X dipeptide is important, it is not the only feature that influences thioredoxin fold protein function. Another extremely well conserved but much less studied region of thioredoxin-like proteins is the loop containing a cis-proline, which closely approaches the CXXC motif (5Gruber C. Cemazar M. Heras B. Martin J.L. Craik D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 455-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Biophysical studies of E. coli thioredoxin and DsbA indicate that the conserved cis-proline residue plays a significant role in the stability and structure of these proteins (16Georgescu R. Li J.H. Goldberg M.E. Tasayco M.L. Chaffotte A.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10286-10297Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Charbonnier J. Belin P. Moutiez M. Stura E.A. Quéméneur E. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Other studies have identified additional interesting roles for the cis-proline loop. For example, mutation in E. coli DsbA of the cis-proline residue causes accumulation of mixed disulfide intermediates with substrates in vivo (18Kadokura H. Tian H. Zander T. Bardwell J.C. Beckwith J. Science. 2004; 303: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), suggesting that the cis-proline plays a role in substrate release. Furthermore, studies on human thioredoxin revealed that its cis-proline prevents metal binding by the active site thiolates (19Su D. Berndt C. Fomenko D.E. Holmgren A. Gladyshev V.N. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6903-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Structural evidence from both thioredoxin and DsbA indicates that the cis-proline loop is involved in substrate binding (20Maeda K. Hägglund P. Finnie C. Svensson B. Henriksen A. Structure (Lond.). 2006; 14: 1701-1710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21Inaba K. Murakami S. Suzuki M. Nakagawa A. Yamashita E. Okada K. Ito K. Cell. 2006; 127: 789-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 22Dai S. Friemann R. Glauser D.A. Bourquin F. Manieri W. Schürmann P. Eklund H. Nature. 2007; 448: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Finally, mutations in the residue just N-terminal to the cis-proline (the cisPro-minus1 residue) in DsbG give rise to variants that gained DsbC-like isomerase activity (23Hiniker A. Ren G. Heras B. Zheng Y. Laurinec S. Jobson R.W. Stuckey J.A. Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11670-11675Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The side chain of the cisPro-minus1 residue is usually within 4 Å of the reactive N-terminal cysteine of the CXXC motif, giving this residue the potential to be involved in hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the nucleophilic cysteine and thereby to modulate its activity (see Fig. 1). To investigate the role of the cisPro-minus1 residue, this study tests the effect of mutations on the activities and redox properties of thioredoxin fold proteins. We examined four divergent members of the thioredoxin family: E. coli DsbA, a strong oxidase; E. coli thioredoxin, which is relatively reducing; E. coli DsbC a protein-disulfide isomerase; and E. coli DsbG, a thioredoxin-related protein with redox properties similar to those of the isomerase DsbC but with no known in vivo substrates. The results show that the cisPro-minus1 residue is universally important in determining the redox properties of thioredoxin fold proteins. It also seems to be crucial in regulating the ability of these proteins to interact with both upstream and downstream substrates. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in the study are listed in supplemental Table S1. Plasmid construction, site-directed mutagenesis, protein purification, reduction, oxidation, concentration determination, and sequence alignment are described in the supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Redox Potential Measurement-The redox potentials of wild type (WT) DsbA, DsbG, DsbC, and their mutants and the thioredoxin mutants CPHC and I75T/CPHC were measured by incubation in degassed redox buffers containing various concentrations of GSH/GSSG, as described by Bessette et al. (24Bessette P. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The redox potentials of thioredoxin and other mutants were determined by redox equilibria with cDsbD, mainly as described by Collet et al. (25Collet J. Riemer J. Bader M.W. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26886-26892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The redox potential of cDsbD (-241 mV) was used as a standard. Determination of pKa Values-To determine the pH-dependent ionization of the nucleophilic cysteine, we recorded the specific absorbance of the thiolate anion at 240 nm (26Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We also monitored the pH-dependent absorbance of the oxidized form as a reference. Measurements were carried out at 25 °C in a buffer consisting of 10 mm K2HPO4, 10 mm boric acid, 10 mm sodium succinate, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 mm KCl, pH 7.5, for DsbA, DsbC, DsbG, and mutants, with an average initial protein concentration of 20 μm. The pH of the protein solution was lowered to 2.2 by the stepwise addition of aliquots of 0.2 m HCl. Absorbances at 240 and 280 nm were recorded on a Cary 50BIO UV-visible spectrophotometer and corrected for the volume increase. For thioredoxin and thioredoxin mutants, measurements were carried out at 25 °C in a buffer consisting of 10 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm sodium borate, pH 8.5. The pH of the protein solution was lowered to 3 by the stepwise addition of aliquots of 0.2 m HCl. Absorbances at 240 and 280 nm were recorded on a Cary 100BIO UV-visible spectrophotometer and corrected for the pH decrease and volume increase. All buffers were degassed, and purged with nitrogen before experiments. The pH dependence of the thiolate-specific absorbance signal (S = (A240/A280)reduced/(A240/A280)oxidized) was fit according to the Henderson-Hasselbach equation. Reductase Activity Assay-The ability of DsbA, DsbG, thioredoxin, DsbC, and variants to catalyze the reduction of human insulin in the presence of DTT was tested essentially as described by Holmgren (27Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A stock solution of 872 μm insulin was freshly prepared in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 2 mm EDTA before each assay. The reaction mixtures were prepared directly in cuvettes using 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.33 mm DTT with 5 μm enzyme in a final volume of 0.8 ml. The reactions were started by adding insulin to a final concentration of 131 μm. After thorough mixing, the cuvettes were placed in the spectrophotometer, and measurements were performed at 650 nm for 120 min. In all experiments, the uncatalyzed reduction of insulin by DTT was monitored in a control reaction without the addition of thioredoxin-related oxidoreductases. The ability of thioredoxin and variants to catalyze the reduction of human insulin in the presence of thioredoxin reductase and NADPH was tested as described by Lundström and Holmgren (28Lundström J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9114-9120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were prepared directly in cuvettes using 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.1 μm thioredoxin reductase, 5 μm thioredoxin, and variants in a final volume of 0.8 ml. The reactions were started by adding insulin to a final concentration of 100 μm. Oxidase Activity Assay-The oxidative folding of hirudin was tested essentially as described by Quan et al. (11Quan S. Schneider I. Pan J. Von Hacht A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28823-28833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In brief, oxidase activity was determined by the rate at which oxidized DsbA, DsbG, thioredoxin, or their variants donate a disulfide bond to reduced hirudin. The fluorescence excitation at 295 nm increases when oxidized DsbA, DsbG, or thioredoxin loses its active site disulfide bond; however, hirudin itself shows no fluorescence change during the reaction. The assay was performed on a KinTek SF-2004 stop flow instrument in single-mixing mode. The traces consisted of a minimum of three to five successive stop flow experiments, and the data for each trace were fit individually to a single exponential equation to obtain the pseudo first-order rate constant Kobs. Averaged Kobs values were plotted against the hirudin concentration. The slope is the observed second-order rate constant of the reaction, which indicates the oxidase activity. Isomerase Activity Assay with Scrambled Hirudin as a Substrate-Scrambled hirudin refolding was tested essentially as described by Hiniker et al. (23Hiniker A. Ren G. Heras B. Zheng Y. Laurinec S. Jobson R.W. Stuckey J.A. Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11670-11675Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hirudin samples were diluted to 24 μm and incubated with or without 24 μm reduced DsbA, DsbG, thioredoxin, or their variants in 100 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. Folding reactions were quenched by addition of 10% (v/v) formic acid following incubation at room temperature at various time points. The reaction products were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a Vydac™218TP54 C18 column at 55 °C using an acetonitrile gradient (19-25%, 30 ml) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The eluted proteins were detected by their absorbance at 220 nm. Refolding of Scrambled RNase A-To determine the in vitro isomerase activity of DsbA V150T and DsbC T182V, we also utilized the scrambled RNase A refolding assay. Reduced denatured RNase A (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 6 m GdmCl for at least 3 days in the dark at room temperature to prepare scrambled RNase A (29Hillson D.A. Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The randomly reoxidized RNase A was concentrated, and after acidifying the solution, the oxidation of disulfide bonds was confirmed using Ellman’s assay. Reshuffling of scrambled RNase A (40 μm) was carried out by incubation in 100 mm phosphoric acid-NaOH, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, with 10 μm oxidized DsbC, DsbCT182V, DsbA, or DsbA V150T (DsbA, DsbC, and mutants were oxidized with 1.7 mm copper(II)[1,10-phenanthroline]). The reactions were started by the addition of DTT to a final concentration of 10 μm. As a positive control, we carried out an additional reaction using folded RNase A without any thioredoxin fold protein. The assay was performed at 25 °C, and samples were taken at several time points and assayed for RNase A activity by monitoring cCMP hydrolysis spectrophotometrically at 296 nm for 2.5 min. The fraction of native RNase A (%) was plotted against incubation time. Kinetics of DsbA V150T Interaction with DsbB-Oxidation of reduced DsbA and variants by DsbB and Q1 was tested according to Tapley et al. (30Tapley T. Eichner T. Gleiter S. Ballou D.P. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10263-10271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, a typical reaction contained 100 μm freshly reduced DsbA or V150T, 10 μm DsbB, and 200 μm ubiquinone-1 (coenzyme Q1, Sigma). DsbA and a DsbB/coenzyme Q1 mixture were incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.04% dodecyl maltoside, pH 8.0, at 25 °C before mixing. The absorbance after mixing was recorded at 510 nm. One data set contained three to five successive injections, and data for each trace were analyzed separately. The resulting data were further fit using SigmaPlot and the Michaelis-Menten equation to give Km and kcat values. Spot Titers for Cadmium Resistance and Copper Resistance-Spot titers for cadmium resistance were performed to quantify the relative oxidase activity of DsbA and variants in vivo. Spot titers for copper resistance were performed to quantify the relative reductase activity caused by mutations in thioredoxin in vivo. Briefly, strains were grown overnight in LB-ampicillin (200 mg/ml) and diluted 1:100 into fresh LB-ampicillin (200 mg/ml). Strains were grown to mid-logarithmic phase at 37 °C and serially diluted into 150 mm NaCl. 2 μl of each dilution was plated onto LB-ampicillin plates (200 mg/ml) with 40 μm cadmium (for oxidase assay) or TB plates with 17 mm CuCl2 (for reductase assay) as described previously (23Hiniker A. Ren G. Heras B. Zheng Y. Laurinec S. Jobson R.W. Stuckey J.A. Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11670-11675Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Hiniker A. Collet J.F. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33785-33791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); cells were grown at 37 °C overnight. All spot titers were performed in duplicate or triplicate. 4-Acetoamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene2,2′-disulfonicacid(AMS) Trapping-Strains were grown overnight in LB-ampicillin (200 mg/ml) and diluted 1:100 into fresh LB-ampicillin (200 mg/ml). Strains were grown to mid-logarithmic phase at 37 °C, and DsbA or mutant protein were expressed by induction using 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 10 min. Cells were acid-precipitated overnight equivalent to 0.5 OD units. Acid-precipitated proteins were solubilized in buffered SDS solution containing 10 mg/ml AMS. The samples were incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 1 h. Alkylation was stopped by the addition of reducing SDS loading buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis and Western blotting. Protein Structure Determination-Purified thioredoxin I75T (15 mg/ml) was crystallized using sitting-drop vapor diffusion. Crystals were grown in 30% polyethylene glycol 8000, 150 mm sodium acetate, and 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5. The crystals belong to the C2 space group with unit cell dimensions of a = 58.8 Å, b = 39.4 Å, c = 90.6 Å, and β = 96.6°. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit. A 2.0 Å resolution data set was collected using X-rays generated by a Rigaku rotating anode x-ray generator. The structure was solved by molecular replacement as implemented in the CNS program (32Brünger A. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) using the WT E. coli thioredoxin structure as a search model (2TRX). The model was initially refined using the CNS program (32Brünger A. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) with rebuilding in O (33Jones T. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) followed by refinement with Refmac5 (34Murshudov G. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13869) Google Scholar) from CCP4 suite (35Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar) and finally in Phenix (36Adams P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3643) Google Scholar). TLS parameters were incorporated during the refinement process. Each thioredoxin molecule in the asymmetric unit was defined as one TLS group. The final model has a working R-factor of 25.1% and a free R-factor of 29.0%. The modest R-factors are largely because the crystal used in data collection was slightly twinned. Data collection and structure refinement statistics are shown in supplemental Table S3. The cisPro-minus1 Residue Regulates the Redox Potential of Thioredoxin Fold Proteins-Sequence alignment of the various subfamilies of thioredoxin fold proteins revealed that the cis-Pro-minus1 residue tends to be conserved within each subfamily but differs between different subfamilies (Table 1). Isoleucine is common in thioredoxins, threonine is common in the prokaryotic disulfide isomerases DsbC and DsbG, and valine is common in DsbA and glutaredoxins. Given this pattern of conservation, the close proximity in three-dimensional space of this residue to the active site (see Fig. 1) and the existence of gain and loss of function mutations that affected this cisProminus1 residue in DsbG (23Hiniker A. Ren G. Heras B. Zheng Y. Laurinec S. Jobson R.W. Stuckey J.A. Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11670-11675Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we were intrigued by the possibility that the character of the cisPro-minus1 residue helps to determine the divergent properties of the various subfamilies of thioredoxin fold proteins. Thus, DsbA, DsbC, DsbG, and thioredoxin cisPro-minus1 mutants (Table 2) were constructed on the basis of the simple principle of exchanging the side chain common to one subfamily with that present in another subfamily. For example, the cisPro-minus1 residue in the oxidase DsbA is nearly always valine; this was exchanged with threonine, the residue most commonly found in the isomerases DsbC and DsbG, to generate the variant DsbA V150T.TABLE 1Sequence of the CXXC motif and cisPro loop Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Parameters for DsbA, DsbG, thioredoxin, DsbC, and their variantsProteinRedox potentialpKaReductaseOxidaseIsomerasemVA−1 min−2 μm−1μm−1S−1DsbA−120 ± 23.3 ± 0.11.74 ± 0.06 × 10−41.76 ± 0.12++++V150T−92 ± 13.5 ± 0.10.13 ± 0.01 × 10−42.20 ± 0.014++DsbG−127 ± 23.5 ± 0.1<0.01 × 10−40.0043 ± 0.0004−T200L−178 ± 4N.D.0.22 ± 0.01 × 10−40.0043 ± 0.0004+T200MaParameters for DsbG T200M are from Hiniker et al.

A. 2007; 104: 11670-11675Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab The redox potentials of the mutant proteins were measured (Table 2, supplemental Fig. S1). When threonine replaces the hydrophobic valine or isoleucine residue at the cisPro-minus1 position, the redox potential is substantially increased. Thus threonine exerts a more oxidizing influence than valine. For the DsbA V150T mutant, for instance, the equilibrium constant with glutathione is 1.0 × 10-5 m. This translates to an intrinsic redox potential (Eo′) of -92 mV. DsbA V150T is thus substantially more oxidizing than WT DsbA, Keq = 8.67 × 10-5 m, Eo′=-120 mV, making it as oxidizing as DsbL (37Grimshaw J.P. Stirmann C.U. Brozzo M.S. Malojcic G. Grütter M.G. Capitani G. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 667-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the most oxidizing disulfide catalyst known. In contrast, when a hydrophobic side chain replaces the more hydrophilic threonine, as in the DsbG T200L, DsbG T200M, or DsbC T182V mutants, the redox potential of proteins is substantially decreased. Thus a hydrophobic residue at the cisPro-minus1 position exerts a reducing influence on the protein (Table 2). To further explore the effects of side chain substitutions at the cisPro-minus1 position, we examined the effect of altering this residue in thioredoxin (Ile-75) to all other possible amino acid side chains. We characterized the mutants in vivo and in vitro, as shown in supplemental Table S2 and Fig. 2. All substitutions at the Ile-75 position alter the redox potential of the thioredoxin (Fig. 2A). Every substitution made thioredoxin more oxidizing, consistent with the idea that evolution has maximized the reducing power of thioredoxin. These results show that the cisPro-minus1 residue has a very strong influence on the redox properties of thioredoxin proteins. Surprisingly, these changes in redox potential are very similar in magnitude to those within the active site CXXC motif of thioredoxin, suggesting that the cisPro-minus1 residue in thioredoxin fold proteins has just as important a role in determining the redox potential of these proteins as the comprehensively studied CXXC residues (3Pan J. Bardwell J.C. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2217-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Quan S. Schneider I. Pan J. Von Hacht A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In contrast, substitutions in the residue just C-terminal to the cis-proline (the cisPro-plus1 position) had very little effect on the redox properties of various thioredoxin fold proteins (data not shown), leading to the conclusion that this residue is not important in determining the redox properties of these proteins. The crystal structures of thioredoxin fold proteins show that the cis-proline loop and the X-X dipeptide interact with the active site cysteines from opposite directions (Fig. 1), raising the possibility that they exert their influence independently of each other. To explore this question, we combined two of the most oxidizing thioredoxin mutations: the cisPro-minus1 I75T mutation (Table 2) with the CPHC DsbA-like active site sequence mutation (11Quan S. Schneider I. Pan J. Von Hacht A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28823-28833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) to generate the double mutant. The double mutant has a redox potential of -180 mV, 91 mV more oxidizing than the wild type and thus by far the most oxidizing thioredoxin mutant that we know. Significantly, the increase in the redox potential in the double mutant of 91 mV is almost additive of the increases conferred by the individual mutations, I75T (45 mV, Table 2) and CPHC (42 mV from supplemental Fig S1C or 60 mV using the value from Ref. 10Jonda S.

These results raise the interesting possibility that the majority of the redox properties of thioredoxin fold proteins are determined by a very small number of residues. To further"

Among its various distinguishing features is a long (∼630 amino acids) N-terminal cytosolic tail containing six domains that are individually folded and capable of binding one copper(I) ion each. We expressed the entire tail as a single construct in Escherichia coli and investigated its interaction with its copper chaperone (i.e. HAH1) by solution NMR spectroscopy. We observed that all six of the metal-binding domains were metallated by Cu(I)-HAH1, with the first, the second, and the fourth domains forming an adduct with it. This behavior is different from that of the highly similar human ATPase ATP7A, in which only two domains form such an adduct. The distinct behaviors of the different domains were analyzed in terms of the energetics of Cu(I) transfer, hinting at a specific role of the interaction with copper(I)-HAH1 in the overall functional process.

Human ATP7B is a P1B-type ATPase that, like the other human copper(I)-transporting ATPase, ATP7A, can translocate copper(I) to the trans-Golgi network, where the metal is incorporated into copper-dependent enzymes. Copper stimulation results in the redistribution of both ATP7A and ATP7B to the plasma membrane through intracellular vesicles in order to export excess copper out of the cytosol (1Petris M.J.

All the six MBDs of the N-terminal tail of MNK are metallated by the metallochaperone. Additionally, two of them form, at relatively high levels, an intermolecular copper(I)-bridged adduct with HAH1 (28Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Della Malva N. Migliardi M. Rosato A. J. Biol.

In this work, we investigated the interaction of copper(I)-HAH1 with the whole N-terminal tail of WLN to characterize the different behavior of its six MBDs metal-binding domains and compare it to the properties of the N-terminal tail of MNK. The variations between these two systems may be relevant for the details of their different functioning in tissues where both proteins are expressed (such as kidney and placenta). The features of the interactions of the MBDs of P1B-type ATPases with their partners are rationalized on the basis of a specific energetic profile of the copper transfer reaction. Preparation of Protein Samples-A DNA segment corresponding to residues 1–633 of WLN (WLN1-6 hereafter) was amplified by PCR and cloned in the Gateway Entry vector pENTR/TEV/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) to include the tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site at the N-terminal end. This segment was then subcloned into the pETG-20A EMBL (36Alzari P.M. Berglund H. Berrow N.S. Blagova E. Busso D. Cambillau C. Campanacci V. Christodoulou E. Eiler S. Fogg M.J. Folkers G. Geerlof A.

Mutants were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Wild type and mutant WLN1-6 were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3) cells (Novagen) in minimal medium cultures and purified using HisTrap chelating FF columns (GE Healthcare). For isotope enrichment, (15NH4)2SO4 and 13C-labeled glucose were used. The His tag and the fusion protein were cleaved with AcTEV (Invitrogen). Protein purity was checked by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectra. Copper(I) was added to samples in an inert atmosphere chamber (Coy Lab) by adding an acetonitrile solution of tetrakis(acetonitrile)copper(I) hexafluorophosphate as copper source in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol. All samples contained around 0.3 mm protein in 50 mm phosphate, 50 mm arginine, 50 mm glutamate at pH 7.0. The addition of arginine and glutamate to the buffer extended the lifetime of the samples (37Golovanov A.P. Hautbergue G.M. Wilson S.A. Lian L.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8933-8939Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), which, however, remained in the range of 2–3 days. HAH1 samples were prepared as already reported, always without a poly-His tag (38Anastassopoulou J. Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Katsari E. Rosato A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13046-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In titration experiments, we added copper(I)-HAH1 and apo-WLN1-6 directly in the NMR tube under N2 atmosphere, using the same procedure previously followed for MNK1-6 (28Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Della Malva N. Migliardi M. Rosato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23140-23146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy-NMR experiments were acquired using Bruker Avance spectrometers operating at proton frequencies of 500, 700, and 900 MHz, all equipped with cryogenically cooled probes. Resonance assignments of WLN1-6 were performed through conventional multidimensional NMR techniques based on triple resonance experiments (39Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 478-528Google Scholar). Titrations of apo-WLN1-6 with copper(I)-HAH1 were followed through 1H-15N SOFAST-heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence experiments (40Schanda P. Kupce E. Brutscher B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 33: 199-211Google Scholar). The backbone dynamics of copper(I)-HAH1 in the presence of apo-WLN1-6 was investigated through the analysis of 15N R1, R2 relaxation rates (41Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). More than one sample was needed to complete NMR data collection. A table summarizing the NMR experiments performed is given in the supplemental material (Table S1). All of the figures reporting NMR spectra were generated with the program CARA (42Keller R. The Computer Aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial. CANTINA Verlag, Goldau, Switzerland2004Google Scholar). The first 633 amino acids of WLN (WLN1-6, with the wild-type sequence), comprising the entire cytosolic tail and in particular the six MBDs, were expressed in E. coli as a single construct; the protein could be enriched in the 15N and 13C stable isotopes, permitting its characterization by NMR spectroscopy. Protein solubility was only about 300 μm at pH 7.0; in addition, the samples were poorly stable, displaying significant degradation after 2–3 days. Fig. S1 reports a two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of apo-WLN1-6. The particularly favorable line widths of the spectra are due to the presence of long linker segments between the various domains, which allow them to tumble regardless of one another. We assigned signals from all six MBDs using triple resonance experiments; the backbone resonance assignments both for the apo and copper(I) forms are reported in Tables S2 and S3. In the other regions of the polypeptide chain, we could observe and assign some signals from the linker connecting domains 1 and 2, domains 3 and 4, and domains 5 and 6. The present assignment was more extensive than that achieved for MNK1-6 (28Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Della Malva N. Migliardi M. Rosato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23140-23146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Using a labile inorganic copper(I) complex, we could fully metallate the protein. The HSQC spectra of metallated WLN1-6 were used to readily identify metal transfer from copper(I)-HAH1 to the various MBDs during titrations of apo-WLN1-6 with HAH1 (see below). As mentioned, the major focus of this work was on the analysis of the interaction between apo-WLN1-6 and copper(I)-HAH1. This was investigated by adding the latter to WLN1-6, with only one of the two proteins enriched in 15N so that only its signals appeared in 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The samples contained 1 mm dithiothreitol. The interaction with copper(I)-HAH1 caused a variation of the chemical shifts of the signals from the backbone amide moieties of domains 1, 2, and 4 (Fig. 1), whose magnitude increased upon increasing concentration of the titrant. Instead, for domains 3, 5, and 6, we observed slow or intermediate exchange with the copper(I)-bound species (Fig. 2), whose signals increased in intensity upon increasing the partner concentration. These features progressed to the same extent throughout the titration (Figs. 1 and 2). The linkers connecting the various metal-binding domains instead did not experience appreciable chemical shift changes calculated through the following equation (Fig. 3).Δδcombined=(Δδ(H1))2+125(Δδ(N15))22Eq. 1 FIGURE 2Metallation of the third, fifth, and sixth domains of WLN1-6 by copper(I)-HAH1.

C, variations in the position of signals between C1,2,4WLN1-6 mutant alone and in the presence of 6.0 eq of copper(I)-HAH1. These variations are quantitated through the combined chemical shift (52Garrett D.S. Seok Y.J. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4393-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), which is calculated from the experimental 1H and 15N chemical shift changes (Δδ(1H) and Δδ(15N), respectively) measured between corresponding peaks in the two forms, through Equation 1. The red bars indicate the peaks that became broad beyond detection upon interaction. The boundaries of the six MBDs along the sequence are shown by blue boxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The signals of domains 1, 2, and 4 always appeared in a single form, and the corresponding peaks had a position in the spectrum that depended on the copper(I)-HAH1/WLN1-6 ratio (Figs. 1 and 2). The chemical shift changes observed for corresponding residues in these domains were similar throughout the titration (Fig. 3). The perturbed signals of domains 1, 2, and 4 belonged to both the metal-binding loop and the loop between the second α-helix and the fourth β-strand of each domain (loop 5). Loop 5 is located at the interface of the metal-bridged adduct formed by the homologous yeast proteins (35Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Felli I.C. Gonnelli L. Hadjiliadis N. Pierattelli R. Rosato A. Voulgaris P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Finally, some signals of the residues of the MBD of domain 4 experienced significant line broadening (e.g. Met-423 in Fig. 1), which led to them becoming undetectable. Eventually, signals from the copper(I) form could be detected. For domains 3, 5, and 6, the chemical shift changes were mainly limited to the metal-binding loop, and loop 5 was not affected by interaction with the partner (Fig. 3). The signals of the apo form disappeared with a similar dependence on the concentration of copper(I)-HAH1. However, not all of the corresponding signals of the copper(I) form reappeared at the same protein ratio (see the signals from Val-275, Val-506, and Val-582 in Fig. 2). Domains 3, 5, and 6 were essentially fully metallated at the end of the titration (6:1 copper(I)-HAH1/WLN1-6 ratio). Looking at 15N-enriched copper(I)-HAH1 when interacting with apo-WLN1-6, it was observed that the interaction caused a change in the position of various peaks in the 1H-15N HSQC. In addition, essentially all of the signals of the residues around the metal-binding loop (Fig. 4) became broad beyond detection. In order to evaluate whether this was the result of the formation of an intermolecular adduct involving HAH1 and WLN1-6, we measured the correlation time (τR) for reorientation in solution of copper(I)-HAH1 alone and in the presence of equimolar WLN1-6. An increase of the τR of HAH1 in the latter system up to 7.4 ns from 4.9 ns of the isolated protein (38Anastassopoulou J. Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Katsari E. Rosato A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13046-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was determined, which resulted from the generalized increase of 15N R2 relaxation rates and the concomitant decrease of 15N R1 relaxation rates. This increase in the τR of HAH1 indicates that the latter protein formed an intermolecular adduct with one or more of the domains of WLN1-6. The overall behavior indicates for WLN1-6 a clear cut differentiation between the signals from domains 1, 2, and 4 on the one hand and 3, 5, and 6 on the other. From all of these data and also on the basis of the similar behavior of other systems, such as human Menkes and yeast Ccc2, it can be concluded that (i) all of the six domains of WLN1-6 were metallated by copper(I)-HAH1; (ii) the latter protein formed metal-bridged adducts with domains 1, 2, and 4 at levels detectable by NMR spectroscopy, which were in fast (on the NMR time scale) exchange with the single species; and (iii) the copper(I) form of domains 3, 5, and 6 exchanged with the apo form in an intermediate to slow regime. To discriminate whether domains 3, 5, and 6 were directly metallated by copper(I)-HAH1 or if an intramolecular copper transfer occurred, we studied the interaction of copper(I)-HAH1 with a mutant of WLN1-6, where the metal-binding cysteines of domains 1, 2, and 4 had been mutated to alanine (C1,2,4WLN1-6), thus making these domains unable to bind copper. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of C1,2,4WLN1-6 was essentially superimposable to that of wild type WLN1-6 recorded under the same experimental conditions, with the exception of the mutated amino acids and of their neighboring residues in sequence. Upon the addition of copper(I)-HAH1 to the mutant, we observed that domains 3, 5, and 6 acquired copper(I) from HAH1, since they experienced the same spectral changes that were observed in native WLN1-6 (Fig. 3). The new sets of signals of the metallated domains were in slow exchange with the apo form (Fig. 5). On the contrary, the signals of residues from domains 1, 2, and 4 did not experience significant chemical shift changes, indicating that no adducts were formed with the partner (Fig. 3). When the WLN1-6 construct was presented with copper(I)-HAH1, the behavior of its six MBDs differentiated. In fact, the NMR signals of the backbone amide moieties from three domains (the first, second, and fourth) experienced a variation of their position that was dependent on the copper(I)-HAH1/WLN1-6 ratio (Fig. 1). Instead, for the other three domains (the third, fifth, and sixth), the addition of copper(I)-HAH1 gave rise to another set of signals in slow or intermediate exchange with the apo form (Fig. 2). It has been extensively demonstrated in the available literature for related systems that the present behavior of the signals of the amino acids in domains 1, 2, and 4 results from the formation of an intermolecular, copper(I)-bridged adduct with HAH1 (14Achila D.

In the present work, the formation of this adduct was experimentally shown by the increase of the τR of HAH1. Instead, the behavior shown by domains 3, 5, and 6 is attributable to the occurrence of metal transfer from the metallochaperone without accumulation of the protein-protein adduct. Indeed, in a closely related study of a two-domain construct of WLN that comprised only domains 3 and 4, it was demonstrated that the addition of copper(I)-HAH1 to apo-WLN3-4 induced a significant increase of the tumbling rate of domain 4, consistent with formation of an intermolecular copper(I)-bridged adduct, but did not affect the tumbling rate of domain 3 (15Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Rosenzweig A.C. Yatsunyk L.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Within each group of domains (1, 2, and 4 on one hand, 3, 5, and 6 on the other), the signals from corresponding residues of the various domains did not all behave in the same way. Regarding domains 1, 2, and 4, the features of the signals of the fourth MBD suggested that the complex between this domain and copper(I)-HAH1 had a slower dissociation rate than in the case of the first and second MBDs. For domains 3, 5, and 6, the signals of the copper(I) form became detectable at different copper(I)-HAH1/WLN1-6 ratios, despite the similar affinity for the metal ion of the three domains (29Yatsunyk L.A. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8622-8631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This is presumably due to the diverse dynamics of this loop in each MBD, related to conformational equilibria involving the apo and copper(I) forms, resulting in different broadening of the signals. We then investigated whether the metallation of domains 3, 5, and 6 could be carried out by HAH1 alone or required the prior formation of an adduct involving one among domains 1, 2, or 4. As shown in Figs. 3 and 5, the C1,2,4WLN1-6 mutant could be metallated by copper(I)-HAH1. In addition, there was no significant perturbation of the backbone signals of domains 1, 2, and 4 (Fig. 3). The presence of the metal-binding cysteines is thus required for the formation of the intermolecular adduct. This confirms that the adduct is metal-mediated, analogously to the yeast Atx1/Ccc2a system (35Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Felli I.C. Gonnelli L. Hadjiliadis N. Pierattelli R. Rosato A. Voulgaris P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it appears that the metal transfer process from copper(I)-HAH1 to the third, fifth, or sixth MBDs can take place even without any prior intermolecular interaction with the other domains. In a previously reported study (14Achila D. Banci L. Bertini I. Bunce J. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5729-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), a double domain construct comprising the fifth and sixth metal-binding domains of the WLN protein was unable to receive directly the metal from copper(I)-HAH1. This difference from our results is most likely linked to the different protein as well as to the different experimental conditions employed in the two studies and is not unprecedented. Indeed, for the third domain of the MNK protein, a difference in metal-binding capability has been reported when comparing the isolated domain to the six-domain construct (28Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Della Malva N. Migliardi M. Rosato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23140-23146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 44Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Della Malva N. Rosato A. Herrmann T. Wüthrich K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29141-29147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, the isolated second WLN MBD required somewhat higher concentrations of the partner metallochaperone than the fourth to afford comparable chemical shift variations (14Achila D. Banci L. Bertini I. Bunce J. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5729-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), whereas in the present WLN1-6 construct, the first, second, and fourth MBDs experienced similar chemical shift variations along the titration. Considering all of the available experimental data on the wild type and mutant WLN and MNK systems (28Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Della Malva N. Migliardi M. Rosato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23140-23146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), it appears that copper(I) can be transferred directly by the metallochaperone to any of the six MBDs. A mechanism in which the metal ion is first transferred to a domain and then relocates to another domain (to be ultimately pumped across the membrane) cannot be ruled out. The different interaction of the MBDs of the MNK (28Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Della Malva N. Migliardi M. Rosato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23140-23146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and WLN proteins with copper(I)-HAH1 reflects different thermodynamic properties of the various species involved in the metal transfer pathway. In all known cases, including those of the yeast and bacterial homologues of the present proteins, it can be assumed that copper(I) transfer to a soluble MBD of the ATPase occurs according to the following scheme (35Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Felli I.C. Gonnelli L. Hadjiliadis N. Pierattelli R. Rosato A. Voulgaris P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), where the metal ion bridges the proteins in the chaperone-Cu(I)-ATPase species, as it is coordinated by two cysteines of one protein and one cysteine of the other. For the yeast system, there are two forms of the chaperone-Cu(I)-ATPase species in equilibrium (35Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Felli I.C. Gonnelli L. Hadjiliadis N. Pierattelli R. Rosato A. Voulgaris P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The two forms differ in the identity of the protein providing the two cysteines, the form with the ATPase providing two cysteines being more stable (35Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Felli I.C.

In yeast, the affinity for copper(I) of the metallochaperone (Atx1) and of the first MBD of the Ccc2 ATPase is nearly the same (31Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18611-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). When 1 mm copper(I)-Atx1 is mixed with 1 mm Ccc2a, a copper(I)-bridged adduct forms, involving ∼70% of the protein molecules (45Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41365-41376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The adduct is in fast exchange with the isolated proteins. The various MBDs of MNK (27Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Migliardi M. Rosato A. Wang S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 46Banci L. Bertini I. Chasapis C. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and WLN (29Yatsunyk L.A. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8622-8631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have a higher affinity for copper(I) than HAH1. In WLN, three MBDs form an adduct at detectable amounts with copper(I)-HAH1, whereas for the other three MBDs, the complex is not detectable, and only the final metallated form can be observed. In MNK, only two domains (the first and the fourth) form an adduct (28Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Della Malva N. Migliardi M. Rosato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23140-23146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) at similar protein concentrations; the second MBD of MNK is metallated by copper(I)-HAH1 without the formation of detectable amounts of a protein-protein adduct. This behavior is observed both in the context of the entire tail (28Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Della Malva N. Migliardi M. Rosato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23140-23146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and for the isolated domain (46Banci L. Bertini I. Chasapis C. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The different behaviors described above correspond to different energy profiles for the copper transfer process, which are sketched in Fig. 6, for the reaction of Scheme 1. In Ccc2, the final state has a free energy only slightly lower than the initial state (Fig. 6A), whereas this difference is somewhat higher in MNK and WLN (Fig. 6B). Indeed, the HAH1-Cu(I)-WLN complex is more similar to the final product than the Atx1-Cu(I)-Ccc2 complex. In both cases, the occurrence of detectable amounts of the intermediate adduct is possible if its free energy is close to that of the final state of Scheme 1 but is independent of the relative affinity for copper(I) of the metallochaperone and the ATPase. When the adduct is formed, it is in fast equilibrium with the free proteins, implying low activation barriers. On the other hand, for those MBDs that do not form detectable amounts of adduct, the equilibrium between the apo and copper(I) forms is slow, regardless of the presence of HAH1. The latter, therefore, does not act as a catalyst in lowering the activation barrier between the two forms of the metal-binding domains (Fig. 6B). The N-terminal tail of P1B-type ATPases may have a regulatory role in the enzyme activity and/or trafficking (17Rice W.J. Kovashilin A. Stokes D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Cater M.A. La Fontaine S. Mercer J.F. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Cater M.A. Forbes J.R. La Fontaine S. Cox D. Mercer J.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In particular, the tail could have an autoinhibitory role in the absence of copper(I) (18Hatori Y. Hirata A. Toyoshima C. Lewis D. Pilankatta R. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22541-22549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Huster D. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32212-32218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The structural model of CopA, a P1B-type ATPase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, has suggested that in the absence of copper(I), the tail is in close contact with the other cytoplasmic domains (47Wu C.C. Rice W.J. Stokes D.L. Structure. 2008; 16: 976-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both for WLN and MNK, the regulation of the ATPase activity and/or trafficking by the N-terminal tail could depend upon the interaction with copper(I)-HAH1, leading to a variation of the contacts of the tail with the other domains of the enzyme. Indeed, the present data, as well as those on MNK1-6 (28Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Della Malva N. Migliardi M. Rosato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23140-23146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggested that the aforementioned rearrangements are linked to the formation, and presumably accumulation at high intracellular copper(I) concentrations, of adducts between the MBDs of the tail and copper(I)-HAH1. This view would also provide a rationale for the observed dependence of ATPase trafficking on the expression levels of HAH1 (48Hamza I. Prohaska J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Even when the equilibrium leading to the formation of the adduct with the metallochaperone or to the transfer of copper(I) is not fully shifted toward the products, every time one of these molecular events takes place, it can trigger the conformational rearrangements of the ATPase that ultimately lead to ATP hydrolysis. The latter reaction is effectively irreversible and thus pushes forward the catalytic cycle. The effective protein concentration in the cell is not known; the relatively high equilibrium constants for the protein-protein adducts observed here imply that the processes described above may occur also at micromolar concentrations. The available literature points to the MBD or to the two MBDs closest to the transmembrane region of MNK and WLN as playing a role different than the most N-terminal four domains (49Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 50Mercer J.F. Barnes N. Stevenson J. Strausak D. Llanos R.M. Biometals. 2003; 16: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this respect, it is noteworthy that for both human proteins, the fifth and sixth MBDs are metallated by the metallochaperone without forming detectable amounts of complex. The metallation of these two domains does not require the formation of copper(I)-mediated adducts with other metal-binding domains within the cytosolic tail, as shown by mutagenesis data for both MNK (28Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Della Malva N. Migliardi M. Rosato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23140-23146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and WLN (Fig. 3). This is at variance with what observed for yeast Ccc2. This ATPase has only two MBDs, of which at least one forms a complex with copper(I)-Atx1. Of the first four MBDs, three domains in WLN and two in MNK can form detectable amounts of an adduct. The above differences are the consequence of subtle mutations of their surface properties, which define the energetic profile of the interaction, with copper(I)-HAH1 among those depicted in Fig. 6. This differentiation could contribute to tuning the regulation of the activity and/or trafficking of the ATPases. Specifically, for WLN and MNK, this could be a means to discriminate their properties in the tissues where they are coexpressed (51Linz R. Lutsenko S. J. Bioenerg.

An alternative approach to identifying specific phases is to measure the lag between the S and P waves. We cross-correlate vertical and horizontal seismograms to reveal signals common to both, but with the horizontal delayed with respect to the vertical. This lagged correlation represents the time interval between vertical compressional waves and horizontal shear waves. Measurements of this interval, combined with location techniques, resolve the depth of tremor sources within ±2 kilometers. For recent Cascadia tremor, the sources locate near or on the subducting slab interface. Strong correlations and steady S - P time differences imply that tremor consists of radiation from repeating sources."

MD ranks fifth among leading causes of global disease burden including developing countries, and by year 2030 it is predicted to represent one of the three leading causes of burden of disease worldwide [1], [2]. MD is also a risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and a major risk factor for suicide [3]. Despite extensive investigations, the exact mechanisms responsible for MD have not been identified, and current therapeutics are based on serendipitous discoveries rather than on bench-to-bedside, targeted drug discovery [4]. In addition, although clinically efficient antidepressant drugs do exist, the situation is in many cases far from ideal. Shortcomings such as low remission and/or high treatment-resistance rates, slow onset of action, side effects, and drug–drug interactions merit the exploration of all plausible agents that are effective, tolerable, and safe, and that improve maintenance of wellness [5]–[8]. Accordingly, there is an enormous need for joint experimental efforts between preclinical and clinical scientists.

Understanding MD in its etiology and biological phenomenological characteristics could improve its recognition and treatment [8]–[11].

Both symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria possess diverse arrays of carbohydrate-processing enzymes that are used to degrade a wide range of host glycoconjugates. Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus), a Gram-positive, encapsulated pathogen that can cause acute respiratory disease (pneumonia), otitis media, meningitis, and several other serious diseases, is responsible for causing millions deaths annually in the young and the elderly and relies on its carbohydrate-processing enzymes for its full virulence. The ability of this bacterium to degrade hyaluronic acid- and sialic acid-containing glycans in the host has long been correlated with the virulence of this pathogen (1.Garcia-Suarez Mdel M. Vazquez F. Mendez F.J. Enferm. Infecc. Microbiol. Clin. 2006; 24: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). More recently, genome sequencing studies combined with large scale efforts directed toward screening for new virulence factors have suggested that a large and diverse array of carbohydrate-degrading enzymes is necessary for full virulence of the pneumococcus (2.Tettelin H. Nelson K.E. Paulsen I.T. Eisen J.A. Read T.D. Peterson S. Heidelberg J. DeBoy R.T. Haft D.H. Dodson R.J. Durkin A.S. Gwinn M. Kolonay J.F. Nelson W.C. Peterson J.D. Umayam L.A. White O. Salzberg S.L.

Among this arsenal of carbohydrate-processing enzymes is a group known as endohexosaminidases, enzymes that act to cleave the glycosidic linkage between the two N-acetylglucosamine units that make up the chitobiose core of N-glycans (Fig. 1A). The functional role of pneumococcal carbohydrate-degrading enzymes is generally thought to harvest nutrients to promote bacterial growth (4.Burnaugh A.M. Frantz L.J. King S.J. J.

Nose M. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 75: 838-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).There appears to be two main classes of endohexosaminidases. One group of endohexosaminidases is evolutionarily related to chitinases, and these enzymes are found in the same family of glycoside hydrolases, GH18 (for a discussion of the CAZY classification system of the glycoside hydrolases see Ref. 7.Cantarel B.L.

The second group, to which Endo-D belongs, is found in family GH85 of glycoside hydrolases and is of considerable interest because of its potential use in biosynthesis of complex N-glycans. Elegant studies have detailed the ability of these enzymes to efficiently transfer en bloc the N-core of an appropriate carbohydrate donor to an N-acetylglucosaminylated asparagine residue of a polypeptide backbone and thereby chemoenzymatically generate glycoproteins having precisely defined glycoforms (8.Yamamoto K.

Therefore, the ability of GH85 endohexosaminidases to use sugar oxazoline donors strongly suggests that GH85 enzymes also use a substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism.The substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism used by these four families of enzymes results in cleavage of the glycosidic bond with retention of configuration in two discrete steps. Two enzymic carboxylic acid residues play key catalytic roles (18.Arming S. Strobl B. Wechselberger C. Kreil G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24.Synstad B. Gaseidnes S. Van Aalten D.M. Vriend G. Nielsen J.E. Eijsink V.G. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3835-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the first step of the mechanism, a carboxylic acid residue that hydrogen bonds to the glycosidic oxygen acts as a general acid, facilitating departure of the leaving group. Expulsion of the leaving group is also aided by concomitant attack of the carbonyl oxygen of the 2-acetamido group of the substrate. The acetamido group is oriented, and its nucleophilicity enhanced, through donation of a hydrogen bond to a second suitably positioned carboxylate residue. This residue has been postulated to act as a general base to aid formation of an oxazoline intermediate (26.Cetinbas N. Macauley M.S. Stubbs K.A. Drapala R. Vocadlo D.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3835-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or, alternatively, to stabilize an oxazolinium ion intermediate (23.van Aalten D.M. Komander D. Synstad B. Gaseidnes S.

Soc. 2009; 130: 17620-17628Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The resulting intermediate is broken down through a process that is the near microscopic reverse of the first step; the general acid/base residue now facilitates the attack of water, and the second residue facilitates departure of the 2-acetamido group to form the sugar hemiacetal product with overall retention of stereochemistry.Like other glycoside hydrolases using substrate-assisted catalysis, the endohexosaminidases also process substrates having a 2-acetamido group. Detailed mutagenesis and chemical rescue studies have provided good support for a completely conserved carboxylic acid acting as the general acid/base residue (28.Fujita K. Sato R. Toma K. Kitahara K. Suganuma T. Yamamoto K. Takegawa K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2007; 142: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, based on sequence alignments of known GH85 enzymes, there is no obvious carboxylate residue that might serve to enhance the nucleophilicity of the acetamido group. Very recently, Yamamoto and co-workers (29.Umekawa M. Huang W. Li B. Fujita K. Ashida H. Wang L.X. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4469-4479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) have proposed that a conserved asparagine fulfills the same function because they observed that deletion of the side chain by mutagenesis resulted in a dramatic loss of activity. Interestingly, endohexosaminidases, in which either of these residues are mutated in a fairly conservative manner, are still able to catalyze the second step of the reaction, using oxazoline substrates as donor sugars and transferring the saccharide to a suitable acceptor (29.Umekawa M.

Given the noncanonical active site residues found in these enzymes, they also emphasized the need for more rigorous kinetic support and structural studies (29.Umekawa M. Huang W. Li B. Fujita K.

Chem. 2008; 283: 4469-4479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).Here we describe mechanistic studies of S. pneumoniae Endo-D using small molecule probes (Fig. 1, C and D) in conjunction with high resolution x-ray crystallographic analysis of the uncomplexed enzyme and the enzyme in complex with an inhibitor that mimics either the oxazoline intermediate or a closely derived transition state. These data collectively provide compelling support for GH85 using a mechanism involving substrate-assisted catalysis. They also furnish detailed insight into the roles of active site residues and how these enzymes effect catalysis, suggesting that the GH85, GH18, and GH56 enzymes, which have a similar configuration of catalytic residues, may use an unusual proton shuttle to coordinate effective general acid and base catalysis with concomitant cleavage of the glycosidic bond. Finally, these findings provide a blueprint that may be used to facilitate protein engineering of these enzymes to improve their function as biocatalysts for synthesizing glycoproteins having defined glycoforms (13.Li B.

The forward primer was GH85F (5′-TATATACATATGGAAAAAGAAGTCCAGCCAGATGTCCCTAAA-3′), which was engineered to have a 5′ NheI restriction endonuclease site, and the reverse primer was GH85R (5′-GCGCGCCTCGAGTTAATCTTTTACAGTCATACCCCAATCAAA-3′), which had a 3′ XhoI restriction site. The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into pET28a (Novagen) via the NheI and XhoI restriction sites using standard molecular biology procedures to generate pGH85. The DNA sequence of the resulting construct was verified by bidirectional DNA sequencing. The resulting gene fusion encoded a His6 tag fused to the SpGH85 catalytic domain by an intervening thrombin protease cleavage site.Protein Production and PurificationSpGH85 was produced in Escherichia coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) using LB media supplemented with 50 μg ml-1 of kanamycin. Cultures were grown at 37 °C until they reached an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5-0.7, whereupon protein production was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. After further incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and ruptured by chemical lysis. SpGH85 was purified by Ni2+-immobilized metal affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl S-200 column (GE Healthcare). Size exclusion chromatography was performed using 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Selenomethionine-labeled SpGH85 (SeMet-SpGH85) was prepared using the procedures described previously (32.Ficko-Blean E. Boraston A.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Crystallogr. Commun. 2005; 61: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and purified as for the native protein. Protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using the calculated molar extinction coefficient of 155,160 cm-1 m-1 (33.Gasteiger E. Gattiker A. Hoogland C. Ivanyi I.

HCl was added until the solution was saturated, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 16 h at room temperature. As the reaction proceeded, the starting material dissolved into the solvent. Upon completion of the reaction the solvent was partially removed in vacuo to ⅓ of the volume. Dichloromethane (40 ml) was added, and this solution was washed extensively with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate, water, and then saturated sodium chloride. The organic extracts were dried over MgSO4 and filtered, and solvent was removed in vacuo. The compounds were not susceptible to crystallization; however, analysis of the products by NMR showed minimal contamination with yields ranging from 70 to 90%.

An equal volume of 1 m NaOH was then added, and the resulting mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature. Ethyl acetate (5 volumes) was then added, and the resulting organic phase was successively washed with 1 m NaOH (2× 1 volume), water (1 volume), and saturated sodium chloride solution (1 volume).

Phycobiliprotein biosynthesis, which involves several post-translational modifications including covalent attachment of the linear tetrapyrrole chromophores (phycobilins) to apoproteins, begins to be well understood. However, the biosynthetic pathway to the blue-green-absorbing phycourobilin (λmax ∼ 495 nm) remained unknown, although it is the major phycobilin of cyanobacteria living in oceanic areas where blue light penetrates deeply into the water column. We describe a unique trichromatic phycocyanin, R-PC V, extracted from phycobilisomes of Synechococcus sp. strain WH8102. It is evolutionarily remarkable as the only chromoprotein known so far that absorbs the whole wavelength range between 450 and 650 nm. R-PC V carries a phycourobilin chromophore on its α-subunit, and this can be considered an extreme case of adaptation to blue-green light. We also discovered the enzyme, RpcG, responsible for its biosynthesis. This monomeric enzyme catalyzes binding of the green-absorbing phycoerythrobilin at cysteine 84 with concomitant isomerization to phycourobilin. This reaction is analogous to formation of the orange-absorbing phycoviolobilin from the red-absorbing phycocyanobilin that is catalyzed by the lyase-isomerase PecE/F in some freshwater cyanobacteria. The fusion protein, RpcG, and the heterodimeric PecE/F are mutually interchangeable in a heterologous expression system in Escherichia coli. The novel R-PC V likely optimizes rod-core energy transfer in phycobilisomes and thereby adaptation of a major phytoplankton group to the blue-green light prevailing in oceanic waters.

To perform photosynthesis, the main energetic basis for life on earth, phototrophic organisms have to cope with large spatial and temporal variations of light conditions. A major evolutionary step in meeting this challenge was the development of light-harvesting complexes, the most variable part of the photosynthetic apparatus (1Glazer A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By binding a large number of chromophores, these antennas can considerably enhance the photon absorption capacity of reaction centers that are responsible for the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy. Pigmented proteins associated with light-harvesting complexes also fill (at least partially) the large gap between the absorption bands of reaction center chlorophylls (e.g. ∼440 and 680 nm for chlorophyll a found in most oxygenic organisms). Antennas also transport the excitons with minimal loss and transduce high energy excitons into the low energy ones required by the reaction centers (1Glazer A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Green B. Parson W. Light-harvesting Antennas in Photosynthesis. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2003Crossref Google Scholar). They do not only vary among the different organisms but also with time within individual organisms, thereby providing the flexibility needed by the photosynthetic apparatus to work efficiently under varying ambient conditions. Cyanobacteria, which contribute a substantial fraction of global photosynthesis (3Garcia-Pichel F. Belnap J. Neuer S. Schanz F. Algol. Stud. 2003; 109: 213-228Crossref Google Scholar), evolved a particularly sophisticated and dynamic antenna complex, the phycobilisome (PBS) 4The abbreviations used are: PBS, phycobilisome; PC, phycocyanin; C-PC, C-type phycocyanin; PCB, phycocyanobilin; R-PC, R-phycocyanin (prefix R originally referred to as “rhodophytes,” but now designates spectral type); RpcA, apo-α-subunit of R-PC; RpcG, fused PUB lyase (EF-type); IEF, isoelectric focusing; PE, phycoerythrin; PEB, phycoerythrobilin; PEC, phycoerythrocyanin; PecA, apo-α-PEC; PecE, PecF, subunits of PVB:α-PEC lyase-isomerase; PUB, phycourobilin; PVB, phycoviolobilin; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.

The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 139-216Crossref Google Scholar). This extramembranous structure with a size of several MDa is mainly composed of the deeply colored and intensely fluorescing phycobiliproteins. A single PBS, generally composed of a central core and 6–8 radiating rods, contains hundreds of linear tetrapyrrole chromophores (phycobilins) that are covalently attached to their apoproteins. The remarkably wide diversity of PBSs found in nature is due to the large number of possible combinations of phycobiliproteins with various pigmentations that constitute the rods. Marine Synechococcus, the second most abundant oxyphototrophic organism on Earth after Prochlorococcus (3Garcia-Pichel F. Belnap J. Neuer S. Schanz F. Algol.

Musée Océanographique, Monaco1999: 457-475Google Scholar), is the cyanobacterial group in which the largest diversity of PBS rod composition (and hence pigmentation) can be found (7Six C. Thomas J.C. Garczarek L. Ostrowski M. Dufresne A. Blot N. Scanlan D.J. Partensky F. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R259Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This is particularly useful to enable this group to cope with the variety of light environments encountered in marine ecosystems. PBSs can, at least in part, be reversibly dissociated (8Canaani O. Lipschultz C.A. Gantt E. FEBS Lett. 1980; 115: 225-229Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 9Lipschultz C.A. Gantt E.

Progress in understanding PBS assembly was slow, however, due to the complex and poorly understood post-translational modifications of the phycobiliproteins required prior to assembly. Only after maturation can phycobiliproteins form spontaneously trimers, which are then integrated into the PBSs by interaction with specific structural proteins, so-called linker polypeptides. These post-translational modifications reactions include the covalent attachment of 1–4 chromophores to each individual apoprotein (11Fairchild C.D. Glazer A.N. J. Biol.

Acta. 2005; 1708: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) (see UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry Q1XDQ2). Of the three major phycobilins, the red-absorbing phycocyanobilin (PCB) and the green-absorbing phycoerythrobilin (PEB) are generated by specialized reductases from biliverdin (Fig. 1), the cleavage product of the heme macrocycle (26Dammeyer T. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2008; 7: 1121-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Free PCB and PEB molecules are then attached by phycobilin lyases to specific binding sites on the phycobiliprotein subunits (18Scheer H. Zhao K.-H. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of a third chromophore, phycourobilin (PUB), which has never been found in free form, was until now enigmatic. Phycobiliproteins from all marine cyanobacteria adapted to oceanic waters, including Synechococcus, Crocosphaera, and Trichodesmium, are particularly rich in PUB, probably making it the most abundant phycobilin in the ocean (7Six C.

Carpenter E.J. Karentz D. Falkowski P.G. Limnol. Oceanogr. 1999; 44: 608-617Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Indeed, this chromophore absorbs efficiently blue-green light (λmax ∼495 nm), a wavelength range prevailing in open oceanic subsurface waters and which is only poorly absorbed by chlorophyll a. Thus, elucidating the PUB biosynthesis process has been a challenge for many years. So far, only three types of phycocyanin were known in marine Synechococcus spp., and none of them contained PUB. Among the 11 recently sequenced strains (31Dufresne A. Ostrowski M. Scanlan D.J. Garczarek L. Mazard S. Palenik B.P. Paulsen I.T. Tandeau de Marsac N. Wincker P. Dossat C. Ferriera S. Johnson J. Post A.F. Hess W.R. Partensky F. Genome Biol. 2008; 9: R90Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), two (WH5701 and RS9917) have PBSs with rods entirely constituted of C-type phycocyanin (C-PC (7Six C. Thomas J.C. Garczarek L. Ostrowski M. Dufresne A. Blot N. Scanlan D.J. Partensky F. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R259Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar)), a form frequently found in freshwater cyanobacteria (5Sidler W.A. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 139-216Crossref Google Scholar). This C-PC binds PCB at all three available chromophore binding sites: α-84, β-82, and β-153. Several phycoerythrin-containing marine Synechococcus strains possess phycocyanin of the R-type that carry PEB either at β-153 only (R-PC III), as in WH7805, or both at α-84 and at β-153 (R-PC II), as in WH7803 (5Sidler W.A.

Using comparative genomics, candidate genes were recently retrieved that code for the different phycobilin lyases required for catalyzing the chromophorylation of these various phycocyanins (7Six C. Thomas J.C. Garczarek L. Ostrowski M. Dufresne A. Blot N. Scanlan D.J. Partensky F. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R259Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).

WH7805 contains phycobilin lyase genes (called rpcE-F) that are homologous to cpcE-F, and it has been suggested that they could encode a phycocyanin α-84 PEB lyase (34Wilbanks S.M. Glazer A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1226-1235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In WH7803, the cpcT gene is missing and replaced by rpcT, which has been proposed to encode a phycocyanin β-153 PEB lyase (7Six C. Thomas J.C. Garczarek L. Ostrowski M. Dufresne A. Blot N. Scanlan D.J. Partensky F. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R259Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In four sequenced marine Synechococcus, including two oceanic strains with a particularly high PUB content, WH8102 and CC9605, and two type IV chromatic adapters, RS9916 and BL107, the rpcE-F operon is replaced by a single gene, rpcG (7Six C. Thomas J.C. Garczarek L. Ostrowski M. Dufresne A. Blot N. Scanlan D.J. Partensky F. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R259Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This gene appears to encode a fusion protein, and its N and C termini show much higher homology to Nostoc (Anabaena) sp. PCC 7120 PecE and PecF, respectively, which form the heterodimeric phycoerythrocyanin α-84 PCB lyase-isomerase, than to CpcE/F or RpcE/F lyases from other marine Synechococcus. Moreover, the RpcG C terminus carries a short motif (NHCQGN) that has been assigned an isomerase function in the F-subunit of PecF (35Zhao K.H. Wu D. Zhou M. Zhang L. Böhm S. Bubenzer C. Scheer H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8126-8137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This motif is responsible for the concomitant isomerization of the A-ring of PCB to generate the PVB chromophore. The analogous isomerization starting from free PEB would thus be expected to generate a cysteine-bound PUB chromophore (Fig. 1). This hypothesis led us to explore the function and specificity of the putative lyase-isomerase RpcG from two marine Synechococcus strains by a heterologous approach in Escherichia coli and to investigate the implications for phycobiliprotein pigmentation. Preparation of Intact Phycobilisomes-Marine Synechococcus spp. strains WH8102 and RS9916 were grown in PCR-S11 medium under continuous white light as described previously (36Everroad C. Six C. Partensky F. Thomas J.C. Holtzendorff J. Wood A.M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3345-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Extraction of intact PBSs was carried out with 0.75 m phosphate buffer on a sucrose density gradient as described previously (37Six C. Thomas J.-C. Thion L. Lemoine Y. Zal F. Partensky F. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1685-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PBSs used for purifying R-PC V were concentrated by ultracentrifugation, and pellets were either used immediately or kept frozen at -30 °C until use. Isolation of the Trichromatic Phycocyanin, R-PC V-PBS pellets were solubilized in Hepes buffer (10 mm, pH 7.2) containing NaCl (5 mm), Pefabloc (1 mm), EDTA (1 mm), and β-mercaptoethanol (1%, v/v). PBS dissociation was allowed for 90 min at 0 °C. Individual phycobiliproteins were separated by non-denaturing isoelectric focusing (IEF) using 6% polyacrylamide (30% acrylamide, 1.6% bisacrylamide) tube gels, 4 mm in diameter, containing a convenient mixture of ampholytes (4% Servalyt 4–6, 1% Servalyt 3–7). Protein (200 μg) was loaded on the gel, and the isoelectric focusing was achieved with NaOH (20 mm) as a cathode buffer and phosphoric acid (0.045%) as the anode buffer (36Everroad C. Six C. Partensky F. Thomas J.C. Holtzendorff J. Wood A.M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3345-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Voltage was gradually increased from 150 to 400 V by 50-V steps every 45 min. Phycocyanin was found focusing on the basic part of the gel, as a violet purple band, near various PE complexes that were all more acidic. The allophycocyanin components, focusing at lower acidic pH, were lost under these conditions. Bands of interest were cut out and kept frozen until further characterization. Subunit Isolation by Denaturing Isoelectric Focusing and Mass Spectrometry-Denaturing polyacrylamide gels were prepared in 4-mm tubes as described above, the only modification being the addition of urea (8 m). Bands containing native biliproteins obtained by non-denaturing IEF were cut into small pieces and incubated in situ, on the top of urea acrylamide gels, in urea (9 m) containing mercaptoethanol (1% v/v) for 45 min, before starting the IEF in the same conditions as described above. All operations were made under dim light or, when possible, in complete darkness. Colored bands were cut out at the end of electrophoresis and frozen until use. For mass spectrometric characterization of polypeptides, bands were cut out from IEF gels and fragmented into small pieces, denatured with 6% lithium dodecyl sulfate denaturation buffer, and loaded on lithium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE plate gels as described (37Six C. Thomas J.-C. Thion L. Lemoine Y. Zal F. Partensky F. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1685-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Coomassie Blue G 250-stained bands of phycobiliprotein subunits were analyzed by mass spectrometry using the facility at the “Unité de Phytopharmacie et Médiateurs Chimiques,” Institut Nationale de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) Versailles, France. Details on mass spectrometry experimental procedures can be found elsewhere (36Everroad C. Six C. Partensky F. Thomas J.C. Holtzendorff J. Wood A.M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3345-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In-gel Spectroscopic Analyses of Separated Biliproteins-Absorption spectra were obtained with a model DW2 spectrophotometer (Aminco Chance, Bogart, GA) using fragments of acrylamide gels containing the separated biliproteins. Polyacrylamide ampholyte gel fragments, with or without 8 m urea, were used as a blank. For recording the absorption spectra of denatured α- and β-subunits of R-PC V, samples were soaked for 15 min in acidic urea (8 m, acidified with HCl to pH 3) before recording the spectra. Gene Cloning-Cloning and expression followed generally the standard procedures (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed.

For application of the multiplasmid expression-chromophorylation system in E. coli (20Zhao K.-H. Su P. Tu J.M. Wang X. Liu H. Plöscher M. Eichacker L. Yang B. Zhou M. Scheer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Heterologous Gene Expression-Duet plasmids were transformed together into BL21(DE3) cells under the appropriate antibiotic selections (chloramphenicol for pACYC-derivative, streptomycin for pCDF-derivative, kanamycin for pCOLA-derivative or pET30-derivative, ampicillin for pETDuet-derivative, see supplemental Table S2). To test the chromophorylation of the various apoproteins (CpcA, CpcB(C84S), CpcB(C155I), PecA, PecB(C84A), PecB(C155I), CpeA1, CpeA(C139S), CpeB, CpeB(C48A/C59S/C165S), and CpeA2, MpeA, RpcA), the respective encoding plasmid was transformed together with PCB- or PEB-producing plasmids (pACYC-ho1-pcyA for PCB, pCDF-ho1-pebB plus pACYC-pebA for PEB) and one or two of the lyase-producing plasmids into E. coli BL21(DE3) (supplemental S2). In the control experiments, plasmids containing lyase genes were omitted from the transformations. For chromophorylation in E. coli, cells were grown at 16–20 °C, depending on the genes to be expressed. 18–24 h after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with doubly distilled water, and stored at -20 °C until use. Isolation of Heterologously Synthesized Chromoproteins-For isolation and purification of chromophorylated proteins, E. coli cells were suspended is Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm, pH 8) containing NaCl (300 mm) and imidazole (5 mm) and lysed by ultrasonication. The lysate was then centrifuged twice (10 min, 10,000 × g) to remove cell debris, and tagged proteins were isolated from the supernatant by Ni2+ chromatography as described previously (19Zhao K.-H.

If necessary, the affinity-enriched proteins were further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences, Shanghai, China) over a DEAE FF column developed with a gradient of 0–0.6 m NaCl in potassium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.0). Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis-SDS-PAGE was performed with the buffer system of Laemmli (42Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W1964809585,"Oncolytic viruses are viruses that specifically infect cancer cells and kill them, while leaving healthy cells largely intact. Their ability to spread through the tumor makes them an attractive therapy approach. While promising results have been observed in clinical trials, solid success remains elusive since we lack understanding of the basic principles that govern the dynamical interactions between the virus and the cancer. In this respect, computational models can help experimental research at optimizing treatment regimes. Although preliminary mathematical work has been performed, this suffers from the fact that individual models are largely arbitrary and based on biologically uncertain assumptions. Here, we present a general framework to study the dynamics of oncolytic viruses that is independent of uncertain and arbitrary mathematical formulations. We find two categories of dynamics, depending on the assumptions about spatial constraints that govern that spread of the virus from cell to cell. If infected cells are mixed among uninfected cells, there exists a viral replication rate threshold beyond which tumor control is the only outcome. On the other hand, if infected cells are clustered together (e.g. in a solid tumor), then we observe more complicated dynamics in which the outcome of therapy might go either way, depending on the initial number of cells and viruses. We fit our models to previously published experimental data and discuss aspects of model validation, selection, and experimental design. This framework can be used as a basis for model selection and validation in the context of future, more detailed experimental studies. It can further serve as the basis for future, more complex models that take into account other clinically relevant factors such as immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2078426337,"Background Most information on invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections comes from temperate countries. There are considerable knowledge gaps in epidemiology, treatment, drug resistance and outcome of invasive S. aureus infection in the tropics. Methods A prospective, observational study of S. aureus bacteraemia was conducted in a 1000-bed regional hospital in northeast Thailand over 1 year. Detailed clinical data were collected and final outcomes determined at 12 weeks, and correlated with antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of infecting isolates. Principal Findings Ninety-eight patients with S. aureus bacteraemia were recruited. The range of clinical manifestations was similar to that reported from temperate countries. The prevalence of endocarditis was 14%. The disease burden was highest at both extremes of age, whilst mortality increased with age. The all-cause mortality rate was 52%, with a mortality attributable to S. aureus of 44%. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was responsible for 28% of infections, all of which were healthcare-associated. Mortality rates for MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) were 67% (18/27) and 46% (33/71), respectively (p = 0.11). MRSA isolates were multidrug resistant. Only vancomycin or fusidic acid would be suitable as empirical treatment options for suspected MRSA infection. Conclusions S. aureus is a significant pathogen in northeast Thailand, with comparable clinical manifestations and a similar endocarditis prevalence but higher mortality than industrialised countries. S. aureus bacteraemia is frequently associated with exposure to healthcare settings with MRSA causing a considerable burden of disease. Further studies are required to define setting-specific strategies to reduce mortality from S. aureus bacteraemia, prevent MRSA transmission, and to define the burden of S. aureus disease and emergence of drug resistance throughout the developing world."
https://openalex.org/W2127304974,"Bacterial pathogens need to scavenge iron from their host for growth and proliferation during infection. They have evolved several strategies to do this, one being the biosynthesis and excretion of small, high-affinity iron chelators known as siderophores. The biosynthesis of siderophores is an important area of study, not only for potential therapeutic intervention but also to illuminate new enzyme chemistries. Two general pathways for siderophore biosynthesis exist: the well-characterized nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-dependent pathway and the NRPS-independent siderophore (NIS) pathway, which relies on a different family of sparsely investigated synthetases. Here we report structural and biochemical studies of AcsD from Pectobacterium (formerly Erwinia) chrysanthemi, an NIS synthetase involved in achromobactin biosynthesis. The structures of ATP and citrate complexes provide a mechanistic rationale for stereospecific formation of an enzyme-bound (3R)-citryladenylate, which reacts with L-serine to form a likely achromobactin precursor. AcsD is a unique acyladenylate-forming enzyme with a new fold and chemical catalysis strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2080028077,"Increased conformational flexibility is the prevailing explanation for the high catalytic efficiency of cold-adapted enzymes at low temperatures. However, less is known about the structural determinants of flexibility. We reported two novel cold-adapted zinc metalloproteases in the thermolysin family, vibriolysin MCP-02 from a deep sea bacterium and vibriolysin E495 from an Arctic sea ice bacterium, and compared them with their mesophilic homolog, pseudolysin from a terrestrial bacterium. Their catalytic efficiencies, kcat/Km (10–40 °C), followed the order pseudolysin < MCP-02 < E495 with a ratio of ∼1:2:4. MCP-02 and E495 have the same optimal temperature (Topt, 57 °C, 5 °C lower than pseudolysin) and apparent melting temperature (Tm = 64 °C, ∼10 °C lower than pseudolysin). Structural analysis showed that the slightly lower stabilities resulted from a decrease in the number of salt bridges. Fluorescence quenching experiments and molecular dynamics simulations showed that the flexibilities of the proteins were pseudolysin < MCP-02 < E495, suggesting that optimization of flexibility is a strategy for cold adaptation. Molecular dynamics results showed that the ordinal increase in flexibility from pseudolysin to MCP-02 and E495, especially the increase from MCP-02 to E495, mainly resulted from the decrease of hydrogen-bond stability in the dynamic structure, which was due to the increase in asparagine, serine, and threonine residues. Finally, a model for the cold adaptation of MCP-02 and E495 was proposed. This is the first report of the optimization of hydrogen-bonding dynamics as a strategy for cold adaptation and provides new insights into the structural basis underlying conformational flexibility.

This is the first report of the optimization of hydrogen-bonding dynamics as a strategy for cold adaptation and provides new insights into the structural basis underlying conformational flexibility. Cold-adapted enzymes, produced by organisms thriving in permanently cold habitats (deep sea, polar regions, and alpine regions), are characterized by high catalytic efficiencies at low temperatures and low stabilities at high temperatures (1Feller G.

Different enzymes may adopt different strategies for cold adaptation, e.g. optimization of flexibility (2Lonhienne T. Gerday C. Feller G. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 2004; 343: 1221-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The prevailing hypothesis is that cold-adapted enzymes obtain high catalytic efficiencies by increasing conformational flexibility at the expense of stability (4Georlette D. Blaise V. Collins T. D'Amico S. Gratia E. Hoyoux A. Marx J.C. Sonan G. Feller G. Gerday C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 28: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 9D'Amico S. Claverie P. Collins T. Georlette D.

The comparison of crystal structures has revealed some structural features that might be related to the cold adaptation of enzymes, including more non-branching or small residues, more asparagines, less arginines, more negative net charges, larger hydrophobic accessible surfaces, less salt bridges, and longer loops (3Siddiqui K.S. Cavicchioli R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 403-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 10Gianese G. Bossa F. Pascarella S. Proteins. 2002; 47: 236-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, less is currently known about how the conformational flexibility is determined by these features, because no structural feature is present in all cold-adapted enzymes, and no structural features consistently correlate with cold adaptation (3Siddiqui K.S. Cavicchioli R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 403-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Moreover, there are also reports about cold-adapted enzymes that possess both high activities and high stabilities (11Leiros H.K. Pey A.L. Innselset M. Moe E. Leiros I. Steen I.H. Martinez A. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28121-28125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Laboratory evolution studies also show that high catalytic efficiency and high stability could be obtained simultaneously in a single molecule (14Wintrode P.L. Miyazaki K. Arnold F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31635-31640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Miyazaki K. Wintrode P.L. Grayling R.A. Rubingh D.N. Arnold F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Therefore, further studies are needed to gain new insights into the structural basis underlying flexibility. The thermolysin family (M4) is a family of zinc metalloproteases in the MA(E) subclan of the MA clan (16Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes.2nd Ed. Elsevier Academic Press, London2004: 374-412Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All peptidases in this family contain a single catalytic zinc ion. This zinc ion is bonded by three ligands, the two histidines in the HEXXH motif and one glutamic acid beyond this motif. The glutamic acid in the HEXXH motif is the catalytic residue. The peptidases in this family are produced by bacteria from various habitats (16Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes.2nd Ed. Elsevier Academic Press, London2004: 374-412Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For example, thermolysin, the typical example of this family, is from the thermophilic bacterium Bacillus thermoproteolyticus, pseudolysin is from the mesophilic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, and a putative vibriolysin in this family is from the Antarctic bacterium strain 643 (vibriolysin E643). Vibriolysin E643 might be the only known enzyme in this family from a permanently cold habitat (17Adekoya O.A. Helland R. Willassen N.P. Sylte I. Proteins. 2006; 62: 435-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although its sequence has been deposited in a public database (GenBank™ accession number AF272770, NCBI accession number AAF78076), no biochemical data of this vibriolysin has been reported. In this report, two enzymes of the thermolysin family from permanently cold habitats are reported. The first enzyme, vibriolysin MCP-02, is an extracellular protease secreted by the deep sea bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913. MCP-02 was reported to be a mesophilic protease because of its high optimal temperature (Topt) 3The abbreviations used are: Topt, optimal temperature of activity; FAGLA, 3-(2-furylacryloyl)glycyl-l-leucine amide; HB, hydrogen bond; MD, molecular dynamics; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; r.m.s.f., root mean square fluctuation; Tm, melting temperature; AP, alkaline metalloprotease; PAP, psychrophilic alkaline metalloprotease. (18Chen X.L. Zhang Y.Z. Gao P.J. Luan X.W. Mar. Biol. 2003; 143: 989-993Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and further analysis in this report showed that it possesses some characteristics of cold-adapted enzymes. The second enzyme, vibriolysin E495, is an extracellular protease secreted by the Arctic sea ice bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM495. Analysis suggested that E495 has been optimized for higher catalytic efficiency at low temperatures than MCP-02. These two enzymes were compared with their mesophilic homolog, pseudolysin from P. aeruginosa PAO1. As shown in the results, these three enzymes made up a good system to study the structural basis underlying cold adaptation, because (i) the three enzymes are from typical habitats (terrestrial, deep sea, and Arctic) and the comparison of two enzymes at different cold-adaptation levels may provide more information than just comparing a cold-adapted enzyme with a mesophilic enzyme, and (ii) these three enzymes are highly homologous (identity between MCP-02 and E495 was ∼90%, and between MCP-02/E495 and pseudolysin was ∼60%), thus allowing an easy interpretation of the contributions of different structural features to cold adaptation. In the first part of this study, the sequences, catalytic properties and structural properties of MCP-02 and E495 are presented and compared with that of pseudolysin. In the second part, homology modeling and long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and systematic structural analysis of the three enzymes are reported to uncover the structural basis underlying the cold adaptation of deep sea MCP-02 and Arctic E495. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions-Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913 was cultured at 12 °C. Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM495 was isolated from a sea ice core sample 122–124 cm deep from the ice surface, which was taken from the Canadian Basin, Arctic Ocean (sampling site: 75°28′52″N 152°51′18″W) during the 2nd Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition, summer of 2003. Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM495 was cultured at 12 °C. The P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain was a generous gift from Yu Li-Yan (National Laboratory for Screening New Microbial Drugs, Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) and Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), China) and was grown at 30 °C. Escherichia coli DH5α and E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with ampicillin for the selection of transformants. Gene Cloning-Vibriolysin MCP-02 was purified from Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913 as described previously (18Chen X.L. Zhang Y.Z. Gao P.J. Luan X.W. Mar. Biol. 2003; 143: 989-993Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined using automated Edman degradation with PROCISE491 (Applied Biosystems). A 5′-terminal degenerate primer based on the N-terminal sequence and a 3′-terminal degenerate primer based on the conserved fragment of vibriolysin E643 (AF272770) were designed to clone the conserved sequence segment of the mcp-02 gene. The flanking sequences were amplified by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR as described previously (19Liu Y.-G. Whitter R.F. Genomics. 1995; 25: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). The full-length gene sequence was obtained by overlapping the amplified DNA fragments together. The mcp-02 gene was cloned from Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913 based on this full-length sequence and was sequenced again to ensure that a correct sequence was obtained. The nucleic acid sequence for the vibriolysin mcp-02 gene has been deposited in the GenBank™ data base under accession number EF029091. The amino acid sequence of this protein can be accessed through the NCBI Protein Database under NCBI accession number ABL06977. Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM495 was cultured at 12 °C in a seawater liquid medium as described before (18Chen X.L. Zhang Y.Z. Gao P.J. Luan X.W. Mar. Biol. 2003; 143: 989-993Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Vibriolysin E495 was obtained from the culture supernatant of Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM495 by ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography using a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences). Its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined using automated Edman degradation with PROCISE491 (Applied Biosystems). The gene sequence of vibriolysin E495 was obtained with the same method used for MCP-02. The nucleic acid sequence for the vibriolysin E495 gene has been deposited in the GenBank™ data base under accession number FJ211191. The amino acid sequence of this protein can be accessed through NCBI Protein Database under accession number ACI28452. Expression and Purification-The full-length genes of MCP-02, E495, and pseudolysin precursors were amplified by PCR with 5′ primers containing NdeI cleavage sites and 3′ primers, including XhoI cleavage sites. The amplification product was digested with the NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes and then cloned into the expression vector pET-22b (Novagen). The sequenced plasmid was introduced into the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. The induction conditions were 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 28 °C for 40 h for MCP-02, 0.02 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 20 °C for 20 h for E495, and 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C overnight for pseudolysin. Crude recombinant MCP-02 was obtained by direct addition of solid ammonium sulfate to the culture supernatant. Crude recombinant pseudolysin and recombinant E495 were obtained by disruption of the cells using sonication and then precipitation with solid ammonium sulfate. The crude proteins were then dialyzed and purified using a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer. The buffer pHs were 8.0 for MCP-02, 8.5 for E495, and 9.5 for pseudolysin. The proteins were eluted using a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.5 m. Fractions with high protease activities were collected, and purity was determined by 12.5% SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1). The fractions with purified enzyme were pooled together and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer to remove NaCl. The N-terminal sequences of the three purified recombinant proteases were confirmed by automated Edman degradation with PROCISE491 (Applied Biosystems). The molecular weights of the mature enzymes of MCP-02 and E495 were determined using mass spectrometry (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) method using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. Enzymatic Assays-Casein was used as the substrate for enzymatic activity assays as described (18Chen X.L. Zhang Y.Z. Gao P.J. Luan X.W. Mar. Biol. 2003; 143: 989-993Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All of the buffers used in the enzymatic assays, and spectral measurements were 50 mm Tris-HCl unless otherwise specified. Topt was determined in the range of 0 °C to 80 °C. The optimal pH was determined in the working range of Tris-HCl buffer, 7.0–9.0. For the determination of heat inactivation at 55 °C and 60 °C, the enzymes were incubated at the corresponding temperature for 15–120 min and then immediately placed on ice. The residual activities were determined at 55 °C. The dipeptide substrate 3-(2-furylacryloyl)glycyl-l-leucine amide (FAGLA) was purchased from Bachem A (Bubendorf, Switzerland). The concentrations of FAGLA were determined spectrophotometrically using ∈345 nm = 766 m-1cm-1 (20Feder J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity toward FAGLA was determined by measuring the decrease of absorbance at 345 nm (Δ∈345 = -317 m-1cm-1) with Feder’s method (20Feder J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The absorbance was monitored every 1 s for 10 min using a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer. The temperature was kept constant using a Julabo thermostat. The specific constant kcat/Km was determined using the following relationship: kcat/Km = v0/S0/E0, which is valid at S0 << Km. Fluorescence Measurements-The thermal unfolding curves were recorded with intrinsic fluorescence as a probe using a Jasco FP-6500 spectrofluorometer equipped with a Peltier computer-controlled thermostat. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the emission wavelength was 334 nm for pseudolysin and E495 and 337 nm for MCP-02. Both excitation and emission bandwidths were 3 nm. The temperature was scanned at a rate of 1 °C per min and was monitored using an external sensor. Cuvettes with a 1-cm path length were used. The protein concentrations were ∼5 μg/ml for MCP-02 and E495 and ∼10 μg/ml for pseudolysin. CD Measurements-The thermal unfolding curves were also recorded using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Julabo computer-controlled thermostat. The signal was recorded at 222 nm with a bandwidth of 2 nm. The temperature was monitored using an internal sensor, and the heating rate was 0.5 °C per min. A 0.1-cm path length cell was used. The protein concentration was ∼0.2 mg/ml. Dynamic Quenching of Fluorescence-The conformational flexibility was detected using dynamic fluorescence quenching experiments with acrylamide as the quencher. The samples were in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0), and the protein concentrations were ∼5 μg/ml for MCP-02 and E495 and ∼10 μg/ml for pseudolysin. Aliquots of the 1.2 m acrylamide stock solution were added to the 2.4-ml sample solution so that the acrylamide concentration increased by steps of ∼5 mm each. The sample was stirred for 30 s before the fluorescence was recorded. The fluorescence was monitored using a Jasco FP-6500 spectrofluorometer equipped with a Peltier computer-controlled thermostat. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the emission wavelength was 334 nm for pseudolysin and E495 and 337 nm for MCP-02. Both the excitation and emission bandwidths were 3 nm. The sensitivity was high, and the response time was 1 s. The experiments were carried out at 15 °C and 40 °C. The data were corrected because of the absorbance of the acrylamide (∈280 nm = 4.3 m-1 cm-1), according to Fcorr = Fobs10∈[Q]/2, where Fcorr is the corrected fluorescence intensity, Fobs the intensity observed in the presence of the quencher and [Q] the quencher concentration. The obtained data were fit to the Stern-Volmer equation F0/Fcorr = 1 + KSV[Q], where F0 is the fluorescence intensity obtained in the absence of the quencher, Fcorr the corrected fluorescence intensity, KSV the Stern-Volmer quenching constant, and [Q] the quencher concentration. Bioinformatics-Searches for sequences similar to MCP-02 and E495 were done with the BLAST tool available at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The conserved domains in the enzymes were analyzed using the Conserved Domain Database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml) (21Marchler-Bauer A. Anderson J.B. Derbyshire M.K. Weese-Scott C.

Homology Modeling and Quality Validation of Models-The homology models of MCP-02 and E495 were modeled using Modeler 9v2 (28Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2864-2871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For each protein, 1000 models of the catalytic domain without zinc and calcium were created and then were selected according to the objective function scores and the qualities of the models. The qualities of the models were checked using the SAVES server (nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES/) and PSQS server (www1.jcsg.org/psqs/). The models with low objective function scores and high quality scores were selected to model the ligands zinc and calcium. Then the model qualities were checked again using the SAVES server and PSQS server. Finally, one model for each protein, with both low objective function scores and high quality scores, was selected to be used as the starting structure for the following MD simulations. The quality scores of the selected structural models (Table 1) suggested that the models of MCP-02 and E495 were reliable.TABLE 1Quality scores of protein models calculated using the SAVES server (nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES/) and PSQS server (www1.jcsg.org/psqs/)ModelPseudolysinVirbriolysin MCP-02Vibriolysin E495ProCheckaRatio of residues in the core region of the Ramachandran plot89.4%88.9%89.8%Verify 3DbRatio of residues with an average three- to one-dimensional score >0.2100%100%100%ErratcRatio of residues with error value below the 95% rejection limit.

The models were then solvated in TIP3P water boxes with the solvate package in VMD. Next, the systems were neutralized by adding counter ions with the autoionize package in VMD. A cutoff distance of 9 Å for van der Waals interactions was assumed with a switching function starting at 7 Å. The non-bonded pair list distance was 11 Å. The SHAKE program was used to restrain the lengths of bonds involving hydrogen atoms to allow a time step of 2 fs for covalent bonds. Periodic boundary conditions were used with a flexible cell. The particle mesh Ewald method was used to compute long range electrostatic interactions, and the density of grid points was ≤1Å-3. The non-bonded pair list was updated every 20 steps.

Next, the temperature was increased gradually from 0 K to the final temperature (280 K or 310 K) in 5,000 steps with temperature assigned every 100 steps and with the Cα atoms under a harmonic constraint of 100 kcal mol-1 Å-2. Thereafter, the ensemble was equilibrated for four 5000-step cycles with decreasing harmonic constraints (100, 50, 10, and 1 kcal mol-1 Å-2) on the Cα atoms in each cycle. The final equilibration was carried out for 75,000 steps (i.e. 125 ps) without harmonic constraints. The final equilibrated conformations at each temperature were used as the starting point of the 30-ns Langevin dynamics simulations. A Langevin damping coefficient of 5 ps-1 was used during the equilibration and the final simulation. The ensemble was kept at 1 atm using a modified Nosé-Hoover method. In the simulation, the coordinates were saved every 5,000 time steps (i.e. 10 ps), and those of the last 15 ns were used in the hydrogen bond (HB) and salt bridge analyses. Analysis of Simulations-The analyses were conducted with the help of VMD. The backbone atoms of residues 2–298 for MCP-02 and E495 and 2–297 for pseudolysin were used in the following fitting procedures. For each trajectory, the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of the atomic positions of the backbone atoms was calculated. The average structure of the last 15-ns simulation was also calculated after the structure of each frame was fitted to the starting frame of the last 15-ns simulation. Then, each frame of the last 15-ns simulation was fitted to the average structure, and the root mean square fluctuation (r.m.s.f.) of the backbone atoms was calculated as an index of the flexibility for each residue. The average r.m.s.f. of all residues in the protein was used as an index of protein global flexibility. Structure Analysis-The HBs and salt bridges were detected for each frame of the last 15-ns simulation using self-written c codes. The HBs were detected following the HBPLUS (33McDonald I.K.

https://openalex.org/W2091606631,"Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) is one of the key transcriptional activators for nuclear-coded genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function as well as for many housekeeping genes. A transcriptional co-activator PGC-1 and its related family member PRC have previously been shown to interact with NRF-1 and co-activate NRF-1. We show here that NRF-1 can also directly interact with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and co-purify the PARP-1.DNA-PK.Ku80.Ku70.topoisomerase IIbeta-containing protein complex. Our in vitro binding experiments show that DNA-binding/dimerization domain of NRF-1 and the N-terminal half of PARP-1, which contains two Zinc fingers and the auto-modification domain, are responsible for the interaction, and that this interaction occurs with or without PARP-1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation). DNA-bound NRF-1 can form a complex with PARP-1, suggesting that NRF-1 can recruit the PARP-1.DNA-PK.Ku80.Ku70.topoisomerase IIbeta-containing protein complex to the promoter. PARP-1 can also PARylate the DNA-binding domain of NRF-1 and negatively regulate NRF-1.PARP-1 interaction. Transient transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that PARP-1 plays a role during transcriptional activation by NRF-1. Our finding identifies a new aspect of transcriptional regulation used by NRF-1."
https://openalex.org/W2060211169,"Proteolytic processing of defensins is a critical mode of posttranslational regulation of peptide activity. Because mouse α-defensin precursors are cleaved and activated by matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), we determined if additional defensin molecules, namely human neutrophil defensin pro-HNP-1 and β-defensins, are targets for MMP-7. We found that MMP-7 cleaves within the pro-domain of the HNP-1 precursor, a reaction that does not generate the mature peptide but produces a 59-amino acid intermediate. This intermediate, which retains the carboxyl-terminal end of the pro-domain, had antimicrobial activity, indicating that the residues important for masking defensin activity reside in the amino terminus of this domain. Mature HNP-1 was resistant to processing by MMP-7 unless the peptide was reduced and alkylated, demonstrating that only the pro-domain of α-defensins is normally accessible for cleavage by this enzyme. From the 47-residue HBD-1 precursor, MMP-7 catalyzed removal of 6 amino acids from the amino terminus. Neither a 39-residue intermediate form of HBD-1 nor the mature 36-residue form of HBD-1 was cleaved by MMP-7. In addition, both pro-HBD-2, with its shorter amino-terminal extension, and pro-HBD-3 were resistant to MMP-7. However, human and mouse β-defensin precursors that lack disulfide bonding contain a cryptic MMP-7-sensitive site within the mature peptide moiety. These findings support and extend accumulating evidence that the native three-dimensional structure of both α- and β-defensins protects the mature peptides against proteolytic processing by MMP-7. We also conclude that sites for MMP-7 cleavage are more common at the amino termini of α-defensin rather than β-defensin precursors, and that catalysis at these sites in α-defensin pro-domains results in acquisition of defensin activity.

Small, cationic peptides called defensins represent a major class of antimicrobial agent elaborated by cells of the innate immune system. Defensins are synthesized as precursors of 29 to 42 amino acid residues, of which six are conserved cysteine residues that form three intramolecular disulfide linkages (reviewed in Ref. 1Selsted M.E.

Mouse small intestine contains at least 20 distinct mRNAs for α-defensins, called cryptdins. The β-defensins (human β-defensins 1–4, or HBD-1 through -4, and mouse β-defensins 1–6, or mBD-1 through -6) are more widely expressed than the α peptides and are present in a variety of mucosal epithelium and tissues, including the upper airways, kidney and urogenital tract, and the colon (1Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Although both α- and β-defensins assume a β-sheet structure that is stabilized by disulfide bonding, the pattern of linkages between the cysteine residues differs. In addition, α-defensin precursors contain an amino-terminal pro-region that keeps most of them inactive until this region is proteolytically removed. Pro-HD-5 differs in that it has substantial activity against Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in vitro as a precursor (10Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D.

MMP-7 recognizes three sites within the 39-amino acid pro-domain (residues 19–58) of cryptdin precursors: the activating site (site 1) at the junction between the pro-segment and the mature peptide (Ser58↓Leu59), a second site (site 2) five residues upstream (Ala53↓Leu54), and a third site (site 3) in about the middle of the segment (Ser43↓Val/Ile44) (21Ayabe T.

As mentioned previously, β-defensins possess antimicrobial activity in their precursor forms, but amino-terminal processing of the constitutively expressed β-defensin HBD-1 produces intermediates with differences in bactericidal potency (11Valore E.V.

Although some of the peptide intermediates overlap with those generated by in vitro digestion of the HBD-1 precursor with chymotrypsin (29Zucht H.D. Grabowsky J. Schrader M. Liepke C. Jurgens M. Schulz-Knappe P. Forssmann W.G. Eur. J. Med. Res. 1998; 3: 315-323PubMed Google Scholar), it is not clear what proteases actually give rise to all amino-terminal-truncated forms. Furthermore, proteolysis of mouse β-defensins has not been examined. In this study, we have assessed if MMPs target neutrophil α-defensin precursors and β-defensins. We focused primarily on MMP-7, given its established role in processing and activation of mouse α-defensins and its expression in mucosal epithelium, particularly at sites of infection and inflammation. Reagents-Recombinant forms of the catalytic domain of human MMP-7 and human MMP-14 (MT1-MMP) were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). MMP-7 was also obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA) or generated in our laboratory using the bacterial expression plasmid pET23b+ (Novagen, Madison, WI) and purification procedures as described in Ref. 30Cha J. Pedersen M.V. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15831-15838Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar. In brief, cDNA encoding the catalytic domain of human MMP-7 was cloned into pET23b+ using the HindIII and NdeI sites. Large scale cultures of BL21(DE3) bacteria harboring the pET23b+-MMP-7 plasmid were lysed and MMP-7 purified from inclusion bodies solubilized in 6 m guanidine HCl, refolded by dialysis (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2, 20 μm ZnCl2, and 0.05% Brij-35), and subjected to heparin-agarose affinity chromatography. HNP-1 peptide was either purchased from Peptides International (Louisville, KY) or purified (see below). The 47-amino acid (full-length) form of HBD-1 was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ) and the 36-amino acid form from Peptides International. The cryptdin precursor procryptdin-His6 (also known as pro-CC) was purified as described in Ref. 22Shirafuji Y. Tanabe H. Satchell D.P. Henschen-Edman A. Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7910-7919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. Complete EDTA-free inhibitor was obtained from Roche and GelCode® Blue Stain Reagent from Pierce. Purification of Pro-HNP-1 and HNP-1-Recombinant pro-HNP-1 was produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified as described previously (25Valore E.V. Martin E. Harwig S.S. Ganz T. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1624-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). HNP-1 was purified from human neutrophil granule lysate as described elsewhere (31Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Szklarek D. Harwig S.S. Daher K. Bainton D.F. Lehrer R.I. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 76: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Expression of Pro-HNP-1 and MMP-7 in RAW264.7 Cells-Pro-HNP-1 cDNA was inserted into the BamHI site of the retroviral plasmid pBMN-IRES-Puro (32Garton K.J. Ferri N. Raines E.W. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 830-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The resulting construct was used for transfection (calcium phosphate method) of the Phoenix-A packaging cell line and production of recombinant amphotropic retrovirus as described previously (32Garton K.J. Ferri N. Raines E.W. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 830-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, retroviral supernatant was harvested and used to infect RAW264.7 cells for 9 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 mm HEPES, and 4 μg/ml Polybrene. Cells were selected and maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml puromycin. To generate the fusion constructs of the human MMP-7 catalytic domain with the pro-domain of MMP-14, we used a PCR-based gene SOEing strategy (33Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar) with MMP-7 and MMP-14 cDNAs as initial templates. The two primers used for amplification of sequences encoding the MMP-14 prepro-domain were: forward primer, 5′-GAA TTC GGC TGA CCC GGT GGT CTC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GCG CTT CCT TCG AAC ATT GGC-3′. Primers used for amplification of the human MMP-7 sequence were: forward primer, 5′-GCC AAT GTT CGA AGG AAG CGC TAC TCA CTA TTT CCA AAT AGC CCA-3′ (containing the reverse complement of the MMP-14 reverse primer) and reverse primer, 5′-GAG CTC CTC GCG CAA AGC C-3′. The resulting PCR products were then used as both templates and primers in a second PCR. The final PCR product was cloned using the TOPO TA pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). EcoRI and SacI restriction sites were used to replace the corresponding sequence in MMP-7 cDNA. To generate the Glu → Gln inactivating mutation, the gene SOEing technique was once again used. Primer set 1 included forward primer, 5′-GGA TCC GAA CAA TTG TCT CTG GAC GGC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-ATG GCC AAG TTG ATG AGT TGC A-3′, whereas primer set 2 included, forward primer, 5′-TGC AAC TCA TCA ACT TGG CCA T-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GAA TTC GTG TAT GTA ACA TTT ATT GAC ATC-3′ (mutated bases are underlined). The final product yields full-length cDNA (through poly(A) site) with BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites on the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively. Chimeric cDNA constructs were inserted into the pBMN-IRES-Blasta vector (with the puromycin resistance cassette replaced with blasticidin resistance cassette) using EcoRI. The vector was used to generate amphotropic virus for infection of RAW264.7 cells expressing pro-HNP-1 as described above. Blasticidin (Invitrogen) was used at 8 μg/ml for selection of MMP-7 positive cells. Expression and Purification of Recombinant HBD-1 and HBD-2 (His6-tagged and Non-tagged)-HBD-1 and -2 cDNAs in pBacPAK9 (Clontech) were transferred to pGEM-7Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI) using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. A carboxyl-terminal His6 tag was added to each by PCR amplification: for HBD-1, primers were 5′-GGA TCC TGA GTG TTG CCT GCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAA TTC TCA ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG CTT GCA GCA CTT GGC CTT CC-3′ (reverse), and for HBD-2, primers were 5′-GGA TCC GCT CCC AGC CAT CAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAA TTC TCA ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG TGG CTT TTT GCA GCA TTT TG-3′ (reverse). PCR products were cloned using the TOPO TA pCR4 vector (Invitrogen). Inserts with and without sequence encoding the His6 tag were excised using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites and subcloned into baculovirus expression vector pVL1393 (BD Pharmingen, La Jolla, CA). Vector DNA (5 μg) was transfected into Sf9 cells using the BaculoGold™ DNA system from Pharmingen. Recombinant baculovirus was amplified twice and used for a 4–5-day infection of High Five™ insect cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cells and conditioned medium were harvested and stored at –20 °C. Recombinant His6-tagged protein was purified from cell lysates as described previously (22Shirafuji Y. Tanabe H. Satchell D.P. Henschen-Edman A. Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7910-7919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) to bind and elute the His6 tag under denaturing conditions. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2. For purification of non-tagged defensins, High Five cell-conditioned medium was dialyzed against 12 liters of 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, several hours at 4 °C and then a fresh 4 liters overnight. Dialysate was filtered (0.22 μm) and applied to an SP-Sepharose column attached to aÄKTAFPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein was eluted with a NaCl gradient. Fractions were analyzed by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and GelCode® Blue staining. Appropriate fractions were pooled, concentrated using Centricon-3 ultrafiltration units (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and applied to a Superdex 75 HR/10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl. Fractions were collected by FPLC and purity (>95%) assessed by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and GelCode Blue staining. Expression and Purification of Recombinant His6-tagged Mouse β-Defensins-By PCR amplification, a His6 tag was added to the carboxyl terminus of mBD-1 cDNA using the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium clone number 517293 (generously provided by A. Ouellette) as a template, forward primer with sequence 5′-GGA TCC GGA CCC TGG CTG CCA CCA CTA-3′, and reverse primer with sequence 5′-GAA TTC TTA ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG GCT CTT ACA ACA GTT GGG CTT-3′. The cDNAs for mBD-2 and -3 were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR of RNA from kidney (mBD-2) or lung (mBD-3) isolated from mice 5 days after oral infection with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028s (a kind gift from Dr. Fred Heffron) as previously described (20Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared by pulverizing frozen tissue under LN2 and extracting with RNA-BEE (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). Mouse BD-2 primers were 5′-GAG TGC CCT TTC TAC CAG CCA T-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTT GAC TTC CAT GTG CTT CC-3′ (reverse), and mBD-3 primers were 5′-GCT TCA GTC ATG AGG ATC CAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCT AGG GAG CAC TTG TTT GCA-3′ (reverse). PCR products were cloned into the TOPO TA vector pCR4 (Invitrogen). These plasmids were used as templates to add sequence encoding a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag, as well as BamHI and EcoRI sites, by PCR: for mBD-2, the primers were 5′-GGA TTC TTC TAC TAC CAG CCA TGA GGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAA TTC TTA ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG TTT CAT GTA CTT GCA ACA GGG-3′ (reverse), and for mBD-3, the primers were 5′-GGA TCC GCT TCA GTC ATG AGG ATC C-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAA TTC TTA ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG TTT TCT CTT GCA GCA TTT GAG-3′ (reverse). After cloning into the TOPO TA vector pCR4, inserts were excised using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites (mBD-2) or solely EcoRI (mBD-3) and subcloned into pVL1393 for baculovirus expression as described above for HBD-1 and -2. Recombinant protein was purified from cell lysates using denaturing nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography followed by dialysis and gel filtration chromatography on the Superdex 75 column. Reduction and Alkylation of Defensins-We employed volatile reducing and alkylating agents in a method described by Hale et al. (34Hale J.E. Butler J.P. Gelfanova V. You J.S. Knierman M.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 333: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Reducing/alkylating reagent (97.5% acetonitrile, 2% iodoethanol, and 0.5% triethylphosphine) was prepared under nitrogen in an AtmosBag glove bag (Sigma). Peptides in 0.01% acetic acid (22.5–40 μg in 45 μl) were treated with 5 μl of 1 m ammonium carbonate, pH 11, and 50 μl of reducing/alkylating reagent for 1 h at 37 °C. Reagent was allowed to evaporate in a fume hood. Peptides were dissolved in 0.01% acetic acid and analyzed by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and GelCode Blue staining, then used for cleavage reactions. Cleavage Reactions-Defensin peptides were incubated with an equal mass or less of active recombinant human MMP-7 catalytic domain in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 for 18–24 h at 37 °C. For calculation of enzyme-to-substrate molar ratios, we used molecular weights provided by the manufacturer (for commercial peptides) or determined from the ExPASy proteomics server (ca.expasy.org). Digests were resolved by Tris-Tricine gel (15% polyacrylamide) electrophoresis and bands were visualized using GelCode Blue staining reagent. For amino-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation, the mass of the defensin was in 2–3-fold excess over that of MMP-7. Digests were separated by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and transferred to mini-ProBlott polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Western Blotting-To assess cleavage of HBD-1 or pro-HNP-1, in vitro cleavage reactions or conditioned medium were separated by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using semi-dry electrophoresis (Bio-Rad). To detect pro-HNP-1, membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) plus 2% ECL Advance™ Blocking Agent (GE Healthcare). The primary antibody, a goat polyclonal raised against the carboxyl terminus of HNP (catalogue number sc-22916, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), was used at 1:2000 in the same buffer used for blocking. After washing in TBST, blots were incubated with a 1:50,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody in blocking buffer and developed using ECL Advance reagents (GE Healthcare). For HBD-1, blots were blocked with 10% nonfat milk in TBST and incubated with an anti-HBD-1 antibody we prepared in rabbits and diluted 1:2000 in TBST plus 5% milk, followed by a 1:5000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody in the same diluent. Blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (1.25 mm Luminol, 0.198 mm p-coumaric acid, 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 0.00875% H2O2). For MMP-7 immunoblotting, conditioned medium was separated by standard SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. We used a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the amino terminus of human MMP-7 (catalogue number AB8118, Chemicon) at 1:5000 and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit at 1:15,000. Phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and 5% milk was used as the blocking buffer and antibody diluent, and PBST with 0.5% milk was used for washes. Blots were developed with ECL Advance reagents. Gel Overlay Antibacterial Assay-We used a method described in Lehrer et al. (35Lehrer R.I. Rosenman M. Harwig S.S. Jackson R. Eisenhauer P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 137: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) to assess the antimicrobial activity of MMP-7-cleaved defensin precursors. Cleavage reactions were performed as described above, then lyophilized and dissolved in 5 μl of sample buffer containing 3 m urea, 5% acetic acid, and methyl green as a dye indicator. Mini-gels containing 12.5% polyacrylamide and polymerized with urea and acetic acid were pre-run at 150 V for 1 h in 5% acetic acid. Samples were applied in duplicate to the gels and electrophoresed (in + to – direction) for 45 min under the same conditions. Half of each gel was fixed in 50% methanol, 7% acetic acid, and 5% formaldehyde for 15 min. After washing in water for three times, 5 min each, the gel was stained with GelCode Blue. The other half of each gel was washed twice in 200 ml of 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 15 min each. Although gels were running, the underlay agar was prepared as follows: from a stationary phase liquid culture of the defensin-sensitive strain of Salmonella (MS7953s, a phoP7953::Tn10 derivative of the virulent strain 14028s and a kind gift from Dr. Fred Heffron), 250 μl was used to inoculate 25 ml of tryptic soy broth containing tetracycline (10 μg/ml). Bacteria were grown for 1 h, 15 min to exponential phase (A600 = 0.23), pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 19 ml of PIPES buffer. Fifty μl of this suspension was added to 10 ml of molten (45 °C) underlay agar: 1% agarose (A-6013, Sigma), 0.03% tryptic soy broth, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4. This mixture was poured into 100 mm × 100-mm square Petri dishes. Washed gels were placed on solidified underlay agar and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Gels were then removed and 10 ml of molten overlay agar (1% agarose, 6% tryptic soy broth) added. After solidification, plates were inverted and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Gels were stained with 0.002% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 27% methanol, 5.5% formaldehyde, for 24 h, rinsed 1 h in 10% acetic acid containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide, and dried between two sheets of cellophane. Cleavage of Pro-HNP-1 by MMP-7-One major 56-residue intermediate and several shorter, minor intermediate forms of amino-terminal processed pro-HNP-1, as well as the 29- and 30-residue mature peptides (Fig. 1A), have been identified in peripheral blood neutrophils and promyelocytic cell lines (23Harwig S.S.

https://openalex.org/W2097525661,"Terpene synthases are a family of enzymes largely responsible for synthesizing the vast array of terpenoid compounds known to exist in nature. Formation of terpenoids from their respective 10-, 15-, or 20-carbon atom prenyl diphosphate precursors is initiated by divalent (M(2+)) metal ion-assisted electrophilic attack. In addition to M(2+), monovalent cations (M(+)) have also been shown to be essential for the activity of certain terpene synthases most likely by facilitating substrate binding or catalysis. An apple alpha-farnesene synthase (MdAFS1), which has a dependence upon potassium (K(+)), was used to identify active site regions that may be important for M(+) binding. Protein homology modeling revealed a surface-exposed loop (H-alphal loop) in MdAFS1 that fulfilled the necessary requirements for a K(+) binding region. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis of specific residues within this loop then revealed their crucial importance to this K(+) response and strongly implicated specific residues in direct K(+) binding. The role of the H-alphal loop in terpene synthase K(+) coordination was confirmed in a Conifer pinene synthase also using site-directed mutagenesis. These findings provide the first direct evidence for a specific M(+) binding region in two functionally and phylogenetically divergent terpene synthases. They also provide a basis for understanding K(+) activation in other terpene synthases and establish a new role for the H-alphal loop region in terpene synthase catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2023004166,"Kainate receptors are a class of ionotropic glutamate receptors that have a role in the modulation of glutamate release and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal formation. Previous studies have implicated corticosteroids in the regulation of these receptors and recent clinical work has shown that polymorphisms in kainate receptor subunit genes are associated with susceptibility to major depression and response to anti-depressant treatment. In the present study we sought to examine the effects of chronic stress and corticosteroid treatments upon the expression of the mRNA of kainate receptor subunits GluR5-7 and KA1-2. Our results show that, after 7 days, adrenalectomy results in increased expression of hippocampal KA1, GluR6 and GluR7 mRNAs, an effect which is reversed by treatment with corticosterone in the case of KA1 and GluR7 and by aldosterone treatment in the case of GluR6. 21 days of chronic restraint stress (CRS) elevated the expression of the KA1 subunit, but had no effect on the expression of the other subunits. Similarly, 21 days of treatment with a moderate dose of corticosterone also increased KA1 mRNA in the dentate gyrus, whereas a high corticosterone dose has no effect. Our results suggest an interaction between hippocampal kainate receptor composition and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and show a selective chronic stress induced modulation of the KA1 subunit in the dentate gyrus and CA3 that has implications for stress-induced adaptive structural plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1991906846,"Because of the limited processing capacity of eyes, retinal networks must adapt constantly to best present the ever changing visual world to the brain. However, we still know little about how adaptation in retinal networks shapes neural encoding of changing information. To study this question, we recorded voltage responses from photoreceptors (R1-R6) and their output neurons (LMCs) in the Drosophila eye to repeated patterns of contrast values, collected from natural scenes. By analyzing the continuous photoreceptor-to-LMC transformations of these graded-potential neurons, we show that the efficiency of coding is dynamically improved by adaptation. In particular, adaptation enhances both the frequency and amplitude distribution of LMC output by improving sensitivity to under-represented signals within seconds. Moreover, the signal-to-noise ratio of LMC output increases in the same time scale. We suggest that these coding properties can be used to study network adaptation using the genetic tools in Drosophila, as shown in a companion paper (Part II)."
https://openalex.org/W2034273091,"Extremes of electrocardiographic QT interval are associated with increased risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD); thus, identification and characterization of genetic variants that modulate QT interval may elucidate the underlying etiology of SCD. Previous studies have revealed an association between a common genetic variant in NOS1AP and QT interval in populations of European ancestry, but this finding has not been extended to other ethnic populations. We sought to characterize the effects of NOS1AP genetic variants on QT interval in the multi-ethnic population-based Dallas Heart Study (DHS, n = 3,072). The SNP most strongly associated with QT interval in previous samples of European ancestry, rs16847548, was the most strongly associated in White (P = 0.005) and Black (P = 3.6 x 10(-5)) participants, with the same direction of effect in Hispanics (P = 0.17), and further showed a significant SNP x sex-interaction (P = 0.03). A second SNP, rs16856785, uncorrelated with rs16847548, was also associated with QT interval in Blacks (P = 0.01), with qualitatively similar results in Whites and Hispanics. In a previously genotyped cohort of 14,107 White individuals drawn from the combined Atherosclerotic Risk in Communities (ARIC) and Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) cohorts, we validated both the second locus at rs16856785 (P = 7.63 x 10(-8)), as well as the sex-interaction with rs16847548 (P = 8.68 x 10(-6)). These data extend the association of genetic variants in NOS1AP with QT interval to a Black population, with similar trends, though not statistically significant at P<0.05, in Hispanics. In addition, we identify a strong sex-interaction and the presence of a second independent site within NOS1AP associated with the QT interval. These results highlight the consistent and complex role of NOS1AP genetic variants in modulating QT interval."
https://openalex.org/W1983441569,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae MPH1 was first identified as a gene encoding a 3′ to 5′ DNA helicase, which when deleted leads to a mutator phenotype. In this study, we isolated MPH1 as a multicopy suppressor of the dna2K1080E helicase-negative lethal mutant. Purified Mph1 stimulated the endonuclease activities of both Fen1 and Dna2, which act faithfully in the processing of Okazaki fragments. This stimulation required neither ATP hydrolysis nor the helicase activity of Mph1. Multicopy expression of MPH1 also suppressed the temperature-sensitive growth defects in cells expressing dna2Δ405N, which lacks the N-terminal 405 amino acids of Dna2. However, Mph1 did not stimulate the endonuclease activity of the Dna2Δ405N mutant protein. The stimulation of Fen1 by Mph1 was limited to flap-structured substrates; Mph1 hardly stimulated the 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity of Fen1. Mph1 binds to flap-structured substrate more efficiently than to nicked duplex structures, suggesting that the stimulatory effect of Mph1 is exerted through its binding to DNA substrates. In addition, we found that Mph1 reversed the inhibitory effects of replication protein A on Fen1 activity. Our biochemical and genetic data indicate that the in vivo suppression of Dna2 defects observed with both dna2K1080E and dna2Δ405N mutants occur via stimulation of Fen1 activity. These findings suggest that Mph1 plays an important, although not essential, role in processing of Okazaki fragments by facilitating the formation of ligatable nicks.

This series of reactions leads to a polymerase switch in which the pol α-primase complex at primer ends is displaced and replaced by pol δ. Okazaki fragments are then elongated by pol δ until they encounter downstream Okazaki fragments (2Hübscher U. Seo Y.S. Mol. Cells.. 2001; 12: 149-157Google Scholar, 8Maga G. Frouin I. Spadari S.

Biol. Chem... 2009; 284: 4041-4045Google Scholar). These flaps are then cleaved by structure-specific nucleases that lead to the generation of ligatable nicks, which are sealed by DNA ligase converting the noncontiguous lagging strands to a contiguous DNA chain (12Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2004; 73: 589-615Google Scholar, 13Turchi J.J. Huang L. Murante R.S. Kim Y. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A number of biochemical studies have shown that flap structures are removed by the concerted action of Dna2 endonuclease/helicase and Fen1 (flap endonuclease 1) (14Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S.

DNA2, first identified as a gene that complemented a yeast temperature-sensitive mutant defective in the elongation stage of DNA replication, was shown to encode a protein with structure-specific endonuclease and 5′ to 3′ helicase activities (17Kuo C.L.

RAD27, encoding yeast Fen1, is a gene showing strong mutator phenotype and genome instability when inactivated. Fen1 participates in a variety of DNA transactions, including Okazaki fragment processing, due to its endonuclease, gap endonuclease, and exonuclease activities (12Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu.

Fen1 can cleave flap structures efficiently to generate ligatable nicks, especially on short 5′ flap structures (<20 nt). However, Fen1 is not effective in cleaving replication protein A (RPA) bound or secondary structured flaps in vitro (14Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature.. 2001; 412: 456-461Google Scholar, 29Spiro C. Pelletier R. Rolfsmeier M.L. Dixon M.J. Lahue R.S. Gupta G. Park M.S. Chen X. Mariappan S.V. McMurray C.T. Mol. Cell... 1999; 4: 1079-1085Google Scholar). These findings suggest that in vivo Fen1 acts on flap DNA by first loading onto the 5′-ends of flap structures and then migrating to the junction of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), a process referred to as a ""tracking mechanism"" (30Liu Y. Zhang H. Veeraraghavan J. Bambara R.A. Freudenreich C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2004; 24: 4049-4064Google Scholar). In contrast, Dna2 can remove secondary structured flaps through the combined action of its helicase/endonuclease activities; its helicase activity can unwind intramolecular base-paired hairpin-like flap structures, thus facilitating the cleavage of unwound ssDNA through its endonuclease activity. RPA can also assist in the removal of relatively long DNA flaps by Dna2 (14Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature.. 2001; 412: 456-461Google Scholar). RPA, which can bind to long flaps (>27 nt), inhibits the action of Fen1 in vitro while stimulating the Dna2-catalyzed cleavage of long flap by recruiting Dna2 (14Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature.. 2001; 412: 456-461Google Scholar). Thus, RPA is dynamically removed by Dna2 and then Fen1 cleaves the remaining flaps (15Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 1618-1625Google Scholar, 31Bae K.H. Kim H.S. Bae S.H. Kang H.Y. Brill S. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res... 2003; 31: 3006-3015Google Scholar). The Pif1 5′ to 3′ helicase activity is implicated in accelerating the growth of long flap structures by rapidly displacing downstream 5′ flap, thereby increasing the chances that RPA can bind before Fen1 acts (33Rossi M.L. Pike J.E. Wang W. Burgers P.M. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 27483-27493Google Scholar). These considerations indicate that Dna2 and Fen1 remove flap structures by their sequential action, and their activities are influenced by other proteins like RPA and Pif1. Saccharomyces cerevisiae MPH1 was first identified as a mutator phenotype 1 gene (34Entian K.D. Schuster T. Hegemann J.H. Becher D. Feldmann H. Güldener U. Götz R. Hansen M. Hollenberg C.P. Jansen G. Kramer W. Klein S. Kötter P. Kricke J. Launhardt H. Mannhaupt G. Maierl A. Meyer P. Mewes W. Munder T. Niedenthal R.K. Ramezani Rad M. Röhmer A. Römer A. Hinnen A. Mol. Gen. Genet... 1999; 262: 683-702Google Scholar), and the mph1Δ null mutant displayed increased mutation rates and sensitivity to a variety of DNA-damaging agents (35Scheller J. Schürer A. Rudolph C. Hettwer S. Kramer W. Genetics.. 2000; 11: 61-73Google Scholar). Based on genetic studies, it is thought that MPH1 functions in an error-free DNA damage bypass pathway that requires homologous recombination genes (36Schürer K.A. Rudonph C. Ulrich H.D. Kramer W. Genetics.. 2004; 166: 1673-1686Google Scholar). It was also shown that Mph1 has DNA-dependent ATPase activity and translocates on ssDNA in the 3′ to 5′ direction (37Prakash R. Krejci L. Van Komen S. Anke Schürer K. Kramer W. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 7854-7860Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that overexpression of Mph1 increased gross chromosomal rearrangements by partially inhibiting homologous recombination through its interaction with RPA (38Banerjee S. Smith S. Oum J.H. Liaw H.J. Hwang J.Y. Sikdar N. Motegi A. Lee S.E. Myung K. J. Cell Biol... 2008; 181: 1083-1093Google Scholar). These data suggest that Mph1 is important in maintaining the integrity of DNA. In addition to the proteins described above, the processing of Okazaki fragment is affected by other proteins that stimulate the endonucleases that cleave flap structures. Mgs1, which has DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA-annealing activities, markedly stimulates the endonuclease activity of Fen1 on flap DNA substrates in an ATP-dependent manner (39Kim J.H. Kang Y.H. Kang H.J. Kim D.H. Ryu G.H. Kang M.J. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res... 2005; 33: 6137-6150Google Scholar). Bloom and Werner helicases interact directly with hFen1 and stimulate its endonuclease activity (40Sharma S. Sommers J.A. Wu L. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Brosh Jr. R.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 9844-9856Google Scholar, 41Brosh R.M. Jr., von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotorowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J... 2001; 20: 5791-5801Google Scholar). The detection of auxiliary proteins that stimulate the activities of Dna2 or Fen1 is likely to reveal important redundant pathways involved in the processing of Okazaki fragments. Moreover, their discovery may reveal novel pathways used to maintain genome integrity, since DNA replication is closely linked to genome stability. In order to identify novel factors that influence Okazaki fragment processing, we have carried out multicopy suppressor screens with dna2 helicase-negative mutant strains. We introduced multicopy plasmids containing randomly inserted genomic DNA fragments into the dna2K1080E mutant yeast strain and analyzed the inserts that suppressed the lethal phenotype of this mutant. This screen resulted in the identification of MPH1 as a multicopy suppressor. To understand the biochemical mechanism of their suppression and its role in Okazaki fragment processing, we purified the Mph1 protein and investigated its interactions with Fen1 and Dna2 both in vivo and in vitro. We found that Mph1 enhanced the endonuclease activities of Fen1 and Dna2 in vitro, and this stimulation did not require ATPase/helicase activities of Mph1. Our results indicate that Mph1 participates in Okazaki fragment processing by increasing the rate of cleavage of flap substrate, thereby facilitating the production of ligatable nicks. Enzymes and Nucleotides—The restriction endonucleases, polynucleotide kinase, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Enzynomics (Daejeon, Korea). The oligonucleotides used in this study were commercially synthesized from Genotech (Daejeon, Korea). ATP was obtained from Sigma. ATPγS was from Roche Applied Science. [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Izotop (Budapest, Hungary). Yeast Dna2 and Fen1 were purified as described (14Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature.. 2001; 412: 456-461Google Scholar, 42Bae S.H. Kim J.A. Choe E. Lee K.H. Kang H.Y. Kim H.D. Kim J.H. Bae K.H. Cho Y. Park C. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res... 2001; 29: 3069-3079Google Scholar). Preparation of Helicase and Nuclease Substrates—All substrates were prepared as described previously (14Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature.. 2001; 412: 456-461Google Scholar), and the sequences of oligonucleotides used are listed in Table 1. Briefly, one of the two oligonucleotides in a partial duplex DNA substrate was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's protocol and then annealed to the other oligonucleotide. For a flap or a nicked duplex substrate, a downstream oligonucleotide was labeled as described above and then annealed with the template and upstream oligonucleotides at a molar ratio of 1:3:5. All annealed substrates were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Table 1Oligonucleotide sequences used in this study Number Sequence (5′-3′) 1 GGGCTCACGTGGTCGACGCTGGAGGTGATCACCAGATGATTGCTAGGCATGCTTTCCGCAAGAGAACGGGCGTCTGCGTACCCGTGCAG (89 nt)aThe numbers in parentheses indicate the length of each oligonucleotide. 2 CAGCGTCGACCACGTGAGCCC (21 nt) 3 CTGCACGGGTACGCAGACGCC (21 nt) 4 CGAACAATTCAGCGGCTTTAACCGGACGCTCGACGCCATTAATAATGTTTTC (52 nt) 5 GAAAACATTATTAATGGCGTCGAGCTAGGCACAAGGCGAACTGCTAACGG (50 nt) 6 CCGTTAGCAGTTCGCCTTGTGCCTA (25 nt) 7 CCGTTAGCAGTTCGCCTTGTGCCTAG (26 nt) 8bUnderlined sequences form hairpin structures.

Open table in a new tab Construction of Mph1 Expression Vectors—For overexpression of Mph1 in yeast, the ADH1 promoter was used. This was PCR-amplified from pRS323(ADH)-FLAG using two oligonucleotides (5′-TCC CCG CGG GAT ATC CTT TTG TTT CCG GG-3′ and 5′-GGC CGC GGC CGC GAG TTG ATT GTA TGC TTG GTA-3′), and the SacII-NotI fragment of the PCR product was cloned into pRS325 and pRS424 plasmids to prepare pRS325(ADH) and pRS424(ADH), respectively. The open reading frame of MPH1 was amplified from a plasmid containing MPH1 using two oligonucleotides (5′-GCG GCC GCA TGG CTA GTG CAG ATG ATT A-3′ and 5′-CTG CAG TCA AAA ATC AGA ATC TGA GC-3′). The NotI-PstI fragment of the PCR fragment was cloned into pRS325(ADH) to obtain pRS325(ADH)-MPH1. The NotI-PstI fragment from pRS325(ADH)-MPH1 was subcloned to pRS424(ADH) to make pRS424(ADH)-MPH1. To express hexahistidine and the FLAG-tagged Mph1, pRS424(ADH) was digested first with ClaI, and the resulting recessed ends were filled in with Klenow and then digested with KpnI. Similarly, pFastBac-Hta-FLAG-MPH1 (see below) was digested with RsrII, and the recessed end was filled in with Klenow, followed by digestion with KpnI. The fragment containing His6-FLAG-MPH1 was cloned into the digested pRS424(ADH)vector, resulting in pRS424(ADH)-HF-MPH1. For construction of a vector expressing the His6-FLAG-tagged protein in insect cells, two oligonucleotides containing the FLAG peptide sequence (5′-TCG ACT TGA CTA CAA GGA CGA TGA CGA TAA GAG C-3′ and 5′-GGC CGC TCT TAT CGT CAT CGT CCT TGT AGT CAA G-3′) were annealed, and the products were cloned into pFastBac-HTa vector, resulting in pFastBac-Hta-FLAG. pFastBac-Hta-FLAG-MPH1 was made by cloning the NotI-Kpn1 fragment of the PCR product amplified from pET28-MPH1 using 5′-GCG CGG CCG CAT GGC TAG TGC AGA TGA TTA C-3′ and 5′-GCG GTA CCT CAA AAA TCA GAA TCT GAG CC-3′. To make the mph1K113E mutant DNA, in vitro mutagenesis was carried out using the EZchange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Enzynomics) using the oligonucleotides (5′-GCC ATC CCA ACG GGT ATG GGT GAA ACG TTC ATT GCC AG-3′ and 5′-CTG GCA ATG AAC GTT TCA CCC ATA CCC GTT GGG ATG GC-3′), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Screening Multicopy Suppressors of dna2K1080E Mutant—A yeast genomic DNA library inserted into a pYEp13 multicopy plasmid (ATCC27323) was transformed into YJA1B (MATα ade2-101 ura3-52 lys2-801trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 GAL+ dna2::HIS3 (pRS316-DNA2)) containing the pRS314-dna2K1080E plasmid. Transformants were grown in SD without histidine, leucine, and tryptophan for 24 h at 30 °C, followed by replica plating onto the same SD medium supplemented with 0.1% 5-fluoroorotic acid. The plates were incubated for an additional 3–4 days. The colonies grown were transferred to liquid medium, and total genomic DNA was prepared and used to transform Escherichia coli by electroporation, from which plasmids were isolated. To confirm multicopy suppression, recovered plasmids were retransformed into the YJA1B strain and examined for their ability to support growth of mutant cells. Double-checked plasmids were analyzed by sequencing to identify genomic DNA fragments inserted in the plasmid. One of the analyzed plasmids contained the MPH1 gene. To confirm that MPH1 is a multicopy suppressor, the open reading frame of MPH1 alone was cloned into a 2-μm origin-based pRS plasmid series and expressed under the ADH1 promoter in mutant cells. Drop Dilution Assay—Transformants were inoculated in appropriate medium (2 ml) and grown for 16–36 h. Each saturated culture was diluted with distilled water to a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml, and serially diluted samples (5–10 μl) were then spotted on appropriate medium and incubated for 3–5 days at the indicated temperatures. Where 5-fluoroorotic acid and control plate were used, inoculation was performed in the medium containing uracil to allow cells to spontaneously lose pRS316-Dna2 (containing the URA3 gene as a marker) during growth before spotting (35Scheller J. Schürer A. Rudolph C. Hettwer S. Kramer W. Genetics.. 2000; 11: 61-73Google Scholar, 39Kim J.H. Kang Y.H. Kang H.J. Kim D.H. Ryu G.H. Kang M.J. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res... 2005; 33: 6137-6150Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant Mph1 Proteins—Baculoviruses expressing the N-terminally histidine-FLAG-tagged Mph1 protein (wild type or K113E mutant) were used to infect Sf9 insect cells (2 liters; 1 × 106 cells/ml) for 60 h at 27 °C in Sf-900 II serum-free medium (Invitrogen); cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml anti-pain, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), and sonicated. Crude extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 1 h using the Hanil A50S-8 rotor, and the supernatant was mixed with 0.5 ml of anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) pre-equilibrated with the lysis buffer for 2 h. The beads were collected and washed three times with 40 ml of buffer A (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) containing 800 mm NaCl and once with buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted three times with 0.5 ml of buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl and 0.1 mg/ml 1× FLAG peptide (Sigma) with rocking at 4 °C for 30 min. The initial two eluates were combined and loaded onto a Heparin-Sepharose Fast Flow column (3 ml; GE Healthcare) by gravity, followed by elution with a 6-ml linear gradient of NaCl from 0.1 to 1 m in buffer A (flow rate, 0.1 ml/min). Mph1 was eluted in 550–750 mm NaCl. BSA was added to the active fractions (final concentration, 1 mg/ml) to stabilize the enzyme, which was then frozen at –80 °C. The protein concentrations of Mph1 fractions were quantified by SDS-PAGE analysis, followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and the protein band intensity was determined using BSA as the standard (Bio-Rad). Nuclease Assay and Helicase Assay—Standard nuclease assays of Fen1 and Dna2 were performed in reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, and 15 fmol of DNA substrate. Unless stated otherwise, 50 mm NaCl was used for each reaction. Proteins were diluted in buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) before their addition to reaction mixtures. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and halted with 6× stop solution (60 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 40% (w/v) sucrose, 0.6% SDS, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 0.25% bromphenol blue). Reaction products were subjected to electrophoresis for 40 min at 150 V through 10% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE (89 mm Tris-base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA); gels were dried on DEAE-cellulose paper and autoradiographed. The resolved DNA products were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Helicase assays were performed using the same conditions as described in the above nuclease assay but in the presence of 5 mm ATP. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 15 fmol of DNA substrate with or without 5 mm MgCl2 and with or without 5 mm ATP (or ATPγS) were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, followed by the addition of glycerol and bromphenol blue to 10% (v/v) and 0.05% (w/v), respectively. Reaction products were subjected to electrophoresis through prerun 6% polyacrylamide gels for 1.5 h in 0.5× TBE at 4 °C (39Kim J.H. Kang Y.H. Kang H.J. Kim D.H. Ryu G.H. Kang M.J. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res... 2005; 33: 6137-6150Google Scholar). Gels were dried on DEAE-cellulose paper and then autoradiographed. Levels of nucleoprotein complexes formed were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Overexpression of MPH1 Suppresses the Lethal Phenotype of dna2K1080E—To identify novel factors involved in Okazaki fragment processing, extensive multicopy suppressor screens were carried out with several dna2 mutant strains. The mutant strains used were defective in the processing of DNA flap structures generated from 5′-end regions of Okazaki fragments in the pol δ-catalyzed displacement reaction. The rationale for this screen was that it might reveal additional proteins that participate in Okazaki fragment maturation by (i) replacing one of the defective activities of Dna2, (ii) stimulating the flap-cleaving enzymes, including Dna2 and Fen1, or (iii) repairing DNA structures resulting from defects in flap processing. Multicopy suppressor screens were performed with the helicase-negative dna2K1080E mutant in the hope of isolating a helicase gene that could substitute for the helicase function of Dna2. This effort resulted in the isolation of one clone that harbored a library plasmid containing the full-length open reading frame of the MPH1 gene. To confirm that MPH1 was responsible for suppression, the open reading frame of MPH1 was amplified from the library plasmid and positioned under the constitutive promoter of the gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1) in the pRS325 multicopy vector (pRS325pADH-MPH1) and expressed in the dna2K1080E mutant strain. Overexpression of MPH1 driven by either the ADH1 promoter or its natural promoter suppressed the lethal phenotype of dna2K1080E (Fig. 1A). Since the Mph1 protein has intrinsic ATPase and 3′ to 5′ DNA helicase activities, we examined whether they were required for the observed suppression (37Prakash R. Krejci L. Van Komen S. Anke Schürer K. Kramer W. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 7854-7860Google Scholar). For this purpose, we mutated lysine 113 to glutamic acid in the Walker A motif of MPH1 that is responsible for binding to the terminal phosphate of ATP (35Scheller J. Schürer A. Rudolph C. Hettwer S. Kramer W. Genetics.. 2000; 11: 61-73Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of the mutated version of MPH1 also suppressed the lethality of dna2K1080E, as observed with the wild type MPH1. This result suggests that the helicase activity of Mph1 is dispensable for suppression of the dna2K1080E mutation. To gain more information about the mechanism by which MPH1 suppressed DNA2 mutated strain, we isolated the recombinant Mph1 protein. Its expression in E. coli resulted in mostly insoluble and severely degraded protein preparations. For this reason, recombinant baculoviruses were prepared that expressed Mph1 with N-terminally fused His6 and FLAG tags and were used to infect Sf9 cells. Extracts prepared from infected insect cells yielded soluble recombinant HF-Mph1 protein after two column purification steps (Fig. 1B), as described under ""Experimental Procedures."" The recombinant Mph1 protein possessed helicase activity on partial double strand substrates with a 3′ single-stranded DNA but not with a 5′ single-stranded DNA (Fig. 1C), consistent with the previous report that Mph1 purified from yeast translocates in the 3′ to 5′ direction (37Prakash R. Krejci L. Van Komen S. Anke Schürer K. Kramer W. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 7854-7860Google Scholar). Mph1 Stimulates the Endonuclease Activity of Fen1—RPA and Mgs1, both identified as multicopy suppressors of dna2 mutants, markedly stimulated the endonuclease activity of Dna2 and Fen1, respectively (14Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature.. 2001; 412: 456-461Google Scholar, 39Kim J.H. Kang Y.H. Kang H.J. Kim D.H. Ryu G.H. Kang M.J. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res... 2005; 33: 6137-6150Google Scholar). To investigate whether Mph1 utilized a similar mechanism, we examined the structure-specific nuclease activity of Fen1 in the absence (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–7) or presence (Fig. 2A, lanes 8–12) of Mph1 in a time course experiment (Fig. 2, A and B). Mph1 markedly enhanced the activity of Fen1 when a 27-nt 5′ flap substrate was used (Fig. 2A). The purified Mph1 protein alone was devoid of any nuclease activity (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Maximal stimulation (15.3-fold) was observed at the earliest time point examined (Fig. 2B). If Mph1 suppressed the lethality of dna2K1080E solely by stimulating the action of Fen1, we would expect that overexpression of FEN1 should suppress the dna2K1080E mutant. As predicted, multicopy expression of FEN1 suppressed the dna2K1080E mutant (Fig. 2C, second row). Since it is possible that the presence of affinity tags on proteins can abolish their enzymatic activities or other associated functions, we examined whether the N-terminally tagged Mph1 maintained its in vivo ability to suppress the dna2K1080E mutation. As shown in Fig. 2C (third and fourth rows), expression of both wild type and K113E mutant-tagged proteins still suppressed the growth defect of the dna2K1080E mutant. Since overexpression of FEN1 also rescued the temperature-sensitive growth defect of dna2Δ405N and dna2-1 in addition to dna2K1080E, the stimulation of Fen1 activity appears to be a general mechanism for the suppression of any defective dna2 (39Kim J.H.

These findings are consistent with the notion that the most critical function of Dna2 is dependent on its endonuclease activity. Mph1 Stimulates the Endonuclease Activity of Dna2—Since overexpression of the dna2K1080E mutant allele itself alone resulted in the growth of this mutant, 3C. H. Lee and Y. S.

Here we test the hypothesis that adaptation is a result of different mechanisms at several synaptic connections within the network. In a companion paper (Part I), we showed that adaptation in the photoreceptors (R1–R6) and large monopolar cells (LMC) of the Drosophila eye improves sensitivity to under-represented signals in seconds by enhancing both the amplitude and frequency distribution of LMCs' voltage responses to repeated naturalistic contrast series. In this paper, we show that such adaptation needs both the light-mediated conductance and feedback-mediated synaptic conductance. A faulty feedforward pathway in histamine receptor mutant flies speeds up the LMC output, mimicking extreme light adaptation. A faulty feedback pathway from L2 LMCs to photoreceptors slows down the LMC output, mimicking dark adaptation. These results underline the importance of network adaptation for efficient coding, and as a mechanism for selectively regulating the size and speed of signals in neurons. We suggest that concert action of many different mechanisms and neural connections are responsible for adaptation to visual stimuli. Further, our results demonstrate the need for detailed circuit reconstructions like that of the Drosophila lamina, to understand how networks process information."
https://openalex.org/W1999252644,"It has been repeatedly shown that chronic stress changes dendrites, spines and modulates expression of synaptic molecules. These effects all may impair information transfer between neurons. The present study shows that chronic stress also regulates expression of M6a, a glycoprotein which is localised in axonal membranes. We have previously demonstrated that M6a is a component of glutamatergic axons. The present data reveal that it is the splice variant M6a-Ib, not M6a-Ia, which is strongly expressed in the brain. Chronic stress in male rats (3 weeks daily restraint) has regional effects: quantitative in situ hybridization demonstrated that M6a-Ib mRNA in dentate gyrus granule neurons and in CA3 pyramidal neurons is downregulated, whereas M6a-Ib mRNA in the medial prefrontal cortex is upregulated by chronic stress. This is the first study showing that expression of an axonal membrane molecule is differentially affected by stress in a region-dependent manner. Therefore, one may speculate that diminished expression of the glycoprotein in the hippocampus leads to altered output in the corresponding cortical projection areas. Enhanced M6a-Ib expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (in areas prelimbic and infralimbic cortex) might be interpreted as a compensatory mechanism in response to changes in axonal projections from the hippocampus. Our findings provide evidence that in addition to alterations in dendrites and spines chronic stress also changes the integrity of axons and may thus impair information transfer even between distant brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W2062389185,"The concept of a stress-induced depression has recently been proposed in light of new findings from animal and human
studies. Depression associated with stress involves a number of body systems such as the neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter system and the immune system including
cytokines and the dysregulation of the HPA axis interacting in complex pathways. However, numerous research challenges
present when addressing a tentative concept of stress-induced depression. One of them is the requirement to establish a causative relationship between stressful
environmental factors and stress-related neurochemical and genetic pathways in a complex model of interaction using valid and etiological relevant animal models. Another challenge is the establishment of animal models compatible with the concept of stress-induced depression; however,
chronic mild and social stress models are promising models for the study of stressfully perceived environmental events assembling stressors relevant in depression. Moreover, the consideration of individual psychological neurotic factors presents another major challenge in animal and human
models of stress-induced depression. In addition, the study of translational implications is needed to enhance research into the validity and relevance of a tentative concept of stress-induced depression."
https://openalex.org/W2017516902,"The C-terminal region of Brh2 (Brh2CT), the BRCA2 homolog in Ustilago maydis, is highly conserved and aligns with the DSS1/DNA-binding domain (DBD) of mammalian BRCA2, while the N-terminal region (Brh2NT) is poorly conserved and has no obvious functional domain except for the single Rad51-interacting BRC element.

The repair of damaged DNA by homologous recombination is a high fidelity and universal process for maintaining genome integrity. At the heart of it is the use of an undamaged homologous DNA sequence as a template to direct repair of damaged regions. In eukaryotes, Rad51 plays the key role of promoting the search for the homologous sequence (1San Filippo J. Sung P. Klein H. Annu. Rev.

Biochemical studies with Brh2, the BRCA2 homolog from the fungus Ustilago maydis, have demonstrated that it mediates Rad51 assembly on a protruding single-strand DNA tail (9Yang H. Li Q. Fan J. Holloman W.K. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2005; 433: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Interaction of Rad51 with Brh2 is through the single BRC element located in the N-terminal region of the protein (10Kojic M. Zhou Q. Lisby M. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 678-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The BRC element comprises a sequence of about 30 amino acids (aa) that mimics a critical determinant of the Rad51 polymerization interface (11Pellegrini L. Yu D.S. Lo T. Anand S. Lee M. Blundell T.L. Venkitaraman A.R. Nature. 2002; 420: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 12Lo T. Pellegrini L. Venkitaraman A.R. Blundell T.L. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 1015-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Rad51 also interacts with Brh2 through a second, poorly defined locus, the CRE, located at the extreme C terminus of Brh2 (13Zhou Q. Kojic M. Cao Z. Lisby M. Mazloum N.A. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2512-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These N-terminal and C-terminal elements communicate with each other in some as yet unknown way to support proper Rad51 filament assembly. Such communication requires an interplay that is coordinated by Dss1 (13Zhou Q. Kojic M. Cao Z. Lisby M. Mazloum N.A. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2512-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a small versatile acidic protein that interacts with Brh2 in a region corresponding to a segment of the DSS1/DNA-binding domain (DBD) in mammalian BRCA2 (14Kojic M. Yang H. Kostrub C.F. Pavletich N.P. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1043-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The mammalian BRCA2 DBD domain consists of a tandem array of three oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) folds and a helix-rich domain that is laced to the adjacent OB fold by intertwining with DSS1 (15Yang H. Jeffrey P.D. Miller J. Kinnucan E. Sun Y. Thoma N.H. Zheng N. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. Pavletich N.P. Science. 2002; 297: 1837-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment with BRCA2 indicates that a region corresponding to part of the helix-rich domain and the adjacent OB1 and OB2 folds is conserved in Brh2, but that OB3 is absent. 36 of 40 residues in BRCA2 DBD that contact DSS1 are identical or conservatively substituted in Brh2 (14Kojic M. Yang H. Kostrub C.F. Pavletich N.P. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1043-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mutants lacking Brh2 are extremely sensitive to DNA damage by UV, ionizing radiation, and other genotoxic agents, are deficient in recombination, and are defective in meiosis (16Kojic M. Kostrub C.F. Buchman A.R. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Deletion of the gene encoding Dss1 results in a virtual phenocopy of the brh2 mutant (14Kojic M. Yang H. Kostrub C.F. Pavletich N.P. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1043-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In view of the physical interaction between Brh2 and Dss1, the implication is that Dss1 serves as a positive activator for Brh2. Other studies also provide support for the notion that Dss1 serves as a regulator. Removal of a tract of 40 amino acids from the C terminus of Brh2 is enough to cause complete loss of function, as measured by lack of activity in complementing the UV sensitivity of the brh2 mutant. Yet paradoxically, by removing much longer tracts from the C terminus (with truncation points between residues 503 and 589) that delete the region corresponding to the Dss1/DNA-binding domain (the DBD), resistance to DNA damage is restored substantially when these severely truncated proteins are expressed not only in the brh2 mutant, but also in the dss1 mutant (17Kojic M. Zhou Q. Lisby M. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2547-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This is surprising because the only obvious functional motif recognizable in the remnant N-terminal region of the protein is the BRC element and which is considered to serve in an essentially negative manner by blocking formation or destabilizing the Rad51 filament (4Esashi F. Galkin V.E. Yu X. Egelman E.H. West S.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 468-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 18Davies A.A. Masson J.Y. McIlwraith M.J. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A.

Biol. 2007; 14: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). These findings imply that the longer deletions remove a negative regulatory element from Brh2. The large subunit of replication protein A (RPA70) has a modular arrangement of four domains including an N-terminal protein-protein interaction domain and three ssDNA-binding OB folds (20Bochkarev A. Bochkareva E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), but no residues in common with those in the BRCA2 DBD known from the crystal structure to contact Dss1. Replacing the DBD of Brh2 with the DNA-binding domain comprised of RPA70 OB folds A, B, and C creates a hybrid that is even more competent in restoring resistance to DNA damage and extremely elevated in recombination regardless of Dss1 status (17Kojic M. Zhou Q. Lisby M. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2547-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the N-terminal BRC-containing domain has an inherent ability to organize Rad51 and to support DNA repair independently of Dss1, but that the addition of a domain with strong single-strand DNA binding activity enhances the Rad51-organizing activity. Analogous findings were made in a mammalian system in which a synthetic protein consisting of BRCA2 BRC elements fused to RPA70 was found to suppress the DNA repair and recombination defects of BRCA2-deficient cells (6Saeki H. Siaud N. Christ N. Wiegant W.W. van Buul P.P. Han M. Zdzienicka M.Z. Stark J.M. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8768-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Based on these observations it can be imagined that a Rad51-interaction element coupled with a single-strand-specific DNA binding activity constitutes a primitive mechanism to enable mediator function. Biochemical testing with the mammalian BRCA2 DBD (15Yang H. Jeffrey P.D. Miller J. Kinnucan E. Sun Y. Thoma N.H. Zheng N. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. Pavletich N.P. Science. 2002; 297: 1837-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) and studies using a synthetic construct that consisted of the human BRCA2 DBD fused with a polypeptide spanning BRC3 and BRC4 confirmed the DNA binding ability and preference for single-stranded DNA of the BRCA2 DBD (7San Filippo J. Chi P. Sehorn M.G. Etchin J. Krejci L. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11649-11657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), as was predicted based on its co-crystal structure with oligothymidylate (oligo(dT9)). In experiments with a synthetic version of BRCA2 consisting of the region spanning BRC3 and BRC4 fused to the DBD, stimulation of Rad51 nucleation onto RPA-coated single-stranded DNA was shown to depend on both the Rad51 interaction ability of the BRC domain and DNA binding activity of the DBD (7San Filippo J. Chi P. Sehorn M.G. Etchin J. Krejci L. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11649-11657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A simple mediator model would suggest that Brh2 binds Rad51 by interaction with the BRC element and ferries it to single-stranded DNA through the DNA binding function in the DBD. Yet our observations that the N-terminal region of Brh2 can restore resistance to DNA damage and recombination proficiency in the absence of the canonical Dss1/OB fold-containing DNA-binding domain and without dependence on Dss1 (17Kojic M. Zhou Q. Lisby M. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2547-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) suggest that this part of the protein has some inherent ability to enhance Rad51 filament formation. A simple explanation is that the N-terminal region of Brh2 contains an unrecognized DNA-binding domain that, in concert with the BRC, mediates delivery of Rad51 to damaged sites even in the absence of the apparently canonical Dss1/DNA-binding domain. In the present investigation we tested the idea that the N-terminal region of Brh2 has an inherent DNA binding ability. U. maydis Genetic Methods-Manipulations of U. maydis strains, culture methods, gene transfer procedures, and survival after UV and γ radiation have been described previously (13Zhou Q. Kojic M. Cao Z. Lisby M. Mazloum N.A. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2512-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Kojic M. Mao N. Zhou Q. Lisby M. Holloman W.K. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 67: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). U. maydis strains included UCM350 (wild type for recombination function), UCM565 (brh2), and UCM54 (rec2). Brh2 derivatives used in complementation studies and protein expression were prepared by PCR amplification of regions as specified in figures using the cloned Brh2 gene as template. Similarly, a region from RPA70 spanning OB folds A and B (codons 144–436) was amplified from the cloned gene and fused in-frame with a fragment encoding Brh2 residues 1–373. Brh2 and derivatives were expressed under control of the moderate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter on self-replicating plasmids. Protein Purification-Brh2 and Brh2CT proteins tagged with maltose-binding protein (MBP) in complex with His-tagged Dss1 were purified after overexpression in Escherichia coli as described previously (13Zhou Q. Kojic M. Cao Z. Lisby M. Mazloum N.A. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2512-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Mazloum N. Zhou Q. Holloman W.K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7163-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Brh2NT terminating at residue Met-551 and other truncated forms of the Brh2NT deleted of N- and C-terminal residues were purified as fusion proteins with an N-terminal MBP tag and C-terminal His tag. Purification followed the same protocol developed for the full-length protein involving sequential affinity chromatography on Ni2+-NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose), amylose resin, and monoQ beads, but included an additional step of salt gradient elution from HiTrap heparin-agarose (GE Healthcare). Brh2NT protein devoid of affinity tag was prepared from a fusion protein with an N-terminal MBP tag and C-terminal His tag, which was engineered to contain a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site in the linker regions connecting the MBP and His tags to Brh2NT. After cleavage with TEV protease, Brh2CT was purified by salt gradient elution from monoQ resin using an AKTA FPLC chromatography system (GE Healthcare). Protein was stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol. His-tagged Dss1 was purified after expression in E. coli. The procedure included affinity purification on Ni2+-NTA, gradient elution from monoQ beads, and molecular sieve chromatography on Superose 6 gel filtration column. TEV protease engineered to be highly stabilized was purified from an overproducing E. coli strain (23Kapust R.B. Tozser J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) transformed with pRK793 graciously provided by David S. Waugh (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD). Mouse BRCA2 DBD was generously provided by Jie Fan (Nikola Pavletich Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). DNA Dynamics-DNA binding and D-loop formation were assayed using labeled oligonucleotides by the methods described previously (22Mazloum N. Zhou Q. Holloman W.K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7163-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Mazloum N. Zhou Q. Holloman W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For DNA binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, reactions were performed with 3.3 nm DNA in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 55 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, at 37 °C for 15 min. Glutaraldehyde was added to 0.2% and after an additional 10 min, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was added. Products were examined after electrophoresis at room temperature in 1% agarose gels cast in 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA. Oligonucleotide substrates design was the same as in the previous studies. For analysis of conformational and structural specificity in Brh2, binding oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′-end with 32P, and images of gels were determined by phosphorimaging. The fraction of DNA in complexes was determined using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics). For standard binding comparisons an ss60mer oligonucleotide (derived from phage φX174 sequence 103–162) labeled at the 5′-end with the fluorescent dye IRD800 (MWG Biotech AG) was used as substrate. For D-loop reactions an ss80mer oligonucleotide (derived from pBluescript II sequence 1–80) was used as substrate. Gel images were collected with an Odyssey infrared detection platform (LI-COR Biosciences). All DNA concentrations are expressed in molecules, rather than nucleotide. Biological Activity of Brh2 Lacking the DBD-To define in more detail the biological capabilities of Brh2 N-terminal domain we compared a representative truncation mutant with the DBD removed (Brh21–551 or Brh2NT hereafter) with a Brh2 truncation expressing only the DBD (Brh2505–1075 or Brh2CT hereafter) for ability to complement radiation sensitivity when expressed in a brh2-null mutant. Schematic representations are shown with approximate locations of the Rad51-interacting elements BRC and CRE, a putative nuclear localization signal, the helix-rich domain HD and the two OB folds corresponding to the canonical DBD of BRCA2, and Dss1 with its region of interaction in Brh2 (Fig. 1A). At doses of UV and γ radiation that resulted in about the same degree of killing of the brh2D mutant, Brh2NT exhibited a level of complementation approaching that of the full-length Brh2, while Brh2CT showed little activity (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that the Brh2NT is active in repair of DNA lesions introduced as a consequence of both UV and ionizing radiation. To test the actions of Brh2NT further, we examined its ability to suppress the radiation sensitivity of rec2. Rec2 is the single Rad51 paralog in U. maydis, and mutants depleted of it are also sensitive to UV and ionizing radiation. Unlike dss1, radiation resistance of the rec2 mutant can be substantially restored by expressing the full-length Brh2 (10Kojic M. Zhou Q. Lisby M. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 678-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) ectopically from a moderately strong, constitutive promoter. Here we found that Brh2NT was also effective in restoring resistance of rec2 to γ radiation (Fig. 1C). Nevertheless, Brh2NT was not comparable in activity in restoring resistance to UV, suggesting that the response to DNA lesions arising as a consequence of UV damage is not the same by full-length Brh2 and Brh2NT in the absence of Rec2 function. In contrast, Brh2CT showed little to no ability to suppress the sensitivity of rec2 to UV or γ radiation. The basis for how Brh2 restores radiation resistance to rec2 is not known, but one suggestion is that by increasing the level of Brh2, Rad51 and auxiliary factors can access DNA lesions in a manner ordinarily dependent on Rec2 function. That the response of Brh2NT to UV versus γ-ray-induced damage differs from full-length Brh2 most likely reflects differences in the nature of the lesions, and how they are processed. Single-stranded gaps arise as a consequence of DNA replication past UV photoproducts (25Lopes M. Foiani M. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 15-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), while double-strand breaks result from ionizing radiation. When promoted by Brh2NT, repair of the former is dependent on Rec2, but apparently not the latter. Collectively, these results confirm and extend the conclusions that the N-terminal region of Brh2 indeed has an inherent biological activity comparable to a large degree with the full-length Brh2 protein and that the canonical DNA-binding domain is to some extent dispensable for function. A simple explanation to account for the biological function is that Brh2NT is still able to bind DNA through an unrecognized DNA-binding domain. DNA Binding Activity within Brh2NT-We overproduced and purified Brh2NT and Brh2CT separately to compare them directly for DNA binding activity. As an aid to purification the proteins were fused to an MBP affinity tag. Full-length Brh2 and Brh2CT were necessarily produced as heterotypic complexes with Dss1 (His-tagged) (13Zhou Q. Kojic M.

Biol. 2007; 27: 2512-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but are referred to below as Brh2 and Brh2CT, respectively, for simplicity unless stated otherwise (Fig. 2A). As previous analysis showed that biological activity of Brh2 was not compromised by the presence of the MBP tag, nor that of Dss1 by the His tag (13Zhou Q. Kojic M. Cao Z. Lisby M. Mazloum N.A. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2512-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Kojic M. Zhou Q. Lisby M. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell.

DNA binding was measured using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with 5′ 32P-labeled or 5′ IRD800 fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides as substrate. Full-length Brh2, as noted previously (22Mazloum N. Zhou Q. Holloman W.K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7163-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), exhibited a marked preference for single-stranded versus duplex DNA and formed complexes that migrated in almost ladder-like fashion with progressively slower mobility as protein concentration increased (Fig. 2B), probably reflecting increasing mass of complexes as more and more protein molecules associated with individual DNA molecules. Brh2CT, comprising the canonical DBD, bound DNA with lower affinity-forming complexes that were not as discrete and that included a fraction that failed to enter the gel. To learn whether the MBP tag interfered with DNA binding in the case of Brh2CT, we removed the tag by specific proteolytic cleavage through an engineered TEV recognition site in the linker region fusing the MBP to Brh2CT, but found that the untagged protein was no different in DNA binding properties (data not shown). The Brh2NT fragment bound DNA with capacity and preference for single-stranded conformation matching the full-length protein (Fig. 2B). The complexes migrated somewhat differently from those formed with full-length Brh2. Absent was the ladder of slower mobility complexes. Instead, with increasing protein concentration, the complexes ran with slightly faster mobility. The basis for this slightly increased mobility is not clear but could mean that the Brh2NT complexes assume a more compact form. Moreover, the mobility of the complexes formed with Brh2NT was about the same as with full-length Brh2 despite the substantial difference in the molecular mass between the two proteins. This suggests that the stoichiometry of protein bound per DNA molecule in the complexes is higher with Brh2NT compared with full-length Brh2 such that the total mass of the complexes formed in each case is about the same. In previous studies on the binding specificity of Brh2, it was found that oligonucleotide model structures with D-loops, i.e. a duplex with an internal displaced ss loop, or branches were preferred substrates and were bound with higher affinity than ssDNA (22Mazloum N. Zhou Q. Holloman W.K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7163-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A set of three of these substrates was used to test the specificity of the Brh2 truncations. These included a D-loop, a bubble, i.e. a duplex with an unpaired internal stretch, and a fork, i.e. a duplex with protruding unpaired 5′ and 3′-ss tails. Binding by Brh2CT was weak, and poorly distinguished complexes were formed; whereas in contrast the specificity and binding capacity of Brh2NT paralleled full-length Brh2 (Fig. 2B). As with ssDNA the Brh2NT complexes migrated slightly faster with increasing levels of protein. These studies suggest that the DNA substrate specificity exhibited by the full-length Brh2 protein is governed primarily by determinants within the N-terminal region of the protein. To test whether the DNA binding activity observed with the Brh2NT was an inherent property of the Brh2NT protein and not due to a contaminant in the preparations, we used tag-specific antibodies to see if the complexes could be supershifted. Antibodies to the MBP affinity tag were added after formation of Brh2NT- or Brh2-ssDNA complexes, and the electrophoretic mobility was then analyzed. DNA-bound complexes formed with both full-length Brh2 and Brh2NT were shifted to a slower mobility (Fig. 2C) indicating that the protein present in the shifted DNA complexes carried the MBP tag. To examine whether the DNA-binding activity was due to the MBP tag, we removed the tag by specific proteolytic cleavage through an engineered TEV recognition site in the linker region fusing the MBP to Brh2NT (Fig. 2A). This protein deleted of the MBP tag bound DNA with similar affinity as the tagged protein strongly supporting the notion that a DNA binding activity was inherent in the Brh2 N-terminal region (Fig. 2D). The complexes formed with the untagged Brh2NT ran with a slightly slower mobility compared with the tagged protein. The reason for this is not clear, but one possibility is that the MBP tag sterically hinders loading of adjacent Brh2NT molecules along the length of the oligonucleotide. Thus, without the MBP tag slightly more Brh2NT might be able to bind to the DNA to form a more slowly migrating complex. No mobility shift of the DNA substrate was observed in reactions containing MBP alone (data not shown). These controls show that a previously unrecognized DNA binding activity is associated with the N-terminal region of Brh2. DNA Binding Activity of Brh2 Compared with BRCA2 DBD-In the seminal structural study describing the tandem arrangement of the helical domain and three OB folds of the mammalian BRCA2 DBD, the DNA binding activity and conformational preference for ssDNA were confirmed by direct biochemical experimentation (15Yang H. Jeffrey P.D. Miller J. Kinnucan E. Sun Y. Thoma N.H. Zheng N. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. Pavletich N.P. Science. 2002; 297: 1837-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Protein-bound complexes with oligo(dT) in the range of 32–36 residues were reported to form avidly with 300 nm BRCA2 DBD. We compared murine BRCA2 DBD side-by-side with Brh2 and derivative proteins (Fig. 3A) using the ss60mer natural sequence DNA substrate. Under our reaction conditions with this longer DNA oligomer half of the DNA substrate was shifted by addition of 180 nm BRCA2 DBD to form complexes that were fairly uniform in mobility (Fig. 3B). By comparison 310 nm Brh2CT was required to shift half the input DNA. Complexes that formed were diffuse or else failed to enter the gel. The stronger binding by BRCA2 DBD could reflect a contribution from the third OB fold, which makes contacts in its binding groove with DNA according to the atomic structure (15Yang H. Jeffrey P.D. Miller J. Kinnucan E. Sun Y. Thoma N.H. Zheng N. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. Pavletich N.P. Science. 2002; 297: 1837-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) and which appears to be missing from Brh2. On the other hand a much lower concentration of Brh2 (20 nm) or Brh2NT (10 nm) was required to shift half the DNA, indicating that these proteins bound DNA tighter than BRCA2 DBD by more than an order of magnitude (Fig. 3C). These observations suggest that the primary site within Brh2 for associating with DNA resides in the N-terminal region and support the hypothesis that the biological activity manifested by the N-terminal region is due to the coupling of the BRC element to a DNA binding activity. Mapping the Brh2NT DNA-binding Domain-In our previous genetic studies showing that biologically active variants of Brh2 independent of Dss1 could be obtained by truncating the entire DBD, we performed a deletion analysis to define the region within the N-terminal fragment responsible for complementing UV sensitivity of the brh2 mutant (17Kojic M. Zhou Q. Lisby M. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2547-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Truncation from the N terminus was without effect upon removal of 213 residues, but when the deletion endpoint was within 10 resi"
https://openalex.org/W2080472139,"A neural glycotope, human natural killer-1 carbohydrate, is involved in synaptic plasticity. The key biosynthetic enzyme is a glucuronyltransferase, GlcAT-P, a type II membrane protein comprising an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, stem region, and C-terminal catalytic domain. Previously, we reported that GlcAT-P has two isoforms differing in only the presence or absence of the N-terminal 13 amino acids (P-N13) in the cytoplasmic tail, but the functional distinction of these two isoforms has not been reported. Herein, we show that when expressed in Neuro2A cells, short form GlcAT-P (sGlcAT-P) exhibited significantly higher glucuronylation activity than the longer form (lGlcAT-P), despite their comparable specific activities in vitro. In addition, sGlcAT-P was strictly localized in Golgi apparatus, whereas lGlcAT-P was mainly localized in Golgi but partly in the endoplasmic reticulum. We demonstrated that the small GTPase, Sar1, recognized a dibasic motif in the cytoplasmic tail near P-N13 that was important for exiting the endoplasmic reticulum, and Sar1 interacted with sGlcAT-P more strongly than lGlcAT-P. Finally, the attachment of P-N13 to another glycosyltransferase, polysialyltransferase-I (ST8Sia-IV), had similar effects, such as reduced activity and entrapment within endoplasmic reticulum. These results suggest that P-N13 can control glycosyltransferase transport through Sar1 binding interference."
https://openalex.org/W2036705673,"Background Previous studies have demonstrated that knockout or inhibition of Platelet/Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (PECAM, CD31) in a number of murine strains results in impaired inflammatory responses, but that no such phenotype is seen in the C57BL/6 (B6) murine background. Methodology/Principal Findings We have undertaken a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping effort between FVB/n (FVB) and B6 mice deficient for PECAM to identify the gene or genes responsible for this unique feature of B6 mice. We have identified a locus on murine chromosome 2 at approximately 35.8 Mb that is strongly associated (LOD score = 9.0) with inflammatory responses in the absence of PECAM. Conclusions/Significance These data potentiate further study of the diapedesis machinery, as well as potential identification of new components of this machinery. As such, this study is an important step to better understanding the processes of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2096481195,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked ephrin-As play important roles in various biological events, such as neuronal development and immune responses. Because the surface amount of ephrin-As is critical in these events, the trafficking of ephrin-As must be regulated by intracellular machinery. In particular, Src family protein-tyrosine kinases regulate the intracellular trafficking of several membrane molecules and act downstream of ephrin-As; whether they affect the trafficking of ephrin-As, however, has remained unexplored. Here, we report that the activity of Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, particularly Fyn, negatively regulates the cell-surface amount of ephrin-As. The expression of constitutively active Fyn decreases the surface amount of ephrin-As. Conversely, the expression of dominant-negative Fyn or the application of a Src-family inhibitor increases the surface amount of ephrin-A2. The total cellular amount of ephrin-A is inversely correlated with its amount on the surface, suggesting that ephrin-As are more stable in the intracellular compartment. The expression of constitutively active Fyn increases the amount of sphingomyelin clusters on the plasma membrane, whereas inhibiting Fyn decreases it. Moreover, the inhibition of sphingomyelin synthesis greatly increases the surface amount of ephrin-As. Altogether, these results suggest that Fyn regulates the surface amount of ephrin-As by modulating the metabolism of sphingomyelin, which presumably inhibits the trafficking of ephrin-As from endosomes to the plasma membrane.

Ephrins are the ligands of Eph receptor tyrosine kinases, and these molecules play central roles in many physiological and pathological events, such as neuronal development, adult brain function, angiogenesis, cancer, and immune responses (1Arvanitis D. Davy A. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 416-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 2Pasquale E.B. Cell. 2008; 133: 38-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Ephrins are structurally classified into two subclasses: ephrin-As are tethered to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 3The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; AP, alkaline phosphatase; ApoER2, apolipoprotein E receptor 2; APP, amyloid precursor protein; CA, constitutively active; DN, dominant-negative; FB1, fumonisin B1; HmV-NT-Lys, His6- and monomeric Venus-tagged non-toxic lysenin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; NPP6, nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 6; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine; PP3, 4-amino-7-phenylpyrazol[3,4-d]pyrimidine; RFP, red fluorescent protein; SFK, Src-family tyrosine kinase; SM, sphingomyelin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. linkage, whereas ephrin-Bs are single transmembrane proteins. Ephrin-As and -Bs bind to EphAs and EphBs, respectively, with some exceptions (1Arvanitis D. Davy A. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 416-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 2Pasquale E.B. Cell. 2008; 133: 38-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). The net concentration of functional ephrins (i.e. those on the plasma membrane) is important, a fact that is best exemplified by the mechanism of retinal axon guidance (3Nakamoto M. Cheng H.J. Friedman G.C. McLaughlin T. Hansen M.J. Yoon C.H. O'Leary D.D. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 755-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 4Flanagan J.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The amount of ephrin-A protein is regulated at the transcriptional level (4Flanagan J.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 5Cheng H.J. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 1994; 79: 157-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), but such regulation by itself is insufficient to achieve the tight regulation of ephrin concentration on the plasma membrane. In fact, the surface expression of many membrane receptor and ligand molecules is regulated at the posttranslational level by intracellular signaling cascades. For example, during the oocyte meiotic maturation of nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the endocytosis of the Eph receptor is controlled both by intracellular adaptor proteins and by G protein signaling (6Cheng H. Govindan J.A. Greenstein D. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 705-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The intracellular trafficking of Notch receptor and its ligand molecules are regulated by several proteins (7Le Borgne R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), ensuring the signaling capacity of the system. On the other hand, the mechanism by which intracellular signaling cascades affect the surface amount of ephrins remains largely unexplored. Ephrin-A proteins, like many other GPI-linked proteins, are localized to the so-called “lipid-raft” microdomain on the plasma membrane (8Gauthier L.R. Robbins S.M. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), although the definition, size, biochemical nature, biophysical properties, and physiological importance of such microdomains are still matters of debate (9Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 10Mishra S. Joshi P.G. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Whether the amount and localization of such microdomains are spatiotemporally regulated in neuronal cells remains unknown. Conceivably, the surface expression and/or distribution of ephrin-A is influenced, or even governed, by the amount and/or localization of the lipid rafts. Moreover, ephrin-A is not merely a ligand but also functions as a “receptor” of the EphA “ligand” in a phenomenon called “reverse signaling” (1Arvanitis D. Davy A. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 416-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 2Pasquale E.B. Cell. 2008; 133: 38-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). In particular, the binding of the ectodomain of EphA to ephrin-A activates Fyn, a member of the Src-family tyrosine kinases (SFKs), in ephrin-A-bearing cells (11Davy A. Gale N.W. Murray E.W. Klinghoffer R.A. Soriano P. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3125-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) via the p75 neurotrophin receptor (12Lim Y.S. McLaughlin T. Sung T.C. Santiago A. Lee K.F. O'Leary D.D. Neuron. 2008; 59: 746-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Recently, Fyn activity was reported to modulate the intracellular trafficking of TrkB, a receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (13Pereira D.B. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Fyn induces the translocation of TrkB into the intracellular lipid-raft fraction (13Pereira D.B. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). SFK is also involved in the intracellular trafficking of epidermal growth factor receptors (14Ware M.F. Tice D.A.

However, whether Fyn activity affects the intracellular trafficking of ephrin-A is still unknown. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of Fyn activity on the intracellular trafficking of ephrin-A protein. We report that Fyn activity negatively regulates the surface amount of ephrin-A. Moreover, this effect of Fyn is mediated by the metabolism of sphingomyelin (SM), a major component of the lipid raft microdomain and a regulator of intracellular trafficking. These results led us to hypothesize a novel model regarding the regulatory mechanism of ephrin-A and its downstream signaling. Expression Vectors-The expression vectors for Myc-tagged ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5 were described previously (19Hattori M. Osterfield M. Flanagan J.G. Science. 2000; 289: 1360-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The expression vectors for the Fyn mutants (20Fusaki N. Semba K. Katagiri T. Suzuki G. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Int.

The expression vector for nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 6 (NPP6) was a generous gift from Prof. Junken Aoki (Tohoku University, Japan). The expression vector for red fluorescent protein (RFP, DsRed-Express) was purchased from Clontech-Takara Bio (Mountain View, CA). Antibodies and Reagents-Anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10) and anti-β-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (AC-15) were purchased from Sigma. Anti-caveolin-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (N-20) and anti-flotillin-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (H-104) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies and HRP-streptavidin were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Alexa-Fluor594-conjugated secondary antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. Fumonisin B1 (FB1), 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2), and 4-amino-7-phenylpyrazol[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP3) were purchased from Merck Biosciences (Darmstadt, Germany). N-Hexanoyl-d-sphingoshine (C6-ceramide) and sphingomyelin were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfection-COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Equitech-Bio, Kerrville, TX) and antibiotics. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantification of the Surface Amount of Ephrin-A Using EphA3-alkaline Phosphatase Fusion Protein-Culture supernatant containing EphA3-alkaline phosphatase (AP) was obtained, and the binding assay was performed as reported previously (23Flanagan J.G. Cheng H.J. Feldheim D.A. Hattori M. Lu Q. Vanderhaeghen P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with EphA3-AP for 60 min, washed five times with Hanks’ balanced salt solution containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, treated for 2 min with an acetone-formalin fixative (60% acetone, 8% formalin, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2), washed two times in HEPES-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2), and then incubated at 65 °C for 30 min to inactivate the endogenous AP activity. After rinsing twice with AP buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5), the cells were stained with 0.17 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 0.33 mg/ml of nitro blue tetrazolium in AP buffer. The reactions were stopped by changing the solution to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 20 mm EDTA. Microscopic images were captured using a color-cooled charge-coupled device camera and a VB-6000 image control system (Keyence, Osaka, Japan) equipped with a SZX7 stereoscopic microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Western Blotting-Samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blotted membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h and incubated with the primary antibody for 2 h. After washing four times with TBST, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:4000) for 1 h and washed, and the labeled proteins were detected using Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Images were captured using a LAS3000mini system (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Biotinylation of Cell-surface Proteins-Biotinylation of the cell-surface proteins was performed as described previously (24Morimura T. Hattori M. Ogawa M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16901-16908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Twenty-four hours after transfection, COS-7 cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 0.125 mg/ml of sulfo-NHS-biotin (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing twice with PBS containing 100 mm glycine to stop the reaction, the cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100). The lysates were recovered and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C to remove debris. The supernatant was then incubated with streptavidin-conjugated agarose (Sigma) and rotated for 60 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 3,300 × g for 1 min, the supernatants were removed and the resins were washed six times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and eluted with SDS-PAGE sampling buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue). Detection of SM Clusters in Situ-HmV-NT-Lys protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus-RP (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. HmV-NT-Lys solutions were diluted in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. To detect the SM clusters in situ, the cells were fixed and incubated with 1–2 μg/ml HmV-NT-Lys for 1.5–3 h and washed with PBS four times. The fluorescent images were captured using a BZ-9000 digital fluorescence microscope (Keyence). Immunocytochemistry-The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min or with 4% formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS twice, the cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 30 min and then blocked by incubation with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with the primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature, washed four times with PBS, incubated with the secondary antibody for 90 min, and washed four times with PBS and twice with water. To visualize the nucleus, 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) was added to the secondary antibody solution. Fluorescent images were captured using a BZ-9000 digital fluorescence microscope. In the case of optical sectioning, the samples were examined using an LSM510meta confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Tokyo, Japan). Sphingolipid Depletion and Repletion-The cells were depleted of SM by growing them in the presence of 40 μg/ml FB1 for 48 h. For repletion, 5 μm C6-ceramide was simultaneously added to the FB1-containing culture media. Lipid Extraction and Analysis Using TLC-Prior to the phospholipid analysis, COS-7 cells were preincubated with medium containing 5 μm PP2 or PP3 for 24 h. After washing with PBS twice, the cells were lysed under a hypotonic condition containing 0.1 m acetic acid. The cellular total lipids were extracted according to the method described by Bligh and Dyer (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the extracts were analyzed using TLC on silica gel 60 TLC plates (Amersham Biosciences) using a running solvent composed of chloroform:methanol:water at a ratio of 25:15:2. Phospholipid spots were visualized by spraying with Dittmer’s reagent (26Dittmer J.C. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 15: 126-127Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Quantification and Analysis of Fluorescent Intensities-For the fluorometric assays, the mean fluorescent intensity was scored using ImageJ analysis software, version 1.41m (rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). Images were captured using a BZ-9000 digital fluorescence microscope (Keyence) with a 20× objective, and individual cells in 10–15 randomly selected microscopic fields were traced. Dividing or dead cells were excluded from the measurements based on the Hoechst staining patterns. To calculate the staining intensity of HmV-NT-Lys, the RFP-expressing area in each cell was outlined using an automated program and was defined as the whole cell region. The mean fluorescence intensity of the HmV-NT-Lys image in the corresponding region was calculated by subtracting the background and was expressed as 256 gradations. To calculate the mean fluorescence intensity of surface Myc-ephrin-A2, the optically observed area of each cell was defined as the whole cell region, and the mean fluorescence intensity of the Myc-immunoreactive images was calculated. All measurements from two independent experiments were performed in a blinded manner. Statistical Analysis-Multiple group comparisons among each group were made using the Scheffé F-test after one-way analysis of variance. The values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Modulation of Fyn Activity Affects the Surface Amount of Ephrin-A-COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the expression vector for Myc-ephrin-A2 together with that for dominant negative Fyn (Fyn-DN), that for constitutively active Fyn (Fyn-CA), or pcDNA3.1 (control). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were stained with EphA3-AP to assess the surface amount of Myc-ephrin-A2. When Fyn-DN was co-transfected, the surface amount of Myc-ephrin-A2 increased, compared with that of the control (Fig. 1, B and A, respectively). On the other hand, the co-expression of Fyn-CA dramatically reduced the surface amount of Myc-ephrin-A2 (Fig. 1C). Staining with the control AP gave no signal in the Myc-ephrin-A2-transfected cells (Fig. 1K). These results indicate that Fyn activity negatively regulates the surface amount of Myc-ephrin-A2. To verify the role of Fyn on the surface expression of other types of GPI-linked ephrin-A, Myc-ephrin-A5 was expressed in COS-7 cells either with pcDNA3.1, Fyn-DN, or Fyn-CA. EphA3-AP staining clearly revealed that the surface amount of Myc-ephrin-A5 increased when the cells were cotransfected with Fyn-DN (Fig. 1E) and decreased when the cells were co-transfected with Fyn-CA (Fig. 1F). The cells expressing Myc-ephrin-A5 were not stained by control AP (Fig. 1L). These results indicate that a common mechanism exists for regulating the surface amount of Myc-ephrin-A2 and Myc-ephrin-A5. We next checked whether the inhibition of endogenous SFK activity was sufficient for increasing the surface amount of Myc-ephrin-As. COS-7 cells expressing either Myc-ephrin-A2 or Myc-ephrin-A5 were incubated with 5 μm PP2, an SFK inhibitor, for 24 h and then stained with EphA3-AP. As a control, the cells were incubated with PP3, an inactive analogue of PP2. The surface amount of Myc-ephrin-A2 in the PP2-treated cells was more abundant than that in the PP3-treated cells (Fig. 1, H and G, respectively). The same tendency was observed in cells expressing Myc-ephrin-A5 (Fig. 1, J and I). Thus, these results indicate that the surface amounts of Myc-ephrin-As are regulated by the endogenous SFK activity. Fyn Activity Modulates the Surface Amount of Ephrin-A by Altering Its Intracellular Sorting-By which mechanism does SFK regulate the surface amount of ephrin-A? We first speculated that SFK simply regulates the total amount of ephrin-A protein in the cell. To test this hypothesis, COS-7 cells were transfected with the expression vector for Myc-ephrin-A2 together with pcDNA3.1 (control), Fyn-DN, or Fyn-CA, and whole cell lysates were prepared 24 h later. These lysates were then analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 2A, top panel, lanes 1–3). Quite surprisingly, the co-expression of Fyn-DN greatly decreased the total amount of Myc-ephrin-A2 (Fig. 2A, top panel, lane 2), whereas the expression of Fyn-CA increased it (Fig. 2A, top panel, lane 3). In other words, the total amount of Myc-ephrin-A2 in the cells expressing Fyn mutants was inversely correlated with the surface amount of Myc-ephrin-A2 (Fig. 1, A–C). The amounts of caveolin-1 and flotillin-1, two proteins that are localized to the “lipid raft,” did not change (Fig. 2A, middle panels, lanes 1–3). The amounts of β-actin were also unaffected (Fig. 2A, bottom panel, lanes 1–3). Likewise, the expression of Fyn-DN and Fyn-CA decreased and slightly increased the total amount of Myc-ephrin-A5, respectively (Fig. 2A, top panel, lanes 5 and 6, respectively), without affecting the amounts of caveolin-1, flotillin-1, or β-actin (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6). We next asked whether the surface amounts of other proteins were affected by modulating Fyn activity. For this purpose, the cells were transfected with expression vectors for Myc-ephrin-A2 and either pcDNA3.1, Fyn-DN, or Fyn-CA, and the cell-surface proteins were labeled with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. The biotinylated proteins were precipitated using streptavidin-conjugated agarose, followed by Western blotting analysis. When transfected with Fyn-DN, Myc-ephrin-A2 protein in the biotinylated (cell surface) fraction increased (Fig. 2B, lane 2), whereas that in the corresponding fraction of Fyn-CA co-transfected cells decreased (Fig. 2B, lane 3), confirming the results of EphA3-AP staining (Fig. 1, A–C). On the other hand, the expression of the Fyn mutants hardly affected the surface amounts of most of the other cellular proteins (Fig. 2B, lanes 4–6), as assessed by detection with HRP-streptavidin. These results suggest that the surface amount of ephrin-As is selectively regulated by SFK activity, which is achieved by modulating the intracellular sorting of ephrin-A protein. It is also suggested that ephrin-As in the intracellular compartment are more stable than those on the plasma membrane, because the total amounts of Myc-ephrin-As were more abundant in cells that have them mostly in the intracellular compartment (i.e. Fyn-CA-expressing cells, Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 6) than in cells with Myc-ephrin-As on the plasma membrane (i.e. Fyn-DN-expressing cells, Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 5). The cellular distribution of ephrin-A2 was also examined by immunostaining. Cells expressing Myc-ephrin-A2 alone (Fig. 3A), with Fyn-DN (Fig. 3B), or with Fyn-CA (Fig. 3C) were fixed and stained with anti-Myc antibody without permeabilization to detect the surface Myc-ephrin-A2. Under these conditions, the total fluorescence signal was higher in the Fyn-DN-transfected cells (Fig. 3B) and lower in the Fyn-CA-transfected cells (Fig. 3C) than that in the control cells (Fig. 3A). Then, we next compared the intracellular localization of Myc-ephrin-A2 by immunostaining after membrane permeabilization. As shown in Fig. 3D, Myc-ephrin-A2 protein was distributed mostly along the edge of the cell, the putative cell-surface region, and was also diffusely present in the cytoplasmic region. In cells co-expressing Fyn-DN, the fluorescence signals at the edge of the cell were augmented, whereas those in the intracellular region were diminished (Fig. 3E). In cells co-expressing Fyn-CA, on the other hand, the cell-surface signals were diminished and signals were often found throughout the cytoplasm, distributed in apparently clustered and punctate manner (Fig. 3F, arrowheads), indicating that Myc-ephrin-A2 protein tends to be retained within the cell when Fyn activity is high. These results thus strongly suggest that Fyn activity affects the surface expression of Myc-ephrin-A2 by selectively changing the intracellular trafficking of this protein. Fyn Regulates the Cellular SM Level and Clustering-We next investigated whether SFK activity can modulate the amount or localization of the lipid-raft microdomain on the plasma membrane, where ephrin-As are thought to localize. For this purpose, COS-7 cells were transfected with either pcDNA3.1, Fyn-DN, or Fyn-CA followed by staining with HmV-NT-Lys, which binds specifically to SM clusters (22Kiyokawa E. Baba T. Otsuka N. Makino A. Ohno S. Kobayashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24072-24084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Ishitsuka R. Yamaji-Hasegawa A. Makino A. Hirabayashi Y. Kobayashi T. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 296-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The shape of each transfected cell was simultaneously visualized using the fluorescence of co-expressed RFP. The SM clusters in the control COS-7 cells were localized rather diffusively (Fig. 4, A and D). In cells expressing Fyn-DN, the amount of SM clusters decreased, compared with that in the control cells (Fig. 4, B and E). In contrast, cells expressing Fyn-CA had large and/or abundant SM clusters (Fig. 4, C and F). As shown in Fig. 4G, the fluorescence intensity of the HmV-NT-Lys signals significantly decreased in Fyn-DN-transfected cells and increased in Fyn-CA-transfected cells: the averages of the mean intensities were 60.2 ± 23.3 (pcDNA3.1), 38.6 ± 18.9 (Fyn-DN), and 98.8 ± 50.7 (Fyn-CA), respectively. Thus, Fyn activity positively regulates the amount of SM clusters on the plasma membrane. To test whether endogenous SFK activity modulates the cellular SM levels and clusters, we applied PP2 or PP3 to COS-7 cells and stained them with HmV-NT-Lys. Consequently, the amount of SM clusters markedly decreased when the cells were treated with PP2 but not with PP3 (Fig. 4, I and H, respectively). Concomitantly, the total cellular SM amount was much lower in the PP2-treated cells (Fig. 4J, lane 4) than in the PP3-treated cells (Fig. 4J, lane 3). Thus, SFK activity modulates the cellular SM level and clustering. We next compared the localization of Myc-ephrin-A2 and SM in the Fyn-CA-expressing cells by combining immunocytochemistry and HmV-NT-Lys staining after membrane permeabilization. As shown in Fig. 5A, many clusters or vesicles of Myc-ephrin-A2 were observed when Fyn-CA was co-expressed. Interestingly, few of these clusters or vesicles overlapped with the SM clusters (Fig. 5, C and D) within the cells. Thus, although Myc-ephrin-A2 and SM may be located in the same microdomain on the plasma membrane, they are segregated to within the intracellular compartment of Fyn-CA-expressing cells. Cell-surface Amount of Ephrin-A Is Regulated by SM-We next explored the possibility that a change in the amount of SM might affect the surface amount of ephrin-A2. To alter the cellular sphingolipid levels, the cells were treated with FB1, which inhibits sphingosine N-acyltransferase (28Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FB1 reduces sphingolipid biosynthesis without affecting cellular cholesterol levels, and the addition of C6-ceramide to FB1-treated cells restores the cellular sphingolipid levels (29Chatterjee S. Smith E.R. Hanada K. Stevens V.L. Mayor S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1583-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells expressing Myc-ephrin-A2 were incubated with FB1 in the presence or absence of C6-ceramide and were stained with HmV-NT-Lys (Fig. 6, A–C) or with EphA3-AP (Fig. 6, D–F). Under the control conditions, the COS-7 cells were brightly stained by HmV-NT-Lys (Fig. 6A). When treated with FB1, the amo"

The aim of the present investigation was to search for correlations between the magnitude of coronary artery disease, as assessed by angiography, and a number of systemic parameters. A group of 116 patients (80 male, 36 female) with coronary heart disease diagnosed by angiography, aged 62.0+/-10.5 years, was the subject of an observational study. Correlation and linear regression analysis using coronary artery disease burden (CADB - sum of the percentage of the luminal stenosis encountered in all the lesions of the coronary arterial trees) as dependent variable, and age, sex, plasma calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, estimated glomerular filtration rate and body mass index as independent variables, were carried out. Significant correlation values versus CADB were seen with age (r 0.19, p 0.04), uric acid (r 0.18, p 0.048) and fasting plasma glucose (r 0.33, p<0.001). Linear regression analysis, yielding a global significance level of 0.002, showed a significant value for glucose (p 0.018) and for sex (0.008). In conclusion, among several systemic parameters studied, plasma glucose was found to be correlated to coronary artery atherosclerosis lesions."
