https://openalex.org/W1815087127,"Growing surface cultures of 3T3 cells possess a low level of glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, an important enzyme in triglyceride synthesis. When 3T3-C2, a subline that does not undergo appreciable adipose conversion, reaches confluence, the level of the enzyme does not increase. In 3T3-F442A, a subline that undergoes the conversion with high frequency, the specific activity of the enzyme increases about 600-fold. The enzyme of the adipose 3T3 cells is different from that of non-adipose 3T3 cells in its thermal stability and its affinity for dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The enzyme of the adipose cells probably corresponds to the stable adult form of the enzyme, as described previously, and the enzyme of non-adipose 3T3 cells is probably the unstable embryonic form. For this reason, the change in the enzyme that takes place during the adipose conversion is greater than would be indicated simply by the total increase in specific activity. If, as seems likely, the two forms of glycerophosphate dehydrogenase are the products of independent genes, the adipose conversion may activate a hitherto silent gene for the stable enzyme."

The absence of any one ingredient impairs performance dramatically, but the presence of all three permits ready identification of scores of substances, with performance seemingly limited only by the inherent confusability of the stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1516138002,"Incubation of human serum with D-[6-3H]glucose resulted in the gradual accumulation of radioactivity in acid-precipitable material. Upon chromatography on Sephadex G-200, radioactivity was found associated with each of the major molecular weight classes of serum protein. Purified human serum albumin was also glucosylated in vitro upon exposure to D-[6-3H]glucose in phosphate-buffered saline. The glucosylated and unmodified albumins were separated by ion exchange chromatography. The physiological significance of these observations in vitro was confirmed by the isolation and quantitation of glucosylated albumin from normal human serum. Glucosylated albumin represents approximately 6 to 15% of total serum albumin in normal adults. The post-translational modification appears to occur by a nonenzymatic process analogous to that responsible for glucosylation of hemoglobin A to hemoglobin AIc, i.e. through Schiff base formation and Amadori rearrangement to a ketoamine derivative."
https://openalex.org/W2080329809,"By means of two-stage, nonlinear multivariate pattern recognition, electroencephalograms (EEG's) were analyzed during performance of verbal and spatial tasks. Complex scalp distributions of θ-, β-, and, to a lesser extent, α-band spectral intensities discriminated between the two members of a pair of tasks, such as writing sentences and Koh's block design. Small EEG asymmetries were probably attributable to limb movements and other uncontrolled noncognitive aspects of tasks. Significant EEG differences between cognitive tasks were eliminated when controls for inter-task differences in efferent activity, stimulus characteristics, and performance-related factors were introduced. Each controlled task was associated with an approximately 10 percent reduction, as compared with visual fixation, in the magnitude of α- and β-band spectral intensity. This effect occurred bilaterally and was approximately the same over occipital, parietal, and central regions, with some minor difference over the frontal region in the β band. With these controls, no evidence for lateralization of different cognitive functions was found in the EEG."

https://openalex.org/W1561534093,"A procedure for the isolation of bovine Factor V has been developed. The Factor V is isolated from bovine plasma by a series of steps including barium citrate adsorption, polyethylene glycol precipitation, QAE-cellulose adsorption, hydrophobic chromatography on octyl Sepharose, ammonium sulfate fractionation, preparative electrophoresis on acrylamide gels, and finally, phenyl Sepharose chromatography. During isolation, judicious use of inhibitors including benzamidine hydrochloride, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and diisopropylphosphorofluoridate has been applied to prevent activation of the Factor V TO Factor Va. The activity of the isolated protein increases by a factor of 80 when stimulated by catalytic amounts of thrombin. The specific activity of the material after thrombin activation is 1250 units/mg of protein when evaluated versus a bovine Factor V standard in human factor V-deficient plasma. The isolated protein is a single component when analyzed by a variety of electrophoretic techniques and has been characterized in terms of its gross physical and chemical properties. Bovine Factor V is a single chain glycoprotein which has a molecular weight of 330,000. The single chain nature of the molecule has been established by sedimentation equilibrium studies of the native molecule and on the molecule in 6 M guanidinium chloride with and without disulfide bond reduction. In addition to these mass measurements, the single chain nature of the molecule has been established by hydrodynamic estimation of the random coil volume by sedimentation velocity studies of the reduced carboxyamidomethylated protein in 6 M guanidinium chloride. Native Factor V has a sedimentation coefficient so20,w of 9.19 S, which indicates the molecule is highly asymmetric. The frictional ratio f/fmin for the molecule is estimated to be 2.01, and the axial ratio of the equivalent prolate ellipsoid is 25:1. Thus, present data suggest that Factor V is a rod-like molecule composed of a single chain."
https://openalex.org/W2097714666,"The complete amino acid sequence has been derived for human C-reactive protein (CRP). The protein yielded a unique sequence containing 187 amino acids in a single polypeptide chain. The NH2-terminal residue of CRP is pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid and the COOH terminus is proline. The 2 half-cystine residues at positions 36 and 78 are involved in a disulfide bond. Based on the amino acid composition derived from the sequence data, a minimal molecular weight of 20,946 has been calculated for human CRP. This value agrees well with the molecular weight of 21,500 established by gel filtration of CRP in 5.0 M guanidine Cl (Gotschlich, E.C., and Edelman, G.M. (1965) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 54, 558–566). The primary structure of human CRP has been examined for internal homology and compared to all known proteins whose structures were published before April, 1978 by two computer programs; program SEARCH and program RELATE (Dayhoff, M. O., ed (1976) in Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, Vol. 5, Suppl. 2, pp. 3–8, National Biomedical Research Foundation, Silver Spring, MD). The computer analyses showed no significant repeating sequences within the C-reactive protein molecule. This observation seems to rule out the possibility of gene duplication in the evolution of this protein. Distant homologies, which were statistically insignificant, have been noted to the CH2 domain of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and to C3a anaphylotoxin. The homologie noted are insufficient to support a common evolutionary origin of these proteins. No homology region in other heavy chains was observed. It is therefore preferable, at this point in time, to assign CRP and the protein known as 9.5 S alpha-glycoprotein, P component, and Clt to a new super family unrelated to any other proteins investigated. The homology between these proteins was demonstrated previously (Osmand, A.P., Friedenson, B., Gewurz, H., Painter, R.H., Hofmann, T., and Shelton, E. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74, 739–743) on the basis of sequence data on approximately 20 NH2-terminal residues of rabbit C-reactive protein, of Clt, and a cyanogen bromide fragment of human CRP."
https://openalex.org/W1484760080,"Mononucleosomes greatly enriched in non-histone proteins were prepared by limited digestion of testis nuclei with micrococcal nuclease. Five to fifteen per cent of the chromatin was solubilized and could be separated by adjustment to 0.1 M NaCl, into a soluble fraction MN1, consisting of mononucleosomes containing the four inner histones and the small basic non-histone, H6, associated with a 140-base-pair DNA fragment. H1 was notably absent in MN1. The fraction insoluble in 0.1 M NaCl (MN2) comprised a mixture of mono-, di-, tri-, and oligosomes. MN2 monosome fraction contained the four inner histones plus H1 and lacked H6 and the length of its DNA was 170 base-pairs. Previous work had shown that limited micrococcal nuclease digestion of trout testis nuclei released a great proportion of the non-histone protein, high mobility group protein T (HMG-T). It seems likely that HMG-T is the major non-histone protein located in the linker regions of a subset of nucleosomes containing the non-histone protein H6 as a major structural component. Moreover, the presence of HMG-T renders this subset of nucleosomes very sensitive to micrococcal nuclease. Hybridization experiments were performed to demonstrate that the DNA from MN1 monosomes corresponds to a subset of the trout testis genome. This DNA subset is greatly enriched in sequences that are present in cytoplasmic RNA. Chromatin subunits enriched in their content of H6 and HMG-T could also be obtained by limited digestion of trout testis chromatin with DNase II followed by precipitation with MgCl2."

https://openalex.org/W1530857641,"It has been proposed (Creutz, C. E., Pazoles, C. J., and Pollard, H. B. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 2858-2866) that synexin, an adrenal medullary protein that causes Ca2+-dependent aggregation of isolated chromaffin granules, might be the intracellular receptor for Ca2+ in the process of exocytosis. We now report that Ca2+ interacts directly with isolated synexin, inducing rapid self-association. Mg2+ or Sr2+ cannot substitute for Ca2+, and Ba2+ is only weakly effective at stimulating self-association. We have analyzed 90 degree light scattering data to determine a titration curve for the activation of synexin by Ca2+ in the self-association reaction. The curve has a Hill coefficient of 2.3 and is half-maximal at 200 micron Ca2+, which correlates exactly with the Ca2+ titration curve for the aggregation of chromaffin granules by synexin. Electron microscopy of negatively stained samples reveals that synexin monomers associate to form 50 A by 150 A rods which in turn associate side to side and end to end to form bundles of parallel rods. We suggest that synexin exists as a soluble monomer in the cytoplasm of the resting chromaffin cell and that when the cell is stimulated to secrete, the increase in the intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ causes synexin to form rods, similar to those formed in vitro, which bind to chromaffin granule and plasma membranes, joining them together to form the pentalaminar fusion complexes characteristic of the first step in exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1582536535,"A heat-labile inhibitor protein of adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) and phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.17) has been purified to apparent homogeneity from bovine brain cerebrum by a simple two-column procedure. The inhibitor exerts its effect on adenylate cyclase or phosphodiesterase by forming a complex with the Ca2+-dependent activator protein, thereby competing with the apoenzyme for the activator. The protein was estimated to have a molecular weight of 80,000 and a Stokes radius of 39 A by gel filtration. The inhibitor was resolved in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel into two equal molar subunits, with molecular weights of 60,000 and 18,500. In the presence of the activator and Ca2+, the thermal stability of the inhibitor was increased, indicative of a new conformation. The effectiveness of the inhibitor varied considerably, depending on its sequence of addition to the reaction mixture relative to phosphodiesterase and the activator protein, presumably because the activator appeared to have a greater affinity for the inhibitor than for phosphodiesterase."

https://openalex.org/W2064437942,"The mouse mutant genes obese (ob) and diabetes (db) cause similar obesity-diabetes states in homozygotes. These obesity syndromes are characterized by a more efficient conversion of food to lipid and, once stored, a slower rate of catabolism on fasting. Heterozygous mice, either ob/+ or db/+, survived a prolonged fast significantly longer than normal homozygotes (+/+); this suggests that the heterozygotes exhibited increased metabolic efficiency, a feature normally associated with both homozygous mutants. The existence of this thriftiness trait, if manifested by heterozygous carriers in wild populations, would lend credence to the thrifty gene concept of diabetes. Beneficial effects of normally deleterious genes may have played a role in the development of diabetes-susceptible human populations, as well as having provided the survival advantage that has allowed both the development and successful establishment of species in desert and other less affluent regions."
https://openalex.org/W1561546469,"A system for in situ perfusion of rat hindquarters using a fluorocarbon for oxygen and CO2 exchange, and a polyol to provide oncotic pressure is described. Perfusion with glucose plus insulin resulted in no significant change in the tissue level of citrate cycle intermediates, phosphocreatine, ATP, ADP, AMP, and glycogen. Glucose was consumed at a linear rate, and lactate, pyruvate, alanine, glutamine, glutamate, and citrate were released into the perfusing medium. Inclusion of pyruvate resulted in elevation of citrate cycle intermediates and alanine, whereas acetate elevated the level of cycle intermediates without significant effect on tissue alanine or its release. Radioactivity from NaH[14C]O3 was incorporated into citrate cycle intermediates, glutamate, aspartate, and lactate by glucose-perfused hindquarters, the extent of which was markedly elevated as the tissue pyruvate was increased. When pyruvate was in the physiological range, acetate caused elevation in incorporation of CO2 into these metabolites, increased the concentration of citrate, and doubled the concentration of acetyl-CoA. Thirty-five to forty-four per cent of 14C incorporated into citrate was retained after enzymic degradation to 2-oxoglutarate. Perfusion with [2-14C-]propionate led to elevation in the level of citrate cycle intermediates, and radioactivity was incorporated into the latter, as well as glutamate, aspartate, lactate, pyruvate, alanine, and CO2. Two independent calculations estimated the rate of flux of 4-carbon cycle intermediates to 3-carbon metabolites of about 68 mumol/h (approximately 38 nmol/min/g of tissue), a rate in excess of those reported for alanine release from human or rat muscle during starvation. Arsenite blocked carbohydrate flux through the citrate cycle and effected accumulation of lactate, pyruvate, alanine, and 2-oxoglutarate. Flux from 4- to 3-carbon acids was diminished by arsenite, apparently as a result of lowered substrate concentration for decarboxylation. 3-Mercaptopicolinic acid, an inhibitor of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, was without effect on the parameters studied, suggesting that this enzyme is not involved in the decarboxylation reaction. It is concluded that (a) a constant level of citrate cycle intermediates is maintained in part by continuous flux of carbon into and out of the cycle by carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions; (b) the carbon skeleton of alanine released from skeletal muscle is derived in part from other amino acids which are catabolized to cycle intermediates; and (c) the subsequent removal of these intermediates is probably mediated by malic enzyme(s) (EC 1.1.1.40, or 1.1.1.36, or both."
https://openalex.org/W1594701033,"Abstract Several molecular weight forms of plasminogen activator (PA) activity have been observed in serum-free conditioned media from human cells in culture. An antibody inhibition technique is described which combines inhibition of enzyme activity by anti-urokinase IgG with sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis to determine whether different molecular weight forms of human cell PA's are immunologically related to urokinase. Plasminogen activator forms with molecular weights of 85,000 to 95,000, 50,000 to 60,000, and 36,000 were inhibited by anti-urokinase IgG. In contrast, PA forms with molecular weights in the 73,000 range from three different types of human cells were not inhibited by comparable concentrations of the antibody. Human embryonic kidney cultures contain only anti-urokinase IgG-inhibitable PA forms, while melanoma-derived Malme-3M cultures contain only anti-urokinase IgG-resistant forms. Cultures of tumorigenic Detroit 562 cells and nontumorigenic IMR-90 cells contain a mixture of antibody-sensitive and PA forms. The antibody-resistant 73,000-dalton PA form may be a precursor of the smaller antibody-sensitive, urokinase-related forms, or it may be the product of a second plasminogen activator gene which codes for a protein immunologically and structurally different from urokinase."

https://openalex.org/W1529417609,"Mice homozygous for the nb (normoblastosis) gene have severe hemolytic anemia characterized by in- creased catabolism of hemoglobin. Heme biosynthesis and catabolism were measured in the tissues of homo- zygous (nb/nb), heterozygous (+/nb), and control (+ / +) mice generated on the same genetic background. The functional capacity of the microsomal hemepro- tein, cytochrome P-450, was also determined in the livers of these animals. Mice homozygous for the nb gene defect had a marked increase in protoporphyrin content, S-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-dehydratase, and uroporphyrinogen I (URO)-synthase activities in erythrocytes. Lesser in- creases were observed in liver and spleen of nb/nb mice. The homozygous mice also had a marked increase in microsomal heme oxygenase activity in the liver, kidney, and spleen compared to normal controls. The increase in heme oxygenase activity is attributable to a higher specific activity per mg of microsomal protein in the case of the liver and the kidney and to the marked organomegaly in the case of the spleen. Mice heterozygous for nb (+/nb) which do not have the overt hemolytic syndrome had normal levels of heme oxygenase activity, but elevated levels of ALA- dehydratase, URO-synthase, and protoporphyrin in blood. The increases observed in these indices in the heterozygotes were of a lesser magnitude than those observed with the nb/nb mice. The seemingly normal blood picture of the heterozygotes, therefore, probably reflects a compensated hemolytic state, as ALA-dehy- dratase, URO-synthase, and protoporphyrin levels are known to be increased in younger red cells. These enzymes and protoporphyrin were marginally increased in the liver, kidney, and spleen of the +/nb mice; heme oxygenase activity in these tissues was not altered. Both the homozygotes (nb/nb) with extensive hemolytic anemia and the heterozygotes (+/nb) with- out overt hemolysis had normal levels of microsomal cytochrome P-450 and no impairment of ethylmorphine N-demethylase or benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase activi- ties in the liver.

https://openalex.org/W1610446338,"Although the solubility of a protein is a particularly informative solution parameter, little is known about the thermodynamics of protein solubilization. In these experiments, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is used to decrease the solubility of a number of proteins in a quantifiable manner. Simple thermodynamic considerations show that if the chemical potential of the PEG-induced solid phase is constant and plots of log protein solubility versus PEG concentration are linear, a valid extrapolation of the apparent solubility to zero PEG content can be made. Given the validity of these assumptions, extrapolated values should represent the activity of the protein in saturated solution. Evidence for the validity of this extrapolation includes (a) the experimentally observed linearity of log solubility versus PEG concentration plots, (b) the extrapolation of such plots to correct activities in the situation where protein activities can be experimentally determined, and (c) the independence of the extrapolated activities on protein concentration over a wide range. The utility of the PEG-determined activities, when applied in a comparative manner, is illustrated by application to various hemoglobin solutions. It is found that saturated solutions of the various hemoglobin forms, with the exception of deoxyhemoglobin S, manifest similar activities. In addition, all of the solutions demonstrate an apparent, surprising thermodynamic ideality."
https://openalex.org/W1655141131,"Ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase forms a complex with Mn2+ and CO2 that exhibits a considerably enhanced water proton relaxation rate. This effect is diminished upon interaction of the complex with the substrate, ribulose biphosphate, or with the competitive inhibitor, ribitol 1,5-biphosphate (Ki=0.55 mM). Included among the several mechanisms which can explain these observations is the possibility that a slow exchange of metal ligands occurs. Attempts at testing the feasibility of a slow exchange mechanism led to demonstration of a stable complex of enzyme with CO2 in the presence of metal and carboxyribitol biphosphate (CRBP), an analog of the hypothetical transition state intermediate. The complex formed upon mixing these components is stable to Sephadex G-75 chromatography and contains a nonexchangeable [14C]O2 bound stoichiometrically with respect to enzyme active sites. Mg2+ or Mn2+ can be used to form the E.M.[14C]O2.CRBP complex, which is stable with respect to CO2 exchange until the enzyme is denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate. If the tight, functionally irreversible binding of the transition state analog is due to its occupancy of ribulose biphosphate and substrate CO2 sites, then simultaneous stoichiometric binding of [14C]O2 to enzyme indicates that 2 CO2 molecules participate in photosynthetic carbon fixation."
https://openalex.org/W1488584170,"The interaction of troponin-I and troponin-T was demonstrated by circular dichroism and gel filtration. Troponin-I gives a negative circular dichroism band between 300 and 260 nm while troponin-T gives two weak positive bands, one at 290 nm and the other at 263 nm. When troponin-I and troponin-T were mixed, the complex produced a strong negative circular dichroism band with a maximum around 280 nm. This band was most intense with a molar ratio of troponin-T to troponin-I of 1:1. The intensity of the band was 2.4 times that expected from the separate components. The interaction was independent of salt concentration from 0.15 to 0.5 M KCl. Gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 showed that a stable 1:1 complex was formed between troponin-T and troponin-I. When troponin-C was added to the complex of troponin-T.troponin-I; the reconstituted troponin had a circular dichroism spectrum identical to that of native troponin. The oxidation state of troponin-I was important in reconstituting troponin. Oxidized troponin-I produced less change in the near ultraviolet circular dichroism when added to troponin-T and the troponin-C than did reduced troponin-I. This showed the subunits were not assembled correctly with oxidized troponin-I. When the reconstituted complex was reduced, the circular dichroism was restored to that of native troponin. Troponin reconstituted with oxidized troponin-I did not confer calcium sensitivity on actomyosin ATPase; activity was restored by reducing the complex."

One of the resistant lines exhibited a high to normal growth rate and normal levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (mevalonate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating), EC 1.1.1.34) activity and sterol synthesis in the presence of concentrations of 25-hydroxycholesterol that caused nearly complete suppression of these functions in wild type cells. The other variant line showed partial resistance to the inhibitory effects of the diol upon cell growth, sterol synthesis, and HMG-CoA reductase activity. The resistant phenotypes remained stable when the cells were maintained in the absence of the selecting agent. The Km (HMG-CoA), thermal stability, and susceptibility to inhibition by Mg2+ and ATP of HMG-CoA reductase were unaltered in both of the resistant lines. The two lines selected for growth in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol were also resistant to the inhibitory effects of 7-ketocholesterol, 20alpha-hydroxycholesterol, and serum upon HMG-CoA reductase and sterol synthesis, suggesting that suppression of cholesterol synthesis by these inhibitors involves a common step."

https://openalex.org/W1523195528,"Glutamine 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate amidotransferase (EC 2.4.2.14), amidophosphoribosyltransferase, was partially purified from human placenta. Upon exposure to oxygen, both the glutamine and ammonia activities were lost in parallel. Inactivation by oxygen increased as the temperature of incubation rose and the partial pressure of oxygen increased. Molecular oxygen rather than a radical derivative was responsible for inactivation since scavengers of oxygen radicals did not protect against inactivation. AMP,GMP,PP-ribose-P, and inorganic phosphate partially protected both the glutamine and ammonia activities from inactivation by oxygen. Incubation with 1,10-orthophenanthroline, but not 1,7-metaphenanthroline or tiron, led to inactivation of amidophosphoribosyltransferase. Both the 1,10-orthophenanthroline- and oxygen-inactivated enzymes could be reconstituted by incubation with ferrous iron and inorganic sulfide in the presence of dithiothreitol under anaerobic conditions. The iron requirement could not be replaced by zinc, copper, cobalt, nickel, magnesium, or calcium. The sulfide requirement could not be replaced by higher concentrations of dithiothreitol. It is concluded from these studies that human amidophosphoribosyltransferase is an iron-sulfur protein and oxidation of this structure may be responsible for the marked lability of this enzyme in vitro."

Growth hormone treatment of hypophysectomized animals returned albumin mRNA to nearly normal levels. These effects on albumin mRNA sequences agreed closely with the changes in the synthesis of albumin that are assoicated with these conditions.

In addition, the complete protein side chain cleavae system (i.e. including the ancillary proteins adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase and the substrate cholesterol) can be incorporated into such membranes so that on addition of TPNH, pregnenolone is formed. These components remain in the membrane through gel filtration (which removes almost all the cholate) and sedimentation through sucrose density gradients which separate vesicles without protein and soluble enzyme from the membrane-bound P-450 remains associated with the membrane during and following lysis of vesicles. The vesicles which do not leak [14C]glucose were seen on electron microscopy to show a mean diameter of 350 to 450 A. A number of phospholipids are capable of accomodating P-450 in this manner: mitochondrial lipid extracts, synthetic dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, synthetic dipalmitoyl phosphatidylserine, and egg lecithin, separately or in various combinations. Cholesterol is not necessary for incorporation of the side chain cleavage system. Membrane-bound P-450 shows a Vmax of 28.1 nmol of pregnenolone/min/mg of protein, more than 10 times that of soluble P-450. The spectral properties of the soluble P-450 are altered to become predominantly low spin in the membrane and the enzyme is more stable at 4 degrees C than is soluble p-450."
https://openalex.org/W1582531842,"The reaction of the antitumor antibiotic anthramycin with cellular DNA and the ability of normal human fibroblasts cells and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) cells to respond to this injury has been evaluated. The binding of [15-3H]anthramycin to cellular DNA in human skin fibroblasts occurred in a linear manner up to 6 h. Treatment with unlabeled antibiotic resulted in unscheduled (repair) DNA synthesis in human skin fibroblasts maintained in hydroxyurea, whereas negligible unscheduled DNA synthesis was observed in cells of an excision-defective strain of XP. Confluent nondividing normal skin fibroblast cells were able to remove 86% of the bound anthramycin within 72 h, however XP cells were only able to remove 49% during the same incubation period. These results are discussed in terms of the types of DNA damage produced by anthramycin in vitro and the likely repair pathways involved in removing lesions produced on DNA by anthramycin."
https://openalex.org/W1497873323,"Proton and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance measurements indicate that uracil derivatives dissolved in chloroform bind to glycine and phenylalanine tripeptide derivatives through pairs of hydrogen bonds. The N(3)–H and C(4)=0 groups of the uracil ring appear to interact with the C=0 and N–H groups, respectively, of individual amino acid residues, suggesting a fundamental complementarity between uracil and the peptide backbone. The binding occurs in the same concentration range as the hydrogen bonding between derivatives of adenine and uracil under comparable conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1568851820,"The effects of the protein cesalin were studied to determine the site of its toxic action in KB cells for which the ID50 is 0.9 pg/ml. Several effects have been noted: (i) respiration in KB cells was reduced by greater than 50% within 1 h after cesalin addition, which could not be explained on the basis of mitochondrial damage or from elevated intracellular ATP levels, since these did not rise significantly until about 3 h after cesalin addition; (ii) both DNA and RNA synthesis were inhibited, starting about 3 h after addition of cesalin to KB cells, but the transport of nucleosides and amino acids does not appear to be affected; (iii) no decrease is observed in protein synthesis for at least 5 to 6 h; (iv) cesalin can inhibit DNA synthesis and mitotic division independently of one another. The interaction of cesalin with the cell surface is rapid and after 5 min at 37 degrees C less than 10% of treated cells can be rescued by addition of excess antiserum to cesalin. The cell surface receptors are exposed throughout the cell cycle and the toxicity of cesalin is not restricted to a particular phase of this cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1522300581,"Experiments of sedimentation velocity and equilibrium indicate that in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate the degree of polymerization of apohemoglobin is shifted in favor of the formation of tetramers, with a maximum effect when the concentration of the polyphosphate is 1 mM. Above this concentration, a redissociation of the system into dimers is promoted. This phenomenon is probably due to the binding of inositol hexaphosphate to apohemoglobin with a stoichiometry higher than 1 mol of polyphosphate/4 subunits. The optical rotatory dispersion spectrum of apohemoglobin is also modified by its interaction with inositol hexaphosphate suggesting a small increase in the helical content of the protein. Measurements of circular dichroism in the near-UV region of the spectrum indicate that the environment of the aromatic chromophores of the protein such as tyrosine, phenyalanine, and tryptophan is not affected by the interaction. The presence of inositol hexaphosphate decreases the rate of reaction of the beta-93 cysteinyl residues of apohemoglobin with both p-mercuribenzoate and N-ethylmaleimide, suggesting a conformational change of the protein also at the level of its tertiary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1496037268,"A double chain peptide containing the sodium borohydride-reduced intermolecular cross-link, hydroxylysinohydroxynorleucine, was isolated following sequential cyanogen bromide digestion and limited alkaline hydrolysis of insoluble calf bone collagen. Amino acid composition and NH2-terminal sequence analysis indicated that the peptide was highly acidic and consisted of 19 amino acid residues including the cross-link. Amino acid composition and automated sequence analysis of this peptide before and after cleavage of the cross-link, using periodic acid, provided the data from which the following structure was deduced. (formula: see text). The sequence of the larger peptide is identical with that of residues 8c to 19c in the COOH-terminal nonhelical region of the homologous skin collagen alpha1 chain. The hydroxylysine residue located at position 17c in the alpha chain of type I collagen appears to be a predominant site for intermolecular cross-link formation. Assignment of the smaller peptide component within the known primary structure of the collagen molecule currently cannot be made."
