https://openalex.org/W2980286315,"Cognition and behavior emerge from brain network interactions, such that investigating causal interactions should be central to the study of brain function. Approaches that characterize statistical associations among neural time series-functional connectivity (FC) methods-are likely a good starting point for estimating brain network interactions. Yet only a subset of FC methods ('effective connectivity') is explicitly designed to infer causal interactions from statistical associations. Here we incorporate best practices from diverse areas of FC research to illustrate how FC methods can be refined to improve inferences about neural mechanisms, with properties of causal neural interactions as a common ontology to facilitate cumulative progress across FC approaches. We further demonstrate how the most common FC measures (correlation and coherence) reduce the set of likely causal models, facilitating causal inferences despite major limitations. Alternative FC measures are suggested to immediately start improving causal inferences beyond these common FC measures."
https://openalex.org/W2979370432,"Blood vessels in the CNS form a specialized and critical structure, the blood–brain barrier (BBB). We present a resource to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate BBB function in health and dysfunction during disease. Using endothelial cell enrichment and RNA sequencing, we analyzed the gene expression of endothelial cells in mice, comparing brain endothelial cells with peripheral endothelial cells. We also assessed the regulation of CNS endothelial gene expression in models of stroke, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and seizure, each having profound BBB disruption. We found that although each is caused by a distinct trigger, they exhibit strikingly similar endothelial gene expression changes during BBB disruption, comprising a core BBB dysfunction module that shifts the CNS endothelial cells into a peripheral endothelial cell-like state. The identification of a common pathway for BBB dysfunction suggests that targeting therapeutic agents to limit it may be effective across multiple neurological disorders. Munji et al. analyzed the transcriptomes of endothelial cells from multiple organs and in neural tissue of neurological disease models. They identified a blood–brain barrier dysfunction module in seizure, multiple sclerosis, stroke and brain trauma."
https://openalex.org/W2980938713,"In recent years, the use of a large number of object concepts and naturalistic object images has been growing strongly in cognitive neuroscience research. Classical databases of object concepts are based mostly on a manually curated set of concepts. Further, databases of naturalistic object images typically consist of single images of objects cropped from their background, or a large number of naturalistic images of varying quality, requiring elaborate manual image curation. Here we provide a set of 1,854 diverse object concepts sampled systematically from concrete picturable and nameable nouns in the American English language. Using these object concepts, we conducted a large-scale web image search to compile a database of 26,107 high-quality naturalistic images of those objects, with 12 or more object images per concept and all images cropped to square size. Using crowdsourcing, we provide higher-level category membership for the 27 most common categories and validate them by relating them to representations in a semantic embedding derived from large text corpora. Finally, by feeding images through a deep convolutional neural network, we demonstrate that they exhibit high selectivity for different object concepts, while at the same time preserving variability of different object images within each concept. Together, the THINGS database provides a rich resource of object concepts and object images and offers a tool for both systematic and large-scale naturalistic research in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and computer science."
https://openalex.org/W2979655670,"Basal amygdala (BA) neurons guide associative learning via acquisition of responses to stimuli that predict salient appetitive or aversive outcomes. We examined the learning- and state-dependent dynamics of BA neurons and ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) axons that innervate BA (VTADA→BA) using two-photon imaging and photometry in behaving mice. BA neurons did not respond to arbitrary visual stimuli, but acquired responses to stimuli that predicted either rewards or punishments. Most VTADA→BA axons were activated by both rewards and punishments, and they acquired responses to cues predicting these outcomes during learning. Responses to cues predicting food rewards in VTADA→BA axons and BA neurons in hungry mice were strongly attenuated following satiation, while responses to cues predicting unavoidable punishments persisted or increased. Therefore, VTADA→BA axons may provide a reinforcement signal of motivational salience that invigorates adaptive behaviors by promoting learned responses to appetitive or aversive cues in distinct, intermingled sets of BA excitatory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2979752717,"The increased legal availability of cannabis has led to a common misconception that it is a safe natural remedy for, among others, pregnancy-related ailments such as morning sickness. Emerging clinical evidence, however, indicates that prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) predisposes offspring to various neuropsychiatric disorders linked to aberrant dopaminergic function. Yet, our knowledge of how cannabis exposure affects the maturation of this neuromodulatory system remains limited. Here, we show that male, but not female, offspring of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-exposed dams, a rat PCE model, exhibit extensive molecular and synaptic changes in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area, including altered excitatory-to-inhibitory balance and switched polarity of long-term synaptic plasticity. The resulting hyperdopaminergic state leads to increased behavioral sensitivity to acute THC exposure during pre-adolescence. The neurosteroid pregnenolone, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug, rescues synaptic defects and normalizes dopaminergic activity and behavior in PCE offspring, thus suggesting a therapeutic approach for offspring exposed to cannabis during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2980884646,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has begun a public process to redefine how companies are allowed to use the term ""healthy"" on food packages. Although the definition is formulated based on the latest consensus in nutrition and epidemiological research, it is also important to understand how consumers define and understand the term if it is to be behaviorally relevant. This research is an exploratory study designed to provide a descriptive account of consumers' perceptions of and beliefs about the meaning of ""healthy"" food.A nationwide U.S. sample of 1,290 food consumers was surveyed in December 2018. Respondents answered 15 questions designed to gauge perceptions of healthy food and to elicit preference for policies surrounding healthy food definitions. Responses are weighted to demographically match the population. Categorical variables have a sampling error of ±2.7%. Exploratory factor analysis is used to determine latent dimensions of health perceptions related to food type.Consumers were about evenly split on whether a food can be deemed healthy based solely on the foods' nutritional content (52.1% believing as such) or whether there were other factors that affect whether a food is healthy (47.9% believing as such). Consumers were also about evenly split on whether an individual food can be considered healthy (believed by 47.9%) or whether this healthiness is instead a characteristic of one's overall diet (believed by 52.1%). Ratings of individual food products revealed that ""healthy"" perceptions are comprised of at least three underlying latent dimensions related to animal origin, preservation, and freshness/processing. Focusing on individual macronutrients, perceived healthiness was generally decreasing in a food's fat, sodium, and carbohydrate content and increasing in protein content. About 40% of consumers thought a healthy label implied they should increase consumption of the type of food bearing the label and about 15% thought the label meant they could eat all they wanted.Results suggest consumer's perceptions of ""healthy,"" which is primarily based on fat content, partially aligns with the FDA definition but also suggest consumers perceive the word as a broader and more nuanced concept that defies easy, uniform definition. Results highlight areas where nutrition education may be needed and suggest disclosures may need to accompany health claims so that consumers know what, precisely, is being communicated."
https://openalex.org/W2981125990,"'Gold standard' reference sets of human muscle architecture are based on elderly cadaveric specimens, which are unlikely to be representative of a large proportion of the human population. This is important for musculoskeletal modeling, where the muscle force-generating properties of generic models are defined by these data but may not be valid when applied to models of young, healthy individuals. Obtaining individualized muscle architecture data in vivo is difficult, however diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) has recently emerged as a valid method of achieving this. DTI was used here to provide an architecture data set of 20 lower limb muscles from 10 healthy adults, including muscle fiber lengths, which are important inputs for Hill-type muscle models commonly used in musculoskeletal modeling. Maximum isometric force and muscle fiber lengths were found not to scale with subject anthropometry, suggesting that these factors may be difficult to predict using scaling or optimization algorithms. These data also highlight the high level of anatomical variation that exists between individuals in terms of lower limb muscle architecture, which supports the need of incorporating subject-specific force-generating properties into musculoskeletal models to optimize their accuracy for clinical evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2981124940,"Background Guidance and frameworks exist to assist those developing health interventions but may offer limited discussion of ‘design’, the part of development concerned with generating ideas for and making decisions about an intervention’s content, format and delivery. The aim of this paper is to describe and understand the views and experiences of developers and associated stakeholders in relation to how design occurs in health intervention development. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 people who had developed complex interventions to improve health and/or who were relevant stakeholders (e.g. funders and publishers of intervention development work), regarding their views, experiences and approaches to intervention design. Sampling was purposive in terms of maximising diversity. A thematic inductive analysis was conducted. Results Approaches to design varied substantially between intervention developers. This contrasted with consistency in other activities undertaken during development, such as literature review. Design also posed more challenges than other parts of development. We identified six ‘modes’ of design: informed; negotiated; structured; delegated; ‘my baby’; and creative partnership. In understanding the differences between these different modes, and the challenges posed by intervention design, we identified three key themes: enabling creativity during the design process; working with different types of knowledge; and ‘stabilising’ (developing clear shared understandings of) the intervention development to enable design. Conclusions Design has received less attention than other activities undertaken when developing interventions to improve health. Developers take a variety of approaches to design and often find it challenging. Guidance for intervention development in health has tended to see design as proceeding in a predictable and controlled manner from acquired knowledge. Our study suggests that design rarely reflects this rational ideal. Future guidance on intervention development in healthcare should support developers to work effectively with different types of knowledge, to help design progress more smoothly and to maximise creativity."
https://openalex.org/W2981265021,"The current study aimed to identify the radiosensitizing effect of celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, in combination with radiotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. The combination of celecoxib potentiated radiation-induced apoptosis; however, no changes in cell cycle distribution and number of phosphorylated histone H2AX foci were detected, indicating a DNA damage-independent mechanism. In an in vivo mouse model, the tumor size was significantly decreased in the group combining celecoxib with radiation compared with the radiation only group. Phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as well as expression of COX-2 were significantly downregulated in cells treated with the combination of celecoxib and radiation compared with the radiation only group. The result indicated that celecoxib exhibits radiosensitizing effects through COX-2 and Akt/mTOR-dependent mechanisms. Induction the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway promotes radioresistance in various cancers, including NSCLC. Therefore, the current study suggested the therapeutic potential of combination therapy of celecoxib and radiation in the prevention of radioresistance."
https://openalex.org/W2980440799,"During the stringent response, bacteria synthesize guanosine-3’,5’-bis(diphosphate) (ppGpp) and guanosine-5’-triphosphate 3’-diphosphate (pppGpp), which act as secondary messengers to promote cellular survival and adaptation. (p)ppGpp ‘alarmones’ are synthesized and/or hydrolyzed by proteins belonging to the RelA/SpoT Homologue (RSH) family. Many bacteria also encode ‘small alarmone synthetase’ (SAS) proteins (e.g. RelP, RelQ) which may also be capable of synthesizing a third alarmone: guanosine-5’-phosphate 3’-diphosphate (pGpp). Here, we report the biochemical properties of the Rel (RSH), RelP and RelQ proteins from Staphylococcus aureus (Sa-Rel, Sa-RelP, Sa-RelQ, respectively). Sa-Rel synthesized pppGpp more efficiently than ppGpp, but lacked the ability to produce pGpp. Sa-Rel efficiently hydrolyzed all three alarmones in a Mn(II) ion-dependent manner. The removal of the C-terminal regulatory domain of Sa-Rel increased its rate of (p)ppGpp synthesis ca. 10-fold, but had negligible effects on its rate of (pp)pGpp hydrolysis. Sa-RelP and Sa-RelQ efficiently synthesized pGpp in addition to pppGpp and ppGpp. The alarmone-synthesizing abilities of Sa-RelQ, but not Sa-RelP, were allosterically-stimulated by the addition of pppGpp, ppGpp or pGpp. The respective (pp)pGpp-synthesizing activities of Sa-RelP/Sa-RelQ were compared and contrasted with SAS homologues from Enterococcus faecalis (Ef-RelQ) and Streptococcus mutans (Sm-RelQ, Sm-RelP). Results indicated that EF-RelQ, Sm-RelQ and Sa-RelQ were functionally equivalent; but exhibited considerable variations in their respective biochemical properties, and the degrees to which alarmones and single-stranded RNA molecules allosterically modulated their respective alarmone-synthesizing activities. The respective (pp)pGpp-synthesizing capabilities of Sa-RelP and Sm-RelP proteins were inhibited by pGpp, ppGpp and pppGpp. Our results support the premise that RelP and RelQ proteins may synthesize pGpp in addition to (p)ppGpp within S. aureus and other Gram-positive bacterial species."
https://openalex.org/W2980463740,"Background Bartonellae are intracellular bacteria, which can cause persistent bacteraemia in humans and a variety of animals. Several rodent-associated Bartonella species are human pathogens but data on their global distribution and epidemiology are limited. The aims of the study were to: 1) determine the prevalence of Bartonella infection in rodents and fleas; 2) identify risk factors for Bartonella infection in rodents; and 3) characterize the Bartonella genotypes present in these rodent and flea populations. Methods and results Spleen samples collected from 381 rodents representing six different species were tested for the presence of Bartonella DNA, which was detected in 57 individuals (15.0%; 95% CI 11.3–18.5), of three rodent species (Rattus rattus n = 54, Mastomys natalensis n = 2 and Paraxerus flavovottis n = 1) using a qPCR targeting the ssrA gene. Considering R. rattus individuals only, risk factor analysis indicated that Bartonella infection was more likely in reproductively mature as compared to immature individuals (OR = 3.42, p <0.001). Bartonella DNA was also detected in 53 of 193 Xenopsylla cheopis fleas (27.5%: 95% CI 21.3–34.3) collected from R.rattus individuals. Analysis of ssrA and gltA sequences from rodent spleens and ssrA sequences from fleas identified multiple genotypes closely related (≥ 97% similar) to several known or suspected zoonotic Bartonella species, including B. tribocorum, B. rochalimae, B. elizabethae and B. quintana. Conclusions The ssrA and gltA sequences obtained from rodent spleens and ssrA sequences obtained from fleas reveal the presence of a diverse set of Bartonella genotypes and increase our understanding of the bartonellae present in Tanzanian. Further studies are needed to fully characterise the prevalence, genotypes and diversity of Bartonella in different host populations and their potential impacts on human health."
https://openalex.org/W2980701977,"Recently it was discovered that tissue-resident macrophages derive from embryonic precursors, not only from peripheral blood monocytes, and maintain themselves by self-renewal. Most in-vitro studies on macrophage biology make use of in-vitro cultured human monocyte-derived macrophages. Phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized particles by tissue-resident macrophages takes place via interaction with IgG receptors, the Fc-gamma receptors (FcγRs). We investigated the FcγR expression on macrophages both in-vivo and ex-vivo from different human tissues. Upon isolation of primary human macrophages from bone marrow, spleen, liver and lung, we observed that macrophages from all studied tissues expressed high levels of FcγRIII, which was in direct contrast with the low expression on blood monocyte-derived macrophages. Expression levels of FcγRI were highly variable, with bone marrow macrophages showing the lowest and alveolar macrophages the highest expression. Kupffer cells in the liver were the only tissue-resident macrophages that expressed the inhibitory IgG receptor, FcγRIIB. This inhibitory receptor was also found to be expressed by sinusoidal endothelial cells in the liver. In sum, our immunofluorescence data combined with ex-vivo stainings of isolated macrophages indicated that tissue-resident macrophages are remarkably unique and different from monocyte-derived macrophages in their phenotypic expression of IgG receptors. Tissue macrophages show distinct tissue-specific FcγR expression patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2980732029,"The advancing age of the participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)—Potsdam study was the incentive to investigate frailty as a major parameter of ageing. The aim of this study was to develop a multidimensional tool to measure frailty in an ageing, free-living study population. The “accumulation of deficits approach” was used to develop a frailty index (FI) to characterize a sub-sample (N = 815) of the EPIC-Potsdam (EPIC-P) study population regarding the aging phenomenon. The EPIC-P frailty index (EPIC-P-FI) included 32 variables from the following domains: health, physical ability, psychosocial and physiological aspects. P–values were calculated for the linear trend between sociodemographic and life style variables and the EPIC-P-FI was calculated using regression analysis adjusted for age. The relationship between the EPIC-P-FI and age was investigated using fractional polynomials. Some characteristics such as age, education, time spent watching TV, cycling and a biomarker of inflammation (C-reactive protein) were associated with frailty in men and women. Interestingly, living alone, having no partner and smoking status were only associated with frailty in men, and alcohol use and physical fitness (VO2max) only in women. The generated, multidimensional FI, adapted to the EPIC-P study, showed that this cohort is a valuable source for further exploration of factors that promote healthy ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2980821978,"Societal expectations of self-care and responsible actions toward others may produce bias against those who engage in perceived self-harming behavior. This is especially true for health professionals, who have dedicated themselves to helping reduce the burden of illness and suffering. Research has shown that writing narratives can increase perspective taking and empathy toward other people, which may engender more positive attitudes. Two studies examined whether creating a fictional narrative about a woman who smokes cigarettes while pregnant could increase positive attitudes toward the woman who smokes and reduce the internal attributions made for her behavior. Across both experiments, the narrative writing intervention increased participants’ empathy and perspective taking, evoked more positive attitudes toward a woman who smokes cigarettes while pregnant, and increased external attributions for her behavior. This work supports our hypothesis that narrative writing would be an efficacious intervention promoting attitude change toward patients who engage in unhealthy, and often contentious, behaviors. This work also suggests that narrative writing could be a useful intervention for medical professionals and policy makers leading to more informed policy or treatment recommendations, encouraging empathy for patients, and engendering a stronger consideration of how external forces can play a role in someone’s seemingly irresponsible behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2981009181,"The aim of this study was to evaluate Egyptian date palm pollen (DPP) grains composition, physical and functional potentials in comparing with two forms; 80% ethanol extract, and nanoencapsulated form. Functional yoghurt fortified with DPP in three forms was prepared and their physicochemical, microstructure, texture and sensory characteristics were assessed. The micro morphology was explored via Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed for functional groups detection. Phenolic compounds were detected by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) while fatty acids were identified via Gas Liquid Chromatography (GLC). Cytotoxicity of DPP nanocapsules was evaluated against RPE1 cell line (BJ1). The Egyptian date palm pollen grains evaluation revealed its rich content of protein and carbohydrate (36.28 and 17.14 g/ 100g), high content of Fe, Zn and Mg (226.5, 124.4 and 318 mg/100g), unsaturated fatty acids ω-3, ω-6 and ω-9 (8.76, 20.26 and 7.11 g/100g, which was increased by ethanol extraction) and phenolic compounds especially catechin (191.73 μg/mL) which was pronounced in DPP antioxidant potentials (IC50 35.54 mg/g). The FTIR analyses indicated the presence of soluble amides (proteins) and polysaccharides (fibers) functional groups in DPP. Fortification with nanoencapsulated DPP proved to be safe and the recommended form due to the announced positive characteristics. Yoghurt fortification with DPP forms enhanced viscosity, syneresis and Water Holding Capacity (WHC), which can be considered a symbiotic functional product as it contained both probiotics (106 CFU/g) and prebiotics represented in DPP forms."

https://openalex.org/W2980590505,"Most connectivity metrics in neuroimaging research reduce multivariate activity patterns in regions-of-interests (ROIs) to one dimension, which leads to a loss of information. Importantly, it prevents us from investigating the transformations between patterns in different ROIs. Here, we applied linear estimation theory in order to robustly estimate the linear transformations between multivariate fMRI patterns with a cross-validated ridge regression approach. We used three functional connectivity metrics that describe different features of these voxel-by-voxel mappings: goodness-of-fit, sparsity and pattern deformation. The goodness-of-fit describes the degree to which the patterns in an input region can be described as a linear transformation of patterns in an output region. The sparsity metric, which relies on a Monte Carlo procedure, was introduced in order to test whether the transformation mostly consists of one-to-one mappings between voxels in different regions. Furthermore, we defined a metric for pattern deformation, i.e. the degree to which the transformation rotates or rescales the input patterns. As a proof of concept, we applied these metrics to an event-related fMRI data set consisting of four subjects that has been used in previous studies. We focused on the transformations from early visual cortex (EVC) to inferior temporal cortex (ITC), fusiform face area (FFA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA). Our results suggest that the estimated linear mappings explain a significant amount of response variance in the three output ROIs. The transformation from EVC to ITC shows the highest goodness-of-fit, and those from EVC to FFA and PPA show the expected preference for faces and places as well as animate and inanimate objects, respectively. The pattern transformations are sparse, but sparsity is lower than would have been expected for one-to-one mappings, thus suggesting the presence of one-to-few voxel mappings. The mappings are also characterised by different levels of pattern deformations, thus indicating that the transformations differentially amplify or dampen certain dimensions of the input patterns. While our results are only based on a small number of subjects, they show that our pattern transformation metrics can describe novel aspects of multivariate functional connectivity in neuroimaging data."
https://openalex.org/W2980980586,"Cell Sheet (CS) Engineering is a regenerative medicine strategy proposed for the treatment of injured or diseased organs and tissues. In fact, several clinical trials are underway using CS-based methodologies. However, the clinical application of such cell-based methodologies poses several challenges related with the preservation of CS structure and function from the fabrication site to the bedside. Pausing cells at hypothermic temperatures has been suggested as a valuable method for short-term cell preservation. In this study, we tested the efficiency of two preservation strategies, one using culture medium supplementation with Rokepie and the other using the preservation solution Hypothermosol, in preserving human adipose stromal/stem cells (hASC) CS-like confluent cultures at 4°C, during 3 and 7 days. Both preservation strategies demonstrated excellent ability to preserve cell function during the first 3 days in hypothermia, as demonstrated by metabolic activity results and assessment of extracellular matrix integrity and differentiation potential. At the end of the 7th day of hypothermic incubation, the decrease in cell metabolic activity was more evident for all conditions. Nonetheless, hASC incubated with Rokepie and Hypothermosol retained a higher metabolic activity and extracellular matrix integrity in comparison with unsupplemented cells. Differentiation results for the later time point showed that supplementation with both Rokepie and Hypothermosol rescued adipogenic differentiation potential but only Rokepie was able to preserve hASC osteogenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2981211097,"The soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, is the most damaging pathogen of soybeans in the United States. To assess the severity of nematode infestations in the field, SCN egg population densities are determined. Cysts (dead females) of the nematode must be extracted from soil samples and then ground to extract the eggs within. Sucrose centrifugation commonly is used to separate debris from suspensions of extracted nematode eggs. We present a method using OptiPrep as a density gradient medium with improved separation and recovery of extracted eggs compared to the sucrose centrifugation technique. Also, computerized methods were developed to automate the identification and counting of nematode eggs from the processed samples. In one approach, a high-resolution scanner was used to take static images of extracted eggs and debris on filter papers, and a deep learning network was trained to identify and count the eggs among the debris. In the second approach, a lensless imaging setup was developed using off-the-shelf components, and the processed egg samples were passed through a microfluidic flow chip made from double-sided adhesive tape. Holographic videos were recorded of the passing eggs and debris, and the videos were reconstructed and processed by custom software program to obtain egg counts. The performance of the software programs for egg counting was characterized with SCN-infested soil collected from two farms, and the results using these methods were compared with those obtained through manual counting."
https://openalex.org/W2981217742,"Purpose To compare and validate the accuracy and ease of use of handheld autorefractors against retinoscopic refraction by an ophthalmologist for assessing the visual acuity of older adults in India. Methods 190 patients were enrolled at the Sankara Eye Hospital in Bangalore, India, to undergo refraction using three different handheld devices—Retinomax (Nikon Inc., Japan), Netra (Eyenetra, Inc., USA), and QuickSee (PlenOptika, Inc., USA)—and the results were compared with cycloplegic retinoscopy and refraction done by an ophthalmologist. We analyzed the mean, standard deviation (S.D.), and Bland-Altman comparison of dioptric (D) power accuracy. Results The difference between the handheld devices and subjective refraction for each device was: Retinomax (N = 186), mean -0.41 D, S.D. 2.14; Netra (N = 179), mean 0.61 D, S.D. 2.20; and QuickSee (N = 182), mean -0.05 D, S.D. 1.04. Conclusion The QuickSee and the Retinomax may be used successfully as refraction screening tools in epidemiologic studies of adults in India and as diagnostic tools in low-resource settings."

The study included control (C = 27), paired (P = 16) and Cushing’s disease (CD = 10) groups, which underwent biochemical assessment, dual X-ray absorptiometry, TBS, and magnetic resonance imaging to determine fat deposits. The CD group showed higher serum levels of glucose and insulin, as well as HOMA-IR values, but lower circulatory levels of osteocalcin, in comparison to C and P. The CD group exhibited lower L1-L4 BMD than P (P = 1.059 ± 0.141 vs CD = 0.935 ± 0.093 g/cm2, p < 0.05) (Fig 1A). The lumbar spine BMD from the C group was similar to the other groups. TBS was lower in CD than in P and C (C = 1.512±0.077 vs P = 1.405±0.150 vs CD = 1.135±0.136; p<0.05); there was also significant difference between C and P (p<0.05). MAT, VAT, and IHL were higher in CD than in C and P (p<0.05). Considering all subjects, there was a positive association between TBS with both lumbar spine BMD (R2 = 0.45; p<0.0001) and osteocalcin (R2 = 0.44; p = 0.05). TBS was negatively associated with MAT (R2 = 0.49; p = 0.01), VAT (R2 = 0.55; p<0.05), and HOMA-IR (R2 = 0.44; p<0.01). MAT was positively related with VAT (R2 = 0.44; p<0.01) and IHL (R2 = 0.41; p<0.05). In CD, insulin resistance and adipose tissue dysfunction, including high MAT, are active players in bone deterioration, as confirmed by lower lumbar spine BMD and lower TBS. Thus, our findings point to an additional component of the already well-known complex mechanisms of osteoporosis associated with hypercortisolism."
https://openalex.org/W2980982623,"Deregulation of proteostasis is a main feature of many age-related diseases, often leading to the accumulation of toxic oligomers and insoluble protein aggregates that accumulate intracellularly or in the extracellular space. To understand the mechanisms whereby toxic or otherwise unwanted proteins are secreted to the extracellular space, we inactivated the quality-control and proteostasis regulator ubiquitin ligase STUB1/CHIP. Data indicated that STUB1 deficiency leads both to the intracellular accumulation of protein aggregates and to an increase in the secretion of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), including exosomes. Secreted sEVs are enriched in ubiquitinated and/or undegraded proteins and protein oligomers. Data also indicates that oxidative stress induces an increase in the release of sEVs in cells depleted from STUB1. Overall, the results presented here suggest that cells use exosomes to dispose of damaged and/or undegraded proteins as a means to reduce intracellular accumulation of proteotoxic material."

The purpose of this study is to increase understanding of the childhood conditions, pathways to entertainment work and current practices of female entertainment workers (FEWs) in Cambodia.Data used for this study were collected in April 2018 as part of the baseline survey of the Mobile Link, a randomized controlled trial to improve sexual and reproductive health of FEWs in Cambodia. We used a stratified random sampling method to recruit 600 FEWs for face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive analyses were performed.Most participants came from childhood homes without electricity (82.0%) or running water (87.0%). Most women moved to the city in the last ten years (80.5%) for economic reasons (43.7%). About a third worked in the garment industry prior to the entertainment industry (36.7%). Participation in transactional sex in the past three months was reported by 36.0%. Women reported low condom use practices with non-paying partners (23.4% used a condom at last sex), excessive and forced alcohol use at work (33.1% reported being forced to drink alcohol at work more than once a month), low modern contraception use (31.4% was using modern contraception), and experiences of gender-based violence (23.3% reported verbal threats, physical abuse or forced sex in the past six months).This information will help to support the development of future individual and structural level interventions for the safety and support of FEWs. In addition, these results may contribute to an evidence base that can inform policy level changes intended to support the realization of full human rights for entertainment works in Cambodia including the rights to health, safety and respectful employment."
https://openalex.org/W2980756182,"Background In Ethiopia malaria is one of the leading causes of outpatient visits and admission. Still, it remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the study area. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the knowledge, practice, and determinant of malaria case households in rural areas of Raya Azebo district, Northern Ethiopia. Method A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in the selected villages of Raya Azebo district from January to June 2017. A multi-stage random sampling method was employed to select a total of 422 study households. Data was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. The household head was interviewed face to face. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the determinant of malaria cases households. Result A total of 412 (97.6) of the respondents had ever heard about malaria. About 63% of households recognized the causes of malaria to be a mosquito bite. Around 173 (41%) of the study households had been treated for malaria within a year of data collection. This study also revealed that the presence of mosquito breeding sites near to home, bed bug infestation, outdoor sleep due to bed bugs and household with poor bed net practicing were significantly associated with malaria case households. Conclusion Although the overall knowledge on malaria transmission, symptoms, and the preventive measure was relatively good, the rate of household insecticide-treated net coverage and utilization were reported low in the area. Therefore, the distribution of adequate bed net with community-based education is a key intervention to promote household insecticide-treated net utilization. In addition, an effective bed bug management strategy is necessary to overcome the outdoor sleeping habit of the community in the area."
https://openalex.org/W2980768391,"In recent years, several studies have indicated that healthy older adults exhibit a reduction in task-unrelated thoughts compared to young adults. However, much less is known regarding age-related differences in time spent engaging in stimulus-independent thoughts or in their neural correlates in the absence of an ongoing task. In the current study, we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while 29 young (mean age = 22y) and 22 older (mean age = 70y) adults underwent experience sampling in the absence of an ongoing task (i.e., at “rest”). Although both age groups reported spending a similar amount of time engaged in stimulus-independent thoughts, older adults rated their thoughts as more present-oriented (rather than atemporal) and more novel. Moreover, controlling for these age-related differences in content, we found that experiencing stimulus-independent thoughts was associated with increased posterior cingulate and left angular gyrus activation across age groups compared to exhibiting an external focus of attention. When experiencing stimulus-independent thoughts, younger adults engaged medial and left lateral prefrontal cortex as well as left superior temporal gyrus to a greater degree than older adults. Taken together, our results suggest that, in the absence of an ongoing task, although young and older adults spend a similar amount of time engaging in stimulus-independent thoughts, the content and neural correlates of these thoughts differ with age."
https://openalex.org/W2980447986,"Studies have shown a high risk of tumor development within a bladder diverticulum (BD). We were interested in the relationship between BD and the development of bladder cancer. Herein, we attempted to investigate whether there exists an association between documented BD and subsequent risk of bladder cancer.We identified 10,662 hospitalized urology patients, including 2,134 documented BD patients (study cohort) and 8,528 non-BD subjects (comparison cohort) from Taiwan's National Health Insurance database. Only urology patients were enrolled in the study to minimize selection bias. The two cohorts were frequency-matched 1:4 by age, sex and index-year. Patients with less than one year of follow-up were excluded to avoid inverting cause and effect. Risks of developing bladder cancer were estimated using the Cox proportional hazard regression model.There was an increased bladder cancer risk in the documented BD patients. The incidence of bladder cancer in documented BD patients was 2.60-fold higher than that in the comparison group, and the overall risk-factor-adjusted hazard ratio was 2.63 (95% CI, 1.74-3.97). Moreover, stratified analysis by sex also showed that documented BD patients were at higher risk of subsequent bladder cancer than the comparison cohort. The effect of BD on the risk of bladder cancer was higher in males than in females and was more profound in patients without comorbidities than in those with comorbidities.In this population-based longitudinal study, urology patients with documented BD might have an elevated risk of subsequent bladder cancer. Based on the limitations of the retrospective study design, further studies are required."
https://openalex.org/W2981098492,"Although routine health care and clinical trials usually require the documentation of similar information, data collection is performed independently from each other, resulting in redundant documentation efforts. Standardizing routine documentation can enable secondary use for medical research. Neuroinflammatory demyelinating diseases (NIDs) represent a heterogeneous group of diseases requiring further research to improve patient management. The aim of this work is to develop, implement and evaluate a minimal core dataset in routine health care with a focus on secondary use as case study for NIDs. Therefore, a draft minimal core dataset for NIDs was created by analyzing routine, clinical trial, registry, biobank documentation and existing data standards for NIDs. Data elements (DEs) were converted into the standard format Operational Data Model, semantically annotated and analyzed via frequency analysis. The analysis produced 1958 DEs based on 864 distinct medical concepts. After review and finalization by an interdisciplinary team of neurologists, epidemiologists and medical computer scientists, the minimal core dataset (NID CDEs) consists of 46 common DEs capturing disease-specific information for reuse in the discharge letter and other research settings. It covers the areas of diagnosis, laboratory results, disease progress, expanded disability status scale, therapy and magnetic resonance imaging findings. NID CDEs was implemented in two German university hospitals and a usability study in clinical routine was conducted (participants n = 16) showing a good usability (Mean SUS = 75). From May 2017 to February 2018, 755 patients were documented with the NID CDEs, which indicates the feasibility of developing a minimal core dataset for structured documentation based on previously used documentation standards and integrating the dataset into clinical routine. By sharing, translating and reusing the minimal dataset, a transnational harmonized documentation of patients with NIDs might be realized, supporting interoperability in medical research."
https://openalex.org/W2980616956,"Activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, is a critical modulator of inflammation and plays a key role in controlling the cytokine cascade that drives the inflammatory response. However, the role of activin A in inflammatory kidney diseases remains unknown. To address this issue, we examined here whether activin A can be detected in the kidney and/or urine from patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) -associated vasculitis (AAV). Fifty-one patients who had been diagnosed with AAV and were treated in our department between November 2011 to March 2018 were included in this study. Forty-one patients had renal complications (renal AAV). Serum and urinary activin A levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Correlation of urinary activin A concentration with clinical parameters was analyzed. Urinary activin A was undetectable in healthy volunteers. In contrast, urinary activin A concentration was significantly increased in patients with renal AAV but not in those with non-renal AAV. Urinary activin A concentration decreased rapidly after immunosuppressive treatment. There was a significant correlation of urinary activin A level with urinary protein, L-FABP, and NAG. Histologic evaluation revealed that urinary activin A levels were significantly higher in patients with cellular crescentic glomeruli than in those lacking this damage. In situ hybridization demonstrated that the mRNA encoding the activin A βA subunit was undetectable in normal kidneys but accumulated in the proximal tubules and crescentic glomeruli of the kidneys of patients with renal AAV. Immunostaining showed that activin A protein also was present in the proximal tubules, crescentic glomeruli, and macrophages infiltrating into the interstitium in the kidneys of patients with renal AAV. These data suggested that urinary activin A concentration reflects renal inflammation and tubular damage in AAV and may be a useful biomarker for monitoring renal AAV."
https://openalex.org/W2980730139,"The c-Met/hepatocyte growth factor receptor pathway is frequently dysregulated in multiple cancer types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MET amplification has been shown to develop as a resistance mechanism to treatment in NSCLC. The identification of increased MET copy number within tumour cells is increasingly important to stratify those tumours and patients which are susceptible to treatment targetting MET kinase inhibition. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) has been successfully employed to identify patients with abnormal MET gene copy number with numerous probes available for use. Here we report a FISH protocol that reduces probe hybridisation time in NSCLC tissue to 1 hour and compare the results with other protocols. MET gene copy number was determined in 20 NSCLC cases using 3 FISH probes: 1. Kreatech FISH, MET (7q31) SE 7 ready to use probes, hybridised using an overnight protocol; 2. Dako MET IQFISH probe with CEP7 ready to use probe, hybridised for 2 hours; 3. Kreatech MET (7q31) SE 7 XL FISH probe, prepared in SwiftFISH buffer and hybridised for 1 hour. The MET gene copy number and MET: centromere 7 gene ratio were determined for each tissue and cases categorised as having MET high or MET low status. All three FISH probes were shown to demonstrate good agreement with each other. Overall percentage agreement between probes was ≥90%. Intraclass correlation showed good agreement (ICC ≥0.80) between all three assays for MET gene copy number and MET: centromere 7 gene ratio. These FISH protocols provide evidence that rapid laboratory developed FISH assays with short turnaround time perform consistently with standard protocols, potentially enabling faster treatment decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2980567171,"Heart failure (HF) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome with varying prognosis. Subphenotyping of HF is a research priority to advance our understanding of the syndrome. We formulated a subphenotyping schema and compared long-term mortality risk among the HF subphenotypes in the community-based Framingham Study.In hierarchical order, we grouped participants with new-onset HF (stratified by HF with reduced [HFrEF] vs. preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]) according to the presence of: (1) coronary heart disease (CHD), (2) metabolic syndrome (MetS), (3) hypertension, and (4) 'other' causes. Age at HF onset was lowest in people with the MetS (mean 76 vs. 77 years for HFrEF and HFpEF, respectively) and highest in those with hypertension only (mean 82 and 85 years for HFrEF and HFpEF, respectively). For HFrEF, 10-year cumulative mortality and hazards ratios [HR] were 87% for CHD (n = 219; referent group), 88% for MetS (n = 105; HR 0.95 [95% CI 0.73-1.23]), 82% for hypertension (n = 104; HR 0.71 [0.55-0.91]), and 78% for other (n = 37; HR 0.81 [0.55-1.19]). Corresponding 10-year cumulative mortality and HR data for HFpEF were: 85% for CHD (n = 84; referent), 83% for MetS (n = 118; HR 0.98 [0.72-1.33]), 81% for hypertension (n = 127; HR 0.71 [0.52-0.95]), and 76% for other (n = 43; HR 0.76 [0.50-1.14]). In a sample without overt heart failure (n = 5536), several echocardiographic and vascular indices showed graded worsening of age- and sex adjusted-values among those having CHD, MetS, hypertension, or obesity, compared with individuals not having these risk factors.HF subphenotypes characterized by the presence of CHD or metabolic syndrome present at a younger age and are marked by greater mortality risk. The clinical utility of the proposed subphenotyping schema warrants further research."
https://openalex.org/W2980605651,"The soft palate is a key component of the oropharyngeal complex that is critical for swallowing, breathing, hearing and speech. However, complete functional restoration in patients with cleft soft palate remains a challenging task. New insights into the molecular signaling network governing the development of soft palate will help to overcome these clinical challenges. In this study, we investigated whether key signaling pathways required for hard palate development are also involved in soft palate development in mice. We described the dynamic expression patterns of signaling molecules from well-known pathways, such as Wnt, Hh, and Fgf, during the development of the soft palate. We found that Wnt signaling is active throughout the development of soft palate myogenic sites, predominantly in cells of cranial neural crest (CNC) origin neighboring the myogenic cells, suggesting that Wnt signaling may play a significant role in CNC-myogenic cell-cell communication during myogenic differentiation in the soft palate. Hh signaling is abundantly active in early palatal epithelium, some myogenic cells, and the CNC-derived cells adjacent to the myogenic cells. Hh signaling gradually diminishes during the later stages of soft palate development, indicating its involvement mainly in early embryonic soft palate development. Fgf signaling is expressed most prominently in CNC-derived cells in the myogenic sites and persists until later stages of embryonic soft palate development. Collectively, our results highlight a network of Wnt, Hh, and Fgf signaling that may be involved in the development of the soft palate, particularly soft palate myogenesis. These findings provide a foundation for future studies on the functional significance of these signaling pathways individually and collectively in regulating soft palate development."
https://openalex.org/W2980579129,"Background Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery (LCA) from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital heart disease. Retrograde flow from the right coronary artery (RCA) through natural collaterals to the low-pressure main pulmonary artery causes extensive ischemia. Limited data concerning the extent of permanent myocardial damage and functional recovery after surgical repair in the long-term follow-up is available. Aim Determination of the incidence of incipient myocardial dysfunction in ALCAPA patients in the long-term observation using tissue Doppler and speckle tracking echocardiography. Methods and results Eighteen ALCAPA patients after surgical repair (at median age of 7 months, range 3–167) underwent echocardiographic examination after (median) 17 years. All but 4 patients in NYHA class II presented well at follow-up. No narrowing in proximal LCA was detected in color Doppler. The initial (pre-surgical) left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of 33±17% almost normalized to 55±6%, but was lower than in the age, sex and body surface area matched control group: 62±5% (p<0.001). At follow-up, LV global longitudinal strain (LS): -15.8±3.3% vs -21.9±1.7%; right ventricular LS: -20.6±3.9% vs -24.9±4.6%; left atrial LS: 27.7±4.3% vs 41.0±11.5%; right atrial LS: 26.8±7.4% vs 44.0±7.9% and early pulsed wave to tissue Doppler mitral filling ratio (E/E’): 8.1±2.6 vs 5.8±1.3 were impaired in the ALCAPA population in comparison to the control group (p<0.01 for all comparisons). LV radial and circumferential strain did not differ between groups. Mean LS in the ALCAPA patients in the RCA region was -19.0±4.4%, while in the LCA region -13.8±7.3% (p<0.00001). Conclusions Despite good clinical condition and normalized LV ejection fraction in ALCAPA patients after surgical repair in the long-term follow-up, the diastolic and longitudinal systolic function of all cardiac chambers remained impaired, especially in the LCA region. Lifelong surveillance of repaired ALCAPA patients is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2980826262,"Marine management interventions are increasingly being implemented with the explicit goal of rebuilding ocean ecosystems, but early responses may begin with alterations in ecological interactions preceding detectable changes in population-level characteristics. To establish a baseline from which to monitor the effects of spatial protection on reef fish trophic ecology and track future ecosystem-level changes, we quantified temperate reef fish densities, size, biomass, diets and isotopic signatures at nine sites nested within two fished and one five-year old marine protected area (MPA) on the northwest coast of Canada. We calculated rockfish (Sebastes spp.) community and species-specific niche breadth for fished and protected areas based on δ13C and δ15N values. We found that rockfish community niche width was greater inside the MPA relative to adjacent fished reefs due to an expanded nitrogen range, possibly reflecting early changes in trophic interactions following five years of spatial protection. Our data also demonstrated that the MPA had a positive effect on the δ15N signature of rockfish (i.e., trophic position), but the effect of rockfish length on its own was not well-supported. In addition, we found a positive interaction between rockfish length and δ15N signature, such that δ15N signatures of rockfish caught within the MPA increased more rapidly with body size than those caught in fished areas. Differences in rockfish size structure and biomass among fished and unfished areas were not clearly evident. Species of rockfish and lingcod varied in trophic and size responses, indicating that life-history traits play an important role in predicting MPA effects. These results may suggest early changes in trophic behavior of slow-growing rockfish due to predation risk by faster growing higher trophic level predators such as lingcod inside MPAs established on temperate reefs. Consequently, spatial protection may restore both the trophic and behavioral roles of previously fished consumers earlier and in measurable ways sooner than observable changes in abundance and size."

We examined cross-cultural differences in cognitive biases, comparing Westerners’ and East Asians’ performance and acculturation following migration to the opposite culture. Two local (UK, Hong Kong) and four migrant (short-term and long-term migrants to each culture) samples completed culturally validated tasks measuring attentional and interpretation bias. Hong Kong residents were more positively biased than people living in the UK on several measures, consistent with the lower prevalence of psychological disorders in East Asia. Migrants to the UK had reduced positive biases on some tasks, while migrants to Hong Kong were more positive, compared to their respective home counterparts, consistent with acculturation in attention and interpretation biases. These data illustrate the importance of cultural validation of findings and, if replicated, would have implications for the mental health and well-being of migrants."
https://openalex.org/W2980616302,"To determine whether visual-tactile sensory substitution utilizing the Low-vision Enhancement Optoelectronic (LEO) Belt prototype is suitable as a new visual aid for those with reduced peripheral vision by assessing mobility performance and user opinions.Sighted subjects (n = 20) and subjects with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) (n = 6) were recruited. The LEO Belt was evaluated on two cohorts: normally sighted subjects wearing goggles to artificially reduce peripheral vision to simulate stages of RP progression, and subjects with advanced visual field limitation from RP. Mobility speed and accuracy was assessed using simple mazes, with and without the LEO Belt, to determine its usefulness across disease severities and lighting conditions.Sighted subjects wearing most narrowed field goggles simulating most advanced RP had increased mobility accuracy (44% mean reduction in errors, p = 0.014) and self-reported confidence (77% mean increase, p = 0.004) when using the LEO Belt. Additionally, use of LEO doubled mobility accuracy for RP subjects with remaining visual fields between 10° and 20°. Further, in dim lighting, confidence scores for this group also doubled. By patient reported outcomes, subjects largely deemed the device comfortable (100%), easy to use (92.3%) and thought it had potential future benefit as a visual aid (96.2%). However, regardless of severity of vision loss or simulated vision loss, all subjects were slower to complete the mazes using the device.The LEO Belt improves mobility accuracy and therefore confidence in those with severely restricted peripheral vision. The LEO Belt's positive user feedback suggests it has potential to become the next generation of visual aid for visually impaired individuals. Given the novelty of this approach, we expect navigation speeds may improve with experience."
https://openalex.org/W2980629199,"To further investigate the role of the phosphate (Pi) transporter PIT1 in Pi homeostasis and tissue mineralization, we developed a transgenic mouse expressing the C-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged human PIT1 transporter under control of the cytomegalovirus/chicken beta actin/rabbit beta-globin gene (CAG) promotor and a loxP-stop-loxP (LSL) cassette permitting conditional activation of transgene expression (LSL-HA-hPITtg/+). For an initial characterization of this conditional mouse model, germline excision of the LSL cassette was performed to induce expression of the transgene in all mouse tissues (HA-hPIT1tg/+). Recombination was confirmed using genomic DNA obtained from blood samples of these mice. Furthermore, expression of HA-hPIT1 was found to be at least 10-fold above endogenous mouse Pit1 in total RNA isolated from multiple tissues and from cultured primary calvaria osteoblasts (PCOB) estimated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Robust expression of the HA-hPIT1 protein was also observed upon immunoblot analysis in most tissues and permits HA-mediated immunoprecipitation of the transporter. Characterization of the phenotype of HA-hPIT1tg/+ mice at 80 days of age when fed a standard chow (0.7% Pi and 1% calcium) showed elevated plasma Pi, but normal plasma iPTH, iFGF23, serum calcium, BUN, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D levels and urine Pi, calcium and protein excretion when compared to WT littermates. Likewise, no change in bone mineral density was observed upon uCT analysis of the distal femur obtained from these mice. In conclusion, heterozygous overexpression of HA-hPIT1 is compatible with life and causes hyperphosphatemia while bone and mineral metabolism of these mice are otherwise normal."

Al dramatically inhibited the growth of C. grandis seedlings, as revealed by a decreased dry weight of roots and shoots. Elevating P level could ameliorate the Al-induced growth inhibition and organic acid (malate and citrate) secretion in C. grandis. Using a comparative proteomic approach revealed by the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) technique, 318 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were successfully identified and quantified in this study. The possible mechanisms underlying P-induced alleviation of Al toxicity in C. grandis were proposed. Furthermore, some DAPs, such as GLN phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase 2, ATP-dependent caseinolytic (Clp) protease/crotonase family protein, methionine-S-oxide reductase B2, ABC transporter I family member 17 and pyridoxal phosphate phosphatase, were reported for the first time to respond to Al stress in Citrus plants.

https://openalex.org/W2981072127,"Cyclocarya paliurus is a unique tree species of that grows in southern China. The tree contains distinctive saponins in the leaf that has hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects. It was aimed to detect localization of saponins and suitable time of harvest for medicinal uses. Histochemical, cytochemical localization and UV-spectrophotometry were carried out in C. paliurus plant. We found that in all organs, the saponins were primarily located in the parenchyma cells and the highest saponins accumulation was in the palisade tissue in leaves. Cytochemical localization results indicated that saponins were mainly distributed in the chloroplast, vesicle, and plasmalemma. On average, the total saponins content in leaves (20.57 mg·g-1) was two and three times greater than in root (10.19 mg·g-1) and shoot (6.20 mg·g-1), respectively. Moreover, the saponins content in the leaf and root exhibited fluctuations, which were highest in September. Considering saponins levels and biomass, we conclude that harvesting all leaves in September is an economical and effective strategy for medicinal use in C. paliurus."

https://openalex.org/W2980423596,"Background High quality diagnostic services are crucial for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, treatment and control. A strong laboratory quality management system (QMS) is critical to ensuring the quality of testing and results. Recent initiatives to improve TB laboratory quality have focused on low and middle-income countries, but similar issues also apply to high-income countries. Methods and findings Using a multipronged approach reviews of facilities, equipment, processes (purchasing, pre-analytic, analytic and post-analytic), staff, health and safety, documentation, information management and organization based on the ISO 15189 and the twelve quality system essentials were conducted between October 2015 and January 2016 at the National TB Reference Laboratory in Germany. Outcome assessment included proportion of smear positive slides, proportion of contaminated liquid cultures and DNA contamination rates before and after implementation of QMS. The odds ratio for these outcomes was calculated using a before/after comparison. Reviews highlighted deficiencies across all twelve quality system essentials and were addressed in order of priority and urgency. Actions aimed at improving analytical quality, health and safety and information management were prioritised for initial implementation in parallel with each other. The odds ratio for a sample to be tested as microscopically positive increased by 2.08 (95%CI 1.41–3.06) comparing the time before with the time after implementation of quality managed fluorescence microscopy. Liquid culture contamination rates decreased from 23.6- 7.6% in April-July 2016 to <10% in November 2017-March 2018. The proportion of negative controls showing evidence of DNA contamination decreased from 38.2% in 2013 to 8.1% in 2017, the corresponding odds ratio was 0.14 (95%CI 0.07–0.29). Conclusion This study showed marked improvement on quality indicators after implementation of a QMS in a National TB Reference Laboratory. The challenges and lessons learned in this study are valuable not just for high-income settings, but are equally generalizable to other laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W2980543561,"Our decisions are often swayed by a desire to avoid losses over a desire to acquire gains. While loss aversion has been confirmed for decisions about money or commodities, it is unclear how individuals generally value gains relative to losses in effort-based decisions. For example, do individuals avoid greater work more than they seek out less work? We examined this question in the context of physical effort, using an arm-reaching task in which decreased effort was framed as a gain and increased effort was framed as a loss. Subjects performed reaching movements against different levels of resistance that increased or decreased the effort demands of the reaches. They then chose to accept or reject various lotteries, each with a possibility of performing less effortful reaches and a possibility of performing more effortful reaches, compared to the certain outcome of performing reaches against a fixed reference level of effort. Subjects avoided higher effort conditions more than they sought lower effort conditions, demonstrating asymmetric valuation of gains and losses. Using prospect theory, we explored various model formulations to determine subject-specific valuation of effort in these mixed gambles. A nonlinear model of effort valuation demonstrating increasing sensitivity to absolute effort best described the effort lottery choices. In contrast to the loss-aversion observed in financial decisions, there was no evidence of loss aversion in effort-based decisions. Rather, we observed moderate relief-seeking behavior. This model confirms that gains and losses are valued asymmetrically. This is due to the combined effects of increasing sensitivity to absolute effort and moderate relief-seeking, leading to a net effect of greater avoidance of higher effort. Asymmetric valuation was magnified on a later day of testing. In contrast, subjects were loss-averse in a comparable financial task. We suggest that consideration of nonlinear effort valuation can inform future studies of sensorimotor control and exercise motivation."

Facial expression recognition is used for many applications, such as security, human-computer interaction, driver safety, and health care. Although many works aim to tackle the problem of facial expression recognition, and the discriminative power may be acceptable, current solutions have limited explicative power, which is insufficient for certain applications, such as facial rehabilitation. Our aim is to alleviate the current limited explicative power by exploiting explainable fuzzy models over sequences of frontal face images. The proposed model uses appearance features to describe facial expressions in terms of facial movements, giving a detailed explanation of what movements are in the face, and why the model is making a decision. The model architecture was selected to keep the semantic meaning of the found facial movements. The proposed model can discriminate between the seven basic facial expressions, obtaining an average accuracy of 90.8±14%, with a maximum value of 92.9±28%."
https://openalex.org/W2980399078,"Many grasslands have disappeared over the last century as a result of anthropogenic land use intensification, while new patches are emerging through abandonment of arable fields. Here, we compared species (SD), functional (FD) and phylogenetic (PD) (alpha) diversity among 272 dry grassland patches of two age-classes: old and new, with the new patches being dry grasslands established on previous intensively managed fields during the last 30 years. We first compared SD, FD and PD, between patches of different age. Then, we performed generalized linear models to determine the influence of abiotic, present-day and historical landscape configuration variables on SD, FD and PD. By measuring abiotic variables, we explained the effect of environmental filtering on species diversity, whereas the present-day and historical landscape configuration variables were included to describe how the spatial and temporal configuration of the patches influence patterns of species. Finally, we applied partial regressions to explore the relative importance of abiotic, present-day and historical variables in explaining the diversity metrics and how this varies between patches of different ages. We found higher SD in the old compared to the new patches, but no changes in FD and PD. SD was mostly affected by abiotic and present-day landscape configuration variables in the new and the old patches, respectively. In the new patches, historical variables explained variation in the FD, while present-day variables explained the PD. In the old patches, historical variables accounted for most of the variation in both FD and PD. Our evidence suggests that the relative importance of assembly processes has changed over time, showing that environmental filtering and changes in the landscape configuration prevented the establishment of species in the new patches. However, the loss of species (i.e. SD) is not necessarily linked to a loss of functions and evolutionary potential."
https://openalex.org/W2980466438,"This paper presents an alternative calculation procedure to calculate the mortality rate, exploiting the data available in the Eurostat demography database for Spain. This methodology has been devised based on two of the most widely known and widespread models to establish the mortality rate: The Gompertz-Makeham (GM) and Lee-Carter (LC) models. Our main goal is to obtain a model yielding a similar accuracy than LC or GM, but able to capture the variation of their parameters over time and ages. The method proposed herewith works by applying simple or double fitting, with non-linear functions, to the values of the parameters considered by each one of such models. One of the main advantages of our approach is that we considerably reduce the amount of data that is required to establish the mortality rate, with respect to what would be needed if the traditional models were used. On the other hand, it also allows analyzing the evolution of the mortality rate, even if no real data was available for a particular year. The results evince that, besides fulfilling the two aforementioned goals, the proposed scheme yields an estimation error that is comparable with that offered by the traditional approach."

The current study aims to evaluate various pedotransfer functions for predicting soil pH using different geochemical indices (CaO, ratios of Al2O3, Fe2O3, TiO2, SiO2, MgO, and K2O to CaO) in forest soils. Various models including empirical functions (quadratic, cubic, sigmoid, logarithmic) and artificial neural network with these geochemical indices were assessed by independent testing set. Mean bias error (MBE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2), t-statistics (t-stat), and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) were applied to evaluate the model performances. Additionally, a new indicator (global performance indictor, GPI) was originally introduced in this study and was used to rank these models. According to GPI, the sigmoid functions and ANNs performed better than others. On average, they could explain above 70% of the variability in soil pH. Both model structure and dataset shape impact on model performance. The best input was CaO for ANNs, sigmoid, and logarithmic functions. The ratios of K2O to CaO and Al2O3 to CaO were the best inputs for quadratic and cubic equations, respectively."

However, the mechanism underlying this increase is unclear. Here, we focused on the mechanism of poly(I:C)-induced expression of stem cell-specific genes in human somatic cells. Addition of poly(I:C) to human fibroblast culture medium did not increase OCT3/4 mRNA expression, but poly(I:C) transfection markedly increased OCT3/4 expression and induced nuclear localization of the OCT3/4 protein, implying that not TLR3, but RIG-I and MDA5 are required for OCT3/4 expression. Moreover, although cytoplasmic dsRNA increased OCT3/4 mRNA, cytoplasmic dsDNAs, such as salmon sperm DNA and poly(dA:dT), did not. Interestingly, the expression of NANOG, SOX2, Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), and proto-oncogene c-Myc was also increased by cytoplasmic dsRNA. Of note, siRNAs that silenced MAVS and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) expression reduced OCT3/4 levels after stimulation with poly(I:C); however, an NF-κB inhibitor and siRNA-mediated knockdown of proto-oncogene c-Jun did not significantly reduce the mRNA levels. We conclude that cytoplasmic dsRNA increases the expression of stem cell-specific genes in human somatic cells in a MAVS- and IRF1-dependent manner. Cytoplasmic dsRNA is recognized by RNA helicase RIG-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), triggering induction of the innate immune response via the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). In contrast, extracellular dsRNA is internalized into endosomes and recognized by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), which triggers signaling via the Toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM-1).

We conclude that cytoplasmic dsRNA increases the expression of stem cell-specific genes in human somatic cells in a MAVS- and IRF1-dependent manner. The innate immune system is essential for protection against viruses and bacteria at early phases of infections (1Kawai T. Akira S. Toll-like receptors and their crosstalk with other innate receptors in infection and immunity.Immunity. 2011; 34 (21616434): 637-65010.1016/j.immuni.2011.05.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar).

Yamada T. Regulation of signaling mediated by nucleic acid sensors for innate interferon-mediated responses during viral infection.Int.

In the case of viral infection, viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the endosomes is recognized by TLR3, whereas cytoplasmic dsRNA is recognized by RIG-I and MDA5 (3Matsumoto M. Seya T. TLR3: interferon induction by double-stranded RNA including poly(I:C).Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2008; 60 (18262679): 805-81210.1016/j.addr.2007.11.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). TLR3 utilizes the TICAM-1 adaptor to trigger the downstream signaling, and RIG-I and MDA5 activate the signaling via the MAVS adaptor (4Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. The RNA helicase RIG-I has an essential function in double-stranded RNA-induced innate antiviral responses.Nat.

TLR9 senses nonmethylated CpG DNA and induces pro-inflammatory cytokine expression via the MyD88 adaptor (5Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K. Akira S. A Toll-like receptor recognizes bacterial DNA.Nature. 2000; 408 (11130078): 740-74510.1038/35047123Crossref PubMed Scopus (5360) Google Scholar). In contrast, cytoplasmic dsDNA is recognized by cGAS, which produces a second messenger cGAMP that activates the STING adaptor and induces cytokine expression (6Li X.D. Wu J. Gao D. Wang H. Sun L. Chen Z.J. Pivotal roles of cGAS-cGAMP signaling in antiviral defense and immune adjuvant effects.Science. 2013; 341 (23989956): 1390-139410.1126/science.1244040Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 7Sun L.

In addition, cytoplasmic viral nucleic acid sensors can recognize bacterial infection (8Zevini A. Olagnier D. Hiscott J. Crosstalk between cytoplasmic RIG-I and STING sensing pathways.Trends Immunol. 2017; 38 (28073693): 194-20510.1016/j.it.2016.12.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It is notable that PRRs can recognize damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which are released from host cells via necrosis caused by cell stress and damage (9Newton K. Dixit V.M.

Biol. 2012; 4 (22296764): a006049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). pattern recognition receptor Toll-like receptor RIG-I–like receptor Toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 1 mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein interferon damage-associated molecular pattern induced pluripotent stem cells stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency quantitative PCR glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane hepatitis C virus. There are several reports showing that bacterial infection promotes the reprogramming of human somatic cells. Ohta and colleagues reported that lactic acid bacteria could induce the expression of a subset of pluripotent stem cell marker genes, such as NANOG, OCT3/4, and SOX2 in human somatic cells (10Ito N. Ohta K. Reprogramming of human somatic cells by bacteria.Dev. Growth Differ. 2015; 57 (25866152): 305-31210.1111/dgd.12209Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, Mycobacterium leprae infection also induces the expression of stem cell markers, CD73, CD44, Sca-1, and CD29, in Schwann cells (10Ito N. Ohta K. Reprogramming of human somatic cells by bacteria.Dev. Growth Differ. 2015; 57 (25866152): 305-31210.1111/dgd.12209Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similar to a bacterial infection, cell damage or stress also induces the expression of stem cell-specific genes. For instance, pluripotent multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cells are stem cells that could be isolated by treating cells with various types of stresses, such as long-term collagenase treatment, serum deprivation, low temperatures, and hypoxia (11Bhartiya D. Pluripotent stem cells in adult tissues: struggling to be acknowledged over two decades.Stem Cell Rev. 2017; 13: 713-72410.1007/s12015-017-9756-yCrossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Severe cell stress leads to necrosis or necroptosis, resulting in the release of DAMPs, which can be recognized by PRRs. The relationship of the activation of PRRs and efficient reprogramming of cells has been previously implied. Lee et al. (12Lee J. Sayed N. Hunter A. Au K.F. Wong W.H. Mocarski E.S. Pera R.R. Yakubov E. Cooke J.P. Activation of innate immunity is required for efficient nuclear reprogramming.Cell. 2012; 151 (23101625): 547-55810.1016/j.cell.2012.09.034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) reported that poly(I:C) promotes the expression of Oct4, Sox2, and NANOG, and that is required for efficient nuclear reprogramming in the induction of pluripotency. The role of RLRs on the expression of Oct3/4 was also reported (13Sayed N. Ospino F. Himmati F. Lee J. Chanda P. Mocarski E.S. Cooke J.P. Retinoic acid inducible gene 1 protein (RIG1)-like receptor pathway is required for efficient nuclear reprogramming.Stem Cells. 2017; 35 (28276156): 1197-120710.1002/stem.2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, their underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of poly(I:C)-induced expression of the stem cell-specific genes. Our data indicate that cytoplasmic poly(I:C) as well as dsRNA activate the MAVS adaptor of RLRs and induces the expression of stem cell-specific genes via the transcription factor IRF1. To investigate the effect of poly(I:C) on the expression of stem cell-specific genes, human fibroblast BJ cells, which are frequently used to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) (14Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors.Cell. 2007; 131 (18035408): 861-87210.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14964) Google Scholar), were stimulated with poly(I:C) by several methods as follows. Addition of poly(I:C) to cell culture medium is known to induce type I IFN expression via the TLR3-mediated signaling pathway (15Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Recognition of double-stranded RNA and activation of NF-κB by Toll-like receptor 3.Nature. 2001; 413 (11607032): 732-73810.1038/35099560Crossref PubMed Scopus (4908) Google Scholar). When poly(I:C) was added to the cell culture medium, IFN-β mRNA expression was increased upon stimulation (Fig. 1A); however, the Oct3/4 mRNA levels were not increased (Fig. 1B). DOTAP is a transfection reagent and is known to enforce endosomal translocation of nucleic acids (16Almofti M.R. Harashima H. Shinohara Y. Almofti A. Baba Y. Kiwada H. Cationic liposome-mediated gene delivery: biophysical study and mechanism of internalization.Arch. Biochem.

Poly(I:C) transfected using DOTAP were delivered to the endosomes, thus stimulating TLR3, and leading to type I IFN expression (3Matsumoto M. Seya T. TLR3: interferon induction by double-stranded RNA including poly(I:C).Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2008; 60 (18262679): 805-81210.1016/j.addr.2007.11.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 18Itoh K. Watanabe A. Funami K. Seya T. Matsumoto M.

Similar to the addition of poly(I:C) to the cell culture medium, poly(I:C) transfection using DOTAP induced IFN-β mRNA expression (Fig. 1A) but did not increase the Oct3/4 mRNA levels (Fig. 1B). Next, we tested the stimulation of BJ cells by transfecting with poly(I:C) using Lipofectamine 2000, which results in the activation of cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors, RIG-I and MDA5 (19Loo Y.M. Gale Jr., M. Immune signaling by RIG-I-like receptors.Immunity. 2011; 34 (21616437): 680-69210.1016/j.immuni.2011.05.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Oct3/4 mRNA levels were markedly increased by transfection with poly(I:C) using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Fig. 1B). TBK1 and IRF-3 phosphorylation are required for type I IFN expression after poly(I:C) stimulation, and phosphorylation of the proteins was detected in BJ cells upon transfection with poly(I:C) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent, and knockdown of MAVS suppressed phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). To confirm the protein expression of the Oct3/4 upon stimulation, we performed confocal microscopy. Although the Oct3/4 protein was not detected in unstimulated BJ cells, nuclear localization of the protein was detected 24 h after poly(I:C) transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 as observed in cells infected with Sendai virus vector carrying Oct3/4 (SeV with Oct3/4) (Fig. 1D). LX-2 is a human hepatic stellate cell line, and transfection with poly(I:C) using Lipofectamine 2000 also increased Oct3/4 mRNA expression; moreover, the nuclear localization of Oct3/4 was detected in stimulated LX-2 cells (Fig. 1, E and F), suggesting that poly(I:C)-mediated Oct3/4 expression is not specific to BJ cells. We next investigated the effect of other PAMPs on Oct3/4 expression. Salmon sperm DNA and synthesized oligo poly(dA:dT) were transfected into BJ cells, and the expression levels of type I IFN and Oct3/4 were determined. Unlike poly(I:C), transfection with salmon sperm DNA and oligo(dA:dT) using Lipofectamine 2000 failed to increase Oct3/4 mRNA levels; however, it successfully induced IFN-β mRNA expression (Fig. 1, G and H). These data suggest that cGAS and/or TLR9 are not required for the Oct3/4 expression. Cytoplasmic poly(I:C) is recognized by cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors, RIG-I and MDA5. Both RIG-I and MDA5 require the MAVS adaptor molecule to induce downstream signaling. Therefore, we next investigated the effect of MAVS knockdown on Oct3/4 expression upon stimulation. siRNA for MAVS reduced MAVS mRNA levels in BJ cells (Fig. 2A). We confirmed that siRNA for MAVS significantly reduced IFN-β mRNA levels in cells transfected with poly(I:C) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Fig. 2B). siRNA for MAVS significantly reduced Oct3/4 mRNA levels (Fig. 2C). NANOG is a stem cell-specific gene, and its expression was also increased by transfection with poly(I:C) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Fig. 2D). Similar to Oct3/4 expression, NANOG expression was reduced by siRNA for MAVS (Fig. 2D). siRNA for MAVS hardly reduced IFN-β mRNA expression upon poly(I:C) stimulation using DOTAP (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that cytoplasmic poly(I:C) increases Oct3/4 and NANOG expression in a MAVS-dependent manner. Takahashi and Yamanaka (20Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126 (16904174): 663-67610.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18864) Google Scholar) selected 24 genes as candidates for factors that induce pluripotency in somatic cells, and Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 were revealed to be crucial for inducing pluripotent stem cells. Later studies showed that the other candidate genes also contribute to the efficient generation of pluripotent stem cells (21Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. A decade of transcription factor-mediated reprogramming to pluripotency.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17 (26883003): 183-19310.1038/nrm.2016.8Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Because poly(I:C) transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 induced the expression of Oct3/4 and NANOG as described above, we next measured the expression levels of the 24 genes upon stimulation. In addition to Oct3/4 and NANOG, the expression levels of SOX2, KLF4, c-Myc, REX1, SALL, DPPA2, DPPA3, ECAT1, DPPA4, and SOX15 were markedly increased by poly(I:C) transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 (Fig. 3). We could not detect the expression of DNMT3L, DPPA5, ERAS, FTHL17, GDF3, TCL1A, and UTF1 in BJ cells even in the presence or absence of poly(I:C) transfection (Fig. 3). Stimulation with poly(I:C) exhibited a marginal effect on the expression of β-catenine, ECAT8, FBOX15, GRB2, and STAT3 (Fig. 3). These data suggest that cytoplasmic poly(I:C) enhanced the expression of genes that contribute to the efficient generation of pluripotent stem cells. Poly(I:C) is a synthetic analog of viral dsRNA, and the 3′ UTR of HCV RNA is well-known to be recognized by RIG-I (22Saito T. Owen D.M. Jiang F. Marcotrigiano J. Gale Jr., M. Innate immunity induced by composition-dependent RIG-I recognition of hepatitis C virus RNA.Nature. 2008; 454 (18548002): 523-52710.1038/nature07106Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Therefore, we prepared two types of HCV RNAs. First, 3′ UTR dsRNA was synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase and used for stimulation. Second, we prepared total RNA samples of O cells that contained HCV replicons, which are HCV genomic RNA replicating in host cells (23Oshiumi H. Ikeda M. Matsumoto M. Watanabe A. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Kato N. Shimotohno K. Seya T. Hepatitis C virus core protein abrogates the DDX3 function that enhances IPS-1-mediated IFN-β induction.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5 (21170385): e1425810.1371/journal.pone.0014258Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Total RNA of Oc cells, in which HCV replicons were removed by type I IFN treatment, was used for a negative control (24Ikeda M. Abe K. Dansako H. Nakamura T. Naka K. Kato N. Efficient replication of a full-length hepatitis C virus genome, strain O, in cell culture, and development of a luciferase reporter system.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329 (15766575): 1350-135910.1016/j.bbrc.2005.02.138Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We confirmed that in vitro synthesized 3′ UTR of HCV RNA increased IFN-β mRNA levels (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the expression levels of Oct3/4 as well as SOX2, KLF4, and c-Myc were increased by transfection with 3′ UTR HCV RNA using Lipofectamine 2000, as cytoplasmic poly(I:C) did (Fig. 4, B–E). In contrast, transfection with 3′ UTR HCV RNA using DOTAP failed to increase Oct3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-Myc, but successfully increased IFN-β mRNA expression levels (Fig. 4, F–J). Nuclear localization of the Oct3/4 protein was detected by transfection with 3′ UTR HCV RNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Fig. 4K). These data indicate that not only poly(I:C), but also in vitro synthesized HCV RNA can induce Oct3/4 expression in human BJ cells. In contrast to in vitro synthesized HCV RNA, transfection with total RNA extracted from O cells using Lipofectamine 2000 did not increase the expression of Oct3/4, although O cell total RNA increased the expression of IFN-β mRNA (Fig. 4A). Because O cells contain HCV replicons, these data imply that the amount of HCV RNA in O cells is not sufficient to induce the Oct3/4 expression. When we compared the expression of Oct3/4 mRNA levels in O cells with those of Oc cells, we could not detect any significant difference (Fig. 4L). These data suggest that some specific conditions, such as large amounts of cytoplasmic dsRNA, are required for RIG-I and MDA5 to induce Oct3/4 mRNA expression (see “Discussion”). To reveal the underlying mechanism, we investigated the role of the factors of the innate immunity in cytoplasmic dsRNA-mediated Oct3/4 expression. Because cytoplasmic poly(I:C) leads to the production of type I IFN, it is possible that type I IFN induces Oct3/4 expression after poly(I:C) stimulation. To test this hypothesis, siRNA for STAT1 was used to inhibit type I IFN receptor signaling. siRNA for STAT1 substantially reduced STAT1 mRNA expression (Fig. 5A). Contrary to what we expected, siRNA for STAT1 hardly reduced poly(I:C)-mediated Oct3/4 mRNA expression (Fig. 5A), suggesting that type I IFN signaling does not play a major role in the Oct3/4 expression. siRNA for STAT1 moderately reduced IFN-β mRNA expression upon poly(I:C) stimulation (Fig. 5A). Considering that RIG-I is an interferon-inducible gene, it is possible that basal expression of type I IFN affected RIG-I expression, thereby STAT1 knockdown reduced RIG-I–mediated type I IFN expression. To further test whether type I IFN signaling is responsible for Oct3/4 mRNA expression, we next used siRNA for STAT2, anti-IFNAR2 neutralization antibodies, and a JAK inhibitor. siRNA for STAT2 exhibited only a marginal effect on the Oct3/4 expression (Fig. 5B). Anti-IFNAR antibodies reduced the expression of an IFN-inducible gene IFIT-1; however, it failed to reduce Oct3/4 mRNA expression (Fig. 5C). In addition, stimulation with IFN-α itself could not increase Oct3/4 mRNA expression (Fig. 5C). Moreover, a JAK inhibitor failed to reduce the expression of Oct3/4 and NANOG mRNAs (Fig. 5, D and E). These data also suggest that type I IFN does not play a major role in poly(I:C)-mediated Oct3/4 mRNA expression. Considering that Oct3/4 expression in BJ cells requires MAVS, we reasoned that transcription factors that are downstream of MAVS would be responsible for Oct3/4 expression. The transcription factors IRF1, IRF3, AP-1, and NF-κB are reported to be activated by MAVS-dependent signaling. We identified the binding motifs of IRF1, AP-1, and NF-κB on the promoter region of Oct3/4, SOX2, KLF4, c-Myc, and NANOG (Fig. 6A). To test the role of NF-κB in Oct3/4 expression, we used BAY11-7082, an inhibitor for NF-κB. Although the inhibitor markedly reduced IFN-β and TNFα expression upon stimulation with the 3′ UTR of HCV RNA and poly(I:C), it exhibited a marginal effect on Oct3/4 expression (Fig. 6B). Next, we tested the roles of IRF1 and c-Jun by using siRNAs, which substantially reduced their mRNA levels (Fig. 6C). Knockdown of c-Jun hardly reduced the expression of IFN-β, Oct3/4, and NANOG upon poly(I:C) stimulation (Fig. 6D). In contrast, knockdown of IRF1 reduced the mRNA levels of Oct3/4 and NANOG after poly(I:C) stimulation (Fig. 6D), suggesting that IRF1 is involved in Oct3/4 expression upon RLR stimulation. In contrast to Oct3/4 and NANOG, siRNA for IRF1 reduced KLF4 mRNA expression only at later time points (24 h post-stimulation) and failed to reduce the mRNA expression of SOX2 and c-Myc (Fig. 7A). These data imply that not only IRF1 but also other transcription factors might be required for the expression. To further investigate the role of IRF1, subcellular localization of IRF1 was observed before and after stimulation, because IRF1 is known to translocate to the nuclei after its activation. IRF1 nuclear localization was observed after stimulation with poly(I:C) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Fig. 7B). These data suggests that IRF1 was up-regulated and translocated into the nuclei after RLR stimulation. TLR3 activation also induced IRF1 nuclear localization (Fig. S1), implying that other transcription factors as well as IRF1 are involved in Oct3/4 expression. To further investigate the involvement of IRF1 in Oct3/4 expression, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay with anti-IRF1 antibody. Poly(I:C) stimulation using Lipofectamine 2000 increased the amount of precipitated Oct3/4 promoter region with anti-IRF1 antibody (Fig. 7C). Taken together, our data indicate that RIG-I and MDA5-induced IRF1 activation is involved in the expression of Oct3/4 mRNA. The role of PRRs in the reprogramming of somatic cells has been reported; however, the underlying mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effect of extracellular and cytoplasmic poly(I:C) and dsDNA, and found that cytoplasmic poly(I:C) increased Oct3/4 expression and induced its nuclear localization in human somatic cells more efficiently than extracellular/cytoplasmic dsDNA or extracellular poly(I:C). Interestingly, cytoplasmic poly(I:C)-induced Oct3/4 expression requires MAVS and IRF1 transcription factors. These observations indicate that the cytoplasmic poly(I:C), which is recognized by RIG-I and MDA5, activate the MAVS protein, leading to Oct3/4 expression via the activation of IRF-1 transcription factor. IRF1 was critical for the Oct3/4 expression. However, since IRF1 activation was also detected after TLR3 expression, we do not exclude the possibility that not only IRF1 but also other transcription factors are involved in Oct3/4 expression. MAVS is a solo adaptor of RIG-I and MDA, and it localizes on the mitochondria and peroxisome (25Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J. Identification and characterization of MAVS, a mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein that activates NF-κB and IRF 3.Cell. 2005; 122 (16125763): 669-68210.1016/j.cell.2005.08.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar, 26Dixit E.

In the innate immune response, mitochondrial MAVS activates IRF3 and NF-κB, which results in the expression of type I IFNs and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, peroxisomal MAVS activates IRF1 and induces the interferon-stimulated genes (26Dixit E. Boulant S. Zhang Y. Lee A.S. Odendall C. Shum B. Hacohen N. Chen Z.J. Whelan S.P. Fransen M. Nibert M.L. Superti-Furga G. Kagan J.C. Peroxisomes are signaling platforms for antiviral innate immunity.Cell. 2010; 141 (20451243): 668-68110.1016/j.cell.2010.04.018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Considering that IRF1 is required for poly(I:C)-mediated Oct3/4 expression, we hypothesize that the activation of peroxisomal MAVS is required for the Oct3/4 expression. Previous studies reported that poly(I:C)-mediated expression of Oct3/4 is required for TLR3 and its adaptor TICAM-1 (12Lee J. Sayed N. Hunter A. Au K.F. Wong W.H. Mocarski E.S. Pera R.R. Yakubov E. Cooke J.P. Activation of innate immunity is required for efficient nuclear reprogramming.Cell. 2012; 151 (23101625): 547-55810.1016/j.cell.2012.09.034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Based from our results, poly(I:C)-mediated Oct3/4 expression was largely dependent on the MAVS adaptor but not TICAM-1. However, these observations do not exclude the possibility that the TLR3 and TICAM-1 pathways induce the expression of the stem cell-specific genes in other types of somatic cells or in other experimental conditions. Several innate immune responses might be involved in the efficient reprogramming in the induction of pluripotency. There are several reports on how severe cell stress triggers the expression of stem cell-specific genes. Isolation of Muse cells requires several severe cell stresses, and cells referred to as stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP) cells require acidic conditions (11Bhartiya D. Pluripotent stem cells in adult tissues: struggling to be acknowledged over two decades.Stem Cell Rev. 2017; 13: 713-72410.1007/s12015-017-9756-yCrossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Niwa H.

Rep. 2016; 6 (27292224): 2800310.1038/srep28003Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Severe cell stress would induce necrosis and necroptosis, leading to the release of DAMPs, such as RNA and DNA. Recent studies reported that host RNA functions as a ligand for RIG-I and MDA5 (28Zhao Y. Ye X. Dunker W. Song Y. Karijolich J. RIG-I like receptor sensing of host RNAs facilitates the cell-intrinsic immune response to KSHV infection.Nat.

Therefore, it is possible that severe cell stresses lead to the release of host RNA, which results in its internalization into the cytoplasm, thereby activating the MAVS-IRF1 signaling pathway and leading to Oct3/4 mRNA expression. However, further studies are still required to reveal the underlying mechanism. In our experimental conditions, cytoplasmic poly(I:C) and in vitro synthesized viral RNA induced Oct3/4 mRNA expression, but Oct3/4 mRNA did not increase by stimulation with a physiological amount of viral RNA. These observations imply that mere viral infection hardly increases Oct3/4 expression. Considering that extracellular RNAs are easily internalized into the cytoplasm of myeloid cells, leading to activation of RIG-I and MDA5 (31Kato H. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Yoneyama M. Yamamoto M. Matsui K. Uematsu S. Jung A. Kawai T. Ishii K.J. Yamaguchi O. Otsu K. Tsujimura T. Koh C.S.

Niwa (27Niwa H. Investigation of the cellular reprogramming phenomenon referred to as stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP).Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 (27292224): 2800310.1038/srep28003Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) showed that the acidic conditions markedly increased Oct3/4 expression in a small population of cells; however, he could not reproduce the STAP phenomenon. We also could not detect any STAP phenomenon by using poly(I:C), but we detected a substantial increase in the expression of stem cell-specific genes. Thus, unlike the induction of four Yamanaka factors, the activation of the innate immune system would be insufficient for inducing pluripotency. Although the physiological significance of cytoplasmic dsRNA-induced expression of stem cell-specific genes is still unclear, we expect that chemicals targeting of the molecules involved in the MAVS-IRF1 pathway, such as RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, IRF1, Riplet, and ZNF598 (32Wang G.

https://openalex.org/W2980794541,"Although the interregional disparity in chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence has been reported globally, little is known about differences in CKD prevalence within a region. We aimed to study the intraregional distribution of renal function in the Northern Netherlands and identify determinants of geographical differences in renal function.We included 143,735 participants from the Lifelines population-based cohort in the Northern Netherlands. Spatial analysis was performed to identify regional clusters of lower eGFR (cold spots) and higher eGFR (hot spots) at the postal code level, without and with adjustment for clinical risk factors. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the contribution of neighborhood-level health-related behaviors, socioeconomic status, and environmental factors (air pollution parameters, urbanity) to regional clustering of lower eGFR.Significant spatial clustering of renal function was found for eGFR as well as for early stage renal function impairment (eGFR<90 ml/min/1.73 m2), (p<0.001). Spatial clustering persisted after adjustment of eGFR for clinical risk factors. In adjusted cold spots, the aggregate eGFR was lower (mean ± SD: 96.5±4.8 vs. 98.5±4.0 ml/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.001), and the prevalence of early stage renal function impairment (35.8±10.9 vs. 28.7±9.8%, p<0.001) and CKD stages 3-5 was higher (median (interquartile range): 1.2(0.1-2.4) vs 0(0-1.4)%, p<0.001) than in hot spots. In multivariable logistic regression, exposure to NO2 (Odd ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.19 to 1.75, p<0.001) was associated with cold spots (lower renal function), whereas proportion of fat intake in the diet (OR, 0.68; 95%CI, 0.48-0.97, P = 0.031) and income (OR, 0.91; 95%CI, 0.86-0.96, p<0.001) for median level income) were inversely related.Significant intraregional clustering of renal function, early renal function impairment and CKD were observed in the Northern Netherlands even after adjustment for renal function-related clinical risk factors. Environmental (air pollution), neighborhood-level socioeconomic factors and diet are determinants of intraregional renal function distribution. Spatial analysis might be a useful adjunct to guide public health strategies for the prevention of CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2981019898,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy can have serious health consequences for mothers and the unborn child. Nevertheless, IPV is seldom addressed in the context of parent preparation.This study aimed to map the prevalence, direction, and severity of IPV in a sample of expectant couples signing up for universally-offered parent preparation.A total of 1726 Danish couples expecting their first child provided data on physical and psychological IPV by completing the Family Maltreatment measure during the second trimester of pregnancy.In 18.5% of the couples, at least one partner reported psychological or physical IPV acts during the past year. In more than 8% of couples, one or both partners reported acts and impacts above the ICD-11 threshold for clinically-significant IPV (CS-IPV) during the past year (3.6% physical CS-IPV, 5.3% psychological CS-IPV, and 0.8% both physical and psychological CS-IPV). Among couples with physical IPV below the clinical threshold, pregnant-woman-to-partner (50%) and bidirectional (38.2%) IPV were more common than partner-to-pregnant-woman IPV (11.8%). Among couples with physical CS-IPV, pregnant-woman-to-partner (36.1%), partner-to-pregnant-women (29.1%) and bidirectional (34.4%) forms were equally common. Among couples with psychological IPV, pregnant-woman-to-partner (54.9%) and partner-to-pregnant-woman (39.6%) IPV were more common than bidirectional IPV (5.5%).The prevalence of violence was markedly higher in this study compared with previous reports from the Nordic region and highlights a previous oversight of a substantial and clinically significant level of pregnant-woman-to-partner IPV-as well as the reverse. Data from this study call for IPV to be addressed in universally offered parent preparation programs."
https://openalex.org/W2981208905,"Patients with primary or secondary antibody deficiency (PAD or SAD) are at increased risk of recurrent infections that can be alleviated by immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IRT). In addition to replenishing antibody levels, IRT has been suggested to modulate immune response in patients with antibody deficiency. Although both commonly treated with IRT, the underlying causes of PAD and SAD vary greatly, suggesting differential modulation of T-cell function that may lead to different responses to IRT. To explore this, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were sampled from 17 PAD and 14 SAD patients before and 2–10 months after initiation of IRT, and analyzed for changes in T-cell phenotype and function. Proportions of CD4, CD8, Treg, or memory T-cells did not significantly change post-IRT compared to pre-IRT. However, we report distinct modulation in T-cell function between PAD and SAD patients post-IRT. Upon α-CD3/CD28 stimulation, proportion of IFN-γ+ CD4 and CD8 T-cells increased in SAD (p = 0.005) but not PAD patients post-IRT compared to baseline. Interestingly, total T-cell proliferation was reduced post-IRT in both PAD and SAD patients, although the reduction in proliferation was primarily due to reduced CD4 T-cell proliferation in PAD (p = 0.025) in contrast to CD8 T-cells in SAD (p = 0.042). In summary, even though IRT provides patients with passive humoral immunity-mediated protection in PAD and SAD, our findings suggest that IRT immunomodulation of T-cells is different in T-cell subsets depending on underlying immunodeficiency."
