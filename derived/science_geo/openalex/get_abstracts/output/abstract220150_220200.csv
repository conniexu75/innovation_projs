Reconstitution with cardiolipin largely restored wild-type stability. The putative interface of complexes III and IV comprises transmembrane helices of cytochromes b and c1 and tightly bound cardiolipin. Subunits Rip1p, Qcr6p, Qcr9p, Qcr10p, Cox8p, Cox12p, and Cox13p and cytochrome c were not essential for the assembly of supercomplexes; and in the absence of Qcr6p, the formation of supercomplexes was even promoted. An additional marked effect of cardiolipin concerns cytochrome c oxidase. We show that a cardiolipin-deficient strain harbored almost inactive resting cytochrome c oxidase in the membrane. Transition to the fully active pulsed state occurred on a minute time scale.

Cardiolipin is an anionic phospholipid consisting of two phosphatidyl residues that are linked by a glycerol moiety (1LeCocq J. Ballou C.E. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In non-photosynthetic eukaryotic cells, it is almost exclusively found in mitochondrial membranes (2Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), where it serves specific roles in mitochondrial structure and function that can be grouped into two categories: stabilization of physical properties of membranes and specific interactions with proteins and modulation of their functions (2Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 3Hoch F.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 71-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Cardiolipin deficiency leads to alteration in the fluidity and stability of mitochondrial membranes. Osmotic stability of mitochondrial membranes is impaired, as apparent from inefficient energy transformation by oxidative phosphorylation, swelling of mitochondria, decreased ATP/oxygen ratio concomitant with increased state 4 respiration, and reduced membrane potential (4Halestrap A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 5Koshkin V. Greenberg M.L. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Specific effects of cardiolipin on oxidative phosphorylation enzymes have been primarily studied using bovine mitochondrial proteins. Cardiolipin binding is essential for the function of the ADP-ATP translocator (6Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Zhiming G. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9031-9038Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and for the stability of respiratory complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) (13Robinson N.C. Zborowski J. Talbert L.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8962-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 14Sedlák E. Robinson N.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14966-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Coupled to the electron transport reactions of complexes III and IV, these respiratory chain complexes generate an electrochemical proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is then used to synthesize ATP by complex V, the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase (15Eble K.S. Coleman W.B. Hantgan R.R. Cunningham C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19434-19440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiolipin binds tightly to bovine complex V, which seems to influence considerably the catalytic and structural properties of this multiprotein complex (16Laird D.M. Parce J.W. Montgomery R.I. Spach P.I. Cunningham C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14851-14856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiolipin appears also to be involved in the membrane attachment of cytochrome c (2Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 17Rytöomaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Decreased cardiolipin synthesis corresponds to cytochrome c release in palmitate-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis (18Ostrander D.B. Sparagna G.C. Amoscato A.A. McMillin J.B. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38061-38067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Some integral membrane proteins have been crystallized, and the binding sites of tightly bound lipids have been localized (19Fyfe P.K. McAuley K.E. Roszak A.W. Isaacs N.W. Cogdell R.J. Jones M.R.

Yoshikawa S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1999; 55 (P06.04.069)Google Scholar). In the structure of yeast complex III, a total of six lipid molecules including one cardiolipin have been detected (22Lange C. Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6591-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 23Palsdottir H. Lojero G.C. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31303-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This cardiolipin molecule is bound tightly in a cavity formed by transmembrane helices of cytochromes b and c1, with the head group of cardiolipin residing in close proximity to the internal site of quinone reduction (Qi) and to the entrance of the cardiolipin/lysine (CL/K) proton conduction pathway. It was suggested that this cardiolipin may have a specific function for the activity of complex III (22Lange C. Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6591-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic mitochondria, cardiolipin is synthesized from the precursors phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidyl-CMP by the cardiolipin synthase Crd1p (24Jiang F. Rizavi H.S. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 25Tuller G. Hrastnik C. Achleitner G. Schiefthaler U. Klein F. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26Chang S.-C. Heacock P.N. Mileykovskaya E. Voelker D. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14933-14941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae null mutant Δcrd1 does not contain cardiolipin. The level of the precursor phosphatidylglycerol is elevated when cells are grown on non-fermentable carbon sources, but only a slight increase is evident on glucose (6Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Zhiming G. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22387-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 25Tuller G. Hrastnik C. Achleitner G. Schiefthaler U. Klein F. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Using the Δcrd1 null mutant and the isogenic wild-type strain under appropriate growth conditions therefore allows discrimination between specific cardiolipin, phosphatidylglycerol, and general lipid effects (6Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Zhiming G. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22387-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Cardiolipin-deficient strains are viable under fermenting and non-fermenting conditions, except at elevated temperature, indicating that cardiolipin is nonessential for oxidative phosphorylation. However, almost complete uncoupling and shut down of oxidative phosphorylation at 40 °C have been described (27Koshkin V. Greenberg M.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In humans, reduced cardiolipin and defective cardiolipin remodeling due to mutations in the tafazzin gene cause Barth syndrome, which is characterized by dilated cardiomyopathy, neutropenia, skeletal myopathy, and abnormal mitochondria (28Vreken P. Valianpour F. Nijtmans L.G. Grivell L.A. Plecko B. Wanders R.J.A. Barth P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Recently, the oxidative phosphorylation enzymes in the mitochondrial membrane of S. cerevisiae were found to be organized into supramolecular assemblies. Respiratory chain complexes III and IV assemble into small and large supercomplexes (29Boumans H. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 30Cruciat C.M. Brunner S. Baumann F. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18093-18096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 31Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar), which comprise dimeric complex III and one or two copies of complex IV, respectively. The major functional role of these supramolecular assemblies or “respirasomes” seems to be substrate channeling of the substrate cytochrome c that enhances the overall quinol oxidase rate (29Boumans H. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 31Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 32Schägger H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Complex V (ATP synthase) was found to exist as a dimer in yeast (33Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The dimeric form seems to be essential for the control of biogenesis of the inner mitochondrial membrane and for generating mitochondrial crista morphology (34Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brèthes D. di Rago J.-P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The state of activity of monomeric and dimeric complex V is controversial. Paumard et al. (34Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brèthes D. di Rago J.-P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) showed comparable ATP hydrolysis activities for the monomeric and dimeric forms of yeast complex V, whereas Tomasetig et al. (35Tomasetig L. DiPancrazio F. Harris D.A. Mavelli I. Lippe G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) reported active monomeric and inactive dimeric forms of bovine complex V. The availability of a Δcrd1 null mutant provided the opportunity to elucidate the specific functions of cardiolipin for the assembly and stability of these oxidative phosphorylation supercomplexes and for the enzymatic properties of the individual complexes. Previously published preliminary results seem to indicate that cardiolipin is essential for the formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes from complexes III and IV (32Schägger H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 36Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43553-43556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The detailed analysis performed in this work reveals a more complex situation and provides insight into the interaction between complexes III and IV: cardiolipin is not essential for the formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes and dimeric ATP synthase in the mitochondrial membrane. However, it stabilizes respiratory chain supercomplexes as well as the individual complexes and is required to prevent formation of the resting state of cytochrome c oxidase in the membrane. Yeast Strains—The yeast strains used in this study were as follows: Δcrd1 (FGY2) and the corresponding parental strain FGY3 (6Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Zhiming G. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22387-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), wild-type W303-1A (37Rothstein R.J. Sherman F. Genetics. 1980; 94: 871-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Δqcr6 (38Schmitt M.E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 268: 11727-11736Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), Δqcr10 (40Brandt U. Uribe S. Schägger H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12947-12953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Δcox12 (41LaMarche A.E. Abate M.I. Chan S.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22473-22480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Δcox13 (42Follmann K. Arnold S. Ferguson-Miller S. Kadenbach B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 45: 1047-1055PubMed Google Scholar). Δcox8 was constructed by replacing the COX8 open reading frame with the HIS3 gene according to Wach et al. (43Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 13: 1793-1808Crossref Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Mitochondria from S. cerevisiae strains were isolated and processed for first dimension blue native (BN) 1The abbreviations used are: BNblue nativeCNcolorless native. PAGE as described (33Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 44Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar), except that the detergent/protein ratios indicated below were used. Staining, quantification of gels, and electroblotting were performed as described (33Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H.

Colorless native (CN) PAGE followed the standard protocol (44Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar), except that acrylamide gradient gels containing no detergent were used. Monoclonal antibodies against S. cerevisiae Cox1p, Cox2p, and Cox3p (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) were used for protein detection. blue native colorless native. Phospholipid Determination—Yeast strains were grown in the presence of 10 μCi of 32P/ml of culture at 30 °C to early stationary phase. Cells were then washed and digested by zymolyase to yield spheroplasts. Total (whole cell) phospholipids were extracted (46Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), separated by one-dimensional thin layer chromatography (47Leray C. Pelletier X. Hemmendinger S. Cazenave J.P. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 420: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Incorporation of radiolabeled [32P]orthophosphate into individual phospholipids is expressed as a percentage of the total radiolabel incorporated into phospholipids. Reconstitution with Cardiolipin—Aliquots of sedimented yeast mitochondria (400 μg of protein) were suspended in 40 μl of 50 mm NaCl and 50 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.0). Cardiolipin (2 μl) from a stock solution (20 mg/ml in 5% digitonin and 50% ethanol) and 1 μl of digitonin (10% in water) were added to set a cardiolipin/protein ratio of 1:10 (g/g) and a digitonin/protein ratio of 0.5 (g/g). Sample preparation for BN-PAGE was as follows. After a 2-h incubation on ice, 10 μl of digitonin (10% stock solution in water) was added to obtain a digitonin/protein ratio of 3 (g/g), which is sufficient for quantitative solubilization. Following centrifugation for 10 min at 100,000 × g, the supernatant was applied to a 1.6 × 10-mm sample well for BN-PAGE. Sample preparation for catalytic activity measurements was similar. After a 2-h incubation on ice, digitonin or dodecyl maltoside was added to obtain detergent/protein ratios of 1, 2, 3, and 4 (g/g) and 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 (g/g), respectively. The samples were used directly without centrifugation. Enzyme Activities—Ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) were measured by the antimycin-sensitive reduction and cyanide-sensitive oxidation of cytochrome c, respectively (550-540 nm; ϵ = 19 mm-1 cm-1) in the presence of 70 μm yeast cytochrome c. Decylbenzoquinol (75 μm) was used as substrate for complex III. Yeast mitochondrial membranes were suspended in 150 mm NaCl and 75 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.0) at 2.8 mg/ml protein and solubilized by dodecyl maltoside (1 g/g of protein) or digitonin (3 g/g of protein). Quinol oxidase (coupled activities of complexes III and IV) was determined by the cyanide-sensitive oxidation of 75 μm decylbenzoquinol (280-290 nm; ϵ = 4.2 mm-1 cm-1) in the presence of 1 μm yeast cytochrome c. The ATP hydrolysis activity of complex V was probed by in-gel lead phosphate precipitation. The original protocol (48Zerbetto E. Vergani L. Dabbeni-Sala F. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) was modified to obtain fast and inhibitor-sensitive ATP hydrolysis rates. After CN-PAGE, gels were incubated for 3 h at room temperature in 35 mm Tris and 270 mm glycine (pH 7.8) with or without addition of 5 μg/ml oligomycin. The buffer was then replaced with 35 mm Tris, 270 mm glycine, 14 mm MgSO4, 0.2% Pb(NO3)2, and 8 mm ATP (pH 7.8). Lead phosphate precipitation was usually detected after ∼10-30 min and continued for 1-3 h. ATP hydrolysis on CN gels was ∼10 times faster than on BN gels and was oligomycin-sensitive in contrast to BN gels. Cardiolipin Effects on Respiratory Chain Supercomplexes and Dimeric ATP Synthase—The cardiolipin-deficient (Δcrd1) and parental strains were grown on glucose, lactate, and glycerol/ethanol. Mitochondria were solubilized by digitonin, and the sizes of solubilized complexes were compared after separation by BN-PAGE (Fig. 1A). In the parental strain, complexes III and IV were found assembled into small and large supercomplexes, which contained dimeric complex III and one or two copies of complex IV, respectively. The ratio of the two supercomplexes varied with the growth conditions as described previously (31Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Upon analysis of the Δcrd1 strain by BN-PAGE, we could detect individual complexes III and IV, but almost no supercomplexes under all growth conditions. Detection of minor amounts of supercomplexes required resolution by SDS-PAGE in the second dimension, as exemplified in Fig. 2. Quantification of complex III on two-dimensional gels from the Δcrd1 mutant revealed that individual complex III was the predominant form and that minor amounts of complex III assembled with complex IV to form supercomplexes. This either could reflect the situation that formation of supercomplexes in the inner membrane of Δcrd1 mitochondria was reduced or may merely indicate that assembled supercomplexes were less stable compared with the parental strain and therefore prone to dissociation under BN-PAGE conditions. For protein solubilization in BN-PAGE, a neutral detergent and the negatively charged dye Coomassie Blue are used. This combination can mimic some properties of an anionic detergent and may lead to dissociation of proteins or complexes. Therefore, we used two additional experimental approaches to look for supercomplexes in solubilized Δcrd1 mitochondria. During gel filtration in the presence of digitonin, major amounts of complexes III and IV (500 and 200 kDa, respectively, for the individual complexes) coeluted with dimeric complex V (1250 kDa) (data not shown). This seemed to indicate that complexes III and IV were still assembled in supercomplexes and that digitonin (in the absence of the anionic dye Coomassie Blue) did not dissociate the supercomplexes of Δcrd1 mitochondria. Similar results were obtained using CN-PAGE. This method follows the protocol for BN-PAGE, except that Coomassie Blue is omitted from the sample and cathode buffers. In contrast to the results obtained with BN-PAGE, significant amounts of respiratory chain supercomplexes from Δcrd1 mitochondria were retained following CN-PAGE (Fig. 1B). SDS-PAGE in the second dimension (data not shown) indicated that major amounts of complex III were assembled in supercomplexes, and minor amounts were found as individual complex III (Table I). We concluded that mitochondrial membranes lacking cardiolipin still contained supercomplexes, but that these were significantly less stable than supercomplexes in the parental strain. Other phospholipids that are increased in the mutant, including phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol (Table II), could not substitute for cardiolipin and could not prevent dissociation of supercomplexes under BN-PAGE conditions (Fig. 1A).Fig. 2Stabilization of respiratory chain supercomplexes by addition of cardiolipin. Mitochondria from parental wild-type (WT) and Δcrd1 strains grown on glycerol/ethanol were used directly (-CL) or after supplementation with cardiolipin (+CL) for BN-PAGE and two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Boxes indicate the expected locations of the large (L) and small (S) supercomplexes, individual complex III (III), and individual complex IV (IV) on the Coomassie Blue-stained two-dimensional gels (upper panels). A, mitochondria from the control parental strain (WT -CL); B, mitochondria from the wild-type strain supplemented with additional cardiolipin (WT +CL); C, mitochondria from the cardiolipin-deficient Δcrd1 strain (Δcrd1 -CL); D, mitochondria from the Δcrd1 strain reconstituted with cardiolipin (Δcrd1 +CL). Supplementation with cardiolipin reduced the amounts of individual complexes III and IV and correspondingly increased the amounts of large and small supercomplexes (see Table III for quantification).

Open table in a new tab Individual complex III from the Δcrd1 strain seemed slightly smaller than free complex III from the parental strain (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). We assign this mass difference to the absence of bound cardiolipin because the subunit composition of complex III was found to be identical in the parental and Δcrd1 strains. In contrast, the lack of cardiolipin had no detectable effect on the size of monomeric and dimeric ATP synthases following BN-PAGE. However, an additional faint band just below the dimeric ATP synthase was usually observed in mitochondria from the Δcrd1 strain (Fig. 1A). This additional band contained subunits of ATP synthase as identified by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (data not shown), but not all subunits could be detected due to the small protein amounts. This additional band was not detected by CN-PAGE (Fig. 1B). We concluded that the lack of cardiolipin had little effect on the stability of dimeric ATP synthase compared with the significant effect on the stability of respiratory chain supercomplexes. The ATP hydrolysis activities of monomeric and dimeric ATP synthases from the wild-type and Δcrd1 strains were similar, as estimated by in-gel lead phosphate precipitation, which correlated with ATP hydrolysis rates (Fig. 1C). This indicates that dimeric ATP synthase is not an inactive form of complex V, as was recently described for the bovine enzyme (35Tomasetig L. DiPancrazio F. Harris D.A. Mavelli I. Lippe G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An ∼10-30-min incubation with ATP was sufficient to observe strong lead phosphate precipitation on gels following CN-PAGE. ATP hydrolysis by monomeric and dimeric complex V from the wild-type and Δcrd1 strains was almost completely oligomycin-sensitive (data not shown). Following BN-PAGE, a comparable precipitation intensity required >10 h of incubation and could not be inhibited by oligomycin. Stabilization of Respiratory Chain Supercomplexes by Addition of Cardiolipin—Mitochondria from Δcrd1 and parental strains grown on glycerol/ethanol were supplemented with cardiolipin and analyzed by BN-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig. 2). In mitochondria from the parental strain, only small amounts of free individual complex IV, which required immunological techniques for detection (Fig. 2A), were found not to be associated with complex III. Upon addition of cardiolipin, this minor amount of individual complex IV was further reduced (Fig. 2B and Table III). Addition of cardiolipin to Δcrd1 mitochondria had a pronounced effect. Using Δcrd1 mitochondria directly, major amounts of complex IV were found as free individual complex IV (Fig. 2C). However, after addition of cardiolipin, a large fraction of this individual complex IV was found assembled with complex III (Fig. 2D). The band of individual complex III was significantly reduced, and the amounts of both supercomplexes containing one and two copies of complex IV, respectively, were significantly increased (Table III). Cardiolipin addition did not affect the ratio of dimeric and monomeric ATP synthases.Table IIICardiolipin-dependent partitioning of total complex III to supercomplexes and individual complex III after BN-PAGEComplex IIIWTWT + CLΔcrd1Δcrd1 + CL%%%%In large"

https://openalex.org/W1975306683,"Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and worldwide. Unfortunately, standard therapies remain inadequate. An increased understanding of the molecular biology of lung cancer biology is required to develop more effective new therapies. In this report, we show that the Wnt pathway is activated through Dishevelled (Dvl) overexpression in NSCLC. Analysis of freshly resected tumors and lung cancer cell lines demonstrate that Dvl-3, a critical mediator of Wnt signaling, is overexpressed. Specifically, Dvl-3 was overexpressed significantly in 75% of fresh NSCLC microdissected samples compared to control paired matched normal lung samples. To evaluate the biological significance of Wnt signaling and, in particular, Dvl function in lung cancer, we transfected siRNA (designed to inhibit selectively human Dvl-1, -2, and -3), to the NSCLC cell line H1703, which is known to have beta-catenin-mediated Tcf-dependent transcriptional activity. Here, we demonstrate that Dvl-specific siRNA treatment in H1703 decreases significantly Dvl and beta-catenin expression, resulting in reduction of Tcf-dependent transcriptional activity, and, importantly, growth inhibition. Taken together, these data support the novel hypothesis that Dvl overexpression is critical to Wnt signaling activation and cell growth in NSCLC."

https://openalex.org/W1994121712,"Immunohistochemical analysis of paired tumor and normal tissue specimens revealed that the expression and cytoplasmic abundance of the RNA-binding protein HuR increased with malignancy, particularly in colon carcinomas. Interventions to modulate HuR expression in human RKO colon cancer cells altered gene expression profiles and identified beta-catenin mRNA as a novel HuR target. Subcutaneous injection of HuR-overexpressing RKO cells into nude mice produced significantly larger tumors than those arising from control populations; conversely, RKO cells expressing reduced HuR through small interference RNA- or antisense HuR-based approaches developed significantly more slowly. We propose that HuR-regulated target mRNA expression contributes to colon cancer growth. Our results suggest a pivotal function for HuR in colon carcinogenesis."

The peroxisome-type Lon protease, which is distinct from the mitochondrial isoform, may play an important role in the peroxisomal biogenesis. Peroxisome is a ubiquitous organelle present in nearly all eukaryotic cells and involved in various oxidative enzymatic reactions such as the α- and β-oxidation of fatty acids. 1The peroxisome website, http://www.peroxisome.org. 1The peroxisome website, http://www.peroxisome.org. Enzymes catalyzing these reactions are well characterized and found in the matrix of the organelle. These matrix proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and imported across its membrane. Proteins localized in the peroxisomal membranes are also known, and some of them are involved in the transport of small metabolites and peroxisomal proteins. Biogenesis of the organelle proceeds via a cellular machinery consisting of more than 20 proteins (peroxins) that effect the recognition, targeting and import of peroxisomal proteins (1.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). In human, dysfunction of the machinery results in inherited metabolic disorders and peroxisome biogenesis disorders such as Zellweger syndrome. Some of the genes responsible for the disease have yet to be identified. To characterize the protein composition of the organelle, therefore, is important not only in studying the proteins involved in the functions of the organelle, but also in elucidating the molecules responsible for the organelle's biogenesis. Because of the rapid expansion of protein sequence databases, mass spectrometry (MS) 2The abbreviations used are: MS, mass spectrometry; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LC, liquid chromatography; PMP70, 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein; PMP22, 22-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; AAA, ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities; PTS-1, peroxisomal targeting signal-1; ACDH, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; ACBP, acyl-CoA-binding protein. 2The abbreviations used are: MS, mass spectrometry; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LC, liquid chromatography; PMP70, 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein; PMP22, 22-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; AAA, ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities; PTS-1, peroxisomal targeting signal-1; ACDH, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; ACBP, acyl-CoA-binding protein.-based identification of proteins, which relies on the sequence data base, is becoming more realistic and more reliable (2.O'Donovan C.

Nature. 2000; 405: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). One important field of application of this emerging technique is to analyze proteins in whole cells and tissues, and thousands of proteins expressed can be detected and identified (5.Washburn M.P.

The same technique can be used to analyze subcellular fractions ranging from organelles to large macromolecular complexes such as ribosomes. Analyzing subcellular fractions reduces the complexity of the samples to be analyzed and should yield more information on the minor protein components that would otherwise escape detection (7.Jung E. Heller M. Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D.F. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3369-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 8.Bell A.W. Ward M.A. Blackstock W.P. Freeman H.N.M. Choudhary J.S.

A classical way of cell fractionation, i.e. differential centrifugation after homogenization, is clearly not adequate for such analyses, since the analytical methods employed may detect minor contaminants. Methods are necessary that allow purification of such macromolecular complexes without losing the structural or functional integrity of the complex. Peroxisomes are usually purified by combining the classical differential centrifugation and density gradient centrifugation. These fractions still contain other contaminating organelles such as mitochondria. In the present study, we combined the Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation with immunoisolation using anti-PMP70 (70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein) antibody. The fractions obtained were practically free from contaminating mitochondria. MS-based proteomic analyses (11.Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (4293) Google Scholar) gave an image of the “proteome” of the liver peroxisomes with the composition and the relative abundance of the protein components. In addition to the known peroxisomal proteins, several endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial proteins, which seem to exist in the organelle, and a few new proteins of unknown function were identified. One of them is a peroxisome-specific isozyme of Lon protease, which acts as molecular chaperone. The protein may play an important role in the biogenesis of the peroxisome. Materials—Polyclonal antibody against rat PMP70 was raised using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 15 amino acids (12.Imanaka T. Shiina Y. Takano T. Hashimoto T. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3706-3713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Specific antibody was purified from rabbit antiserum by affinity chromatography using an antigen-bound column (SulfoLink kit, Pierce). Goat anti-rabbit IgG (Fc fragment-specific) was obtained from the same source. Nycodenz was obtained from Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), while Dynabeads M-500 Subcellular were from DYNAL (Oslo, Norway). Protease inhibitor mixture tablets were purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). Other chemicals and biochemicals were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Preparation of Rat Liver Peroxisomes—The peroxisomal fraction from rat liver was prepared by conventional differential centrifugation in sucrose followed by isopycnic centrifugation in Nycodenz (13.Imanaka T. Lazarow P.B. Takano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1062: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with some modifications. About 0.6 ml of a light mitochondrial fraction-containing peroxisomes was layered onto 10 ml of linear Nycodenz gradient (density span from 1.15 to 1.25 g/ml) in a P40ST rotor (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The gradient rested on a 0.9-ml cushion of 1.30 g/ml Nycodenz. All Nycodenz solutions contained 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) ethanol in 5 mm Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 7.4). Centrifugation was carried out at 77,000 × g for 180 min at 4 °C. Fractions of ∼1.0 ml were collected, and the peroxisome-containing fraction was determined by the distribution of catalase activity (13.Imanaka T. Lazarow P.B. Takano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1062: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Immunopurification of Peroxisomes—Anti-PMP70 specific antibody was bound to magnetic beads (1×108), using an anti-rabbit Fc fragment antibody as a linker antibody according to the manufacturer's instruction. The peroxisome-enriched fractions from the Nycodenz density gradient (about 500 μg of protein) were incubated with the magnetic beads suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA at 4 °C for 6 h. After incubation, bead complexes were collected by placing the reaction tube in a magnet stand. The complex was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA. Peroxisomes were eluted by boiling in 200 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE (80 mm Tris, 4% SDS, 10% sucrose, 0.002% bromphenol blue, and 20 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.8). The supernatant separated by placing in a magnet stand was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Peroxisomal membranes were obtained by incubating the bead-bound peroxisomes with 0.1 m Na2CO3 for 30 min at 4 °C. Bead complexes were washed twice with 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% ethanol, and eluted with the SDS sample buffer as above. In-gel Digestion with Trypsin—The purified peroxisomal fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with MS-compatible silver staining (1% of the sample obtained) (14.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar) or with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) (10% of the sample). For the proteomic analysis a single lane from CBB-stained gel was divided equally into 64 slices of 2-mm width. Each gel slice was cut into small pieces and put into the wells of a 96-well PCR plate (BM Bio, Tokyo, Japan). The gel pieces were destained by rinsing in 50% acetonitrile containing 25 mm NH4HCO3. Disulfide bonds of cysteines were reduced by incubating with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm NH4HCO3 at 56 °C for 1 h and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 25 mm NH4HCO3 at room temperature for 45 min in the dark. Gel pieces were washed with 50% acetonitrile and dried in a vacuum concentrator (SpeedVac, Thermo Savant, NY). Gel pieces were re-hydrated with 15 μl of trypsin solution (10 ng/μl in 50 mm NH4HCO3 containing 5 mm CaCl2). In-gel digestion was performed at 37 °C overnight. Resulting peptides were extracted with 50% acetonitrile containing 5% trifluoroacetic acid. Extracts were dried in Speed-Vac and re-dissolved in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The peptide mixtures thus obtained were subjected to LC/MS and data-dependent tandem mass (LC/MS/MS) analyses. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—LC/MS/MS analysis was carried out in a Q-Tof-type hybrid mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) interfaced on-line with a capillary HPLC (Waters-Micromass modular CapLC, Micromass) (15.Taniguchi H. Suzuki M. Manenti S. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22481-22484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Konishi H. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. Yamamoto T. Matsuzaki H. Takemura Y. Ohmae K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6587-6592Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). A linear gradient of acetonitrile produced was split at a 1:10 ratio, and the slow flow at around 100 nl/min was injected into a nanoLC column (PepMap C18, 75 μm × 150 mm, LC Packings, Amsterdam, Holland). The column eluate was directly injected into a self-constructed nano-spray ion source with a tapered stainless capillary. The LC/MS/MS analysis was carried out in a data-dependent mode; peptide peaks above a certain threshold were subjected automatically to the collision-induced dissociation. Peak lists obtained from the MS/MS spectra were used to identify proteins using Mascot search engine (Matrixscience, London, UK). Immunological Analyses—Antibody against the C-terminal 16 amino acids of RIKEN cDNA 1300002A08 clone, GGFPVKTRPGLIDSKL, was raised in rabbits (MBL, Nagoya, Japan). The distribution of the protein among subcellular fractions was determined by immunoblotting. Each 50 μg of protein of differential centrifugation fractions; nuclear (N), cytoplasmic (S), and light mitochondrial (ML) fractions, were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot membrane was incubated with the antibody and visualized by ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoelectron microscopy of rat liver cells with anti-peroxisomal Lon protease antibody was performed as described previously (17.Yoshihara T. Hamamoto T. Munakata R. Tajiri R. Ohsumi M. Yokota S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent microscopy of human fibroblasts was previously described (18.Shimozawa N. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki Y. Orii T. Shirayoshi Y. Mori T. Fujiki Y. Science. 1992; 255: 1132-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Human fibroblasts used in this study were from a normal, peroxisomal D-bifunctional protein deficiency patient (19.Suzuki Y. Jiang L.L. Souri M. Miyazawa S. Fukuda S. Zhang Z. Une M. Shimozawa N. Kondo N. Orii T. Hashimoto T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 1153-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and a Zellweger syndrome patient (20.Shimozawa N. Nagase T. Takemoto Y. Ohura T. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2003; 120A: 40-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Purification of Peroxisomes by Antibody-conjugated Magnetic Beads—Peroxisomal fractions obtained from the conventional differential centrifugation were further enriched by Nycodenz gradient centrifugation. Fractions containing peroxisomes were determined based on the enrichment of a marker enzyme, catalase. Peroxisome was further purified by immunoisolation with magnetic beads coated with monospecific antibodies against PMP70 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When two samples obtained before and after the immunopurification were compared, a few changes were noticed (Fig. 1A). Several bands disappeared during the purification, while some bands were clearly concentrated. Some of the protein bands that disappeared were cut out and subjected to the in-gel digestion/MS analysis. One protein was found of mitochondrial origin, carboamyl phosphate synthase (Fig. 1A). A few proteins of small molecular weight were from the cytoplasm (data not shown). It should be noted that major mitochondrial and ER proteins such as cytochrome c oxidase and cytochromes P-450 were not detected. Therefore, contaminating mitochondrial and cytoplasmic proteins seem to be effectively removed by the immunopurification. On the other hand, one of the typical peroxisomal membrane proteins, PMP22, was clearly concentrated during the purification. Interestingly, peroxisomal matrix proteins were not uniformly concentrated. The amount of the most abundant matrix protein, catalase, seemed to decrease, while the band corresponding to another major matrix protein, uricase, clearly increased in its intensity (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that there seems to be some leakage of soluble matrix proteins during the purification process, although no drastic change of the composition was noted. Proteins Identified in the Purified Peroxisomes—Each lane in the SDS-PAGE obtained from the purified peroxisomal fractions was evenly cut into 64 slices, regardless of the presence of stained bands, and subjected to the in-gel digestion. The resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed by LC-MS/MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mascot search engine was used to identify proteins in the MS/MS ion search mode. Up to 10 proteins were identified in a single gel slice. Proteins thus identified are summarized in Table I.Table IList of identified proteinsProtein nameNCBI accession numberM.W.Top scoreaProteins showing top scores above 100 (score for mitochondrial carboamyl phosphate synthase) were listed.

Furthermore, two mitochondrial proteins and six ER proteins were identified in addition to the four proteins from other subcellular fractions. Of the known peroxisomal proteins, seven proteins were peroxisomal membrane proteins. In addition to the two major matrix proteins, catalase, and uricase, as mentioned above, 25 proteins of the peroxisomal matrix were found in the list. Most of them are enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. Five proteins were peroxins (Pex1, -2, -3, -13, -14) involved in the various steps of the peroxisome biogenesis. Several mitochondrial and ER proteins identified in the present study can be considered to be authentic peroxisomal proteins rather than contaminating proteins from other organelles. Reasoning for this conclusion will be discussed below in detail. Since we could identify only 5 of 13 peroxins, and three peroxisomal membrane proteins, we have isolated peroxisomal membranes by treating the beads-bound peroxisome with mild alkaline treatment (Na2CO3). The washed membranes were eluted from the magnetic beads, and subjected to the same SDS gel electrophoresis/mass spectrometry-based analysis. The peroxins and peroxisomal membrane proteins thus identified are listed in Table II. We could identify 12 peroxins, and only two peroxins, Pex7 and Pex19, are missing in the list. This is not surprising, since these two proteins are predominantly cytoplasmic. It is interesting to compare the relative amounts of these proteins found in the whole and membrane fractions of the organelle. Pex1 is the most abundant peroxins in the whole fraction, but the amount of the protein relative to other peroxins decreased drastically. Pex1 has been shown to be cytoplasmic when examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Our results suggest that part of the protein is associated with the peroxisome and can be washed away with alkaline treatment. On the other hand, Pex5, which have been predominantly cytoplasmic with a small amount associated with the peroxisome, were found in the washed membrane fractions. The association of the protein, therefore, is stronger to that of Pex1 proteins. All the peroxins that are membrane-bound (Pex2, Pex3, Pex6, Pex10, Pex11, Pex12, Pex13, Pex14, and Pex16) were concentrated in the membrane fraction, demonstrating the efficiency of the isolation method. Similarly, other membrane proteins of the organelle, which were not detected in the whole peroxisomal fraction, were found in the fraction. Judging from the normalized score, the relative abundance of ALDP and ALDPR seems very low compared with that of the abundant peroxisomal membrane proteins such as PMP70 and PMP22.Table IIList of proteins identified in peroxisomal membranesProtein nameNCBI accession numberM.W.Top scoreTotal scoreNormalized scoreTaxonomyLocationCommentPEXs (proteins involved in peroxisome biogenesis)Peroxisomal membrane protein Pmp26p (Peroxin-11)gi 1675824627,9053809711740ratPxPex11Similar to pex5 proteingi:3485842969,51585116391179ratPxPex5Peroxisomal biogenesis factor 3gi 1378619442,1835029781159ratPxPex3Similar to peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11bgi 2767368328,6242046451127ratPxPex11bPeroxisomal membrane anchor proteingi 2545337440,9444409071108ratPxPex14Similar to Peroxisome assembly protein 10 (Peroxin-10)gi 2766338235,122407598851ratPxPex10Peroxisome biogenesis factor 16; peroxin-16gi 2155306938,625235626810mousePxPex16Peroxisomal biogenesis factor 12gi 1675880240,655274469577ratPxPex12Peroxisome assembly factor-1 (PAF-1) (Peroxin-2)gi 12955534,745186345496ratPxPex2Similar to Peroxisomal membrane protein PEX13 (Peroxin-13)gi 2769815745,097168350388ratPxPex13Peroxisome assembly factor-2gi 2911135104,250327608292ratPxPex6Similar to peroxisome biogenesis factor 1gi 2770842019,010110110289ratPxPex1PMPs (peroxisomal membrane proteins)ATP-binding cassette, subfamily D (ALD), member 3; Peroxisomal membrane protein 1gi 698145075,26791565664362ratPx, MemPMP70Fatty acid Coenzyme A ligase, long chain 2; Acyl CoA synthetase, long chaingi 2574273978,128132536162314ratPx, MemLACSPeroxisomal membrane protein 2; peroxisomal membrane protein 2, 22 kDagi 1392879622,5623348701928ratPx, MemPMP22Similar to solute carrier family 25 (mitochondrial carrier; Peroxisomal membrane protein, 34 kDa), member 17gi 2766294634,319558558813ratPx, MemPMP34Peroxisomal membrane protein 4gi 2644916424,121122195404ratPx, MemPMP24Solute carrier family 27 (fatty acid transporter), member 32gi 1392903470,648417417295ratPx, MemVLACSATP-binding cassette, subfamily D (ALD), member 2gi 1537532483,315234234140ratPx, MemALDRPATP-binding cassette, subfamily D, member 1; X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) gene homologgi 667149781,807127180110mousePx, MemALDP Open table in a new tab Proteome of Rat Liver Peroxisome—The positions of protein in SDS-PAGE are shown together with the image of a silverstained gel (Fig. 1B).

https://openalex.org/W2130108221,"Accurate repair of free radical-mediated DNA double-strand breaks by the nonhomologous end joining pathway requires replacement of fragmented nucleotides in the aligned ends by a gap-filling DNA polymerase. Nuclear extracts of human HeLa cells, supplemented with recombinant XRCC4-DNA ligase IV complex (XRCC4/ligase IV), were capable of accurately rejoining model double-strand break substrates with a 1- or 2-base gap, and the gap-filling step was dependent on XRCC4/ligase IV. To determine what polymerase was responsible for gap filling, end joining was examined in the presence of polyclonal antibodies against each of two prime candidate enzymes, DNA polymerases μ and λ, both of which were present in the extracts. For a DNA substrate with partially complementary 3′ overhangs and a 2-base gap, antibodies to polymerase λ completely eliminated both gap filling and accurate end joining, whereas antibodies to polymerase μ had little effect. Immunodepletion of polymerase λ, but not polymerase μ, likewise blocked both gap filling and end joining, and both functions could be restored by addition of recombinant polymerase λ. Recombinant polymerase μ, and a truncated polymerase λ lacking the Brca1 C-terminal domain, were at least 10-fold less active in restoring gap filling to the immunodepleted extracts, and polymerase β was completely inactive. The results suggest that polymerase λ is the primary gap-filling polymerase for accurate nonhomologous end joining, and that the Brca1 C-terminal domain is required for this activity.

Preparation of HeLa Nuclear Extracts—Confluent cultures of HeLa S3 cells grown on 20 plates of 150-mm were harvested by scraping the cells off the plates into 10 ml/plate phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 4 packed cell volumes (PCV) of hypotonic buffer (10 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml PMSF) on ice for 10 min. Cells were lysed by Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes), and the resulting nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min in Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The pelleted nuclei were washed in hypotonic buffer and centrifuged again at 2,000 rpm for 10 min and resuspended in 4 PCV of nuclear extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.42 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 10% sucrose, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml PMSF). The mixture was stirred for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 rpm. The collected supernatant was mixed with 0.33 g of ammonium sulfate per ml of supernatant, and 10 μl of 1 m NaOH per g of ammonium sulfate was added.

End Joining and Gap Filling in Nuclear Extracts—Reaction mixtures contained HeLa nuclear extract (27 μg of protein), 0.1 μg of XRCC4/LigIV (Trevigen), 50 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2, 40 mm KOAc, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 50 μm each of dNTP or dideoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphate (ddNTP), 50 μg/ml BSA, and 20 ng of DNA substrate in a total volume of 20 μl. For antibody inhibition studies, samples were preincubated in the presence of various concentrations of antibodies without DNA substrate for 30 min at 25 °C to allow antibody binding. In some cases, samples were similarly preincubated in the presence of wortmannin (10 μm) in dimethyl sulfoxide (final concentration 2%). Following substrate addition, samples were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C and then deproteinized by treatment with proteinase K followed by phenol/chloroform extraction. DNA was digested with BstXI and XhoI and analyzed on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (13.Gu X.Y. Weinfeld M. Povirk L.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9827-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Intensities of bands corresponding to repair products and intermediates were quantitated by PhosphorImaging and are expressed as a fraction of the total PhosphorImager intensity in the lane, excluding any material that remained in the well. End joining assays with CHO-K1 and XR-1 whole-cell extracts were performed as described previously (4.Chen S. Inamdar K.V. Pfeiffer P. Feldmann E. Hannah M.F. Yu Y. Lee J.W. Zhou T. Lees-Miller S.P.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 22-24PubMed Google Scholar), with incubation for 6 h at 25 °C. Assays for the activity of pol μ and pol λ were performed in 20 μl of the same buffer containing 30 fmol of the 5′-end-labeled 15-mer *pGATCACAGTGAGTAC annealed to a 1.5-fold excess of the 33-mer ACTGGCCGTCGTTCTAATGTACTCACTGTGATC. Immunodepletion—Antibodies (1.35 or 2.7 μg) were bound to 5 μl (bead volume) of protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) by mixing at 900 rpm in antibody binding buffer (0.1 m KOAc, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 50 μg/ml BSA) with a total volume of 250 μl at 4 °C for 16 h in an Eppendorf Thermomixer. Antibody-bound beads were washed 3 times with 400 μl of antibody washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 65 mm KOAc, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2) in order to remove unbound antibodies. HeLa nuclear extract (15 μl) was directly added to the beads and mixed at 900 rpm for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Beads were briefly pelleted in a microcentrifuge; 10 μl of supernatant was removed, and 5 μl was used for each reaction. Samples were incubated and processed as described above. For reconstitution, 70 ng of recombinant pol λ, truncated pol λ, pol μ, or pol β was added to each reaction mixture. Immunodepletion of purified polymerases was performed similarly except that instead of extract, 75 ng of pol β or 120 ng of pol μ or pol λ, in 15 μl of extract storage buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA, was added to protein A beads to which 2.7 μg of antibodies had been adsorbed. Following immunodepletion and washing, 5 μl of supernatant was added to a reaction containing 30 fmol of the labeled 33-mer/15-mer template/primer in 15 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 4% glycerol, 10 μm dNTPs. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h, denatured, and analyzed on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel. Western Blotting—The samples, including MagicMark size standards (Invitrogen), were heat-denatured (100 °C, 5 min), electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 0.2% Tween 20. The dilution for the primary rabbit antibody against human pol μ or mouse pol λ (initial concentration 1.3 mg/ml) was 1:8,000. For chemiluminescence detection, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody was from Pierce and was used at a dilution of 1:20,000. Bound peroxidase signal was detected using a Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). For direct staining, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was from Promega and was used at 1:2,000 dilution. Detected proteins were then stained with Western Blue substrate (Promega), according to the vendor's instructions, and photographed. Gap Filling in Human Nuclear Extracts Is Dependent on XRCC4/LigIV—We showed previously that a model free radical-mediated DSB substrate, with partially complementary phosphoglycolate-terminated 3′ overhangs and a 1-base gap in each strand, could be accurately rejoined by CHO-K1 whole-cell extracts (4.Chen S. Inamdar K.V. Pfeiffer P. Feldmann E. Hannah M.F. Yu Y. Lee J.W. Zhou T. Lees-Miller S.P. Povirk L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24323-24330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and that XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV were required for the gap-filling step as well as for the final ligation (8.Lee J.W. Yannone S.M. Chen D.J. Povirk L.F. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 22-24PubMed Google Scholar). In order to bypass the phosphoglycolate removal step and thus improve the efficiency of end joining, an analogous 3′-hydroxyl terminated vector, with the same partially complementary -ACG 3′ overhangs and 1-base gap in each strand was constructed (Fig. 1). Incubation of this substrate in CHO-K1 whole-cell extracts yielded the expected 43-base XhoI/BstXI fragment (Fig. 2, lane A2), consistent with accurate end joining, and the repair was significantly more efficient than for the comparable 3′-phosphoglycolate substrate (4.Chen S. Inamdar K.V. Pfeiffer P. Feldmann E. Hannah M.F. Yu Y. Lee J.W. Zhou T. Lees-Miller S.P. Povirk L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24323-24330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8.Lee J.W. Yannone S.M. Chen D.J. Povirk L.F. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 22-24PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, ddTTP (lane A4), but not ddATP (lane A3), blocked end joining by trapping the filled in but unligated intermediate. In extracts of XRCC4-deficient XR-1 cells, neither gap-filling (lane A6) nor end joining (lane A5) could be detected, but both could be restored by addition of recombinant XRCC4-LigIV complex (lanes A7-A9). Addition of XRCC4/LigIV appeared to reduce the extent of exonucleolytic degradation (as indicated by formation of 11- to 14-mer fragments; compare lanes A7-A9 with lanes A5 and A6), suggesting that XRCC4/LigIV may help to sequester and protect DNA ends prior to end joining. In order to verify that gap filling was template-dependent, a similar substrate with a 2-base gap in one strand and a 1-base gap in the opposite strand was also constructed. As predicted (see Fig. 1), the predominant in vitro repair product was now 44 bases long (Fig. 2, lanes B2 and B7), and ddTTP trapped a 17-mer intermediate 2 bases longer than the starting substrate (lanes B4 and B9), whereas ddATP trapped an intermediate only 1 base longer (lanes B3 and B8), in each case consistent with the templated fill in of the gap. There was some 16-mer product detected with ddTTP, probably reflecting head-to-head annealing of -ACG overhangs of two different molecules of the labeled substrate (see Fig. 1). Consistent with this proposal, several much shorter (∼20-24-base) end joining products were also detected, the longest of which comigrated with a marker having the sequence of an accurate 24-base head-to-head end joining product (*pTCGAGGAACGCGACGTCGCGTTCC, not shown). As with the 1-base-gap substrate, both gap filling and accurate end joining in XR-1 extracts were completely dependent on addition of XRCC4/LigIV (lanes B5-B9). All these results strongly suggest that 1- or 2-base extension of these substrates in whole-cell extracts represents templated synthesis on DNA ends aligned and annealed by a complex that includes XRCC4/LigIV. Most of the available recombinant end joining proteins that have been cloned are of human origin. Although the nonhomologous DNA end joining pathway appears to be highly conserved among all vertebrates (4.Chen S. Inamdar K.V. Pfeiffer P. Feldmann E. Hannah M.F. Yu Y. Lee J.W. Zhou T.

Pfeiffer P. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 775-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), interaction between proteins of different species may be less than optimal. To avoid these complications, we sought a human system for further complementation experiments. Previous studies showed that whole-cell extracts of human lymphoblastoid cells contain all components necessary for accurate end joining of DSBs with complementary as well as partially complementary 3′ overhangs (4.Chen S. Inamdar K.V. Pfeiffer P. Feldmann E. Hannah M.F. Yu Y. Lee J.W. Zhou T. Lees-Miller S.P. Povirk L.F. J. Biol.

However, in nuclear extracts of HeLa cells, end joining is almost completely dependent on addition of exogenous recombinant XRCC4/LigIV (14.Huang J. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), presumably because it is present only at very low concentrations in these extracts. Thus, HeLa nuclear extracts can be used to assess the requirement for XRCC4/LigIV in gap filling in a human system. As shown in Fig. 3A, the results obtained with nuclear extracts harvested from confluent HeLa cells were essentially identical to those obtained in XRCC4/LigIV-deficient XR-1 extracts, with both gap-filling and accurate end joining being dependent on exogenous XRCC4/LigIV (compare lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 1 and 2). An attempt to assess the sensitivity of end joining to the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor wortmannin was complicated by the inhibitory effect of the solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide) alone. In the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide no end joining was detected (lane 11), but there was some residual gap filling (lane 12), which was blocked completely by wortmannin (lane 10). Thus, as in human whole-cell extracts (4.Chen S. Inamdar K.V. Pfeiffer P. Feldmann E. Hannah M.F. Yu Y. Lee J.W. Zhou T. Lees-Miller S.P. Povirk L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24323-24330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20.Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), a phosphorylation event, probably catalyzed by DNA-PK, appears to be required prior to gap filling. Similar XRCC4/LigIV-dependent gap filling and end joining was seen in commercially available HeLa nuclear extracts (Promega, in vitro transcription grade). With these extracts (Fig. 3B) there was a trace of both end joining and gap filling with unsupplemented extracts (lanes 1 and 2), but addition of exogenous XRCC4/LigIV increased the yield of both end points by more than 10-fold (lanes 3 and 4). Although the extent of accurate end joining was the same with extracts from either source (∼3-4%), the commercial extracts gave somewhat greater gap filling (∼16% versus ∼9%) and were therefore used for subsequent experiments. Nuclear Extracts Contain Both pol μ and pol λ—To determine whether pol μ and pol λ were present in HeLa nuclear extract, proteins in the extract were separated on polyacrylamide gels, and blots were probed with antibodies to each polymerase (Fig. 4). Although both antibodies detected multiple species in the extract, in each case there was a prominent band that comigrated with the corresponding histidine-tagged recombinant at approximately the expected molecular mass, 55 kDa for pol μ and 68 kDa for polλ. Densitometric comparison of chemiluminescence signals produced by various quantities of extract and of each recombinant polymerase suggested that 5 μl of nuclear extract (the amount used in each end joining assay) contained ∼20 ng of pol μ and ∼12 ng of pol λ. Because chemiluminescence-based detection with the pol λ antibodies resulted in relatively high background, a duplicate blot was subjected to direct alkaline phosphatase-based staining, which yielded less background but also resulted in detection of more nonspecific bands on the blot; nevertheless, 5 μl of extract again appeared to be roughly equivalent to 12 ng of pol λ. There was no apparent cross-reactivity of the pol λ antibodies with recombinant pol μ. Gap Filling Is Blocked by Antibodies against pol λ but Not against pol μ—The polymerase that catalyzes gap filling for nonhomologous end joining is not known for certain, but the prime candidates are pol μ and pol λ. In order to assess the participation of these polymerases in end joining in nuclear extracts, polyclonal rabbit antibodies to each polymerase were generated and purified on a protein A affinity column. End joining reactions were then carried out with both the 1- and 2-base-gapped substrates in XRCC4/LigIV-supplemented human nuclear extracts, in the presence of various dilutions of antibodies to each polymerase (Fig. 5). Fill in of the 1-base-gapped substrate was dramatically reduced by antibodies to pol λ, whereas preimmune antibodies, or antibodies to pol μ, had little effect. pol λ antibodies also completely blocked fill in of a 2-base gap, and again, preimmune and pol μ antibodies did not. These results suggest that, at least in this in vitro system, pol λ rather than pol μ is primarily responsible for alignment-based gap filling. pol μ and pol λ Are Specifically Immunodepleted by Polyclonal Antibodies—To determine whether the respective antibodies could be used to specifically immunodeplete pol μ and pol λ, immunobeads bearing preimmune, pol μ or pol λ antibodies were prepared. Dilute solutions of pol λ (8 μg/ml), pol λ (8 μg/ml), and pol β (5 μg/ml) were immunodepleted with each antibody, and then polymerase activity in the supernatant was assessed on a simple 33-mer/15-mer template/primer. As shown in Fig. 6A, immunodepletion with pol λ antibodies reduced pol λ activity dramatically, although not quantitatively, whereas preimmune antibodies or antibodies to pol μ had little effect. pol β, despite its close homology to pol λ, was not immunodepleted by any of the antibodies. In several experiments, immunodepletion with pol μ antibodies consistently eliminated pol μ activity completely, but this enzyme appeared to be extremely sensitive to the immunodepletion procedure and lost most of its activity even in the absence of antibodies. However, a direct comparison of pol μ and pol λ activity on the same template/primer, without immunodepletion, showed that although pol λ was more processive, pol μ was only about 2-fold less efficient than pol λ in adding the 1st base (Fig. 6B). Gap Filling Is Restored by Recombinant pol λ—To determine whether the effect of pol λ antibodies on gap filling was due to inactivation of pol λ, the same antibodies were preadsorbed to protein A-agarose beads, and extracts were immunodepleted with the beads. End joining was then examined in immunodepleted extracts complemented with recombinant pol λ (Fig. 7). Like simple antibody addition, immunodepletion with pol λ antibodies, but not with preimmune antibodies, completely blocked accurate end joining (Fig. 7A, lane 4). In the presence of ddTTP, immunodepletion with pol λ antibodies blocked fill in of a 2-base gap (Fig. 7, B, lanes 5 and 9, and D, lane 4), whereas depletion with preimmune antibodies (Fig. 7, B-D) or antibodies to pol μ (Fig. 7D, lane 3) had relatively little effect. Addition of recombinant pol λ to extracts immunodepleted with pol λ antibodies restored both end joining (Fig. 7A, lane 5) and gap filling (Fig. 7, B, lanes 6 and 10, and D, lanes 6 and 7). pol λ expressed in bacteria or in yeast (Fig. 7D, lane 7, λY) were equally effective in restoring gap filling. In fact, gap filling and end joining in the pol λ-complemented extract were greater than in the extracts depleted with preimmune antibodies or exposed to protein A beads alone, suggesting that pol λ was a limiting factor in gap filling. When pol λ-depleted extracts were supplemented with various amounts of recombinant pol λ, ∼6 ng were required for half-maximal gap filling (Fig. 7E). Because undepleted, unsupplemented extracts contained ∼12 ng of pol λ and augmentation with recombinant pol λ enhanced gap filling slightly, this result suggests that the efficiency of recombinant pol λ in gap filling was comparable with that of the endogenous enzyme in the extracts. All these results confirm the implication of pol λ as the primary polymerase for alignment-based gap filling in these extracts. Intriguingly, although pol μ antibodies did not block gap filling, addition of recombinant pol μ to the pol λ-depleted extracts resulted in a detectable level single-base gap filling (Fig. 7F, lane 4) and apparent inaccurate head-to-head end joining (lane 8); in some experiments (not shown) a trace of the accurate 44-base head-to-tail product was also detected. However, the extent of gap filling and accurate end joining was only about 5-10% of the level seen with pol λ. These results suggest that pol μ may be capable of substituting for pol λ in gap filling but with markedly lower efficiency. This difference in efficiency is much greater than was seen for polymerization on a simple template/primer (Fig. 6B). No gap filling was detected when pol β was added to pol λ-depleted extracts (Fig. 7D, lane 5), suggesting that pol β cannot substitute for pol λ in this capacity. Interactions among DNA repair proteins are often mediated by Brca1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains (21.Huyton T. Bates P.A. Zhang X. Sternberg M.J. Freemont P.S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To determine whether the BRCT domain of pol λ was required for alignment-based gap filling, gap filling was examined in pol λ-immunodepleted extracts supplemented with a truncated form of pol λ which contained the polymerase domain but lacked the BRCT domain (Fig. 7C). Like pol μ, the truncated pol λ (λT) produced at most only a trace of gap filling (∼0.8 versus 16% for full-length pol λ, as est"

https://openalex.org/W1983474840,"Interactions between proteasome and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors have been examined in human leukemia cells in relation to induction of apoptosis. Simultaneous exposure (24 h) of U937 myelomonocytic leukemia cells to 100 nM flavopiridol and 300 nM MG-132 resulted in a marked increase in mitochondrial injury (cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO release, loss of deltaPsi(m)), caspase activation, and synergistic induction of cell death, accompanied by a marked decrease in clonogenic potential. Similar effects were observed with other proteasome inhibitors (e.g., Bortezomib (VELCADE trade mark bortezomib or injection), lactacystin, LLnL) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (e.g., roscovitine), as well as other leukemia cell types (e.g., HL-60, Jurkat, Raji). In U937 cells, synergistic interactions between MG-132 and flavopiridol were associated with multiple perturbations in expression/activation of signaling- and survival-related proteins, including downregulation of XIAP and Mcl-1, activation of JNK and p34(cdc2), and diminished expression of p21(CIP1). The lethal effects of MG-132/flavopiridol were not reduced in leukemic cells ectopically expressing Bcl-2, but were partially attenuated in cells ectopically expressing dominant-negative caspase-8 or CrmA. Flavopiridol/proteasome inhibitor-mediated lethality was also significantly diminished by agents and siRNA blocking JNK activation. Lastly, coadministration of MG-132 with flavopiridol resulted in diminished DNA binding of NF-kappaB. Notably, pharmacologic interruption of the NF-kappaB pathway (e.g., by BAY 11-7082, PDTC, or SN-50) or molecular dysregulation of NF-kappaB (i.e., in cells ectopically expressing an IkappaBalpha super-repressor) mimicked the actions of proteasome inhibitors in promoting flavopiridol-induced mitochondrial injury, JNK activation, and apoptosis. Together, these findings indicate that proteasome inhibitors strikingly lower the apoptotic threshold of leukemic cells exposed to pharmacologic CDK inhibitors, and suggest that interruption of the NF-kappaB cytoprotective pathway and JNK activation both play key roles in this phenomenon. They also raise the possibility that combining proteasome and CDK inhibitors could represent a novel antileukemic strategy."

https://openalex.org/W2168945351,"A better understanding of changes in gene expression during ovarian tumorigenesis and the identification of specific tumor markers may lead to novel strategies for diagnosis and therapy for this disease. Using our serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) data, as well as public SAGE databases that contained a total of 137 SAGE libraries representing a wide variety of normal and neoplastic tissues, we identified five novel SAGE tags specifically expressed in ovarian cancer. Database analysis, cloning and, sequencing of the corresponding expressed sequence tags revealed details about these transcripts that we named human ovarian cancer-specific transcripts (HOSTs). HOST1 was found to be identical to the gene encoding ovarian marker CA125 (MUC16). HOST2 is a novel gene containing multiple copies of retroviral-related sequences without an obvious open reading frame. HOST3 encodes the tight-junction protein claudin-16 (CLDN16). HOST4 encodes a poorly characterized proteoglycan link protein (LP), and HOST5 codes for a type II sodium-dependent phosphate transporter (SLC34A2). Except for MUC16, these genes have not previously been shown to be expressed in ovarian or other cancers. Northern blot analysis confirmed that HOST genes are rarely expressed in normal tissues or nonovarian cancers, but are frequently expressed in ovarian cancer-derived cell lines and primary tumors. Moreover, HOST genes are upregulated in all four major subtypes of ovarian cancer compared to cultivated ovarian surface epithelial cells, as concluded by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using a panel of microdissected ovarian tumors. The sodium-dependent phosphate transporter (HOST5/SLC34A2) expression was associated with increased differentiation in ovarian serous tumors. While the roles of HOSTs in ovarian malignant transformation remain unclear, we propose that HOSTs may represent alternative targets for diagnosis and therapy and of this deadly disease."
https://openalex.org/W2045907809,"Bovine PDEdelta was originally copurified with rod cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) and shown to interact with prenylated, carboxymethylated C-terminal Cys residues. Other studies showed that PDEdelta can interact with several small GTPases including Rab13, Ras, Rap, and Rho6, all of which are prenylated, as well as the N-terminal portion of retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator and Arl2/Arl3, which are not prenylated. We show by immunocytochemistry with a PDEdelta-specific antibody that PDEdelta is present in rods and cones. We find by yeast two-hybrid screening with a PDEdelta bait that it can interact with farnesylated rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) and that prenylation is essential for this interaction. In vitro binding assays indicate that both recombinant farnesylated GRK1 and geranylgeranylated GRK7 co-precipitate with a glutathione S-transferase-PDEdelta fusion protein. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques exploiting the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of PDEdelta and dansylated prenyl cysteines as fluorescent ligands, we show that PDEdelta specifically binds geranylgeranyl and farnesyl moieties with a Kd of 19.06 and 0.70 microm, respectively. Our experiments establish that PDEdelta functions as a prenyl-binding protein interacting with multiple prenylated proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2055229669,"Intense investigation has centered on understanding the regulation of integrin cell adhesion receptors. In the present study, we propose that variant N-glycosylation represents an important mechanism for regulation of beta1, but not beta3 or beta5 integrins. We find that expression of oncogenic ras in HD3 colonocytes causes increased alpha2-6 sialylation of beta1 integrins, whereas expression of dominant-negative ras induces decreased alpha2-6 sialylation, relative to cells with wild-type ras. In contrast, neither beta3 nor beta5 integrins are alpha2-6 sialylated, regardless of the state of ras activation. Results from RT-PCR analyses suggest that differential integrin sialylation is due to a ras-dependent alteration in the expression of ST6Gal I, the enzyme that adds alpha2-6-linked sialic acids. Cells that express differentially sialylated beta1 integrins exhibit altered adhesion to collagen I (a beta1 ligand), but not to vitronectin (a beta3 or beta5 ligand). Similarly, the enzymatic removal of cell surface sialic acids from control cells alters binding to collagen, but not to vitronectin. Finally, using a cell-free receptor/ligand-binding assay, we show that purified, desialylated alpha1beta1 integrins have diminished collagen-binding capability, providing strong evidence that sialic acids play a causal role in regulating beta1 integrin function."

We designed microarray-based experiments to characterize the relative contributions of each mechanism, and unexpectedly, we found that distinct functional gene groups show preference for one mechanism over the others. We propose that such a distribution may provide signaling specificity to enable regulatory proteins to turn on or off entire pathways that determine cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W1980925168,"We recently described a novel checkpoint pathway that functions early in mitosis to delay chromosome condensation in response to microtubule poisons. The only gene implicated so far in this checkpoint pathway is chfr, whose protein product contains a RING domain and has ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. The significance of this activity in vivo is unclear. A recent report suggested that the Chfr protein targets itself for proteasome-dependent degradation in mitotic cells through autoubiquitination. However, we observe that in mitosis Chfr exhibits a phosphorylation-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift with no change in overall protein levels. Further analysis of its ubiquitin ligase activity revealed that Chfr can catalyse the formation of noncanonical Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains with Ubc13-Mms2 acting as the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Ubc13-Mms2 and Lys63-polyubiquitin chains are not associated with targeting proteins to the proteasome, but rather with signaling cellular stress. We propose that Chfr may have a role in signaling the presence of mitotic stress induced by microtubule poisons."

In addition, the ability of the parasite to oxidize exogenous NADH, as well as the insensitivity of respiration to rotenone and its sensitivity to flavone, suggested the presence of an alternative NADH-quinone (NADH-Q) oxidoreductase. Rotenone-insensitive respiration and membrane potential generation in the presence of malate suggested the presence of a malate-quinone oxidoreductase.

An uncoupling effect of fatty acids was partly reversed by bovine serum albumin and GTP but was unaffected by carboxyatractyloside. These results provide the first biochemical evidence of the presence of an alternative NADH-Q oxidoreductase and a malate-quinone oxidoreductase and confirm the operation of oxidative phosphorylation in malaria parasites. Intraerythrocytic stages of mammalian malaria parasites have been considered for a long time to rely primarily on anaerobic glycolysis for energy production and to possess mitochondria that lack oxidative phosphorylation and a functional tricarboxylic acid cycle (1.Vaidya A.B. Sherman I.W. Malaria, Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis and Protection. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 355-368Google Scholar). A study using a flow cytometry assay developed to monitor the mitochondrial membrane potential of Plasmodium yoelii yoelii inside erythrocytes concluded that the malaria mitochondria did not contribute much to the ATP pool and that these parasites lack the machinery for oxidative phosphorylation (2.Srivastava I.K. Rottenberg H. Vaidya A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3961-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). However, these conclusions were in contrast to the relevance of mitochondrial activity for the chemotherapy of malaria. The antimalarial drug atovaquone has been shown to inhibit electron transport at the bc1 complex (3.Fry M. Pudney M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and to collapse the mitochondrial membrane potential in P. yoelii yoelii (2.Srivastava I.K. Rottenberg H. Vaidya A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3961-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and this effect has been shown to be enhanced by another antimalarial agent, the drug proguanil (4.Srivastava I.K. Vaidya A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1334-1339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).More recent studies using the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei berghei have demonstrated the capacity of mitochondria in trophozoites to sustain oxidative phosphorylation and calcium transport in the presence of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (5.Uyemura S.A. Luo S. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9709-9715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).

The genes necessary for a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle were identified. However, it was indicated that it remains unclear whether the tricarboxylic acid cycle is used for the full oxidation of products of glycolysis or to supply intermediates for other biosynthetic pathways (6.Gardner M.J. Hall N. Fung E. White O. Berriman M. Hyman R.W. Carlton J.M. Pain A. Nelson K.E. Bowman S. Paulsen I.T. James K. Eisen J.A. Rutherford K. Salzberg S.L. Craig A. Kyes S. Chan M.S. Nene V. Shallom S.J.

Despite the finding of almost all the subunits of the ATP synthase in these parasites, the contribution of mitochondria to the ATP pool was considered to be minimal (6.Gardner M.J. Hall N. Fung E.

The mitochondria of P. yoelii could also be uncoupled in the presence of fatty acids as occurs with P. berghei mitochondria (5.Uyemura S.A. Luo S. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9709-9715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESP. yoelii yoelii—P. yoelii yoelii (strain 17XL, a gift of Akhil B. Vaidya) was maintained in vivo in male Balb/c mice by weekly transfer infection. Blood was collected in citrate-glucose buffer in the ascending phase of parasitemia and was checked for the presence of reticulocytes, which was minimal. Red blood cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's PBS by centrifugation at 4 °C at 1,500 × g for 5 min. Washed erythrocytes were diluted 1:2 in PBS and passed over a powdered cellulose column (CF11; Whatman, Clifton, NJ) to remove leukocytes and platelets (19.Homewood C.A. Neame K.D. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1976; 70: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Contamination of the resulting preparations with white blood cells was always less than 5% as determined by using a Neubauer chamber and Giemsa staining. Red blood cells depleted of leukocytes and platelets were washed once as described above and resuspended in PBS. Infected erythrocytes were enriched using the Percoll method (20.Dluzewski A.R. Ling I.T. Rangachari K. Bates P.A. Wilson R.J.M. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1984; 78: 622-624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Infected erythrocytes within the 70% Percoll interphase were collected and contained predominantly trophozoites (85–90% of the red blood cells, the rest containing ring stage and schizont forms), which were identified by examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears. To isolate the parasites, infected erythrocytes were lysed with 0.1 mg/ml saponin in PBS at room temperature for 5 min. After centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove red blood cell membranes, the parasites were washed five times in buffer A (116 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2). The parasites were resuspended at 1 × 108 cells/ml in the same buffer. Contamination of the preparation with red blood cells was negligible. Contamination with white blood cells (mostly lymphocytes) was always less than 1% as determined using a Neubauer chamber and Giemsa staining (typically we obtained about 1.2–1.3 × 109 trophozoites contaminated with 1.0–1.15 × 107 white blood cells/mouse).Control experiments were also done with blood enriched in reticulocytes. Reticulocytosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 0.06 mg of phenylhydrazyne hydrochloride/g of weight to Balb/c mice. This procedure increased the level of reticulocytes to 10–20% after 3 days of inoculation (21.Viens P. Chevalier J.L. Sonea S. Can. J. Microbiol. 1971; 17: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After 3 days, the reticulocytes were collected using the same procedure employed to isolate P. yoelii-infected red blood cells. To isolate possible contaminating mitochondria, enriched reticulocytes were then submitted to the same procedures used to isolate trophozoites (lysis with saponin (except where indicated) and five washes with buffer A). The final pellet, containing reticulocyte mitochondria, was resuspended in buffer A at an equivalent or higher protein concentration of the isolated trophozoites described above.Chemicals—ADP, antimycin A, ascorbate, ATP, atractyloside, digitonin, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), GTP, oligomycin, potassium cyanide, rotenone, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD), and valinomycin were purchased from Sigma. Carboxyatractyloside was from Calbiochem. All other reagents were analytical grade.Oxygen Uptake Measurements—Oxygen uptake was measured with a Clark-type electrode (5.Uyemura S.A. Luo S. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9709-9715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) fitted to a Gilson oxygraph (Gilson Medical Electronics, Inc., Middleton, WI) in 1.5 ml of standard incubation medium containing 125 mm sucrose, 65 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm potassium phosphate, and 0.5 mm EGTA at 30 °C. Other additions are indicated in the figure legends.Determination of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨ)—The mitochondrial membrane potential was determined by measuring the fluorescence spectrum of safranine O (8.Vercesi A.E. Bernardes C.F. Hoffmann M.E. Gadelha F.R. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14431-14434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer, at 30 °C. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 495 and 586 nm, with a slit of 5 mm. To evaluate the effect of exogenous substrates, trophozoites were kept at 4 °C for 1–2 h to deplete them of endogenous substrates. The valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potential was used to perform a calibration curve, in a potassium-free medium containing 200 mm sucrose, 10 mm Na+-Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.0 mm sodium phosphate, and 0.5 mm EGTA. Energized mitochondria were incubated with safranine O in the presence of valinomycin, and titration with K+ was performed. The ΔΨ decay caused by the electrogenic influx of the cation determined by the Nerst equation (22.Akerman K.E.O Wikstrom K.F. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) is linearly correlated to the increase in the fluorescence intensity of the dye as it is released from the mitochondria. The additions are indicated in the figure legends. Each experiment (oxygen uptake and membrane potential measurements) was repeated at least three times with different cell preparations, and the figures show representative experiments.SDS Electrophoresis and Preparation of Western Blots—P. yoelii trophozoites (1 × 109) were resuspended in 100 μl of Dulbecco's PBS. Aliquots (10 μl, about 30 μg of protein) were mixed with 10 μl of electrophoresis buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 10% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4.0% (w/v) SDS, 4.0% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min prior to application to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. White potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum) were obtained from a local supermarket, and crude mitochondria were prepared as described before (23.Beavis A.D. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3079-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of crude potato mitochondria and reticulocyte fraction (about 30 μg of protein) were mixed with electrophoresis buffer and treated as described above. Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (24.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76 (4350): 4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (44705) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus.The blots were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS and kept overnight at 4 °C. Polyclonal antisera raised against plant uncoupling mitochondrial protein (PUMP) from potato generously supplied by Drs. I. Maia and P. Arruda (Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, Brazil) were used. A 1:1,000 dilution of antiserum in blocking buffer was applied to blots at 25 °C for 60 min. The nitrocellulose was washed three times for 15 min each with T-PBS buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) before the addition of a 1:20,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG in blocking buffer for 30 min. The immunoblots were visualized on radiographic film (Kodak) using the ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).Sequence Analysis—A TBLASTN search of all available sequence data bases using the amino acid sequence of NADH-Q oxidoreductase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae led to the identification of a putative NADH-Q oxidoreductase from P. yoelii yoelii (98128572 P. yoelii 17XNL GENOMIC MALPY00984; EAA22988). The predicted amino acid sequence of P. yoelii NADH-Q oxidoreductase was aligned with the sequences of other NADH-Q oxidoreductases by using the Biology Workbench 3.2 utility. The sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree were done using CLUSTAL W (25.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55183) Google Scholar) and PHYLIP phylogeny packages (version 3.5c) (26.Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar) following the method of Saitou and Nei (27.Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar).Fluorescence Microscopy—For fluorescence microscopy, the use of saponin for isolation of the P. yoelii-infected red blood cells or reticulocytes was omitted. Both cells were incubated in a medium contained RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1.5 mm GTP, 130 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm NADH, 5 mm glutamate, 5 mm succinate, 5 mm α-glycerophosphate, and 1 μg/ml rhodamine 123 (Rd123; final volume, 1 ml; pH 7.2) for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 1 min and washed with RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum. This step was repeated four times, and the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 and observed in the fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX60). For inhibition studies we used an inhibitor mixture containing 1.5 mm azide, 1 μg/ml oligomycin, 1 mm KCN, and 10 μm atractyloside.RESULTSOxidative Phosphorylation in Mitochondria in Situ—The addition of a very low concentration of digitonin (2 μm) to a suspension of P. yoelii trophozoites incubated in the standard buffer containing 10 mm malate was followed by a very small increase in the rate of oxygen uptake, indicating that the plasma membrane became permeable to the respiratory substrate (Fig. 1A). The subsequent addition of ADP induced a small but reproducible increase in respiration, indicating the transition from resting (state 4) to phosphorylating (state 3) respiration. Oligomycin (1.25 μg/ml) inhibited respiration in agreement with the operation of oxidative phosphorylation. The addition of FCCP (1 μm) after oligomycin partly released the state 4 respiration, which was inhibited by antimycin A. The addition of the exogenous respiratory substrate system TPMD/ascorbate, which reduces the respiratory complex IV, restarted respiration, which was partly inhibited by KCN. Similar results were obtained when 10 mm succinate was used as substrate (Fig. 1B, trace a), except that in this particular case the addition of digitonin did not seem to stimulate respiration. This was probably due, despite several washes, to the permeabilization of the plasma membrane of trophozoites by the saponin treatment of the infected red blood cells performed to isolate the parasites (see “Experimental Procedures”). The addition of ADP was nevertheless able to stimulate respiration (Fig. 1B, trace a). To rule out the possibility that the residual respiration observed after KCN was due to ascorbate autoxidation, we performed a similar assay in the absence of TMPD/ascorbate, and the respiration was completely inhibited (Fig. 1A, inset).Because P. yoelii, as well as other Plasmodium species, has a marked predilection for invading reticulocytes (28.Mons B. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 299-312PubMed Google Scholar) and reticulocytes possess mitochondria, it was important to rule out the possibility that the respiratory activity measured was due to the presence of contaminating mitochondria in the preparations of isolated trophozoites. We therefore induced reticulocytosis in mice by intraperitoneal injection of phenylhydrazine and, after 3 days of inoculation, submitted the blood from these mice to the same procedures used to isolate trophozoites to isolate possible contaminating mitochondria. At higher protein concentrations (2 mg of protein) than those used for isolated trophozoites (0.6 mg of protein), the respiratory activity of these preparations was very low (Fig. 1B, trace b). Only the addition of TMPD/ascorbate increased respiration, which was only partially sensitive to KCN and possibly caused by ascorbate autoxidation.Presence of a NADH-Q Oxidoreductase—Genes encoding for putative alternative NADH-Q oxidoreductases have been reported to be present in the P. falciparum (6.Gardner M.J.

We therefore tested the ability of exogenous NADH to stimulate respiration of P. yoelii mitochondria in situ. The addition of exogenous NADH (Fig. 2A, trace b) resulted in the stimulation of respiration over the basal levels in the absence of substrates (Fig. 2A, trace a). This NADH-dependent respiration was insensitive to rotenone even at a high concentration of the inhibitor (30 μm) but was sensitive to flavone (Fig. 2A, trace b), a drug that has been used as an inhibitor of the alternative NADH-Q oxidoreductase from S. cerevisiae (28.Mons B. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 299-312PubMed Google Scholar, 29.de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 30.Kitajima-Ihara T. Yagi T.

Translation of the open reading frame yielded a polypeptide of 569 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 64.4 kDa. A CLUSTALW alignment (25.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55183) Google Scholar) of NADH-Q oxidoreductase peptide sequences from bacteria, fungal, plant, and protozoa was then used as the basis for the generation of a phylogenetic tree. The results (data not shown) suggested that P. yoelii and P. falciparum enzymes shared a most recent common ancestor. T. brucei, fungal, and plant NADH-Q-oxidoreductases were the closest out groups to the Plasmodium sequences.Determination of the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨ) in Situ—ΔΨ is a very sensitive indicator of the energy-coupling condition of mitochondria. The dye safranine O distributes electrophoretically into the mitochondria in response to ΔΨ; the uptake/release of the dye by the organelle is linearly correlated to ΔΨ up to at least 150 mV. Permeabilization of the membrane of trophozoites in the standard buffer containing succinate was followed by a large decrease in the fluorescence response, reaching a steady state after 3 min (Fig. 3, trace a). The addition of ADP was followed by a small upward deflection compatible with utilization of the electrochemical proton gradient to drive ADP phosphorylation by ATP synthase (Complex V). As expected, this fluorescence decrease was completely reversed by oligomycin, a known inhibitor of the enzyme. The addition of antimycin A (AA) promoted a fast upward deflection of the tracing, compatible with depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane and return of safranine to the water phase. Preparations obtained from reticulocyte-enriched blood, either treated (Fig. 3, trace d) or untreated (Fig. 3, traces b and c) with saponin, and at protein concentrations higher (Fig. 3, traces b and c) than those used for isolated trophozoites"

We showed that the expression of a Vpu-green fluorescent fusion protein prevented the proteosomal degradation of βTrCP substrates such as β-catenin, IκBα, and ATF4, which are normally directly targeted to the proteasome for degradation. β-Catenin was translocated into the nucleus, whereas the tumor necrosis factor-induced nuclear translocation of NFκB was impaired. β-Catenin was also up-regulated in cells producing Vpu+ human immunodeficiency virus type 1 but not in cells producing Vpu-deficient viruses. The overexpression of ATF4 also provoked accumulation of β-catenin, but to a lower level than that resulting from the expression of Vpu. Finally, the expression of Vpu induces the exclusion of βTrCP from the nucleus. These data suggest that Vpu is a strong competitive inhibitor of βTrCP that impairs the degradation of SCFβTrCP substrates as long as Vpu has an intact phosphorylation motif and can bind to βTrCP.

Vpu is an integral membrane protein of 81 amino acids (aa). Its two principal biological functions are associated with different structural domains of the protein. Vpu increases the release of virus particles from the plasma membrane (1.Strebel K. Klimkait T. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3784-3791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) through its N-terminal transmembrane domain (aa 1-27), whereas it mediates the degradation of the CD4 receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (2.Willey R.L. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 226-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) via its cytoplasmic domain (aa 28-81). It was shown recently that Vpu exerts a positive effect on HIV-1 infectivity by down-modulating CD4 receptor molecules at the surface of HIV-1-producing cells (3.Levesque K. Zhao Y.S. Cohen E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28346-28353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). CD4 degradation requires the phosphorylation of the serine residues at positions 52 and 56 of the Vpu cytoplasmic domain by casein kinase II (4.Schubert U. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2260-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the binding of Vpu to CD4 trapped in the ER via the formation of a complex with the HIV-1 envelope precursor gp160 (5.Bour S. Schubert U.

Virology. 1996; 223: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We showed previously that Vpu binds to the F box protein β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP), the receptor component of the multisubunit SCF-βTrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and connects CD4 to the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery. βTrCP is linked to the SCF complex by binding to Skp1 through its N-terminal F box motif and interacts with Vpu through its C-terminal WD repeat region (7.Margottin F.

Margottin-Goguet F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2192-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). βTrCP also plays a role in the processing and degradation of p105 and p100, the precursors of the active p50 and p52 NFκB subunits (20.Orian A. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Fajerman I. Eytan E. Israel A. Mercurio F. Iwai K. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2580-2591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Fong A. Sun S.C. J. Biol.

Ley S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 402-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The signal for the recognition of all these cellular ligands by βTrCP is the phosphorylation of one or two serine residues present in a conserved motif, DSGXXS for Vpu, β-catenin, and IκBα and DSGXXXS for ATF4, p105, and p100.As βTrCP controls essential cellular signaling pathways, such as the Wnt-β-catenin and the NFκB pathways, by degrading the above-mentioned substrates via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, we wondered whether Vpu exerts a generalized inhibitory effect on multiple substrates of βTrCP and impairs their degradation. This could have major consequences on signaling in HIV-infected cells in vivo. Recently, Bour et al. (23.Bour S. Perrin C. Akari H. Strebel K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15920-15928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Vpu blocks IκBα degradation mediated by TNFα signaling. Subsequently, Akari et al. (24.Akari H. Bour S. Kao S. Adachi A. Strebel K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1299-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) showed that Vpu induces proapoptotic activity through this effect. Here we demonstrate that expression of Vpu, either as a full-length HIV-1 proviral DNA or fused to green fluorescent protein, impairs β-catenin degradation and up-regulates its transcriptional activity. Moreover, the degradation of ATF4 and IκBα was inhibited, as was TNFα-induced NFκB nuclear translocation. Finally, we demonstrated that Vpu induces the cytoplasmic sequestration of βTrCP. All these effects required an intact DSGXXS phosphorylation motif.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Transfections—HeLa cells and 293T human embryo kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen). HeLa cells were transiently transfected by electroporation when using plasmids encoding HA-ATF4, Vpu-GFP, Vpuc-GFP, or βTrCP-FLAG or by the calcium method when using pNL4-3 or its variants. 293T cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method.Plasmids—Proteins bearing the Vpu cytoplasmic domains (Vpuc) or wild-type Vpu fused to the GFP were constructed by PCR from plasmids expressing the full-length Vpu molecular clone of HIV-1LAI or a Vpu-phosphorylated mutant with an HA epitope at the C terminus (6.Margottin F. Benichou S. Durand H. Richard V. Liu L.X. Gomas E. Benarous R. Virology. 1996; 223: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) by using appropriate primers. Vpu2.6 carries serine to asparagine mutations at positions 52 and 56. Amplified fragments were digested with HindIII and ApaI and then inserted into the corresponding sites of a pcDNA3.1/Myc-His plasmid (Invitrogen) in which the Myc-His sequence had been replaced by the green fluorescent protein (GFP) deleted of its ATG (19.Lassot I. Segeral E. Berlioz-Torrent C. Durand H. Groussin L. Hai T. Benarous R. Margottin-Goguet F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2192-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These constructs (Vpuc-HA-GFP, Vpuc2.6-HA-GFP, Vpu-HA-GFP, and Vpu2.6-HA-GFP) were named Vpuc-GFP, Vpuc2.6 GFP, Vpu-GFP, and Vpu2.6-GFP, respectively, for simplicity.The pcDNA3-ΔFβTrCP construct was described previously (7.Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). We used a pcDNA3-ΔFβTrCP-tagged Myc/Hist, in which the ΔFβTrCP coding sequence was amplified by PCR and inserted in fusion with the Myc/histidine double tag in the pcDNA3.1 Myc/HisA vector (15.Kroll M. Margottin F. Kohl A. Renard P. Durand H. Concordet J.P. Bachelerie F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Benarous R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7941-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human ATF4 plasmid was described previously (19.Lassot I. Segeral E. Berlioz-Torrent C. Durand H. Groussin L. Hai T. Benarous R. Margottin-Goguet F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2192-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). βTrCP-FLAG was constructed by inserting the human βTrCP cDNA into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pSGFLAG (a gift from P. Jalinot, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon). pNL4-3, the HIV1 clone, and its Vpu-deficient mutant were gifts from Dr. K. Strebel.Western Blotting Analysis—Samples containing 8 × 106 HeLa cells were transiently transfected by electroporation with Vpuc-GFP, Vpuc2.6-GFP, Vpu-GFP, Vpu2.6-GFP, or HA-ATF4. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.05 m Tris buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.001 m EDTA, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors. The amount of cell lysate loaded on gels was normalized. Protein lysates were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto a Hybond P membrane, and probed with antibodies. The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-β-catenin antibody (clone 14; Transduction Laboratories); mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin and goat polyclonal anti-actin antibodies (TU-02 sc-8035 and I-19 sc-1616 respectively; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science); IκB-α mouse monoclonal antibody (H-4 sc16-43; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (F3165, Sigma). Membranes were developed with the ECL or ECL Plus kits (Amersham Biosciences) and used to expose film.Pulse-Chase Analysis—To perform pulse-chase analysis of endogenous β-catenin, 8 × 106 HeLa cells were transiently transfected with 30 μg of Vpuc-GFP or Vpuc2.6-GFP. Twenty four hours later, cells were divided into four fractions, incubated for 30 min in methionine- and cysteine-free medium, and pulse-labeled for 30 min with 0.130 mCi of [35S]methionine and -cysteine. They were then chased with fresh medium for the indicated times (see Fig. 3). Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.05 m Tris buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.001 m EDTA, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors. After centrifugation of the lysates, β-catenin was immunoprecipitated by a mouse anti-β-catenin monoclonal antibody (dilution 1:100) for 90 min and then incubated with protein G-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h. After three washes with lysis buffer supplemented with NaCl (0.150 m final concentration) and one wash in lysis buffer with 0.3 m NaCl (final concentration), immune complexes were eluted with Laemmli buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, 30% methanol and dried. They were then used to expose film and analyzed with an ImageQuant PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Luciferase Assays—293T cells were plated in 6-well flat-bottom plates on the day prior to transfection at a density of 5 × 104 cells/35-mm-diameter well. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method with the mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene). We used the luciferase reporter Top-TK-Luciferase plasmid containing multimerized synthetic Lef/Tcf-binding sites fused to the luciferase reporter gene under the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter (TK) (8.Hart M. Concordet J.P. Lassot I. Albert I. del los Santos R. Durand H. Perret C. Rubinfeld B. Margottin F. Benarous R. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 207-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with 0.2 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.1 μg to 1 μg of the constructs. One ng of pRL-TK-Renilla luciferase (PRL-TK from Promega) was included as an internal transfection efficiency control. The total amount of transfected plasmids was held constant at 5 μg by a DNA carrier. After 24 h, the cells were lysed, and the ratios between both luciferase activities were determined with enzyme assay kits (Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System, Promega). Luminescence was quantified by use of a Lumat LB9507 luminometer (EG & G Instruments) from duplicate plates. The results represent data from four independent experiments. The data were normalized by function of transfection efficiency.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Transfected HeLa cells were cultured on glass coverslips. Twenty-four hours later, HeLa cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, quenched for 10 min with 0.1 m glycine in PBS, and permeabilized for 30 min at room temperature with 0.1% Triton, PBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The coverslips were incubated with the primary mouse β-catenin antibody, HIV-1 serum (National Institutes of Health), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (F3165, Sigma), or mouse monoclonal NFκB p65 antibody (F6 sc-8008 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h (1:500, 1:650, 1:2500, 1:100 dilutions, respectively) and with the secondary Cya3- or Cya5-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-human antibodies (1:750 for Cya3 and 1:500 dilutions for Cya5; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 30 min. For the endogenous βTrCP study, cells were permeabilized for 30 min at room temperature with 0.05% saponin, 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The coverslips were incubated with the primary rabbit polyclonal anti-βTrCP antiserum raised against the N-terminal domain (aa 3-192) of h-βTrCP for 1 h (1:750) (7.Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) and with the secondary Cya3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:750; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 30 min. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Bio-Rad MRC1000 instrument.RESULTSAccumulation of β-Catenin in HeLa Cells in the Presence of Vpu—To determine whether the expression of Vpu results in the accumulation of β-catenin, we constructed expression vectors in which either wild-type Vpu (Vpu-GFP) or Vpu mutated at the two serine residues (S52N-S56N) of the DSGXXS motif required for binding to βTrCP (Vpu2.6-GFP) was fused with GFP. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with these plasmids, and the level of β-catenin expression was assessed by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-β-catenin antibodies. The expression of increasing amounts of Vpu-GFP resulted in the accumulation of β-catenin (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1-5 with lane 13). In contrast, similar amounts of the mutated form of Vpu had no effect on the amount of β-catenin present (Fig. 1, compare lanes 11 and 12 to lane 13). Similar amounts of β-catenin accumulated when only the cytoplasmic domain (residues 21-81) of Vpu (Vpuc-GFP) was fused to GFP (Fig. 1, compare lanes 6-10 to lane 13). By comparing different dilutions of the cell lysates, we estimated that the accumulation of β-catenin was more than 10-fold higher in the presence of Vpuc-GFP than in untransfected cells, whereas the mutated form (Vpuc2.6-GFP) had no effect (data not shown). Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu with an intact DSGXXS phosphorylation motif is necessary and sufficient to allow the accumulation of β-catenin.Fig. 1Expression of Vpu-GFP or Vpuc-GFP in HeLa cells results in the accumulation of β-catenin. Increasing amounts (5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 μg) of Vpu-GFP (lanes 1-5, respectively) or Vpuc-GFP (lanes 6-10, respectively) and 20 and 30 μg of Vpu2.6-GFP (lanes 11 and 12, respectively) were transfected into HeLa cells by electroporation. Western blotting analysis was carried out using anti-β-catenin (upper panel), anti-actin (middle panel), or anti-HA (bottom panel) antibodies, as the HA epitope is fused to Vpu in all Vpu-GFP constructs. NT indicates untransfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of Vpu Results in the Accumulation of β-Catenin Both in the Cytoplasm and in the Nucleus—We carried out immunofluorescence studies to determine whether the accumulated β-catenin was translocated into the nuclei of the Vpu-transfected HeLa cells. The intracellular localizations of Vpu-GFP, Vpuc-GFP, Vpu2.6-GFP, and Vpuc2.6-GFP were evaluated by direct fluorescence after transfection (Fig. 2, left panels). Vpu-GFP and Vpu2.6-GFP were found in the cytoplasm and in the perinuclear region of transfected cells (Fig. 2, a and c), confirming previous observations (25.Klimkait T. Strebel K. Hoggan M.D. Martin M.A. Orenstein J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 621-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Schubert U. Bour S. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Maldarell F. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 809-819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Vpuc-GFP and Vpuc2.6-GFP, both of which lack the Vpu transmembrane anchor domain, were found both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, e and g). The intracellular level of β-catenin was considerably higher in Vpu-GFP- or Vpuc-GFP-transfected cells than in non-transfected cells (Fig. 2, b and f). β-Catenin accumulated both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. However, no β-catenin accumulated in the non-phosphorylated mutants Vpu2.6-GFP- and Vpuc2.6-GFP (Fig. 2, d and h)-transfected cells.Fig. 2Accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin in cells expressing Vpu-GFP or Vpu-c-GFP but not Vpu2.6-GFP or Vpuc2.6-GFP. Direct fluorescence and immunofluorescence assays were carried out 24 h after the transfection of HeLa cells with plasmids expressing Vpu-GFP (a and b), Vpu2.6-GFP (c and d), Vpuc-GFP (e and f), Vpuc2.6-GFP (g and h). Left panels, cells were examined by direct fluorescence to detect transfected cells; right panels, cells were fixed and stained with anti-β-catenin antibody to detect endogenous β-catenin. The stars indicate some of untransfected cells, and the arrows show cells transfected with Vpu constructs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thus, the expression of Vpu-GFP and Vpuc-GFP not only leads to elevated levels of β-catenin but also to the translocation of the accumulated β-catenin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.β-Catenin Degradation Is Impaired by Expression of Vpu—To characterize further the mechanism by which expression of Vpu results in the accumulation of β-catenin, we measured β-catenin protein stability by pulse-chase analysis after 35S-metabolic labeling in vivo. HeLa cells were transfected with Vpuc-GFP or Vpuc2.6-GFP, and 24 h later cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 30 min. The amount of labeled β-catenin was determined by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. β-Catenin was more stable in Vpuc-GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 3A, middle panel) than in untransfected cells (left panel) and than in cells transfected with Vpuc2.6-GFP (right panel). Quantification of the labeled β-catenin allowed us to estimate that the half-life of β-catenin was about 15 min in untransfected cells and in Vpuc2.6-GFP-transfected cells and over 60 min in Vpuc-GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Thus, β-catenin accumulates following the expression of Vpu because its constitutive degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is inhibited. Once again, the DSGXXS-binding motif is required for this effect.Vpu Promotes β-Catenin Activation in 293T Cells—To test whether the β-catenin accumulated upon expression of Vpu was able to activate the transcription of target genes, we used the TOP luciferase reporter system (27.Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar). This reporter gene contains multiple β-catenin-dependent Lef/Tcf sites that drive the luciferase gene. 293T cells were co-transfected with this reporter plasmid plus either Vpuc-GFP, Vpuc2.6-GFP, or ΔFβTrCP (a positive control for the accumulation of β-catenin) (8.Hart M. Concordet J.P. Lassot I. Albert I. del los Santos R. Durand H. Perret C. Rubinfeld B. Margottin F. Benarous R. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 207-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). We observed about a 3-fold increase of the luciferase activity in cells transfected by Vpuc-GFP compared with cells transfected with Vpuc2.6-GFP (Fig. 4). Such differences in luciferase activity were significant (p < 0.05) as determined by a t test (Statview F software) between cells transfected by Vpuc-GFP or Vpuc2.6-GFP (the luciferase activity is 21.17 ± 2.22 in the presence of 0.5 μg of Vpuc-GFP versus 6.25 ± 0.585 in the presence of 0.5 μg of Vpuc2.6-GFP; p = 0.0006). Transfection with the Vpuc2.6-GFP had no effect compared with the negative control, and transfection with the negative transdominant form of βTrCP, ΔFβTrCP, had a slightly greater effect than Vpu (about 4.5-fold activation) (Fig. 4). Thus, the expression of Vpu results not only in the physical accumulation of the β-catenin protein but, more importantly, in the constitutive transcriptional activation of the β-catenin-Lef/Tcf-dependent genes.Fig. 4Expression of Vpuc-GFP increases β-catenin transcriptional activity. 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with 200 ng of Top-TK-luciferase reporter construct and 1 ng of pRL-TK-Renilla together with the indicated amount (in μg) of Vpu-GFP, Vpuc2.6-GFP, or ΔFβTrCP plasmids. Twenty four hours later, luciferase activities were measured. The Top-TK-luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Normalized values (in arbitrary units) of four independent experiments (each carried out in duplicate) are shown. The mean ± S.D. are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)β-Catenin Also Accumulates in Cells Expressing Full-length HIV-1 Proviral DNA Containing Vpu—To determine whether Vpu in the context of a full-length HIV-1 genome also induces the accumulation of β-catenin, HeLa cells were transfected with pNL4-3 plasmid expressing Vpu or with a Vpu-deficient pNL4-3 plasmid (28.Schubert U. Clouse K.A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7699-7711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Production of HIV-1 proteins and of β-catenin was checked by immunofluorescence double labeling using total anti-HIV1 human antiserum from HIV-infected patients and mouse monoclonal anti-β-catenin antibodies, respectively. β-Catenin accumulated in cells transfected with pNL4-3 expressing Vpu (Fig. 5, d or f) but not in cells transfected with a Vpu-deleted proviral NL4-3 DNA (c or e). Furthermore, the accumulated β-catenin is translocated to the nucleus (h). Hence, HIV-1-producing cells produce enough Vpu to induce the accumulation of β-catenin. This suggests that the up-regulation of β-catenin detected in HIV-1-producing cells in vitro should also take place in HIV-1-infected cells in vivo.Fig. 5β-Catenin accumulates in cells producing HIV-1 NL4-3 Vpu+ but not in cells producing HIV-1 NL4-3 Vpu- HeLa cells were transfected with pNL4-3-expressing Vpu (right panels) or with a Vpu-deficient pNL4-3 (left panels) and cultured on glass coverslips. Twenty-four hours later, HeLa cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized. HIV-1-producing cells were detected by use of a human anti-HIV-1 serum (a and b) and a secondary Cya3-conjugated anti-human antibody. β-Catenin was detected with a mouse anti-β-catenin antibody and a secondary Cya5-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (c and d). Confocal microscopy was performed with a Bio-Rad MRC1000 microscope. e and f show the same images as c and d, respectively, but more exposed in white and black to improve the visualization of the untransfected cells. g and h show the overlay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Delocalization of βTrCP from the Nucleus to the Cytoplasm of HeLa Cells Expressing Vpu—Next, we investigated whether βTrCP, which is essentially found in the nucleus (19.Lassot I.

The βTrCP fused to the FLAG epitope (βTrCP-FLAG) was mainly detected in the nucleus (Fig. 6A, a). In cells co-transfected with βTrCP-FLAG and Vpu-GFP, βTrCP was clearly redistributed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fig. 6A, d-f). In contrast, in cells co-transfected with the phosphorylation mutant Vpu2.6-GFP, βTrCP was only detected in the nucleus, as in the control (see Fig. 6A, g-i). Although the antibodies against βTrCP were not excellent, rabbit anti-βTrCP antibodies showed that endogenous βTrCP was excluded from the nucleus to the cytoplasm following the production of Vpu-GFP (Fig. 6B). No βTrCP was detected in the nucleus of Vpu-transfected cells, whereas βTrCP remained in the nucleus of untransfected cells. These results suggest that the binding affinity of Vpu for βTrCP is sufficiently high to sequester most of the endogenous βTrCP in the cytoplasm of the transfected ce"
https://openalex.org/W2016577476,"During early embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, extensive vesicle transport occurs to build cell boundaries for 6,000 nuclei. Here we show that this important process depends on a functional complex formed between the tumour suppressor and adaptor protein Discs-Large (Dlg) and the integral membrane protein Strabismus (Stbm)/Van Gogh (Vang). In support of this idea, embryos with mutations in either dlg or stbm displayed severe defects in plasma membrane formation. Conversely, overexpression of Dlg and Stbm synergistically induced excessive plasma membrane formation. In addition, ectopic co-expression of Stbm (which associated with post-Golgi vesicles) and the mammalian Dlg homologue SAP97/hDlg promoted translocation of SAP97 from the cytoplasm to both post-Golgi vesicles and the plasma membrane. This effect was dependent on the interaction between Stbm and SAP97. These findings suggest that the Dlg-Stbm complex recruits membrane-associated proteins and lipids from internal membranes to sites of new plasma membrane formation."
https://openalex.org/W2003706637,"The nucleoporin Nup98 gene is frequently rearranged in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In most cases this results in fusion of the N terminus of Nup98 to the DNA binding domain of a homeodomain transcription factor. The prototype of these fusions, Nup98-HOXA9, is associated with human AML and induces AML in mouse models. To understand the mechanisms by which Nup98-HOXA9 causes AML, we expressed it in myeloid cells and identified its target genes using high density oligonucleotide microarrays. The analysis was performed in triplicate and was confirmed by quantitative real time PCR. Of the 102 Nup98-HOXA9 target genes identified, 92 were up-regulated, and only 10 were down-regulated, suggesting a transcriptional activation function. A similar analysis of wild-type HOXA9 revealed 13 target genes, 12 of which were up-regulated, and 1 was down-regulated. In contrast, wild-type Nup98 had no effect on gene expression, demonstrating that the HOXA9 DNA binding domain is required for gene regulation. Co-transfection experiments using a luciferase reporter linked to the promoter of one of the Nup98-HOXA9 target genes confirmed up-regulation at the transcriptional level by Nup98-HOXA9 but not by either HOXA9 or Nup98. These data indicate that Nup98-HOXA9 is an aberrant transcription factor whose activity depends on the HOXA9 DNA binding domain but has a stronger and wider transcriptional effect than HOXA9. Several of the genes regulated by Nup98-HOXA9 are associated with increased cell proliferation and survival as well as drug metabolism, providing insights into the pathogenesis and epidemiology of Nup98-HOXA9-induced AML.

Nup98 is present both at the nuclear pore complex and within the nuclear interior (16.Griffis E.R. Altan N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Powers M.A. Mol. Biol.

It has been reported that Nup98 is present on fibrillar structures inside the nucleus, suggesting a role in intranuclear trafficking (17.Fontoura B.M. Dales S. Blobel G. Zhong H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3208-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).

Finally, there is evidence that the FG repeat region of Nup98 can activate transcription from a GAL4-responsive promoter when attached to a GAL4 DNA binding domain, suggesting a possible role for Nup98 in transcription (26.Kasper L.H.

Homeodomain transcription factors are involved in patterning the anteroposterior axis of the body during embryonic development (27.Alberts B. Johnson A. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Walter P.

Hawley R.G. Stem Cells. 2002; 20: 364-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the homeodomain fusion partners of Nup98, including HOXA9, belong to the so-called Abd-B group of HOX genes that includes paralogous groups 9–13 (2.Kraemer D. Wozniak R.W. Blobel G. Radu A.

Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2003; 36: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Class II includes genes such as PMX1, PBX1, and MEIS1, that are scattered throughout the genome (30.Owens B.M. Hawley R.G. Stem Cells. 2002; 20: 364-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HOXA9 has been shown to bind DNA cooperatively with PBX1 and/or MEIS1 (32.Shen W.F. Rozenfeld S. Kwong A. Kom ves L.G. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3051-3061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Shen W.F. Montgomery J.C. Rozenfeld S. Moskow J.J. Lawrence H.J. Buchberg A.M. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the normal functions of HOXA9 are not well understood, there is ample evidence that it is involved in the pathogenesis of AML, particularly in collaboration with MEIS1. HOXA9 overexpression can immortalize myeloid progenitors in vitro and inhibit some of their differentiation pathways (34.Calvo K.R. Sykes D.B. Pasillas M. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3274-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). When mice are transplanted with bone marrow cells overexpressing HOXA9, they develop AML in an average of 128 days, a period that is shortened to 57 days by MEIS1 coexpression (35.Kroon E. Thorsteinsdottir U. Mayotte N. Nakamura T. Sauvageau G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HOXA9 and MEIS1 are frequently coexpressed in human AML (36.Lawrence H.J. Rozenfeld S. Cruz C. Matsukuma K. Kwong A. Komuves L. Buchberg A.M. Largman C. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1999; 13: 1993-1999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Nup98-HOXA9 fusion results in replacement of the transcriptional regulatory region of HOXA9 by the FG repeat region of Nup98 (Fig. 1). In contrast to wild-type Nup98, the Nup98-HOXA9 chimera is primarily intranuclear (26.Kasper L.H. Brindle P.K. Schnabel C.A. Pritchard C.E. Cleary M.L. van Deursen J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 764-776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nup98-HOXA9 increases the proliferative capacity of bone marrow progenitors (35.Kroon E. Thorsteinsdottir U. Mayotte N. Nakamura T. Sauvageau G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 37.Calvo K.R. Sykes D.B. Pasillas M.P. Kamps M.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4247-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Transplanting mice with hematopoietic stem cells that express Nup98-HOXA9 induces a myeloproliferative disease with development of AML within an average of 230 days (35.Kroon E. Thorsteinsdottir U. Mayotte N. Nakamura T. Sauvageau G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Coexpression of Nup98-HOXA9 with MEIS1 shortens the period of AML development to an average of 142 days (35.Kroon E. Thorsteinsdottir U. Mayotte N. Nakamura T. Sauvageau G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Coexpression of Nup98-HOXA9 with the Bcr-Abl fusion oncoprotein reduces the period to AML even further, to 21 days (38.Dash A.B. Williams I.R. Kutok J.L. Tomasson M.H. Anastasiadou E. Lindahl K. Li S. Van Etten R.A. Borrow J. Housman D. Druker B. Gilliland D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7622-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that Nup98-HOXA9 plays a causative role in the development of AML, although additional factors may be necessary for rapid induction of a full-blown AML phenotype. The mechanisms by which Nup98-HOXA9 and other Nup98 fusions contribute to the pathogenesis of AML are not well understood. In this study we provide strong evidence that Nup98-HOXA9 acts as an aberrant transcription factor in myeloid cells and identify 102 target genes. Of these, 92 are up-regulated, whereas only 10 are down-regulated, indicating that Nup98-HOXA9 acts primarily as a transcriptional activator. In contrast, wild-type HOXA9 has only 13 target genes, and Nup98 has none. Several of the genes induced by Nup98-HOXA9 are associated with increased cell proliferation and survival, suggesting possible pathways involved in leukemogenesis. Interestingly, the gene encoding a drug-metabolizing enzyme, CYP3A5, is markedly induced by Nup98-HOXA9 and may explain some aspects of the epidemiology of Nup98-HOXA9-associated AML, particularly its association with etoposide treatment and its incidence in Asian populations. Cell Culture—K562 cells (ATCC, CCL-243) were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). GP-293 packaging cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Plasmid Constructs—Nup98-HoxA9 and full-length Nup98 cDNAs with N-terminal HA tags in pUHD10S vector (39.Porter C.M. Clipstone N.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4936-4945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were a kind gift from Dr. Jan van Deursen (Mayo Clinic). The cDNAs were subcloned into the MSCV-IRES-GFP retroviral expression vector, kindly provided by Dr. Neil Clipstone (Northwestern University) (39.Porter C.M. Clipstone N.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4936-4945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length Nup98 was digested out of pUHD10S with EcoR1 and ligated into the EcoRI site of MSCV-IRES-GFP. Nup98-HoxA9 was digested out of puHD10s with EcoRI and XbaI (New England Biolabs) followed by filling in the recessed ends with Klenow and ligating into the HpaI site of MSCV-IRES-GFP. Wild-type HA-tagged human HOXA9 was constructed by PCR, checked by sequencing, and similarly subcloned into the HpaI site of MSCV-IRES-GFP. The Nup98, HOXA9, and Nup98-HOXA9 cDNAs were also subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) using the EcoRI (Nup98) and EcoRI-XbaI (HOXA9 and Nup98-HOXA9) sites. Retrovirus Production and Infection—The retroviral expression vectors were cotransfected with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein plasmid (pVSV-G) into the GP-293 packaging cell line using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Plasmid-containing medium was removed 24 h post-transfection and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and the cells were incubated at 32 °C. Virus-containing supernatant was then collected 48 h post-transfection and stored at –80 °C before use. K562 cells were suspended in viral supernatant at 2 × 105 cells/ml in the presence of 8 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma). The cells were seeded in a 24-well plate and subjected to spinoculation at 500 × g for 2 h at room temperature followed by replacement of the viral supernatant with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing cells were then sorted 48 h post-infection using a Beckman Coulter Elite ESP cell sorter. Western Blot Analysis—GFP-expressing cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer 48 h after sorting, and the protein equivalent of 1 × 105 cells was subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The respective proteins were detected using the anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science). RNA Isolation and Oligonucleotide Array Expression Analysis—Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from K562 cells 48 h post-sorting using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Total RNA quality control was performed by running 25–50 ng on an RNA 6000 Nano Assay (Agilent) using a Bioanalyzer 2100. For labeling, 2 μg of good quality total RNA was reverse-transcribed with an oligo-dT-T7 (Genset), and double-stranded cDNA was generated with the superscript double-stranded cDNA synthesis custom kit (Invitrogen). In an in vitro transcription step with T7 RNA polymerase (MessageAmp aRNA kit from Ambion), the cDNA was linearly amplified and labeled with biotinylated nucleotides (Enzo Diagnostics). Ten μg of labeled and fragmented cRNA was then hybridized onto a human genome U133A expression array (HG-U133A) (Affymetrix) for 16 h at 45 °C. Post-hybridization staining and washing were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, chips were scanned with a Hewlett Packard argon-ion laser confocal scanner at the Microarray Facility of the Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Image and Data Analysis—The microarray image data were first quantitated using MAS 5.0 (microarray suite) with the default parameters for the statistical algorithm and all probe set scaling with a target intensity of 500. The data were then filtered so that both the absolute value of the fold change was greater than or equal to 2, and the change in p value was less than or equal to 0.001. Additionally we removed genes that were scored as increasing and also scored as absent (A) in the numerator (i.e. the experiment in the ratio whose value is the numerator) and genes scored as decreasing and scored as absent in the denominator (also referred to as the base-line experiment). Experiments were done in replicate, and we chose a conservative procedure for combining the replicate data. We intersected the filtered list for each replicate given a list of genes that passed the filtered criteria for all of the replicates. Real-time PCR—Real-time PCR was performed on cDNA synthesized from RNA isolated from K562 cells infected with either empty MSCV-IRES-GFP or Nup98/HOXA9 retroviral constructs using the iCycler iQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The iCycler was formatted for 96-well plates containing 25-μl PCR reactions. PCR master mixes were made such that each 25-μl reaction contained 12.5 μl of iQ Sybr Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 2 μl of cDNA template (diluted 1:200), and 0.8 μm sense and antisense gene primers. PCR conditions consisted of an initial denaturing step for 5 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of a 3-segment step consisting of denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C, annealing for 30 s at 55 °C, and elongation for 30 s at 72 °C. Real-time analysis was taken during the 30-s annealing step. After real-time analysis, a melting curve was established for all samples to ensure specific amplification. Gene quantification was determined based upon a relative standard curve from a dilution series of the template cDNA (1:20, 1:200,1:2000, and 1:20000). A negative control where no template DNA was used was run on each plate as well as a comparison of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase between the MSCV-IRES-GFP and Nup98/HOXA9 samples. Glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase served to equilibrate the starting material between the two experimental conditions. All unknown samples as well as controls were run in triplicate on the same plate (except for the negative control). Data analysis was performed using the iCycler iQ Optical System Software Version 3.0a (Bio-Rad). Transfection of K562 Cells and Luciferase Assay—K562 cells were transfected with a 10 μg of the pXP1/cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) construc"

https://openalex.org/W1980662406,"The underlying molecular mechanisms leading to microsatellite alteration and mutations in human lung cancer remain unknown. Since Flap endonuclease1 (Fen1), which functions in the base excision repair system, has been shown to be involved in tumor progression of mouse models with microsatellite instability in a haplo-insufficient manner, we performed expression and mutation analyses for FEN1 in human lung cancer cell lines. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis revealed that all 49 lung cancer cell lines (20 small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) and 29 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs)) expressed FEN1. In addition, microarray analysis showed that FEN1 expression was elevated significantly by 1.65-fold (P=0.001) in SCLC cell lines compared to normal lung controls (normal human lung cultures and immortalized normal human bronchial epithelial cell lines). FEN1 protein was abundantly expressed in all 23 lung cancer cell lines (10 SCLCs and 13 NSCLCs) and was expressed at lower levels in three of four normal lung epithelial culture controls. Direct sequencing of genomic DNAs revealed no FEN1 mutation in seven SCLCs and nine NSCLCs. As part of this analysis we discovered and sequenced a FEN1 pseudogene (GenBank accession #AY249897) located at 1p22.2. This pseudogene is amplified from cDNA preparations contaminated with genomic DNA and must be taken into account in any FEN1 mutation analysis studies. Our results suggest that alterations of FEN1 are not likely to contribute to development of lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2088750149,"The recently discovered cyclotides kalata B1 and kalata B2 are miniproteins containing a head-to-tail cyclized backbone and a cystine knot motif, in which disulfide bonds and the connecting backbone segments form a ring that is penetrated by the third disulfide bond. This arrangement renders the cyclotides extremely stable against thermal and enzymatic decay, making them a possible template onto which functionalities can be grafted. We have compared the hydrodynamic properties of two prototypic cyclotides, kalata B1 and kalata B2, using analytical ultracentrifugation techniques. Direct evidence for oligomerization of kalata B2 was shown by sedimentation velocity experiments in which a method for determining size distribution of polydisperse molecules in solution was employed. The shape of the oligomers appears to be spherical. Both sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments indicate that in phosphate buffer kalata B1 exists mainly as a monomer, even at millimolar concentrations. In contrast, at 1.6 mm, kalata B2 exists as an equilibrium mixture of monomer (30%), tetramer (42%), octamer (25%), and possibly a small proportion of higher oligomers. The results from the sedimentation equilibrium experiments show that this self-association is concentration dependent and reversible. We link our findings to the three-dimensional structures of both cyclotides, and propose two putative interaction interfaces on opposite sides of the kalata B2 molecule, one involving a hydrophobic interaction with the Phe6, and the second involving a charge-charge interaction with the Asp25 residue.

J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) are a recently discovered family of circular proteins that have been isolated from various Rubiaceae and Violaceae plants. They are one of several groups of naturally occurring circular proteins discovered in a wide range of micro- and higher organisms over recent years (2.Trabi M. Craik D.J. Trends Biochem.

In addition to their head-to-tail cyclized peptide backbones, they all share a high sequence similarity as well as the striking feature of a cystine knot: two disulfide bonds and their connecting backbone segments form a ring that is penetrated by the third disulfide bond. This cyclic cystine knot (CCK) 1The abbreviations used are: CCK, cyclic cystine knot; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; rpm, revolutions per minute. 1The abbreviations used are: CCK, cyclic cystine knot; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; rpm, revolutions per minute. motif (4.Craik D.J. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1809-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), i.e. the combination of circular peptide backbone and knotted disulfide arrangement, renders the cyclotides extremely stable, both against thermal degradation and enzymatic digest. Anecdotal evidence from the 1970s, for example, indicates that African tribeswomen prepared a birth-facilitating tea by boiling the leaves of a local plant, Oldenlandia affinis. On investigation of this uterotonic agent it was shown that its main components were macrocyclic peptides, predominantly kalata B1 and kalata B2 (5.Gran L. Lloydia. 1973; 36: 174-178PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to this uterotonic effect, cyclotides show a broad range of other biological activities, including antimicrobial (6.Tam J.P. Lu Y-A. Yang J-L. Chiu K-W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8913-8918Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), cytotoxic (7.Lindholm P. Göransson U. Johansson S. Claeson P. Gullbo J.

Ramjit H. Ransom R.W. Wood T. Sardana M. J. Nat. Prod. 1994; 57: 1619-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Their natural function in plants appears to be as defense molecules (11.Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar).Synthetic cyclization is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry to enhance the stability and biological lifetime of small peptides. It is proposed that because of their exceptional stability the cyclotides may serve as useful protein templates for biopharmaceutical applications (12.Craik D.J. Simonsen S. Daly N.L. Curr. Opin. Drug. Discov. Devel. 2002; 5: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar). The aim is to graft pharmacologically relevant peptide epitopes onto the stable CCK framework. Since knowledge of protein oligomerization and self-association behavior under various solution conditions will be vital in the evaluation of its suitability as a biopharmaceutical, we studied the sedimentation properties of two prototypic cyclotides, kalata B1 and kalata B2, with the purpose of shedding light on their properties in solution. These molecules were the first cyclotides to be discovered, are the most abundant peptides in the native plant O. affinis, and have dissimilar solution behaviors.In this study we employed analytical ultracentrifugation techniques, where absorbance (for low concentrations) and interference optics (for high concentrations) were used to access a broad range of protein concentrations for the characterization of these cyclotides and their oligomers. Analytical ultracentrifugation provides important information about the solution behavior of biomolecules, including the overall size and shape of the molecules and their propensity to self-associate. We utilized sedimentation velocity experiments to resolve the nature of the aggregation behavior employing a newly applied method for determining the continuous size distribution of polydisperse macromolecules in solution (13.Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar, 14.Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1096-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). We also characterized the hydrodynamic properties of these cyclotides, including the sedimentation coefficient (s), the translational diffusion coefficient (D), as well as molecular mass and shape in solution. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed to confirm the identities of the oligomeric species that were detected from the sedimentation velocity experiments, as well as to ascertain the reversibility and determine association constants of the self-association reactions.Based on the NMR structure coordinates of kalata B1 and kalata B2, a comparison of the protein surface residues was made. Special attention was given to residues that affect the properties of those protein surfaces that may play a role in oligomerization (15.Ofran Y. Rost B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Analysis of the structures led us to propose locations of putative self-interaction sites that would explain the solution behavior of these fascinating circular proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSample Preparation—The limiting solubility of a freshly prepared solution of kalata B2 in buffer is ∼6.5 mg/ml. This solution was stable over a 2-week period during which the analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were carried out at 20 °C. However, on storage at low temperature over time the solution becomes colloidal, with some precipitation occurring. By contrast, kalata B1 solutions appear to be less susceptible to precipitation. All sedimentation experiments were done with freshly prepared solutions.Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium and velocity experiments were carried out using an Optima XL-A/XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA), equipped with both absorbance and interference optical detection systems, using a Beckman An-60 Ti rotor with cells containing sapphire windows, and titanium double-sector centerpieces (pathlength 1.2 cm) (Nanolytics GmbH, Dallgow, Germany). The value of the radial distance of the bottom of the cell is between 7.13 and 7.15 cm (not stretched). Kalata B1 and kalata B2 were isolated from the aerial parts of O. affinis as described previously (1.Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) and purified by repeated reverse phase HPLC. Prior to centrifugation, the peptides were either dissolved in or dialyzed into 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm (5875 m-1 cm-1), partial specific volumes (0.702 liters/g), and molecular masses for both kalata B1 and B2 (2,892 and 2,955 Da, respectively) were calculated based on its amino acid composition using the program Sednterp (16.Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 90-125Google Scholar). In experiments using interference optics, 3.33 fringes were taken as equal to 1 mg/ml protein.Sedimentation Velocity—For sedimentation velocity experiments, samples (340 μl, concentrations between 0.5 and 6.5 mg/ml) and reference solutions (350 μl) were loaded into cells. The rotor temperature was equilibrated at 20 °C in the vacuum chamber for 1–2 h prior to the start of the run. Experiments were conducted at 20 °C and rotor speeds of 60,000 rpm. Interference scans were collected at time intervals of 1 min. Data were analyzed with the software Sedfit Version 8.52, and errors reported are from replicate experiments.Continuous Size Distribution Analysis—The continuous size distribution analysis of the sedimentation velocity data of the kalata proteins was performed with Sedfit (Version 8.52). In this analysis a differential sedimentation coefficient distribution c(s) that deconvolutes diffusion effects, based on the direct boundary modeling with distributions of Lamm equation solutions (13.Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar) is determined. A sedimentation coefficient distribution c(s) can be defined as in Equation 1, a(r,t)=∫c(s)χ(s,D(s),r,t)ds+ε(Eq. 1) with the measured absorbance or interference profiles a(r,t) denoting the observed sedimentation data, c(s) the concentration of species with sedimentation coefficients between s and s + ds, χ(s,D,r,t) the solution of the Lamm equation described above (17.Lamm O. Ark. Mat. Astr. Fys. 1929; 21: 1-4Google Scholar) and ϵ the noise components. The Lamm equation was solved by finite element methods on a static or moving frame of reference (18.Claverie J.M.

For each species, the diffusion coefficient D(s) was estimated as a function of the sedimentation s based on the known partial specific volume of the protein, and on an estimated anhydrous frictional ratio (f/fo) (14.Schuck P.

Biopolymers. 1976; 15: 843-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), combined with local weight-average sedimentation coefficients and gradient average diffusion coefficients (20.Cox D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 129: 106-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and a two-step propagation scheme as described by Schuck (19.Schuck P. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1503-1512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In modeling the experimental data the association constants and species sedimentation coefficients were treated as floating parameters.Sedimentation Equilibrium—For the sedimentation equilibrium experiments the cells were filled with 130–150 μl of sample at loading concentrations between 1.0–6.5 mg/ml and reference (140–160 μl) solutions. Sedimentation equilibrium was attained at 24 h at a rotor temperature of 20 °C, and at rotor speeds of 40,000, 45,000, 50,000, and 60,000 rpm respectively. Interferometric patterns were recorded with only water in the cell at appropriate speeds and used for correcting for radial-dependent fluctuation in Rayleigh response across the cell (21.Ansevin A.T. Roark D.E. Yphantis D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 237-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Data analysis was performed by global analysis of 9 datasets obtained at different loading concentrations and rotor speeds using XLA/XL-I Data Analysis Software Version 4.0 (Beckman Instruments, Inc. Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) for fitting the self-association models. Estimates of the weight-average molar masses (Mr) were obtained from the least-squares fits that were based on the Boltzmann distributions of ideal species in the centrifugal field as shown in Equation 2, S(r)=S(r0)exp[σ(r2-r02)]+E(Eq. 2) where S(r) is the experimentally observed concentration signal in absorbance or fringes at radius r, S(r0) the concentration signal at the reference radius r0, σ = Mr(1 - νρ)(ω2/2RT) (where Mr is the weight-average molar mass of the monomer, ν the partial specific volume of the solute, ρ the solvent density, ω the rotor angular velocity, R the gas constant, and T the temperature in Kelvin) and E the baseline offset, and models found in the data analysis software involving multiple species (22.Laue T.M.

One possible explanation would be an increased propensity of kalata B2 to aggregate, but it was not possible to determine this from the NMR data. Analytical ultracentrifugation techniques were therefore employed to compare the hydrodynamic properties and resolve the oligomeric structures of kalata B1 and kalata B2. This was achieved by fitting the sedimentation velocity data to a continuous size distribution (sedimentation coefficient and molar mass), noninteracting discrete species and rapid monomer-tetramer-octamer self-association models. In addition, sedimentation equilibrium data over a wide range of solution conditions were fitted to non-interacting discrete species model, as well as a number of self-association models.Sedimentation Velocity—The sedimentation velocity experiments for kalata B1 and kalata B2 were conducted at a concentration of 5.0 mg/ml. The data, obtained at time intervals of 1 min (Fig. 1), show an excellent fit to a continuous size distribution model (Equation 1). The best-fit sedimentation profiles shown in panel A are of very high quality (r.m.s.d. = 0.018, which represents a fit with a relative error of approx. 0.1%), as reflected in the small, randomly distributed residuals and virtually no systematic deviation visible in the residuals bitmap (Fig. 1, B and C). The resulting continuous size distribution profiles, c(s) (sedimentation coefficient) (Fig. 1D), show the presence of a single monomeric species in solution with a sedimentation coefficient (s20) of 0.75 S, a diffusion coefficient (D20) of 1.92 × 10-6 cm2/s, and a molar mass (M) of 3252 Da. The weight-average frictional ratio (f/fo) was optimized by least-squares regression and converged to a best-fit value of 1.15. Similar values were also obtained from experiments at other initial protein concentrations (1.25 and 2.5 mg/ml) as summarized in Table I. The presence of up to 90% monomer was evident, even at millimolar concentrations. The molar mass determined by this analysis is close to the known molecular mass of kalata B1 (2892 Da), based on its amino acid composition, and verified by mass spectrometry.Table IBest-fit values and estimates of the continuous size distribution analysis of kalata B1 and kalata B2SampleConcentrationf/f oaBest-fit weight-average anhydrous frictional ratio (f/fo)s20bSedimentation coefficient taken from the ordinate maximum of each peak in the best-fit c(s) distribution (Fig. 3) (Svedberg)M cMolar mass values taken from the ordinate maximum of each peak in the best-fit c(M) distribution (13, 14)D20dDiffusion coefficient calculated using the best-fit values for sedimentation coefficient, frictional ratio and molar massmg/ml× 10-6 cm2/sKalata B11.21.150.7331461.942.51.150.7230871.945.01.150.7532521.92Kalata B20.51.150.7028952.001.01.150.7331491.941.65105751.302.01.150.7532731.911.82122691.245.01.150.7030541.911.91138101.152.60221080.986.51.180.6728571.972.00147521.132.76238910.96a Best-fit weight-average anhydrous frictional ratio (f/fo)b Sedimentation coefficient taken from the ordinate maximum of each peak in the best-fit c(s) distribution (Fig. 3)c Molar mass values taken from the ordinate maximum of each peak in the best-fit c(M) distribution (13.Schuck P.

A single best-fit weight-average frictional ratio for all species at different concentrations was extracted from the data by virtue of the criterion of the quality of the fit. The results of the analysis are also summarized in Table I. At a loading protein concentration of 5 mg/ml, Fig. 2 reveals the presence of three major species, with sedimentation coefficients of ∼0.70 (30% of the total), 1.91 (42%), and 2.60 S (25%). These s20 values correspond to molar masses of 3,054, 13,810, and 22,108 Da. It thus appears that the solution is a mixture of monomers, with tetramers and octomers. The oligomers appear to be very stable, as confirmed by similar size distribution measurements made 2 weeks apart. The mass of the 13,810 Da species (4.67 times the monomer molar mass) could be attributed to either a tetramer or a pentamer. Additional analysis of the sedimentation velocity and equilibrium data suggests that this species is most likely a tetramer and that the 22,108 Da species is an octamer (see below).Fig. 2Continuous size distribution analysis of sedimentation velocity data of kalata B2.Panel A, fringe displacements are plotted versus position from the center of rotation at time intervals of 2 min. The cell bottom value is between 7.13 and 7.15 cm (not stretched). A total of 180 scans were used in the analysis. For clarity every 4th scan is shown.

At low concentration kalata B2 (0.5 mg/ml, panel A) is present mainly as a single monomeric species in solution with an s20 of 0.70 S, a diffusion coefficient (D20) of 2.0 × 10-6 cm2/s, and an apparent molar mass of 2,895 Da. The apparent molar mass value is consistent with that deduced from its amino acid composition (2,955 Da), and experimentally verified by mass spectrometry. When the concentration is increased to 2 mg/ml (panel B), a species of a molecular mass that corresponds to a tetramer (12,269 Da), corresponding to ∼24% of the total, also appears in solution. At 6.5 mg/ml (Fig. 3, panel C) a third aggregate, in addition to the monomer (∼19%) and the putative tetramer (∼47%), corresponding to an approximate molar mass of an octamer of 23,891 Da (27%) becomes apparent.Fig. 3Comparison of the continuous size distribution analysis of kalata B2 at three different loading concentrations.Panels A–C, calculated c(s) is plotted versus sedimentation coefficient (s).

For this fit, the respective values obtained for s20 from fits to the continuous size distribution model (Table I), and association constants from fits of the sedimentation equilibrium data to a monomer-tetrameroctamer model (see below), were used as starting values. For the monomer, tetramer, and octamer, respectively, the calculated best-fit sedimentation profiles converge to s20 values of 0.7, 1.6 and 2.6 S, with association constant values of K1,4 = 8 × 107m-3 (0.006 in fringe units) and K1,8 = 4 × 1015m-7 (1 × 10-6 in fringe units). The fit is good (r.m.s.d. of 0.04, which represents a fit with a relative error of 0.23%) with randomly distributed residuals, and only minor systematic deviation visible in the residuals of the bitmap (Fig. 4, B and C).Fig. 4Sedimentation velocity data of kalata B2 compared with sedimentation profiles of a rapid monomer-tetramer-octamer self-association model.Panel A, sedimentation of kalata B2 as shown in Fig. 2 (open circles), and calculated best-fit sedimentation profiles of the rapid monomer-tetramer-octamer self-association model (solid lines), which converged to s20 values of 0.70, 1.6, and 2.6 S for the monomer, tetramer, and octamer, respectively. The association constants were determined as K1,4 = 1.4 × 109m-3 (0.006 fringe units) and K1,8 = 1.0 × 1021m-7 (1.0 × 10-6 fringe units). The r.m.s.d of the global fit is 0.04.

https://openalex.org/W2061716285,"The high number of quaternary structures observed for lectins highlights the important role of these oligomeric assemblies during carbohydrate recognition events. Although a large diversity in the mode of association of lectin subunits is frequently observed, the oligomeric assemblies of plant lectins display small variations within a single family. The crystal structure of the mannose-binding jacalin-related lectin from Calystegia sepium (Calsepa) has been determined at 1.37-Å resolution. Calsepa exhibits the same β-prism fold as identified previously for other members of the family, but the shape and the hydrophobic character of its carbohydrate-binding site is unlike that of other members, consistent with surface plasmon resonance analysis showing a preference for methylated sugars. Calsepa reveals a novel dimeric assembly markedly dissimilar to those described earlier for Heltuba and jacalin but mimics the canonical 12-stranded β-sandwich dimer found in legume lectins. The present structure exemplifies the adaptability of the β-prism building block in the evolution of plant lectins and highlights the biological role of these quaternary structures for carbohydrate recognition."

Previous studies have demonstrated that HHV8 vFLIP K13 interacts with several cellular signaling proteins involved in NF-κB activation, such as receptor-interacting protein, NF-κB-inducing kinase, IκB kinase (IKK) 1, IKK2, and NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO). In this report we have used cell lines deficient in the above proteins to investigate the mechanism of NF-κB activation via HHV8 vFLIP K13. We demonstrate that receptor-interacting protein and NF-κB-inducing kinase are dispensable for vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB DNA binding and transcriptional activation. On the other hand, vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity is significantly reduced, although not absent, in cells deficient in IKK1, IKK2, and NEMO. Furthermore, vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity is only weakly present in IKK1-deficient cells and almost completely absent in those deficient in IKK2 and NEMO. HHV8 vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB activation in IKK1- and IKK2-deficient fibroblasts could be rescued by wild type but not by the kinase-inactive mutants of IKK1 and IKK2, respectively. Consistent with the above results, vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB activation could be effectively blocked by chemical inhibitors of the kinase activity of IKK1 and IKK2. Thus, a cooperative interaction of all three subunits of the IKK complex is required for maximal NF-κB activation via HHV8 vFLIP K13.

Plasmids and Cell Lines—Plasmids containing IKK1, IKK1 kinase mutant, IKK2, IKK2 kinase mutant, and pcDNA3-K13-FLAG have been described previously (10Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Wild type, IKK1-/-, IKK2-/-, and NEMO-/- murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were obtained from Drs. Inder Verma and Richard Gaynor. Wild type and NIK-/- MEFs have been described previously (12Yin L. Wu L. Wesche H. Arthur C.D. White J.M. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 2162-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and were obtained from Dr. Robert Schreiber. These cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Wild type and RIP-deficient Jurkat cells were obtained from Dr. Brian Seed and were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (13Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Both of these media were supplemented with an antibiotic-actinomycotic solution (Invitrogen) containing 10 IU/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Cells from exponentially growing cultures were used for all of the experiments. A retrovirus construct containing C-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged HHV8 vFLIP K13 was generated in MSCV neo-based retroviral vector. Amphotropic and ecotropic viruses were generated and used for infection as described previously (11Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The cells were selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen). Reagents—12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, phenylarsine oxide, and As2O3 were purchased from Sigma. MG132 and lactacystin were purchased from Calbiochem and Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), respectively. Western Blot—Western blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (11Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Primary antibody dilutions used in these experiments were FLAG (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA; sc-807, 1:5000) and actin (Santa Cruz; sc-1616, 1:5000), Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed according to previously described procedures (11Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Antibodies used for supershift studies, p50, p52, p65, RelB, and c-Rel, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Gel Quantitation—Quantitative analysis of the blots was performed using the NIH Image program (developed at the United States National Institutes of Health and available at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Luciferase Reporter Assays—The NF-κB reporter assay was performed essentially as described previously (14Sinha S.K. Zachariah S. Quinones H.I. Shindo M. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44953-44961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, MEF cells were transfected in duplicate using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in a 24-well plate with the various test plasmids along with an NF-κB/luciferase reporter construct (75 ng/well) and a Renilla luciferase reporter construct (phRG-TK; Promega, Madison, WI). For Lipofect-AMINE 2000 transfection in Jurkat cells, the cells were treated with phytohemagglutinin (1.0 μg/ml) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (50 ng/ml) after 4 h of transfection to enhance the cytomegalovirus promoter activity. The cells were lysed 24-30 h later, and extracts were used for the measurement of firefly and Renilla luciferase activities. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized relative to the Renilla luciferase activity to control for the difference in the transfection efficiency. Role of RIP in HHV8 vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB Activation— RIP is a serine-threonine protein kinase, which has been shown to play an essential role in NF-κB activation via TNF receptor 1 (13Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 15Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that RIP and vFLIP K13 physically interact with each other upon transient transfection in 293T cells (10Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). More recently, we demonstrated that endogenous RIP co-immunoprecipitates with vFLIP K13 from the lysates of H460 cells expressing the latter protein in a stable fashion (11Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To study the role of RIP in HHV8 vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB activation, we took advantage of a mutant clone of Jurkat cells deficient in this protein (13Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). We used retrovirally mediated gene transfer to generate polyclonal populations of wild type and RIP-deficient Jurkat cells expressing an empty vector or FLAG-tagged vFLIP K13. Western blot analysis confirmed equivalent expression of the vFLIP K13 in the wild type and RIP-deficient Jurkat cells (Fig. 1A). We subsequently used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to examine the ability of vFLIP K13 to activate the NF-κB pathway in the two cell lines. Expression of vFLIP K13 in the wild type Jurkat cells was found to lead to constitutive NF-κB activation as measured by the gel shift assay, which was absent in the empty vector-infected cells (Fig. 1B). However, vFLIP K13 could effectively induce NF-κB DNA binding activity in the RIP-deficient cells as well, thereby suggesting that RIP is not involved in this process (Fig. 1B). To test the possibility that the observed NF-κB complexes in RIP-deficient cells are transcriptionally active, we transiently transfected an empty vector or a vFLIP K13-expressing vector in wild type and RIP-deficient Jurkat cells and measured NF-κB transcriptional activation using an NF-κB luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 1C, transient transfection of vFLIP K13 in wild type Jurkat cells led to significant NF-κB activation as compared with the empty vector transfected cells. Consistent with the gel shift assay, transient transfection of vFLIP K13 led to an equivalent increase in NF-κB activation as compared with control vector in RIP-deficient cells as well. Collectively, the above results argue against the involvement of RIP in K13-induced NF-κB DNA binding or transcriptional activities. Role of NIK in HHV8 vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB Activation—We have previously demonstrated that HHV8 vFLIP K13 can co-immunoprecipitate with NIK when both of these proteins are overexpressed in 293T cells (10Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Involvement of NIK in vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB activation was also supported by the ability of dominant-negative mutants of NIK to block vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB activation in a luciferase reporter assay (10Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, the above conclusions were based on assays involving transient transfection of different plasmids and, as such, could have been influenced by the artifacts introduced by overexpressed proteins. Furthermore, the role of NIK in NF-κB activation is enigmatic. For example, although a dominant-negative mutant of NIK can block NF-κB activation via TNF receptor 1, subsequent studies using NIK -/- MEF cells have argued against the involvement of this kinase in TNF receptor 1-induced NF-κB. To re-examine the involvement of NIK in vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB activation in a more physiological setting, we took advantage of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells from NIK-/- animals. As we did earlier, we used retrovirally mediated gene transfer to generate polyclonal populations of wild type and NIK-deficient cells expressing an empty vector or FLAG-tagged vFLIP K13 and confirmed equivalent expression of vFLIP K13 protein using Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). Subsequently, we used gel shift and luciferase reporter assays to examine the status of the NF-κB pathway in the various cellular populations. As shown in Fig. 2 (B and C), we found near equivalent activation of the NF-κB pathway in vFLIP K13-expressing wild type and NIK-/- MEFs using the gel shift and luciferase reporter assays, thereby arguing against the involvement of NIK in vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB DNA binding or transcriptional activation. Role of IKKs in HHV8 vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB Activation—We have previously reported that vFLIP K13 physically associates with a ∼700-kDa IKK signalsome complex consisting of IKK1, IKK2, and NEMO. To investigate whether one or all of the subunits of the IKK complex are required for vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB, we took advantage of mouse embryo fibroblast cells deficient in IKK1, IKK2, and NEMO. As we did earlier, we generated stable clones of the above cells expressing an empty vector or vFLIP K13 and confirmed the expression of the K13 protein by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A). To determine the effect of K13 expression on the activation of the NF-κB pathway, we initially performed a gel mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig. 3B, this assay demonstrated increased NF-κB DNA binding activity in the vFLIP K13-expressing wild type MEFs, which was absent in the vector-expressing cells. However, unlike the situation with the RIP- and NIK-deficient cells, significantly reduced NF-κB DNA binding activity was observed in vFLIP K13-expressing IKK1-, IKK2-, and NEMO-deficient MEFs (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, some residual NF-κB DNA binding activity was observed in K13-expressing IKK1-, IKK2-, and NEMO-deficient cells, suggesting that none of these subunits is absolutely essential for K13-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 3, B and C). A gel supershift assay revealed that similar to the wild type MEFs, the residual NF-κB complexes present in the vFLIP K13-expressing IKK1-/-, IKK2-/-, or NEMO-/- MEFs were primarily composed of p65 and p50 subunits (Fig. 3C). The above results were further supported by an NF-κB-based luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 3D, transient transfection of vFLIP K13 in the wild type MEF cells led to significant activation of the NF-κB reporter activity, which was markedly reduced in the IKK1-deficient cells and nearly completely absent in IKK2- and NEMO-deficient cells. Collectively, the above results suggest that optimal NF-κB activation by vFLIP K13 requires the activities of all the three subunits of the IKK complex. Role of the Kinase Activities of IKK1 and IKK2 in vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB Activation—After confirming the involvement of the catalytic subunits of the IKK complex in vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB activation, we sought to determine the requirement of their kinase activities in the above process. For this purpose, IKK1- or IKK2-deficient MEFs were transiently transfected with an empty vector or vFLIP K13 along with either wild type or kinase-inactive mutants of IKK1 or IKK2, and NF-κB activation was measured using the luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, vFLIP K13 could activate NF-κB in the IKK1-deficient MEFs when co-expressed with the wild type IKK1 but not with the kinase-inactive IKK1. Similarly, vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB activation in the IKK2-deficient MEFs could be partially restored upon co-transfection of the wild type IKK2 but not its kinase-inactive mutant (Fig. 4B). The lack of complete complementation of K13-induced NF-κB activity by transfection of wild type IKK2 in IKK2-deficient cells is probably due to failure to faithfully reproduce the stoichiometry of various IKK subunits present in the wild type cells. Inhibitors of the Kinase Activity of the IKK Complex Block vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB Activation—We next sought to determine whether the inhibitors of the kinase activity of the IKK complex might be used to inhibit vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB activation. For this purpose, we generated a subclone of the HEK293 cell line, designated 293NFκB-Luc, with stable expression of an NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter construct. Subsequently, we used retrovirally mediated gene transfer to generate polyclonal derivatives of this subclone with stable expression of either an empty vector or vFLIP K13 (Fig. 5A). Consistent with its ability to activate the NF-κB pathway, vFLIP K13-expressing 293NF-κB-Luc cells demonstrated 50-fold higher levels of luciferase activity as compared with empty vector-expressing cells (Fig. 5B). We next used the vector- and vFLIP K13-expressing 293NF-κB-Luc cells to study the effect of inhibitors of the IKK complex on K13-induced NF-κB activation. Recent studies suggest that aspirin, As2O3, arsenite, and phenylarsine oxide are potent inhibitors of the kinase activities of the IKK complex (16Roussel R.R. Barchowsky A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Kapahi P. Takahashi T. Natoli G. Adams S.R. Chen Y. Tsien R.Y. Karin M. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 5C, treatment of 293NF-κB-Luc vFLIP K13 cells with the above chemicals led to significant inhibition of the luciferase reporter activity, which was comparable in magnitude with that achieved with lactacystin and MG132, two proteasome inhibitors that are known to block NF-κB activation via diverse pathways by blocking IκB degradation. Taken together, the above results support the hypothesis that vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB activation requires the kinase activity of the IKK complex. Furthermore, these results suggest that selective inhibitors of the IKK kinase activity might have a role in the treatment of disorders caused by abnormal activation of the NF-κB pathway by vFLIP K13. Based on its sequence homology to the prodomain of caspase 8, vFLIP K13 was believed to function mainly as an inhibitor of caspase 8 recruitment and activation during death receptor signaling (7Thome M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Fickenscher H. Meinl E. Neipel F. Mattmann C. Burns K. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Scaffidi C. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 386: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). However, we subsequently demonstrated that vFLIP K13 could activate the NF-κB pathway (10Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 11Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), thereby extending the range of its biological activities. NF-κB activation by vFLIP K13 has been recently confirmed by two independent groups (20Field N. Low W. Daniels M. Howell S. Daviet L. Boshoff C. Collins M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3721-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 21An J. Sun Y. Sun R. Rettig M.B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3371-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition to vFLIP K13, HHV8 is known to encode for two other proteins with potential for NF-κB activation: vGPCR (viral G protein-coupled receptor) and K1 (22Cannon M. Philpott N.J. Cesarman E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Pati S. Foulke Jr., J.S. Barabitskaya O. Kim J. Nair B.C. Hone D. Smart J. Feldman R.A. Reitz M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5759-5773Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, among these proteins, only vFLIP K13 is expressed in latently infected primary effusion lymphoma cell lines, making it a prime candidate for the persistent NF-κB activation present in the HHV8-infected primary effusion lymphoma cell lines (11Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 24Sun R. Lin S.F. Staskus K. Gradoville L. Grogan E. Haase A. Miller G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2232-2242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the presence of two death effector domains in vFLIP K13, a likely model for its NF-κB inducing ability could have involved its interaction with the death effector domain-containing adaptor protein FADD and subsequent reverse signaling via the death receptors. However, we have previously demonstrated the ability of vFLIP K13 to activate the NF-κB pathway in FADD-deficient MEF cells, thereby arguing against this possibility (10Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Another potential mediator of vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB activation is RIP, which is known to play a key role in NF-κB activation via TNF receptor 1 (13Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 15Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) and is known to physically interacts with vFLIP K13 (10Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, our results with RIP-deficient Jurkat cells argue against this possibility and suggest that vFLIP K13 induces NF-κB activation by interacting with the downstream kinases of this pathway. NIK is a serine threonine kinase of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway that was suspected to play a role in vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB activation based on the ability of dominant-negative mutants of N1K to block vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB in a luciferase reporter assay (10Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In addition, NIK could co-immunoprecipitate with vFLIP K13 upon transient transfection in 293T cells (10Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, the role of NIK in canonical NF-κB activation is controversial. For example, although a dominant-negative mutant of NIK could block NF-κB activation via TNFα and interleukin-1, recent studies found no difference in NF-κB DNA binding or transcriptional activities between wild type and NIK-deficient MEFs upon stimulation by these cytokines (25Smith C. Andreakos E. Crawley J.B. Brennan F.M. Feldmann M. Foxwell B.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5895-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently, NIK was found to play a role in lymphotoxin β receptor- (12Yin L. Wu L. Wesche H. Arthur C.D. White J.M. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D.

Wang H. Siebenlist U. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In the present study we have demonstrated equivalent NF-κB DNA binding and transcriptional activities in vFLIP K13-expressing wild type and NIK-deficient MEFs, which argue against a role for NIK in vFLIP K13-induced activation of the canonical NF-κB. However, it remains to be seen whether vFLIP K13 is also capable of activating the noncanonical pathway of NF-κB activation and the role of NIK in this process. Studies are currently underway to address this question. Biochemical and genetic characterization of inducible NF-κB activation has led to the identification of a multi-subunit IKK complex consisting of two catalytic subunits, IKK1/IKKα and IKK2/IKKβ, respectively, and a regulatory subunit, NEMO/IKKγ (32Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2442) Google Scholar, 33Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3280) Google Scholar). Subsequent gene knock-out studies supported a role for IKK2/IKKβ and NEMO/IKKγ in proinflammatory cytokines-induced NF-κB activation (34Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M.

Nallainathan D. Potter J. Elia A.J. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 854-862PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a majority of the published studies argue against a major role of IKK1 in cytokine-induced activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway (35Li Q. Estepa G. Memet S. Israel A. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1729-1733PubMed Google Scholar, 40Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S.

Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The role of the IKK complex in vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB activation has been suspected based on our prior study, which demonstrated that vFLIP K13 could physically associate with a 700-kDa IKK signalsome complex containing IKK1, IKK2, and NEMO/IKKγ (11Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This study also demonstrated that vFLIP K13 was incapable of NF-κB activation in a NEMO-deficient mouse pre-B cell lymphoma cell line, thereby demonstrating an essential role for NEMO in this process (11Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that both the catalytic subunits of the IKK complex, i.e. IKK1 and IKK2, also contribute to vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB DNA binding and transcriptional activities. Thus, all three subunits of the IKK complex are required for maximal NF-κB activation via vFLIP K13. In the current study we have noted some residual NF-κB DNA binding activity in vFLIP K13-expressing IKK1-, IKK2-, and NEMO-deficient MEF cells. The results with IKK1-deficient cells were expected because a majority of published studies have found significant cytokine-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity in IKK1-deficient cells (35Li Q. Estepa G. Memet S. Israel A. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1729-1733PubMed Google Scholar, 40Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S.

Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there is conflicting data about the presence of residual cytokine-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity in IKK2-deficient cells, which may be due to the use of different cell types in different studies. Thus, although one study reported a nearly complete absence of interleukin-1 and TNF-α-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity in IKK2-deficient embryonic stem cells (36Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), two studies reported significant residual NF-κB DNA binding activity in IKK2-deficient MEFs (36Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 38Schmidt-Supprian M. Bloch W. Courtois G. Addicks K. Israel A. Rajewsky K. Pasparakis M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 981-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Finally, the presence of residual NF-κB DNA binding activity in K13-expressing NEMO-deficient MEFs is surprising because it has been previously reported that cytokine-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity is completely lacking in these cells (37Makris C.

Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the difference in the two results reflects the fact that vFLIP K13 induces NF-κB DNA binding activity via a mechanism distinct from cytokines. Alternatively, it is also possible that vFLIP K13 induces NF-κB DNA binding via two pathways, one involving NEMO (and IKK2) and the other involving IKK1, and full NF-κB DNA binding activity requires synergistic interaction between these two pathways. In this regard, it is pertinent to note that unlike our results with MEFs in the current study, we have previously observed a complete lack of NF-κB DNA binding activity in 1.3E2 cells, a NEMO-deficient subclone of 70Z/3 mouse pre-B cell lymphoma cell line (11Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for the difference in the results between the two studies may lie in the absence of IKK1-induced NF-κB binding activity in the 1.3E2 cells. It is also conceivable that the residual NF-κB DNA binding activity seen in the vFLIP K13-expressing IKK1-/-, IKK2-/-, and NEMO-/- cells reflects the involvement of an as yet unidentified signaling pathway. Finally, as discussed above, K13 is known to make a multisubunit signalsome complex with IKK1, IKK2, and NEMO/IKKγ (11Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It is possible that K13 is able to induce the formation of a partial IKK complex under the conditions when one or the other IKK subunit is missing. The residual NF-κB DNA binding activity observed in the IKK1-, IKK2-, and NEMO-deficient cells in the current study could simply reflect the activity of such a partial IKK complex. Unlike NF-κB DNA binding activity, NF-κB transcriptional activity was only weakly present in IKK1-deficient cells and was absent in IKK2 and NEMO-deficient cells. The lack of K13-induced NF-κB activation in IKK2- and NEMO-deficient cells is consistent with previous studies demonstrating the requirement for these proteins in TNF-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity (34Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 35Li Q. Estepa G. Memet S. Israel A. Verma I.M.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 854-862PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the results with IKK1-deficient cells were somewhat unexpected because earlier studies have suggested a lack of role for this kinase in transcriptional activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway (35Li Q. Estepa G. Memet S. Israel A. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1729-1733PubMed Google Scholar, 40Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S.

Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). However, two recent studies, which were published while this manuscript was in preparation, demonstrated that IKK1 plays an important role in cytokine-induced NF-κB transcriptional activation via histone H3 phosphorylation (43Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 44Anest V. Hanson J.L. Cogswell P.C. Steinbrecher K.A. Strahl B.D. Baldwin A.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that IKK1-mediated histone H3 phosphorylation also contributes to K13-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity. Abnormal activation of the NF-κB pathway has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of several human malignancies, and several inhibitors of this pathway are in clinical use or in various stages of development (45Garg A. Aggarwal B.B. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1053-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 46Zingarelli B. Sheehan M. Wong H.R. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 31: S105-S111Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A common mechanism of action of the NF-κB inhibitors currently in clinical development is to block the degradation of IκBα by inhibiting the activity of proteasome (47Cory A.H. Cory J.G. Anticancer Res. 2002; 22: 3805-3809PubMed Google Scholar, 48Mitsiades N. Mitsiades C.S. Richardson P.G. Poulaki V. Tai Y.T. Chauhan D. Fanourakis G. Gu X. Bailey C. Joseph M. Libermann T.A. Schlossman R. Munshi N.C. Hideshima T. Anderson K.C. Blood. 2003; 101: 2377-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). However, proteasome is required for breakdown of several regulatory proteins, which may contribute to the side effects of such inhibitors. In this regard, our result suggesting a major role for IKK1 in vFLIP K13-induced constitutive NF-κB activation presents potential opportunities for the development of molecularly targeted drugs for the treatment of HHV8-associated malignancies. However, future development of this approach may depend on further analysis of the physiological role played by IKK1 and the consequences of its inhibition on normal cellular physiology.

https://openalex.org/W2072192901,"We report the cloning and characterization of a novel p53 and DNA damage-regulated gene (PDRG). The human and mouse PDRG sequences are highly homologous and contain open reading frames of 133 amino acids each with molecular masses of 15.5 and 15.3 kDa, respectively. PDRG codes for a novel protein that does not show similarity to any known protein in the databases. Human PDRG is predominantly expressed in normal testis and exhibits reduced but detectable expression in other organs. GFP-tagged PDRG was predominantly detected as aggregates that appeared to reside in a distinct subcellular compartment. PDRG mRNA was upregulated by ultraviolet radiation (UV) but downregulated by tumor suppressor p53. UV is known to transcriptionally upregulate the expression of certain genes by activating the transcription factor Oct-1, while p53 has been reported to suppress transcription of certain genes by directly binding to a novel head-to-tail response element. Cloning and sequence analysis of PDRG promoter revealed the presence of Oct-1-binding element and a putative head-to-tail-type p53-binding site. Indeed, UV as well as exogenous Oct-1 independently increased PDRG promoter activity, suggesting that UV could mediate PDRG upregulation via Oct-1. Exogenous wild-type p53 was found to downregulate the PDRG promoter activity indicating that wild-type p53 transcriptionally suppresses the expression of PDRG and may mediate its effect via the putative head-to-tail response element. Furthermore, stable expression of exogenous PDRG was found to decrease the clonogenic survival after UV irradiation, which highlights the significance of PDRG in facilitating UV-induced killing."

To identify potential genes regulated by the Pax2 protein, we screened embryonic kidney cells transformed with Pax2-expressing retroviruses for genes activated in response to Pax2 expression. In this system, the gene encoding the secreted frizzled related protein, Sfrp2, was strongly activated in all Pax2b-expressing cells. This activation of Sfrp2 expression correlated with changes in chromatin structure at the Sfrp2 locus, particularly in and around regions of Pax2 binding. Although the amount of Pax2-dependent transactivation was low in transient assays, the data suggests that local alterations of chromatin structure by Pax proteins can greatly enhance expression when presented in the right cellular context.

The vertebrate Pax genes encode transcription factors that specify correct embryonic patterning and cellular differentiation in a broad array of structures (1Chi N. Epstein J.A. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The Pax2 gene is essential for early kidney development, optic stalk fusion, and ear development in both mouse (2Torres M. Gomez-Pardo E. Dressler G.R. Gruss P. Development. 1995; 121: 4057-4065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and man (3Sanyanusin P. McNoe L.A. Sullivan M.J. Weaver R.G. Eccles M.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2183-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The role of Pax2 has been studied extensively in the developing kidney, where it regulates the earliest phase of epithelial cell morphogenesis within the intermediate mesoderm. The Pax2, Pax8, and lim1 transcription factors mark the intermediate mesoderm and the first epithelium, the nephric duct, which is derived from the intermediate mesoderm (4Bouchard M. Souabni A. Mandler M. Neubuser A. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2958-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Pax2 is also found in the metanephric mesenchymal cells adjacent to the posterior nephric duct, where it regulates expression of the gdnf gene to provide a guidance cue for the ureteric bud diverticulum as it invades the mesenchyme (5Brophy P.D. Ostrom L. Lang K.M. Dressler G.R. Development. 2001; 128: 4747-4756PubMed Google Scholar). Within the mesenchyme, Pax2 is required for cells to respond to inductive signals emanating from the invading ureteric bud (5Brophy P.D. Ostrom L. Lang K.M. Dressler G.R. Development. 2001; 128: 4747-4756PubMed Google Scholar). These inductive signals promote changes in cell adhesion of the mesenchyme, epithelial polarization, and tubule formation. The mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition characteristic in the developing nephron requires extensive cell and tissue remodeling. These processes are mediated, in part, by secreted signaling molecules such as Wnts (6Kispert A. Vainio S. McMahon A.P. Development. 1998; 125: 4225-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lescher B.

Pax continues to be expressed during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and in a proliferating population of primitive epithelia until the maturation of the nephron nears completion.

Early in the metanephric mesenchyme, Pax2 can activate the gdnf (5Brophy P.D. Ostrom L. Lang K.M. Dressler G.R. Development. 2001; 128: 4747-4756PubMed Google Scholar) and WT1 (22McConnell M.J.

The Pax2 protein contains a DNA-binding domain, an octapeptide domain with repressor activity, and a transactivation domain that can be phosphorylated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1The abbreviations used are: JNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salineGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.1The abbreviations used are: JNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salineGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

Phosphorylation of the trans-activation domain results in increased Pax2 activation potential, yet the mechanism of activation remains to be characterized. Consistent with Pax2 phosphorylation by JNK, phenotypic analyses with JNK1/JNK2 double-mutant embryos suggest that JNK activity modifies a late function of Pax2 in the developing eye and kidney (26Weston C.R. Wong A. Hall J.P. Goad M.E. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, modification of Pax2 activity by JNK is attenuated by the Groucho 4 protein, which is able to completely suppress Pax2 transactivation ability (27Cai Y. Brophy P.D. Levitan I. Stefani S. Dressler G.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5522-5529Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These lines of investigation suggest multiple functions of Pax2 that may be determined in part by different sets of positively and negatively regulated target genes.Both in the developing kidney and nervous system, Pax2 protein activity plays an essential role in cellular differentiation, cell survival, and tissue remodeling. These events must be mediated by many other proteins, whose activity may be positively or negatively regulated by Pax2. To try and identify potential genes downstream of the Pax2 protein, we developed cell lines from immortalized mouse kidney mesenchyme that were Pax2-negative and introduced the Pax2 protein. These cells were used in a differential screen for genes up-regulated in response to the Pax2 protein. One of the most prominent genes activated in response to Pax2 encodes the secreted frizzled related protein, Sfrp2. The Sfrp proteins can negatively regulate signaling through sequestration of the Wnt ligands in the extra cellular space (7Lescher B. Haenig B. Kispert A. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 440-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28Ladher R.K. Church V.L. Allen S. Robson L. Abdelfattah A. Brown N.A. Hattersley G. Rosen V. Luyten F.P. Dale L. Francis-West P.H.

Sfrp2 is expressed in the early polarized epithelial vesicle, in a subset of Pax2-expressing epithelia. In Pax2-expressing cells, the Sfrp2 locus exhibits changes in DNaseI hypersensitivity and association with the nuclear matrix. These data suggest that Sfrp2 is a target of the Pax2 transcription factor, late in epithelial cell polarization.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Conditionally immortalized E11 mouse metanephric mesenchyme cells, derived from the ImmortoMouse™, were a gift of L. Holzman (University of Michigan). The cell lines contain a temperature-sensitive SV40 T-antigen gene under the control of the γ-interferon response element and were cultured at 32 °C with 100 units/ml of γ-interferon in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum plus 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The clonally derived 46m cell line expresses low levels of WT-1 but tested negative for Pax2 expression. Line 46m was subsequently transformed with Pax2b, and Pax2a-expressing retroviruses containing the neomycin resistance gene and clonally derived cell lines were established. These cell lines were examined for Pax2 expression by Western and Northern blotting. Multiple clonal cell lines transformed with the Pax2b-expressing retrovirus were shown to express Pax2 by both Western and Northern analysis. A single clonal line (28Pax2) was utilized for the differential screen.Subtractive Hybridization—The parental cell line 46m and the Pax2b positive clonal line 28Pax2 were expanded, and RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Polyadenylated mRNA was selected by two rounds of oligo-dT selection, and the integrity of the A+ RNA was tested by Northern blotting and hybridization was tested with a β-actin probe. 2 μg of poly-A+ RNA was used to make double-stranded cDNAs from the 46m and 28Pax2 cell lines. The double-stranded cDNAs were used for suppressive subtractive hybridization with the PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech, BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Both a forward subtraction (28Pax2 minus 46m) and a reverse subtraction (46m minus 28Pax2) were performed, and the total subtracted inserts were cloned as a library into the pCR2.1 T/A vector (Clontech). Both the forward- and reverse-subtracted libraries were spotted onto grids, and replica colony lifts were probed with probes corresponding to the total forward- and reverse-subtracted inserts. Individual clones were isolated from the 28Pax2 forward-subtracted library if they hybridized to the 28Pax2 forward-subtracted probe but not to the 46m reverse-subtracted probe. Such positive clones were candidates for genes activated in response to Pax2b and were used as probes for Northern blots of the original RNAs from the panel of Pax2-transformed cell lines.Northern Blotting—Total RNA from cell lines was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lines used for analysis included clone 46m Cells and Pax2 retrovirally transformed cells (designated clones 5, 8, 12, 13, 24, 26, 27, 28). Each 100-mm plate contained 1 × 107 cells. Once RNA was isolated and resuspended in Rnase-free water, an A260 was obtained for each sample to determine yield. An aliquot of 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed in 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane (overnight), and probed with a fragment from the Sfrp2 cDNA. The probe was labeled with [32P]dCTP via the random prime reaction. Blots were pre-hybridized with 5 ml of Rapid-hyb (Amersham Biosciences), and 5 × 106 cpm of the radiolabeled probe was added. After 4 h at 65 °C, blots were washed in 2× SSC, 1% SDS twice, and 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS once at 65 °C each.Protein/DNA Pull-down Assay and Electrophoretic Mobility Shifts— The Pax2-paired domain (Pax2-PD), amino acids 1–170, was fused to a poly-histidine expression vector (pRSET, Invitrogen) and purified by metal affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. The denatured-paired domain protein was dialyzed stepwise in decreasing amounts of urea and finally into Z buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Genomic SFRP2 fragments were isolated from the plasmid backbone and digested with either HpaII or TaqI. Approximately 0.1 mg of the total digests were end-labeled with [32P]dCTP and the Klenow fill-in reaction. The binding reaction contained 10,000 dpm of labeled DNA, 5–10 ng of Pax2-PD protein in 25 μl of Z buffer, 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 1 μg of dIdC in a total volume of 50 μl. As a specific competitor, 100 ng of an H2A double-stranded, unlabeled oligomer (30Phelps D.E. Dressler G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7978-7985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was added to duplicate reactions. Affinity beads were prewashed sequentially with 0.5× Z buffer, 0.5× Z buffer, and 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 0.5× Z buffer. The binding reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, then 20 ml of prewashed nickel-affinity beads (Qiagen) were added, and the reaction was rotated for an additional 30 min. After binding, the beads were washed 3 times with 0.5× Z buffer, and the DNA was eluted in 20 ml of 1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, and 1 mm EDTA at 65 °C for 10 min. The eluted DNA was run on 4% neutral acrylamide gels with total input DNA as a marker.To confirm binding of Pax2 to the candidate fragments, DNA fragments were isolated from a 1.5% agarose gel after digestion with restriction enzymes, subcloned, sequenced, and used for electrophoretic mobility shift experiments, as described. Binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 10 μl for 30 min at room temperature and contained increasing amounts of purified Pax2 PD (1–170 amino acids) protein and 100 ng poly (dI-dC) labeled probe (10,000 dpm). Free DNA and DNA/protein complexes were resolved at room temperature on 4% or 6% neutral polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA at 120 V.Nuclear Matrix Isolation and DNaseI Hypersensitive Site Mapping— Nuclear Matrix isolation was a modified version of that described by (32Vassetzky Y. Hair A. Mechali M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1541-1552PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei from 46m and 28Pax2 cells were isolated according to Phelps and Dressler (30Phelps D.E. Dressler G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7978-7985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and were subsequently digested in digestion buffer (100 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.25 mm spermidine) with 100 μg/ml of Rnase-free DNaseI. After a 3-h incubation at 4 °C, CuCl2 was added to a final concentration of 1 mm; after a 10-min incubation at 4 °C, the nuclear matrix was extracted with an equal volume of 4 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, centrifuged and washed (in 2 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), then centrifuged and digested in 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml protease K. Samples were digested with RNase for 1 h at 37 °C. DNA was phenol chloroform extracted, precipitated with ethanol, and quantified by optical density at 260 nm. Approximately 50 ng of isolated matrix-associated DNA was radio-labeled by the random prime method and used to probe a Southern blot of digested Sfrp2 genomic DNAs.For mapping DNaseI hypersensitive sites, nuclei were resuspended in PBS with 10 mm MgCl2 and aliquoted into equal amounts on ice. After addition of increasing concentrations of Rnase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science), samples were digested for 10 min. at 37 °C and then terminated by the addition of three volumes of DNA extraction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS). Protease-K was added to 0.5 mg/ml, and samples were digested overnight. After extraction with phenol:chloroform (1:1) and ethanol precipitation, 5 mg of DNA were cut with HindIII, run on 0.7% agarose gels, and Southern blotted to Genescreen nylon membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For the Sfrp2 locus, a 300-bp probe corresponding to the 5′ end of the 9-kb HindIII fragment was labeled by random priming.CAT Assays—NIH 3T3 cells were plated at 500,000 cells per 60-mm dish, cultured in DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C, and transfected the following day with FuGENE™ (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's protocol. For each 60-mm dish, 6 μl of FuGENE™ were used per 3 μg of DNA, which contained 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.2 μg of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase for standardization. After a 2-h exposure to the FuGENE™/DNA in DMEM (serum free), DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum was added to double the volume. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were scraped into PBS, spun down, and resuspended in 0.3 ml of 0.25 m Tris (pH 7.6). Cells were lysed with three freeze/thaw cycles. Debris was pelleted, and 50 μl of lysate was assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Equivalent amounts of β-galactosidase units were then used for the acetylation reactions as described (31Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5288) Google Scholar). Spots were cut out of the thin layer chromatography plate, and scintillation was counted. Counts were standardized for background. Each transfection was performed a minimum of three times.RESULTSTo identify potential target genes activated by the Pax2 transcription factor, we developed a panel of immortalized cell lines derived from metanephric mesenchyme of E11 ImmortoMouse™ embryos. The cell lines carried a temperature-sensitive SV40 Tag under the control of a γ-interferon-inducible promoter and were cultured at 32 °C. Individual clonal lines were screened for the expression of Pax2, WT1, and Wnt4 (data not show) by Northern blotting. The cells were fibroblastic in morphology and did not express detectable levels of Pax2. The parental cell line 46m was chosen as it expressed very low levels of the metanephric mesenchyme marker WT1, was still mesenchymal in character, but did not express Pax2 or Sfrp2. Both Pax2b and Pax2a were introduced into the 46m cells by retroviral infection, and clonally derived cell lines were selected with G418 and expanded. Individual cells were assayed for the expression of Pax2a or Pax2b by Western blotting (Fig. 1A).To identify possible Pax2 target genes activated in the Pax2-expressing clones, a suppressive-subtractive hybridization strategy was utilized. Polyadenylated RNA from the parental cells 46m and the Pax2b transformant 28Pax2 were used to make subtracted libraries. The libraries were spotted onto replica grids and screened with probes made from the original forward-(28Pax2 minus 46m) and reverse-(46m minus 28Pax2) subtracted cDNAs. Only clones from the forward-subtracted library that also hybridized with the forward-subtracted probe but not with the reverse probe were analyzed further by Northern blotting to total RNAs from the original panel of Pax2-transformed cell lines. One of the most abundant clones in the forward-subtracted library contained a partial sequence derived from the Sfrp2 gene. Using this sequence tag as a probe, Northern blotting revealed dramatic activation of the Sfrp2 mRNA in mesenchymal-derived cells expressing the Pax2b isoform (Fig. 1B). Strikingly, the parental 46m cell line and cells expressing Pax2a did not show increased levels of Sfrp2 mRNA, whereas all of the Pax2b transformants exhibited increased Sfrp2 mRNA levels, and most of them exhibited it to a very high degree.The mouse Sfrp2 genomic locus was cloned from a BAC library, and the structure of the gene was determined (Fig. 2A). The mRNA is encoded in three exons spanning about 8 kb. To localize potential regulatory regions within the Sfrp2 genomic locus, we utilized DNaseI hypersensitive site mapping using the parental 46m cells and the Pax2-expressing clonal lines 28Pax2 and 8Pax2 (Fig. 2B). Two hypersensitive sites were mapped, one of which was present in all cell lines (site I) and a second that was prominent only in the Pax2-expressing cells (site II). Site II is located just upstream of the presumed transcription start site, based upon available cDNA sequence data.Fig. 2A, schematic of the Sfrp2 genomic locus show three exons (white boxes), the coding region (gray boxes), the position of two DNaseI hypersensitive sites, and the position of the Pax2 binding sites (black boxes). For orientation, the 5′ HindIII (H) site is labeled nucleotide 1. Other restriction sites are: P, PstI; Xb, XbaI; X, XhoI, and B, BamHI. The probe used for hypersensitive site mapping is indicated. B, DNaseI hypersensitive site-mapping experiment using nuclei from 46m, 28Pax2, and 8Pax2 cells. DNA was isolated from nuclei after treatment with increasing amounts of DNaseI. DNA was digested with HindIII and analyzed by Southern blotting using a HindIII-PstI probe corresponding to the 5′ Sfrp2 locus outlined above. Note the appearance of a DNaseI hypersensitive region (site II) in the 28Pax2 and 8Pax2 cells, which maps ∼2.6–2.8 kb downstream from the HindIII site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further examine the ability of Pax2 to bind directly to and regulate the Sfrp2 locus, we screened two overlapping Sfrp2 genomic clones spanning more than 13 kb for Pax2-binding sites by using a novel protein/DNA pull-down assay (Fig. 3A). Total plasmid DNAs from either a 9-kb HindIII or a 12-kB XbaI fragment were digested with frequent cutting restriction endonucleases (HpaII or TaqI) and end-labeled with32P. The DNA mixture was incubated with a recombinant Pax2-paired domain fused to a polyhistidine tag and the protein/DNA complexes were pulled down with Ni-affinity agarose. Unlabeled competitor DNAs from the high affinity Pax2-binding sequence H2A were added to test for specificity. In all cases, the pulled down fragments were competed out with an excess of unlabeled H2A Pax2-binding sequence. The Pax2-paired domain specifically bound strongly to two fragments in the HpaII digests and one fragment in the TaqI digest (Fig. 3). These fragments were subcloned, sequenced, and analyzed further by electrophoretic mobility shift experiments (Fig. 3B). Two fragments mapped within the potential regulatory region upstream of the Sfrp2 translation initiation site. Both fragments bound recombinant Pax2 protein in the region spanning -411 to -210, mapping around the DNaseI hypersensitive site II that is prominent only in the 28Pax2 cells. These data suggest that Pax2 binding results in a change in local chromatin structure that alters the sensitivity of the Sfrp2 locus to DNaseI.Fig. 3Identification of Pax2 binding sites within the Sfrp2 locus.A, DNA/protein pull-down experiments. A 9-kb HindIII or a 12-kb XbaI fragment were digested with the indicated four cutters and end labeled. These fragments had significant overlap (Fig. 1A). After incubation with poly-His-tagged Pax2-paired domain, the DNA/protein complexes were pulled down with Ni-affinity beads, and the DNA was eluted and analyzed on a 4% neutral acrylamide gel. Total input is indicated (DNA); binding reactions were done with (+) or without (-) an excess of a cold Pax2 competitor DNA-binding site. Arrows indicate fragments that were able to bind to the Pax2-paired domain. B, confirmation of Pax2-binding sites by electrophoretic motility shift experiments. Isolated fragments corresponding to the position of the published sequence are as indicated. Increasing amounts (0, 1, 5 μl) of diluted Pax2-PD protein was used. Note shifted species in the fragment -411 to -210 (PBS-A) and +13 to +125 (PNS-B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To address changes in the regulatory region of the Sfrp2 locus, we examined the ability of genomic DNA to associate with the nuclear matrix. Changes in nuclear matrix attachment have been correlated with the activation of specific chromatin domains during development (32Vassetzky Y. Hair A. Mechali M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1541-1552PubMed Google Scholar). Such rearrangements can impact both chromatin replication and transcription of specific loci. To assess rearrangements in matrix attachments, matrix-associated DNA was isolated from 46m and Pax2 cells and used as a probe for Southern blots containing fragments of the Sfrp2 locus (Fig. 4). Using the 9-kb HindIII sfrp2 fragment, only the matrix-associated DNA from 28Pax2 cells hybridized (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained with 27Pax2 cells, which exhibited hybridization to multiple bands of the genomic Sfrp2 clones digested with different enzymes (Fig. 4B). At no time did the matrix-associated DNAs from the parental 46m cells hybridize to clones spanning the sfrp2 locus. As a control for equal labeling, a GAPDH BAC genomic clone or total genomic mouse DNA were used. The GAPDH BAC clone also contained some repetitive elements and was labeled equally well with both 46m and 28Pax2 probes.Fig. 4Nuclear matrix-associated DNA from Pax2-expressing cells and control 46m cells.A, the left panel shows an ethidium-stained gel of the genomic clones blotted to membranes. A GAPDH BAC was used as a positive control (lane 1). The 9-kb HindIII fragment from the Sfrp2 locus was cut with Sau3A (lane 2). The digests were run on a 1% agarose gel and Southern blotted with subsequent probing by32P-labeled matrix-associated DNA. The labeled DNA was purified from either 28Pax2 or 46m cells as indicated. Note the specific bands hybridized by the 28Pax2 probe in the 9.0 HindIII fragment (arrows). The 46m probe did not hybridize to the Sfrp2 locus despite an equal number of counts and equal labeling, as judged by the GAPDH hybridization pattern. B, similar experiment as in A using nuclear matrix-associated DNAs from the 27Pax2 clonal line. The digests were run on a 2% metaphor agarose gel as follows: lane 1, GAPDH; lane 2, 9.0 HindIII cut with HpaII; lane 3, 9.0 HindIII cut with Sau3A; lane 4, 12.0 Xba cut with HpaII; lane 5, 12.0 Xba cut with Sau3A. Note multiple bands mapping to the sfrp2 locus hybridize with the 27Pax2 DNAs but not with the 46m DNAs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ability of Pax2 to activate the Sfrp2 promoter region was examined in a heterologous system using transient transfections (Fig. 5). The plasmid p2.8PX-CAT fused a 2.8-kb PstI-XhoI upstream of the CAT reporter gene. Transfection into HEK293 or NIH3T3 cells together with increasing amounts of a Pax2 expression plasmid reveals an ability of Pax2 to transactivate directly this promoter region. Activation of reporter gene expression was 2-fold in the presence of Pax2b protein. Although this was not as robust as other Pax2-responsive elements described, the activation was statistically significant and reproducible.Fig. 5A, schematic of the Sfrp2 locus and the reporter construct 2.8 PX Sfrp2-CAT is shown. B, transactivation assays of the reporter 2.8 PX Sfrp2-CAT in transfected 3T3 cells show increased activity with Pax2 co-transfection. Fold activation was calculated relative to the basal level of reporter gene expression. Data were standardized with a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid. Data is presented as average values for activation. Bars, 1 S.D. from the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISC"
https://openalex.org/W2016185948,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is involved in the pathogenesis of several B cell lymphoproliferations, but the precise contribution it makes to the aetiology of each remains unclear. In vitro, the virus has potent growth transforming activity and efficiently induces the continuous proliferation of normal human B cells. A comparison of EBV-infected primary B cells with an isogenic population induced to proliferate by CD40-ligand (CD40L) and IL4 has revealed that EBV can override - by a novel mechanism - the p53/pRb-mediated G1 checkpoint activated in normal B cells by a genotoxic stress. In cells responding to cisplatin, although p53 is stabilized and activated, EBV latent gene expression appears to inhibit the accumulation of newly synthesized p21(WAF1/CIP1) and the downregulation of cyclin D2 that occur in the normal cells. Consequently, in the EBV-infected cells, CDK2 remains active, hyperphosphorylation of pRb is maintained and the replication of damaged DNA can occur. Under conditions of severe genomic stress, this absence of p21(WAF1/CIP1) function can result in apoptosis; however, when damage is less sustained, genomic instability may arise and this in turn could contribute to the development of a variety of EBV-associated B cell malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W1995860234,"The majority of bacterial multidrug resistance transporters belong to the class of secondary transporters. LmrP is a proton/drug antiporter of Lactococcus lactis that extrudes positively charged lipophilic substrates from the inner leaflet of the membrane to the external medium. This study shows that LmrP is a true secondary transporter. In the absence of a proton motive force, LmrP facilitates downhill fluxes of ethidium in both directions. These fluxes are inhibited by other substrates of LmrP. The cysteine-reactive agent p-chloromercuri-benzene sulfonate inhibits these fluxes in wild type LmrP but not in the cysteine-less LmrP C270A mutant. Cysteine mutagenesis of LmrP resulted in three mutants, D68C/C270A, D128C/C270A, and E327C/C270A, with an energy-uncoupled phenotype. Asp68 is located in the conserved motif GXXX(D/E)(R/K)XGRK for the major facilitator superfamily of secondary transporters and was found to play an important role in energy coupling, whereas the negatively charged residues Asp128 and Glu327 have indirect effects on the transport process. L. lactis strains expressing these uncoupled mutants of LmrP show an increased rate of ethidium influx and an increased drug susceptibility compared with cells harboring an empty vector. The rate of influx in these mutants is enhanced by a transmembrane electrical potential, inside negative. These observations suggest a new strategy for eliminating drug-resistant microbial pathogens, i.e. the design and use of modulators of secondary multidrug resistance transporters that uncouple drug efflux from proton influx, thereby allowing transmembrane electrical potential-driven influx of cationic drugs.

Multidrug resistance transporters (MDRs) 1The abbreviations used are: MDR, multidrug resistance transporter; TMS, transmembrane segment; pCMBS, p-chloromercuri-benzene sulfonate; WT, wild type; pmf, proton motive force. play a crucial role in the resistance of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells against cytotoxic compounds. In bacteria, including pathogens, the activities of MDRs contribute to the resistance against antibiotics (1.Appelbaum P.C. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2002; 34: 1613-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 2.Bradley S.F. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2002; 34: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 3.Dye C. Williams B.G.

Dis. 2002; 2: 404-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The control of spread and the prevention of selection of multidrug resistant strains has become a critical issue in the battle against contagious diseases (5.Gill M.J. Brenwald N.P. Wise R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To fight antibiotic resistance efficiently, detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying microbial drug resistance is required. Most bacterial MDRs known to date are secondary transporters. For example, LmrP is a proton motive force (pmf)-driven MDR of Lactococcus lactis (6.Bolhuis H. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26092-26098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). LmrP is a member of the major facilitator superfamily of membrane proteins and shows homology to Bmr and NorA, the MDRs of Bacillus subtilis (7.Neyfakh A.A. Bidnenko V.E. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4781-4785Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and Staphylococcus aureus (8.Yoshida H. Bogaki M. Nakamura S. Ubukata K. Konno M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6942-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), respectively, as well as to the transporters involved in tetracycline resistance and bicyclomycin resistance in Escherichia coli (9.Bentley J. Hyatt L.S. Ainley K. Parish J.H. Herbert R.B. White G.R. Gene. 1993; 127: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cells expressing LmrP have increased resistance to several clinically important antibiotics from different pharmacological classes (10.Putman M. van Veen H.W. Degener J.E. Konings W.N. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 2873-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which indicates the frightening possibility that its homologues in pathogenic bacteria may reduce the efficacy of important antibiotics in clinical settings. In this study we report that LmrP is a true secondary transporter and is able to mediate active efflux and, under non-energized conditions, downhill drug influx and efflux. We show that residue Asp68, located in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane segments (TMS) II and III, is involved in the energy-coupling mechanism but not in substrate binding, whereas Asp128 in the cytoplasmic loop between TMS IV and V is not participating in the binding of ethidium either, but it might be part of the structural framework responsible for retaining a correct folding of the transporter during the transport cycle. Glu327 appears not to be involved either in the binding of ethidium or the coupling of proton flux to ethidium transport. Energy-uncoupled mutants of LmrP were constructed, which showed increased rates of transmembrane electrical potential (Δψ)-driven influx of cationic drugs. The expression of such uncoupled secondary MDRs is disadvantageous and causes increased drug susceptibility to the host cells. This observation may be useful for developing alternative and more efficient strategies of antibiotic therapies.

L. lactis cells were grown at 30 °C in M17 medium (Difco) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. For the growth experiments, the M17 medium was prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7). Expression of LmrP variants from pNZ8048-derived plasmids was induced by adding ∼10 ng of nisin A per milliliter at an A660 of ∼0.6, and cells were harvested 60 min after induction. Recombinant DNA Techniques—General procedures for cloning and DNA manipulation were performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (16.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The PCR overlap extension method (17.Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 16: 7351-7367Crossref Scopus (2102) Google Scholar) was used to introduce mutations in the lmrP gene on the pHLP5 expression plasmid (14.Putman M. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which encodes LmrP with a C-terminal His6 tag. All PCR-amplified DNA fragments were sequenced to verify that only the intended changes were introduced. DNA sequencing was performed at the BioMedical Technology Centre (University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands). Preparation of Membrane Vesicles—Membrane vesicles with an inside-out orientation were prepared from L. lactis NZ9000 (ΔlmrA) cells expressing LmrP variants by the French press procedure as described by Putman et al. (14.Putman M. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The vesicles were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C at a protein concentration of 15–35 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, containing 10% (w/v) glycerol. Measurements of Active Transport—For ethidium transport experiments, whole cells expressing LmrP variants were washed with 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7) containing 5 mm MgSO4, and suspended in the same buffer to an A660 of 0.5. Cells (2 ml) were energized by the addition of 25 mm glucose. After 2 min, 10 μm ethidium was added to the cell suspension, and the accumulation of ethidium was measured indirectly by following the fluorescence of the ethidium-polynucleotide complex in the cells. Fluorescence was monitored with a PerkinElmer LS 50B fluorometer using excitation and emission wavelengths of 500 and 580 nm, respectively. Transport of Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes Inc.) in inside-out membrane vesicles was measured as described by Putman et al. (14.Putman M. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles (0.5 mg of protein/ml) were suspended in 50 mm potassium Hepes (pH 7) containing 2 mm MgSO4, 8.5 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase, and 5 mm phosphocreatine. After incubation for 30 s at 30 °C, 1 μm Hoechst 33342 was added. Upon the addition of 0.5 mm Mg-ATP, LmrP was activated through the generation of the pmf by F0 F1 H+-ATPase. The amount of membrane-associated Hoechst 33342 was measured fluorometrically (PerkinElmer LS 50B) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 457 nm, respectively, and slit widths of 5 nm each. Measurements of Passive Fluxes—Cells were grown as described for measurements of active transport of ethidium. After the wash step, cells were resuspended to an A660 of 1. Cells present in 2 ml of this suspension were pelleted by centrifugation and loaded with 25 μm ethidium for 30 min at 30 °C in the final volume of 400 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7) containing 5 mm MgSO4. To determine the influence of p-chloromercuri-benzene sulfonate (pCMBS) on passive fluxes of ethidium, the cell suspension was incubated for an additional 5 min with 0.5 mm freshly dissolved pCMBS prior to or after incubation with ethidium for influx and efflux experiments, respectively. After loading with ethidium, cells were pelleted by centrifugation in a table centrifuge (2 min at 14,000 rpm), and resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7) containing 5 mm MgSO4. For fluxes, measurements 50 μl from this cell suspension were used. Determination of the Growth Rate—For the determination of growth rate in the presence of ethidium, cells were grown in microtiter plates as described (18.Sakamoto K. Margolles A. van Veen H.W.

The cells were diluted in fresh medium to an A660 of 0.05, and 150-μl aliquots of the cell suspension were transferred to sterile low protein binding 96-well microplates (Garneir, Germany) containing 50 μl of various concentrations of ethidium in fresh medium. For the induction of expression of LmrP, nisin (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 100 pg/ml. Aliquots (50 μl) of sterile silicon oil were pipetted on top of the sample to prevent evaporation. The cells were grown at 30 °C, and the cell densities were monitored by measuring the absorbance at 690 nm every 10 min for 16 h in a multiscan photometer (Molecular Devices, Spectra Max 340). The ethidium concentration that inhibits the growth rate by 50% (IC50 value) was determined. Wild Type LmrP Is Sensitive to pCMBS—Wild type LmrP contains one native cysteine residue, Cys270, which is not accessible to the cysteine-reactive agent fluorescein maleimide and is most likely located in the putative TMS VIII (Fig. 1) (15.Mazurkiewicz P. Konings W.N. Poelarends G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26081-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In a previous report (15.Mazurkiewicz P. Konings W.N. Poelarends G.J. J. Biol.

To evaluate the role of Cys270, the effects of several cysteine-reactive agents were tested on LmrP-mediated transport of Hoechst 33342 and ethidium. These compounds are good substrates of LmrP and can be used for transport studies in whole cells and inside-out membrane vesicles (6.Bolhuis H. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26092-26098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14.Putman M. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 19.Bolhuis H. Molenaar D. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6957-6964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hoechst 33342 is highly fluorescent when present in the lipid environment of membranes but essentially non-fluorescent in the aqueous phase. Transport of Hoechst 33342 from the membrane into the aqueous phase can therefore be followed in membrane vesicles by monitoring the Hoechst 33342 fluorescence over time. The addition of ATP to inside-out membrane vesicles of L. lactis results in the generation of a pmf through proton pumping by the F1F0-ATPase. This pmf drives the transport of Hoechst 33342 by LmrP out of the membrane as indicated by the decrease in Hoechst 33342 fluorescence (Fig. 2). Wild type LmrP-mediated Hoechst 33342 transport was not affected by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate, 2-aminoethyl-methanethiosulfonate, or N-ethylmaleimide (data not shown), whereas pCMBS, a cysteine-reactive mercurial compound, inhibited Hoechst 33342 transport completely (Fig. 2). Inhibition of transport by pCMBS appears to be due to the reaction of Cys270 with pCMBS (Fig. 2), because pCMBS did not affect the generation of the pmf in inside-out membrane vesicles (data not shown) and did not inhibit Hoechst 33342 transport by the cysteine-less LmrP mutant C270A. The effect of pCMBS on LmrP-mediated ethidium fluxes was also investigated. Ethidium crosses the membrane passively and intercalates subsequently into cellular polynucleotides, whereupon it becomes highly fluorescent. Ethidium transport in whole cells can be measured indirectly by monitoring the fluorescence of this intracellular ethidium-polynucleotide complex. Cationic compounds such as ethidium are electrophoretically imported into energized bacterial cells, and this process is driven by the Δψ (inside negative). Consequently, significant levels of accumulation of cationic compounds can occur even in the absence of an active uptake system (20.Hsieh P.C. Siegel S.A. Rogers B. Davis D. Lewis K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6602-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21.Severina I.I. Muntyan M.S. Lewis K. Skulachev V.P. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Binding of ethidium to the cellular polynucleotides can further contribute to drug accumulation in cells relative to the environment. Ethidium accumulation by LmrA-deficient, glucose-energized cells expressing the WT LmrP and nonexpressing control cells demonstrated that WT LmrP can reduce the accumulation of ethidium in the cell by excreting this cationic compound (Fig. 3A) (6.Bolhuis H.

Also the C270A variant of LmrP is capable of reducing the cellular accumulation of ethidium, indicating that this mutant has retained significant transport activity (Fig. 3A) (15.Mazurkiewicz P. Konings W.N. Poelarends G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26081-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The extrusion of ethidium is dependent on the presence of a pmf. In the absence of metabolic energy, ethidium is not actively extruded, and only the influx of ethidium across the membrane occurs. In control cells lacking LmrP, the influx of ethidium under non-energized conditions is very slow (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, non-energized cells expressing the WT or cysteine-less variant of LmrP have drastically higher rates of ethidium influx (Fig. 3B). Similar observations were made for the ethidium flux in the opposite direction. Under non-energized conditions, the rates of ethidium efflux were significantly lower from ethidium-preloaded, LmrP-nonexpressing cells than from ethidium-preloaded WT LmrP and LmrP C270A mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 3C). The rates of the ethidium fluxes were proportional to the level of expression of LmrP (data not shown). These observations demonstrate that LmrP facilitates the flux of ethidium across the membrane in the absence of a pmf. Additional evidence that the ethidium flux is, to a large extent, LmrP-mediated was obtained by treatment of cells with pCMBS. pCMBS did not affect ethidium fluxes in control cells not expressing LmrP or in cells expressing C270A mutant LmrP, whereas it decreased drastically the fluxes of ethidium in cells expressing the WT LmrP (Figs. 2 and 3, D and E). These ethidium fluxes were inhibited by tetraphenylphosphonium, a well known substrate of LmrP (22.Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Brands J.R. Putman M. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24123-24128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and the inhibitor verapamil (23.Putman M. Koole L.A. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13900-13905Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), providing further support for the proposal that LmrP mediates facilitated fluxes of ethidium in non-energized cells (Fig. 3F and data not shown). Energy-uncoupled Mutants of LmrP Also Facilitate Drug Influx in Energized Cells—Recently, the interesting observation was made that energized cells of L. lactis expressing variants of LmrP C270A with a single cysteine substitution 2It should be noted that the annotation of the cysteine mutants used in this manuscript differs from the annotation used in Ref. 15.Mazurkiewicz P. Konings W.N. Poelarends G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26081-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar (D68C/C270A was D68C, D128C/C270A was D128C, and E327C/C270A was E327C). (D68C/C270A, D128C/C270A, or E327C/C270A) accumulated ethidium rapidly (Fig. 4) (15.Mazurkiewicz P. Konings W.N. Poelarends G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26081-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas WT LmrP extrudes ethidium under these conditions. The ethidium influx rates into these cells were comparable with the influx rates observed in non-energized cells expressing WT LmrP (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that the cysteine mutants D68C/C270A, D128C/C270A, and E327C/C270A are energy-uncoupled and capable of catalyzing only a facilitated diffusion of substrates. It is noteworthy that the influx rates into cells expressing these mutant proteins are slightly lower under non-energized conditions than under energized conditions (compare Figs. 4 and 5), which is consistent with the notion that the Δψ (inside negative) accelerates the facilitated diffusion process of this positively charged substrate. Sensitivity of Single Cysteine Mutants to pCMBS—The effects of pCMBS on ethidium fluxes in L. lactis cells expressing the single cysteine mutants of LmrP were also investigated (Fig. 5). pCMBS (0.5 mm) strongly inhibited the influx and efflux of ethidium in cells expressing the D68C/C270A mutant or WT LmrP (Fig. 5, A and D). In contrast, pCMBS did not inhibit either influx or efflux of ethidium in cells expressing D128C/C270A (Fig. 5, B and E) or E327C/C270A (Fig. 5, C and F) mutants. Labeling of residues D128C/C270A and E327C/C270A by fluorescein maleimide could be prevented by preincubation of protein with pCMBS, demonstrating that both residues are accessible to this mercurial (data not shown). Phenotype of D68C, D128C, and E327C Mutants of LmrP— To investigate whether the observed uncoupled phenotype of the D68C/C270A, D128C/C270A, and E327C/C270A mutants was caused by changing two residues in LmrP, the mutations giving an uncoupled phenotype in the cysteine-less background of the mutant C270A were also introduced into WT LmrP possessing Cys270. All three mutants were expressed to levels similar to that of WT LmrP (data not shown). The D68C mutant retained the uncoupled phenotype of the D68C/C270A mutant, whereas the D128C mutant catalyzed facilitated diffusion of ethidium into energized cells, but to a lower extent than the D128C/C270A mutant did. Unexpectedly, the E327C mutant exhibited a high transport activiy of ethidium (Fig. 6), indicating that both mutations are responsible for the uncoupled phenotype of the E327C/C270A mutant. Cells Expressing the Energy-uncoupled Mutants of LmrP Are More Susceptible to Ethidium—Because the LmrP mutants D68C/C270A, D128C/C270A, and E327C/C270A facilitate influx of ethidium, cells expressing these mutants should be more sensitive to drugs than nonexpressing control cells. To test this hypothesis, we followed the effects of ethidium on the growth of L. lactis NZ9000 (ΔlmrA) harboring the empty vector pNZ8048 or its derivatives encoding WT LmrP or mutants D270A, D68C/C270A, D128C/C270A, and E327C/C270A (Fig. 7). Concentrations of ethidium that resulted in a 50% reduction of the growth rates (IC50) are given in Table I. For cells harboring the empty vector, the IC50 was 6.5 μm; the IC50 increased to 11 μm for cells expressing WT LmrP and to 7.8 μm for cells expressing C270A LmrP. In contrast, cells expressing LmrP mutants D68C/C270A, D128C/C270A, and E327C/C270A were significantly more sensitive to ethidium than the control cells not expressing LmrP and displayed IC50 values of ∼1.9, 2, and 3.2 μm, respectively.Table IEthidium susceptibilities of L. lactis NZ9000 (Δ lmrA) harboring vector pNZ8048 and its derivatives encoding WT LmrP and the mutants C270A, D68C/C270A, D128C/C270A, and E327C/C270AEmpty vectorWT LmrPC270AD68C/C270AD128C/C270AE327C/C270AμmμmμmμmμmμmIC506.5 ± 0.211 ± 0.27.8 ± 0.41.9 ± 0.42 ± 0.43.2 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab In this study the sensitivity of WT LmrP to pCMBS was used to demonstrate that LmrP plays a major role in the high fluxes of ethidium across the membranes under non-energized conditions. Ethidium accumulation was followed by measuring fluorescence of the cellular ethidium-polynucleotide complex. The influx of ethidium into (Fig. 3D) and the efflux of ethidium out of non-energized cells (Fig. 3E) were blocked upon the incubation of cells with pCMBS in cells expressing WT LmrP but not in cells expressing the cysteine-less mutant C270A. The rate of facilitated diffusion of ethidium under non-energized conditions increased with the expression levels of LmrP, and the ethidium fluxes are inhibited by other substrates of LmrP. Furthermore, we have generated LmrP mutants that are energy-uncoupled. These mutants facilitate rapid entry and exit of drugs into and out of the cell but are unable to secrete the drugs against their concentration gradient. These mutants resemble previously described energy-uncoupled mutants of the lactose permease (24.Brooker R.J. Myster S.H. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8135-8140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Green A.L. Anderson E.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23240-23246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that LmrP behaves as a true secondary transporter capable of mediating facilitated diffusion of substrates in both directions, depending on the direction of the substrate gradient. Cells expressing a single cysteine variant of C270A LmrP (D68C/C270A, D128C/C270A, or E327C/C270A) rapidly accumulate ethidium under both non-energized and energized conditions (Figs. 4 and 5, A–C) and clearly exhibit an energy-uncoupled phenotype. However, the influx of ethidium is slower under non-energized conditions than under energized conditions, suggesting that the Δψ (inside negative) pulls cationic drugs into the cells (20.Hsieh P.C. Siegel S.A. Rogers B. Davis D. Lewis K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6602-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21.Severina I.I. Muntyan M.S. Lewis K. Skulachev V.P. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These data also demonstrate that the negatively charged residues Asp68, Asp128, and Glu327 are not essential for ethidium binding. pCMBS inhibited the facilitated diffusion of ethidium in the D68C/C270A mutant, but not in the D128C/C270A and E327C/C270A mutants (Fig. 5). Because these residues are all accessible to pCMBS (data not shown), it appears that Asp128 and Glu327 are not in close proximity to either the binding site for ethidium or the substrate translocation pathway. To determine whether the uncoupled behavior of the single cysteine variants D68C/C270A, D128C/C270A, and E327C/C270A of LmrP is due to introduction of two mutations, i.e. an acidic amino acid to cysteine and the native Cys270 to alanine, an additional set of mutants was constructed, namely D68C, D128C, and E327C using WT LmrP as the template. One of these mutants, D68C, catalyzed the facilitated diffusion of ethidium into energized cells (Fig. 6), confirming a role of the Asp68 in the energy-coupling mechanism. Asp68 is part of the conserved motif, GXXX(D/E)(R/K)XGRK, located in the cytoplasmic loop between TMS II and TMS III of the major facilitator superfamily of secondary transporters that are involved in the transport of a variety of compounds (26.Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. Gene. 1993; 124: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The function of this motif has been extensively studied in other transporters. It is of interest to note that, for the tetracycline transporter TetA(B), it has been demonstrated that Asp66 (homologous to Asp68 in LmrP) does not directly participate in substrate binding but is part of the gating mechanism of TetA(B) (27.Yamaguchi A. Ono N. Akasaka T. Noumi T. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15525-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, N-ethylmaleimide labeling of a cysteine residue introduced next to the Asp66 in TetA(B) inhibited tetracycline transport, further suggesting that this region is essential for coupling transport to the pmf. In the E. coli lactose permease (LacY), substitutions of the conserved Asp68 almost completely abolish transport activity of lactose permease (28.Jessen-Marshall A.E. Paul N.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16251-16257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29.Frillingos S. Sun J. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, these mutants have not been reported to be uncoupled and display very low rates of downhill transport of lactose (28.Jessen-Marshall A.E. Paul N.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16251-16257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29.Frillingos S. Sun J. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Conservation of this motif among members of the major facilitator superfamily suggests that this region is not directly involved in substrate binding but, instead, may be critical in facilitating conformational changes following substrate binding (30.Jessen-Marshall A.E. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1400-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The motif is connected with TMS II, which undergoes a conformational change upon interaction of lactose permease with ligands (25.Green A.L. Anderson E.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23240-23246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31.Wu J. Kaback H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and faces the substrate binding cavity (32.Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that mutation D68C alters the structure of the loop connecting TMS II and TMS III and further disturbs the orientation of these two TMSs, thereby interfering with the coupling between the H+ flux and substrate translocation. The D128C mutant appeared to be less efficient in facilitating influx of ethidium into energized cells than the D128C/C270A mutant (compare Figs. 4 and 6). At this stage, the function of Asp128 remains obscure. For the TetA(B) transporter, it has been proposed that Asp120 (corresponding to Asp128 in LmrP) forms an ion pair with an arginine residue present in a loop region between TMS II and TMS III, thereby ensuring a correct structure of the protein (33.Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19155-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Someya Y. Kimura-Someya T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 210-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The third mutant, E327C, extrudes ethidium efficiently (Fig. 6), ruling out a role of Glu327 in proton translocation or ethidium binding. However, the presence of a negative charge at this location is critical for the interaction of LmrP with the divalent cation Hoechst 33342 (15.Mazurkiewicz P. Konings W.N. Poelarends G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26081-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting that Glu327 is part of the substrate binding pocket of LmrP. The two mutations in the E327C/C270A mutant thus seem to affect the conformation in this binding region in such a way that pmf-driven transport of ethidium and Hoechst 33342 is no longer possible. In summary, the uncoupled phenotype of mutants D68C and D128C is most likely the result of structural perturbations within LmrP, and these residues most likely do not play a direct role in H+ translocation. The observations describe above demonstrate that mutations of the native cysteine in LmrP, Cys270, somehow affect the activity of the transporter. In a previous study (15.Mazurkiewicz P. Konings W.N. Poelarends G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26081-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we have shown that Cys270 is not accessible to fluorescein maleimide labeling and, therefore, is most likely membrane-embedded. In this report we tested several other cysteine-reactive compounds to probe the role of Cys270, but only pCMBS was found to inhibit the transport activity of WT LmrP. Because pCMBS had no effect on the activity of the cysteine-less mutant C270A, we conclude that this mercurial targets Cys270. This residue is likely located in a transmembrane region of the protein that is poorly accessible to the water phase, because the maleimide probes were not effective (35.Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21193-21199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36.Venkatesan P. Liu Z. Hu Y. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10649-10655Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nevertheless Cys270 is not essential for transport, as the C270A mutant showed substantial activity. Inhibition of transport by pCMBS could be due to the location of Cys270 close to a substrate binding site or to the translocation pathways of substrates and/or protons. A location in the substrate binding site seems unlikely, because the affinity of the C270A mutant for Hoechst 33342 is unchanged upon reaction with pCMBS. 3P. Mazurkiewicz, unpublished results. Alternatively, pCMBS-labeling of Cys270 may interfere with conformational changes of LmrP during the transport cycle. It is noteworthy that the significant Hoechst 33342 and ethidium transport activity of the C270A mutant excludes a direct role of Cys270 in proton translocation. One conclusion of our work is that the presence of a secondary WT MDR, such as LmrP, causes the rapid influx of drugs under non-energized conditions. This observation demonstrates that LmrP is a proper secondary transporter and mediates active transport and, in the absence of pmf, downhill fluxes of substrates. These modes of transport are typical for secondary transporters and have been described previously (37.Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 38.Kaczorowski G.J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3691-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Notably, we report here a new important finding that expression of an uncoupled MDR increases the sensitivity of cells to ethidium even under energized conditions. Clearly, expression of such an energy-uncoupled secondary MDR allows a membrane potential-driven accumulation of a toxic cationic substrate in cells. Consequently these cells are more susceptible to drugs than cells that do not express the transporter at all. On the contrary for neutral substrates, as reported for uncoupled mutants of lactose permease, only fluxes down a chemical substrate gradient or exchange reaction are possible (39.Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). For a neutral substrate, such concentration-driven fluxes do not lead to accumulation in cells. This knowledge may be used to develop new strategies in the battle against multidrug-resistant pathogens. Modulators of secondary MDRs, which do not compete with the antibiotic for the same binding site but uncouple drug efflux from proton influx, will allow Δψ-driven accumulation of cationic antibiotic substrates, resulting in an increased drug sensitivity of the pathogens."

In 1993, a disease affecting certain maize and winter wheat lines was observed in several high plains states of the United States Great Plains region (1.Jardine D.J. Bowden R.L. Jensen S.G.

By the end of 1995 its presence had been confirmed over a wide area (3.Jensen S.G. Lane L.C. Seifers D.L. Plant Dis. 1996; 80: 1387-1390Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This “high plains disease” has a relatively extensive host range, and it can cause severe or lethal symptoms on susceptible maize, wheat, barley, and several species of grasses (4.Seifers D.L.

The disease is consistently associated with a characteristic cytopathology in which spherical or ovoid 150–200-nm double-membrane vesicles accumulate in the cytoplasm of affected cells (5.Ahn K.K.

Analysis of the nucleic acid complement of infected plants revealed five characteristic species of double-stranded RNA, and a specific ribonucleoprotein, whose protein component has been estimated by SDS-PAGE to have a mass of ∼32 kDa (3.Jensen S.G.

The disease is characterized by the development of chlorotic spots that parallel the leaf veins. As the disease progresses, the chlorotic spots merge to give a generalized chlorosis. However, symptoms vary greatly with different host genotypes, environments, plant growth stage at time of initial infection, and combination with other infecting viruses.

The similarities in (a) transmission by eriophyid mite vectors, (b) induction of spot mosaic symptoms, and (c) formation of 150–200 nm double membrane particles in the cytoplasm of affected cells suggest that HPV is a member of a group of virus-like plant pathogens that cause wheat spot mosaic, fig mosaic, thistle mosaic, rose rosette, and redbud yellow ringspot diseases (5.Ahn K.K. Kim K.S. Gergerich R.C. Jensen S.G. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1998; 30: 563-571PubMed Google Scholar). No one has yet succeeded in isolating and characterizing infectious HPV particles. Until recently, there was no other way to propagate the disease agent except to use live wheat curl mites. Using wheat curl mites for experimental transmission and propagation approximates what happens to plants grown in the field but makes it very difficult to obtain HPV infections free of wheat streak mosaic virus, as the vector usually harbors both this virus and HPV (8.Marçon A. Kaeppler S.M. Jensen S.G. Senior L. Stuber C. Crop Sci. 1999; 39: 1171-1177Crossref Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that the “32-kDa” protein specifically associated with HPV can be characterized by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS), following HPV isolation in pure culture by “vascular puncture inoculation” (9.Louie R.

HPV Isolates—The HPV isolates to be characterized were obtained from symptomatic maize (Zea mays L.) collected in Kansas in 1996 (KS96) and Idaho in 1997 (ID97). Serological and infectivity assays were used to confirm the absence of other viruses (particularly wheat streak mosaic virus) in each HPV isolate. The identity of HPV was indicated by infectivity assay and SDS-PAGE. Confirmation was obtained by ELISA and Western blotting, using antiserum developed and provided by S. G. Jensen (United States Department of Agriculture/Agricultural Research Service, Lincoln, NE). Use of this antiserum permitted direct comparison of serological results from these investigations with those of previous studies of HPV (3.Jensen S.G. Lane L.C. Seifers D.L.

To ensure purity, the HPV isolates were maintained in culture in “Spirit” corn by vascular puncture inoculation of kernels (7.Seifers D.L. Harvey T.L. Louie R. Gordon D.T. Martin T.J.

Generation of HPV Protein for Analysis by TOFMS—HPV-specific protein for mass spectrometric (MS) analysis was obtained after electrophoretic separation (SDS-PAGE), staining with Coomassie Blue R-250, and excision of the ∼32 kDa protein band. The excised HPV-specific protein band from each gel was digested with various endoproteinases as described by She et al. (11.She Y.M. Wang G.Q. Loboda A. Ens W. Standing K.G. Burczynski F.J. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 310: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), using sequencing grade trypsin, Lys-C, Glu-C, and Asp-N purchased from Roche Diagnostic Corp. Enzymatic digestion was performed on the gel-separated proteins using either: 10 ng of trypsin, 50 ng of Lys-C, or Glu-C, in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate or else 50 ng of Asp-N in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) solution. Peptide extractions with sonication usually yielded sufficient material for analyses covering most of the protein sequence. Derivatization—To facilitate de novo peptide sequencing, we enhanced the production of y ions from some of the selected peptides by derivatizing the in-gel tryptic digest with sulfonic acid. The peptides were dehydrated, then reacted with chlorosulfonylacetyl chloride, as described by Keough et al. (12.Keough T. Youngquist R.S. Lacey M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7131-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Improved yield of the sulfonated product was achieved by repeating the reaction three times. Mass Spectrometry and Characterization of Peptide Amino Acid Sequences—After digestion or chemical modification, the samples were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) on a QqTOF mass spectrometer (13.Loboda A.V. Krutchinsky A.N. Bromirski M. Ens W. Standing K.G. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 14: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) as described previously (14.Seifers D.L. Salomon R.

MS/MS daughter ion spectra were obtained after collision-induced dissociation (CID) in the QqTOF collision cell. Protein or peptide sequences were then determined by manual interpretation of the MS and MS/MS measurements and identified by data base searching with the computer programs MS-Tag, BLAST, or FASTA. Protein extracts from infected tissue (propagated by vascular puncture inoculation) were shown by ELISA to react to an HPV antiserum (3.Jensen S.G. Lane L.C. Seifers D.L. Plant Dis. 1996; 80: 1387-1390Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When examined by SDS-PAGE, the extracts yielded a ∼32-kDa band (Fig. 1), which was not present in control extracts from uninfected tissue, and which reacted in Western blots to the specific antiserum. Deducing aa Sequences from the Initial Tryptic Digests—Fig. 2 shows products from the tryptic digest of a gel slice containing the 32-kDa protein band extracted from isolate ID97. The spectrum is fairly complex, making analysis difficult. In addition, we believed initially that we were faced with a completely de novo sequencing problem, although this turned out to be only partially true. Thus it was clearly important to simplify the problem by choosing appropriate sequencing strategies. Analysis of the prominent 2448/2476 Da “doublet” shown in Fig. 2 illustrates the difficulty. MS/MS measurements yielded similar daughter ion spectra in the lower m/z range, from which we could extract putative y1 to y16 ions, indicating that the two parents were closely related. However, we were unable to find y fragments between y16 and the parent ion, or their b ion counterparts, so the most interesting parts of the peptides remained undefined. Here we found sulfonation at the N terminus (12.Keough T. Youngquist R.S. Lacey M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7131-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) especially valuable. Fig. 3 shows the doublet before and after sulfonation. Although sulfonation has somewhat worsened the signal/noise ratio, the defining peaks are still well above background, and unit mass resolution is still obtained. Fig. 4 shows the corresponding MS/MS spectra. Thanks to sulfonation, these spectra can be interpreted directly as complete series of y ions up to y22 (as labeled in Fig. 4 and listed in Table I), permitting straightforward deduction of the corresponding aa sequences. Both peaks indeed correspond to the same peptide, apart from the two indicated single nucleotide mutations.Fig. 4MS/MS spectra of theFig. 3Bdoublet, i.e. daughter ion spectra after sulfonic acid derivatization and CID.A, from the 2570-Da parent; B, from the 2598-Da parent.

We had hoped only that some of the observed peptides might serve to characterize HPV and that perhaps there would be some homology between these putative HPV peptides and the recorded sequences of other viruses. Instead, we were pleasantly surprised to find that most of the peptides corresponded almost exactly to portions of a specific amino acid sequence listed as AAB03575 and designated as the “the probable N-protein of high plains virus,” 2J. S. Hall, S. G. Jensen, and R. C. French, GenBank™ accession number U60141. of which we had not previously been aware. AAB03575 had been deduced from the cDNA sequence (U60141) of a reverse-transcribed RNA component of an infectious isolate prepared by the Nebraska group, and deposited in GenBank™, but not otherwise published. Thus our mass spectrometric measurements served to confirm the previously tentative identification of U60141 with high plains disease (see discussion below). Unexpectedly, however, the tryptic peptide fragment at m/z = 3522.653 that included the N-terminal sequence deduced from U60141 had an additional single glutamic acid (Asp) residue at its N terminus (Fig. 5), showing that the data base-listed sequence was not complete. Moreover, several additional peaks had been observed and their corresponding peptide fragments sequenced de novo (Table II, part 4). While these sequences all corresponded to the same protein, its peptides had no closely matching counterparts in any protein data base. Was this part of a separate protein, or was its sequence part of the “complete” HPV N-protein sequence? None of the observed tryptic fragments overlapped the U60141-deduced aa sequence (Table II), leaving this question open. Additional Proteolytic Digests—To decide between the two possibilities, we generated new sets of fragments using different endoproteinases (Asp-N and Glu-C). Fortunately this succeeded in generating peptides that also started from the N terminus of the “unknown” protein but were considerably larger. Sequencing these peptides by MS and MS/MS measurements gave overlaps of as many as 13 residues with the sequence predicted by U60141; see Table III. Thus an additional 18 residues were found to be part of the actual HPV aa sequence, so the sequence predicted by the nucleic acid data (U60141) is indeed incomplete (see discussion below).Table IIIProteolytic fragments from the HPV protein LLSFKNSSGVLKAKTLKDGFVTSSDIETTVHDFSYEKPDLSSVDGFSLKS...

The assignment of N-terminal residues for the “new” peptides shown in Tables I and III was based on a nominal interpretation of the MS data that allowed an error tolerance up to ∼50 mDa, but closer examination reveals inconsistencies in this interpretation. Note that all values of Δm for the new N-terminal peptides are negative, with an average value of about -32 mDa (Table III), whereas Δm for the collection of peptides listed in the upper part of Table II has an root mean square value ∼7.8 mDa and an average value <0.8 mDa (similar to the values obtained in previous measurements on the same instrument (14.Seifers D.L.

Such a discrepancy might easily be overlooked if less accurate MS techniques had been used, but it is clearly unacceptable for measurements with our QqTOF instrument. MS/MS measurements on the new peptides yielded additional information. Fig. 6 shows the simplest example: the daughter ion spectrum from breakup of the 607-Da parent ion. Table IVa lists the difference between observed and calculated masses for the daughter ions on the basis of the nominal sequence assignment. All b ion masses differ from the calculated values by more than 30 mDa. By contrast, the masses of the y1 to y4 daughter ions all differ from calculation by 5 mDa or less, whereas the mass of y5 differs by 37 mDa. Results of MS/MS measurements on the other new peptides were consistent with this pattern (see Supplemental Figs. S1–S5), unambiguously pointing to an error in the assignment of the first residue.Table IVDaughter ions from the N-terminal tryptic peptide parent ion at m/z 607.345A.

Table IVb shows the masses calculated assuming @A to be at the N terminus. These all agree with the observed masses of the b and y ions within 5 mDa, and similar improvements were obtained in the Δm values of Tables I and III, convincing evidence that acetylated alanine rather than leucine/isoleucine constitutes the actual N terminus of the HPV protein. (We note that hydroxylation of proline yields a compound (hydroxyproline) with the same elemental composition as @A, and thus the same mass, but this is an unusual modification that would not be expected to occur at the N terminus.) Amino Acid Variations in the KS96 and ID97 HPV Isolates—The sequence deduced from U60141 consists of 270 aa residues, whereas the sequences determined for both KS96 and ID97 contain, as noted above, an extra 18 residues at the N terminus. An additional three isolates from different geographic locations (not described here) were also found to contain the same extra residues, so it appears that HPV normally contains 288 aa residues. The overall results are shown in Table V. For both isolates, more than 85% of the residues were determined. The isolates each consist of a mixture of subpopulations, one of which contains an aa sequence corresponding directly to the one derived from U60141. Subpopulations with Glu, Asp, or Asn at position 186 are present in both. Other variations that define isolate subpopulations are listed in Tables I and V.Table VComparison of the measured amino acid sequences of the HPV protein isolates ID97 and KS96 with the sequence predicted by U60141001@ALSFKNSSGVLKAKTLKDGFVTSSDIETTVHDFSYEKPDLSSVDGFSLKSID97———-———-———-———-———-KS96———-———-———-———-———-051LLSSDGWHIVVAYQSVTNSERLNNNKKNNKTQRFKLFTFDIIVIPGLKPNID97–§§§—–———-———-———-———-KS96———-———-———-———-———-101KSKNVVSYNRFMALCIGMICYHKKWKVFNWSNKRYEDNKNTINFNEDDDFID97———-———-———-—- -———-KS96———-———-———-—- -———-151MNKLAMSAGFSKEHKYHWFYSTGFEYTFDIFPAEVIAMSLFRWSHRVELKID97———-–——–KS96——-———-———-201IKYEHESDLVAPMVRQVTKRGNISDVMDIVGKDIIAKKYEEIVKDRSSIGID97—‡———– -———-—Σ—————-KS96—‡———– -———-———-———-251IGTKYNDILDEFKDIFNKIDSSSLDSTIKNCFNKIDGEID97———-———¥¥¥——–—-††–KS96———-———-———-—- Open table in a new tab In all cases, the C-terminal 270-aa residues of the HPV isolates are highly homologous to the U60141 sequence, and from Table V it can be seen that a consensus sequence accounting for about 88% of the observed residues can be assembled. Previous attempts to characterize the HPV agent have been hindered by the need to transmit the infectious agent with the wheat curl mite vector, which naturally transmits wheat streak mosaic virus along with HPV. Vascular puncture inoculation eliminates the problem, making it possible to establish pure cultures of HPV-infected plants and thus ensuring that protein unique to infected plants is indeed disease-specific. Our investigation demonstrates the power of combining this method of sample preparation with protein characterization by mass spectrometry. In the present case, the analysis was aided by the unanticipated discovery that our MS-determined sequence had extensive homology with an aa sequence that had been deduced from a partial cDNA of double-stranded RNA extracted from ribonucleoproteins of diseased plants (U60141). Nevertheless, our MS analysis revealed that the U60141 sequence was incomplete, and indeed this might have been suspected from the absence of an open reading frame in U60141, likely arising from the inherent difficulties in generating full-length cDNA clones from double-stranded RNA. Although the MS-based approach to analyzing HPV-specific protein avoids these difficulties entirely, determining the complete protein sequence nonetheless required a thorough MS analysis. Data base searching followed simply by protein identification would of course have yielded no information about the additional aa residues at the N terminus, illustrating the limitations of the commonly used “high-throughput” measurements. Moreover, it was essential in this case to use an array of different proteinases to obtain digest fragments that would define the additional residues. This emphasizes the need to adapt one's strategy to observations as they are made. Another feature of the measurement was the ability to distinguish between leucine and acetylated alanine (Δm = 36 mDa) as the N-terminal residue, which could only be accomplished with high mass accuracy MS. As an obvious consequence of this observation, we predict that a complete cDNA transcript of RNA from the HPV-specific ribonucleoprotein will contain codons for Ala-Leu/Ile-Ser... rather than Leu/Ile-Leu/Ile-Ser... corresponding to the N-terminal of the protein. Several naturally occurring sequence variants were readily characterized in these analyses as components of the overall population of HPV-specific protein molecules. This is a critical advantage of mass spectrometry over nucleic acid sequencing of viral nucleic acid cDNA, as the latter necessarily involves the analysis of solely a clonal subpopulation. Examination of the sequence by BLAST (16.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

Nevertheless, as mentioned above, biological evidence suggests that HPV is related to a group of unusual virus-like plant pathogens that cause wheat spot mosaic, fig mosaic, thistle mosaic, rose rosette, and redbud yellow ringspot diseases (5.Ahn K.K. Kim K.S. Gergerich R.C. Jensen S.G. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1998; 30: 563-571PubMed Google Scholar), none of which have yet been sequenced. On the basis of the present results, we believe that a good method of investigating such a relationship at the molecular level, is to extract protein fractions from plants affected by these diseases and subject them to MS sequence analysis; this task is now much easier with a “type” sequence (HPV) in hand. Such evidence will be important in addressing the outstanding questions of the taxonomic affilations of this group of unusual plant pathogens.

https://openalex.org/W2080145163,"In subclones of the human colon cancer LoVo cell line, there is a reproducible spontaneous transition from an epithelioid (E) to a round (R) morphotype. The E to R transition is associated with increased cell growth, absence of E-cadherin-dependent compaction in a slow aggregation assay, loss of contact inhibition of motility and directional migration in a wound filling motility assay. Furthermore, none of the E subclones from LoVo was invasive into chick heart fragments. This is in contrast to the R subclones that were either nonadherent or adherent and invasive. Macroarray analysis demonstrated transcriptional downregulation of plakoglobin in R type LoVo cells and this was confirmed at the level of the mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR. Western blotting showed lower expression of all components of the E-cadherin/catenin complex in R subclones. Interestingly, treatment of R subclones with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine resulted in restoration of the E morphotype, higher expression of E-cadherin, but not plakoglobin mRNA, and higher expression of E-cadherin and plakoglobin at the protein level."
