https://openalex.org/W1571315859,"Abstract A protocol is presented for the quantitative conversion of cysteine and cystine residues in proteins to residues of S-cyanocysteine, using the reagent 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid (Degani, Y., and Patchornik, A. (1971) J. Org. Chem. 36, 2727). Cleavage of the amino peptide bond of the S-cyanocysteine residue is obtained upon exposure to 6 m guanidinium chloride-0.1 m sodium borate, pH 9.0, at 37° for 12 hours, with concomitant formation of 2-iminothiazolidine-4-carboxylyl peptides. Application of the method to several proteins indicates that virtually complete cleavage can be obtained and that there are no significant side reactions due to exposure to alkaline pH. A mechanism for the cleavage reaction is proposed in which specific hydroxide ion catalysis is followed by concerted peptide bond cleavage and ring closure, without the intermediate formation of an acyliminothiazolidine."

In this way the blood-brain barrier was avoided and precise quantities of the drug were delivered to the intended sites. Ten micrograms of morphine in the posterior hypothalamus resulted in siginificant analgesia, while the same dose injected into the medial septum, the caudate, or the periaqueductal gray matter yielded hyperalgesia. The morphine-produced hyperalgesia at the last-mentioned site was accompanied by stereotyped violent circular leaps, an effect of morphine not previously reported. Thus, intracerebral injections of morphine differ significantly from systemic injections and produce either analgesia or hyperalgesia, depending on site and dose."

https://openalex.org/W1501459648,"Abstract The process of ribosome run-off from messenger RNA in the presence of puromycin, elongation factor G and an additional factor was further studied. Formation of run-off ribosomes (release of ribosomes) from naturally occurring polysomes was measured by following the conversion of polysomes into 70 S ribosomes. The optimum concentrations of Mg2+ and NH4+ for this process were 5 to 8 mm and 70 to 80 mm, respectively. Fusidic acid and sparsomycin were inhibitory. Since sparsomycin has been found to inhibit the release of the nascent polypeptide from the ribosome in the presence of puromycin, it was postulated that the substrate for this enzymatic release of ribosomes would be the complex of messenger RNA, ribosome, and unesterified transfer RNA. For the release of ribosomes from this complex, the simultaneous presence of elongation factor G, GTP, and the additional factor were necessary. The release of ribosomes from messenger RNA was accompanied by the simultaneous release of transfer RNA from ribosomes. The 70 S ribosomes released from messenger RNA were further dissociated into their subunits (30 S and 50 S) by the presence of initiation factor three. These ribosomes were biologically active in a MS2 phage RNA-dependent amino acid incorporation system. These observations support the hypothesis that elongation factor G and an additional factor play a role in the process of ribosome run-off from messenger RNA at the end of the cistron or abortively at the middle of the cistron."

https://openalex.org/W1529752367,"Abstract The basement membrane [14C]collagen secreted into the medium by matrix-free lens cells was found to be largely resistent to pepsin at 15°, suggesting that it was in a triple helical conformation. In contrast, [14C]collagen in the lens cells themselves was largely digested by pepsin at 15°, suggesting it was in a random coil form. Gel filtration in sodium dodecyl sulfate showed that the 14C-polypeptides of the collagen in the medium were recovered in aggregates greater than 140,000 daltons when reduction with mercaptoethanol was omitted prior to chromatography. With the cell fraction, essentially all of the [14C]collagen polypeptides were found to elute with molecular weights of 140,000, whether or not reduction with mercaptoethanol was carried out. The observations are consistent with the possibility that the formation of disulfide bonds among the polypeptide chains is of considerable importance in promoting the formation of the triple helix."

https://openalex.org/W1574518545,"Abstract Toluene-treated cells of Escherichia coli represent an in vitro system capable of replicative DNA synthesis. They should offer advantages for investigation of enzymatic mechanisms of DNA repair synthesis secondary to ultraviolet irradiation. The stability of this system allows in vitro irradiation with subsequent measurement of DNA synthesis. Ultraviolet irradiation in vitro causes an inhibition of replicative DNA synthesis in vitro. Moderate levels of such inhibition are due to a decrease in rate of replication rather than an abrupt cessation. Extensive inhibition is followed by the appearance of DNA synthesis that is ATP-dependent and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive, but independent of DNA polymerase I or II activity or DNA replication. The ultraviolet irradiation-stimulated DNA synthesis appears to be dependent upon DNA polymerase III activity."

https://openalex.org/W1573974786,"Abstract The effects of subunit interactions on the function of aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli have been studied by examining possible intermediates during the renaturation of the enzyme from the separated catalytic subunit (c3) and regulatory subunit (r2). When excess r2 is added to a very dilute solution of c3 (1.5 µg per ml or less), a complex is initially formed which, at pH 8.5, differs in kinetic properties from either c3 or the native enzyme (c6r6). Based on the present knowledge concerning the arrangement of subunits in the native structure and consequently the number of c:r domains, we postulate that this complex has a c3r6 structure. Under certain conditions, this complex converts gradually to another species closely resembling the native enzyme. The effects of varying c3 and r2 concentrations on the extent of initial formation of this complex and the rate of its subsequent conversion to the native enzyme are all consistent with the postulated c3r6 structure. This complex shows Michaelis-Menten kinetics and is not inhibited by CTP. It differs from c3 in that Km for aspartate is 6-fold smaller and Vmax is reduced by 30%. The results suggest that the presence of both c3 subunits in the native structure is essential for homotropic and heterotropic interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1562284428,"Abstract An enzyme isolated from Escherichia coli catalyzes the synthesis of polyriboadenylate from ATP in the absence of a RNA primer. The reaction is dependent on the presence of either Mg2+ or Mn2+, 0.8 or 0.2 mm being optimal, respectively. Addition of Mg2+ to reaction mixtures containing optimal concentration of Mn2+ or vice versa results in marked inhibition of the polymerization reaction. Inclusion of KCl in the reaction stimulates the rate of polymerization, the optimum concentration being 0.16 m. The polymerization reaction is not inhibited by RNase or by polyriboadenylate and shows a lag period of 4 to 6 min and then proceeds linearly with time. The lag period can be removed by the addition of fresh enzyme to a reaction mixture inactivated by heat at 4 min. The lag in the polymerization reaction cannot be abolished by the addition of tRNA, DNAs, and oligoadenylates even though these polynucleotides enhanced the reaction rate by 50 to 70%. The increase in activity is not due to the formation of a covalent linkage between the product polyriboadenylate and either tRNA or DNA. The Km for ATP is 1.4 x 10-3 m. Other ribonucleoside triphosphates (UTP, CTP, and GTP) do not serve as substrates. The guanine nucleotides, GTP, dGTP, and GDP, markedly decrease the rate of poly(A) synthesis from ATP while GMP failed to inhibit the reaction."
