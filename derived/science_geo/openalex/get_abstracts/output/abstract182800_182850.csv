https://openalex.org/W2153177211,"Primary rat microglia stimulated with either ATP or 2′- and 3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP) release copious amounts of superoxide (O2⨪). ATP and BzATP stimulate O2⨪ production through purinergic receptors, primarily the P2X7 receptor. O2⨪ is produced through the activation of the NADPH oxidase. Although both p42/44 MAPK and p38 MAPK were activated rapidly in cells stimulated with BzATP, only pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK attenuated O2⨪production. Furthermore, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase attenuated O2⨪ production to a greater extent than an inhibitor of p38 MAPK. Both ATP and BzATP stimulated microglia-induced cortical cell death indicating this pathway may contribute to neurodegeneration. Consistent with this hypothesis, P2X7 receptor was specifically up-regulated around β-amyloid plaques in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (Tg2576).

Microglia are believed to contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 because these cells can release pro-inflammatory substances known to induce neurotoxicity (3Akiyama H. Barger S. Barnum S. Bradt B. Bauer J. Cole G.M. Cooper N.R. Eikelenboom P. Emmerling M. Fiebich B.L. Finch C.E. Frautschy S. Griffin W.S. Hampel H. Hull M. Landreth G. Lue L. Mrak R. Mackenzie I.R. McGeer P.L.

Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs), one of several pro-inflammatory substances released by microglia (4Bianca V.D. Dusi S. Bianchini E. Dal Pra I. Rossi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15493-15499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), are likely to play a very important role in AD because hallmark modifications of ROI damage such as lipid peroxidation and nitrotyrosine conjugates are characteristic of post-mortem AD brains (3Akiyama H. Barger S. Barnum S. Bradt B. Bauer J. Cole G.M. Cooper N.R. Eikelenboom P. Emmerling M. Fiebich B.L. Finch C.E. Frautschy S. Griffin W.S. Hampel H. Hull M. Landreth G. Lue L. Mrak R. Mackenzie I.R.

Hence, pro-inflammatory stimuli that promote microglial ROI production might contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. ATP is an important messenger in the brain and can be released from cells by both lytic and non-lytic mechanisms (5Cunha R.A. Ribeiro J.A. Life Sci. 2000; 68: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). ATP evokes a variety of biological responses in microglia (6Honda S. Sasaki Y. Ohsawa K. Imai Y. Nakamura Y. Inoue K. Kohsaka S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1975-1982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sanz J.M. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4893-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 8Hide I. Tanaka M.

Di Virgilio F. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1295-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The effects of ATP are mediated through interactions with the P2 purinoceptors, broadly classified into P2Y metabotropic and P2X ionotropic receptors (10Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The P2Y receptors are G protein-coupled and P2X receptors are ligand-gated ion channels (10Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Whereas the P2Y receptors are responsible for Ca2+ release predominantly from intracellular stores, P2X receptors are responsible for Ca2+ influx from extracellular sources. Microglia possess both P2Y and P2X receptors (11Kettenmann H. Banati R. Walz W. Glia. 1993; 7: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Norenberg W. Langosch J.M. Gebicke-Haerter P.J.

(Lond.). 1999; 519: 723-736Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The P2X7 receptor is highly expressed by cells of the macrophage lineage, such as dendritic cells, alveolar macrophages, and microglia. Activation of the P2X7 receptor is unique in triggering the formation of large nonselective membrane pores, permeable to molecules up to 900 Da which ultimately results in death of the cell (9Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Dal Susino M. Collo G. Buell G. Di Virgilio F. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1295-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 14Ferrari D. Los M. Bauer M.K. Vandenabeele P. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). ATP and ATP analogs have been used to characterize the role of P2 receptors in microglial activation. Micromolar concentrations of ATP are required to activate the P2Y receptors, whereas millimolar (1–5 mm) concentrations of ATP are required to activate the P2X receptors. The ATP analog BzATP is a selective agonist at the P2X receptor and does not bind P2Y receptors (15Nuttle L.C. el-Moatassim C. Dubyak G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 93-101PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ferrari D. Villalba M. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1531-1539PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidized ATP (oATP) is a specific antagonist of P2X7 that binds irreversibly to the receptor and prevents its activation by ATP (17Murgia M. Hanau S. Pizzo P. Rippa M. Di Virgilio F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8199-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, these pharmacological tools were used to determine the purinergic receptors involved in O2⨪production in microglia. The P2X7 receptor plays a role in the generation of superoxide in microglia. Our studies elucidate a putative signal transduction pathway that mediates this response. These studies also demonstrate that BzATP- and ATP-activated microglia can mediate neurotoxicity. Finally, a distinct alteration was detected in the staining pattern for P2X7 receptor in a transgenic mouse model of AD, suggesting that P2X7 receptor activation could play a contributing role in AD. Reagents not specified otherwise were obtained from Sigma. PD98059, SB203580, LY294002, and DPI were obtained fromBiomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). p38 MAPK and p42/44 MAPK phospho-antibody kits were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). P2X7 and p67phox antibodies were obtained from Pharmingen. Anti-CD45 was purchased from Serotec (Oxford, UK). Amplex red kit and Fluo-4 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Hematoxylin kit obtained from Shandon, Inc. (Pittsburgh, PA). The Tg2576 transgenic mice overexpressing mutant APP (K670N,M671L) and control mice were purchased from the Mayo Clinic (Jacksonville, FL). Rat microglia were prepared from 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups. The rat cortices were separated from meninges and minced, triturated, and centrifuged (200 ×g for 10 min) to remove dead cells. The pellet was resuspended in media and triturated, and two brains were transferred to a 175-mm2 flask containing medium and incubated at 37 °C, 95% relative humidity in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The medium was changed after 3–4 days and twice a week thereafter. Microglia were isolated on day 10 by shaking the flasks on an orbital shaker (VWR Scientific) at 125 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was passed through a sterile nylon mesh (20 μm) (VWR Scientific), and cells were collected by centrifugation (200 ×g for 10 min) and used the same day. The purity of the cultures was 98–100% as determined by immunostaining with ED-40 antibody. Primary cortical cell cultures were prepared from embryos of timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats at E14 (18Parvathenani L.K. Calandra V. Roberts S.B. Posmantur R. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 2293-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cortex triturated in DNase/Protease dissociation buffer was centrifuged and resuspended in PC-1 SF medium (BioWhittaker). The cells (2 × 105/ml) were plated onto poly-l-ornithine-coated 24-well plates, and 4 days later the media were replaced with Neurobasal Medium containing B-27 supplement (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 mml-glutamine. Neuronal cells constituted 90–95% of the total cells and were used on day 10 for experiments. Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy human donors as reported previously (19Parvathenani L.K. Buescher E.S. Chacon-Cruz E. Beebe S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6736-6743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Superoxide (O2⨪) was measured indirectly through the detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by the method of Mohantyet al. (20Mohanty J.G. Jaffe J.S. Schulman E.S. Raible D.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). O2⨪ production was measured in initial experiments by O2⨪-dependent superoxide dismutase-sensitive reduction of ferricytochrome c (21Johnston Jr., R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, microglia released very little O2⨪, and this procedure required a large number of cells. In subsequent experiments the more sensitive method of H2O2 detection using conversion of 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red) to highly fluorescent resorufin in the presence of horseradish peroxidase was followed (20Mohanty J.G. Jaffe J.S. Schulman E.S. Raible D.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105/ml microglia in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) were preincubated with the inhibitors for either 2 (oATP, PPADS) or 1 h (SB203580, PD98059, or LY294002, Brilliant Blue G) or 30 min (DPI, AEBSF, apocyanin) in a 96-well plate. The various stimuli were directly added into the plate containing cells in the presence of 0.2 units/ml horseradish peroxidase, 50 μm Amplex Red, and the change in fluorescence was measured at 590 nm after excitation at 544 nm every 2.5 min using a fluorometric plate reader (Fluostar, BMG Labtechnologies, Durham, NC). The H2O2 released was calculated as picomoles of H2O2, 1 × 105 cells using a standard curve generated using known amounts of H2O2. The conversion of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) to formazan was used to detect the intracellular generation of O2⨪ (21Johnston Jr., R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Patterson C. Ruef J. Madamanchi N.R. Barry-Lane P. Hu Z. Horaist C. Ballinger C.A. Brasier A.R. Bode C. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19814-19822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Briefly, NBT at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml was added to wells containing cells. After treatment, the cells were applied to a glass slide using a Cytospin III (Shandon Southern, Sewickley, PA) and counterstained with safranin. The number of purple granules of formazan was counted microscopically to give a qualitative measure O2⨪generation. Isolated rat microglia were plated onto 384-well plates (Falcon, part 353961) at ∼50% confluence. Cells were loaded with Fluo-4,AM (5 μm) in HBSS containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) for 1 h before the experiment at room temperature and washed with the buffer. ATP and BzATP were used to stimulate the [Ca2+]i signal. In the experiments where oATP and PPADS were used, cells were pretreated with the inhibitors for 2 h at 37 °C and then loaded with Fluo-4,AM. The fluorescent signal from ∼104 cells per well was measured using a fluorometric plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices). Fluo-4 was excited at 488 nm, and fluorescence was measured at 510 nm in a time-resolved mode (1-Hz frequency). Relativef/f0 intensity (in counts/ms) was used as an indication of [Ca2+]i signal. Data acquisition and preliminary analysis were done using FLIPR software (Molecular Devices). All calcium measurements were done at room temperature. Fractionation of microglia was performed according to the method of Zhao et al. (23Zhao X. Bey E.A. Wientjes F.B. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25385-25392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, microglia (14 × 106 cells/ml) in HBSS were treated with or without 500 μm BzATP for 5–10 min. Cells were centrifuged, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of relaxation buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm EGTA, 10 mm PIPES (pH 7.3), 500 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture), sonicated (3 × 10 s, 4 °C using a microprobe sonicator), and centrifuged (500 × g for 10 min) to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The post-nuclear lysates were then ultracentrifuged (100,000 × g for 60 min, 4 °C), and the resulting supernatant was designated the cytosolic fraction. The membrane/particulate pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of relaxation buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay, and 25 μg of protein (for both the cytosolic and membrane/particulate fraction) was loaded onto a gel. A spontaneously occurring rat microglial cell line was used for the above experiment because we were unable to generate sufficient numbers of primary microglia required for this experiment. The spontaneously occurring rat microglial cell line was isolated from primary rat microglia growing in LADMAC-conditioned media (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The cells were propagated in media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 10% fetal bovine serum) containing 20% LADMAC-conditioned media. The cells were positive for ED-1, a microglial marker. The microglial cells responded to both LPS and BzATP as demonstrated by the generation of TNFα with LPS and ROIs with BzATP (data not shown). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (18Parvathenani L.K. Calandra V. Roberts S.B. Posmantur R. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 2293-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly 25 μg of protein was fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blocked in 5% milk/Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h. The membrane were washed and incubated overnight with antibodies specific for phospho-p42/44 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182) diluted 1:1000 in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000) for 2 h. The membrane was washed extensively, and bands were detected using LumiGLO. The membranes were stripped using RESTORE Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce), washed several times, and blocked for 1 h. Membranes were incubated with antibodies specific for either unphosphorylated p42/44 MAPK or p38 MAPK diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer. The next day membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody and visualized using LumiGLO. The P2X7 (1:500), p67phox (1:500), and actin (1:750) antibodies were used according to the manufacturer's recommendation. In some experiments a P2X7 control peptide corresponding to amino acid 576–595 of rat P2X7 (the immunogen used to generate the antibody) was utilized to determine specificity of the bands. The P2X7 antibody was preincubated with the control peptide at a 1:1 dilution (v/v) for 1 h at room temperature prior to the addition to the membrane. Primary rat microglia (1 × 105) in Neurobasal Medium containing B-27, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 mml-glutamine were seeded into a 48-well plate containing 1 × 105primary cortical neurons. The cells were allowed to settle for 2 h prior to the addition of stimuli. After a 72-h incubation, the supernatant was assayed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Microglia and cortical cells were also independently cultured for 72 h in the presence of stimuli, and LDH released from microglia alone ± stimuli were subtracted out from the values obtained from the combination of microglia and cortical neurons. The LDH was measured with a commercial kit obtained from Promega (WI). In one experiment a WST-1 cell survival assay was performed on the cells remaining in the well with a commercial kit obtained from Roche Diagnostics. WST-1 is a modified 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium assay. The WST-1 assay enables colorimetric measurement of cell viability based on the cleavage of tetrazolium salts by mitochondrial dehydrogenase in viable cells. Supernatants were assayed for TNFα using OPtEIA Rat TNFα kit (Pharmingen). Nitrite assay was performed in a 96-well plate using modified Griess Reagent. In brief, 100 μl of Griess Reagent was added to 100 μl of supernatant in a 96-well plate. Samples were read at 540 nm, and values were calculated against a sodium nitrite standard curve. The mice were sedated, perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and decapitated. The brains (2-year Tg2576 mice and aged-matched controls) were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were dehydrated in graded alcohol solutions followed by Histoclear and embedded in paraffin. Longitudinal serial sections were cut at 6-μm thickness. The sections were deparaffinized in Histoclear, rehydrated through a series of graded alcohols, washed in deionized water, and incubated in 1:5 methanol/water solution containing 3% H2O2for 30 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. The slides were rinsed in deionized water for 5 min followed by blocking in 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% Triton-X-100 for 1 h. Sections were incubated with primary antibody (Pan A-β 1:1000 (QCB), 4G8 1:1000 (Signet), P2X7 1:100 (Pharmingen), CD45 1:200 (Serotec), or GFAP 1:1000 (Chemicon)) in 1% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Immunohistochemistry was completed with appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (1:500) in 2% normal goat serum/phosphate-buffered saline followed by avidin-biotin complex and visualized by diaminobenzidine development (Vector Laboratories). Primary or secondary antibodies were omitted from some sections to serve as negative controls. After the enzyme substrate (Vector Laboratories) was added, the manufacturer's protocol was followed. The slides were washed in water and counter-stained with Shandon-Lippshaw hematoxylin stain for 2 min at room temperature. Sections were washed in water for 1 min, incubated for 10 s in 50% ethanol/ H2O + 1% HCl to remove residual hematoxylin, and then washed in water for 1 min. The slides were then dehydrated in a series of alcohol washes and sealed with a coverslip using DPX mounting medium. Immunofluorescence was used to detect dual antigen labeling. Tissue sections were deparaffinized via a series of xylenes and alcohols. Sections were blocked in 10% donkey serum for 1 h and then incubated in primary antibodies using 1% serum in Tris-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies (1:1000) specific for GFAP and P2X7 were pooled for dual immunofluorescence. Slides were then incubated in pooled secondary antibodies using donkey anti-mouse Cy-2 (1:100) and donkey anti-rabbit Cy-3 (1:400) in 2% normal donkey serum in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h in the dark. Slides were mounted and coverslip sealed with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were captured using a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV microscope with the Zeiss KS400 imaging system. Hippocampi from Tg2576 mice and age-matched controls (19 months, 1 male and 2 female) were excised and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Tissues were homogenized for 20 s on ice in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl) at 20% weight/volume using a Polytron homogenizer. Samples were then diluted 1:1 in TNE buffer containing 2% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% deoxycholate, and sonicated (2 × 15 s, 4 °C). Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay, and 25 μg of protein from each hippocampus was loaded onto a gel. Student's t test was performed to determine group differences (p < 0.05). Primary rat microglia stimulated with ATP and BzATP rapidly generate ROIs, superoxide (O2⨪) in particular, measured indirectly as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Fig.1 shows time- and dose-response curves of H2O2 generated by microglia stimulated with ATP or BzATP. The response to ATP was maximal at 1 mm. The production of H2O2 continued slowly for at least 90 min after stimulation. The H2O2production by microglia stimulated with BzATP was rapid and peaked by about 30 min. The maximal stimulus was ∼250 μm. The magnitude of the response was higher in cells treated with BzATP compared with ATP. The total amount of H2O2produced (picomoles) with stimulation by ATP and BzATP was lower than that generated by 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). However at early time points (5 min) 250 μm BzATP generated 9–10-fold more H2O2 than PMA (Fig.1C). These results demonstrate there is a distinct difference in both the magnitude and duration of H2O2 production depending on the stimulus. The conversion of Amplex Red to highly fluorescent resorufin in the presence of H2O2 is an indirect measure of O2⨪ generation. Hence the production of O2⨪ was confirmed by a more direct but less sensitive method. The inhibition of reduction of ferricytochrome c by O2⨪-dependent superoxide dismutase was used to detect the generation of O2⨪. As shown in Fig. 1D, microglia treated with BzATP showed a significant increase in superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochromec compared with untreated microglia. O2⨪ production by neutrophils treated with BzATP was examined as a control. Similar increases in O2⨪ were observed when neutrophils were stimulated with BzATP suggesting that BzATP activates a similar cascade in neutrophils (Fig. 1E). To determine whether BzATP generated any intracellular O2⨪, the reduction of NBT in neutrophils treated with BzATP was examined. In neutrophils treated with BzATP or PMA but not control cells, formations of purple granules of formazan were visible microscopically indicating that NBT was being reduced to formazan (data not shown). These results confirm that cells stimulated with BzATP generate O2⨪. Because microglia produce little O2⨪, the conversion of Amplex Red to highly fluorescent resorufin, a more sensitive but indirect indicator of O2⨪production (20Mohanty J.G. Jaffe J.S. Schulman E.S. Raible D.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), was used as the choice reagent in the remaining experiments. Treatment of microglia with ATP or BzATP resulted in a very rapid increase in the level of intracellular calcium (Fig. 2). ATP stimulated a transient increase of intracellular calcium (Fig.2A). BzATP caused a sustained increase in the level of intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) that was maintained for more than 6 min (Fig. 2B). The concentration of ATP or BzATP required for maximal [Ca2+]ichange was lower than required for maximal H2O2production. Maximal [Ca2+]i changes were stimulated by 30–100 μm of both ATP and BzATP, whereas maximal ROI production required 1 mm ATP and 250μm BzATP (Figs. 1 and 2). To determine whether ATP and BzATP were mobilizing intracellular or extracellular sources of Ca2+ or both, additional experiments were carried out in Ca2+-free media containing 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (Ca2+ chelator). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the BzATP response was completely blocked indicating that BzATP was mobilizing only extracellular Ca2+ (Fig.2C). However, with ATP, the initial transient peak was reduced by about 75%, suggesting that ATP mobilizes both intracellular (via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release) and extracellular sources of Ca2+ (possibly via capacitative Ca2+ influx) (24Toescu E.C.

Because ATP appeared to stimulate Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and Ca2+ influx from extracellular sources, whereas BzATP appeared to stimulate only Ca2+ influx from extracellular sources, the effect of removal of extracellular Ca2+ on H2O2 production was examined. Both ATP- and BzATP-stimulated H2O2production was blocked to below control levels in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3). These results suggest that despite the differences in Ca2+mobilization, both ATP and BzATP required only extracellular Ca2+ to generate H2O2. The ability of BzATP, an agonist of P2X receptors, to stimulate H2O2 production and the requirement of extracellular Ca2+ for this response suggest P2X receptors mediate the production of H2O2 in microglia. To determine whether the production of H2O2 was mediated through the P2X7 receptor, two selective inhibitors of P2X7, PPADS and oATP, were tested. Both PPADS and oATP blocked H2O2 production by BzATP treatment (Fig. 4A) suggesting that BzATP activates H2O2 production primarily through the P2X7 receptor. Further support for the role of P2X7 in H2O2 production was obtained by treating cells with Brilliant Blue G, a potent and highly selective inhibitor of P2X7, at nanomolar concentrations (26Jiang L.H. Mackenzie A.B. North R.A. Surprenant A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Brilliant Blue G (500 nm) inhibited BzATP (250 μm)-induced H2O2 production by more than 80% (Fig. 4A). To determine whether oATP and PPADS affected Ca2+ responses similarly, Ca2+ changes were measured in cells pretreated with oATP and PPADS in the presence or absence of BzATP. oATP (100 μm) inhibited BzATP-induced Ca2+ flux to near control levels (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained with PPADS (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that P2X7is the primary receptor stimulated by BzATP to generate H2O2. Several sources can contribute to the production of ROI. These include the classical NADPH oxidase, the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and microsomal enzymes. Pharmacological inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase were used to determine whether P2X7 receptor activates NADPH oxidase. Three selective inhibitors with different mechanisms of action, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), apocyanin, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) were used (27Stolk J.

As shown in Fig. 5A, all three inhibitors completely inhibited BzATP-induced H2O2 release from microglia. To confirm the activation of NADPH oxidase by BzATP in microglia, a functional change in NADPH oxidase was examined. A critical step in the activation of the NADPH oxidase is the translocation of p67phox from the cytosol to the membrane. In BzATP-stimulated microglia, p67phox, which is primarily c"

Recent studies suggest that aggregated proteins cause toxicity by inhibiting the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal system. In the present study, we explore how α-synuclein interacts with the proteasome. The proteasome exists as a 26 S and a 20 S species. The 26 S proteasome is composed of the 19 S cap and the 20 S core. Aggregated α-synuclein strongly inhibited the function of the 26 S proteasome. The IC50 of aggregated α-synuclein for ubiquitin-independent 26 S proteasomal activity was 1 nm. Aggregated α-synuclein also inhibited 26 S ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal activity at a dose of 500 nm. In contrast, the IC50 of aggregated α-synuclein for 20 S proteasomal activity was > 1 ॖm. This suggests that aggregated α-synuclein selectively interacts with the 19 S cap. Monomeric α-synuclein also inhibited proteasomal activity but with lower affinity and less potency. Recombinant monomeric α-synuclein inhibited the activity of the 20 S proteasomal core with an IC50 > 10 ॖm, exhibited no inhibition of 26 S ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal activity at doses up to 5 ॖm, and exhibited only partial inhibition (507) of the 26 S ubiquitin-independent proteasomal activity at doses up to 10 mm. Binding studies demonstrate that both aggregated and monomeric α-synuclein selectively bind to the proteasomal protein S6′, a subunit of the 19 S cap. These studies suggest that proteasomal inhibition by aggregated α-synuclein could be mediated by interaction with S6′.

Parkinson's disease dihydrofolate reductase dihidrofolate reductase with a degradation tag ubiquitin proteasomal system A multisubunit complex, termed the proteasome, manages protein turnover in the body. Proteins can be either degraded directly by the proteasome, or they can be tagged with an 8-KDprotein, termed ubiquitin. Three different forms of the proteasome exist in a cell: the 20 S ubiquitin-independent proteasome, the 26 S ubiquitin-independent proteasome, and the 26 S ubiquitin-dependent proteasome. The 20 S particle forms the core of each form of proteasome (1Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Google Scholar, 2Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Google Scholar). Both the 26 S ubiquitin-dependent and -independent proteasomes contain the 20 S particle plus an additional smaller cap, which has a sedimentation coefficient of 19 S. Although smaller than the 20 S particle, the 19 S particle is also a multisubunit structure. The protein subunits that compose the 19 and 20 S particles are all known. The 19 S cap contains at least 18 different subunits, whereas the 20 S particle contains 28 subunits (1Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Google Scholar, 2Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Google Scholar). The protein S6′ (also known as tat binding protein 1 and Rpt5) is in the 19 S cap and is of particular interest because it was recently shown to directly bind ubiquitinated proteins, which suggests that it is required for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal function (3Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Google Scholar). Although the 26 S proteasome is responsible in both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent protein degradation (4Davies K.J. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 301-310Google Scholar, 5Shringarpure R. Grune T. Davies K.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1442-1450Google Scholar), the 20 S proteasome functions only in ubiquitin-independent protein degradation and is involved in 70–807 of the selective recognition and degradation of mildly oxidized proteins in the cytosol (4Davies K.J. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 301-310Google Scholar, 5Shringarpure R. Grune T. Davies K.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1442-1450Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent pathway degrades all ubiquitinated proteins within the cell and is the primary degradation pathway of the cell. The E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme forms a thiodiester bond with mono-ubiquitin. The E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme displaces the E1 enzyme and allows for conjugation of multiple ubiquitin moieties with one another. The E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme binds both to the substrate targeted for degradation and to the E2 enzyme. The E2 and E3 enzymes are displaced, leaving a multichained ubiquitinated substrate protein that is targeted to the 26 S proteasome. This is both an ATP- and ubiquitin-dependent pathway (6Rechsteiner M. Cell. 1991; 66: 615-618Google Scholar, 7Rechsteiner M. Hoffman L. Dubiel W. J. Biol.

Recent studies suggest that protein aggregates cause toxicity by inhibiting proteasomal function. Extended polyglutamine repeats, such as occur in mutant forms of huntingtin associated with Huntington's disease, aggregate readily (14Satyal S.H. Schmidt E. Kitagawa K. Sondheimer N. Lindquist S.

Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Google Scholar). Aggregates of other proteins, such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor, also inhibit ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal function in cell culture (17Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Google Scholar). Many other proteins with hydrophobic domains also aggregate, and overexpressing the aggregation-prone domains of these proteins is toxic (18Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Google Scholar). The mechanism of toxicity for most aggregates is unknown. Blockade of proteasome activity is toxic to many cell types and appears to be potentially important to many neurodegenerative diseases. Proteasomal inhibition causes apoptosis in many cell lines and is being tested as a potential chemotherapy (19Jesenberger V. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 112-121Google Scholar). Although proteasomal inhibition causes rapid toxicity in cell culture, the slow accumulation of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases might produce a correspondingly slow inhibition of the proteasome. α-Synuclein is the major component of Lewy bodies, which are intracellular inclusions that form in Parkinson's disease (PD)1 (20Spillantini M. Schmidt M. Lee VM-Y Trojanowski J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Google Scholar, 21Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Google Scholar). The association of α-synuclein with Lewy bodies suggests that protein aggregation represents an important aspect of the pathophysiology of α-synuclein and of PD. The link between α-synuclein and protein aggregation has been strengthened by the discovery of mutant forms of α-synuclein, A53T and A30P, that are associated with rare cases of familial PD (22Polymeropoulos M.H.

The link between α-synuclein and aggregation suggests that understanding the mechanism of toxicity induced by protein aggregates could provide important insights into the mechanism of cell death in PD. Native α-synuclein has been shown to bind both fatty acids and many different proteins, including phospholipase D, G proteins, synphilin-1, protein kinase C, 14–3-3 protein, parkin, and the dopamine transporter (28Ostrerova N.

In addition, rat α-synuclein has been shown to bind to rat S6′ (35Ghee M. Fournier A. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2221-2224Google Scholar). Of these proteins, only synphilin-1 and parkin have been identified in Lewy bodies (33Choi P. Golts N. Snyder H. Petrucelli L. Chong M. Hardy J. Sparkman D. Cochran E. Lee J. Wolozin B.

Perhaps because of the pleiotropic binding properties of native α-synuclein, overexpressing it in cells produces multiple cellular effects. α-Synuclein inhibits protein kinase C activity, phospholipase D activity, and the activity of the dopamine transporter, and α-synuclein has chaperone activity (28Ostrerova N.

Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 919-926Google Scholar). The link between α-synuclein and the proteasome is intriguing but is not directly related to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, because overexpressed α-synuclein retains a native structure until the cell is subjected to a stress, such as incubation with rotenone or ferrous chloride (40Ostrerova-Golts N.

Thus, whether aggregated α-synuclein inhibits proteasomal function is unknown, and the mechanism by which it might inhibit the proteasome is also unknown. In this study we examine the interaction of α-synuclein with the three different types of proteasome and demonstrate that aggregated α-synuclein binds to S6′ and inhibits ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal function. The human cell line HEK 293 and the human neuroblastoma cell line BE-M17 were grown in OPTIMEM (Cell Grow) plus 107 fetal bovine serum supplemented with 200 ॖg/ml G418 (Sigma), as needed. G418 was used for selection. Transfections utilized FuGENE at a 3:1 ratio to DNA, 4 ॖg per 10-cm dish. Recombinant α-synuclein was generated using wild-type α-synuclein inserted into a ProEX-His6 plasmid (Invitrogen) as described previously (41Golts N. Snyder H. Frasier M. Theisler C. Choi P. Wolozin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16116-16123Google Scholar). Antibodies used include monoclonal anti-α-synuclein (1:1000 IB, Transduction Labs); polyclonal anti-S6′ (1:1000, Affiniti); monoclonal anti-S6′ (1:1000, Affiniti); polyclonal anti-PA700 (1:1000, Affiniti); monoclonal anti-10b (1:1000, Affiniti); polyclonal anti-α subunit 20 S (1:1000, Affiniti); and polyclonal anti-α-synuclein (against amino acids 116–131, 1:1000). Brain samples were precleared with nickel-agarose for one hour at 4 °C to eliminate proteins that directly bind to nickel-agarose (Invitrogen). These samples were incubated overnight with 5 ॖg of recombinant α-synuclein (His-tagged), either aggregated or monomeric. Samples were incubated with nickel-agarose for one hour to allow binding of the His-tagged α-synuclein (monomeric or aggregated), and then they were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min. Samples were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.57 Triton-X, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), pH 7.4) and run on 8–167 SDS gradient polyacrylamide gels (BioWhitaker). Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay (Pierce), and 500 ॖg of each sample was used per immunoprecipitation in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EGTA, 100 mmNaCl, 0.57 Triton-X, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmproteasome inhibitor mixture (Sigma), pH7.4). Samples were precleared using protein G-Sepharose beads (Seize X, Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C and incubated with antibody overnight at 4 °C while rocking. Samples were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, resuspended in 2× dithiothreitol protein loading buffer, boiled for 5 min at 90 °C, and run on 8–167 SDS gradient polyacrylamide gels (BioWhitaker). Recombinant α-synuclein incubated for 2 months at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline while shaking at 800 rpm; aggregation was confirmed by performing immunoblot analysis. Transfers to polyvinylidene difluoride (BioRad) were done overnight at 4 °C at 0.1 A/gel in transfer buffer. The immunoblot was blocked in 0.27 I-block (Tropix) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.17 Tween 20 for one hour at room temperature while shaking. We then incubated blots overnight at 4 °C in primary antibody at appropriate concentration in 57 bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline/0.17 Triton X-100. Blots were washed three times, 10 min each, and incubated three hours in secondary antibody (1:5000, Jackson Laboratories) in I-block at room temperature. Blots were washed three times and developed using a chemiluminescent reaction (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 10–307 linear sucrose gradients were prepared using Hoefer SG 15 gradient maker (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Approximately 10 mg of monomeric or aggregated α-synuclein, as determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce), was added to the top of the gradient; they were centrifuged using a SW41 rotor for 16 ½ hours at 40,000 rpm at 20 °C. After centrifugation, 0.5-ml fractions were collected; 20 ॖl of each fraction was run on an 8–167 gradient gel, and immunoblotted. We incubated aggregated or monomeric α-synuclein at various concentrations with purified 20 S proteasome (human erythrocytes, BioMol) for 30 min and then added a fluorogenic substrate (Suc-LLVY-AMC, BioMol). Ten minutes later, the samples were analyzed with a GeminiXS SpectraMax fluorescent spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences) using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Aggregated or monomeric α-synuclein at various concentrations was incubated with 250 ॖg of HEK 293 cell lysates, as determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce) in assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm ATP) for 30 or 60 min at 37 °C while shaking at 800 rpm. We then added a fluorogenic substrate (Suc-LLVY-AMC, BioMol) and incubated samples an additional 30 min at 37 °C while shaking at 800 rpm. Solutions were analyzed using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm with the GeminiXS SpectraMax spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). Substrates were generated with an in vitro transcription and translation of substrate proteins using a T7 promoter in Escherichia coli lysate (Promega), supplemented with [35S]methionine, and then partially purified by high-speed centrifugation and ammonium sulfate precipitation as described (45Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Google Scholar). The protease substrate for ClP assays was derived from barnase, which is a ribonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; the protease substrate for proteasomal assays was derived from E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (45Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Google Scholar,46Matouschek A. Azem A. Ratliff K. Glick B.S. Schmid K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6727-6736Google Scholar). A ubiquitin moiety was added to the N terminus of the substrate proteins via a 4-amino acid linker from the E. coli lac repressor (45Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Google Scholar). Substrate proteins were constructed in pGEM-3Zf (+) vectors (Promega) and were verified by sequencing. The reaction was resuspended in 40 ॖl of buffer (257 (v/v) glycerol, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm Tris/HCl, pH7.4) to which 5 ॖl of the in vitro reaction containing the radiolabeled ubiquitinated substrate protein was added with 35 ॖl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Green Hectares, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol) that is ATP-depleted as described (45Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Google Scholar). We incubated the reactions with and without monomeric or aggregated α-synuclein. Concentration of α-synuclein was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). We incubated at 37 °C for 7 min to allow initial cleavage of substrate proteins. Ubiquitination and degradation was initiated by the addition of ATP and an ATP-regenerating system (0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, final concentrations). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C. At designated time points (15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min), small aliquots were removed and transferred to ice-cold 57 trichloroacetic acid. The trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fractions were analyzed by 107 SDS-PAGE and quantified by electronic autoradiography. All statistics were performed using a multifactorial analysis of variance analysis using the Statview statistical package. To begin analyzing how α-synuclein might interact with the proteasome, wild-type α-synuclein was stably expressed in human neuroblastoma BE-M17 cells by transient transfection, and ubiquitin-dependent and -independent proteasomal activity was quantified. Because α-synuclein does not form aggregates spontaneously under these conditions, this experiment addresses whether increased concentration of cellular α-synuclein inhibits proteasomal activity. Immunoblotting of the cellular lysates demonstrated a significant increase in the α-synuclein levels in the transfected cells (Fig. 1A). Next, we investigated whether overexpressing α-synuclein affects the steady state levels of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, which provides a measure of the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal system. The BE-M17 cells expressing vector or wild-type α-synuclein were immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin antibody. The amount of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins did not differ among the groups of transfected cells (Fig. 1,B and C). We also investigated how overexpressing α-synuclein affects ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation. Previous studies report that cell lines overexpressing α-synuclein exhibit lower ubiquitin-independent proteasomal activity (39Tanaka Y. Engelender S. Igarashi S. Rao R.K. Wanner T. Tanzi R.E. Sawa A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 919-926Google Scholar). To investigate ubiquitin-independent proteasomal activity, we measured hydrolysis rates of fluorogenic peptide analogues in cells transiently or stably overexpressing α-synuclein (Fig. 1D). No difference in activity was observed in cells transiently transfected with α-synuclein (data not shown). However, cell lines stably expressing wild-type α-synuclein showed an approximately 507 reduction in ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation, depending on the transgene (39Tanaka Y. Engelender S. Igarashi S. Rao R.K. Wanner T. Tanzi R.E. Sawa A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 919-926Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that α-synuclein does affect ubiquitin-independent proteasomal function. An increasing number of studies suggest that the state of α-synuclein aggregation plays a key role in the pathophysiology of PD. To better understand how α-synuclein affects the proteasome, we generated recombinant monomeric α-synuclein and aggregated α-synuclein. The aggregated α-synuclein was generated by aging recombinant α-synuclein at 37 °C for 2 months. Aggregation of α-synuclein was verified by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2A). The aggregated protein ran as a smear with an average molecular weight of ∼160,000 (Fig. 2A). The immunoblot of the aged, aggregated α-synuclein also exhibited some reactivity at 16,000. This could reflect either that the sample had some non-aggregated, monomeric α-synuclein remaining or that some of the α-synuclein could be dissociated from the aggregate by SDS. To examine this question, we fractionated monomeric or aged α-synuclein (37 °C for 2 months) by centrifugation in a sucrose gradient and immunoblotted each of the 25 fractions with anti-synuclein antibody. The initial sample used before the fractionation is shown in the first lane (Fig. 2B, labeled In). Monomeric α-synuclein had a low density and was most abundant in fractions 1–6 (Fig. 2B,top). In contrast, the aggregated α-synuclein sample showed nothing in the early fractions (corresponding to a low density) and migrated exclusively in the last fraction, suggesting a high density (Fig. 2B, fraction 25,bottom). Immunoblots of fraction 25 for the aggregated sample showed a small amount of SDS-sensitive α-synuclein that migrated as a monomer following exposure to SDS during the immunoblotting. This SDS-dissociable α-synuclein was particularly evident following longer exposures (Fig. 2B, fraction 25B, bottom). This suggests that aggregated α-synuclein contains SDS-sensitive and SDS-resistant aggregated protein. Next, we examined the activity of purified 20 S proteasome particles in the presence of varying amounts of monomeric or aggregated α-synuclein using synthetic fluorescent peptides to monitor proteasomal activity. Increasing doses of monomeric α-synuclein progressively inhibited proteasomal activity (Fig.3A). The IC50 for inhibition of the proteasome by monomeric α-synuclein was ∼16 ॖm, assuming α-synuclein could achieve complete inhibition. Aggregated α-synuclein also inhibited the 20 S ubiquitin-independent proteasomal activity, exhibiting a maximal inhibition similar to that of monomeric α-synuclein (Fig.3B). To determine whether the inhibition was at the level of the proteasome or due to binding of the peptide substrate, we examined whether varying the level of substrate affected the α-synuclein-dependent proteasomal inhibition. Inhibition of the 20 S proteasome by monomeric α-synuclein increased with increasing substrate concentration (Fig.3C). Increased proteasomal inhibition by α-synuclein might occur because larger effects are possible at higher rates of substrate degradation. These data indicate that the proteasomal inhibition that was observed did not result from substrate binding and substrate sequestration by α-synuclein. Thus, α-synuclein appears to inhibit the proteasomal activity via an interaction with the proteasome, rather than by binding substrate peptide. Next, we examined the effects of monomeric and aggregated α-synuclein on a mixture of the 20 and 26 S proteasomes in HEK 293 cell lysates. Monomeric α-synuclein inhibited the 20 S/26 S proteasome mixture only partially, which could reflect greater inhibition of the 20 S proteasome complex and less inhibition of the 26 S proteasome complex (Fig. 4B). The concentration producing maximal inhibition of the 20 S/26 S proteasome complex was similar to that seen for the 20 S proteasome complex (> 10 ॖm), based on 507 maximal inhibition (Fig.4B). Aggregated α-synuclein also inhibited the 20 S/26 S ubiquitin-independent proteasomal mixture. Based on an estimated molecular weight for aggregated α-synuclein of 160,000, we calculated that the IC50 of aggregated α-synuclein for the 20 S/26 S proteasome was 1 nm (Fig. 4A). The ability of aggregated α-synuclein to inhibit a mixture of the 26 S and 20 S proteasomes, but not the 20 S proteasome, suggests that aggregated α-synuclein selectively inhibits the 26 S proteasome. The greater ability of aggregated α-synuclein compared with monomeric α-synuclein in inhibiting 26 S ubiquitin-independent proteasomal activity raises the possibility that 26 S ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal function might also be selectively inhibited by aggregated α-synuclein. To investigate this, we examined ubiquitin-mediated degradation of a fusion protein made up of barnase and E. coli dihydrofolate reductase that had been fused with an N-terminal degradation tag (DHFR-U) (45Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Google Scholar). Prior studies show that degradation of ubiquitinated DHFR-U by reticulocyte lysates is mediated by the 26 S proteasome (45Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Google Scholar). We used this system to investigate how monomeric and aggregated α-synuclein affect ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Degradation of ubiquitinated DHFR-U was examined in the presence of monomeric or aggregated α-synuclein (Fig.5A). The half-life of DHFR-U was 125 min both under basal conditions and in the presence of 5 ॖm monomeric α-synuclein (Fig. 5A,gray bars). However, the half-life of DHFR-U greatly increased in the presence of 500 nm aggregated α-synuclein (Fig. 5A, dotted bars). No inhibition was seen with 50 nm aggregated α-synuclein (data not shown). These data indicate that 26 S ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation is selectively inhibited by aggregated α-synuclein. To determine whether inhibition of ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation was specific to the 26 S proteasome, we also examined degradation of barnase that had been fused with a 65-amino acid N-terminal tag (DHFR-65) that allows the protein to be recognized and degraded by the bacterial proteasomal analog ClpAP (45Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Google Scholar). DHFR-65 was incubated with ClpAP alone or in the presence of 5 ॖmmonomeric α-synuclein or in the presence of 500 nmaggregated α-synuclein, and the rate of degradation was monitored. Neither monomeric nor aggregated α-synuclein inhibited degradation of DHFR-65 by ClpAP (Fig. 5B). This indicates that proteasomal inhibition by aggregated α-synuclein is specific for the ubiquitin-dependent 26 S proteasomal system. The ability of aggregated α-synuclein to inhibit degradation mediated by the 26 S proteasome could be explained by interaction between aggregated α-synuclein and a protein in the 19 S cap that is present in the 26 S proteasome but not the 20 S proteasome. Studies with rat α-synuclein suggest that α-synuclein binds the rodent 19 S proteasomal component S6′ (35Ghee M. Fournier A. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2221-2224Google Scholar). Based on this work, we investigated whether human α-synuclein interacts with S6′. His-tagged recombinant native or aggregated α-synuclein was incubated overnight with substantia nigra or cingulated cortex from normal human brain and then precipitated with nickel-agarose. The precipitates were immunoblotted with antibodies to S6′. A representative immunoblot with native α-synuclein is shown in Fig. 6A, and a pull-down with native or aggregated α-synuclein is shown in Fig. 6B. Both aggregated and monomeric α-synuclein associated with S6′. The term ‘native’ is used in this discussion because the overnight incubation of recombinant α-synuclein with the lysates appeared to promote formation of some recombinant α-synuclein dimer, in addition to the more abundant α-synuclein monomer (Fig. 6B,lower panel). Co-association of α-synuclein with S6′ was also observed by immunoprecipitating endogenous α-synuclein and immunoblotting for S6′ (Fig. 6C). To test the selectivity of the association, we examined whether α-synuclein binds other components of the 19 S proteasomal cap, such as Rpn12 and subunit 10b. Neither Rpn12 nor subunit 10b was observed to co-precipitate with α-synuclein (Fig. 6D, immunoblot for 10bshown). It was not possible to test the association of S6′ with α-synuclein by immunoprecipitating S6′, because none of the antibodies to S6′ that we tested were successfully able to precipitate S6′ (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that both monomeric and aggregated α-synuclein bind S6′. Proteasomal inhibition is known to be toxic to many cell types and is thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases (17Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Google Scholar, 18Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Google Scholar, 47Johnston J. Ward C. Kopito R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that overexpressing α-synuclein inhibits 20 and 26 S proteasomal activity. The relationship between overexpressed α-synuclein and the pathophysiology of PD, though, is unclear. Overexpressing α-synuclein in mammalian neurons does not lead to its spontaneous aggregation, except after delays of 6–12 months (48Lee M.K. Stirling W. Xu Y. Xu X. Qui D. Mandir A.S. Dawson T.M.

Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Google Scholar). Because protein aggregation is thought to play a critical role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and aggregation of α-synuclein appears to be important to the pathophysiology of PD, we sought to design experiments that would allow analysis of the actions of aggregated α-synuclein. To investigate whether aggregated α-synuclein interacts with the proteasome, we examined the behavior of α-synuclein that had been aggregated in vitro. We observed that aggregated α-synuclein inhibits both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent 26 S proteasomal activity. The IC50 of aggregated α-synuclein for ubiquitin-independent 26 S proteasomal activity was 1 nm, which was over 1000-fold higher than the IC50 for 20 S proteasomal activity. In contrast, monomeric α-synuclein inhibited 20 and 26 S proteasomal activity with an IC50 > 10 ॖm. The high affinity of aggregated α-synuclein for inhibiting 26 S proteasomal activity could be explained by binding of aggregated α-synuclein to a protein in the 19 S cap, which is the proteasomal complex that binds to the 20 S proteasome and confers ubiquitin-dependence, as discussed below (3Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that α-synuclein binds to S6′, which is a subunit of the 19 S cap that was recently shown to bind polyubiquitinated proteins (3Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Google Scholar). Both aggregated and monomeric α-synuclein bind the S6′ protein. The interaction appears to be selective for S6′ because no association was observed with other 19 S proteasomal proteins, such as Rpn12 or subunit 10b. Binding of α-synuclein to S6′ is consistent with prior publications. Ghee et al. (35Ghee M. Fournier A. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2221-2224Google Scholar) demonstrated that rat S6′ (also termed Tat binding protein-1, TBP1) binds α-synuclein using the yeast two-hybrid method. The association was confirmed by showing that an epitope-tagged S6′ could pull down α-synuclein following transfection of both proteins into HEK 293 cells. However, this study did not demonstrate interaction using the endogenous proteins and also did not investigate whether human α-synuclein binds to human S6′. In addition, Iiet al. (52Ii K. Ito H. Tanaka K. Hirano A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 125-131Google Scholar) have documented the presence of proteasomal proteins in Lewy bodies, which supports our observation that aggregated α-synuclein binds S6′. The information presented in this study provides the functional relevance for these observations by showing that binding of α-synuclein to the proteasome inhibits proteasomal function. The function of S6′ was recently identified and suggests a mechanism explaining why aggregated α-synuclein might inhibit the activity of the 26 S proteasome. The S6′ protein appears to function in the 19 S proteasomal cap as the docking protein for ubiquitin-conjugated proteins and is essential for binding of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins by the proteasome (3Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Google Scholar). Because aggregated α-synuclein is much larger than monomeric α-synuclein and often contains covalent cross-links, binding to S6′ might inhibit the function of the 19 S protein by competing with binding of other ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Bound aggregated α-synuclein might occupy the unfolding proteins associated with proteasomal degradation, and the aggregate might also physically block the pore of the 19 S cap. This model provides an explanation for the ability of aggregated α-synuclein to interfere with both the ubiquitin-dependent and -independent 26 S proteasomal function. Many other protein aggregates have been shown to be toxic to cells (18Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Google Scholar). Both aggregated cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor and polyglutamine repeat exhibit toxicity that correlates with proteasomal inhibition (17Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Google Scholar, 18Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M.

This study focuses attention on the interaction between S6′ and protein aggregates. Whether S6′ has a particular affinity for α-synuclein or is a general target for all protein aggregates remains to be determined. Inhibiting the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal system (UPS) is known to be toxic, perhaps because it induces apoptosis (19Jesenberger V. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 112-121Google Scholar). Inhibiting the UPS causes the accumulation of many toxic proteins, such as Pael-R, which was recently identified as a parkin substrate (53Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi Y. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Google Scholar). Inhibiting the UPS is also known to cause the accumulation of protein aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum (17Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Google Scholar, 47Johnston J. Ward C. Kopito R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Google Scholar). Inhibiting the UPS could alter the regulation of cell cycle proteins (54Yew P.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 1-10Google Scholar). Reduced degradation of cell cycle proteins could account for the apparent abnormal activation of the cell cycle proteins observed in many neurodegenerative processes (55Husseman J.W. Nochlin D. Vincent I. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 815-828Google Scholar, 56Chang B.D. Watanabe K. Broude E.V. Fang J. Poole J.C. Kalinichenko T.V. Roninson I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4291-4296Google Scholar). Proteasomal inhibitors have recently been shown to induce degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and induce α-synuclein aggregation (57McNaught K.S. Bjorklund L.M. Belizaire R. Isacson O. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 1437-1441Google Scholar). The tendency of α-synuclein to accumulate under conditions of proteasomal inhibition raises the possibility that the accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein adds to the proteasomal inhibition and increases the toxicity associated with proteasomal inhibition. The discordance between the rapid kinetics of cell death associated with UPS inhibition in cell culture and the slow nature of degeneration in PD is notable. This discordance might be explained by the slow appearance of aggregated α-synuclein. α-Synuclein does not form aggregates under basal conditions when transiently overexpressed, but studies in transgenic mice show that overexpressing α-synuclein does lead to a delayed accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein (48Lee M.K.

Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Google Scholar). The slow rate of accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein could also lead to a correspondingly gradual inhibition of the UPS during the course of PD. Hence, progressive inhibition of the UPS by aggregated α-synuclein might be a gradual process in PD. Together these data suggest a model in which the gradual accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein progressively inhibits S6′ function, which leads to a gradual but progressive inhibition of the UPS and the progressive neurodegeneration that occurs in PD. We thank John Hardy (National Institutes of Health) for providing the α-synuclein cDNA, Philipp Kahle (University of Munich) for useful comments, and Thomas Gallagher (Loyola University Medical Center) for insight into sucrose gradient methodology."

We demonstrate that endogenous nCLU synthesis is a product of alternative splicing. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses revealed that exon II, containing the first AUG and encoding the endoplasmic reticulum-targeting peptide, was omitted. Exons I and III are spliced together placing a downstream AUG in exon III as the first available translation start site. This shorter mRNA produces the 49-kDa precursor nCLU protein. Ku70 binding activity was localized to the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of nCLU. Leucine residues 357, 358, and 361 of nCLU were necessary for Ku70-nCLU interaction.

Mutation analyses indicate that the C-terminal NLS was functional in nCLU with the same contribution from N-terminal NLS. The C-terminal coiled-coil domain of nCLU was the minimal region required for Ku binding and apoptosis. MCF-7 cells show nuclear as well as cytoplasmic expression of GFP-nCLU in apoptotic cells. Cytosolic aggregation of GFP-nCLU was found in viable cells.

One set of proteins is directed for secretion, and other CLU species are expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus (see below). The secretory form of the clusterin protein (sCLU) has been extensively studied and is produced by translation from the first AUG codon of the full-length CLU mRNA. sCLU is targeted to the ER by an initial leader peptide. This ∼60-kDa pre-sCLU protein is further glycosylated and proteolytically cleaved into α- and β-subunits, held together by disulfide bonds (12Wong P. Pineault J. Lakins J. Taillefer D. Leger J. Wang C. Tenniswood M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5021-5031Google Scholar, 13Yang C.R. Leskov K. Hosley-Eberlein K. Criswell T. Pink J.J. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The role(s) of CLU in cell death processes is also complex and may be different for the various forms of the protein. Recent data suggest that overexpression of sCLU in human cancer cells caused drug resistance and protection against certain cytotoxic agents that induce apoptosis (9Sensibar J.A. Sutkowski D.M.

Additional confirmatory data suggest that sCLU acts as a molecular chaperone, scavenging denatured proteins outside cells following specific stress-induced injury such as heat shock (17Clark A.M. Griswold M.D. J. Androl. 1997; 18: 257-263Google Scholar, 18Kimura K. Asami K. Yamamoto M. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1997; 15: 251-257Google Scholar, 19Michel D. Chatelain G. North S. Brun G. Biochem.

Vechietti J.L. Schifferli J.A. Tschopp J. French L.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 290-296Google Scholar). In fact, sCLU possesses nonspecific binding activity to hydrophobic domains of various proteins in vitro (20Humphreys D.T. Carver J.A. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Wilson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6875-6881Google Scholar), further supporting its role as a molecular chaperone acting to clear cellular debris. sCLU does not associate with Ku70 (14Yang C.R. Yeh S. Leskov K. Odegaard E. Hsu H.L. Chang C. Kinsella T.J. Chen D.J. Boothman D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2165-2174Google Scholar). Other data, including our own (13Yang C.R. Leskov K. Hosley-Eberlein K. Criswell T. Pink J.J. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5907-5912Google Scholar), show that overexpression of a specific nuclear form of CLU (nCLU) acts as a pro-death signal, inhibiting cell growth and survival. Our laboratory isolated CLU while searching for Ku70-binding proteins using a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human liver cDNA library (14Yang C.R. Yeh S. Leskov K. Odegaard E. Hsu H.L. Chang C. Kinsella T.J. Chen D.J. Boothman D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2165-2174Google Scholar). The specificity of nCLU-Ku70 interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, far Western, and confocal co-localization analyses of the two proteins in transfected or IR-treated MCF-7:WS8 (MCF-7) breast adenocarcinoma cells (13Yang C.R. Leskov K. Hosley-Eberlein K. Criswell T. Pink J.J. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5907-5912Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy revealed an apparently inactive form of nCLU (i.e. pnCLU) in the cytoplasm of non-irradiated cells (13Yang C.R. Leskov K. Hosley-Eberlein K. Criswell T. Pink J.J. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5907-5912Google Scholar) that subsequently translocated to the nucleus following clinically relevant low dose IR exposures (≥1Gy). Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated the presence of the Ku80 protein in the Ku70-nCLU complex, strongly suggesting that nCLU bound to the Ku70/Ku80 dimer (13Yang C.R. Leskov K. Hosley-Eberlein K. Criswell T. Pink J.J. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5907-5912Google Scholar). Overexpression of nCLU also blocked Ku70/Ku80 DNA end binding activity (14Yang C.R. Yeh S. Leskov K. Odegaard E. Hsu H.L. Chang C. Kinsella T.J. Chen D.J. Boothman D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2165-2174Google Scholar); however, the relationship between nCLU binding to Ku70 and cell death remained undetermined. Interestingly, an ∼49-kDa nuclear CLU precursor (pnCLU) was induced and translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after certain cytotoxic events, including IR (13Yang C.R. Leskov K. Hosley-Eberlein K. Criswell T. Pink J.J. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5907-5912Google Scholar) or transforming growth factor-β (22Reddy K.B. Jin G. Karode M.C. Harmony J.A. Howe P.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6157-6163Google Scholar) treatments. This “death” form of the CLU protein was proposed to be synthesized from a second in-frame AUG codon (13Yang C.R. Leskov K. Hosley-Eberlein K. Criswell T. Pink J.J. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5907-5912Google Scholar, 22Reddy K.B. Jin G. Karode M.C. Harmony J.A. Howe P.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6157-6163Google Scholar), although mechanisms of production were not elucidated. The pnCLU protein apparently lacks the ER-targeting leader peptide and does not undergo α/β cleavage or extensive glycosylation, as observed with sCLU (22Reddy K.B. Jin G. Karode M.C. Harmony J.A. Howe P.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6157-6163Google Scholar). pnCLU functions remain unknown. Following IR treatment of MCF-7 cells, an ∼55-kDa nCLU protein was expressed at extremely low levels in the nuclei of exposed cells (13Yang C.R. Leskov K. Hosley-Eberlein K. Criswell T. Pink J.J. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5907-5912Google Scholar). Overexpression of GFP-fused nCLU (initiated from the second AUG start codon in its mRNA) or a C-terminal 120-amino acid fragment (C-120) in MCF-7 cells resulted in significant growth inhibition, caspase 3-independent apoptosis, and lethality (13Yang C.R. Leskov K. Hosley-Eberlein K. Criswell T. Pink J.J. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5907-5912Google Scholar, 23Han B.H. DeMattos R.B. Dugan L.L. Kim-Han J.S.

All attempts to stably express nCLU resulted in lethality (13Yang C.R. Leskov K. Hosley-Eberlein K. Criswell T. Pink J.J. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5907-5912Google Scholar) or clones expressing G418 resistance without nCLU. 2C.-R. Yang, K. S. Leskov, and D. A. Boothman, unpublished observations.2C.-R. Yang, K. S. Leskov, and D. A. Boothman, unpublished observations. In contrast, overexpression of sCLU protein did not affect the survival of MCF-7 cells before or after IR stress (14Yang C.R. Yeh S. Leskov K. Odegaard E. Hsu H.L. Chang C. Kinsella T.J. Chen D.J. Boothman D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2165-2174Google Scholar). Analyses of the amino acid sequence of full-length rat CLU detected four “myosin tail-like” domains (24Tsuruta J.K. Wong K. Fritz I.B. Griswold M.D. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 571-578Google Scholar) that are synonymous with a “coiled-coil” structure. Coiled-coil domains are the most common motifs used by proteins for oligomerization, and consist of amphipathic α-helices usually with a 4-3 pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues repeated in heptads. To date, no structure/function studies of the CLU protein have been performed, and mechanisms of the production of nuclear forms of this protein has yet to be determined. The objectives of the following studies were as follows: (a) investigate the mechanism(s) of nCLU production; (b) identify the functional NLS of the protein; (c) identify the death domain of nCLU, and (d) elucidate the Ku70-binding domain of nCLU. These studies may then allow elucidation of the role of nCLU-Ku70 binding in cell death responses. We demonstrate that nCLU has one high affinity coiled-coil Ku70 binding domain within its C terminus. This domain is essential for its cell death function. Furthermore, nCLU contains an additional coiled-coil domain in its N terminus that interacts with its own C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Interestingly, the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of nCLU does not interact with Ku70. Furthermore, an N-terminal nCLU coiled-coil-containing peptide interfered with binding of the nCLU C-terminal coiled-coil domain with Ku70. Based on the apparent physical interactions of N- and C-terminal pnCLU coiled-coil domains, we offer a mechanism by which the inert ∼49-kDa pnCLU could become activated to an ∼55-kDa nCLU death protein. Finally, we discuss the cell death function of nCLU in damaged cells, and we propose mechanisms of cell death involving Ku70 binding. Based on probable splice sites, the following primers were used to investigate whether alternative splice forms of CLU could be found: hCLU5′, 5′-ACAGGGTGCCGCTGACC-3′; hCLUN-term-rev, 5′-TTAGAGCTCCTTCAGCTTTGTCTC TG-3′; NCLUforw-3, 5′-GCTGACCGAAATGTC-3′; hnCLUrev, 5′-TCACACCACCCGGTGCTTTTTG-3′. Total RNA from MCF-7 cells was extracted using RNAsol B (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription reactions were performed using the oligo(dT) primer (Promega) and Superscript II enzyme system (Invitrogen). The PCR step was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). When hCLU5′ and hCLUN-term-rev primers were used, PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, 62–72 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. When NCLUforw-3 primer was used in pair with either hCLUN-term-rev or hnCLUrev primers, optimal conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. A Bio-Rad iCycler Thermal Cycler was used for all reactions. RT-PCR products were resolved by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using the Concept Matrix Gel Extraction System (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing was performed by the Case Western Reserve University DNA Sequencing Service. EMBnet software (www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html) was used to analyze amino acid (aa) sequences of mouse and human CLU proteins for coiled-coil domain structures; coiled-coil domains in proteins are known to be important for protein-protein interactions (25Alber T. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1992; 2: 205-210Google Scholar, 26Hirai S. Yaniv M. New Biol. 1989; 1: 181-191Google Scholar, 27Kouzarides T. Packham G. Cook A. Farrell P.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 195-204Google Scholar). Analyses were performed using the algorithm published by Lupas et al.(28Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Google Scholar). Primary sequences of both human and mouse CLU proteins were retrieved from GenBankTM (accession numbers: S70244 for mouse and M64722 for human CLUs (12Wong P. Pineault J. Lakins J. Taillefer D. Leger J. Wang C. Tenniswood M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5021-5031Google Scholar, 29Jordan-Starck T.C. Lund S.D. Witte D.P. Aronow B.J. Ley C.A. Stuart W.D. Swertfeger D.K. Clayton L.R. Sells S.F.

Construction of PCR primer sets for deletion/mutation analyses of the CLU protein was performed using OligoTech version 1.00 software (Oligos Etc., Inc./Oligos Therapeutics, Wilsonville, OR). The Y190 yeast strain (HIS3,lacZ,trp1,leu2 (30Flick J.S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4757-4769Google Scholar, 31Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Google Scholar)) was used in two-hybrid structure/function analyses as described (13Yang C.R. Leskov K. Hosley-Eberlein K. Criswell T. Pink J.J. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2165-2174Google Scholar). Full-length mouse CLU cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. M. Tenniswood (Notre Dame University). Full-length mouse Ku70 cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. M. Abe (National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Japan). Human CLU and Ku70 constructs were used as described previously (14Yang C.R. Yeh S. Leskov K. Odegaard E. Hsu H.L. Chang C. Kinsella T.J. Chen D.J. Boothman D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2165-2174Google Scholar). Mouse CLU deletion mutants, containing aa residues 18–448, 18–97, 98–317, 18–380, 18–328, 256–328, 345–380, and 318–368, and human CLU deletion fragments 34–449 and 245–380 were created by PCR using the appropriate primer sets (described above). Deletion mutants were inserted into either pAS2-1 or pACT2 vectors (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) as prey or bait, respectively, using SmaI sites and the Perfectly BluntTM Cloning kit (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI), according to manufacturer's instructions. Mouse CLU deletion mutants containing amino acids 256–448, 256–380, and 256–344 were created using NcoI restriction enzyme digestion in combination withBamHI, ScaI, or PstI, respectively. The resulting fragments were then inserted into the pAS2-1 vector usingNcoI, BamHI, SmaI, and PstI restriction sites. Mouse Ku70 cDNA was excised from the original vector using BspLU11I and EcoRI enzymes, and inserted into pACT2 and pAS2-1 vectors, which were pre-digested withNcoI and EcoRI restriction enzymes. Point mutations within mouse CLU cDNAs were introduced using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) following the manufacturer's instructions. The LR mutant (substitution of 9 Leu residues to Arg within the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of mouse nCLU) was generated by direct cloning of a 155-bp DNA fragment containing all required nucleotide substitutions. This was accomplished by first synthesizing a single strand DNA fragment: 5′ GC CAG GAG CGG AAC GAC TCG CGC CAG GTG GCC GAG AGG CGGACA GAG CAG TAC AAG GAG CGG CGG CAG TCC TTC CAG TCG AAGATG CGC AAC ACC TCA TCC CGG CGG GAG CAG CGG AAC GAC CAGTTC AAC TGG GTG TCC CAG CGG GCT AAC CGC A 3′. This fragment was further amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) and the following pair of primers: AlmutPCR1 (30-mer), 5′ GCT AAC CTG CGC CAG GAG CGG AAC GAC TCG 3′, and AlmutPCR2 (38-mer), 5′ TTA GTA GTA CTT GTC TTC TCC CTG TGT GCG GTT AGC CC 3′. The PCR product was gel-purified, digested with the EcoNI restriction enzyme, and inserted into the pASnCLU, pAS-(256–448) and pGFPnCLU nCLU vectors, which were pre-digested with EcoNI to create NCLU-LR, NcoLR, and GFP-NCLU-LR, respectively. In addition, the undigested PCR product was inserted into a pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) using blunt ligation to create the GFP-CcLR mutant. Human CLU cDNA fragments encoding aa residues 84–449 and 329–449 in the pACT2 vector, as well as human Ku70 cDNA in the pAS2 vector, were described previously (13Yang C.R. Leskov K. Hosley-Eberlein K. Criswell T. Pink J.J. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5907-5912Google Scholar, 14Yang C.R. Yeh S. Leskov K. Odegaard E. Hsu H.L. Chang C. Kinsella T.J. Chen D.J. Boothman D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2165-2174Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced to verify in-frame positions with respect to the GAL4 domain. GAL4-Ku70 was co-transfected with various GAL4-CLU fragments into Y190 yeast using the protocol provided in the MATCHMAKER (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) manual. Stable transformants were grown for 6 days at 30 °C on plates containing His(−), Trp(−), Leu(−) and SD medium (Difco) containing 2% agarose and 15 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Colonies were subjected to on-filter β-galactosidase assays, with X-gal as a substrate. The reaction was considered positive when colonies turned blue within first 120 min of incubation with X-gal. Negative reactions (i.e. blue colonies were not observed) were indicative of no association, only when protein expression for each CLU or Ku70 mutant could be demonstrated by Western blot analyses (see below). Blue colonies that appeared after 120 min were regarded as false-positive signals. X-gal staining was performed on colony-lift filters as described (14Yang C.R. Yeh S. Leskov K. Odegaard E. Hsu H.L. Chang C. Kinsella T.J. Chen D.J. Boothman D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2165-2174Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal H-330 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect the 49-kDa species of CLU (pnCLU) in whole cell extracts from MCF-7 cells. A 1:2500 dilution of primary H-330 antibody was used followed by 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Yeast extracts were prepared using acid-washed glass beads as described in the MATCHMAKER kit manual and were used for Western blot analyses. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein concentration reagent as per manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Yeast extracts were mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved on either 10 or 15% PAGE gels, depending on the expected molecular weight of the proteins of interest. Proteins were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride-Plus membranes (MSI, Westboro, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk and probed with anti-GAL4BD or anti-GAL4AD monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was then used, and proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and x-ray film. All CLU deletion or point mutants were approximately equally expressed in yeast, and no loss of stability of proteins was noted. Full-length mouse Ku70 cDNA was amplified using PCR and the appropriate primer sets and inserted into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences) at aSmaI restriction site to generate an in-frame glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-fused protein. Escherichia coli NovaBlue Single Competent Cells (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) were used for plasmid propagation according to the protocol described in the Perfectly BluntTM Cloning kit manual (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). GST or GST-Ku70 fusion proteins were generated and purified using standard methods (32Acharya S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Kane M.F. Guerrette S. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R. Fishel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13629-13634Google Scholar). All genetically manipulated plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing prior to use. Glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were used for purification of GST-fused proteins as described (32Acharya S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Kane M.F. Guerrette S. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R. Fishel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13629-13634Google Scholar) using Binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 g/liter bovine serum albumin, proteinase inhibitors). Amounts of immobilized GST-Ku70 or GST (alone) proteins were estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels, with various amounts of bovine serum albumin protein used as standards. Mouse CLU cDNA fragments encoding amino acid residues 18–448 and 345–380 were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pT7Blue-2 vector (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) using the Perfectly BluntTM Cloning kit (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's instructions. All cDNA expression vectors were sequenced to confirm cloning before use. The TnT-coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to generate S·Tag-fused,35S-labeled CLU protein fragments in vitroaccording to manufacturer's protocols. The amount of35S-labeled protein was estimated using the S·Tag Rapid Assay kit (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI), and an equal amount of transcription/translation mixture (40 μl) was added to glutathione-containing beads at the same molar amounts (0.2 pmol of CLU to 0.2 pmol of GST or GST-Ku70) and incubated overnight at room temperature. The mixture was then incubated at 4, 23, or 37 °C for 1 h, and beads were collected by centrifugation (15,000 ×g), washed three times with ice-cold Binding buffer, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and boiled, and proteins were resolved by 10–15% SDS-PAGE. 35S-Labeled nCLU fragments were then visualized by autoradiography as described (33Boothman D.A.

To study the intracellular targeting of various nCLU fragments, we transfected MCF-7 cells with GFP-nCLU and GFP-nCLU deletion mutants. Effectin reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) was used to transfect 2 × 104 log phase MCF-7 cells that were pre-attached for 24 h to coverslips. Forty eight hours (48 h) later, cells were fixed for 1 h in freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. Cells were then rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and treated with RNase A in phosphate-buffered saline (1 μg/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were mounted in propidium iodide-containing Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) and subjected to confocal microscopy using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 Confocal Laser Scanning microscope (Bio-Rad). All photomicrographs show representative z-sections at ×1000 magnification. At least 180 transfected cells (green) were visually screened for distribution of GFP-CLU protein in the cell and its co-localization with propidium iodide-stained nuclei (red). The number of cells with pycnotic propidium iodide versus normal nuclear morphology was manually counted, and percentages of apoptotic cells ± S.E. were calculated (see Table I). Likewise, the number of cells with nuclear only, cytoplasmic and nuclear, or cytoplasmic only localization of the GFP-fused proteins was manually counted. Percentages of cells with nuclear (or cytoplasmic and nuclear) or cytoplasmic only expression ± S.E. were calculated (Table II).Table IInduction of apoptosis by exogenously expressed GFP-fused nCLU protein fragmentsProtein expressedCells with pycnotic nuclei (% of total) ± S.E.GFP4 ± 1GFP-nCLU25 ± 5GFP-N-term5 ± 12GFP-Center5 ± 1GFP-Ccoil31 ± 4GFP-End2 ± 0.5GFP-nCLU L343P2 ± 0.3Log phase MCF-7 cells were transfected with either GFP- or GFP-nCLU-fused cDNAs and analyzed 48 h later by confocal microscopy. z-sections were then analyzed for protein localization (Fig. 7), and percentages of apoptotic cells among GFP-positive cells were quantified.

Here we report that one mechanism involves dissociation of Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) from Raf-1. Classic and atypical but not novel PKC isoforms phosphorylate RKIP at serine 153 (Ser-153). RKIP Ser-153 phosphorylation by PKC either in vitro or in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or epidermal growth factor causes release of RKIP from Raf-1, whereas mutant RKIP (S153V or S153E) remains bound. Increased expression of PKC can rescue inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling cascade by wild-type but not mutant S153V RKIP. Taken together, these results constitute the first model showing how phosphorylation by PKC relieves a key inhibitor of the Raf/MAP kinase signaling cascade and may represent a general mechanism for the regulation of MAP kinase pathways.

RKIP Ser-153 phosphorylation by PKC either in vitro or in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or epidermal growth factor causes release of RKIP from Raf-1, whereas mutant RKIP (S153V or S153E) remains bound. Increased expression of PKC can rescue inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling cascade by wild-type but not mutant S153V RKIP. Taken together, these results constitute the first model showing how phosphorylation by PKC relieves a key inhibitor of the Raf/MAP kinase signaling cascade and may represent a general mechanism for the regulation of MAP kinase pathways. mitogen-activated protein Raf kinase inhibitory protein phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAP kinase/ERK kinase protein kinase C diacylglycerol epidermal growth factor hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulatory peptide hemagglutinin forward reverse glutathione S-transferase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate phosphate-buffered saline phosphoserine phosphatidylethanolamine binding calmodulin binding protein The MAP1 kinase cascade, an evolutionarily conserved signaling module, stimulates numerous biological processes including growth and differentiation. The known elements of the pathway include a MAP kinase kinase kinase that phosphorylates and activates a MAP kinase kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates the threonine-X-tyrosine (TXY) activation domain of MAP kinase (reviewed in Ref. 1Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3547) Google Scholar). The first characterized subfamily of MAP kinases, termed extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), is activated by growth factors and other stimuli via a cascade involving Ras, Raf-1 kinase, and MEK/ERK kinase (MEK). Activation of MAP kinase is under exquisite regulatory control, particularly at the level of Raf-1 activation. The N-terminal regulatory domain of Raf-1 interacts with Ras leading to dephosphorylation at negative regulatory sites, conformational changes to expose the kinase domain, and subsequent phosphorylation at activating sites such as serine 338 (Ser-338) and tyrosine 341 (Tyr-341) (reviewed in Ref. 2Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). A variety of studies have shown that protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes are also capable of activating Raf-1 (3Sözeri O. Voller K. Liyanage M. Frith D. Kour G. Mark III, G.E. Stabel S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2259-2262PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cacace A.M. Ueffing M. Philipp A. Han E.K. Kolch W. Weinstein I.B.

Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), but the mechanism has not been elucidated. The PKC family of serine/threonine kinases are key mediators of several physiological processes including growth, death, differentiation, and transformation (reviewed in Ref. 7Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar). There are three major classes of PKCs that are distinguished by their physiological activators. The classical PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ) require both Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (DAG) for activation whereas the novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, and θ) are Ca2+-independent but still require DAG. Both of these classes of PKCs are activated by phorbol esters that mimic the DAG stimulus. In contrast, the atypical PKCs, ζ and ι/λ, are Ca2+-, DAG-, and phorbol ester-independent. Not only are PKCs able to activate Raf-1, but in a number of cell systems they are required for the activation of ERKs by growth factors (8Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Chapkin R.S. Moscat J. Cell. 1993; 74: 555-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 9Cai H. Smola U. Wixler V. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Rapp U.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5392-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain how PKCs activate the ERK cascade, including direct phosphorylation of either MEK (12Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Flaherty D.M. Peterson M.W. Hunninghake G.W. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4632-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or Raf-1. Although the phosphorylation of MEK by PKCs is controversial (6Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), Raf-1 is phosphorylated by PKCs at multiple sites. For example, PKCα phosphorylates Raf-1 at serine 499 (13Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenceller G. Marne D. Rapp U. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), but mutation of this residue did not impede activation of Raf-1 by the physiological stimulators Ras and Lck. Similarly, both v-Src and phorbol esters were able to activate Raf-1 even though the PKC phosphorylation sites at serine 497 and serine 499 were mutated to alanine (14Yip-Schneider M.T. Miao W. Lin A. Barnard D.S. Tzivion G. Marshall M.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, although some PKC phosphorylation sites on Raf-1 have been identified, these sites do not appear to be required for activation of Raf-1. Recent studies from our laboratory suggest that ERK activation is mediated by specific PKC isoforms in response to different growth factors (10Corbit K.C. Foster D.A. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4209-4218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Corbit K.C. Soh J.W. Yoshida K. Eves E.M. Weinstein I.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5392-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In both the conditionally immortalized hippocampal cell line H19-7 (15Eves E.M. Tucker M.S. Roback J.D. Downen M. Rosner M.R. Wainer B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4373-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and primary E16 rat hippocampal cells, two different PKC isoforms, PKCζ and PKCδ, mediate ERK activation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor, respectively (10Corbit K.C. Foster D.A. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4209-4218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Corbit K.C. Soh J.W. Yoshida K. Eves E.M. Weinstein I.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5392-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both PKCs are required for activation of ERKs at a step upstream of MEK and either downstream or at the level of Raf-1. Although these studies suggested that PKCζ activates Raf-1 in response to EGF, phosphorylation of neither Raf-1 nor MEK appeared to be responsible (3Sözeri O. Voller K. Liyanage M. Frith D. Kour G. Mark III, G.E. Stabel S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2259-2262PubMed Google Scholar, 6Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1455-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Furthermore, phosphatase inhibitors such as okadaic acid did not alleviate the requirement for PKC (data not shown). We therefore considered the possibility that Raf-1 regulatory proteins might be potential targets of PKC. The Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP), was identified recently (17Yeung K. Seitz T. Li S. Janosch P. McFerran B. Kaiser C. Fee F. Katsanakis K.D. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Nature. 1999; 401: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) by yeast two-hybrid cloning utilizing the kinase domain of Raf-1 as bait. RKIP was found to be a member of the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family, a ubiquitously expressed protein with homologues in Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster that display high degrees of interspecies sequence similarity (18Serre L. Pereira de Jesus K. Zelwer C. Bureaud N. Schoentgen F. Benedetti H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 617-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). There are at least three RKIP-like PEBPs in rat, two in mice, and one in human (19Simister P.C. Banfield M.J. Brady R.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1077-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Also, amino acids 2–12 of PEBP are identical to the hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulatory peptide (HCNP) that stimulates acetylcholine synthesis in rat septal nuclei (20Ojika K. Kojima S. Ueki Y. Fukushima N. Hayashi K. Yamamoto M. Brain Res. 1992; 572: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PEBPs are distinct from other known proteins, and their function has remained largely enigmatic. In addition to binding phospholipids, PEBPs bind nucleotides and opioids and were shown recently (21Hengst U. Albrecht H. Hess D. Monard D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 535-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) to inhibit thrombin. A role for PEBP in signaling was demonstrated when it was shown that RKIP binds to Raf-1. RKIP itself is neither a kinase nor a substrate for Raf-1 or MEK (17Yeung K. Seitz T. Li S. Janosch P. McFerran B. Kaiser C. Fee F. Katsanakis K.D. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Nature. 1999; 401: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) but has been reported to be a specific inhibitor of MEK binding to Raf-1 (22Yeung K. Janosch P. McFerran B. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3079-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), suppressing both Raf-1-induced transformation and AP-1-dependent transcription. In the present study we demonstrate that one mechanism by which PKCs activate Raf-1 signaling to ERK involves the loss of inhibition by RKIP. Although both phorbol esters and PKCs have been well established as activators of MAP kinases, the targets for PKCs in this pathway are surprisingly unknown. Because phorbol esters are tumor promoters, and several components of the MAP kinase pathway are mutated in human cancers, the mechanism of PKC-mediated Raf/MAP kinase activation is of paramount importance. These results provide an explanation of how PKCs can physiologically regulate Raf-1 signaling. All constructs were made by the PCR using pCMV-HA-RKIP as template (a gift from K. Yeung, Brown University). The forward (F) and reverse (R) primers were as follows: F, 5′-atg gcc gcc gac atc agc cag tgg-3′; R, 5′-ctt ccc agc cag ctg atc gtg cag-3′. For the pCR-HA-RKIP and FLAG-RKIP constructs the forward primers were as follows: F-HA, 5′-ggc tcc atc atg tac cca tat gac gtt cca gac tac gct gcc gcc gac atc agc cag tgg-3′; F-FLAG, 5′-ggc tcc atc atg gac tac aag gac gac gac gac aag gcc gcc gac atc agc cag tgg-3′. The reverse primer (R-stop) was 5′-cta ctt ccc agc cag ctg atc gtg-3′. The PCR products were ligated into the pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced in both directions to confirm fidelity of the reactions. To make pGEX-RKIP, the open reading frame of RKIP was excised from pCR-RKIP by EcoRI digestion and ligated intoEcoRI-digested pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). Site-directed mutagenesis of Ser-153 to valine was done utilizing pGEX-RKIP as template and the unique site elimination (U.S.E.) kit (Amersham Biosciences). The following mutagenic primer was used: 5′-gta ctt ctt tcg aaa gac ctc cac ctt gaa ctt-3′. This primer binds to the negative strand of pGEX-RKIP and introduces a silent mutation resulting in the creation of a unique BstBI site and conversion of Ser-153 to valine. The NarI/NheI selection primer was from Amersham Biosciences. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing in both directions. The Ser-153 to glutamic acid (S153E) mutagenesis was done utilizing pGEX-RKIP as template and the QuickChange kit (Stratagene). The mutagenic primer was as follows: 5′-ggc aag ttc aag gtg gag gag ttt cga aag aag-3′. This primer introduces a silent mutation, resulting in the creation of a uniqueBstBI site and conversion of Ser-153 to glutamic acid. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing in both directions. The HA- and FLAG-tagged RKIP(S153V) and RKIP(S153E) plasmids were constructed by PCR utilizing the appropriate pGEX-RKIP plasmid as template. The F-HA and F-FLAG forward primers were used, along with the R-stop reverse primer, and ligated into the pCR3.1 vector to make pCR-HA- and FLAG-RKIP(S153V) and -RKIP(S153E). 1 μg of GST-RKIP or GST-RKIP(S153V) was combined with 200 ng of baculovirus-derived PKC (Panvera) in 50 μl of kinase buffer. For PKCs α, βI, βII, and γ the buffer used was 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 μm CaCl2, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 μg/ml l-α-phosphatidylserine, and 20 μg/ml diacylglycerol. The buffer used for novel PKCs δ, ε, and η was 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 200 μg/mll-α-phosphatidylserine, and 20 μg/ml diacylglycerol. The buffer for PKCζ was 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/mll-α-phosphatidylserine. Samples were aliquoted from premixed cocktails to ensure that the amounts of CBP-CR3 or PKCζ were the same in different tubes. The reactions were started by the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, carried out at 30 °C for 30 min, and then stopped by the addition of 6× sample buffer and heating at 100 °C for 3 min. The samples were loaded onto a 10% acrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed to film. The immortalized H19-7 cells were generated from embryonic rat hippocampal cells and grown as described previously (15Eves E.M. Tucker M.S. Roback J.D. Downen M. Rosner M.R. Wainer B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4373-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). H19-7 cells were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin/50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml G418 at 33 °C. Cells were serum-starved at 39 °C in N2 medium or DMEM overnight prior to treatment. COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin/50 μg/ml streptomycin. H19-7 cells were transfected with 10 μg of DNA per 10-cm plate using TransIT-LTI (Panvera). DNA in all transfections was added to equal amounts by addition of empty vector where necessary. 24 h following transfection, cells were starved overnight followed by treatment with 800 nm12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or 100 ng/ml EGF. HA-ERK2 kinase assays were performed in vitro as described previously (11Corbit K.C. Soh J.W. Yoshida K. Eves E.M. Weinstein I.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5392-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with either GST-Elk-1 or myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrates. The amount of HA-ERK2 in each sample was determined by immunoblot analysis with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3F10; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Relative kinase activity was measured with a phosphorimager and normalized to the amount of HA-ERK2 in each sample. For down-regulation of endogenous RKIP, H19-7 cells were transfected with empty vector, HA-ERK2, or HA-ERK2 plus the RKIP antisense construct AS-C143 and pHACT (17Yeung K. Seitz T. Li S. Janosch P. McFerran B. Kaiser C. Fee F. Katsanakis K.D. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Nature. 1999; 401: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). 24 h later, cells were starved overnight, and activation of HA-ERK2 was assayed as above. In some experiments, ERK activation was determined by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibodies. Samples were quantified by digital analysis (Alpha Innotech). In vitro binding assays were carried out as described (23Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) with modifications. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B was blocked with 10% normal goat serum followed by incubation with 2 μg of GST or GST-RKIP. Coupled GST fusion proteins were then incubated with 100 ng of PKCζ with 10% bovine serum albumin as nonspecific competitor for 1 h at 4 °C followed by extensive washing in TENNS buffer (2.5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5% sucrose). Bound proteins were resolved in a 12.5% acrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-PKCζ antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). For in vitro CBP-CR3 binding assays, GST fusion proteins were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B as above. 600 ng of bacterially expressed Raf-1 kinase domain (CBP-CR3) was added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. After extensive washing in TENNS buffer, 100 ng of PKCζ was added, and kinase assays were carried out as above. Bound proteins were resolved in a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-Raf-1 antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation of Raf and RKIP were carried out in a modification of a procedure described previously (17Yeung K. Seitz T. Li S. Janosch P. McFerran B. Kaiser C. Fee F. Katsanakis K.D. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Nature. 1999; 401: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). To observe association, immunoprecipitations were done with similarly mild conditions of sonication in phosphate-buffered saline without detergent. 7 μg of Myc-Raf-1 and 3 μg of HA-RKIP or HA-RKIP(S153V) were transfected into COS-7 cells. 24 h later, cells were starved overnight and subsequently treated as indicated in the figures. Cells were lysed by sonication in cold PBS plus protease inhibitors and cleared by centrifugation. To immunoprecipitate myc-Raf-1, 1 μg of anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10; Upstate Biotechnology) was added to 250 μg of cell lysate proteins and rotated at 4 °C followed by addition of 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose (1:1 slurry). The complex was washed three times with cold PBS and boiled in 3× PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were separated in 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibodies (12CA5-HRP; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to detect HA-RKIP. The blot was then stripped and re-probed with anti-Raf-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) to document amounts of Myc-Raf-1 in all samples. Anti-RKIP antisera were made by immunization of rabbits with purified GST-RKIP (α-RKIP). Anti-phospho-Ser-153-RKIP antisera (α-pSer-153-RKIP) were made by immunization of rabbits with a peptide (United Biochemicals) corresponding to residues 146–157 of the rat RKIP sequence conjugated to ovalbumin, NH-RGKFKVES*FRKK-COOH, where the S* indicates a phosphoserine residue. α-pSer-153-RKIP was affinity-purified by passing the crude antisera through a column containing the immunogenic peptide followed by protein A-Sepharose chromatography for concentration. To determine whether RKIP is able to inhibit ERK activation by EGF or TPA in H19-7 cells, exogenous RKIP was introduced into cells. Plasmids expressing HA-ERK2 and FLAG-RKIP were co-transfected into H19-7 cells, and activation of HA-ERK upon cell stimulation was measured by an in vitrokinase assay using Elk-1 as a substrate. As shown in Fig.1A, overexpression of RKIP is able to block HA-ERK2 activation by EGF and TPA. These results indicate that RKIP is capable of inhibiting the activation of ERK by these stimuli. To determine whether endogenous RKIP normally regulates ERK activity, an antisense RKIP construct, pAS-C143, that was shown previously (17Yeung K. Seitz T. Li S. Janosch P. McFerran B. Kaiser C. Fee F. Katsanakis K.D. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Nature. 1999; 401: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) to suppress endogenous RKIP, was co-transfected, along with HA-ERK2, into H19-7 cells, and HA-ERK2 activation was assayed before and after EGF or TPA stimulation (Fig. 1B). The ability of the antisense RKIP to selectively suppress RKIP expression in H19-7 cells was confirmed by co-transfection of RKIP and antisense RKIP (data not shown). Expression of the antisense RKIP construct significantly increased both EGF- and TPA-stimulated HA-ERK2 activity, suggesting that RKIP physiologically regulates signaling to MAP kinase triggered by EGF, as well as other activators of protein kinase C, in H19-7 cells. Having established that RKIP regulates the EGF and TPA stimulation of ERK (see Fig. 1A) and previously demonstrated a requirement for PKCζ in EGF-stimulated ERK activation, we investigated whether RKIP and PKCs could interact directly. An analysis of the RKIP protein sequence for PKC consensus phosphorylation sites (24Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) identified Ser-153 of the rat RKIP sequence as a potential target. This site was mutated to a non-phosphorylatable valine residue (S153V), and the mutant RKIP was cloned into a bacterial expression vector to produce recombinant GST-RKIP(S153V). Purified GST-RKIP and GST-RKIP(S153V) were then used as substrates for PKC inin vitro kinase assays. As shown in Fig.1C, RKIP is a substrate for PKCs α, βI, βII, γ, and ζ, and substitution of Ser-153 prevents most of this phosphorylation. Overexposure of the blot reveals some additional phosphorylation by PKCs α and γ, but the amount is low compared with the phosphorylation of Ser-153. These data demonstrate that Ser-153 is the major site of RKIP phosphorylation by PKC. Interestingly, the novel PKCs, including, PKCs δ, ε, and η, are not RKIP kinases in vitro, suggesting that RKIP phosphorylation is not a feature of all PKC isozymes. Because PKCζ is able to phosphorylate RKIP, we determined whether PKCζ and RKIP could associate in vitro and in vivo. We focused on the PKCζ isoform based on our previous work (11Corbit K.C. Soh J.W. Yoshida K. Eves E.M. Weinstein I.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5392-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) indicating that PKCζ mediates Raf-1 activation by EGF in H19-7 cells; however, because classical PKCs can phosphorylate RKIP in vitro, we expect that they would also associate physically and mediate the action of TPA, as well as specific growth factors dependent upon the particular cell type. As shown in Fig. 1D, recombinant PKCζ binds to GST-RKIP but not GST. These results indicate that RKIP and PKCζ are capable of interacting specifically. However, no stable association was detected in vivo (data not shown), consistent with an enzyme-substrate interaction. Because PKCζ potentiates Raf activity (11Corbit K.C. Soh J.W. Yoshida K. Eves E.M. Weinstein I.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5392-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we determined whether direct phosphorylation of RKIP by PKCζ could result in the release of RKIP from Raf-1. To test this possibility in vitro, GST, GST-RKIP, or GST-RKIP(S153V) were pre-bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with a bacterially expressed Raf-1 kinase domain (CBP-CR3) (25King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), the region of Raf that binds to RKIP. The Raf-1 kinase domain bound to both wild-type RKIP and RKIP(S153V) (Fig.2A). Addition of purified PKCζ and ATP led to the release of the Raf-1 kinase domain from GST-RKIP but not from GST-RKIP(S153V), demonstrating that phosphorylation of Ser-153 on RKIP by PKCζ causes dissociation of the Raf-1 kinase domain and RKIP. To test the effect of PKC on the interaction of RKIP with full-length Raf-1 in cells, Myc-Raf-1 was co-transfected into COS-7 cells with HA-RKIP or HA-RKIP(S153V), and the association of the two molecules was determined before and after TPA stimulation. In agreement with results published previously (22Yeung K. Janosch P. McFerran B. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3079-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), we observed that transfected Myc-Raf-1 and HA-RKIP could be co-immunoprecipitated from starved COS-7 cells and that activation of PKC by TPA alone induced the release of HA-RKIP from Myc-Raf-1 (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the cell lysates by immunoblotting indicated that both TPA-treated and untreated cells contain comparable levels of HA-RKIP (data not shown). Treatment of H19-7 cells with physiological PKC activators such as EGF also induced dissociation of endogenous RKIP from endogenous c-Raf-1 by 59%, as shown using an horseradish peroxidase-tagged anti-RKIP antibody for immunoblotting to eliminate background from light chain antibody (Fig.2C). If the mechanism for RKIP dissociation from Raf-1 involves phosphorylation of RKIP by PKC, then the mutant RKIP(S153V) should remain bound to Raf-1 independent of PKC activation. Consistent with this prediction, HA-RKIP(S153V) co-immunoprecipitated with myc-Raf-1 in both resting and TPA-treated COS-7 cells (Fig.2B). Similar results were obtained when GST-Raf rather than myc-Raf was co-expressed with RKIP, and the complexes were isolated using glutathione beads (data not shown). These results indicate that PKC can regulate RKIP binding to Raf-1 kinase in vivo by phosphorylating RKIP at residue Ser-153. Because the above phosphorylation studies used exogenous RKIP, we determined whether endogenous cellular RKIP is phosphorylated similarly at Ser-153 in response to PKC activation. Therefore, we generated antibodies against phosphorylated Ser-153 RKIP (α-pSer-153-RKIP) by immunizing rabbits with a 12-amino acid peptide containing residues 146–157 of the rat RKIP sequence with a phosphoserine at position 153 and purifying the antibody via peptide affinity chromatography. To test the specificity of the antibody, GST-RKIP and GST-RKIP(S153V) were initially incubated with recombinant PKC and ATP to phosphorylate RKIP. The products of this reaction were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, along with GST, unphosphorylated GST-RKIP, GST-RKIP(S153V), and GST-RKIP(S153E), a mutant of GST-RKIP with glutamic acid substituted at residue 153 to mimic phosphorylation at this site. Immunoblot analysis with the purified α-pSer-153-RKIP antibody strongly detected a single 48-kDa band corresponding to GST-RKIP that was phosphorylated by PKC (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the antibody did not recognize unphosphorylated GST-RKIP, GST, GST-RKIP(S153V), or GST-RKIP(S153E). These data demonstrate that the purified antibody specifically detects RKIP phosphorylated at Ser-153. Because phorbol esters are the most robust and specific activators of PKCs, we initially examined the state of RKIP Ser-153 phosphorylation in cells following TPA stimulation utilizing the α-pSer-153-RKIP antibody. Western blot analysis of H19-7 cell lysates revealed minimal pSer-153-RKIP in starved cells (Fig. 3B). Stimulation with TPA resulted in the induction of a 23-kDa band corresponding in size to RKIP. Pre-incubation of cells with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I blocked Ser-153 phosphorylation, demonstrating that PKC is indeed mediating this phosphorylation. Inclusion of the immunizing peptide in the buffer inhibited antibody recognition, verifying the specificity of the recognition site (data not shown). This data demonstrates that RKIP is phosphorylated on Ser-153 in vivo in a PKC-dependent manner. To determine whether the physiological activator EGF can induce phosphorylation of RKIP by PKC, two approaches were utilized. In one set of experiments, H19-7 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged RKIP or RKIP(S153V). Following treatment of cells with 100 ng/ml nm EGF for 2–15 min, FLAG-RKIP was isolated from cell lysates using an anti-FLAG affinity column and eluted with FLAG peptide. After separation by SDS-PAGE, the induction of phosphorylated RKIP was determined by immunoblotting with the α-pSer-153-RKIP antibody. As shown in Fig. 3C, EGF stimulated phosphorylation of RKIP, and the peak of phosphorylation occurred at 2 min. This time course corresponds to those of Raf and ERK activation, which also peak at 2 min in response to EGF in H19-7 cells (data not shown). In an alternative approach involving endogen"

The STAM proteins interact with the same coiled-coil domain that is involved in the targeting of Hrs to endosomes. In this work, we show that STAM1 and STAM2, as well as an endocytic regulator protein, Eps15, can be co-immunoprecipitated with Hrs both from membrane and cytosolic fractions and that recombinant Hrs, STAM1/STAM2, and Eps15 form a ternary complex. We find that overexpression of Hrs causes a strong recruitment of STAM2 to endosome membranes. Moreover, STAM2, like Hrs and Eps15, binds ubiquitin, and Hrs, STAM2, and Eps15 colocalize with ubiquitinated proteins in clathrin-containing endosomal microdomains. The localization of Hrs, STAM2, Eps15, and clathrin to endosome membranes is controlled by the AAA ATPase mVps4, which has been implicated in multivesicular body formation. Depletion of cellular Hrs by small interfering RNA results in a strongly reduced recruitment of STAM2 to endosome membranes and an impaired degradation of endocytosed epidermal growth factor receptors. We propose that Hrs, Eps15, and STAM proteins function in a multivalent complex that sorts ubiquitinated proteins into the multivesicular body pathway.

The molecular machinery that diverts endocytosed membrane proteins from the default recycling pathway and sorts them into the degradative pathway is currently being elucidated. Two structurally related proteins, Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) and STAM (signal-transducing adaptormolecule), have attracted interest in this context (3Raiborg C. Stenmark H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 439-444Google Scholar, 4Lohi O. Lehto V.P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 287-290Google Scholar). Both these proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated upon growth factor and cytokine stimulation (5Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Google Scholar, 6Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T.

Urbanowski J.L. Winistorfer S.C. Piper R.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 534-539Google Scholar). Hrs contains multiple domains, including an N-terminal VHS domain, a FYVE domain that binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (10Gaullier J.-M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Aasland R. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Google Scholar), a coiled-coil domain, and a clathrin-binding domain (11Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. J. Biol.

Electron microscopy studies of Hrs mutant Drosophila larvae revealed an impairment in endosome membrane invagination and formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs)1(16Lloyd T.E. Atkinson R. Wu M.N. Zhou Y. Pennetta G. Bellen H.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 261-269Google Scholar), suggesting that Hrs may play a crucial role in MVB formation and membrane trafficking from endosomes to degradative compartments. Ubiquitination functions as a sorting signal for the degradative endocytic pathway (17Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Google Scholar, 18Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Google Scholar), and the binding of Hrs to ubiquitinated proteins via its ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) appears to be important for their sorting (19Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Gillooly D. Madshus I.H. Stang E. Stenmark H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 394-398Google Scholar). The two related proteins STAM1 and STAM2 (also known as Hbp (Hrs-binding protein)) share an N-terminal VHS domain, like Hrs. These proteins also contain a Src homology 3 domain, a coiled-coil domain, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (7Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1035-1039Google Scholar). They both interact with Janus kinases and appear to function downstream of Janus kinases 3 and 2 in cytokine signaling (8Endo K. Takeshita T. Kasai H. Sasaki Y. Tanaka N. Asao H. Kikuchi K. Yamada M.

Biol. 2002; 22: 8648-8658Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of STAM1 and STAM2 inhibit cytokine signaling in transfected lymphocytes (20Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Google Scholar), and conditional double knockout of STAM1 and STAM2 in mouse T-lymphocytes causes abnormalities in their development and survival (21Yamada M. Ishii N. Asao H. Murata K. Kanazawa C. Sasaki H. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8648-8658Google Scholar). In contrast, mice with single knockouts of STAM1 or STAM2 are viable and have normal lymphocyte functions, indicating that the two proteins have redundant functions (21Yamada M. Ishii N. Asao H. Murata K. Kanazawa C. Sasaki H. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8648-8658Google Scholar, 22Yamada M. Takeshita T. Miura S. Murata K. Kimura Y. Ishii N. Nose M. Sakagami H. Kondo H. Tashiro F. Miyazaki J.I. Sasaki H. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3807-3819Google Scholar). Besides their roles in signal transduction, STAM proteins may also regulate endocytic membrane trafficking. A deletion mutant of STAM2 that is unable to bind Hrs suppresses the degradation of platelet-derived growth factor and its receptor but not the internalization of platelet-derived growth factor (23Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Google Scholar). This suggests that an interaction of STAM2 with Hrs is essential for the degradative sorting of platelet-derived growth factor and its receptor. STAM1 and STAM2 form a tight interaction with Hrs via the same coiled-coil domain that targets Hrs to the early endosomal membrane (6Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32785-32791Google Scholar,8Endo K. Takeshita T. Kasai H. Sasaki Y. Tanaka N. Asao H. Kikuchi K. Yamada M. Chen M. O'Shea J.J. Sugamura K.

This has raised three possible models for the membrane recruitment of Hrs and STAM proteins. 1) STAM proteins may recruit Hrs to endosomes. 2) Hrs may recruit STAM proteins to endosomes. 3) Hrs-STAM complex formation and membrane association may be mutually exclusive. In this report we have tested these models and tried to elucidate the function of the STAM-Hrs complex. We have also investigated the relationship between the Hrs-STAM complex and the ubiquitin-binding protein Eps15. Rabbit antibodies against recombinant Hrs have been described before (14Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Mehlum A. Stang E. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5008-5021Google Scholar). Antisera against STAM1 and STAM2 were made by Eurogentec (Herstal, Belgium) by injecting rabbits with a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 315–329 of STAM1 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin or with recombinant GST-STAM2. The STAM2 antiserum was affinity-purified on Affi-Gel beads (Bio-Rad) containing immobilized MBP-STAM2, and the STAM1 antiserum was affinity-purified by coupling the same peptide that was used for injecting the rabbits to a SulfoLink Coupling Gel (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control experiments demonstrated that the antibodies against Hrs, STAM1, and STAM2 did not cross-react. Anti-Myc antibodies were from the 9E10 hybridoma (24Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the VSV-G epitope were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against conjugated mono- and polyubiquitin (FK2) or conjugated polyubiquitin only (FK1) (25Fujimuro M. Sawada H. Yokosawa H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 173-180Google Scholar) were from Affiniti Research Products (Exeter, UK). Human anti-EEA1 serum (26Mu F.T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G.

Rabbit anti-Eps15 (C terminus) and goat anti-clathrin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Sheep anti-EGF-receptor was from Fitzgerald (Concord, MA). Rhodamine-, fluorescein isothiocyanate-, Cy2-, Cy3-, Cy5-, and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). The Hrs constructs indicated were generated by PCR with mouse Hrs (5Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Google Scholar) as the template. The STAM constructs used were generated by PCR with human STAM1 (7Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1035-1039Google Scholar) and mouse STAM2 (Hbp) (23Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Google Scholar) as the templates. For use in the two-hybrid system, constructs were cloned into pLexA/pBTM116 (27Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Google Scholar) as bait and pGAD GH (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as prey. For expression in mammalian cells with the T7 RNA polymerase vaccinia virus system, constructs were cloned behind the Myc epitope of pGEM-Myc4 (28Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Rønning E. Aasland R. Stenmark H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 223-231Google Scholar). Mouse Skd1E235Q/Vps4E235Q was generated by PCR amplification with pTKS-mVps4E235Q (kindly provided by Markus Babst and Scott Emr, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA) as a template and cloned behind the VSV-G epitope of pGEM-VSVG (28Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Rønning E. Aasland R. Stenmark H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 223-231Google Scholar). For bacterial expression of His6-tagged Eps15, the Eps15 sequence from pEGFP-Eps15 (29Benmerah A. Poupon V. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 275: 3288-3295Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Alexandre Benmerah) was cloned into the expression vector pHAT (30Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Google Scholar). For siRNA experiments, 21-nucleotide RNA duplexes with 2-nucleotide 3′-(2-deoxy)thymidine overhangs were synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). RNA sequences were as follows: sense, 5′-CGA CAA GAA CCC ACA CGU CdTdT; antisense, 5′-GAC GUG UGG GUU CUU GUC GdTdT. Control sequence was as follows: sense, 5′-GGG GCG AGG CAG CGG CAC CdTdT. BHK-21, HEp-2, and HeLa cell cultures were maintained as recommended by ATCC. The pGEM-VSVG-STAM and pGEM-Myc-Hrs constructs and pGEM-Myc-mVps4E235Q were expressed in BHK-21 cells using modified Ankara T7 RNA polymerase recombinant vaccinia virus (31Sutter G. Ohlmann M. Erfle V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 9-12Google Scholar) and lipofection as described (32Stenmark H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 155-164Google Scholar). Transfection of HeLa cells with siRNA was performed as described (33Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Google Scholar). The cells were first transfected with siRNA for 3 days, and then the cells were replated and the transfection was repeated for another 3 days. BHK cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 37 paraformaldehyde after transfections and stained for fluorescence microscopy as described (28Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Rønning E. Aasland R. Stenmark H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 223-231Google Scholar). When indicated, the cells were permeabilized with 0.057 saponin prior to fixation. Coverslips were examined using a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser and a PL Fluotar ×100/1.3 oil immersion objective or a Zeiss LSM 510 META microscope equipped with a Neo-Fluar ×100/1.45 oil immersion objective. GST fusion proteins of STAM1 and STAM2 was produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with the respective pGEX constructs as described previously (14Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Mehlum A. Stang E. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5008-5021Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) after lysis of the bacteria in B-PERTM reagent (Pierce) according to the instructions from the manufacturers. Expression of MBP-Hrs has been described previously (14Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Mehlum A. Stang E. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5008-5021Google Scholar). His6-Eps15 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pHAT-Eps15. For measurements of ubiquitin binding, aliquots (10 ॖl) of protein A-agarose (Sigma) or ubiquitin-agarose (Sigma) were washed three times with assay buffer A (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, 125 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mmmagnesium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) before incubation with 0.02 nmol of GST-STAM2 in 300 ॖl of assay buffer A containing 107 fetal calf serum and 0.17 Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the beads were washed four times in assay buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. STAM2 associated with the beads was detected by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the rabbit anti-STAM2 antibody. For measurements of ternary complex formation, bacterially expressed GST, GST-STAM1 or GST-STAM2 (30 pmol) were mixed in 1 ml of assay buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with glutathione-Sepharose beads (10 ॖl) and recombinant His6-Eps15 (30 pmol) in the absence or presence of recombinant MBP-Hrs (30 pmol). After 1 h at rotation at 4 °C, the beads were washed extensively with assay buffer B and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Eps15. HEp-2 cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 250 mm sucrose, mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) by repeated passages through a 22-gauge needle at 4 °C. Membrane particulate and cytosolic fractions were prepared from postnuclear supernatants by ultracentrifugation for 15 min at 65,000 rpm in a TLA-100 rotor, using a Beckman table top ultracentrifuge. HEp-2 cells were fractionated as described, and the membrane particulate pellet was dissolved in lysis buffer (125 mmKAc, 25 mm HEPES, 25 mm MgAc, 5 mmEGTA, 0.57 Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2, mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The two fractions were incubated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) preincubated with 20 ॖl of affinity-purified anti-Hrs after preclearance with protein A-Sepharose only. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with washing buffer (125 mm KAc, 25 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm MgAc, 5 mm EGTA, 0.17 Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2, proteinase inhibitor mixture), eluted in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE, and run on 107 gels. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to 0.45-ॖm pore size polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies before detection with the SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). HEp-2 cells were starved for 4 h and stimulated or not with 100 ng/ml EGF for 8 min. The cells were lysed, and STAM2 was immunoprecipitated as described, using 25 ॖl of affinity-purified anti-STAM2. Complexes of STAM2, Hrs, and Eps15 were eluted in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and run on 107 gels. Proteins were transferred to 0.45-ॖm pore size polyvinylidene difluoride membranes following SDS-PAGE and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies before detection with the SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit. HeLa cells were transfected twice at 72-h intervals with a siRNA duplex specific for nucleotides 161–180 of the Hrs coding sequence, with a sense RNA as a negative control. Hrs levels were analyzed by Western blotting of total cell lysates. The amount of total EGF-R was measured by immunofluorescence after a 30-min pulse of 200 ng/ml EGF and undegraded EGF-R after a 3-h chase in the presence of 10 ॖg/ml cycloheximide to prevent synthesis of new EGF-R. The cells were permeabilized with 0.057 saponin prior to fixation and stained with anti-EGF-R. The mean intensity of the Cy2 EGF-R signal from 20 siRNA-treated and 20 control cells after 3 h of chase was quantified and was presented as the percentage of total EGF-R. The mean intensity of total EGF-R was quantified by counting 20 control and 20 siRNA cells after a 30-min EGF pulse. No significant differences were found in the amount of total EGF-R in control and siRNA cells at this time point. Error bars denote S.E. Since the coiled-coil domain of Hrs binds STAM1/STAM2 (6Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32785-32791Google Scholar, 23Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Google Scholar) and is essential for the localization of Hrs to early endosomes (15Raiborg C. Bremnes B. Mehlum A. Gillooly D.J. Stang E. Stenmark H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2255-2263Google Scholar), this raises the question of whether Hrs can bind to both STAM proteins and the endosomal membrane at the same time. We investigated this by immunoprecipitating Hrs from the cytosol and membrane fractions of HEp-2 cells and studied whether STAM1 and STAM2 coprecipitated from both. As shown in Fig.1, although Hrs was most abundant in the cytosolic fraction, STAM1 and STAM2 coprecipitated with Hrs from both the membranes and the cytosol. No STAM1/STAM2 was detected in the absence of anti-Hrs (not shown). These results indicate that the association between Hrs and STAM is not disturbed by membrane localization and that STAM proteins and Hrs are present in a complex both in the cytosol and on membranes. Besides STAM proteins, Eps15, a protein that regulates endocytosis, has also been found to interact directly with Hrs (34Bean A.J. Davanger S. Chou M.F. Gerhardt B. Tsujimoto S. Chang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15271-15278Google Scholar). To study whether Eps15 is associated with Hrs in cytosol or on membranes, we therefore also probed the blot with an antibody to Eps15 (Fig. 1). The result showed that Eps15, like STAM proteins, coimmunoprecipitates with Hrs both from cytosol and membrane fractions. Eps15 has been shown to relocalize to the plasma membrane and subsequently to EGF-R-positive endosomes upon activation of the EGF-R kinase (35Torrisi M.R. Lotti L.V. Belleudi F. Gradini R. Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 417-434Google Scholar). The finding that Eps15 interacts with Hrs in membrane fractions suggests that Hrs could be important in order to determine the relocalization of Eps15 during endocytosis. Quantitative Western blotting experiments using recombinant proteins as reference standards indicated that approximately equimolar amounts of Eps15 were coimmunoprecipitated with Hrs, whereas the amount of STAM proteins co- immunoprecipitated varied between equimolar amounts and 207 (not shown). Whereas the reason for this variation is not known, these results are consistent with the possibility that Hrs is present in stoichiometric complexes with Eps15 and STAM1/STAM2. The binding sites in Hrs for STAM2 and Eps15 are distinct, but it is not known if Hrs is capable of interacting with these proteins in a ternary complex. We therefore investigated whether both Hrs and Eps15 could be coimmunoprecipitated with STAM2. We found, by analyzing the samples on SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, that all three proteins were present in the STAM2 immunoprecipitate (Fig.2A). The extent of coimmunoprecipitation was independent of EGF stimulation, which is known to cause the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Hrs, STAM proteins, and Eps15 (5Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol.

This indicates that Hrs interacts with Eps15 and STAM2 in a manner that is independent of phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the individual components. Previous work has shown that the chick homolog of STAM2, EAST, coimmunoprecipitates with Eps15 (40Lohi O. Poussu A. Meriläinen J. Kellokumpu S. Wasenius V.-M. Lehto V.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21408-21415Google Scholar). Both EAST and STAM contain an N-terminal NPF motif that, in principle, might bind to the epsin homology domains of Eps15. Although mutagenesis of the NPF motif in EAST did not abolish its coimmunoprecipitation with Eps15 (40Lohi O. Poussu A. Meriläinen J. Kellokumpu S. Wasenius V.-M. Lehto V.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21408-21415Google Scholar), we could not rule out the possibility that Eps15 may interact directly with STAM1/STAM2 and thus participate in two different complexes, one with STAM1/STAM2 and one with Hrs. To investigate this possibility, we incubated GST-STAM1 and GST-STAM2 with recombinant Eps15 in the absence or presence of recombinant Hrs. We retrieved the GST fusion proteins with glutathione-Sepharose beads and analyzed their possible content of Eps15 by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2B, Eps15 did not associate with beads containing GST-STAM1 or GST-STAM2. However, in the presence of Hrs, Eps15 was associated with both GST-STAM1 and GST-STAM2. This indicates that Hrs is able to bridge STAM proteins with Eps15 and that Hrs, STAM proteins, and Eps15 are present in the same complex. Given that Hrs interacts with STAM1 and STAM2 and that the association to endosomal membranes does not appear to interfere with this interaction, we addressed whether Hrs recruits STAM proteins to membranes or if STAM proteins may recruit Hrs. Because our STAM2 antibody was superior to that of STAM1 for immunocytochemistry, we restricted our investigation to STAM2. By overexpressing STAM2, we found that it was mainly cytosolic (Fig.3, A and C), and it had no effect on the endosomal distribution of endogenous Hrs (Fig. 3,B and D). When we permeabilized the cells prior to fixation, almost all of the overexpressed STAM2 was extracted (Fig.3C), in agreement with its predominant localization to the cytosol. In contrast, when STAM2 was coexpressed together with Hrs (Fig. 3, E and F), it colocalized strongly with Hrs on clustered vesicles positively stained for the early endosomal marker EEA1 (26Mu F.T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.P. Tock E.P. Toh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Google Scholar) (Fig. 3G). Overexpression of Hrs alone (Fig. 3J) gave the same pattern of Hrs on clustered EEA1-positive vesicles (Fig. 3K). Significantly, we observed a very strong endosomal staining of endogenous STAM2 in cells transfected with Hrs (Fig. 3I), whereas the staining of endogenous STAM2 in untransfected cells gave a weaker signal (Fig.3M). This is probably due to a strong recruitment of STAM2 from cytosol to endosomes in the presence of overexpressed Hrs. Even in untransfected cells, STAM2 colocalized extensively with EEA1 (Fig. 3,M–O), indicating that a portion of endogenous STAM2 is indeed associated with early endosome membranes. The above results indicated that overexpression of Hrs causes an increased recruitment of STAM2 to endosomes. To study whether Hrs is required for the membrane recruitment of STAM2, we attempted to deplete HeLa cells of Hrs by using siRNA (41Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Google Scholar). Control cells (treated with a Hrs-specific sense RNA) and siRNA-treated cells were fractionated into cytosol and membrane fractions, and the levels of Hrs and STAM2 were analyzed by Western blotting. We loaded relatively higher amounts of membrane fractions, since Hrs is most abundant in the cytosol (see Fig.1). As shown in Fig. 4A(upper panel), siRNA treatment caused a strong reduction in Hrs levels both in the cytosol (lanes 1 and 2) and membrane fractions (lanes 3 and 4). Importantly, the decreased level of Hrs in the membrane fraction was accompanied by a strong reduction in membrane-associated STAM2 (middle panel,lanes 3 and 4). This indicates that the recruitment of STAM2 to membranes requires Hrs. To assess whether the reduced association of STAM2 with the membrane fraction of Hrs-depleted cells reflected an impaired recruitment to endosomes, we studied the siRNA-treated cells by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4B). In control cells, STAM2 could be readily detected on EEA1-positive endosomes. By contrast, in siRNA-treated cells, a diffuse, cytosolic STAM2 staining could be observed, with only faint labeling of endosomes. Interestingly, enlarged endosomes could be observed in siRNA-treated cells, reminiscent to the phenotype observed in Hrs −/− mouse embryos (42Komada M. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1475-1485Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that whereas Hrs is independent of STAM2 for the binding to endosomes, Hrs is required for the recruitment of STAM2 to endosomes. The yeast homologue of Hrs, Vps27p, was identified in a screen for vpsmutants defective in vacuolar protein sorting (43Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell.

A functional binding site for the high mobility group protein lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) was found adjacent to the proximal Runx2-binding site in the osteocalcin promoter. In transcription assays, LEF1 repressed Runx2-induced activation of the mouse osteocalcin 2 promoter in several osteoblast lineage cell lines.

Moreover, a dominant-negative Runx2 protein prevents osteoblast differentiation in adult mice without decreasing osteoblast numbers (5Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Google Scholar). Runx2 haploinsufficiency hinders intramembranous bone formation and causes the rare skeletal disorder, cleidocranial dysplasia (6Mundlos S. Otto F. Mundlos C. Mulliken J.B. Aylsworth A.S. Albright S.

Interestingly, Runx2overexpression induces bone fragility by blocking osteoblast differentiation and enhancing bone resorption (7Liu W. Toyosawa S. Furuichi T. Kanatani N. Yoshida C. Liu Y. Himeno M.

These genetic studies demonstrate that cellular control of Runx2 expression levels and function is crucial for skeletal development. At the molecular level, Runx2 activity is regulated by multiple transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms (9Komori T. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 87: 1-8Google Scholar). Runx proteins activate or repress gene expression by binding the DNA sequence, TGPuGGTPu (10Meyers S. Downing J.R. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6336-6345Google Scholar). Runx-binding sites are often necessary but are not sufficient for transcriptional regulation of tissue-specific genes; thus, it has been hypothesized that Runx proteins are organizers that facilitate the assembly of transcriptional regulatory complexes on gene regulatory elements (11Redondo J.M. Pfohl J.L. Hernandez-Munain C. Wang S. Speck N.A. Krangel M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4817-4823Google Scholar, 12Wang S.W. Speck N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 89-102Google Scholar). Runx factors, in fact, interact with numerous transcription factors (e.g. AP1, C/EBP, Ets1, and SMADs) and transcriptional co-factors (e.g. p300, ALY, mSin3A, TLE, and HDAC6) to regulate tissue-specific gene expression (13Hess J.

Runx1-dependent trans-activation of the T cell receptor enhancer is also increased indirectly by DNA-binding proteins, such as LEF1,1 which bends DNA to facilitate long distance cooperative interactions between Runx1 and Ets1 (17Giese K. Kingsley C. Kirshner J.R. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 995-1008Google Scholar, 18Mayall T.P. Sheridan P.L. Montminy M.R. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 887-899Google Scholar). LEF1 is a high mobility group (HMG) protein and nuclear effector of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (19Hsu S.C. Galceran J. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4807-4818Google Scholar, 20Porfiri E. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Hovanes K. Waterman M. Polakis P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2833-2839Google Scholar). LEF1 binds the consensus DNA sequence C/TCTTTGAA in the minor groove, creates a 130° bend in the double helix, and alters of binding of other transcription factors to neighboring sites (17Giese K. Kingsley C. Kirshner J.R. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 995-1008Google Scholar, 21Giese K. Amsterdam A. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2567-2578Google Scholar). LEF1 transcriptional activity is regulated by interactions with transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors. In the absence of Wnt signals, LEF1 binds to transcriptional co-repressors TLE, CtBP, and HDACs to inhibit gene expression (22van Noort M. Clevers H. Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 1-8Google Scholar). Wnts convert LEF1 into a transcriptional activator by stimulating the disassembly of the GSK-3-Axin-APC multi-protein complex to prevent ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ॆ-catenin (22van Noort M. Clevers H. Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 1-8Google Scholar, 23Brantjes H. Barker N. van E.J. Clevers H. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 255-261Google Scholar). Increased ॆ-catenin expression facilitates its translocation to the nucleus where it displaces co-repressors from LEF1, binds LEF1, and recruits co-activators to induce gene transcription (22van Noort M. Clevers H. Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 1-8Google Scholar, 23Brantjes H. Barker N. van E.J. Clevers H. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 255-261Google Scholar). LEF1, c-myc, and cyclin D1 are among many genes whose promoters are activated by the Wnt/ॆ-catenin/LEF1 pathway (24He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J.

It was recently demonstrated that this canonical pathway also directly represses gene transcription in a manner dependent upon Wnt concentrations. In Drosophila, Wnt/wingless (Wg) induces Armadillo (ॆ-catenin homologue) and dTCF1/Pangolin (LEF1 homologues) to repress transcription of shavenbaby, stripe,decapentaplegic, and daughterless (27Cadigan K.M.

The mechanism of Wnt-induced transcriptional repression through LEF1-binding sites has not yet been defined, but these studies demonstrate that Wnts stimulate multiple, complex nuclear events. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway regulates bone density by regulating postnatal osteoblast proliferation (31Moon R.T. Bowerman B. Boutros M. Perrimon N. Science. 2002; 296: 1644-1646Google Scholar). Inactivating mutations in Wnt receptor, LRP5, decrease bone mass accrual during growth and cause the autosomal-recessive disorder osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome in humans and mice by decreasing osteoblast proliferation and without altering Runx2 mRNA levels (32Gong Y.

The downstream effects of Wnt signaling on osteoblast-specific gene transcription have not yet been described. In this report, we demonstrate that Runx2-dependent activation of the most osteoblast-specific gene, osteocalcin, is repressed by LEF1. A constitutively activated ॆ-catenin protein enhances LEF1-mediated repression of Runx2. These data suggest that in addition to stimulating osteoblast proliferation, the Wnt signaling pathway may slow differentiation by inhibiting Runx2 activity.

Mutant mOG2-luc reporters were generated using QuikChange (Stratagene) and gene-specific oligonucleotides containing mutations in the Runt and LEF1-binding sites (mutations are depicted in Fig. 1A; primer sequences are available upon request.) The murine preosteoblast cell line MC3T3 (clone E1, passage 20 or less), murine mesenchymal precursor cell line C3H10T1/2, and rat osteosarcoma cell line UMR-106 (clone 106.01) were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum, 292 mg/liter l-glutamine, 1× nonessential amino acids, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin. Prior to transfection, MC3T3 and C3H10T1/2 were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1.25 × 105 cells/well. UMR-106 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 7 × 104 cells/well. MC3T3, C3H10T1/2, and UMR-106 cells were transiently transfected with mOG2-luc (300 ng, 6-well; 100 ng, 12-well), pRL-TK (50 ng, 6-well; 5 ng, 12-well) or pCMV-SEAP (500 ng, 6-well), and expression plasmids pCMV5-LEF1-HA, pCMV5-Runx2 (MRIPV or MASNS isoform), and ॆ-catenin as indicated with either LipofectAMINE or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and as directed by the manufacturer. COS cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran. For differentiation assays, MC3T3 cells were seeded at a concentration of 2000 cells/cm2 and cultured in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum, 50 ॖg/ml ascorbic acid, 10 mm ॆ-glycerol phosphate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin. MC3T3 cells grown on coverslips were washed twice with PBS and fixed at room temperature for 30 min in 47 paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were lysed for 5 min at room temperature in 0.37 Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked for 30 min at room temperature in immunofluorescence solution (37 bovine serum albumin, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.37 Tween 20, PBS). The cells were then incubated with either anti-LEF-1 (REMB1, Exalpha Biologicals) or anti-ॆ-catenin (BD Biosciences) diluted to 1 ॖg/ml in immunofluorescence solution for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. Excess primary antibody was removed by washing three times for 5 min in PBS with 0.17 Triton X-100. The cells were incubated for 30 min with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 546 (1:50 dilution in immunofluorescence solution) at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. Excess secondary antibody was removed by washing three times for 5 min in PBS with 0.17 Triton X-100. The nuclei were stained with 5 ॖg/ml Hoescht 3258 for 5 min. The coverslips were mounted on glass microscope slides and viewed with fluorescence microscopy. The cells were harvested 2 days post-transfection, and luciferase expression was measured using a luciferase assay kit or a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to either human placental secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) or Renilla luciferase. SEAP values were determined as previously described (38Westendorf J.J. Yamamoto C.M. Lenny N. Downing J.R. Selsted M.E. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 322-333Google Scholar). LEF1 proteins werein vitro transcribed and translated from pPCR-Script-LEF1 in the presence of 35S-labeled amino acids using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega). GST and GST-Runx fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and extracted in lysis buffer A (10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.57 Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 50 ॖg/ml ethidium bromide as indicated) with sonication. GST proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with radiolabeled LEF1 proteins in the presence or absence of 50 ॖg/ml ethidium bromide. The beads were then washed three times with buffer A, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, boiled, and pelleted by centrifugation. The proteins in the supernatant were resolved by SDS-87 PAGE. The gel was fixed with 407 methanol and 107 acetic acid, incubated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to film. Double-stranded probes derived from the mOG2 osteocalcin promoter (wild type sequence: 5′-TTCAATCACCAACCACAGCATCCTTTGGGTTTGAC-3′) were end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP using Klenow DNA polymerase. COS cell lysates (5 mg) expressing Runx2 or LEF1 (HA-tagged) were incubated with an equal volume of 2× probe mix (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm KCl, 8.257 Ficoll, 12.5 ॖg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 41.25 pg/ml probe) at room temperature for 30 min. For supershift assays, 240 ॖg/ml of anti-Runx2 (39Meyers S. Lenny N. Sun W. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 303-312Google Scholar) or HA antiserum (Sigma) was added to the binding reaction for 30 min on ice. Unlabeled consensus binding sites for either Runx (5′-AATTCGAGTATTGTGGTTAATACG-3′) or LEF1 (5′-AATTCCGGCCTTTGATCTTTGCTA-3′) were used at a concentration of 100× the probe concentration to compete with binding to the labeled probe. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by nondenaturing 47 acrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. In an effort to discover novel mechanisms that regulate Runx2-dependenttrans-activity, we identified a sequence adjacent to the crucial proximal Runx2-binding site on the murine osteocalcin promoter, mOG2 (37Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar), that resembles the consensus LEF1 recognition site (Fig.1A). The LEF1 recognition sequence was separated from the proximal Runx-binding site by just four base pairs. The LEF1 binding sequence and its relative location to the Runx site are conserved in mouse, rat, and human osteocalcin promoters. To determine whether LEF1 binds the mOG2 promoter, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed with radiolabeled DNA probes containing mOG2 residues, −144 to −110 (Fig. 1A). COS lysates expressing LEF1-HA produced two complexes that hindered the migration of the probe (Fig. 1B). These bands were specifically competed with either unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a wild type LEF (L) consensus binding site or HA-specific antibodies. Oligonucleotides containing a mutant LEF-binding site (mtL) or a Runx2 antibody did not alter the LEF complexes (Fig. 1B). Runx2 lysates produced a single band when incubated with the mOG2 probe. This band was specifically competed by the addition of 100-fold excess unlabeled wild type Runx (R) consensus binding site, and its migration was hindered by Runx2-specific antisera. The Runx2 complex was not altered by anti-HA antibodies or by unlabeled oligonucleotides containing a scrambled Runx-binding site or the wild type LEF1-binding site. These data demonstrate that LEF1 specifically interacts with the osteocalcin promoter. Because the LEF1- and Runx2-binding sites are separated by only four base pairs, we examined the effects of LEF1 on the transcriptional activity of Runx2. MC3T3 (murine pre-osteoblasts), C3H10T1/2 (murine mesenchymal precursors), or UMR-106 (rat osteosarcoma) cells were transiently transfected with the mOG2-luciferase reporter in the presence or absence of Runx2 and/or LEF1 expression plasmids. Consistent with data previously reported by others (37Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar, 40Banerjee C. Hiebert S.W. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4968-4973Google Scholar), Runx2 proteins with amino-terminal sequences of either MRIPV or MASNSL activated the mOG2 promoter ∼4-fold in MC3T3 cells (Fig. 2). LEF1 did not significantly alter the basal activity of the wild type mOG2 reporter. However, LEF1 blocked the activation induced by either Runx2 isoform (Fig.2A). LEF1 similarly repressed Runx2-dependent activation of mOG2 in osteoblast precursor C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig.2B) and in UMR-106 osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 2C). The inhibition was dependent on the amount of LEF1 expression plasmids added to UMR-106 and MC3T3 cells (Fig. 2, C andD). Complete inhibition was observed when equal amounts of LEF1 and Runx2 expression plasmids were co-transfected into these cells. Importantly, co-expression of LEF1 did not suppress Runx2 protein levels (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that LEF1 represses Runx2 activity in osteoblasts, thereby defining a novel intermolecular mechanism that may regulate Runx2 activity during differentiation and a functional role for LEF1 in osteoblasts. To determine the requirement of the LEF1-binding site in osteocalcin regulation, we made point mutations in the mOG2 EMSA probes and luciferase reporter constructs that disrupt the binding sites for LEF1, Runx2, or both factors (Fig. 3A). The mutations completely eliminated DNA binding of the respective transcription factor(s) without affecting the DNA binding ability of the other (Fig. 3B). Mutations in the Runx2-binding site decreased basal activity of mOG2 (Fig. 3C). This result is consistent with reports from other laboratories (37Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar, 40Banerjee C. Hiebert S.W. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4968-4973Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations in the LEF1-binding site increased the basal activity of the mOG2-luciferase reporter in MC3T3 cells by 2–3-fold (Fig. 3C). Immunoblot and in situimmunofluorescence analyses indicated that MC3T3 cells express LEF1 in their nuclei (Fig. 3, D and E). These data indicate that endogenous LEF1 suppresses the basal activity of mOG2 in osteoblasts. This is consistent with the role of LEF1 as a transcriptional repressor in the absence of Wnt signals (22van Noort M. Clevers H. Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 1-8Google Scholar). We next utilized the mOG2 mutant reporter constructs to begin to determine the mechanism by which LEF1 represses Runx2. MC3T3 cells were transiently transfected with wild type or mutant mOG2 reporters in the presence or absence of Runx2 and LEF1 expression plasmids. Because basal activities of the mutant reporter constructs differed (Fig. 3), the data were normalized to the activity of the indicated mOG2 reporter in the absence of Runx2 and LEF1 expression plasmids (Fig.4). As previously demonstrated, Runx2 activates the wild type mOG2 promoter ∼3-fold (Fig. 4A,top panel). The Runx2-binding site is necessary for Runx2 activation (Fig. 4A, second and fourth panelsfrom top). However, mutations in the LEF1-binding site did not significantly affect Runx2-dependent activation (Fig.4A, third panel from top). Surprisingly, the LEF1-binding site was also not required for LEF1-mediated repression of Runx2 (Fig. 4A, third panel from top). To confirm that LEF1-binding sites are not necessary for repression, we tested the effects of LEF1 on Runx2-driven expression of an artificial promoter, p6OSE2 (37Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar), which contains six Runx-binding elements upstream of the minimal osteocalcin promoter (−34/+13) and luciferase, and has no recognizable LEF1-binding sites. Runx2 activated the p6OSE2 reporter by more than 10-fold (Fig. 4B). LEF1 did not affect the basal activity of the reporter but repressed Runx2-induced activation ∼4-fold. In contrast, LEF1 did not inhibit GAL or GAL-VP16 activity on a GAL-responsive promoter, pAH205 (Fig. 4C). Thus, LEF1 specifically inhibits Runx2, and the LEF1 DNA binding is not required for repression of Runx2-dependent activation of the mOG2 promoter. To determine how LEF1 is suppressing Runx2, we considered five potential mechanisms of transcriptional repression: 1) competition for DNA binding sites, 2) squelching of the basal transcriptional machinery, 3) quenching of the activation properties of DNA-bound Runx2, 4) indirect transcriptional repression by complexing with Runx2 and preventing DNA binding, and 5) co-repressor recruitment (41Latchman D.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 965-974Google Scholar, 42Mannervik M. Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1999; 284: 606-609Google Scholar, 43Ezashi T. Ghosh D. Roberts R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7883-7891Google Scholar). Competition is unlikely because a DNA probe containing just the Runx-binding element does not compete with a mOG2 probe for LEF1 (Fig. 1B), and LEF1 does not bind to a Runx2-specific probe (data not shown). Squelching also does not appear to be the mechanism because ectopic LEF1 did not repress the basal activity of the wild type mOG2 promoter (Fig. 2). To further explore the possibility that LEF1 quenches or indirectly represses Runx2, we asked whether LEF1 physically interacts with Runx2. Using a panel of Runx2 and Runx1 GST fusion proteins (Fig.5A), we found that LEF1 interacts with the amino termini of both Runt domain proteins. The Runt homology domain (RHD; Runx1 residues 50–179), which mediates DNA binding, is necessary and sufficient to interact with full-length LEF1 in vitro (Fig. 5B). A single point mutation, L148D, in the Runx1 RHD that eliminates DNA binding (44Lenny N. Meyers S. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1761-1769Google Scholar) also prevented LEF1 interactions. We then mapped the Runx-binding site in LEF1 with a panel of LEF1 truncation mutants (Fig.5A). Neither the ॆ-catenin-binding domain nor the extreme carboxyl terminus was necessary for LEF1 to interact with the RHD (residues 50–179) (Fig. 5C). The HMG domain, however, was required and sufficient to interact with the RHD. This interaction persisted in the presence of ethidium bromide, indicating that intermolecular association between respective DNA-binding domains of LEF1 and Runx2 is not mediated by DNA present in the reactions (Fig.5C, right panel). These data demonstrate a novel interaction between the nuclear LEF1 and Runx2 and suggest that LEF1 indirectly represses Runx2 activity by binding its DNA-binding domain. To determine the regions of LEF1 required for repressing Runx2 activity and to test the fifth potential mechanism of repression (i.e. co-repressor recruitment), we assayed the LEF1 and Runx2 truncation mutants in the mOG2 transcription assay. The LEF1 and Runx2 proteins used in these experiments are diagrammed in Fig. 6A. All LEF1 and Runx2 proteins localized to cell nuclei (data not shown). The LEF1-HMG domain, which interacts with Runx2, was necessary for repression of Runx2 transcriptional activity (Fig. 6B). The HMG and a LEF1 protein lacking the extreme carboxyl terminus (ΔC) also partially blocked Runx2-dependent activation but was not as effective as full-length LEF1 (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that additional regions of LEF1 are required for maximal repression. This hypothesis was supported by experiments with a LEF1 protein lacking the ॆ-catenin binding domain (Δॆ-cat), which did not repress Runx2-dependent transcription (Fig. 6B). Thus, the HMG is required for LEF1 to repress transcription, but the ॆ-catenin-binding domain also contributes to repression. Both Runx2 and LEF1 bind the TLE co-repressors (45Levanon D. Goldstein R.E. Bernstein Y. Tang H. Goldenberg D. Stifani S. Paroush Z. Groner Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11590-11595Google Scholar). To determine whether LEF1 interacts with TLE proteins that are recruited to the promoter by the Runx2 carboxyl terminus to repress transcription, we determined the effects of LEF1 proteins on a truncated Runx2 protein (1–498) that lacks the TLE-binding domain. Runx2 (1–498) retains the DNA binding and activation domains and thus activated mOG2 by 5-fold (Fig. 6D). LEF1 and LEF1-HMG had similar effects on Runx2 (1–498) as they did on wild type Runx2. Thus, LEF1 completely blocked Runx2 (1–498) activity, and the LEF1-HMG, which lacks the TLE-binding domain, partially repressed it (Fig. 6D). These data indicate that TLE recruitment is not required for LEF1-mediated repression of Runx2; however, the possibility that TLE may contri"

The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signal pathway for local cell-cell communication between neighboring cells involved in cell fate determination (11Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Google Scholar). The Notch receptors undergo proteolytic processing in the trans-Golgi network by a furin-like convertase in the ectodomain (12Logeat F. Bessia C. Brou C. LeBail O. Jarriault S. Seiday N. Israel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1997; 90: 281-291Google Scholar). Ligand binding triggers sequential proteolytic processing within the extracellular juxtamembrane region by a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain) family, termed TACE (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α-converting enzyme) (14Brou C.

Annaertm W. Cuper P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijver V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Google Scholar). The resulting soluble cytoplasmic domain, termed S3/NICD (Notch intracellular domain), translocates to the nucleus and interacts with the DNA-binding proteins CSL, resulting in transcriptional activation of target genes (16Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Google Scholar, 17Struhl G. Adachi A. Cell. 1998; 93: 649-660Google Scholar). Several Notch ligands have been identified in vertebrates and invertebrates, including Delta, Serrate, and Jagged, transmembrane proteins that share several structural features including a DSL (Delta, Serrate, Lag-2) domain, required for Notch binding, and multiple epidermal growth factor-like repeats in respective extracellular domains (18Grace G.E. Mann R.S. Mitsiadis E. Henrique D. Carcangiu M.-L. Banks A. Leiman J. Ward D. Ish-Horowitz D. Artavanis-Tsakonas A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 165: 785-794Google Scholar, 19Lindsell C.E. Shawber C.J. Boulter J. Weinmaster G. Cell. 1995; 80: 909-917Google Scholar). Like Notch, Delta is a substrate for proteolysis by a metalloprotease of the ADAM family, termed Kuzbanian (20Qi H. Rand M.D. Wu X. Sestan N. Wang W. Rakic P. Xu T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Science. 1999; 283: 91-94Google Scholar), resulting in shedding of the ectodomain segment. The precise role of Kuzbanian-dependent proteolytic processing of Delta is not fully understood, but recent studies suggest that this event down-regulates Delta-mediated Notch signaling (21Mishra-Gorur K. Rand M.D. Perez-Villamil B. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 313-324Google Scholar). In this regard, ectodomain shedding of Jagged has not been described to date. In this report, we demonstrate that like Notch, Delta1 and Jagged2, are subject to presenilin (PS)-dependent, γ-secretase processing, resulting in the production of soluble intracellular derivatives. We show that a plasma membrane-resident ∼40 kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTF) that is presumably generated by a Kuzbanian-like activity serves as substrate for γ-secretase, resulting in the liberation of a cytosolic, ∼38-kDa CTF. We demonstrate that expression of a Delta1-Gal4VP16 chimera is capable of activating transcription of a luciferase reporter and that nuclear transactivation is abrogated by a highly potent and selective γ-secretase inhibitor. In parallel, we demonstrate that a ∼27-kDa Jagged2 CTF is also a substrate for γ-secretase. Our findings suggest that Delta1 and Jagged2 may play dual roles as activators of Notch receptor signaling and as receptors that mediate nuclear signaling events via γ-secretase-generated cytoplasmic domains. Finally, we report that expression of FAD-linked PS1 variants lead to compromised intramembranous cleavage of Delta1. These observations mimic earlier studies showing reduced cleavage at the Notch S3 site and the APP “ε” site within respective transmembrane domains in cells expressing FAD-linked mutant PS1. Thus, we argue that a similar molecular apparatus is responsible for intramembranous cleavage of Notch and it's ligand, Delta1. Mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells stably expressing mouse Delta1 and NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing human Jagged2 with a COOH-terminal Myc-epitope tag, were maintained in 200 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and 2.5 μg/ml puromycin (Clontech), respectively. γ-Secretase inhibitor treatments were for 16 h with 2 μm of L-685,458 (22Shearman M.S.

Mouse N2a cells constitutively expressing Myc-epitope Swedish APP695 (23Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

Hygromycin-resistant colonies were further screened with 400 μg/ml of zeocin to generate a stable “pool” of ∼100–200 colonies. Cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer containing detergents and protease inhibitors as described (24Kim S.-H. Leem J.Y. Lah J.J. Slunt H.H. Levey A.I. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

Solubilized proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked and then probed with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Pierce). Myc-tagged Delta1 and Jagged2 derivatives were detected using monoclonal Myc specific antibody, 9E10. Polyclonal antibody, PS1NT (25Thinakaran G. Getard F.B. Bouton C.M.L. Harris C.L. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. Neurobiol. Dis. 1998; 4: 438-453Google Scholar), was used to detect full-length PS1 and PS1 NH2-terminal fragment. β-Tubulin was detected by anti-β-Tubulin antibody (Sigma). Bound antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (PerkinElmer Life Science). Cells were grown to near confluence in a 10-cm dish and subjected to cell surface biotinylation with 0.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimodobiotin (Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, Pierce) essentially as described previously (24Kim S.-H. Leem J.Y. Lah J.J. Slunt H.H. Levey A.I. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43343-43350Google Scholar). Cells were then lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer, and biotinylated proteins were captured with streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce). To generate a construct encoding the Delta1-Gal4VP16 fusion protein, the primer pairs, 5′-CCATCGATTTAAGAAGCTACTGTCTTCTATC-3′ and 5′-CCATCGATCACCGTCCTCGTCAATTCC-3′, were incubated with pMst-GV-APP (26Cao X. Südhof T. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Google Scholar) in a PCR. The PCR product was inserted between the Delta1 COOH terminus and Myc sequences. 0.4 μg of the resulting Delta1-Gal4VP16-Myc construct was cotransfected the Gal4 reporter plasmid (pG5E1B-luci) (26Cao X. Südhof T. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Google Scholar), and 50 ng of a control plasmid encoding Rellina luciferase into HEK293 cells. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activities were determined using dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) following manufacture's instructions. Values shown are the averages from triplicate experiments for each condition. The family of Notch receptors and Notch ligands are type I integral membrane proteins. It is now well established that Notch and the Notch ligand, Delta1, are substrates for processing by metalloproteases of the TACE/ADAM family (14Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O. Doedens J.R. Cumano A. Roux P. Black R.A. Israel A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 207-216Google Scholar, 15Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A. Tian X. Pan D.J. Ray W.J. Kopan R. Mol.

Science. 1999; 283: 91-94Google Scholar), resulting in shedding of respective ectodomains. In the case of Notch, TACE cleavage generates a membrane-tethered derivative, termed S2/NEXT, that is the substrate for intramembranous proteolysis by a presenilin-dependent γ-secretase activity (4De Strooper B. Annaertm W. Cuper P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijver V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Google Scholar). This cleavage event, termed S3 cleavage, occurs between amino acids 1743 and 1744 (16Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Google Scholar); the P1 valine residue is indispensable for S3 cleavage and subsequent nuclear signaling activity (16Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Google Scholar). Intramembranous cleavage at the S3 site results in the generation of a soluble, cytoplasmic derivative of Notch, termed S3/NICD, that is a transcriptional coactivator. Intrigued by the finding that Delta1 undergoes ectodomain shedding, and the presence of valine residues at analogous positions within the transmembrane domains of Delta1 and the Jagged2 (Fig.1 A), we asked whether these Notch ligands may be substrates for γ-secretase cleavage, as well. We first examined stable N2a cells that constitutively express Myc-tagged mouse Delta1 harboring a carboxyl-terminal, Myc-epitope tag. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of full-length ∼117-kDa Delta1-Myc and a prominent ∼40-kDa Delta1 carboxyl-terminal fragment (D-CTF1) that presumably represents the membrane-tethered fragment generated following metalloprotease cleavage within the ectodomain (20Qi H. Rand M.D. Wu X. Sestan N. Wang W. Rakic P. Xu T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Science. 1999; 283: 91-94Google Scholar, 21Mishra-Gorur K. Rand M.D. Perez-Villamil B. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 313-324Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). In addition, we observed low levels of a ∼38-kDa CTF (D-CTF2) at steady state (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). Importantly, the ∼38-kDa D-CTF2 derivative fails to accumulate in cells treated with a highly potent and selective γ-secretase inhibitor, L-685,458 (Fig. 1 B, lane 2), findings strongly suggesting that this fragments is generated by γ-secretase. To further establish that production of D-CTF2 is PS-dependent, we transiently expressed Delta1-Myc in N2a cells that constitutively express either wild-type human PS1 or a dominant negative human PS1 variant that harbors the D385A mutation (24Kim S.-H. Leem J.Y. Lah J.J. Slunt H.H. Levey A.I. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43343-43350Google Scholar); intramembranous processing of Notch1 is abrogated in cells expressing PS1 D385A (24Kim S.-H. Leem J.Y. Lah J.J. Slunt H.H. Levey A.I. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43343-43350Google Scholar). As we had observed in cells treated with the γ-secretase inhibitor, D-CTF2 failed to accumulate in cells expressing PS1 D385A (Fig. 2 B,lane 4). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that Delta1 is a substrate of PS-dependent, γ-secretase cleavage. We then examined the processing of the Notch ligand, Jagged2, in an NIH 3T3 cell line that stably expresses human Jagged2 harboring a carboxyl-terminal Myc-epitope tag. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of ∼170-kDa full-length Jagged2 and an ∼25-kDa Jagged2 carboxyl-terminal fragment (J-CTF2) (Fig.1 C, lane 1). However, the ∼25-kDa CTF2 was eliminated in cells treated with the γ-secretase inhibitor, L-685,458, and interestingly, a new ∼27-kDa J-CTF1 accumulates under these conditions (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). These findings suggest that J-CTF1 is constitutively processed by a γ-secretase-like activity, to generate J-CTF2. To establish that production of J-CTF2 is PS-dependent, we transiently expressed Jagged2-Myc into N2a cells that express the PS1 D385A mutation (24Kim S.-H. Leem J.Y. Lah J.J. Slunt H.H. Levey A.I. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43343-43350Google Scholar). As we had observed in cells treated with the γ-secretase inhibitor, the production of J-CTF2 is eliminated, and J-CTF1 now accumulates (Fig. 1 C, lane 4). These results indicate that Jagged2 is also a substrate of PS-dependent γ-secretase cleavage. To identify the subcellular site(s) at which the D-CTF2 and D-CTF1 derivatives of Delta1-Myc accumulate, we treated N2a cells that constitutively express Delta1-Myc with the membrane-impermeant, biotinylation reagent, sulfosuccinimidobiotin at 4 °C. Biotinylated, cell surface polypeptides were recovered from detergent-solubilized lysates using streptavidin-conjugated agarose, and captured proteins were subject to Western blot analysis with the Myc-specific, 9E10 antibody. In cells expressing Delta1-Myc, we observed biotinylated full-length Delta1-Myc and ∼40-kDa D-CTF1 (Fig.2 A, lane 5). However, the ∼38-kDa D-CTF2 was not recovered by immobilized streptavidin, despite the presence of the fragment in detergent lysates (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). Hence, D-CTF2, like the Notch S3/NICD derivative is not present at the cell surface, but presumably present in the cytosol. Moreover, D-CTF2 failed to accumulate in cells treated with the γ-secretase inhibitor, as expected, and streptavidin only recovered both full-length and ∼40-kDa D-CTF1 from detergent lysates of these inhibitor-treated cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). These observations strongly suggest that the soluble, cytoplasmic domain of Delta1 is generated following sequential cleavage of full-length Delta1 species by the concerted action of Kuzbanian-like metalloprotease(s) and a PS-dependent γ-secretase. It is now clear that the soluble intracellular domains of Notch and APP that are generated by γ-secretase are translocated to the nucleus and serve as transcriptional coactivators (16Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Google Scholar, 17Struhl G. Adachi A. Cell. 1998; 93: 649-660Google Scholar, 26Cao X. Südhof T. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Google Scholar). To test the possibility that D-CTF2 could be transported to nucleus, and exhibit nuclear signaling activity, we generated cDNA encoding a Delta1-Gal4VP16 fusion protein and transfected this construct into human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells together with the reporter plasmid, pG5E1B-luciferase (26Cao X. Südhof T. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Google Scholar). Compared with cells expressing the pG5E1B vector, expression of Delta1-Gal4VP16 fusion protein stimulated transcription by ∼70-fold (Fig. 2 B). Notably, transactivation of the reporter plasmid by the Delta1-Gal4VP16 fusion protein was markedly inhibited upon treatment of cells with the γ-secretase inhibitor (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that intracellular domain of Delta1 that is generated by PS-dependent γ-secretase cleavage can be transported into nucleus, findings that raise the possibility that the cytosolic derivative of Delta1 may play a role in nuclear signaling events. Finally, and intrigued by the finding that cells expressing FAD-linked PS1 mutants enhance production of pathogenic β-amyloid 42 peptides (1Price D.L. Tanzi R.E. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 461-493Google Scholar), but exhibit impaired processing within the transmembrane domains of Notch and APP that liberate NICD and AICD, respectively (27Moehlmann T. Winkler E. Xia X. Edbauer D. Murrell J. Capell A. Kaether C. Zheng H. Ghetti B. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8025-8030Google Scholar, 28Chen F. Gu Y.J. Hasegawa H. Ruan X. Arawaka S. Fraser P. Westaway D. Mount H. St. George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36521-36526Google Scholar, 29Song W. Nadeau P. Yuan M. Yang X. Shen J. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6959-6963Google Scholar), we analyzed processing of Delta1-Myc in pools of N2a cells that constitutively express human wild-type PS1 or the PS1 ΔE9, M146L, E280A, or C410Y FAD variants. Compared with N2a cells expressing wild-type human PS1 (Fig. 3 A,lane 1), in which Delta1-Myc was processed to D-CTF1 and low levels of D-CTF2, as described above (Fig. 1 B), the production of the D-CTF2 fragment is reduced in most cell lines expressing FAD-linked PS1 variants, albeit with only a modest effect in the M146L cells (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2–5, quantified in Fig. 3 B), this despite comparable levels of expression of human PS1 (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). Taken together with the curious observation that expression of FAD-linked PS1 variants leads to reduced processing at the Notch S3 and APP ε sites, our findings that production of the D-CTF2 derived from Delta1 is also reduced by expression of mutant PS1 argues that a similar, if not identical, molecular apparatus is involved in substrate recognition and intramembranous processing of these functionally divergent membrane proteins. A wealth of evidence has emerged to support a role for PS in intramembranous γ-secretase processing of a host of type I membrane proteins. Intrigued by the similarity in the amino acid sequence of the transmembrane domains of Notch and it's ligands, Delta and Jagged, we hypothesized that these ligands might also serve as substrates for γ-secretase. In the present report, we confirm our prediction and offer several insights relevant to the molecular apparatus responsible for intramembranous processing of Delta1 and Jagged2 and the potential functional significance of this processing event. First, we demonstrate that the production of cytosolic derivatives of Delta1 and Jagged2, termed DICD and JICD, respectively, are inhibited either by a highly potent, and selective transition-state isostere of γ-secretase activity or by expression of the dominant negative D385A PS1 mutant. Thus, the Notch ligands, Delta1 and Jagged2, are novel substrates of PS-dependent γ-secretase processing. Second, and in view of earlier demonstrations that FAD-linked PS1 mutations impair cleavage at the Notch S3 and APP ε sites that lead to production of S3/NICD and AICD (27Moehlmann T. Winkler E. Xia X. Edbauer D. Murrell J. Capell A. Kaether C. Zheng H. Ghetti B. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8025-8030Google Scholar, 28Chen F. Gu Y.J. Hasegawa H. Ruan X. Arawaka S. Fraser P. Westaway D. Mount H. St. George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36521-36526Google Scholar, 29Song W. Nadeau P. Yuan M. Yang X. Shen J. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6959-6963Google Scholar), respectively, we assessed the effects of FAD-linked PS1 variants on γ-secretase processing of Delta1. We show that the generation of DICD is impaired in most of cell lines stably expressing four independent FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Most interestingly, the relative levels of reduction in DICD parallel the reported effects on S3/NICD production (29Song W. Nadeau P. Yuan M. Yang X. Shen J. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6959-6963Google Scholar); expression of the C410Y variant has the most pronounced effect, while the M146L variant has only a modest effect on γ-secretase processing. Thus, we argue that the molecular apparatus involved in production of NICD, AICD, and DICD are similar, if not one in the same. Third, and in view of earlier conclusions that the intracellular domains of Notch (S3/NICD) and APP (AICD) are transcriptional coactivators (16Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Google Scholar, 17Struhl G. Adachi A. Cell. 1998; 93: 649-660Google Scholar, 24Kim S.-H. Leem J.Y. Lah J.J. Slunt H.H. Levey A.I. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43343-43350Google Scholar), we hypothesized that γ-secretase-generated DICD could be translocated to the nucleus and activate transcription of a reporter gene. Our present results support this prediction. Despite the strengths of these observations, the factors responsible for translocating DICD into the nucleus are not known. For the APP derivative, AICD, a cytosolic adaptor protein, Fe65, promotes nuclear translocation (24Kim S.-H. Leem J.Y. Lah J.J. Slunt H.H. Levey A.I. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43343-43350Google Scholar). For Notch1, three putative nuclear localization signals (NLS) are present within the ICD, and these may serve as recognition motifs by members of the importin/karyopherin α and β receptors involved in nuclear import. Similarly, the Delta1 intracellular domain contains two putative NLSs,PDRKRPE at amino acids 686–692, andRKRP at amino acids 688–691, while the Jagged2 intracellular domain contains putative NLSs RKRR at amino acids 1107–1110, and KRRK at 1108–1111. Hence, it is conceivable that DICD and JICD may be imported via the classical importin pathway, but further mutagenesis studies of the putative NLSs will be required to validate this hypothesis. In any event, our results offer the suggestion that PS-dependent γ-secretase processing of Delta1 or Jagged2 and production of DICD and JICD may play roles in activating nuclear transcriptional events. While the significance of these findings in relation to cell-intrinsic versus cell-extrinsic aspects of Notch signaling remains to be determined, the proposal that the Notch ligands, Delta1 and Jagged2, may perform roles both as ligands and receptors that directly participate in transcriptional activation warrants further investigation. We are grateful to Drs. J. S. Nye and J. Sklar for providing cell lines expressing Delta1 and Jagged2, respectively."

Y., Cafferty, P. W., Sobue, K., Agarwal-Mawal, A., Neufield, K. D., and Paudel, H. K. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 11933–11940). In this study, we find that when purified brain microtubules are subjected to Superose 12 gel filtration column chromatography, the dimeric scaffold protein 14-3-3ζ co-elutes with the tau phosphorylation complex components tau and GSK3β. From gel filtration fractions containing the tau phosphorylation complex, 14-3-3ζ, GSK3β, and tau co-immunoprecipitate with each other. From extracts of bovine brain, COS-7 cells, and HEK-293 cells transfected with GSK3β, 14-3-3ζ co-precipitates with GSK3β, indicating that GSK3β binds to 14-3-3ζ. From HEK-293 cells transfected with tau, GSK3β, and 14-3-3ζ in different combinations, tau co-immunoprecipitates with GSK3β only in the presence of 14-3-3ζ. In vitro, ∼10-fold more tau binds to GSK3β in the presence of than in the absence of 14-3-3ζ. In transfected HEK-293 cells, 14-3-3ζ stimulates GSK3β-catalyzed tau phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. These data indicate that in brain, the 14-3-3ζ dimer simultaneously binds and bridges tau and GSK3β and stimulates GSK3β-catalyzed tau phosphorylation.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 71-84Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In neurons, tau is one of the major microtubule-associated proteins and is mainly found in the axonal compartment (for reviews, see Refs. 1Hirokawa N. Curr. Opin.

Studies suggest that tau regulates microtubule dynamics, axonal transport, and neuronal morphology by binding and stabilizing the microtubule structure (1Hirokawa N. Curr. Opin.

There are six tau isoforms, which migrate with sizes 45–65 kDa on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. These isoforms are phosphorylated on multiple sites in the brain and display a characteristic retarded mobility on an SDS gel upon phosphorylation (2Lee V.M.-Y. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev.

Tau phosphorylation reduces the affinity of tau for microtubules and is one of the mechanisms that control microtubule structure and dynamics in vivo (1Hirokawa N. Curr. Opin.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD)1brain, abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates and forms paired helical filaments (4Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K.

Science. 1991; 251: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Since abnormally phosphorylated tau does not bind to microtubules, abnormal tau phosphorylation in AD brain is thought to cause a loss of tau function, microtubule dysfunction, and neurodegeneration (2Lee V.M.-Y. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 24: 1121-1159Crossref Scopus (2162) Google Scholar, 3Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Garner C.C. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 193-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It is not understood how abnormally phosphorylated tau accumulates in AD brain, but a defect in the regulatory mechanism that controls tau phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is very likely to be involved. The elucidation of the regulatory mechanism that controls tau phosphorylation in normal brain and the determination of how this regulation fails in AD brain are essential steps in understanding disease ontogeny and developing therapeutic interventions. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is an important regulatory enzyme that phosphorylates numerous substrates and regulates diverse physiological processes such as glycogen metabolism, gene expression, apoptosis, signal transduction, and cell fate specification (6Kim L. Kimmel A.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 7Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Progress Neurobiol. (N.

There are two isoforms of GSK3 that are highly expressed in the brain: ∼51-kDa GSK3α and ∼47-kDa GSK3β (9Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). In transfected cells and transgenic mice, enhanced expression of GSK3β leads to tau phosphorylation and microtubule instability (10Wagner U. Utton M. Gallo J.M. Miller C.J. J.

These observations suggest that GSK3β phosphorylates tau in both normal and AD brain. Previous studies have shown that a large amount of GSK3β in brain is associated with microtubules (18Ishiguro K.

These data indicate that GSK3β phosphorylates tau within a microtubule-associated multiprotein complex (hereon designated as tau phosphorylation complex). The enormity of the tau phosphorylation complex suggests that within the complex, there may be proteins other than tau and GSK3β (20Sun W. Qureshi H.Y. Cafferty P.W. Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A.

The identification of all the complex components and the determination of their functions within the complex are essential to understanding the mechanism by which GSK3β phosphorylates tau in the brain. 14-3-3 is a family of conserved acidic proteins that are widely expressed in all eukaryotic tissues (21Fu H.

There are seven 14-3-3 isoforms, which are products of distinct genes. 14-3-3 is a naturally dimeric scaffold protein with the size of the monomer being ∼30 kDa (21Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Within the 14-3-3 dimer, the ligand binding grooves of each monomer run in opposite directions, and hence a 14-3-3 dimer can interconnect and bring two different proteins together. 14-3-3 binds to diverse cellular proteins, and more than 100 14-3-3 binding proteins have been identified (21Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 is a cofactor of bacterial toxin Pseudomonas (23Zhang L. Wang H.

By binding to its targets, 14-3-3 regulates enzyme activity, stabilizes enzyme conformation, controls subcellular localization of proteins, and mediates protein-protein interaction (21Fu H.

From bovine brain extract, 14-3-3ζ co-immunoprecipitates with tau (36Hashiguchi M. Sobue K. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25247-25254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In vitro, 14-3-3ζ binds and changes the tau conformation, thus making tau susceptible for kinase phosphorylation (36Hashiguchi M. Sobue K. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25247-25254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). More importantly, a substantial amount of 14-3-3ζ co-purifies with microtubules from the brain extract (36Hashiguchi M. Sobue K. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25247-25254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that 14-3-3ζ is an integral part of brain microtubules and is involved in the regulation of tau phosphorylation and microtubule dynamics. However, very little information is available about microtubule-associated 14-3-3ζ. In this study, we have further analyzed microtubule-associated 14-3-3ζ. Herein we report that brain microtubule-associated 14-3-3ζ is part of the tau phosphorylation complex containing GSK3β and tau. Our data indicate that 14-3-3ζ mediates GSK3β-tau interaction and facilitates tau phosphorylation by GSK3β within the complex. The longest human tau isoform in a pET-3a vector (38Sobue K.

After amplification, the insert was released and ligated into the EcoR1/BamHI cloning site of FLAG-pcDNA3.1 Zeo vector (Invitrogen, Madison, WI).

COS-7 and HEK-293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes, grown to ∼80% confluency, and transfected by standard calcium phosphate method with various amounts of the appropriate plasmids. For each 100-mm dish, 5–10 μg of DNA was mixed with 50 μl of CaCl2 (2.5m) to give a final volume of 500 μl with distilled water. The mixture of DNA and CaCl2 was added to 500 μl of 2× HEPES-buffered saline (1.63% NaCl, 1.188% Hepes, 0.02% Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2)), and the mixture was allowed to settle at 20 °C for 30 min. DNA mixture was added to the cells dropwise, and cells were allowed to grow for 12–18 h. The medium was then changed, and cells were incubated for 48–72 h. Recombinant tau was purified from bacterial extract overexpressing the longest human tau isoform (39Paudel H.K. J. Biol.

Purification of microtubules from a fresh bovine brain extract by the temperature-induced microtubule assembly/disassembly has been described previously (38Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Li W. Sun W.

Microtubule pellet obtained by centrifugation after first, second, third, and fourth cycles of assembly/disassembly were designated as P1, P2, P3, and P4, and the supernatants were designated as S1, S2, S3, and S4, respectively. For a partial purification of 14-3-3ζ, all procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Microtubule pellet P3 (∼4 mg) was homogenized in ∼10 ml of PEM buffer (0.1 m PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm DTT) containing 0.1 mm GTP using a glass homogenizer and then incubated in ice for 30 min. After incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant (∼12 ml) was loaded onto a phosphocellulose (Whatman) column (25 × 5 cm) equilibrated in PEM buffer. The column was washed extensively, and the column-bound 14-3-3ζ was eluted with 200 ml of NaCl gradient (0–1 m in PEM buffer). Effluent fractions were immunoblotted using anti-14-3-3ζ antibody, and those containing 14-3-3ζ were combined and dialyzed against Mops buffer (25 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2m NaCl, 10 mm NaF, and 15 mmMgCl2) for 4 h. Dialyzed sample was concentrated by Aquacide III (Calbiochem) and centrifuged at 27,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant (∼8 ml) was loaded onto an FPLC Superose 12 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column (2.6 × 50 cm), equilibrated, and eluted with Mops buffer. Effluent fractions (1 ml each) were collected, and those containing 14-3-3ζ were pooled and dialyzed against 15 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The dialyzed sample was loaded onto an FPLC Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm DTT. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer and then eluted with an NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m) in the equilibration buffer. Fractions (200 μl each) were collected, and those containing 14-3-3ζ were combined (∼1.5 ml) and chromatographed through a Sepharose 4B (Sigma) gel filtration column (2.5 × 60 cm) equilibrated and eluted with Mops buffer. Fractions (0.5 ml each) were collected. Cells in each culture dish were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 25 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 nm okadaic acid (Sigma), 50 pmcypermethrane (Calbiochem), 1 mm phenylmethulsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin). The cell suspension was incubated in ice for 1 h and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was either used for immunoprecipitation or used for GST pull-down assay. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatant (∼200 μl) was precleared with ∼50 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Sigma) equilibrated in lysis buffer. The precleared sample was mixed with 10 μg of indicated antibody, and the mixture was shaken end-over-end for 6 h at 4 °C. After shaking, 30 μl of protein G-agarose beads was added to the mixture, and the shaking was continued for another 5 h. The beads were then collected by centrifugation and washed three times (30 min each). The washed beads were dissolved in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and centrifuged, and 20 μl of supernatant was analyzed by immunoblot analysis using the indicated antibody. The immunoprecipitation procedure for generating Fig. 4 is essentially as described (20Sun W. Qureshi H.Y. Cafferty P.W. Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Neufield K.D. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11933-11940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To perform GST pull-down assay, ∼50 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) coated with the indicated protein was incubated with 200 μl of the cell or brain extract with end-over-end shaking for 14 h at 4 °C. After shaking, beads were washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmEDTA, and 1 mm DTT. The washed beads were dissolved in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and centrifuged, and 20 μl of the supernatant was analyzed by immunoblot analysis using the indicated antibody. To generate Fig. 7, the GST pull-down assay was carried out as described above, except the brain or cell extract was replaced by the tau sample (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, and 50 μg/ml tau). To examine microtubule-associated 14-3-3ζ, we purified microtubules from a fresh bovine brain extract using repeated cycles of temperature-induced microtubule assembly and disassembly. SDS-PAGE and an immunoblot analysis showed that microtubules were enriched during each cycle of assembly and disassembly (Fig. 1,A and B). An immunoblot analysis using an anti-14-3-3ζ antibody indicated that 14-3-3ζ was present in all the fractions in a manner similar to tubulin (Fig. 1C). By quantitating the intensities of various bands in Fig. 1, Band C, we determined that ∼6.6, ∼2.8, ∼0.96, and ∼0.3% of total 14-3-3ζ in brain extract remained associated with first (P1), second (P2), third (P3), and fourth (P4) microtubule pellets, respectively. The amount of tubulin was ∼29.5, ∼12.4, ∼7.2, and ∼3.0% of the total in P1, P2, P3, and P4, respectively (data not shown). More importantly, the ratio of the amount of 14-3-3ζ to the amount of tubulin in P1, P2, P3, and P4 was ∼0.23, ∼0.30, ∼0.20, and ∼0.16, respectively (Fig. 1D). Thus, a fraction of 14-3-3ζ remained stably associated with microtubules during purification in a manner similar to tubulin. These observations indicated that a significant amount of 14-3-3ζ is stably bound to microtubules in the brain. To further characterize microtubule-associated 14-3-3ζ, we depolymerized P3 microtubules by cold incubation and then subjected them to a phosphocellulose chromatography. 14-3-3ζ was not recovered within the flow-through fractions and eluted from the column with an NaCl gradient along with the other microtubule-associated proteins (data not shown, but see “Materials and Methods”). We then combined the column fractions containing 14-3-3ζ and chromatographed through an FPLC Superose 12 gel filtration column. Most of 14-3-3ζ eluted within fractions 40–46 with a size of ∼500-kDa (Fig.2B). Since the size of dimeric 14-3-3ζ is ∼60-kDa (21Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar, 22Van Hemert M.J. Yde Steensma H. van Heusden P.H. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 936-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), these data indicated that 14-3-3ζ is bound to another biological molecule within the brain microtubules. A silver-stained SDS gel of various column fractions from Fig. 2A showed numerous protein bands of various sizes within fractions 40–46 (data not shown) and did not give us any indication as to the identification of the 14-3-3ζ-bound protein (s). In a previous study, we found that 14-3-3ζ is associated with tau in bovine brain extract and binds to tau in vitro(36Hashiguchi M. Sobue K. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25247-25254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we showed that within brain microtubules, GSK3β and tau are parts of a multiprotein complex that elutes from an FPLC gel filtration column used in this study to generate Fig.2A with an ∼400–500-kDa size (20Sun W. Qureshi H.Y. Cafferty P.W. Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Neufield K.D. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11933-11940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We noted a very similar gel filtration behavior between the high molecular size 14-3-3ζ present within fractions 40–46 (Fig. 2A) and the tau phosphorylation complex described by us in a previous study (20Sun W. Qureshi H.Y. Cafferty P.W. Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Neufield K.D. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11933-11940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed various Fig. 2A column fractions for the presence of tau and GSK3β. As shown in Fig. 2, C"
https://openalex.org/W2106822021,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-Tat protein has been implicated in the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection. However, its role in modulating astroglial-neuronal relationships is poorly understood. Astrocyte infection with HIV has been associated with rapid progression of dementia. We thus initially transfected astrocytes with HIV proviral DNA and confirmed Tat production in these cells. Subsequently, using stably Tat-producing asytocyte cell lines, we observed that Tat promoted astrocyte survival by causing a prominent antioxidant effect and resistance to cell injury in these cells. Tat was released extracellularly where it could be taken up by other cells. Tat remained functionally active following uptake and caused long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation in lymphocytic and astrocytic cell lines. Tat released from astrocytes caused mitochondrial dysfunction, trimming of neurites, and cell death in neurons. Tat neurotoxicity was attenuated by anti-Tat antibodies, kynurenate or heparan sulfate. The neurotoxic effects of Tat were caused at concentrations lower than that needed to cause LTR transactivation. When Tat-expressing cells were injected into the rat dentate gyrus, Tat was taken up by granule cells and transported along neuronal pathways to the CA3 region where it caused glial cell activation and neurotoxicity. The arginine-rich domain of Tat was essential for both the LTR transactivation and the neurotoxic properties of Tat. Thus HIV-Tat is a potent neurotoxin that may act at distant sites while at the same time it assures its production by preventing cell death in astrocytes where it is produced.

The pathological features associated with HIVD include microglial cell activation, astrocytosis, decreased synaptic and dendritic density, and selective neuronal loss (1Masliah E. Ge N. Morey M. DeTeresa R. Terry R.D. Wiley C.A. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 285-291PubMed Google Scholar). Neuronal damage occurs through toxic substances released from infected microglia or macrophages and possibly astrocytes (2Nath A. Semin. Neurol. 1999; 19: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The virus predominantly infects microglia and macrophages where it causes a productive infection. Astrocytes are also frequently infected with HIV but produce limited viral replication (2Nath A. Semin. Neurol. 1999; 19: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The relevance of this viral infection remains unknown. Astrocytes maintain a barrier between blood and brain and provide neuronal support functions. Therefore, astrocytes may serve as a reservoir for the virus or induce neuronal damage by loss of neuronal support functions or release of cellular and viral products. Hence, infection of these cells could potentially have long term consequences on cerebral function. A striking feature is the presence of Tat transcripts in brains of HIV-infected individuals (3Wesselingh S.L. Power C. Glass J.D. Tyor W.R. McArthur J.C. Farber J.M. Griffin J.W. Griffin D.E. Ann.

It is produced in the early phase of infection and is actively released from infected lymphoid cells extracellularly (5Chang H.C. Samaniego F. Nair B.C. Buonaguro L. Ensoli B. AIDS. 1997; 11: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Extracellular Tat may be internalized by uninfected cells, or it may interact with the cell membrane initiating a cascade of events (6Ma M. Nath A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2495-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tat protein has both direct and indirect neurotoxic activity mediated by interaction with glutamate receptors, by disruption of cytokine network, and by reducing the neuroprotective effects of astrocytes (7Rappaport J.

Neurochem. 2001; 79: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), monocytes (13Foga I.O. Nath A. Hasinoff B.B. Geiger J.D. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1997; 16: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and T lymphocytes. In the latter, intracellular expression of Tat leads to down-regulation of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, thereby causing impaired mitochondrial membrane potential (14Westendorp M.O. Shatrov V.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. Frank R. Kraft M. Los M. Krammer P.H. Droge W. Lehmann V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 15Macho A. Calzado M.A. Jimenez-Reina L. Ceballos E. Leon J. Munoz E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7543-7551Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Oxidative damage is difficult to measure directly; however, oxidized endogenous macromolecules such as free protein carbonyl and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) can serve as indicators of oxidative damage (16Wilt S.G. Dugger N.V. Hitt N.D. Hoffman P.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 62: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation leads to the formation of HNE, a lipophilic alkenal that forms stable adducts on mitochondrial proteins (17Picklo M.J. Amarnath V. McIntyre J.O. Graham D.G. Montine T.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It has been suggested to be the key mediator of oxidative stress-induced cell death (18Liu W. Kato M. Akhand A.A. Hayakawa A. Suzuki H. Miyata T. Kurokawa K. Hotta Y. Ishikawa N. Nakashima I. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 635-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, in this study, we have determined the effect of Tat on mitochondrial function and other indicators of oxidative stress in astrocytes and neurons. Tat-86 from HIVHXB-2 was cloned from pGEX-Tat into pcDNA3 vector atBamHI/EcoRI driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. Further, Tat-86 and a deletion mutant of Tat-86 from which amino acids 48–56 were deleted by PCR (ΔTat), was cloned in-frame upstream of green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene driven by cytomegalovirus promoter in pEGFP-N1 (Clonetech) (Fig.1A). The HIV long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven GFP construct was made in pEGFP vector by deleting the cytomegalovirus promoter and inserting the LTR at SalI and SmaI. The PCR-cloned sequences were verified by double strand DNA sequencing. Tetracycline (tet) “on” system was used for generation of inducible constructs. Tat-86 was cloned downstream of a tet responsive element in pTREX vector (Clonetech). Reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtta) was first cloned in pEGFP vector (Clonetech) at BamHI/EcoRI and further subcloned in GFAP promoter-driven vector pGfaLac-1 atBamHI/BglII (Fig. 1B). Human fetal brain specimens were obtained from fetuses of 12–14 weeks gestational age. Neuronal cultures were prepared as described previously (19Magnuson D.S. Knudsen B.E. Geiger J.D. Brownstone R.M. Nath A. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were mechanically dissociated, suspended in Opti-MEM with 5% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.2% N2 supplement, and 1% antibiotic solution (penicillin G 104 units/ml, streptomycin 10 mg/ml, and amphotericin B 25 μg/ml). The dissociated cells were cultured for at least one month prior to use in experiments. Human fetal astrocytes, rat C6 glioma cells, SVGA (a human astrocytic subclone of the SVG cells) (20Major E.O. Miller A.E. Mourrain P. Traub R.G. de Widt E. Sever J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotic solution. C6 (rat glioma cell line), SVGA (human fetal astrocytes cell line), HeLa, or primary human astrocytes were transfected with endotoxin-free plasmids (Qiagen) using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) as per supplier's protocol. Cells were monitored for GFP fluorescence or stained for Tat using a monoclonal antibody (APR 352, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Herts, UK). For establishing stably transfected cell lines, 72 h post transfection, the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing G418 (Invitrogen) at 1.5 mg/ml. After 1 week, GFP florescent clones were picked under a florescent microscope using trypsin-soaked filter discs and sub-cultured for few weeks in G418 containing selection media. The cells were used within 30 passages and maintained in 500 μg/ml G418. We established SVGA-Tat, doxycycline-inducible SVGA-Tat (SVGA13), SVGA-LTR-CAT, SVGA-LTR-GFP, SVGA-pcDNA (SVGA-neo), C6-Tat, C6-Tat-GFP, C6-ΔTat-GFP, C6-pcDNA (C6-neo), and HeLa-Tat cell lines for the present study. Tat levels in culture supernatants were determined by a sandwich ELISA, where a Tat monoclonal antibody was coated at the bottom of the plate and Tat polyclonal antisera (raised in rabbit against HIV-1 Tat-72) was used as the secondary antibody (4Hudson L. Liu J. Nath A. Narayan O. Male D. Jones M. Everall I. J. Neurovirol. 2000; 6: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of detection was 50 pg/ml. Highly purified recombinant Tat protein produced in our laboratory was used as a standard (6Ma M. Nath A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2495-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In each case, total RNA was extracted from 3–4 × 106 cells by Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with RNase-free DNase. 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed as described previously (21Mori I. Diehl A.D. Chauhan A. Ljunggren H.G. Kristensson K. J. Neurovirol. 1999; 5: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) into cDNA using random hexamer primers and 200 units of superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 45 °C for 1 h and 70 °C for 10 min in 20 μl total volume. 50 ng of cDNA was used in PCR amplification with 25 pm of each primer, 0.1 mmdNTP mix, 1.25 units platinum Taq polymerase, and 1.2 mm Mg2+. The following primers were used: Tat, Tat-AC1 5′-ATGGAGCCAGTAGATCCTAG-3′ and Tat-AC2, 5′-TCATTGCTTTGATAGAGAAACTTG-3′; rTta, rTta1 and 5′-AATCGAAGGTTTAACCCG-3′; rTta2, 5′-TTGATCTTCCAATACGCAACC-3′; iNOS, iNOS1 5′-TGTGCCACCTCCAGTCCAGTGACA-3′ and iNOS2 5′-GCTCATCTCCCGTCAGTTGGTAGG-3′; FASL, FASL1 5′-TGGGGATGTTTCAGCTCTTC-3′ and FASL2 5′-TCATCATCTTCCCCTCCATC-3′; GAPDH, GAPDH1 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and GAPDH2 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. The amplified products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels with ethidium bromide and visualized by a UV transilluminator. Cells grown in 60 mm dishes 24–48 h post transfection were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature, and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. The cells were incubated at 4 °C for 18 h with either of the following antisera diluted in blocking buffer: monoclonal anti-Tat (1:1000), anti-microtubule-associated protein (MAP-2, a neuronal marker, 1:400; Chemicon), and anti-GFAP (astrocyte marker, 1:400; Sigma). The cells were washed 4 times in PBS followed by incubation with anti-mouse antisera labeled with Alexa 488 or 568 (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. After 4 washes in PBS, specimens were visualized by fluorescent confocal microscopy. HIV-1 LTR-CAT-based transactivation assays were performed using either HeLa-LTR-CAT or SVGA-LTR-CAT cells. A stable SVGA-LTR-CAT cell line was established using the LTR-CAT plasmid and selection with G418 for 3 weeks. The presence of LTR-CAT was confirmed following a transient transfection with pcDNA-Tat86. Alternatively, C6-Tat-GFP, C6-ΔTat-GFP, SVGA-Tat, and SVGA13 were transfected with LTR-CAT plasmid. CAT activity was monitored by quantitative ELISA. The supernatants from these cells were collected at 24, 48, and 96 h, which was then added to LTR-CAT or LTR-GFP cells by a complete media exchange. The supernatants were used fresh without undergoing any freeze thaw cycles. For detecting transcellular Tat activity, Tat-expressing cells were co-cultured with SVGA-LTR-GFP cells or a lymphocytic cell line D3R5 LTR-GFP (22Dorsky D.I. Harrington R.D. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 1999; 22: 213-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in equal ratios for 48–96 h in 1.5% fetal bovine serum containing medium with 50 μm chloroquine (to minimize the degradation of endocytosed Tat). In select experiments polyclonal Tat antisera at 1:200 final concentration was included for neutralization of Tat activity and observed by fluorescent microscopy. Total RNA was isolated at different time intervals using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) from the Tat- or pcDNA-transfected primary astrocytes. 6–7 μg RNA was labeled using reverse transcription step, and labeled cDNA was hybridized at 68 °C for 18 h with superarray nylon membranes for chemokine and apoptotic gene profile (Super Array). The signals were quantified by a phospho-imager. The signals were normalized to GAPDH, and ratios of test and control were expressed as fold increase or decrease. SVGA-Tat and SVGA-neo cells were treated with 10 μm 3-nitroproprionic acid (3NP) for varying amounts of time at 37 °C. Cells were collected in Locke's buffer and sonicated for 5 s. The level of protein oxidation was determined by an oxidized protein detection kit (OxyblotTM, ONCOR) (23Butterfield D.A. Lauderback C.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1050-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 20 min with 12% SDS and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in 10% trifluoroacetic acid, vortexing every 5 min, and then neutralized with OxyblotTM Neutralization solution. 600 ng of protein was blotted onto nitrocellulose paper by the slot blotting technique. Membranes were incubated with blocking buffer (PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% sodium azide, and 0.2% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature, exposed to rabbit anti-DNPH protein antibody (1:150) for 90 min, followed by anti-rabbit IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase (1:15,000) for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed after each step in PBS with 0.2% Tween 20 and developed with SigmaFastTM chromogen. Blots were analyzed by computer-assisted imaging software, Scion Imaging. Samples for HNE detection were similarly analyzed by slot blotting technique except that rabbit-anti-HNE antibody (Calbiochem; 1:4,000) was used as a primary antibody. Mitochondrial function was monitored by a fluorescent dye JC-1 to measure mitochondrial δ ψ as previously described (24Turchan J. Anderson C. Hauser K.F. Sun Q. Zhang J. Liu Y. Wise P.M. Kruman I. Maragos W. Mattson M.P. Booze R. Nath A. BMC Neurosci. 2001; 2: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). When loaded in the cells, JC-1 produces a green florescence at low membrane potential and red at high membrane potential. At the end of the experimental treatment, the cells were incubated with JC-1 (10 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min and then washed in Locke's solution. Fluorescence measurements were made with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 527 and 590 nm. The levels of fluorescence at both emission wavelengths were expressed as ratios of fluorescence measurements from which the percentage of the mean ratios compared with the untreated samples was calculated and analyzed using analysis of variance. Stable cell lines expressing Tat as SVGA-Tat, C6-Tat, C6-Tat-GFP, C6-ΔTat-GFP, SVGA13, and control cell lines SVGA-neo and C6-neo were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum. These cells were placed in the upper chambers of transwells and neurons in the bottom of the 6- or 24-well plate in medium containing 0.5–1.0% fetal bovine serum. Tet-inducible cells (SVGA13) were induced 1 day prior to and up to 6 days after co-culture with 1 mg/ml doxycycline. In select experiments heparan sulfate (1.3 μm), dextran sulfate (0.5 μm), or kynurenate (10 μm) were added to the bottom chamber of the transwell. Cell death was monitored by trypan blue exclusion assay as described previously (19Magnuson D.S. Knudsen B.E. Geiger J.D. Brownstone R.M. Nath A. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Five random fields were photographed and neuronal counts were determined by an investigator blinded to the experimental design. At least 200 cells were counted in each field. Each experiment was done in triplicate, and three independent experiments were conducted. The results are expressed as mean percentage of dead cells. C6Tat-GFP cells were sorted by a flow sorter. 7.5 × 104C6-Tat-GFP or C6-neo cells were unilaterally injected into the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus of 12-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats using the following stereotactic coordinates: 3.8 mm anterior and 1.5 mm lateral to Bregma, and 3.2 mm dorsal to the dural surface. Animals were monitored for 10 days post-surgery and then euthanized under deep anesthesia by perfusion with normal saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed, post-fixed for 16 h in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then cryopreserved in 30% sucrose for 72 h. 30 μm sections were prepared from the hippocampus. Sections at the needle tract and 300 μm posterior to the injection site were processed for Nissl stain (25Bruce-Keller A.J. Umberger G. McFall R. Mattson M.P. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Sections at the injection site were also immunostained for Tat using a monoclonal Tat antibody. To determine whether astrocytes can support the expression of Tat protein and to explore the subcellular localization of Tat, we transfected primary human astrocytes or SVGA cells with full-length HIV-1 infectious molecular DNA clone pNL4–3. Tat expression was demonstrated by immunostaining (Fig. 2A,a and b) and was further confirmed by LTR transactivation in pNL4–3-transfected SVGA-LTR-GFP cells (Fig.2A, d). No immunostaining for Tat or LTR transactivation was noted in pcDNA-transfected cells (Fig.2A, c and e). Pattern of Tat expression was also monitored in primary human fetal astrocytes transfected with Tat-GFP plasmid (Fig. 2B). The expression of Tat in astrocytes was confirmed by immunostaining for GFAP and Tat-GFP fluorescence (Fig. 2B, b). Tat expression occurred within 24 h of transfection. Tat was expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus with a strong signal in the nucleolus as revealed by green fluorescence (Fig. 2B, a, d, and e). The nuclei were counter-stained red with propidium iodide (c). Primary astrocytes transfected with ΔTat-GFP revealed ΔTat expression diffusely throughout the cell with no demarcation of nuclear boundary or no nucleolar pattern (Fig.2B, f and g). C6-Tat-GFP and C6-ΔTat-GFP clones were established by G418 selection and multiple subcloning by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The pattern of Tat and ΔTat expression in these stable cell lines was similar to that of transiently transfected astrocytes with the respective plasmids and did not change with prolonged culture. The expression of Tat in stable cell lines was further confirmed by detection of Tat mRNA by RT-PCR (Fig.3A) or LTR-CAT transactivation assay following transfection of these cells with the LTR-CAT plasmid (Fig. 3B). ΔTat-expressing cells showed basal level of transactivation activity (Fig. 3B). Clones of C6-Tat, SVGA-Tat, and SVGA13 cells that showed high CAT activity were used for further studies. To determine whether biologically active Tat can be released from Tat-expressing astrocytes and taken up by non-expressing cells, SVGA-Tat cells were overlaid with SVGA-LTR-GFP cells. GFP expression occurred in 48–96 h of co-culture (Fig.4A, a). No GFP expression was noted when these cells were co-cultures with SVGA-neo cells (Fig. 4A, b). Co-culture of C6-Tat or SVGA-Tat with D3R5-LTR-GFP cells also revealed GFP fluorescence (Fig.4A, c), whereas no effect was noted when co-cultured with SVGA-neo or C6-neo cells (Fig. 4A,d). SVGA cells when directly co-transfected with LTR-GFP and Tat plasmids revealed higher levels of LTR-based GFP expression within 24 h of transfection (Fig. 4A, e and f). Together, these observations demonstrate the LTR transactivation in both astrocytic and lymphocytic cells was specific for the Tat-expressing cells. To further confirm that the effect was due to release of Tat from the Tat-expressing cells and uptake by the LTR-containing cells we repeated the above experiments in the presence of Tat antisera. The cell to cell Tat-mediated LTR transactivation activity was partially inhibited by Tat antisera, which is strongly suggestive of release of Tat extracellularly. The inability of the antisera to block the LTR transactivation completely is most likely related to poor access to Tat by the antisera in areas of cell to cell contact. The transactivation signal was specific for Tat because no effect was noted with preimmune rabbit sera or by co-incubation of the LTR-GFP cells with SVGA-neo cells (Fig. 4B). Tat secretion in a 48-h post transfection period from 8 × 105 cells was estimated as 100 ng/ml by ELISA. However, culture supernatants containing Tat from the stable Tat-expressing cells collected at 24, 48, and 96 h post media change (Tat concentration less than 50 pg), did not reveal transactivation of LTR when incubated with the LTR-CAT or LTR-GFP cells, suggesting that small amounts of Tat secreted may not be sufficient for LTR transactivation. This is consistent with previous observations where the minimum Tat concentration required for LTR transactivation and HIV replication was determined to be > 100 ng/ml (26Ensoli B. Buonaguro L. Barillari G. Fiorelli V. Gendelman R. Morgan R. Wingfield P. Gallo R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 277-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Tat was stably expressed in astrocytes, we determined the effect of Tat expression on apoptotic genes as well as chemokine and cytokine gene expression profiles. Interestingly, primary astrocytes transfected with Tat plasmid for 24–36 showed that tumor necrosis factor-α and DAXX mRNAs were elevated 2–4-fold (Table I), whereas others were unchanged. Surprisingly, we did not see any effect on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 or macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, which was previously shown to increase in astrocytes after extracellular treatment with Tat protein (27Conant K. Garzino-Demo A. Nath A. McArthur J.C. Halliday W. Power C. Gallo R.C. Major E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3117-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Other mRNAs like, Caspase gene family, iNOS, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, Bcl gene family, and chemokine genes were unaffected. The results were also confirmed by RT-PCR (not shown). Further, tumor necrosis factor-α and MCP-1 were undetectable in the 48 h conditioned medium from C6-Tat and SVGA-Tat cells by quantitative ELISA. To rule out the under-expression of Tat, Tat expression was monitored in these cells by RT-PCR and immunostaining. Further cells expressing the Tat-GFP construct were used as a control. Nearly 95% of cells showed green fluorescence.Table ImRNA profile of Tat transfected primary human fetal astrocytesGeneFold Induction (21 hrs post-transfection)DAXX↑ 4.7TNF-α↑ 2.65TNF-α convertase↑ 2.5TRAF6↑ 2.9FASL↑ 2.6FAS↑ 2.7Caspase gene family, iNOS, TRAIL, Bcl gene family, and Chemokine genes were unaffected. Open table in a new tab Caspase gene family, iNOS, TRAIL, Bcl gene family, and Chemokine genes were unaffected. To further explore the possible effects of Tat on vulnerability of astrocytes to oxidative stress, we analyzed protein and lipid peroxidation products after challenging the cells with mitochondrial toxin 3NP. Oxidized endogenous products, protein carbonyl, and HNE were measured as markers of oxidative stress (16Wilt S.G. Dugger N.V. Hitt N.D. Hoffman P.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 62: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Tat-expressing astrocytic cells showed decreased oxidation products (HNE and protein carbonyl) when compared with the neo-cells (Fig. 5). These effects were specific for astrocytes as HeLa cells expressing Tat did not have a similar protective effect (Fig. 5). To determine the effect of Tat-expressing cells on neurons, stable Tat-producing or neo-C6 cells were co-cultured with primary neurons using transwells and analyzed at various time points. The mitochondrial δ ψ of neurons was unaffected within the first 48 h but after 72 h membrane potential decreased significantly in neurons co-cultured with C6-Tat cells as compared with C6-neo cells or C6-ΔTat cells (Fig. 6). These observations were confirmed by the use of doxycycline-regulated expression of Tat in SVGA cells (Fig. 6). Doxycycline takes ∼72 h for induction of Tat. Hence, in keeping with the above observation, we noted a significant decrease in mitochondrial δ ψ at about 7 days after adding doxycycline to the media. No significant toxicity was noted in similar cultures where doxycycline was not added or when doxycycline was added to the neuronal cultures similarly incubated with SVGA neo cells where the Tat gene was not present (Fig.6). These observations were further confirmed by collecting supernatants from stably Tat-producing cells after 48 h of culture and applying it to primary neurons for different times. The C6-Tat conditioned media decreased the neuronal mitochondrial membrane potential at 6 h post treatment (not shown). Previous studies (6Ma M. Nath A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2495-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Magnuson D.S. Knudsen B.E. Geiger J.D. Brownstone R.M. Nath A. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) have shown that Tat-induced neurotoxicity is mediated via excitatory amino acid receptors and Tat binds to heparan sulfate and dextran sulfate. Hence we incubated Tat-expressing astrocytes with neurons in transwells in the presence of each of these compounds. All these compounds attenuated the neurotoxicity measured as change in mitochondrial δ ψ. In control cultures where staurosporine (mitochondrial toxin) was incubated in the presence of heparan sulfate, no protective effect was noted (Fig.6), thus indicating that extracellular Tat is responsible for the neurotoxicity. To determine the effect of Tat-expressing astrocytes on neuronal survival, we exposed neuronal cultures to C6-Tat cells in transwells. Significant neuronal cell death occurred with C6-Tat cells (p < 0.05). However, C6-ΔTat cells did not produce significant neurotoxicity (Fig. 7), indicating that amino acids 48–56 are"

In particular, prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) is involved in labor and is the functional mediator of luteolysis to initiate a new estrous cycle in many species. These actions have been extensively studied in ruminants, but the enzymes involved are not clearly identified. Our objective was to identify which prostaglandin F synthase is involved and to study its regulation in the endometrium and in endometrial primary cell cultures. The expression of all previously known prostaglandin F synthases (PGFSs), two newly discovered PGFS-like genes, and a 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was studied by Northern blot and reverse transcription PCR. These analyses revealed that none of the known PGFS or the PGFS-like genes were significantly expressed in the endometrium. On the other hand, the 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase gene was strongly expressed in the endometrium at the time of luteolysis. The corresponding recombinant enzyme has aK m of 7 μm for PGH2 and a PGFS activity higher than the lung PGFS. This enzyme has two different activities with the ability to terminate the estrous cycle; it metabolizes progesterone and synthesizes PGF2α. Taken together, these data point to this newly identified enzyme as the functional endometrial PGFS. Prostaglandins are important regulators of reproductive function.

Prostaglandins are produced from arachidonic acid liberated from phospholipid stores through the action of phospholipases. Arachidonic acid is then converted into prostaglandin H2(PGH2),1 the common precursor of all prostaglandins, through the cyclooxygenase and peroxydase activities of prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS). There are two PGHS: PGHS1 and PGHS2. These enzymes (also known as Cox-1 and Cox-2), which have been identified some 10 years ago, are still extensively studied. Because PGH2 is the common precursor of all subtypes of prostaglandins and because these prostaglandin isotypes cause different and even opposing actions, the pathways leading to their individual formation need to be identified.Prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) is involved in several physiological processes including pressure regulation in the eye (1Crawford K. Kaufman P.L. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1987; 105: 1112-1116Google Scholar), vasoconstriction (2Cracowski J.L. Devillier P. Durand T. Stanke-Labesque F. Bessard G. J. Vasc. Res. 2001; 38: 93-103Google Scholar), and renal filtration (3Weber P.C. Contrib. Nephrol. 1980; 23: 83-92Google Scholar). It is associated with diseases such as diabetes (4Mezzetti A. Cipollone F. Cuccurullo F. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 475-488Google Scholar), osteoporosis (5Ma Y.F. Li X.J. Jee W.S.S. Mcosker J. Liang X.G. Setterberg R. Chow S.Y.

However, it is mostly known for its effect on the female reproductive system. In mice, gene knockout of the FP receptor (the receptor for PGF2α) leads to a failure in the initiation of labor (8Sugimoto Y. Yamasaki A. Segi E. Tsuboi K. Aze Y. Nishimura T. Oida H. Yoshida N. Tanaka T. Katsuyama M. Hasumoto K. Murata T. Hirata M. Ushikubi F. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Science. 1997; 277: 681-683Google Scholar). For most mammalian species, the production of PGF2α by the uterus is involved in the regulation of the ovarian cycle. This prostaglandin acts on the corpus luteum, initiating its regression (luteolysis) and leading to termination of the estrous cycle or of pregnancy (reviewed in Ref. 9McCracken J.A. Custer E.E. Lamsa J.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 263-323Google Scholar). The regulation of PGF2α production at the critical period of luteolysis or recognition of pregnancy has been studied extensively in ruminants. In cattle, PGF2α is mainly synthesized by epithelial cells of the endometrium (10Fortier M.A. Guilbault L.A. Grasso F. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1988; 83: 239-248Google Scholar). On days 17–20 of the bovine estrous cycle, oxytocin initiates the release of large pulsatile waves of PGF2α responsible for the regression of the corpus luteum and the subsequent decrease in progesterone. Despite their primary involvement in the regulation of fertility, the mechanisms involved in the production of PGF2α at the cellular and molecular levels are poorly documented.PGF2α can be produced from three distinct pathways (see Fig. 1). The most likely pathway to ensure selective production of PGF2α results from the reduction of PGH2 by a 9,11-endoperoxide reductase (now referred to as PGFS activity). Alternate pathways involve the reduction of PGD2 by a PGD2 11-ketoreductase or the reduction of PGE2by a 9-ketoprostaglandin reductase (9K-PGR). Previous results obtainedin vitro lead us to believe that the latter pathway could contribute to the production of PGF2α in cattle. In support of that hypothesis, we have identified a potential 9K-PGR in bovine endometrium (11Asselin E. Fortier M.A. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 125-131Google Scholar).Until now, a total of six PGFS have been identified. The first three were isolated in the cow: lung type prostaglandin F synthase (PGFS1) (12Watanabe K. Yoshida R. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7035-7041Google Scholar), lung type PGFS found in liver (PGFS2) (13Kuchinke W. Barski O. Watanabe K. Hayaishi O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 1238-1246Google Scholar), and liver type PGFS, also called dihydrodiol dehydrogenase 3 (DDBX) (14Suzuki T. Fujii Y. Miyano M. Chen L.Y. Takahashi T. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 241-248Google Scholar, 15Chen L.Y. Watanabe K. Hayaishi O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 17-26Google Scholar). The three other PGFS were respectively isolated from humans (16Suzuki-Yamamoto T. Nishizawa M. Fukui M. Okuda-Ashitaka E. Nakajima T. Ito S. Watanabe K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 335-340Google Scholar), sheep (17Wu W.X. Ma X.H. Yoshizato T. Shinozuka N. Nathanielsz P.W. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 2001; 8: 69-76Google Scholar), andTrypanosoma brucei (18Kubata B. Duszenko M. Kabututu Z. Rawer M. Szallies A. Fujimori K. Inui T. Nozaki T. Yamashita K. Horii T. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1327-1338Google Scholar). As a group, these enzymes belong to the aldoketoreductase family (19Jez J.M. Flynn T.G. Penning T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 639-664Google Scholar). The enzyme fromTrypanosoma belongs to the AKR5A subfamily, whereas the others belong to the AKR1C family, which is also primarily associated with hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. With the exception of theTrypanosoma enzyme, these enzymes also possess a PGD2 11-ketoreductase activity, thus giving them the ability to convert PGD2 into 9α,11β PGF2, an isomer of PGF2α (20Watanabe K. Iguchi Y. Iguchi S. Arai Y. Hayaishi O. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1583-1587Google Scholar). Bovine PGFS1 hasK m values of 120 μm for PGD2 and 10 μm for PGH2 (14Suzuki T. Fujii Y. Miyano M. Chen L.Y. Takahashi T. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 241-248Google Scholar). DDBX possesses K m values of 10 μm for PGD2 and 25 μm for PGH2 (14Suzuki T. Fujii Y. Miyano M. Chen L.Y. Takahashi T. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 241-248Google Scholar). The different bovine PGFS are closely related. The PGFS1 and PGFS2 enzymes are 99% identical, whereas DDBX is 86% identical to both PGFS1 and PGFS2.9-Ketoprostaglandin reductase activity has been detected in the reproductive system of several species. In the rabbit, a 9K-PGR that possesses 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity accounts for 30% of soluble protein in the ovaries (21Lacy W.R. Washenick K.J. Cook R.G. Dunbar B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 58-66Google Scholar, 22Wintergalen N. Thole H.H. Galla H.J. Schlegel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 264-270Google Scholar). It is also present at a lesser extent in the corpus luteum. 9K-PGR activity has also been observed in the ovine endometrium and corpus luteum (23Beaver C.J. Murdoch W.J. Prostaglandins. 1992; 44: 37-42Google Scholar) and in the bovine placenta (24Kankofer M. Wiercinski J. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1999; 61: 29-32Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified a potential 9K-PGR in bovine endometrium (11Asselin E. Fortier M.A. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 125-131Google Scholar). The partial sequence of this putative enzyme showed 92% homology with bovine lung type prostaglandin F synthase. For simplicity, we will refer to this enzyme as PGFSL1 for “prostaglandin F synthase-like 1.”Studies on the regulation of PGFS1 have already been performed on cultured bovine endometrial cells (11Asselin E. Fortier M.A. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 125-131Google Scholar, 25Xiao C.W. Liu J.M. Sirois J. Goff A.K. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2293-2299Google Scholar, 26Xiao C.W. Murphy B.D. Sirois J. Goff A.K. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 656-663Google Scholar). Treatments with hormones, oxytocin, and interferon τ had little influence on the level of PGFS1 mRNA expression (less than 50% variation), despite a large effect on prostaglandin production. At parturition in the sheep, the level of PGFS1 mRNA did not vary in endometrium, myometrium, or placenta (17Wu W.X. Ma X.H. Yoshizato T. Shinozuka N. Nathanielsz P.W. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 2001; 8: 69-76Google Scholar). Moreover, in all of these experiments, variations in the level of Cox-2 (prostaglandin H synthase 2) mRNA expression were observed. Thus, it was suggested that either Cox-2 alone was responsible for the increased production of PGF2α or that the PGFS responsible for the production of PGF2α in the endometrium was a different, yet unidentified enzyme.The objective of the present work was to identify the metabolic pathways and the enzymes involved in the formation of PGF2α in the endometrium. The measurement of mRNA levels in the bovine endometrium of the three known PGF2αsynthesizing enzymes (PGFS1, PGFS2, and DDBX) and three newly identified ones (PGFSL1, PGFSL2, and 20α-HSD) were done by Northern blotting and RT-PCR throughout the estrous cycle and in cultured endometrial cells. Recombinant proteins were produced and used to measure PGFS activity for each candidate enzyme.DISCUSSIONDespite the preeminent role of PGF2α in reproductive function in mammals, there has been no formal identification of the biosynthetic enzyme(s) responsible for its selective production. The bovine endometrium is the main source of PGF2α at the time of luteolysis. The results obtained in vitro in our laboratory suggested that PGF2α could be produced at least in part through conversion of PGD2 and/or PGE2. This possibility is supported by the ability of cultured epithelial cells to generate PGF2α, PGE2, and PGD2. HPLC analysis of prostaglandin metabolism (Fig. 2), however, showed no detectable 9-ketoreductase or 11-ketoreductase activity in control or oxytocin-treated epithelial cells. These two activities were not observed in stromal cells either (data not shown). Therefore, in these cells, PGF2αproduction appears to derive mainly by direct PGH2reduction (Fig. 1). This result was surprising because all PGFS are known to possess 11-ketoreductase activity. This was the first indication that in the bovine endometrium, PGF2α is produced by a PGFS activity distinct from what was observed in other tissues. Some may argue that the phenomenon observed in cell culture may vary from what occurs in vivo. This is unlikely, because the large increase in PGF2α production occurring in vivo in response to oxytocin at the time of luteolysis can be reproduced in vitro (32Asselin E. Drolet P. Fortier M.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4798-4805Google Scholar).As an alternate pathway to generate PGF2α, we were able to complete the previously published partial putative 9K-PGR sequence (PGFSL1) (11Asselin E. Fortier M.A. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 125-131Google Scholar). In the process, we were fortunate to findPGFSL2, another gene highly related to PGFS1. With DDBX and PGFS2, the AKR1C family now counts five members in the bovine species. This situation is similar to the humans where PGFS (AKR1C3) belongs to a group of four highly homologous enzymes of the same family (AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, and AKR1C4) (19Jez J.M. Flynn T.G. Penning T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 639-664Google Scholar). Because all the members of this family are highly homologous, the use of Northern blots and RT-PCR may be misleading, and results must be interpreted with caution.Some genes of the AKR1C family were expressed but only at the beginning of the cycle. No signal was visible at other periods of the cycle or in cultured cells. By RT-PCR we observed slightly different results.PGFS1, PGFS2, and PGFSL1 were no longer detectable at the beginning of the cycle, whereasDDBX expression was visible in cultured epithelial cells, and PGFSL2 was expressed all along the estrous cycle and in cultured cells. The detection of a positive signal forPGFSL2 can be explained by the greater sensitivity of RT-PCR analysis. We observed no signal for PGFS1, PGFS2, and PGFSL1 by PCR at the beginning of the cycle. These results, contrasting with Northern blot analysis, can be related to probe cross-hybridization. Indeed, the PGFS1 andPGFSL1 cDNA probes may have hybridized with theDDBX and/or PGFSL2 mRNA. This hypothesis is highly probable because they share long stretches of common nucleic acid sequences; PGFS1 and PGFSL2 have only one mismatch between position 490 and 587. The same is true forPGFSL1 and PGFSL2 between positions 824 and 916 and so on. It is likely that the PGFS cDNA probe bound to thePGFSL2 mRNA present on the membrane, even under the high stringency conditions used. Moreover, higher expression ofDDBX (and PGFSL2) at the beginning of the cycle may be related to the presence of leukocytes invading the endometrium at that moment. The endometrium, collected by scraping, is likely to contain some leukocytes that may express this gene at a high level.The present results appear to be in contradiction with those previously published. Xiao et al. (25Xiao C.W. Liu J.M. Sirois J. Goff A.K. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2293-2299Google Scholar, 26Xiao C.W. Murphy B.D. Sirois J. Goff A.K. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 656-663Google Scholar) observed variation of the PGFS1 messenger in cultured cells in response to oxytocin, interferon τ, and steroid treatments. These experiments were conducted by Northern blot analysis with 25 μg of total RNA (compared with 15 μg in the present study) under low stringency conditions (2× SSC at 55 °C). Under these conditions, the PGFS1 cDNA probe may have cross-hybridized with any of the five members of the AKR1C family. We have also detected PGFS1 by RT-PCR in cultured epithelial cells (11Asselin E. Fortier M.A. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 125-131Google Scholar). But the primers used then would have given a PCR product of the same size for PGFS2, PGFSL1, andPGFSL2. It is likely that in all of these experimentsPGFSL2 was detected instead of PGFS1.From these results, it is doubtful that the strong prostaglandin F synthase activity present in the bovine endometrium would come from the PGF synthases PGFS1, PGFS2, or DDBX. Indeed, if we take into account that stimulated epithelial cells can produce at least 1000 pg of PGF2α/μg of protein in 24 h and that the known PGFSs have a specific activity (with 40 μmPGH2) ranging from 3 to 56 nmol/mg of protein/min (21Lacy W.R. Washenick K.J. Cook R.G. Dunbar B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 58-66Google Scholar), they should represent at least 0.005–0.1% of total proteins. Because it is unlikely that PGH2 levels reach 40 μmin the cytosol, the actual enzyme levels would have to be even higher. Moreover, the absence of mRNA for the known PGFS and the lack of 11-ketoreductase activity in endometrial cells despite a large production of PGF2α eliminates these enzymes as functional PGFS in the bovine endometrium. Similarly, the low expression of PGFSL1 and PGFSL2 combined with the lack of PGFS activity of their recombinant proteins indicate that neither of these enzymes is involved in PGF2α formation in the endometrium. These enzymes may, however, be involved in steroid metabolism because it is the case for most enzymes of the AKR1C family.The absence of expression of the known PGFS lead us to search for an alternate enzyme as described under “Results.” We were fortunate that the AKR1B5 candidate qualified as the PGFS of the bovine endometrium. First, its mRNA was expressed in endometrial tissues and cells in relation with the ability of these sources to produce PGF2α. Second, the recombinant AKR1B5 protein did not display any 9-ketoprostaglandin reductase activity but a strong PGFS activity. The K m of AKR1B5 for PGH2 is half that of the recombinant lung type PGFS (14Suzuki T. Fujii Y. Miyano M. Chen L.Y. Takahashi T. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 241-248Google Scholar), and its specific activity is twice as high. The 20α-HSD activity of our recombinant protein was present as expected and was comparable with the purified native enzyme (35Warren J.C. Murdock G.L. Ma Y. Goodman S.R. Zimmer W.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1401-1406Google Scholar).Gene expression of AKR1B5 peaks around day 12, and at the same moment, progesterone reaches its highest systemic concentration, suggesting a link between the two. AKR1B5 may be directly or indirectly up-regulated by progesterone. Because AKR1B5 will also inactivate progesterone, at least locally, by transforming it into 20α-hydroxyprogesterone, it may down-regulate its own expression. Moreover, local metabolism of progesterone may have a physiological role in the endometrium. In ovarectomized sheep, progesterone withdrawal causes a build-up in oxytocin receptors (37Leavitt W.W. Okulicz W.C. McCracken J.A. Schramm W. Robidoux Jr, W.F. J. Steroid Biochem. 1985; 22: 687-691Google Scholar). In intact animals, it is thought that progesterone down-regulates its own receptor, therefore creating a situation similar to progesterone withdrawal (9McCracken J.A. Custer E.E. Lamsa J.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 263-323Google Scholar). However, Robinsonet al. (38Robinson R.S. Mann G.E. Lamming G.E. Wathes D.C. Reproduction. 2001; 122: 965-979Google Scholar) recently observed that the up-regulation of oxytocin receptors, occurring around days 15–16, in luminal epithelial cells was not dependent on a prior change in progesterone or estradiol α receptors. Additionally, Bogacki et al. (39Bogacki M. Silvia W.J. Rekawiecki R. Kotwica J. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 184-188Google Scholar) demonstrated that oxytocin was unable to bind to its own receptor in the presence of progesterone. This can constitute a major problem to initiate PGF2α production and luteolysis, because when the initial oxytocin bursts occurs, the organism is flooded with progesterone. It is possible that AKR1B5 reduces local progesterone concentration, allowing oxytocin to act on the endometrium.We propose the following model incorporating AKR1B5 in the estrous cycle. First, ovulation marks the beginning of estrous cycle and the corpus luteum grows to produce progesterone. Progesterone secretion peaks between days 12 and 18, and concomitantly AKR1B5 expression rises in the endometrium. At some point, there is enough AKR1B5 protein to locally shift the influx:degradation balance toward degradation of progesterone, hence decreasing the local progesterone concentration. Then the oxytocin receptor concentration increases. Around day 18, the first wave of oxytocin occurs, and interaction with its receptor is possible because the local concentration of progesterone has been reduced. This interaction leads to activation of phospholipases (40Lee J.S. Silvia W.J. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 141: 491-496Google Scholar,41Silvia W.J. Lee J.S. Trammell D.S. Hayes S.H. Lowberger L.L. Brockman J.A. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 141: 481-490Google Scholar) and subsequently to an increase in PGH2 concentration. PGH2 is then transformed by AKR1B5 into PGF2α. After several waves of PGF2α, the corpus luteum is destroyed, abolishing the production of progesterone. The reproductive system is then ready for a new cycle.The ability to combine two converging functions, inactivation of progesterone and generation of PGF2α, makes AKR1B5 a multifunctional enzyme with complementary action in the endometrium. Moreover, as an aldose reductase, this enzyme can also reduce benzaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, glucose, and several other carbonyl-containing compounds. This enzyme can be found in a wide variety of tissues. In humans a corresponding enzyme, AKR1B1, is involved in some complications associated with diabetes such as eye disease (cataracts) and nephropathy. It is believed that these complications are caused by sorbitol accumulation following reduction of glucose. Because PGF2α is also involved in these diseases, the possibility that AKR1B1 may act as a PGF synthase in those organs is worth investigating.In summary, we have found that AKR1C family members (to which all the currently known PGFS belong) are not expressed in the bovine endometrium. Instead, an aldose reductase known for its 20α-HSD activity, AKR1B5, is a likely candidate enzyme for controlling the sufficient and timely production of PGF2α in the bovine endometrium. This is the first time that a member of the AKR1B family has been associated with PGFS activity and also the first report of such an enzyme being expressed in the endometrium of any species. Prostaglandins are local mediators acting through paracrine or autocrine mechanisms. Prostaglandins are produced from arachidonic acid liberated from phospholipid stores through the action of phospholipases. Arachidonic acid is then converted into prostaglandin H2(PGH2),1 the common precursor of all prostaglandins, through the cyclooxygenase and peroxydase activities of prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS). There are two PGHS: PGHS1 and PGHS2. These enzymes (also known as Cox-1 and Cox-2), which have been identified some 10 years ago, are still extensively studied. Because PGH2 is the common precursor of all subtypes of prostaglandins and because these prostaglandin isotypes cause different and even opposing actions, the pathways leading to their individual formation need to be identified. Prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) is involved in several physiological processes including pressure regulation in the eye (1Crawford K. Kaufman P.L. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1987; 105: 1112-1116Google Scholar), vasoconstriction (2Cracowski J.L. Devillier P. Durand T. Stanke-Labesque F. Bessard G. J. Vasc. Res. 2001; 38: 93-103Google Scholar), and renal filtration (3Weber P.C. Contrib. Nephrol. 1980; 23: 83-92Google Scholar). It is associated with diseases such as diabetes (4Mezzetti A. Cipollone F. Cuccurullo F. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 475-488Google Scholar), osteoporosis (5Ma Y.F. Li X.J. Jee W.S.S. Mcosker J. Liang X.G. Setterberg R. Chow S.Y. Bone. 1995; 17: 549-554Google Scholar, 6Soper D.L. Milbank J.B. Mieling G.E. Dirr M.J. Kende A.S. Cooper R. Jee W.S. Yao W. Chen J.L. Bodman M. Lundy M.W. De B. Stella M.E. Ebetino F.H. Wang Y. deLong M.A. Wos J.A. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 4157-4169Google Scholar), and menstrual disorder (7Poyser N.L. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 53: 147-195Google Scholar). However, it is mostly known for its effect on the female reproductive system. In mice, gene knockout of the FP receptor (the receptor for PGF2α) leads to a failure in the initiation of labor (8Sugimoto Y. Yamasaki A. Segi E. Tsuboi K. Aze Y. Nishimura T. Oida H. Yoshida N. Tanaka T. Katsuyama M. Hasumoto K. Murata T. Hirata M. Ushikubi F. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Science. 1997; 277: 681-683Google Scholar). For most mammalian species, the production of PGF2α by the uterus is involved in the regulation of the ovarian cycle. This prostaglandin acts on the corpus luteum, initiating its regression (luteolysis) and leading to termination of the estrous cycle or of pregnancy (reviewed in Ref. 9McCracken J.A. Custer E.E. Lamsa J.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 263-323Google Scholar). The regulation of PGF2α production at the critical period of luteolysis or recognition of pregnancy has been studied extensively in ruminants. In cattle, PGF2α is mainly synthesized by epithelial cells of the endometrium (10Fortier M.A. Guilbault L.A. Grasso F. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1988; 83: 239-248Google Scholar). On days 17–20 of the bovine estrous cycle, oxytocin initiates the release of large pulsatile waves of PGF2α responsible for the regression of the corpus luteum and the subsequent decrease in progesterone. Despite their primary involvement in the regulation of fertility, the mechanisms involved in the production of PGF2α at the cellular and molecular levels are poorly documented. PGF2α can be produced from three distinct pathways (see Fig. 1). The most likely pathway to ensure selective production of PGF2α results from the reduction of PGH2 by a 9,11-endoperoxide reductase (now referred to as PGFS activity). Alternate pathways involve the reduction of PGD2 by a PGD2 11-ketoreductase or the reduction of PGE2by a 9-ketoprostaglandin reductase (9K-PGR). Previous results obtainedin vitro lead us to believe that the latter pathway could contribute to the production of PGF2α in cattle. In support of that hypothesis, we have identified a potential 9K-PGR in bovine endometrium (11Asselin E. Fortier M.A. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 125-131Google Scholar). Until now, a total of six PGFS have been identified. The first three were isolated in the cow: lung type prostaglandin F synthase (PGFS1) (12Watanabe K. Yoshida R. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

DDBX possesses K m values of 10 μm for PGD2 and 25 μm for PGH2 (14Suzuki T. Fujii Y. Miyano M. Chen L.Y. Takahashi T. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 241-248Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2011583811,"There is evidence that multi-site phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) by protein kinase C is important in both long- and short-term regulation of cardiac function. To determine the specific functional effects of these phosphorylation sites (Ser-43, Ser-45, and Thr-144), we measured tension and sliding speed of thin filaments in reconstituted preparations in which endogenous cTnI was replaced with cTnI phosphorylated by protein kinase C-ε or mutated to cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E, cTnI-S43E/S45E, or cTnI-T144E. We used detergent-skinned mouse cardiac fiber bundles to measure changes in Ca2+-dependence of force. Compared with controls, fibers reconstituted with phosphorylated cTnI, cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E, or cTnI-S43E/S45E were desensitized to Ca2+, and maximum tension was as much as 27% lower, whereas fibers reconstituted with cTnI-T144E showed no change. In the in vitro motility assay actin filaments regulated by troponin complexes containing phosphorylated cTnI or cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E showed both a decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity and maximum sliding speed compared with controls, whereas filaments regulated by cTnI-S43E/S45E showed only decreased maximum sliding speed and filaments regulated by cTnI-T144E demonstrated only desensitization to Ca2+. Our results demonstrate novel site specificity of effects of PKC phosphorylation on cTnI function and emphasize the complexity of modulation of the actin-myosin interaction by specific changes in the thin filament. There is evidence that multi-site phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) by protein kinase C is important in both long- and short-term regulation of cardiac function. To determine the specific functional effects of these phosphorylation sites (Ser-43, Ser-45, and Thr-144), we measured tension and sliding speed of thin filaments in reconstituted preparations in which endogenous cTnI was replaced with cTnI phosphorylated by protein kinase C-ε or mutated to cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E, cTnI-S43E/S45E, or cTnI-T144E. We used detergent-skinned mouse cardiac fiber bundles to measure changes in Ca2+-dependence of force. Compared with controls, fibers reconstituted with phosphorylated cTnI, cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E, or cTnI-S43E/S45E were desensitized to Ca2+, and maximum tension was as much as 27% lower, whereas fibers reconstituted with cTnI-T144E showed no change. In the in vitro motility assay actin filaments regulated by troponin complexes containing phosphorylated cTnI or cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E showed both a decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity and maximum sliding speed compared with controls, whereas filaments regulated by cTnI-S43E/S45E showed only decreased maximum sliding speed and filaments regulated by cTnI-T144E demonstrated only desensitization to Ca2+.

Single point mutations linked to familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathies involve charged amino acids on a number of thin filament proteins that induce alterations in myofilament regulation by Ca2+, as well as alterations in modulation of Ca2+ regulation by pH and sarcomere length (1Chandra M.

Bell M. Housmans P.R. Weissman N.J. Morad M. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10039-10048Google Scholar). Moreover, these charge modifications of the thin filament are well correlated with altered myocardial dynamics that may be significant in the evolution of hypertrophy and sudden death (3de Tombe P.P. Solaro R.J. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 2000; 28: 991-1001Google Scholar). An important question is whether charge changes introduced into the thin filament proteins by protein phosphorylation may also be causal in cardiac dysfunction (4Solaro R.J. Burkart E.M. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2002; 34: 689-693Google Scholar). In experiments reported here we introduced charge changes into specific protein kinase C (PKC)1 sites of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) by either protein phosphorylation or mutation of these sites to glutamic acid. We tested the effect of these changes on Ca2+ regulation of steady-state tension generated by the myofilaments as well as the speed of thin filament sliding on myosin heads in the in vitro motility assay. cTnI is a key regulatory and inhibitory protein of the thin filament, which together with the tropomyosin binding unit of troponin (Tn), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), the Ca2+ binding unit, cardiac troponin C (cTnC), and tropomyosin (Tm) confers Ca2+sensitivity to the actin-myosin reaction. The phosphorylation of cTnI at specific sites (Ser-23 and Ser-24) that are substrates for protein kinase A and specific sites (Ser-43, Ser-45, and Thr-144) that are substrates for PKC appears to be of special significance with regard to modulation of myofilament function and control of cardiac dynamics (5Chandra M. Dong W.J. Pan B.S. Cheung H.C. Solaro R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13305-13311Google Scholar, 6Kentish J.C. McCloskey D.T. Layland J. Palmer S. Leiden J.M. Martin A.F. Solaro R.J. Circ.

Our hypothesis has been that covalent modification of cTnI not only plays a role in the homeostasis of cardiac function, but also in the decline of cardiac function that occurs in the transition from compensated hypertrophy to heart failure. Ample evidence indicates that phosphorylation of cTnI at Ser-23 and Ser-24 results in a reduction in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (9Kranias E.G. Solaro R.J. Nature. 1982; 298: 182-184Google Scholar) and an increase in cross-bridge cycling (6Kentish J.C. McCloskey D.T. Layland J. Palmer S. Leiden J.M. Martin A.F. Solaro R.J. Circ.

These effects of protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of cTnI are important elements in the enhanced relaxation that is critical to the response of the heart to adrenergic stimulation (6Kentish J.C.

Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30773-30780Google Scholar). The role of the PKC sites on cTnI in the regulation of myofilament response to Ca2+ and regulation of cross-bridge cycling is less clear. An understanding of the role of these sites is particularly important in view of evidence from studies on failing human hearts (14Bowling N. Walsh R.A. Song G. Estridge T. Sandusky G.E. Fouts R.L. Mintze K. Pickard T. Roden R. Bristow M.R. Sabbah H.N. Mizrahi J.L. Gromo G. King G.L. Vlahos C.J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 384-391Google Scholar, 15Bowman J.C. Steinberg S.F. Jiang T. Geenen D.L. Fishman G.I. Buttrick P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2189-2195Google Scholar) and on hearts from transgenic mouse models (16Huang L. Wolska B.M. Montgomery D.E. Burkart E.M. Buttrick P.M. Solaro R.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1114-C1120Google Scholar, 17Montgomery D.E. Wolska B.M. Pyle W.G. Roman B.B. Dowell J.C. Buttrick P.M. Koretsky A.P. Del Nido P. Solaro R.J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 282: H2397-H2405Google Scholar). These studies indicate that increased activity and expression of PKC may lead to excessive and/or persistent phosphorylation of cTnI by PKC with an associated depression in tension-generating capability. Myofilaments from hearts of transgenic mice expressing the mutant cTnI-S43A/S45A (substitution of alanine residues, A, for serine residues, S) demonstrate a blunting of the effect of PKC-mediated phosphorylation to depress maximum tension (17Montgomery D.E. Wolska B.M. Pyle W.G. Roman B.B. Dowell J.C. Buttrick P.M. Koretsky A.P. Del Nido P. Solaro R.J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 282: H2397-H2405Google Scholar). Moreover, these transgenic mouse hearts contract and relax much faster than the controls and demonstrate significant alterations in the Ca2+-pressure relationship of isolated, perfused hearts (18MacGowan G.A. Du C. Cowan D.B. Stamm C. McGowan F.X. Solaro R.J. Koretsky A.P. Del Nido P.J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 280: H835-H843Google Scholar). Exactly how phosphorylation of the PKC sites on cTnI affects cross-bridge function in the myofilament lattice remains unknown. Studies with transgenic hearts are revealing but difficult to interpret. Apart from the existence of multiple sites for PKC-mediated phosphorylation, substitution of alanine for serine in the transgenesis is not benign. This substitution itself causes a depression in both maximum tension and maximum Ca2+-stimulated actomyosin MgATPase activity in fully reconstituted preparations (7Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Solaro R.J. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25445-25454Google Scholar). In addition, modification of the PKC sites on cTnI influences the ability of PKC to phosphorylate cTnT (19Pyle W.G. Sumandea M.P. Solaro R.J. de Tombe P.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1215-H1224Google Scholar). The reverse is true as well (17Montgomery D.E. Wolska B.M. Pyle W.G. Roman B.B. Dowell J.C. Buttrick P.M. Koretsky A.P. Del Nido P. Solaro R.J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 282: H2397-H2405Google Scholar). We report here new evidence on the role of the specific PKC sites of cTnI in regulation of the actin-myosin interaction. We phosphorylated cTnI directly by PKC-ε (TnI-P), one of the predominant isoforms of PKC found in the adult cardiac myocyte (20Bogoyevitch M.A. Parker P.J. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 757-767Google Scholar), and incorporated either the unphosphorylated or the phosphorylated cTnI into thin filaments. To determine the specific role of the phosphorylation induced change in charge, we also generated the following mutant forms of cTnI: cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E, cTnI-S43E/S45E, and cTnI-T144E in which serine (S) and/or threonine (T) residues were replaced by glutamic acid (E). Our experiments provide direct evidence that charge change at PKC sites of phosphorylation inhibits the actin-myosin interaction by causing decreases in maximum tension, Ca2+ sensitivity, and thin filament sliding speed. Our data also indicate that phosphorylation of one region of cTnI may be more significant in regulating tension than filament sliding speed. Expression and purification of recombinant human cTnC, mouse cTnI (wild-type (WT) and mutant), and mouse cTnT was previously described (21Guo X. Wattanapermpool J. Palmiter K.A. Murphy A.M. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15210-15216Google Scholar). The preparation of actin, myosin, heavy meromyosin, and rhodamine phalloidin-labeled actin for use in the motility assay was previously described by Homsheret al. (22Homsher E. Kim B. Bobkova A. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1881-1892Google Scholar). Bovine ventricular tropomyosin was prepared according to the method described by Tobacman and Adelstein (23Tobacman L.S. Adelstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 798-802Google Scholar). Troponin reconstitution for in vitro motility studies was accomplished by mixing cTnI, cTnC, and cTnT in final concentrations of 10 μm each, in the presence of 6 m urea. The mixture was sequentially dialyzed at 4 °C, each time for at least 12 h, against 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mmDTT, 0.01% NaN3, 50 μm CaCl2, and 1) 1 m KCl, 2 m urea; 2) 1 mKCl; 3) 0.1 m KCl; 4) 0 m KCl. After the last dialysis, proteins were centrifuged and purified using fast protein liquid chromatography. Purified whole Tn was collected and a mixture of protease inhibitors (5 mg/ml each of TPCK, TLCK, and 0.3 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added before proteins were separated into aliquots and stored at −80 °C for up to 6 months. Recombinant PKC-ε was prepared in our laboratory using a recombinant baculovirus system as previously described (24Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of cTnI forin vitro motility assay studies was accomplished by first forming a 10 μm cTnI-cTnC complex in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 m KCl, 10 mm DTT, and 0.2m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. This complex was then phosphorylated in the presence of 0.4 mm[γ-35S]ATP (Sigma), 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), 0.3 mm phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar-Lipids), and 0.2 mm diacylglycerol (Avanti Polar-Lipids) in a reaction initiated by ∼0.5 μm PKC-ε for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 6 m urea to the solution. cTnT (10 μm) was then added to the mixture to reconstitute the whole Tn complex. The mixture was sequentially dialyzed at 4 °C, each time for at least 12 h, against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT and 1) 1 m KCl, 2) 0.7 mKCl, and 3) 0.3 m KCl, before purification by fast phase liquid chromatography. Purified whole Tn was collected, and a mixture of protease inhibitors was added. The protein kinase A sites present in cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E were not phosphorylated by PKC-ε under our conditions. Phosphorylation of cTnI for skinned fiber studies was similar, except cTnI was not complexed to cTnC for phosphorylation. The phosphorylation reaction was stopped by adding 6 m urea to the solution. cTnT (10 μm) was then added to the mixture to form a cTnT-cTnI complex used for the extraction procedure in skinned fiber studies. The mixture was dialyzed overnight against extraction buffer containing 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.5), 250 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm DTT at 4 °C. The next day, insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 30 min. After centrifugation, protease inhibitors were added to the supernatant fraction containing the cTnT-cTnI complex. Left ventricular papillary muscle fiber bundles were dissected from male CD-1 mice (age 3 months) and detergent-skinned overnight as previously described (25Chandra M. Kim J.J. Solaro R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 219-223Google Scholar). The detergent-skinned fiber bundle was mounted between a force transducer and a micro-manipulator, and the sarcomere length was adjusted to 2.3 μm. Initial maximum isometric force was measured in activating solution (pCa 4.5) containing 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 33.8 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 9.96 mmCaCl2, 5.39 mm ATP, 6.47 mmMgCl2, 12 mm creatine phosphate, 10 IU/ml creatine kinase, and 1 mm DTT. The fiber bundle was then placed in high relaxing solution containing 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 53.5 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 0.025 mm CaCl2, 1 mm free Mg2+, 5 mm MgATP2−, 12 mm creatine phosphate, and protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Force was measured while the fibers were bathed in sequentially increasing Ca2+ concentrations ranging from pCa 8 to 4.5. pCa values were calculated as previously described using binding constants reported by Godt and Lindley (26Godt R.E. Lindley B.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 80: 279-297Google Scholar). The Tn exchange was carried out by treating the fiber for 90 min with 2 ml of extraction solution containing cTnT-cTnI, prepared as previously described (25Chandra M. Kim J.J. Solaro R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 219-223Google Scholar), then 10 min with 2 ml of extraction buffer (without cTnT-cTnI) and 10 min with 2 ml of high relaxing. Maximum Ca2+-activated force was then measured inpCa 4.5 solution to determine the extent of endogenous troponin removed. Next, the cTnT-cTnI-treated fiber was treated for 90 min with a TnC reconstitution solution, prepared as previously described (25Chandra M. Kim J.J. Solaro R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 219-223Google Scholar), followed by measurement of maximum Ca2+-activated force in pCa 4.5 solution and subsequent force measurements ranging from pCa 8 topCa 4.5. Rhodamine phalloidin-labeled actin movement over heavy meromyosin-covered nitrocellulose surfaces was monitored in motility chambers by video epifluorescence microscopy and analyzed as previously described (22Homsher E. Kim B. Bobkova A. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1881-1892Google Scholar). Forty μl of 270–300 μg/ml heavy meromyosin was injected into the motility chamber and allowed to incubate for 2 min. This was followed by 40 μl of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma), which incubated for 1 min. The slide chamber was then washed with two 40 μl aliquots of low salt assay (AB) buffer (20 mm KCl, 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 0.5 mmEGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). Next, 40 μl of rhodamine phalloidin-labeled actin was injected into the motility chamber and incubated for 1 min in the chamber. Again, the slide chamber was washed with two 40-μl aliquots of AB buffer. This was followed by injection of 40 μl of a 50-mm ionic strength reconstitution solution containing regulatory proteins (Tn and Tm, ranging in concentrations from 0.1–0.4 μm). The reconstitution solution consisted of 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA (with varying ratios of CaKEGTA to K2EGTA), and 10 mm DTT. The chamber was incubated in this solution for 5 min, and the solution replaced by two 40-μl washes of motility solution, which was a reconstitution solution to which 1 mm Na2-ATP and a glucose/oxidase/catalase mixture had been added to slow photobleaching (3 mg/ml glucose, 100 μg/ml glucose oxidase, 10 μg/ml catalase). Cardiac myofilament proteins from skinned fiber bundles were analyzed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as well as 8% alkaline urea polyacrylamide gels as previously described (25Chandra M. Kim J.J. Solaro R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 219-223Google Scholar). The exchange of endogenous Tn with recombinant Tn components was demonstrated by Western blot analysis using a primary anti-cTnT antibody (Sigma) and secondary goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish-peroxidase (Sigma). Data from the pCa-force measurements in skinned fibers were normalized and fitted to the Hill equation by using a nonlinear least-square regression procedure to obtain the pCa50 (−log of free Ca2+-concentration required for half-maximal activation) and the Hill coefficient (n). Statistical differences were analyzed by an unpaired t test and ANOVA with the criteria for significance set at p < 0.05. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. The in vitro motility assay data were acquired and analyzed as previously described in detail (22Homsher E. Kim B. Bobkova A. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1881-1892Google Scholar). Typically the speed at a given pCa is reported as a mean for ∼150–300 filaments. Data are reported as means ± S.E. Plots of the mean filament sliding speed versus pCa were fitted to the Hill equation. Fits to the Hill equation were made from a regression using all of the observed speeds so that a fit was generated from over 1200 filaments. Our strategy to analyze the functional role of charge modification at the PKC sites on cTnI involved exchange of native Tn components in detergent extracted (skinned) fiber bundles with Tn containing phosphorylated or mutant forms of cTnI. We used a procedure illustrated in a chart recording depicted in Fig. 1 A, in which the tension of the skinned fiber bundle was first measured over a range of pCa values. The fiber bundle was then exposed to a large excess of cTnT-cTnI under conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The advantage of this approach, which was developed in our lab by Chandra et al. (25Chandra M. Kim J.J. Solaro R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 219-223Google Scholar), over the use of cTnT alone (27Hatakenaka M. Ohtsuki I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1022-1027Google Scholar), is that the fiber bundle is more relaxed during the exchange. The recording in Fig. 1 A shows that after the incubation in cTnT-cTnI solution, tension generated by the fiber bundle at pCa 4.5 was a very small fraction of the control value (varied from 3–30% depending on cTnI mutant used). The ratio of this tension to the control maximum tension serves as an index of the extent of replacement of Tn with cTnT-cTnI and the associated removal of cTnC. Fig. 1 B shows Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE analysis of myofilament proteins from skinned fiber bundles with endogenous Tn complex (lane 1), after removal of endogenous Tn complex by extraction with cTnT-cTnI complex (lane 2), and after subsequent reconstitution of Tn complex with cTnC treatment (lane 3). A pure cTnC standard is shown in lane 4. The exogenous, recombinant mouse cTnT was modified with a myc tag, which slowed its mobility so it runs closer with actin. In lanes 2and 3, the band for actin appears larger, due to the presence of recombinant cTnT running closer to actin. The myc tag has no effect on cTnT function but served to alter the mobility of cTnT, permitting demonstration of exchange of Tn. Also, the band for cTnC is usually hard to detect in SDS gels, as it runs closely with myosin light chain-2 and does not normally stain well with Coomassie blue. However, in lane 3 of Fig. 1 B, the band for myosin light chain-2 appears darker, probably due to the presence of recombinant cTnC due to incubation of the skinned fiber with the cTnC reconstitution, which has a high concentration of cTnC (4 mg/ml). Fig.1 C shows Western blot analysis of cTnT from skinned fiber bundles with endogenous Tn complex (lane 1), after removal of endogenous Tn complex by extraction with cTnT-cTnI complex (lane 2), and after subsequent reconstitution of Tn complex with cTnC treatment (lane 3). The endogenous cTnT shown inlane 1 demonstrates a faster mobility, compared with recombinant cTnT shown in lanes 2and 3, and this band essentially disappears after extraction and reconstitution (lane 3), indicating exchange of Tn occurred. A pure cTnT standard is shown in lane 4. Further evidence of Tn exchange is illustrated in Fig. 1 D, which visualizes the cTnC band more clearly by non-SDS alkaline urea PAGE analysis. The presence of cTnC in the untreated skinned fiber bundles (i.e. still containing endogenous Tn complex) is shown in lane 1.Subsequent removal of the endogenous Tn complex by extraction with cTnT-cTnI complex results in loss of cTnC from the fiber bundle (lane 2), which accounts for the decrease in tension generated by the fiber bundle at pCa 4.5 (Fig.1 A). After reconstitution of Tn complex with cTnC treatment the cTnC band reappears (lane 3). This incubation of the fiber bundle in cTnC solution restored maximum tension to a value close (∼75%) to that of the control, and was maintained during a series of measurements over a range of pCa values. A pure cTnC standard is shown in lane 4. The pCa-tension curves obtained after the exposure of the fiber bundle to the same series of solutions, which did not contain cTnT-cTnI or cTnC, were essentially the same as those obtained after replacement of the endogenous Tn with exogenous native Tn (data not shown). This result indicated that the fall-off of maximum tension was time-dependent and that the exchange protocol using native Tn components did not result in changes in the myofilament activity due to nonspecific interactions of the cTnT-cTnI complex to other regions of the thin filament. The pCa-tension relation of fiber bundles incubated with exchange solutions without proteins (cTnT-cTnI or cTnC) gave pCa50 values of 5.70 ± 0.01, whereas fiber bundles incubated with exchange solutions containing native Tn components gave pCa50 values of 5.72 ± 0.01. Fig. 2 compares pCa-tension relations for fiber bundles in which the endogenous cTnI was exchanged with various forms of exogenous cTnI. Data in Fig. 2 A show that compared with controls, exchanged with unphosphorylated WT cTnI, which had a pCa50 = 5.55 ± 0.01, fiber bundles containing cTnI exhaustively phosphorylated by PKC-ε (cTnI-P) had a reduced sensitivity to Ca2+(pCa50 = 5.38 ± 0.01). As summarized in Fig. 3 B and Table I, there was also a significant 26% decrease in maximum tension of the myofilaments induced by cTnI phosphorylation at the PKC sites. Replacement of endogenous Tn with Tn complex containing cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E, in which charged glutamic acid residues replaced the two serines and one threonine that are substrates for PKC (Fig. 2 B), resulted in a desensitization of the myofilaments to Ca2+ with a decrease in thepCa50 to 5.31 ± 0.01 and a 26% depression in maximum tension (Fig. 3 B and Table I). Thus, the presence of cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E in place of WT cTnI decreased thepCa50 by 0.24 units and decreased Ca2+ sensitivity to a slightly greater extent than that of cTnI-P, which gave a decrease in the pCa50 of 0.17 pCa units. When unphosphorylated cTnI was replaced with cTnI-S43E/S45E (Fig. 2 C), the pCa50decreased by 0.21 units and tension decreased by 27% (Fig.3 B and Table I). Replacement of cTnI with cTnI-S43D/S45D (serine residues replaced by aspartic acid residues), however, induced only a relatively small change in myofilament Ca2+sensitivity (a decrease in the pCa50 of 0.11 units) and a 20% decrease in maximum tension (data not shown) compared with the effects of replacement of cTnI with cTnI-S43E/S45E. Lastly, when unphosphorylated cTnI was replaced with cTnI-T144E (Fig.2 D), there was neither a decrease in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity nor a decrease in maximum tension (Fig.3 B and Table I).Figure 3Summary of skinned fibers results. A, summary of pCa50 values obtained in skinned fibers after removal of endogenous Tn complex and substitution with Tn containing cTnI WT, cTnI-P, cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E cTnI-S43E/S45E, or cTnI-T144E. The decrease inpCa50 was significantly lower in skinned fibers containing cTnI-P, cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E, or cTnI-S43E/S45E (p < 0.05).

Maximum Ca2+-dependent tension was determined after the fibers were bathed in a solution of pCa 4.5 and normalized to the maximum tension determined in fibers reconstituted with cTnI WT. The decrease in maximum tension was significantly lower in skinned fibers containing cTnI-P, cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E, or cTnI-S43E/S45E (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table ISummary of results from skinned fibers and in vitro motility assay studiescTnI MutantTensionSliding SpeedpCa50Maximum forcepCa50V max%μm/sTnI WT5.55 ± 0.01100 ± 2.76.97 ± 0.26.13 ± 0.4TnI-P5.38 ± 0.0174.0 ± 2.55.64 ± 0.13.49 ± 0.2TnI WT5.55 ± 0.01100 ± 2.76.42 ± 0.14.86 ± 0.2TnI-S43E/S45E/T144E5.31 ± 0.0173.9 ± 2.95.72 ± 0.12.16 ± 0.2TnI WT5.55 ± 0.01100 ± 2.77.11 ± 0.25.30 ± 0.4TnI-S43E/S45E5.34 ± 0.0172.5 ± 2.57.13 ± 0.24.46 ± 0.3TnI WT5.55 ± 0.01100 ± 2.76.17 ± 0.15.61 ± 0.3TnI-T144E5.55 ± 0.02105.5 ± 4.75.66 ± 0.15.35 ± 0.1For the columns under “Tension,” changes in Ca2+sensitivity (pCa50) and tension development (% maximum force normalized to TnI WT) for skinned fibers containing the various forms of cTnI.

Since PMTs are evolutionarily conserved in fungi but are absent in green plants, the PMT family is a putative target for new antifungal drugs, particularly in fighting the threat of phytopathogenic fungi. The PMT family is phylogenetically classified into PMT1, PMT2, and PMT4 subfamilies, which differ in protein substrate specificity. In the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as in many other fungi the PMT family is highly redundant, and only the simultaneous deletion of PMT1/PMT2 and PMT4 subfamily members is lethal. In this study we analyzed the molecular organization of PMT family members in S. cerevisiae. We show that members of the PMT1 subfamily (Pmt1p and Pmt5p) interact in pairs with members of the PMT2 subfamily (Pmt2p and Pmt3p) and that Pmt1p-Pmt2p and Pmt5p-Pmt3p complexes represent the predominant forms. Under certain physiological conditions, however, Pmt1p interacts also with Pmt3p, and Pmt5p with Pmt2p, suggesting a compensatory cooperation that guarantees the maintenance ofO-mannosylation. Unlike the PMT1/PMT2 subfamily members, the single member of the PMT4 subfamily (Pmt4p) acts as a homomeric complex. Using mutational analyses we demonstrate that the same conserved protein domains underlie both heteromeric and homomeric interactions, and we identify an invariant arginine residue of transmembrane domain two as essential for the formation and/or stability of PMT complexes in general. Our data suggest that protein-protein interactions between the PMT family members offer a point of attack to shut down overall proteinO-mannosylation in fungi.

In yeasts and fungi, the attachment of O-linked mannosyl residues to proteins of the secretory pathway is essential for cell viability (1Gentzsch M. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5752-5759Google Scholar). In particular it is indispensable for cell wall integrity and normal cellular morphogenesis (2Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 297-307Google Scholar, 3Timpel C. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Ziegelbauer K. Ernst J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20837-20846Google Scholar, 4Timpel C. Zink S. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Schroppel K. Ernst J.F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3063-3071Google Scholar). Impairment ofO-mannosylation also affects the stability, localization, and/or proper function of individual proteins (5Bourdineaud J.P. van der Vaart J.M. Donzeau M. de Sampaio G. Verrips C.T. Lauquin G.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 85-98Google Scholar, 6Buurman E.T. Westwater C. Hube B. Brown A.J. Odds F.C. Gow N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2001; 21: 271-280Google Scholar). Furthermore, aberrant O-mannosylation can interfere with the retrograde transport of misfolded proteins across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 (11Harty C. Strahl S. Romisch K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1093-1101Google Scholar).O-mannosylation is not only important in yeast, but also in mammals. It was recently shown that in humans, O-mannosyl glycosylation represents a new pathomechanism for muscular dystrophy and neuronal migration disorders (12Yoshida A. Kobayashi K. Manya H. Taniguchi K. Kano H. Mizuno M. Inazu T. Mitsuhashi H. Takahashi S. Takeuchi M. Herrmann R. Straub V. Talim B. Voit T. Topaloglu H. Toda T. Endo T. Dev.

Lehesjoki A.E. Cruces J. Voit T. Walsh C.A. Van Bokhoven H. Brunner H.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 1033-1043Google Scholar). In yeast and fungi, O-mannosylation is initiated in the lumen of the ER by an essential family of proteinO-mannosyltransferases (PMTs). These enzymes catalyze the transfer of mannose from dolichyl phosphate-activated mannose (Dol-P-Man) to serine or threonine residues of secretory proteins (2Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 297-307Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a total of seven PMT family members (Pmt1–7p) have been identified, which share almost identical hydropathy profiles that predict the PMTs to be integral membrane proteins with multiple transmembrane domains. Pmt1–6 proteins feature an overall protein sequence identity of 57.57. Pmt7p is less conserved. ProteinO-mannosyltransferase activity has been demonstrated for Pmt1–4p and Pmt6p (14Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 481-486Google Scholar). Aside from S. cerevisiae PMTs, orthologues are known from many other yeast and fungi, for example,Candida albicans (CaPMT1–2 andCaPMT4–6) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe(SpPMT1, SpPMT3, and SpPMT4) (Refs. 3Timpel C. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Ziegelbauer K. Ernst J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20837-20846Google Scholarand 4Timpel C. Zink S. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Schroppel K. Ernst J.F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3063-3071Google Scholar). 2T. Willer and S. Strahl, unpublished data.2T. Willer and S. Strahl, unpublished data. Moreover, PMT homologues have been also identified in many multicellular eukaryotes such as Drosophila melanogaster, mouse and, humans (15Martı́n-Blanco E. Garcı́a-Bellido A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6048-6052Google Scholar, 16Jurado L.A. Coloma A. Cruces J. Genomics. 1999; 58: 171-180Google Scholar, 17Willer T. Amselgruber W. Deutzmann R. Strahl S. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 771-783Google Scholar). Despite their evolutionarily conservation in fungi and throughout the animal kingdom (with the exception of Caenorhabditis elegans), PMTs are not present in green plants.2 This makes the PMT family in fungi especially attractive as a target for the development of new antifungal drugs in order to combat phytopathogenic fungi. The protein O-mannosyltransferases can be divided into three subfamilies: PMT1, PMT2, and PMT4, which include transferases closely related to S. cerevisiae Pmt1p, Pmt2p, and Pmt4p, respectively (17Willer T. Amselgruber W. Deutzmann R. Strahl S. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 771-783Google Scholar, 18Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Google Scholar). Members of the PMT1 and PMT2 subfamilies show marked similarities and distinctions from PMT4 subfamily members. First, all PMT family members share three conserved sequence motifs but, these show significant variations between PMT1/PMT2 and PMT4 subfamily members (18Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Google Scholar). Second, the PMT1/PMT2 and PMT4 subfamilies use distinct acceptor protein substrates in vivo (9Sanders S.L. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Herskowitz I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1177-1188Google Scholar, 14Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 481-486Google Scholar). Third, in fungi the PMT1/PMT2 subfamily is highly redundant, whereas the PMT4 subfamily has only one representative per species (17Willer T. Amselgruber W. Deutzmann R. Strahl S. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 771-783Google Scholar, 18Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Google Scholar). Among the PMT family members, Pmtp1 from S. cerevisiae has been most extensively characterized. Pmt1p is an integral ER membrane glycoprotein with seven transmembrane-spanning domains (19Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Google Scholar). Its N terminus faces the cytoplasm whereas the C terminus faces the lumen of the ER. Two major hydrophilic domains that are located between transmembrane spans one and two (loop 1) and transmembrane spans five and six (loop 5), respectively, are oriented toward the ER lumen and are essential for Pmt1p activity (18Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Google Scholar, 19Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Google Scholar). The replacement of invariant amino acid residues in these regions suggested that these segments are involved in the recognition and/or binding of protein substrates and/or catalysis (18Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Google Scholar). Comparison of PMTs from different organisms defined highly conserved peptide motifs present in loop 5 (18Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Google Scholar), which are also found in IP3 and ryanodine receptors. Their common function is unknown (20Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 48-50Google Scholar). Pmt1p forms a heteromeric complex with Pmt2p in vivo, and this complex formation is essential for maximal mannosyltransferase activity (18Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Google Scholar, 21Gentzsch M. Immervoll T. Tanner W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 128-130Google Scholar). N- and C-terminal regions of Pmt1p are involved in Pmt1p-Pmt2p interactions (18Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Google Scholar). Other than Pmt1p, very little is known about the molecular organization of the rest of the O-mannosylation machinery. In the present study we analyzed the molecular assembly of the PMT family in yeast. We demonstrate that complex formation is of general validity for all members of the PMT family in S. cerevisiae. Strikingly, members of the PMT1 subfamily form specific heteromeric complexes with members of the PMT2 subfamily in vivo, while Pmt4p acts as a homomeric complex. Despite the differences between PMT1/PMT2 and PMT4 complexes, we show that the same rules and residues govern Pmtp protein-protein interactions. The S. cerevisiae strains are listed in Table I. Yeast strains were grown under standard conditions and transformed following the method of Gietz et al. (27Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H.

Sdicu A.M. Bussey H. Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2770-2775Google Scholar) into pBluescript SK+(Stratagene) digested with the same enzymes. From the resulting plasmid pVG70 a 2.97-kb PstI/SalI fragment was isolated and cloned into YEp352 (cut with PstI and SalI), resulting in plasmid pVG76. A total of six copies of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope were fused to the C terminus of PMT2 by recombinant PCR (31Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar). Two separate PCR products that overlap in sequence were produced. One was amplified by PCR on pVG76 with the oligonucleotides vg65 and vg66, the other on plasmid pHA-kanMX (gift of U. Schermer) with the oligonucleotides vg67 and vg68. The overlapping, primary PCR products were combined into one longer product using oligonucleotides vg65 and vg68. The resulting 730-bp fragment was cloned into pGEM T-easy (Promega). A 695-bpBglII/SalI fragment of the resulting plasmid pVG78 was subcloned into pVG76 (cut with BglII andSalI). DNA sequence analysis of the resulting plasmid pVG80 (PMT2HA) was performed. In the course of this analysis, we realized a discrepancy between the PMT2sequence we obtained and the yeast data base entry (GenBankTM accession no. AAC04934). To verify thePMT2 sequence, we amplified a 664-bp genomic DNA fragment ofPMT2 from the yeast strains S288c, BY4742, W303–1A, and SEY6210 using the oligonucleotides vg63 and vg69. PCR products were cloned into pGEM T-easy, and several independent clones were sequenced. These analyses showed that in contrast to the data base entry, thePMT2 open reading frame contains three additional base pairs (bp +400 to +429 is tgggacttccCttctggGGaaatttaccca; additional bases in capital letters). The insertions result in the predicted amino acid sequence of Pro-Ser-Gly instead of Leu-Leu at position 137 of Pmt2p. A copy of the FLAG sequence (32Brizzard B.L. Chubet R.G. Vizard D.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 730-745Google Scholar) was obtained by annealing oligonucleotides oligo211 with oligo212. The annealed oligo pair features BamHI andNotI overhang sequences. The FLAG sequence was joined by a three-piece ligation with a 0.7-kb SacI/NotI fragment (isolated from plasmid SAP/EN, Ref. 33Truernit E. Schmid J. Epple P. Illig J. Sauer N. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2169-2182Google Scholar) that contains the yeast plasma membrane ATPase terminator (34Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Google Scholar) and the yeast shuttle vector pRS423 (digested with SacI and NotI) resulting in plasmid pRS423/TER/FLAG. The PMT4 promoter and coding region (bp −675 to +2286) was amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA using oligonucleotides oligo213 and oligo214. The PCR fragment was digested with BamHI andSalI, and cloned into pRS423/TER/FLAG. Additional FLAG sequences were cloned into the BamHI site of the resulting plasmid pJK4, using the annealed oligonucleotide pair oligo233/oligo234. In the resulting plasmid (pJK4-B1) four copies of the FLAG epitope were fused to the C terminus of PMT4. To remove amino acids (aa) 394–521 of Pmt4p, plasmid pJK4-B1 was digested withPflMI/HpaI and religated using the adapter oligonucleotides vg23 and vg24. An arginine residue at position 142 of Pmt4pFLAG was exchanged for a glutamate by site-directed mutagenesis (GeneEditor™, Promega) using the oligonucleotide vg30 and plasmid pVG43 (pUC18, containing bp +24 to +1165 of PMT4). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the resulting plasmid pVG44. A 476-bp MunI fragment of pVG44 was cloned into pVG42 (pUC18, containing bp +307 to +1165 of PMT4) digested with the same enzyme. From the resulting plasmid pVG69 a 1.87-kb SphI/HpaI fragment was isolated and cloned into pJK4-B1 resulting in pVG45. Amino acid Arg-138 of Pmt1pHA was changed to lysine by site-directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotide vg16 and plasmid pVG26 (pUC19, containing bp +61 to +537 of PMT1). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. A 335-bp NcoI/BsrGI fragment of the resulting plasmid pVG29 was cloned into plasmid pVG20 (pUC19, containing a 990-bp EcoRI/PstI fragment of pSB56, Ref. 18Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Google Scholar) cut with NcoI/BsrGI. From the resulting plasmid pVG28 a 594-bp PmlI/BsrGI fragment was isolated and cloned into pSB56 to generate pVG36. Rabbits were immunized with recombinant fusion proteins consisting of glutathione S-transferase, and the aa Met-1 to Arg-78 of S. cerevisiae Pmt3p, aa Met-1 to Ala-65 of Pmt4p, aa Asp-10 to Thr-121 of Pmt5p, and aa Met-1 to Gln-85 of Pmt6p, respectively. The corresponding DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using genomic S. cerevisiae DNA as template and adapter oligonucleotides oligo151/oligo152 for PMT3, oligo106/oligo107 for PMT4, oligo143b/oligo144 forPMT5, oligo147/oligo148 for PMT6. The respective DNA fragments were combined with the glutathioneS-transferase sequence by EcoRI/BamHI subcloning into a pGEX-2TK expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli host BL21. The recombinant proteins were excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels and injected into rabbits. Pineda Antikoerper-Service, Berlin, Germany, performed immunizations. Antibodies were affinity-purified by binding to nitrocellulose derivatized with the glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein (35Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Google Scholar). Crude membranes were isolated as described (18Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Google Scholar). Sodium deoxycholate extracts were prepared as described (18Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Pmt1pHA, Pmt2pHA and Pmt3–6p was performed using 300 ॖl of sodium deoxycholate extract made from 109 cells of the appropriate yeast strains. Pmt1pHA was immunoprecipitated with 10 ॖl of anti-HA monoclonal antibody covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose (16B12, Babco) for 1–2 h at 4 °C. To precipitate Pmt3–6p, affinity-purified polyclonal anti-Pmt3–6p antibodies were covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose (Pmt3–6p beads) as described (36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Pmt3–6p were immunoprecipitated with 20–50 ॖl of Pmt3–6p beads for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 107 (v/v) glycerol, 0.357 sodium deoxycholate, 0.57 Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.25 mmNα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 50 ॖg/ml TPCK, 10 ॖg/ml leupeptin, and 1 ॖg/ml pepstatin) and once with 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline. Subsequently, precipitates were resuspended in 20 ॖl of 3× SDS sample buffer. Pmt4pFLAG and FLAG-tagged Pmt4p mutant proteins were solubilized from crude membranes, prepared as described in Ref. 18Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Google Scholarusing 500 ॖl of solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 0.57 Triton X-100, plus protease inhibitors) by vortexing for 30 min at 4 °C. The suspension was clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 rpm (Sorvall SS34 rotor) to obtain the Triton extract. FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated for 1–2 h at 4 °C from 300 ॖl of Triton extract, using 30 ॖl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity Gel (Sigma). Precipitates were washed four times with 1 ml of cold solubilization buffer, once with 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline and resuspended in 20 ॖl of 3× SDS-sample buffer. Yeast cells were grown to 2–4 × 107 cells/ml in YPD medium (37Kaiser C.A. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). A total of 1010 cells were harvested and crude membranes were isolated (18Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Google Scholar) using a modified buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 157 (v/v) glycerol, plus protease inhibitors). Membranes were resuspended in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.57 Nonidet P-40, 750 mmaminocaproic acid, 157 (v/v) glycerol, plus protease inhibitors). Membrane proteins were solubilized by vortexing for 20 min at room temperature. The suspension was clarified by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min. Samples (40 ॖg of protein) were loaded onto polyacrylamide gradient gels. Just prior to electrophoresis, Coomassie Brilliant Blue G (Serva; dissolved in 500 mm aminocaproic acid) was added from a 57 stock solution to adjust to a detergent/Coomassie ratio of 4:1 (g/g). Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) was performed using a polyacrylamide gradient from 4–137, with a 47 stacking gel, as described (38Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Google Scholar). 0.027 Nonidet P-40 was added to both polyacrylamide gel and cathode buffer (50 mm Tricine, 15 mmBis-Tris). The cathode buffer also contained 0.027 Coomassie Brilliant Blue G. This buffer was replaced after electrophoresis for 1 h at 80 V, 4 °C, by cathode buffer without Coomassie Blue. Electrophoresis was continued for ∼6 h at 100 V, 4 °C. Gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using 20 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, 207 MeOH, 0.027 SDS. 2.0 × 109 yeast cells from a logarithmically growing culture were harvested at 3,000 × g, 4 °C and washed once with 20 ml of OPA buffer (50 mm boric acid/sodium tetraborate, pH 8.0). The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 ॖl of OPA buffer plus protease inhibitors. Crude membranes were prepared as described (18Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Google Scholar). The membrane pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of OPA buffer without protease inhibitors and centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 rpm (Sorvall, SS34 rotor). Subsequently, membranes were resuspended in 500 ॖl of OPA buffer. For cross-linking, o-phtaldialdehyde (OPA; Sigma) was added to final concentrations of 25–200 ॖm to 100 ॖl of membrane suspension and incubated in the dark for 30 min at 25 °C. The reaction was quenched with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE or BN-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Polyclonal anti-Pmt1p (39Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 185-190Google Scholar) and anti-Wbp1p (40Te Heesen S. Knauer R. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 279-284Google Scholar) antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:2000, and anti-Pmt2p (21Gentzsch M. Immervoll T. Tanner W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 128-130Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:1000. Affinity-purified antibodies anti-Pmt4p, anti-Pmt5p, and anti-Pmt6p were used at a dilution of 1:2500; anti-Pmt3p at a dilution of 1:500. The anti-HA (16B12, Babco) and anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) monoclonal antibodies were used at 1:8000 and 1:5000 dilutions, respectively. Protein-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the Amersham Biosciences ECL system. Dol-P-Man:protein O-mannosyltransferase activity was measured as described (14Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 481-486Google Scholar). To uncover common principles that underlie the functionality of Pmtps we investigated whether complex formation is a general feature of the yeast PMT family members. We generated polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognize S. cerevisiae Pmt3p (predicted molecular mass, 86.2 kDa), Pmt4p (predicted mass, 87.8 kDa), Pmt5p (predicted mass, 84.8 kDa), and Pmt6p (predicted mass, 87.9 kDa) in wild-type yeast as shown by Western blot analyses (Fig.1, lanes 1, 3,5, and 7). Extracts from the correspondingpmt deletion strains contained no cross-reactive material, proving that the antibodies are highly specific (Fig. 1, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). We also created epitope-tagged versions of Pmt2p (Pmt2pHA) and Pmt4p (Pmt4pFLAG) (described under 舠Experimental Procedures舡). These tools enabled us to detect PMT complexes isolated by coimmunoprecipitation, BN-PAGE, and chemical cross-linking. To characterize PMT complexes, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using a HA epitope-tagged version ofS. cerevisiae Pmt1p (Pmt1pHA, Ref. 18Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Google Scholar). Pmt1pHA was expressed in a pmt1 deletion strain and solubilized from crude membranes using Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate. Pmt1pHA was immunoprecipitated from sodium deoxycholate extracts with monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡). The immunoprecipitate and an aliquot of the sodium deoxycholate extract were resolved on 87 SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blotting and sequentially probing the blots with polyclonal antibodies to Pmt1p to Pmt6p (Fig.2A, lanes 1 and2). To ensure the specificity of the immunoprecipitation reaction the same experiment was performed using strainpmt1Δ expressing Pmt1p without the HA tag (Fig.2A, lanes 3 and 4). As shown previously (21Gentzsch M. Immervoll T. Tanner W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 128-130Google Scholar) we confirmed that Pmt2p is the major interacting partner of Pmt1p (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Moreover, a weak signal for Pmt3p could be specifically detected in the Pmt1pHA immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2A, comparelanes 2 and 3). The amount of coimmunoprecipitated Pmt3p was small, but this result was highly reproducible. In contrast, Pmt4p, Pmt5p, or Pmt6p could not be detected (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Coimmunoprecipitation of Pmt1pHA from pmt3 (Fig. 2B,lane 4) and pmt2 (Fig. 2B, lane 6) deletion strains showed that Pmt1pHA interacts with Pmt2p independently of Pmt3p and vice versa. To circumstantiate the existence of distinct Pmt1p-Pmt2p and Pmt1p-Pmt3p complexes a HA-tagged version of Pmt2p was expressed in strain pmt2Δ and coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described above. Fig. 2C shows that Pmt2pHA specifically binds to Pmt1p but not Pmt3p, Pmt4p, or Pmt6p (lane 2) corroborating that Pmt1p intera"

It remains unclear whether ABCA1 functions to efflux cholesterol across the basolateral or apical membrane of the intestine. We used a chicken model of ABCA1 dysfunction, the Wisconsin hypoalpha mutant (WHAM) chicken, to address this issue. After an oral gavage of radioactive cholesterol, the percentage appearing in the bloodstream was reduced by 79% in the WHAM chicken along with a 97% reduction in the amount of tracer in high density lipoprotein. In contrast, the percentage of radioactive cholesterol absorbed from the lumen into the intestine was not affected by the ABCA1 mutation. Liver X receptor (LXR) agonists have been inferred to decrease cholesterol absorption through activation of ABCA1 expression. However, the LXR agonist T0901317 decreased cholesterol absorption equally in both wild type and WHAM chickens, indicating that the effect of LXR activation on cholesterol absorption is independent of ABCA1. The ABCA1mutation resulted in accumulation of radioactive cholesterol ester in the intestine and the liver of the WHAM chicken (5.0- and 4.4-fold, respectively), whereas biliary lipid concentrations were unaltered by the WHAM mutation.

It is postulated that this is due to the role of HDL in reverse cholesterol transport from the cells of the arterial wall (1von Eckardstein A. Nofer J. Assman G. Atheroscler.

Reverse cholesterol transport involves the HDL-mediated transport of cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues to the liver, allowing for cells to rid themselves of excess cholesterol and maintain cholesterol balance. The selective uptake of HDL cholesterol ester (CE) by the liver is mediated by scavenger receptor-BI and subsequent conversion of cholesterol into bile acids allows for excretion of cholesterol into bile (2Attie A.D.

The incomplete intestinal reabsorption of these biliary components, concomitant with the sloughing off of intestinal enterocytes, constitutes the major route of cholesterol elimination from the body via fecal excretion. ATP binding cassette transporters comprise a large family of membrane-spanning proteins that are responsible for transporting a variety of substrates in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Many of these transporters are responsible for the translocation of lipophilic substrates such as phospholipids, bile acids, and sterols (4Dean M. Yannick H. Chimini G. J.

A hallmark of Tangier disease is CE accumulation in many tissues, particularly the reticuloendothelial system (13Assman G. von Eckardstein A. Brewer H.B. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 7th Ed. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1995: 2053-2072Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of ABCA1 and HDL in maintaining cholesterol balance. The HDL deficiency found in Tangier disease and familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia is due to the hypercatabolism of lipid-poor apoAI. The amphipathic apoAI protein is synthesized and secreted in a lipid-poor state by the liver and intestine and must acquire phospholipid and cholesterol during and after the secretory process to form pre-β-HDL. The subsequent reaction catalyzed by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase allows for the transfer of an acyl group from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to cholesterol, forming CE that partitions to the core of the HDL particle and allows for a high capacity cholesterol sink. Dysfunctional ABCA1 prevents the early lipidation step in HDL biogenesis, thereby preventing the ability of HDL to serve in reverse cholesterol transport (14Schaefer E.J. Blum C.B. Levy R.I.

Aside from the efflux of lipid to form HDL, ABCA1 has been implicated in controlling cholesterol flux at the apical membrane of the liver and the intestine, potentially influencing biliary lipid concentration and dietary cholesterol absorption, respectively. Both LXR agonists and agonists of the LXR heterodimeric partner, RXR, have been shown to drastically decrease intestinal cholesterol absorption in mice while simultaneously increasing intestinal ABCA1 expression due to the transactivation of the ABCA1 promoter (16Repa J.J.

Similar to Tangier disease, the WHAM chickens have a 90% reduction in HDL and apoAI levels, resulting in a greater than 70% decrease in serum phospholipid and cholesterol levels (38Poernama F. Schreyer S.A. Bitgood J.J. Cook M.E. Attie A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 955-963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the autosomal location of ABCA1 in humans and mice, ABCA1 in chickens is sex-linked on the Z chromosome, giving rise to hemizygous females (Z/−) and homozygous males (ZZ) (39McGibbon W.H. J. Heredity. 1981; 72: 139-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Plasma apoAI concentrations in normal chickens correlate withABCA1 gene dosage; females and heterozygous males have half the normal male apoAI levels (38Poernama F. Schreyer S.A. Bitgood J.J. Cook M.E. Attie A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 955-963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured hepatocyte and intestinal loop experiments concluded that apoAI secretion is unaffected in the WHAM chicken. Subsequent experiments showed that the WHAM chicken lacks the ability to efficiently lipidate free apoAI, shown by the drastically increased catabolism of 125I-labeled apoAI, in contrast to a much slower rate of 125I-labeled HDL catabolism (15Schreyer S.A. Hart L.K. Attie A.D. Atheroscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 2053-2059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Poernama F. Schreyer S.A. Bitgood J.J. Cook M.E. Attie A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 955-963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies showed that the E89K mutation results in intracellular accumulation of ABCA1, decreasing plasma membrane ABCA1 expression by 80–90% of wild type ABCA1 (determined by cell surface biotinylation) and resulting in a complete loss of function assayed by both annexin-V and apoAI binding (37Attie A.D. Hamon Y. Brooks-Wilson A.R. Gray-Keller M.P. MacDonald M.L.E. Rigot V. Tebon A. Zhang L.-H. Mulligan J. Singaraja R.R. Bitgood J.J. Cook M.E. Kastelein J.J.P. Chimini G. Hayden M.R. J.

However, investigation into the membrane topology of ABCA1 concludes that the 2261-amino acid protein adopts a type-II transmembrane orientation, placing a loop of ∼600 amino acids, including position 89, into the exoplasmic space (40Fitzgerald M.L.

Therefore, the WHAM chicken is a unique animal model for investigating the role of ABCA1 in cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism. Here, we provide data suggesting that the WHAM chicken has impaired basolateral, but not apical, cholesterol transport during dietary cholesterol absorption, with concomitant CE accumulation in liver and intestine. Furthermore, treatment of animals with the LXR agonist, T0901317, decreased intestinal cholesterol absorption similarly in both wild type and WHAM chickens, dispelling ABCA1 as the LXR-regulated gene responsible for decreased cholesterol absorption in the intestine. Chickens were obtained from a flock maintained by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Poultry Science Department. The chickens were fed ad libitum a standard University of Wisconsin poultry diet (0.01% cholesterol and 4.3% fat). For the experiments described, age-matched male chickens between 4 and 8 weeks of age were used. Animals fasted for 5 h prior to the experiment were given 500 μl of CAPTEX medium chain triglyceride oil 10 min prior to [3H]cholesterol gavage, as well as 4 and 8 h later. [1,2-3H]cholesterol (100 μCi/animal; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) was dried under N2 and resuspended in 50 μl of EtOH. 1 ml/animal of phosphate-buffered saline containing 4 mg/ml egg PC (type XVI-E; Sigma) was added and sonicated briefly. Bovine serum albumin was added to 5 mg/ml, and the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g in a SS-34 rotor. 1 ml of the liposome suspension was delivered by oral gavage and was immediately followed by 1 ml of H2O. Blood was collected from the wing vein, and a 300-μl aliquot of each plasma sample was adjusted to d = 1.090 g/ml using a 1.30 g/ml NaBr solution and underlaid beneath 12 ml of buffer of density 1.063 g/ml and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 42 h at 10 °C in a 70.1 Ti rotor. Folch extraction (42Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was performed on whole plasma or gradient fractions, and the organic extracts were subsequently counted by liquid scintillation counting (LSC; Packard Tri-Carb 2900TR). Density gradient radioactivity recovery was comparable with total plasma radioactivity. Total animal plasma values were estimated using the individual animal weights and the specific activity of the plasma or fraction (43Sturkie P.D. Avian Physiology. 2nd Ed. Cornell University Press, New York1965: 109-117Google Scholar). For HDL supplementation experiments, animals received either purified wild type HDL or saline via intravenous injection prior to oral gavage. HDL-cholesterol-supplemented WHAM chickens were maintained at plasma cholesterol concentrations at least 13-fold higher than unsupplemented WHAM animals for the time course of the experiment. Plasma was collected from wild type male chickens, adjusted to d = 1.063 g/ml, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 0.5 mm and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 28 h at 15 °C in a 50.2 Ti rotor. The infranatant was adjusted to d = 1.21 g/ml and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 36 h at 15 °C. HDL was collected from the surface, dialyzed to phosphate-buffered saline, and filter-sterilized with a 0.2-μm filter. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the absence of apoB-containing lipoproteins and enrichment of apoAI. The final protein/cholesterol ratio of the purified HDL ranged between 1.5 and 1.95. Purified wild type or WHAM HDL was labeled with [4-14C]cholesterol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) by incubating 375 μg of HDL protein with 1 ml of [14C]cholesterol-PC-liposomes (20 μg/ml PC) overnight at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm diethylp-nitrophenyl phosphate. Labeled HDL was recovered by density gradient ultracentrifugation as described above. Fasted animals were placed under isoflurane anesthesia, catheterized in the jugular vein, and injected with [14C]cholesterol-HDL. Blood was sampled from the wing vein, and radioactivity was quantitated by LSC. HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) was isolated from plasma using an equivalent volume of an HDL-precipitating reagent (Sigma). The apparent fractional clearance rates were determined gravimetrically by measuring the area under the radioactivity disappearance curves. PC-liposomes containing 1 μCi of [5,6-3H]-β-sitostanol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) and 1 μCi of [14C]cholesterol per animal were delivered via oral gavage after a 4-h fast. Animals were givenad libitum access to food and water after gavage. Total feces were collected into Petri dishes after 24 and 48 h, desiccated, ground, and weighed. Triplicate 30-mg aliquots of each feces sample were solubilized and analyzed with a dual label program on the LSC. Cholesterol absorption was determined by calculating the total fecal recovery of [14C]cholesterol or by comparing the initial and fecal 14C/3H isotopic ratio (44Quintao E. Grundy S.M. Ahrens Jr., E.H. J. Lipid Res. 1971; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the following equation: percentage of cholesterol absorption = (1 − ((14C/3H)feces/(14C/3H)initial))100. However, the data used in this paper are derived from total fecal [14C]cholesterol recovery, because the small amount of sitostanol that is absorbed can lead to an overestimation of cholesterol absorption (data not shown). Plasma lipoproteins were fractionated on a Superose 6HR 10/30 FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences). The equivalent of 100 μl of plasma was injected onto the column. 500-μl fractions were collected and assayed for total cholesterol and triglyceride using the Infinity cholesterol reagent and Infinity triglyceride reagent (Sigma). Plasma concentrations of unesterified and esterified cholesterol were determined using the Free Cholesterol C and Cholesterol CII kits (Wako, Richmond, VA). For triglyceride analysis, tissues were collected after a 4-h fast from 5-week old wild type and WHAM male chickens on day 5 of treatment with T0901317 or vehicle alone. 100 mg of whole tissue was homogenized in 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with a Potter-Elvejhem homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Lipid from 45 μl of homogenate was extracted by the Bligh-Dyer method (45Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42352) Google Scholar), dried under N2, and measured essentially as described in Briaud et al. (46Briaud I. Harmon J.S. Kelpe C.L. Segu V.B.G. Poitout V. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The dried lipid was resuspended by the addition of 30 μl of Thesit (Fluka Biochemika) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, with periodic vortexing. After the addition of 50 μl of isopropyl alcohol, triglyceride was determined with the GPO-Trinder colorimetric assay (Sigma). Protein determination was by the Lowry method (47Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 5 μl of homogenate. For cholesterol and cholesterol ester analysis, ∼5 mg of tissue homogenate protein was lipid-extracted, dried under N2, and resuspended in 10 μl of CHCl3. After the addition of 90 μl of 10% Triton-X100 in isopropyl alcohol, the sample was vortexed for 10 s, supplemented with 3 ml of Free Cholesterol C or Cholesterol CII reagent (Wako), and assayed according to the manufacturer's instructions except that samples were vortexed to clarity prior to absorbance measurement. Total tissue [14C]cholesterol retention in the various tissues was determined by solubilizing tissue in alcoholic KOH (6 parts 50% KOH, 94 parts EtOH) at 65 °C and analyzing an aliquot by LSC. An aliquot of the liver and jejunum was used to make a 10% (w/v) tissue homogenate in phosphate-buffered saline, Folch-extracted, and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (Silica Gel 150; Whatman) using a solvent system of hexane/ethyl ether/glacial acetic acid (90:20:1). Animals were given 30 mpk/day of the nonsteroidal LXR agonist T0901317 (Tularik) (16Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.-M.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M.

Untreated animals received the vehicle only. Animals were given ad libitumaccess to food and water during the experiment except when 4-h fasting blood samples were taken at 0, 72, and 96 h post-treatment. While collecting data for subsequent analyses, on rare occasions we found that individual animals treated with T0901317 gave values indicative of hypersensitivity to the compound. These individuals yielded values far greater than three S.D. values from the mean for their respective groups. These outliers were removed from the analyses. No vehicle-treated animals were removed. Animals used for mRNA analysis were fasted for 4 h prior to tissue collection. Total RNA was isolated using the RNA-Bee reagent (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) and purified using the RNeasy kit with DNase digestion (Qiagen). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed from 1 μg of total RNA from each animal with random hexamer primers using the Superscript II first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Specific primers for each gene were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). The real time PCR contained, in a final volume of 25 μl, 25 ng of reverse transcribed total RNA and 240 nm forward and reverse primers and was performed using SYBR Green Core Reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PCR was carried out in 96-well plates using the GeneAmp 5700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). All reactions were done in duplicate. The relative amount of all mRNAs was calculated using the comparativeC method (49Applied Biosystems User Bulletin No. 2, Rev. B. Applied Biosystems, Forester City, CA2001Google Scholar). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was used as the invariant control. Primer sequences are available upon request. Chicken liver and jejunum homogenates were prepared from frozen tissues, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P; Millipore), and probed for ABCA1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (50Wellington C.L.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), except that animals were fasted for 4 h prior to tissue collection. Sterol response element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) was detected using the monoclonal 2A4 SREBP-1 antibody (ATCC). SCD1 was detected using a polyclonal rabbit anti-human SCD1 antibody (Xenon Genetics). VLDL receptor/vitellogenin receptor was detected using a polyclonal rabbit anti-human LDLR354antibody (52Dirlam K.A. Gretch D.G. LaCount D.J. Sturley S.L. Attie A.D. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 489-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Detection of signal was performed with the ECL or ECF Western blot detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Band densities were quantified using ImageQuant 5.0 software. Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed Student's t test assuming equal variance. Multiple regression analysis was performed using PROC MIXED in SAS (SAS 8.00). To determine the role of ABCA1 in the absorption of dietary cholesterol from the intestinal lumen, the appearance of dietary [3H]cholesterol in the circulation was followed over a 24-h time course after oral gavage with [3H]cholesterol-liposomes. The WHAM chickens showed a severely reduced level of plasma [3H]cholesterol relative to wild type, reaching only 21% of wild type after 24 h (Fig.1A; p < 0.001). This difference is mainly attributable to a lack of [3H]cho"
https://openalex.org/W2051340466,"The current study examines the contribution of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) intert-butyl-hydroperoxide (TBH)-induced apoptotic signaling using clones of undifferentiated pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells that stably overexpress the human mitochondrial or cytoplasmic forms of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (viz. Mn-SOD or CuZn-SOD, respectively). Exposure of wild type cells to TBH caused an early generation of ROS (30 min) that resulted in cell apoptosis at 24 h. These responses were attenuated with N-acetylcysteine pretreatment; however, N-acetylcysteine was ineffective in cytoprotection when added after TBH-induced ROS formation. Stable overexpression of SOD isoforms caused a 2- and 3.5-fold elevation in CuZn-SOD and Mn-SOD activities in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, respectively, and 3-fold increases in cellular GSH content. Accordingly, the stable overexpression of Mn-SOD attenuated TBH-induced mitochondrial ROS generation and cell apoptosis. Whereas transient Mn-SOD expression similarly prevented PC-12 apoptosis, this was associated with increases in SOD activity but not GSH, indicating that cytoprotection by Mn-SOD overexpression is related to mitochondrial ROS elimination and not due to increases in cellular GSH content per se. Stable or transient CuZn-SOD overexpression exacerbated cell apoptosis in conjunction with accelerated caspase-3 activation, regardless of cell GSH levels. Collectively, our results support a role for mitochondrial ROS in TBH-induced PC-12 apoptosis that is attenuated by Mn-SOD overexpression and is independent of cellular GSH levelsper se.

Samali A. Orrenius S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of mitochondrial generated ROS to the initiation of apoptotic signaling and the roles that the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme, manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD),1 and the cytoplasmic copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) play in modulating oxidant-induced cell apoptosis are not completely resolved. Previous studies in animal and cell models of SOD overexpression have demonstrated that overexpression of CuZn-SOD and Mn-SOD can both be beneficial and detrimental. For instance, different studies have shown that CuZn-SOD overexpression rendered mice more susceptible to infection (2Golenser J. Peled-Kamar M. Schwartz E. Friedman I. Groner Y. Pollack Y. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), induced muscle aberrations (3Peled-Kamar M. Lotem J. Wirguin I. Weiner L. Hermalin A. Groner Y. Proc. Natl.

Hamdy R.C. Epstein C.J. Chua B.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In comparison, overexpression of Mn-SOD has generally exerted protective effects, such as protection of murine fibrosarcoma cells from 5-azacytadine-dependent apoptosis (7Zhao Y. Kiningham K.K. Lin S.M. St. Clair D.K. Antiox. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), attenuation of hyperglycemic-induced bovine endothelial cells oxidative stress (8Wallace D.C. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 106: 71-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and protection against adriamycin-induced acute cardiac toxicity (9Yen S.C. Oberley T.D. Vichitbandha S. Ho Y.S. St. Clair D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Moreover, increased oxidative damage has been found to be associated with altered mitochondrial function in heterozygous Mn-SOD knockout mice (10Williams M.D. Van Remmen H. Conrad C.C. Huang T.T. Epstein C.J. Richardson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28510-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). However, increased invasiveness of tumor metastasis has been associated with Mn-SOD overexpression (11Lam E.W. Zwacka R. Seftor E.A. Nieva D.R. Davidson B.L. Engelhardt J.F. Hendrix M.J. Oberley L.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The quantitative significance of SOD overexpression in cell apoptosis is poorly defined. Moreover, a direct link between SOD overexpression and the intracellular antioxidant status, such as GSH, has not been vigorously explored. Previous studies have shown that as compared with control animals, transgenic mice overexpressing the heterozygous form of Mn-SOD (Mn-SOD−/+) exhibited a decrease of 30–50% reduced GSH in several tissues, such as the lung, brain, and muscle (12Van Remmen H. Salvador C. Yang H. Huang T.T. Epstein C.J. Richardson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Notably, as these animals age, Mn-SOD transgenic mice exhibited increased muscle apoptosis when compared with age-matched controls (12Van Remmen H. Salvador C. Yang H. Huang T.T. Epstein C.J. Richardson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In other studies, an overall increase in tissue GSH content was found to be associated with transgenic mice overexpressing CuZn-SOD (13Turrens J.F. Med. Hypotheses. 2001; 56: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, the relationship between overexpression of the two different isoforms of SOD and the intracellular GSH status and how these changes contribute to oxidant-induced initiation of cell apoptosis has not been thoroughly investigated. The objective of the current study was designed to address these questions using tert-butyl-hydroperoxide (TBH) as a model hydroperoxide and undifferentiated pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells, a cell model that has been previously characterized by Greene and Tischler (14Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4862) Google Scholar), to study the cellular and molecular aspects of neuronal apoptosis following induction of cell differentiation in culture with nerve growth factor. To address our hypothesis that mitochondrial derived ROS are an important functional mediator of TBH-induced apoptosis in PC-12 cells, we have generated PC-12 clones that overexpress the human mitochondrial Mn-SOD or the human cytoplasmic CuZn-SOD. Given the central role that the mitochondria play in the initiation of the apoptotic cascade mediated by oxidants and redox imbalance (1Chandra J. Samali A. Orrenius S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 15Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar), we determined the contribution of mitochondrial ROS and cellular redox shifts to cell apoptosis in PC-12 cells that stably or transiently overexpress Mn-SOD or CuZn-SOD. The following chemicals were obtained from Sigma: agarose, TBH, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and DNA markers (ΦX174 HaeIII and λEcoRI-HindIII). Fetal calf serum and horse serum were obtained from Atlanta Biologicals (Norcross, GA). Monoclonal antibodies against Bax, BcL-2, and CPP32 were acquired from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and the monoclonal antibody against β-actin was bought from Oncogene (Cambridge, MA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was obtained from Invitrogen. Nitrocellulose membranes were acquired from Bio-Rad. The enhanced chemiluminescence system for Western immunoblot (ECL) and the hyperfilm were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Fluorescent mounting medium was obtained from DAKO Corp. (Carpinteria, CA). 12-mm circle number 1 glass cover slips used for DAPI staining were procured from Fisher. The cDNAs for human Mn-SOD and CuZn-SOD were generously provided by Dr. Sonia Flores (Webb-Waring Institute, Denver, CO). The pRetro-Off expression vectors were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Pheochromocytoma cells (PC-12) were a generous gift from Dr. Nikki Holbrook (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Wild type PC-12 cells as well as PC-12 clones that were stably transfected with the pRetro-Off vector or pRetro-Off vector containing human Mn-SOD or CuZn-SOD were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 humidified environment. PC-12 clones were selected in puromycin (1.5 nmol/ml), and the culture medium was changed every 2 days. For all experiments, wild type PC12 cells or PC-12 clones were plated at a specified density the day before the experiment was performed. On the day of the experiment, the culture media were replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. TBH was added to cell cultures at a final concentration of 100 μm. In designated experiments, cells were treated with the following agents at the specified final concentrations: NAC, 5 mm; rotenone, 50 μm; antimycin A, 1 μm. DAPI staining was performed according to the method of Wang et al. (16Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 105 wild type cells or PC12 clones were grown on 12-mm circular glass cover slips in 24-well plates. Cells were treated with 100 μm TBH for 24 h, washed with PBS, and fixed with cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were then washed with PBS, fixed with cold 70% ethanol at −20 °C for at least 1 h, and stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI for 30 min in the dark. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS and mounted using DAKO fluorescent mounting fluid onto microscope slides. Cells were viewed and counted using a fluorescent Olympus Bx50 microscope with the ×20 objective. At least six fields of total and apoptotic cells were counted on each slide. A total of 200 cells were counted. Cellular glutathione (GSH and GSSG) was determined by the high performance liquid chromatography method of Reed et al. (17Reed D.J. Babson J.R. Beatty P.W. Brodie A.E. Ellis W.W. Potter D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 106) were cultured in 100-mm culture plates and exposed to TBH in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. At time points ranging from 0 to 6 h, cells were washed with PBS and then harvested by scraping in ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. The cell suspensions were centrifuged to remove the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble proteins. The acid supernatant was derivatized with 6 mm iodoacetic acid and 1% 2,4-dinitrophenyl fluorobenzene to yield the S-carboxymethyl and 2,4-dinitrophenyl derivatives of GSH and GSSG, respectively. Separation of GSH and GSSG derivatives was performed on a 250 × 4.6-mm Alltech Lichrosorb NH2 10-μm column. Cellular GSH and GSSG contents were quantified by comparison with standards derivatized in the same manner. PC12 clones (2 × 106) were plated in a T-25 flask. After treatment with 100 μm TBH for specified times from 0–6 h, cells were ruptured with 300–600 μl of lysis buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.8 mg/ml iodoacetamide for 30 min at 4 °C. Adherent cells were scraped, and whole cell extracts were prepared by homogenization. Cell extracts were stored at −20 °C until Western analyses. Twenty μg of total cellular protein was resolved on 12% acrylamide gels (100 V, 90 min) and blotted onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with anti-CPP32 (1:500). The secondary antibody used corresponded to the primary antibody (goat and mouse) and was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1000). Detection of chemiluminescence was performed with an ECL Western blotting detection reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The membrane was stripped in 6.25 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 15 min and probed again for β-actin to verify equal protein loading in each lane. PC12 clones were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells and were harvested at the indicated times (0–6 h) after TBH treatment according to the method of Stefanis et al. (18Stefanis L. Troy C.M. Qi H. Shelanski M.L. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9204-9215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were scraped and collected into buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml each pepstatin and leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated. The nuclear pellets were separated from supernatants by centrifugation (1,500 rpm, 5 min). The pellets were stored at −20 °C for Western analyses of PARP and its degradation product. Twenty μg of the protein was resolved on an 8% acrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with 1:1000 dilution of PARP (rabbit anti-mouse polyclonal antibody) and secondary IgG antibody 1:1000 and then treated with ECL and exposed to film. Total cellular oxidant formation was measured using the oxidant-sensitive nonfluorescent probe, dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR). Previous studies have utilized oxidation of DHR for the detection of general cellular oxidant production given that DHR oxidation is mediated by biological oxidants like peroxynitrite and a variety of secondary hydrogen peroxide-dependent intracellular reactions such as H2O2-cytochrome cand H2O2-Fe2+ (19Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 20Ischiropoulos H. Gow A. Thom S.R. Kooy N. Royall J.A. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Intracellular two-electron oxidation of DHR results in the formation of the fluorescent product, rhodamine 123, which preferentially accumulates in mitochondria according to the trans-mitochondrial potential although DHR can be oxidized in different compartments throughout the cell. Measurement of rhodamine fluorescence at the excitation/emission wavelengths of 500 nm/536 nm provides reasonable quantification of the overall cellular oxidant production. DHR was prepared as a 25 mm stock solution in nitrogen-purged dimethyl formamide and kept stored in the dark at −20 °C. For each experiment, stock DHR was diluted fresh with dimethyl formamide and added to cells at a final concentration of 5 μm. Cells were then exposed to TBH for 30 min, washed twice with PBS, harvested into 2 ml of PBS, and sonicated (Braun-Sonic sonicator, Braun Biotech International, Allentown, PA). Rhodamine 123 accumulation was quantified using a luminescence spectrophotometer (AMINCO Bowman Series 2, Thermo Spectronic, Rochester, NY), at excitation and emission wavelengths of 500 and 536 nm, respectively. Results are expressed as relative fluorescence units/mg of protein. Mitochondrial oxidant production was assessed using the mitochondria-specific ROS-sensitive fluorescence probe, Mito Tracker Red. PC-12 cells stably transfected with pRetro-Off vector control or Mn-SOD were grown on coverslips and treated with 100 μmTBH for 0–45 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated for 15 min with 50 nm Mito Tracker Red (CM-H2XROS; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). To verify that mitochondria were the site of ROS formation, co-incubations were performed with 50 nm Mito Tracker Green FM (Molecular Probes), a mitochondria-specific fluorescence probe. Cells loaded with the fluorescence probes were imaged using a Nikon E600 fluorescence microscope, with ×40/1.0 numerical aperture oil or ×60/1.4 numerical aperture oil objectives and excitation/emission wavelength pairs of 490 nm/516 nm and 581 nm/644 nm, for Mito Tracker Green and Mito Tracker Red, respectively. Illumination was provided by a 50-watt X-Cite metal-halide source (EFOS, Inc., Mississauga, Canada), which gave constant illumination intensity across the microscope field. All images were captured using a SynSys digital camera (Photometrics, Tuscon, AZ) at equal exposure time (500 ms) as determined from the fluorescent emission from untreated pRetro-Off control cells. For the overlaid images, the exposures were made at the same plane of focus for both excitation wavelengths at equal times. These images were computer graphically overlaid and analyzed using MetaMorph Software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). The human Mn-SOD cDNA was isolated from pBluescript following NotI and SalI digestion and ligated into the NotI and SalI sites of pBI. This resulting vector was digested with NotI and XmnI to remove a fragment of DNA containing the Mn-SOD cDNA ligated to the SV40 polyadenylation signal. pRetro-Off was digested withBamHI and treated with Klenow to produce blunt end termini. After further digestion of pRetro-Off with NotI, the Mn-SODNotI-XmnI fragment was ligated into pRetro-Off. The human CuZn-SOD was isolated from pBluescript followingBamHI digestion and ligated into the BamHI site of pRetro-Off. The orientation of the cDNAs of Mn-SOD and CuZn-SOD in pRetro-Off was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. Transfection of expression vectors was performed by electroporation. The transfection efficiency of PC-12 cells was initially tested by electroporating pGreenlantern (Invitrogen), a plasmid that expresses the green fluorescent protein, into cells using voltages of 150–350 V. After 24–48 h, transfection efficiency was assessed by the percentage of cells expressing green fluorescent protein by flow cytometry. At 200 V, the transfection efficiency was typically 35–40%. Test (Mn-SOD-pRetro-Off or CuZn-SOD-pRetro-Off) or control (pRetro-Off) vectors (10 μg) were mixed in 200 μl of sterile PBS and used to suspend 5 × 106 cells. Cell and DNA mixtures were subjected to 200 V at a capacitance of 960 microfarads. The cells were resuspended in growth media and allowed to grow for 2–3 days. After replating at a population density of 5 × 103/cm2, cells were grown in puromycin (1.5 nmol/ml) to select for the cells that have integrated the plasmid DNA into their genome. For generation of stable Mn-SOD- or CuZn-SOD-overexpressing cell lines, cells were medium changed every 2 days until single colonies formed. The colonies were isolated and individually expanded to form the respective cell lines. Genomic DNA was prepared from cells using the Qiamp DNA blood minikit (Qiagen) and tested for the presence of vector DNA incorporation in the genome using PCR. As previously described, total SOD activity (cytoplasmic CuZn-SOD and mitochondrial Mn-SOD) was determined by the ability of cell-free extracts to inhibit the oxidation of cytochrome c by xanthine oxidase in the absence of cyanide (21Grisham M.B. MacDermott R.P. Deitch E.A. Inflammation. 1990; 14: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The oxidation of cytochrome c was measured by a change in the absorbance at 550 nm. Mn-SOD activity was determined in the presence of cyanide to inhibit CuZn-SOD activity. CuZn-SOD activity was calculated as the difference between the total SOD activity and that of Mn-SOD. Results are expressed as units/mg protein. Protein was measured using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons or using Student'st test. p values of <0.05 were considered as statistically significant. For our studies, we have generated three clones of pRetro-Off as well as three clones of Mn-SOD-overexpressing and two clones of CuZn-SOD-overexpressing cells. The results of a complete set of studies using one clone from each of pRetro-Off, Mn-SOD, and CuZn-SOD are presented. Initial experiments show that the other respective clones behaved similar to one another and gave reproducible results in response to TBH. Fig. 1 summarizes the results on the effect of TBH on cellular production of ROS and cell apoptosis in undifferentiated wild type PC-12 cells. Fig. 1A shows that treatment of cells with 100 μm TBH caused a 3-fold increase in rhodamine fluorescence at 30 min, consistent with an early generation of ROS. This TBH-induced DHR oxidation was eliminated by pretreatment of cells with the thiol antioxidant, NAC. The production of ROS caused by TBH elicited ∼37% cell apoptosis at 24 h, which was completely prevented by NAC pretreatment (Fig.1B). Notably, the addition of NAC at 1 h after TBH exposure and at a time after ROS increase did not confer cytoprotection against TBH challenge (Fig. 1B). Collectively, these results are consistent with the suggestions that ROS are a mediator of TBH-induced PC-12 apoptosis and that the initiating signaling occurred within the first 30 min after cells were treated with TBH. To determine the intracellular source of ROS production, we generated PC-12 clones that overexpress the human mitochondrial Mn-SOD or the human cytoplasmic CuZn-SOD cDNAs. The insertion of Mn-SOD and CuZn-SOD pRetro-Off mammalian expression vectors into the genome of PC-12 cells was confirmed by PCR (data not shown). The extent of Mn-SOD and CuZn-SOD overexpression was quantified by the respective enzyme activities of the SOD isoforms. The data in Fig. 2A show that transfection with Mn-SOD resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in cellular Mn-SOD enzyme activity, whereas transfection with CuZn-SOD resulted in a 2-fold elevation in CuZn-SOD activity as compared with the respective SOD activities in wild type PC-12 cells and pRetro-Off vector controls. Differential fractionation of cell extracts confirmed that the transfected Mn-SOD and CuZn-SOD proteins were localized to the respective mitochondrial and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig.2B). In each instance, the endogenous enzyme activity of the other SOD isoform was unaffected by the transfections, indicating that the overexpression of either Mn-SOD or CuZn-SOD did not cause a compensatory up- or down-regulation of the other isoform. The results on the effect of TBH on apoptosis of wild-type PC-12 cells and PC-12 clones that stably overexpress Mn-SOD or CuZn-SOD are summarized in Fig. 3. TBH induced ∼32% apoptosis in cells transfected with the pRetro-Off vector, a value that was similar to wild type (35%), indicating that the introduction of the vector per se did not influence the effect of TBH. Notably, Mn-SOD-overexpressing cells (hereafter termed Mn-SOD-S cells) were significantly protected from TBH-induced apoptosis, whereas apoptosis was exacerbated in CuZn-SOD-overexpressing cells (hereafter termed CuZn-SOD-S cells). These results suggest that the differential effects of TBH on apoptosis of PC-12 cells overexpressing Mn-SOD or CuZn-SOD were associated with the increases in the respective enzymes in these cells. The base-line expression of CPP32 in pRetro-Off vector control and Mn-SOD-S cells (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively) was low, in agreement with wild type PC-12 cells (22Pias E.K. Aw T.Y. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1007-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,23Pias E.K. Aw T.Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast, base-line procaspase-3 expression was elevated in CuZn-SOD-S cells (Fig. 4C). TBH treatment caused an increase in CPP32 levels in Mn-SOD-S cells at 30 min followed by a decrease at 6 h (Fig. 4B), similar to pRetro-Off control (Fig.4A) and wild type PC-12 cells (22Pias E.K. Aw T.Y. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1007-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In CuZn-SOD-S cells, TBH challenge resulted in a marked decrease in procaspase-3 levels at 30 min, consistent with a rapid cleavage of CPP32 to active caspase-3. The time course of caspase-3 activation directly correlated with the cleavage of its target substrate, PARP, from a native 116-kDa protein to an 85-kDa product. Significant cleavage of PARP occurred at 6 h in pRetro-Off and Mn-SOD-S cells (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively) and 30 min in CuZn-SOD-S cells (Fig.4C). Fig. 5 shows that TBH caused 4-fold increases in ROS production in wild type PC-12 and pRetro-Off vector controls, indicating that introduction of a plasmidper se did not promote ROS formation. Mn-SOD overexpression attenuated DHR oxidation, consistent with a role for mitochondrial derived ROS in PC-12 apoptosis caused by TBH. Interestingly, CuZn-SOD overexpression was without effect on TBH-induced cellular ROS production, consistent with a minor contribution of cytosolic ROS to cell apoptosis. Two additional strategies were used to confirm that mitochondrial derived oxidants were responsible for PC-12 cell apoptosis induced by TBH. First, we pretreated pRetro-Off control cells with known inhibitors of mitochondrial sites of ROS production, namely, rotenone, an inhibitor of Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase), and antimycin A, an inhibitor of Complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex). The results (Fig. 6) show that rotenone as well as antimycin A treatment significantly attenuated TBH-induced apoptosis, indicating that blockade of electron flux at Complex I and Complex III can effectively prevent the apoptotic outcome, in agreement with previous observations (22Pias E.K. Aw T.Y. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1007-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Second, the mitochondrial source of oxidant production was directly assessed using Mito Tracker Red, a mitochondria-specific ROS sensitive fluorescence probe, and verified with Mito Tracker Green co-incubation. In untreated cells, mitochondria predominantly exhibited green fluorescence, consistent with low ROS generation (Fig. 7, A and E). TBH challenge in pRetro-Off control cells caused rapid and time-dependent increases in red fluorescence relative to green (15–45 min; Fig. 7, B–D), consistent with enhanced ROS production. In contrast, red fluorescence was not detectable at 15 min and minimally increased at 30 min in TBH-treated Mn-SOD-S cells (Fig. 7, F and G), indicating attenuated and kinetically delayed ROS formation. Consistent with this suggestion, the extent of Mito Tracker Red fluorescence at 45 min in Mn-SOD-S cells (Fig. 7H) was similar to control cells at 15 min after oxidant exposure (Fig. 7B). Parallel cell incubations of pRetro-Off controls and Mn-SOD-S cells with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein acetate, a cytoplasmic specific ROS probe, gave no detectable fluorescence at all time points (data not shown), indicating a lack of ROS generation in the cytoplasm. Taken together, these results demonstrate that mitochondrial ROS production is a critical early step in TBH-induced apoptotic signaling in PC-12 cells.Figure 7Time course of TBH-induced mitochondrial ROS production in pRetro-Off vector controls and in cells with stable Mn-SOD overexpression. PC-12 clones were grown on cover slips and treated with 100 μm TBH for varying times. Cells were incubated with Mito Tracker Red and co-stained with Mito Tracker Green (see “Experimental Procedures”). The fluorescence images represent overlaid images of the two fluorescence probes.

https://openalex.org/W2091271908,"Tip60 (Tat-interactive protein, 60 kDa), a cellular protein with intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, is involved in DNA damage repair and apoptosis. Recent studies have suggested that Tip60 acts either as a co-activator or a co-repressor to modulate transcription. In this study, we demonstrate that Tip60 represses reporter gene expression when it is fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. We also show that Tip60 associates with histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) through its N-terminal zinc finger-containing region and that HDAC7 activity is required for the repressive effect of Tip60. Because endogenous Tip60 interacts with STAT3, we hypothesized that Tip60 might complex with STAT3 and HDAC7 and modulate STAT3-mediated trans-activation. Consistent with this hypothesis, the overexpression of Tip60 represses STAT3-driven reporter gene expression, which can be further potentiated by the co-transfection of HDAC7. Furthermore, interleukin-9-induced c-myc expression, which depends on STAT3 activity, is abrogated by exogenous expression of Tip60. This is the first demonstration of which Tip60 represses STAT3 activity in part through the recruitment of HDAC7."
https://openalex.org/W2027096929,"Exposure of cells to mitogens or growth factors stimulates Raf-1 activity through a complex mechanism that involves binding to active Ras, phosphorylation on multiple residues, and protein-protein interactions. Recently it was shown that the amino terminus of Raf-1 contains an autoregulatory domain that can inhibit its activity in Xenopus oocytes. In the present work we show that expression of the Raf-1 autoinhibitory domain blocks extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 activation by the Raf-1 catalytic domain in mammalian cells. We also show that phosphorylation of Raf-1 on serine 338 by PAK1 and tyrosines 340 and 341 by Src relieves autoinhibition and that this occurs through a specific decrease in the binding of the Raf-1 regulatory domain to its catalytic domain. In addition, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of threonine 491 and serine 494, two phosphorylation sites in the catalytic domain that are required for Raf-1 activation, is unlikely to regulate autoinhibition. These results demonstrate that the autoinhibitory domain of Raf-1 is functional in mammalian cells and that its interaction with the Raf-1 catalytic domain is regulated by phosphorylation of serine 338 and tyrosines 340 and 341.

Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Google Scholar, 2Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Google Scholar, 3Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers G.T. Xu B.E.

The activities of ERKs 1 and 2 are regulated through the activation of a sequentially acting protein kinase cascade, known generically as a mitogen-activated protein kinase module. At the top of this cascade is the serine/threonine protein kinase Raf-1. Once activated, Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates the mitogen and extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEKs 1 and 2), which subsequently phosphorylate and activate ERKs 1 and 2. ERKs then phosphorylate a large number of nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates that ultimately regulate the ability of a cell to grow and divide (2Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Google Scholar). The Raf-1 activation mechanism is a complex process that involves binding to the small GTP binding protein Ras, phosphorylation on multiple residues, altered protein-protein interactions, and perhaps direct interaction with lipids (5Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Google Scholar, 6Hagemann C. Rapp U.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 34-46Google Scholar, 7Dhillon A.S. Kolch W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 3-9Google Scholar). Binding to active Ras relocalizes Raf-1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. This interaction is initially mediated by a conserved domain in the Raf-1 amino terminus known as the Ras binding domain (RBD). Binding of Ras to the RBD then promotes contact with an adjacent domain known as the cysteine-rich domain (CRD), and binding of Ras to both of these domains is required for full activation of Raf-1 (5Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Google Scholar). Interaction between Ras and Raf-1 also stimulates the release of 14–3-3 from its amino-terminal binding site, which is centered on serine 259, and the subsequent dephosphorylation of this site (8Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M. Mischak H. Kolch W. Baccarini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22300-22304Google Scholar, 9Jaumot M. Hancock J.F.

This is thought to contribute to the separation of the catalytic domain from the amino-terminal regulatory domain. Activation of Raf-1 by Ras is also accompanied by phosphorylation on multiple residues, including serines 338 and 339 and tyrosines 340 and 341. Phosphorylation of these sites is essential for Raf-1 activation by extracellular ligands such as epidermal growth factor, phorbol esters, and integrin binding (11Barnard D. Diaz B. Clawson D. Marshall M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1539-1547Google Scholar, 12Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Google Scholar, 13Chaudhary A.

Kinases that may catalyze the phosphorylation of these sites in the cell are the p21-activated kinases (PAKs) 1–3, which phosphorylate serines 338 and 339 (13Chaudhary A. King W.G.

Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Google Scholar), and the Src family of tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylate tyrosines 340 and 341 (15Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Google Scholar, 16Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Google Scholar). In addition, Raf-1 activation may require phosphorylation on two conserved sites within the activation loop of its kinase domain (threonine 491 and serine 494) (17Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Google Scholar). Kinases that phosphorylate these residues have not been identified. Despite the clear importance of phosphorylation of Raf-1 on each of these sites, it is not yet understood how these events contribute to Raf-1 activation. Previously it was shown (18Cutler Jr., R.E. Stephens R.M. Saracino M.R. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9214-9219Google Scholar) that the amino terminus of Raf-1 contains an autoinhibitory domain that can block the function of the Raf-1 catalytic domain in Xenopus oocytes. This supports a model in which the catalytic activity of inactive Raf-1 is inhibited by interaction with the autoinhibitory domain. The mechanism whereby the catalytic domain is released from the autoinhibitory domain has not been determined. In this report we show that the autoinhibitory domain of Raf-1 can block the ability of a separately expressed Raf-1 catalytic domain to stimulate ERK2 activity in mammalian cells. We also show that this domain minimally consists of the first 147 amino acids of Raf-1 and encompasses portions of both the RBD and the CRD. We also demonstrate that phosphorylation of Raf-1 on serine 338 and tyrosines 340 and 341 relieves this autoinhibitory effect and that this occurs through a reduction in the affinity of the amino terminus for the phosphorylated catalytic domain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that putative phosphorylation sites within the kinase loop (threonine 491 and serine 494) are not likely to regulate autoinhibition. These data demonstrate that phosphorylation of Raf-1 on serines 338 and 339 and tyrosines 340 and 341 contributes to Raf-1 activation by blocking the ability of the autoinhibitory domain to regulate Raf-1 catalytic activity. Hemagglutinin epitope-tagged ERK2, Raf BXB (amino acids 1–25 and 304–648), and constitutively active PAK1 (PAK1 L107F) were as previously described (19Frost J.A. Xu S. Hutchison M.R. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Google Scholar, 20Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. Stippec S. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28191-28198Google Scholar). Constitutively active chicken Src (21Fumagalli S. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 871-874Google Scholar) was subcloned into pCMV5. Point mutations in pCMV5/Raf BXB plasmids were produced by PCR and sequenced to confirm correct amplification. Raf-1 1–330, 1–330 C165/168S, 1–256, 1–186, 1–147, 51–131, and 139–186 were produced by PCR and cloned into pCMVFlag6B (Sigma). Recombinant baculovirus expressing hexahistidine-tagged RafCAT (amino acids 304–648) was produced using the plasmid pFastBacHTb, essentially as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). GST·Raf-1 1–330 protein was produced in BL21DE3 Escherichia coli. Specifically, cells were grown to A 600 = 0.8 at 37 °C and induced with 400 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were frozen and subsequently lysed by sonication in 10 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. GST·Raf-1 1–330 was purified from the soluble lysate by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose. Specifically, 2 ml of a 50% slurry of pre-swelled glutathione-agarose was added to the soluble lysate and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Bound GST·Raf-1 1–330 protein was precipitated by centrifugation, and the slurry was washed three times with lysis buffer. The beads were then resuspended in an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline and stored at 4 °C. Hexahistidine-tagged RafCAT protein was produced in Sf9 cells grown in Sf-900 II SFM (Invitrogen) by infection with a recombinant baculovirus for 48 h. Cells were pelleted at 500 ×g and stored at −80 °C. Cell pellets were lysed by homogenization in hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation. Triton X-100 was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 0.5%, and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. RafCAT protein was purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography using a 10-250 mm imidazole gradient, essentially as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (all cell culture reagents from Invitrogen). Cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (19Frost J.A. Xu S. Hutchison M.R. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Google Scholar). For all assays when shown, 2 μg of HA-tagged ERK2 and 20 ng of Raf BXB plasmids were transfected. The amounts transfected for other constructs were as noted in the corresponding figure legends. Twenty hours after transfection, the culture medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum, and the cells were incubated for a further 24 h. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of Triton lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 80 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the soluble supernatant was stored at −80 °C. Immunoprecipitation-kinase assays measuring hemagglutinin epitope-tagged ERK2 activity were performed as previously described (19Frost J.A. Xu S. Hutchison M.R. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Google Scholar). Briefly, HA-ERK2 was immunoprecipitated from soluble cell lysates using 2 μg of mouse anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 40 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and once with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The kinase activity of immunoprecipitated HA-ERK2 was assayed using 10 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma) as a substrate. Incubations were for 30 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ32P]ATP (ICN Biomedicals)). Phosphorylated MBP was resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. After drying, the gel was exposed to autoradiography film, and the phosphorylation of MBP was quantitated by scintillation counting of the excised MBP. RafCAT protein (1 μg) was phosphorylated or not by incubation in kinase buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C with or without recombinant GST·PAK1 (22Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Google Scholar) or recombinant Src (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). It was previously determined that after 30 min the phosphorylation of RafCAT by either kinase had reached a maximum. After phosphorylation, one-tenth of the phosphorylated RafCAT (100 ng) was mixed with 10 μg of GST·Raf-1 1–330 bound to glutathione-agarose, and phosphate-buffered saline was added to a final volume of 300 μl. Proteins were mixed for 1 h at 4 °C. Glutathione-agarose-protein complexes were then pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was saved to test for the presence of unbound RafCAT protein. The pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Pelleted complexes were solubilized with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Bound and unbound proteins were loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were then performed for RafCAT (rabbit anti-Raf-1, C-12, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-serine 338 (rat anti-Raf-1 phospho-serine 338, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), and phospho-tyrosine (mouse anti-phospho-tyrosine 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Western blots were quantitated by densitometry. Cutler et al. (18Cutler Jr., R.E. Stephens R.M. Saracino M.R. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9214-9219Google Scholar) reported that expression of the Raf-1 amino terminus (amino acids 1–330) in Xenopusoocytes blocked both germinal vesicle breakdown and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation stimulated by coexpression of the Raf-1 catalytic domain. To test whether the Raf-1 amino terminus could function as an autoinhibitory domain in mammalian cells, we tested its ability to block ERK2 activation stimulated by expression of the Raf-1 catalytic domain. HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with hemagglutinin epitope-tagged ERK2 (HA-ERK2) and a constitutively active Raf-1 catalytic domain construct (Raf BXB, amino acids 1–25 and 304–648) (19Frost J.A. Xu S. Hutchison M.R. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Google Scholar), either with or without increasing amounts of the Raf-1 amino terminus (1–330). After starving the cells for 24 h, the cells were lysed, and the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated HA-ERK2 was assayed using MBP as a substrate (19Frost J.A. Xu S. Hutchison M.R. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, expression of Raf BXB potently stimulated ERK2 activity in these cells (compare lanes 1 and2). However, ERK2 activation by Raf BXB was effectively blocked by coexpression of increasing amounts of Raf-1 1–330 (lanes 3–5). Thus, the amino terminus of Raf-1 can inhibit the activity of the Raf-1 catalytic domain in mammalian cells. Because the first 330 amino acids of Raf-1 contain several conserved domains, we next examined which regions of the Raf-1 amino terminus were required for autoinhibition. Conserved sequences present in the amino terminus include the CR1 domain, which contains the RBD, (amino acids 51–131), the CRD, (amino acids 139–186), and the CR2 domain (amino acids 255–268) (Fig.2 A) (5Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Google Scholar). Thus, we tested different amino-terminal constructs for their ability to inhibit HA-ERK2 activation stimulated by coexpression of Raf BXB. In these experiments, similar amounts of each amino-terminal protein were expressed, as judged by Western blot using an antibody that recognizes an N-terminal FLAG epitope present in each protein (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 B, coexpression of Raf-1 1–330 blocked ERK2 activation by Raf BXB in a dose-dependent manner. Deletions within the carboxyl-terminal end of the regulatory domain did not affect autoinhibition, because Raf-1 1–256, 1–186, and 1–147 were as effective as 1–330 at inhibiting ERK2 activation. However, expression of the isolated RBD of Raf-1 (55–131) did not block ERK2 activation, demonstrating that the RBD alone cannot mediate autoinhibition. Similarly, the isolated CRD (amino acids 139–186) was also relatively inefficient at blocking ERK2 activation by Raf BXB. Interestingly, mutation of cysteines 165 and 168 to serine, which disrupts the zinc finger and blocks the function of the autoinhibitory domain inXenopus oocytes (18Cutler Jr., R.E. Stephens R.M. Saracino M.R. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9214-9219Google Scholar), only slightly affected the inhibition of ERK2 activation by the Raf-1 autoinhibitory domain in these cells (Fig. 2 B, Raf-1 1–330 CC/SS). We interpret these data to indicate that the autoinhibitory domain is minimally encompassed by residues 1–147 but also includes sequences within the CRD amino-terminal to residue 147. Furthermore, an intact zinc finger appears not to be required for autoinhibition, because expression of the CC/SS mutant still blocked ERK2 activation. Because mutation of these cysteines also blocks the ability of the CRD to bind Ras, 14-3-3, and phosphatidylserine (5Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Google Scholar, 6Hagemann C. Rapp U.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 34-46Google Scholar, 23Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Google Scholar, 24Hekman M. Hamm H. Villar A.V. Bader B. Kuhlmann J. Nickel J. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24090-24102Google Scholar), it appears that interaction with these molecules is not required for autoinhibition in mammalian cells. Raf-1 is phosphorylated on serines 338 and 339 and tyrosines 340 and 341 in response to extracellular stimuli (15Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Google Scholar, 16Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Google Scholar, 25Diaz B. Barnard D. Filson A. MacDonald S. King A. Marshall M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4509-4516Google Scholar). Among these residues, serine 338 and tyrosine 341 appear to be the major phospho-acceptor sites because their phosphorylation is critical for Raf-1 activation (12Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Google Scholar, 25Diaz B. Barnard D. Filson A. MacDonald S. King A. Marshall M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4509-4516Google Scholar). However, the role that phosphorylation of these sites plays in the Raf-1 activation mechanism is unknown. It has previously been shown that mutation of tyrosine 340 to aspartic acid, which is thought to mimic the phosphorylation of this site, attenuates the autoinhibitory activity of the Raf-1 amino terminus inXenopus oocytes (18Cutler Jr., R.E. Stephens R.M. Saracino M.R. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9214-9219Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether phosphorylation of serine 338 and tyrosine 341 blocks autoinhibition by the Raf-1 amino terminus in mammalian cells. HEK 293 cells were transfected with Raf BXB, with or without Raf-1 1–330, and the activation of epitope-tagged ERK2 was measured. To stimulate the phosphorylation of serine 338 and tyrosine 341, the cells were also transfected with increasing amounts of constitutively active PAK1 or constitutively active Src, respectively. As shown in Fig.3 A, expression of constitutively active forms of either PAK1 (PAK1*,lanes 5–7) or Src (Src*, lanes 8–10) blocked the autoinhibitory effect of Raf-1 1–330 on ERK2 activation in a dose-dependent manner. This was accompanied by phosphorylation of Raf-1 on serine 338 (PAK1 transfectants) or tyrosines 340 and 341 (Src transfectants), as determined by Western blotting with antibodies specific for phospho-serine 338 and phospho-tyrosine (data not shown). The results of three independent experiments are quantified in Fig. 3 B. Thus, these data indicate that phosphorylation of serine 338 by PAK1, and tyrosines 340 and 341 by Src, block the ability of the autoinhibitory domain to function. To determine whether expression of active PAK1 or active Src relieved autoinhibition through a mechanism other than phosphorylation of Raf BXB, we examined whether substitution of the PAK or Src phosphorylation sites with non-phosphorylatable residues (S338A or Y340/341F, respectively) affected the ability of active PAK1 or Src to block autoinhibition. As shown in Fig.4 A, expression of active PAK1 or active Src effectively relieved autoinhibition of wild type Raf BXB by the Raf-1 amino terminus (lanes 3–6). However, expression of active PAK1 only marginally rescued ERK2 activation in cells expressing Raf BXB S338A (S/A), whereas coexpression of active Src still blocked autoinhibition (lanes 7–10). The modest rescue of autoinhibition by active PAK1 in cells expressing Raf BXB S338A may be due to a low level of phosphorylation of serine 339 or an increased efficiency of coupling between Raf and MEK1 caused by the phosphorylation of MEK1 by PAK1 (22Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Google Scholar, 26Eblen S.T. Slack J.K. Weber M.J. Catling A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6023-6033Google Scholar, 27Coles L.C. Shaw P.E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2236-2244Google Scholar). On the other hand, expression of active Src did not relieve autoinhibition in cells expressing Raf BXB Y340/341F, whereas active PAK1 was fully able to block autoinhibition (lanes 11–14). Fig. 4 Brepresents the mean of four independent experiments. Thus, these results indicate that expression of active PAK1 or active Src blocks Raf-1 autoinhibition through the direct phosphorylation of serine 338 and tyrosines 340/341, respectively. Based on homology between B-Raf and Raf-1, Chong et al. (17Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Google Scholar) identified threonine 491 and serine 494 as potential phosphorylation sites that are required for Raf-1 activation. These sites are contained within the activation loop of the Raf-1 kinase domain, and phosphorylation of the corresponding residues in B-Raf is required for its activation (28Zhang B.H. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5429-5439Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether these sites are involved in the Raf-1 autoinhibition mechanism. We first substituted these sites with alanine (TS/AA), which precludes their phosphorylation in the cell. As shown in Fig.5 A, this largely blocked the ability of Raf BXB to stimulate ERK2 activity (lane 7). This was most likely due to a reduction in Raf BXB kinase activity, because these sites were shown to be required for the kinase activity of full-length Raf-1 (17Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Google Scholar). However, some ERK2 activation was still apparent, and this was effectively blocked by coexpression of Raf-1 1–330 (lane 8). In addition, autoinhibition of this Raf BXB mutant was counteracted by coexpression of active PAK1 or active Src (lanes 9 and 10). Thus, mutation of threonine 491 and serine 494 to nonphosphorylatable residues does not affect the autoinhibition mechanism. To mimic the phosphorylation of these sites, we replaced them with acidic residues (TS/ED) (17Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Google Scholar). Expression of this Raf BXB mutant stimulated ERK2 activity to a greater degree than the TS/AA mutant (compare lanes 7 and 11). However, this Raf BXB mutant was still subject to autoinhibition by the Raf-1 amino terminus (lane 12). This suggests that phosphorylation of these sites is not required for relief of autoinhibition. Furthermore, autoinhibition of Raf BXB TS/ED was effectively blocked by coexpression of active PAK1 or active Src (lanes 13 and 14). Fig. 5 B represents the mean of seven independent experiments. Thus, these results demonstrate that phosphorylation of threonine 491 and serine 494 is not required to block autoinhibition and indicate that phosphorylation of these sites is required for other steps within the Raf-1 activation mechanism. Using purified proteins, we next examined whether phosphorylation of the Raf-1 catalytic domain by PAK1 or Src affected the ability of the autoinhibitory domain to bind to the catalytic domain. For these experiments, Raf-1 1–330 was expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein, and the Raf-1 catalytic domain (RafCAT, residues 304–648) was expressed as an hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein in insect cells (it is insoluble in bacteria). To measure the binding of these proteins, an excess of GST·Raf-1 1–330 was incubated with RafCAT, and the binding was allowed to proceed to equilibrium. GST·Raf-1 1–330 was then precipitated using glutathione-agarose, and the amount of RafCAT bound was examined by Western blotting using an antibody specific for the RafCAT protein. The amount of RafCAT protein still present in the supernatant was also measured. Under these conditions, ∼10% of the RafCAT protein did not bind to Raf-1 1–330 (Fig. 6). Furthermore, coprecipitation of RafCAT with the Raf-1 amino terminus required the presence of Raf-1 1–330 because RafCAT did not coprecipitate with glutathione beads bound to glutathione S-transferase alone (data not shown). However, when RafCAT was phosphorylated with Src prior to incubation with Raf-1 1–330, the amount of free RafCAT increased to ∼30%. The reduction in binding was even more apparent if one measured only the tyrosine-phosphorylated RafCAT population (40% unbound). Similar results were observed when RafCAT was phosphorylated by recombinant PAK1 prior to incubation with the Raf-1 amino terminus. Thus, these data indicate that phosphorylation of Raf-1 on serine 338 or tyrosines 340/341 reduces the affinity of the autoinhibitory domain for the catalytic domain. Raf-1 activation by growth factors is a complex process that entails recruitment to the plasma membrane by active Ras and the subsequent phosphorylation of Raf-1 on multiple sites. The role of phosphorylation within this mechanism has remained unclear. Previous work has shown that Raf-1 contains an autoinhibitory domain within the first 330 amino acids of its amino terminus (18Cutler Jr., R.E. Stephens R.M. Saracino M.R. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9214-9219Google Scholar). This was demonstrated by measuring the ability of the Raf-1 amino terminus to inhibit meiotic maturation in Xenopus oocytes stimulated by expression of the Raf-1 catalytic domain. It was also shown that regulation of autoinhibition did not correlate with changes in 14–3-3 binding to the Raf-1 amino terminus and that it depended on the integrity of the CRD. In the present study we have shown that the Raf-1 autoinhibitory domain can block the ability of the Raf-1 catalytic domain to stimulate ERK2 activity in mammalian cells. Furthermore, this domain minimally consists of the first 147 amino acids of Raf-1, although sequences within the CRD carboxyl-terminal to residue 147 may contribute to autoregulation. We also show that phosphorylation of Raf-1 on serine 338 and tyrosines 340 and 341 blocks autoinhibition and that this is due to a reduction in the affinity of the autoinhibitory domain for the phosphorylated, catalytic domain. Thus, these results indicate that phosphorylation of Raf-1 on these sites is required for activation because this modification blocks autoinhibition. Through extensive deletion analysis we have more precisely defined the region encompassing the autoinhibitory domain. This domain includes sequences within the RBD (amino acids 51–131) and the CRD (amino acids 139–186) but does not include the CR2 domain of Raf-1 (amino acids 255–268). A coincidence of autoinhibitory and small G protein binding domains exists in other kinases. For example, PAK1 contains an autoinhibitory domain that partially coincides with its Rac/Cdc42 binding domain (20Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. Stippec S. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28191-28198Google Scholar, 29Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Google Scholar). In addition, the interaction of the PAK1 autoinhibitory domain with the catalytic domain is regulated by phosphorylation (30Chong C. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17347-17353Google Scholar, 31Buchwald G. Hostinova E. Rudolph M.G. Kraemer A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Scheffzek K. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5179-5189Google Scholar). Interestingly, in contrast to the results of Cutler et al.(18Cutler Jr., R.E. Stephens R.M. Saracino M.R. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9214-9219Google Scholar), we found that an intact zinc finger within the CRD domain was not required for autoinhibition. This is based on our definition of the minimal autoinhibitory domain (residues 1–147), which does not include the zinc finger region, and the finding that disruption of the zinc finger by mutation of two key cysteine residues to serine (C165/186S) only slightly affected autoregulation by the Raf-1 amino terminus (Fig. 2 B). One possible explanation for these conflicting results is the divergent systems used to assay autoinhibition (maturation of Xenopus oocytesversus ERK2 activation in HEK 293 cells). In oocyte maturation, for example, a requirement for the CRD in autoinhibition may reflect a role in other aspects of Raf-1 signaling that are not directly related to mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Previous work also suggested that phosphorylation of Raf-1 on tyrosine 340 may block autoregulation. This was proposed because expression of RafCAT containing a phosphorylation mimic at Y340 (Y340D) precluded inhibition of meiotic maturation by the Raf-1 regulatory domain (18Cutler Jr., R.E. Stephens R.M. Saracino M.R. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9214-9219Google Scholar). In addition, it was recently published that phosphorylation of residues between serine 338 and tyrosine 341 was necessary for high affinity interaction between Raf-1 and MEK1 (32Xiang X. Zang M. Waelde C.A. Wen R. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44996-45003Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with the idea that phosphorylation of serine 338 and/or tyrosine 340 is required to block autoinhibition. We cannot, however, preclude a role for the phosphorylation of these sites in regulating the affinity of Raf-1 for MEK1. In fact, it is possible that phosphorylation of serine 338 and tyrosine 340 serves a dual role in stimulating the activity of Raf-1 toward MEK1, namely to block autoinhibition and to increase interaction between Raf-1 and MEK1. We have also found that phosphorylation of threonine 491 and serine 494 is not likely to be involved in the regulation of autoinhibition, because substitution of these sites with acidic residues, which mimics their phosphorylation, does not affect autoinhibition. These sites are located within the activation loop of the Raf-1 kinase domain, and in many kinases phosphorylation of sites within the activation loop directly affects catalytic activity (33Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Google Scholar, 34Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Google Scholar). Thus, given our data, we would predict that phosphorylation of threonine 491 and serine 494 is necessary for an increase in Raf-1 catalytic activity rather than a relief of autoinhibition. In conclusion, our data detail a role for phosphorylation of Raf-1 on serine 338 and tyrosines 340 and 341 in the Raf-1 activation mechanism. Specifically, phosphorylation of these sites prevents interaction between the autoinhibitory and catalytic domains. Given this data, we can refine a common model for growth factor-mediated Raf-1 activation (5Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Google Scholar, 17Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Google Scholar). In this model, inactive Raf-1 is recruited to the plasma membrane by GTP-bound Ras. Ras first binds to the RBD of Raf-1 and then interacts with the CRD. Binding of Ras to these domains causes 14–3-3 to release from its amino-terminal binding site (serine 259), thereby allowing Raf-1 to further unfold. Dephosphorylation of serine 259 may also occur at this time. Raf-1 is then phosphorylated on serine 338 and tyrosines 340 and 341 by kinases whose activities are also regulated by Ras. Phosphorylation of these sites locks Raf-1 in an open conformation by preventing interaction between the catalytic and autoinhibitory domains. However, full activation of Raf-1 would not occur until it is phosphorylated on threonine 491 and serine 494 by one or more as yet unidentified kinases. Once Raf-1 is phosphorylated on all four sites it is fully active and able to phosphorylate its downstream target MEK. Refinement of this model remains an area for further study. We thank Jeff Rosen for the active Src cDNA, Huajun Qin for excellent technical assistance, and Robert Kirken for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2092799988,"Signaling pathways in response to DNA double strand breaks involve molecular cascades consisting of sensors, transducers, and effector proteins that activate cell cycle checkpoints and recruit repair machinery proteins. NFBD1 (a nuclearfactor with BRCT domains protein 1) contains FHA (forkhead–associated), BRCT (breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 carboxylterminus) domains, and internal repeats and is an early participant in nuclear foci in response to IR. To elucidate its role in the response pathways, small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against NFDB1 in human cells demonstrated that its absence is associated with increased radio-sensitivity and delayed G2/M transition, but not G1 to S. NFBD1 associates with nuclear foci within minutes following IR, a property similar to histone H2AX, 53BP1, and Chk2, which are all early participants in the DNA damage signaling cascade. Temporal studies show that H2AX is required for the foci positive for NFBD1, but NFBD1 is not needed for 53BP1- and H2AX-positive foci. NFBD1, together with 53BP1, plays a partially redundant role in regulating phosphorylation of the downstream effector protein, Chk2, since abrogation of both diminishes phosphorylated Chk2 in IR-induced foci.

Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Nature. 2001; 411: 969-974Google Scholar). Proximal kinases (ATM, possibly ATR and DNA-PK), in cooperation with adaptor proteins, activate a variety of substrates, such as transducer kinases and effectors (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2002; 408: 433-439Google Scholar, 3Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Google Scholar). In yeast, Rad9 is an adaptor protein that plays a central role in transducing and amplifying DNA damage signals by recruiting transducer kinase Rad53 to DNA sites of double strand breaks (7Sun Z.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Google Scholar) and early participation in DNA damage responses, three BRCT domain-containing proteins, 53BP1, BRCA1, and NFBD1 (11Schultz L.B. Chehab N.H. Malikzay A.

Recent functional studies indicating that 53BP1 only partially regulates the G2/M checkpoint and Chk2, the human homologue of scRad53, suggests that additional players participate in this crucial cellular response to DNA damage (15Wang B. Matsuoka S. Carpenter P.B. Elledge S.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1435-1438Google Scholar, 16Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Celeste A. Ward I. Romanienko P.J. Morales J.C. Naka K. Xia Z.

Bartek J. Halazonetis T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 998-1002Google Scholar). Our initial work on NFBD1 showed that it forms IR-induced foci (IRIF) within 2 min after exposure. Expression of NFBD1-derived BRCT domains compromised association of both Thr68-phosphorylated Chk2 (Chk2T68P) and γ-H2AX within IRIF (13Shang Y.L. Bodero A.J. Chen P.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6323-6329Google Scholar). These data suggest the involvement of NFBD1 in early cellular responses to DNA damage. In the present study, we investigate the precise role of NFBD1 in DNA damage response signaling pathway by using RNAi to suppress NFBD1 protein levels and found that its absence is associated with increased radio-sensitivity and delayed G2/M transition, but not G1 to S. NFBD1, together with 53BP1, plays a partially redundant role in regulating phosphorylation of the downstream effector protein, Chk2. These studies place NFBD1 parallel to 53BP1 in regulating Chk2 and downstream of H2AX in the recruitment of repair and signaling proteins to sites of DNA damage. The RNAi vector BS/U6 was kindly provided by Y. Shi (Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School). Nucleotides sequences from 959 to 981 (GGGCTCAGCCTTTTGGCTTCAT) of NFBD1, sequence from 767 to 789 (GGGCCTTCCGGATGGCCGGCGG) of H2AX, or sequence from 1949 to 1971 (GGGTCTGAGGTGGAAGAAATCC) of 53BP1 were used for construction of the RNAi vectors, BS/U6:NFBD1, BS/U6:H2AX, and BS/U6:53BP1, respectively. The RNAi expression cassette of NFBD1 was also inserted into an pCDNA3 vector that directs expression of GFP and was named pGFP/U6:NFBD1. Mouse and rabbit anti-NFBD1 were generated as described previously (13Shang Y.L. Bodero A.J. Chen P.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6323-6329Google Scholar). Mouse anti-53BP1 was generated against COOH-terminal 412 amino acids using standard procedures. Rabbit α-γ-H2AX was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and rabbit α-Chk2T68P was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit anti-NBS1 and anti-Chk2 antisera were purchased from GeneTex (San Antonio, TX). Immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunostaining were performed as described previously (13Shang Y.L. Bodero A.J. Chen P.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6323-6329Google Scholar, 18Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J.Z.D.S. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5287-5292Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence images were captured using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Axiplan2). MCF7, a human breast carcinoma cell line, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 10% CO2. Cells grown in log-phase were irradiated in a 137Cs radiation source (Mark I, model 68A Irradiator, JL Shepherd & Associates, CA). The medium was replaced immediately after irradiation. All the cells were then cultured at 37 °C and harvested at the indicated time points. MCF7 cells transfected and selected with RNAi vectors or empty vector were counted and plated into 10 cm plates. After cell attachment (14 h), the cultures were treated with irradiation at the indicated doses or mock-treated (0 Gy) and then incubated for 14 days. After colony formation, cells were fixed and stained with 2% methyl blue in 50% ethanol. Colony formation was determined by counting a colony with >50 cells. Averages and S.D. values were determined from triplicates. Treated sample percentages were determined by dividing their plating efficiency by the appropriate mock-control. Cells were plated on cover glasses in 35-mm plates. After 24 h, cultures were either mock-treated or irradiated with 12 Gy of IR and then returned to the incubator. After 24-h incubation, fresh medium containing 10 mm BrdUrd was added and cultured an additional 3 h. Cells were then washed once with PBS and fixed for BrdUrd immunostaining using a cell proliferation kit (AmershamBiosciences). BrdUrd-positive cells were scored by fluorescence microscopy and expressed as a fraction of the total cells. Cells were plated on cover glasses in 35-mm plates. After 24 h, cultures were either mock-treated or irradiated with 2–12 Gy of γ-radiation and then returned to the incubator. After 1–4 h, cells were gently washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and then stained with DAPI. Mitotic cells in prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase were identified by fluorescence microscopy, scored, and expressed as a fraction of the total cells. Our initial work on NFBD1 (nuclear factor that contains BRCT domains 1, KIAA0170) showed that it forms IRIF within 2 min after exposure. Expression of NFBD1-derived BRCT domains compromised association of both Thr68-phosphorylated Chk2 (Chk2T68) and γ-H2AX within IRIF (13Shang Y.L. Bodero A.J. Chen P.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6323-6329Google Scholar). NFBD1 phosphorylation in response to ionizing IR is mediated by ATM (14Xu X. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8795-8803Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest the involvement of NFBD1 in early cellular responses to DNA damage. To investigate the precise role of NFBD1 in DNA damage response signaling pathway, we generated a vector-based RNAi construct (19Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Google Scholar) for the in vivo expression of a 22-base pair RNA duplex that targets NFBD1. The human breast cancer cell line, MCF7, transfected with the NFBD1 siRNA construct demonstrated significantly reduced expression of NFBD1 protein about 50–60 h after transfection (Fig.1 B, compare lane 1with lanes 3 and 4). In a population of G418-selected cells expressing siRNA, NFBD1 was nearly undetectable (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 6), indicating effective repression by this approach. Using a GFP/NFBD1 siRNA dual expression plasmid, it is apparent that NFBD1 immunofluorescence is inversely correlated with GFP fluorescence, which is not observed using control vectors (Fig. 1 B, compare rows labeledRNAi, RNAi/Neo R, andRNAi/Neo R/RNAi with vector). Inactivation of genes essential for DNA damage signal transduction, including ATM, H2AX, BRCA1, Chk2 and p53, results in IR sensitivity (see review in Ref. 20Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Science. 2002; 297: 537-551Google Scholar). Because NFBD1 is an early participant in this pathway (13Shang Y.L. Bodero A.J. Chen P.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6323-6329Google Scholar), we then examined IR sensitivity in MCF7 cells expressing NFBD1 siRNA. As shown in Fig. 1 C, NFBD1 RNAi-transfected cells, but not empty vector, formed significantly less colonies upon IR exposure. Similar results were also observed in human HeLa and osteosarcoma U2OS cells (data not shown). To test for the possibility that IR sensitivity results from defects in checkpoint control, NFBD1 RNAi-transfected MCF7 cells were tested for G1/S or G2/M checkpoint control. In both temporal and dose-response protocols (Fig. 1, D and E, respectively), NFBD1 RNAi-transfected MCF7 cells are partially defective in G2/M checkpoint, while the G1/S checkpoint remains intact (Fig.1 F). Previous studies showed that the DNA damage response factors, γ-H2AX, RAD51, 53BP1, and CHK2 form IRIF at sites of DSB (Review in 20). The kinetics of recruitment to DSB sites is useful in exploring their functional relationship. As high dose IR treatment may mask the kinetics of early IRIF formation as reported previously (13Shang Y.L. Bodero A.J. Chen P.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6323-6329Google Scholar), cells were irradiated with 1 Gy, and IR-induced nuclear foci were scored. Similar to γ-H2AX and 53BP1, the percentage of cells with NFBD1-positive IRIF increased immediately after IR treatment and diminished quickly after 60 min (Fig.2 A), implying that these proteins have nearly identical kinetics of foci association and participate at the early stages of DSB response. In contrast, CHK2T68-positive IRIF peaked within 30 min after IR, remained at high levels for 6 h, after which they slowly diminished (Fig.2 A), suggesting that phosphorylation of Chk2T68 and/or its association with IRIF is a later event compared with that of NFBD1, 53BP1, or γ-H2AX. RAD51- and BRCA1-positive foci were detected at a much later stage under conditions of low dose IR exposure (Fig.2 A). To determine the relationship of NFBD1, 53BP1, and γ-H2AX in early responses to DSB, cells transfected with plasmids directing expression H2AX, NFBD1, or 53BP1 siRNA were scored for IRIFs positive for each protein. In the H2AX RNAi-transfected cells, NFBD1, similar to 53BP1 (16Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Celeste A. Ward I. Romanienko P.J. Morales J.C. Naka K. Xia Z. Camerini-Otero R.D. Motoyama N. Carpenter P.B. Bonner W.M. Chen J. Nussenzweig A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 993-997Google Scholar), was not detected at IRIF (Fig. 2 C). In the 53BP1 RNAi-transfected cells, the presence of NFBD1 in IRIF was unchanged (Fig. 2 E). Conversely, in NFBD1 RNAi-treated cells, IRIFs positive for 53BP1 and γ-H2AX was not altered (Fig. 2,B and D). These results suggest that H2AX is upstream and is required for the recruitment of NFBD1 and 53BP1 into the DSB signal transduction cascade. However, association of NFBD1 and 53BP1 with DSB may represent two independent events downstream of H2AX. The function of NFBD1 may serve as an adaptor protein similar to the part played by yeast Rad9 for Rad53, the human homologue of Chk2. To directly test whether NFBD1 has a role in regulating Chk2, phosphorylation of Thr68 in cells transfected with NFBD1 RNAi was assayed by Western blotting using phosphorylation state-dependent antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the immunoreactivity detected with these antibodies was partially reduced relative to total Chk2 protein. These data are comparable with the partial reduction of Chk2T28 phosphorylation observed in 53BP1 RNAi-transfected cells (15Wang B. Matsuoka S. Carpenter P.B. Elledge S.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1435-1438Google Scholar, 16Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Celeste A. Ward I. Romanienko P.J. Morales J.C. Naka K. Xia Z. Camerini-Otero R.D. Motoyama N. Carpenter P.B.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 998-1002Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of 53BP1 could efficiently bring down Chk2 (15Wang B. Matsuoka S. Carpenter P.B. Elledge S.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1435-1438Google Scholar). This observation suggested that 53BP1 might act as an adaptor that facilitates Chk2 phosphorylation. Similarly, Chk2 can be reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated with NFBD1 (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, these results suggest that NFBD1 binds to Chk2 and mediates its phosphorylation. To delineate the signaling pathway leading to Chk2 phosphorylation, Chk2T68-positive IRIF in cells transfected with H2AX, 53BP1, and NFBD1 RNAi expression plasmids were scored. A consistent observation is that H2AX is essential for Chk2T68 association IRIF. However, in 53BP1 or NFBD1 RNAi-treated cells, Chk2T68-positive foci were only partially reduced (Fig. 4, A andB). Interestingly, in 53BP1 and NFBD1 RNAi double transfected cells, CHK2T68-positive IRIF was reduced to a level comparable with H2AX RNAi-transfected cells (Fig. 4, A andB). These results suggest that NFBD1 and 53BP1 redundantly regulate the participation of the phosphorylated Chk2T28 in IR-induced foci. In response to DSBs, NFBD1 and 53BP1 both appear to play a central role in transducing DNA damage signals to downstream effectors by serving perhaps as adaptor proteins connecting the upstream signal from γ-H2AX to the downstream effector Chk2 (Fig. 4 C). This model is consistent with the role of Rad9 function in budding yeast. In yeast, Rad9 is an adaptor protein that plays a central role in transducing and amplifying DNA damage signals by recruiting transducer kinase Rad53 to DNA sites of double strand breaks (7Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Google Scholar, 8Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Google Scholar). Chk2 is a major target of ATM, which phosphorylates threonine 68 to activate its kinase activity in response to DNA damage. Activated Chk2, in turn, phosphorylates p53 at Ser20, CDC25A at Ser123, and CDC25C at Ser216, contributing to the G1/S, S, and G2/M checkpoint (see review in Ref. 21Bartek J. Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Google Scholar). The critical question of how adaptor proteins help mediate activation of Chk2 at DSB sites remains to be solved. Our results showing redundancy of NFBD1 and 53BP1 in regulating the recruitment of Chk2T68 to DNA DSB sites probably underscores the importance of this step in mammalian cells. Because of the dissimilarity of their structures (9Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 266-268Google Scholar, 10Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Google Scholar), it is anticipated that NFBD1 and 53BP1 may also function in different branching pathway. We are grateful to Stanley Fields for providing partial 53BP1 cDNA and Shi Yang for providing pBS/U6 construct. We thank Paula Garza and Diane Jones for antibody preparation and Dave Sharp and Wen-Hwa Lee for critically reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2076750433,"In contrast to the classical nuclear receptors, the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is transcriptionally active in the absence of ligand. In the course of searching for the mediator of CAR activation, we found that ligand-independent activation of CAR was achieved in cooperation with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). PGC-1β, a PGC-1α homologue, also activated CAR to less of an extent than PGC-1α. Coexpression of the ligand-binding domain of a heterodimerization partner, retinoid X receptor α, enhanced the PGC-1α-mediated activation of CAR, although it had a weak effect on the basal activity of CAR in the absence of PGC-1α. Both the N-terminal region, with the L<i>XX</i>LL motif, and the C-terminal region, with a serine/arginine-rich domain (RS domain), in PGC-1α were required for full activation of CAR. Pull-down experiments using recombinant proteins revealed that CAR directly interacted with both the L<i>XX</i>LL motif and the RS domain. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the RS domain of PGC-1α was required for CAR localization at nuclear speckles. These results indicate that PGC-1α mediates the ligand-independent activation of CAR by means of subnuclear targeting through the RS domain of PGC-1α."
https://openalex.org/W2080062782,"The armadillo protein SmgGDS promotes guanine nucleotide exchange by small GTPases containing a C-terminal polybasic region (PBR), such as Rac1 and RhoA. Because the PBR resembles a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence, we investigated the nuclear transport of SmgGDS with Rac1 or RhoA. We show that the Rac1 PBR has significant NLS activity when it is fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) or in the context of full-length Rac1. In contrast, the RhoA PBR has very poor NLS activity when it is fused to GFP or in the context of full-length RhoA. The nuclear accumulation of both Rac1 and SmgGDS is enhanced by Rac1 activation and diminished by mutation of the Rac1 PBR. Conversely, SmgGDS nuclear accumulation is diminished by interactions with RhoA. An SmgGDS nuclear export signal sequence that we identified promotes SmgGDS nuclear export. These results suggest that SmgGDS· Rac1 complexes accumulate in the nucleus because the Rac1 PBR has NLS activity and because Rac1 supplies the appropriate GTP-dependent signal. In contrast, SmgGDS·RhoA complexes accumulate in the cytoplasm because the RhoA PBR does not have NLS activity. This model may be applicable to other armadillo proteins in addition to SmgGDS, because we demonstrate that activated Rac1 and RhoA also provide stimulatory and inhibitory signals, respectively, for the nuclear accumulation of p120 catenin.

The NLS sequence is believed to anchor within the long surface groove formed by the multiple ARM repeats of karyopherin α, promoting the nuclear import of both the NLS-containing protein and karyopherin α (3Chook Y.M.

SmgGDS promotes guanine nucleotide exchange by small GTPases containing a C-terminal polybasic region (PBR), which is a series of adjacent lysines or arginines (11Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Yamamoto T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34901-34908Google Scholar). We noticed a striking sequence similarity between the PBR of small GTPases that interact with SmgGDS and the NLS sequence of proteins that associate with the ARM protein karyopherin α. It is possible that the 11 ARM repeats of SmgGDS form a surface groove that binds the PBR of small GTPases, just as the 10 ARM repeats of karyopherin α form a groove that binds the NLS sequences of different proteins (3Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Google Scholar). Based on this possibility, we hypothesized that the PBR of small GTPases acts as an NLS, promoting the association of these GTPases with SmgGDS and the nuclear accumulation of the SmgGDS·GTPase complex. We tested this hypothesis by examining the nuclear accumulation of transiently transfected SmgGDS in cells co-transfected with mutant or wild-type Rac1 or RhoA. We show that the nuclear accumulation of SmgGDS is enhanced by interactions with Rac1 but diminished by interactions with RhoA. The PBR of Rac1, but not RhoA, was found to have NLS activity. These findings support a model in which the ability of the Rac1 PBR to act as an NLS promotes the nuclear accumulation of SmgGDS·Rac1 complexes. Conversely, the inability of the RhoA PBR to act as an NLS promotes the cytoplasmic accumulation of SmgGDS·RhoA complexes. This model may be applicable to other ARM proteins in addition to SmgGDS, because we demonstrate that the nuclear accumulation of endogenous p120ctn is similarly enhanced by Rac1 but not by RhoA. These findings identify a new function of Rac1 and RhoA and define a novel mechanism for the nuclear accumulation of SmgGDS and potentially other ARM proteins. The majority of the cDNA constructs coding for hemagglutinin (HA)- or myc-tagged proteins that were generated for this study have been deposited in the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center (available at www.cDNA.org), which provides these and other cDNAs to the research community as a non-profit service. Three mammalian expression vectors were used to subclone cDNAs coding for wild-type or mutant SmgGDS, Rac1, or RhoA in this study. The myc-pcDNA3.1 vector was made by inserting cDNA coding for two copies of the myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL), which is recognized by the 9E10 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The HA-pcDNA3.1 vector, which contains cDNA coding for three copies of the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) that is recognized by HA antibody (Covance, Berkeley, CA), was a generous gift of the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center. The pEGFP-C1 vector was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The pEFBOSp120-3AB and pEFBOSp120-3A plasmids, coding for the 3AB and 3A isoforms of p120ctn, respectively (6van Hengel J. Vanhoenacker P. Staes K. van Roy F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7980-7985Google Scholar), were generously provided by Dr. Frans van Roy (University of Ghent) and were used without modification. The pSRα-smg GDS plasmid (19Fujioka H. Kaibuchi K. Kishi K. Yamamoto T. Kawamura M. Sakoda T. Mizuno T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 926-930Google Scholar), which was generously provided by Dr. Yoshimi Takai, Osaka University Medical School, was used as the original source of the full-length SmgGDS coding sequence (SmgGDS isoform 2, NCBI Protein Data base accession number AAA21876). Site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA constructs was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). As depicted below in Fig. 1a, we generated cDNAs coding for wild-type SmgGDS (Sg) or mutant SmgGDS containing alanine substitutions in the N-terminal NES sequence (SgNA2 or SgNA4), the C-terminal NES sequence (SgCA2 or SgCA4), or in both the N-terminal and C-terminal NES sequences (SgNA4CA4). These cDNAs were inserted into the HA-pcDNA3.1 vector to generate constructs coding for proteins with an N terminus 3× HA tag. Alternatively, the cDNAs were inserted into the myc-pcDNA3.1 vector to generate constructs coding for proteins with an N terminus 2× myc tag. As depicted below in Fig. 2a, the pEGFP-C1 vector was used to generate constructs coding for green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the N terminus of the following aa sequences: PPPVKKRKRK to generate the GFP-PBR(Rac1) construct, PPPVKKRKRKCLLL to generate the GFP-PBR(Rac1)CAAX construct, QARRGKKKSG to generate the GFP-PBR(RhoA) construct, and QARRGKKKSGCLVL to generate the GFP-PBR(RhoA)CAAX construct. To facilitate expression, a codon for methionine was inserted at the C terminus of the GFP coding sequence in the pEGFP-C1 vector, immediately preceding the cDNA insert. We obtained from the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center the HA-pcDNA3.1 vector containing cDNA inserts coding for wild-type Rac1 (Rac1), constitutively active Rac1 containing a valine substitution at aa 12 (CA-Rac1), or dominant negative Rac1 containing an asparagine substitution at aa 17 (DN-Rac1). We replaced the six basic aa comprising the Rac1 PBR in these cDNAs with glutamine to yield the Rac1(PBRQ), CA-Rac1(PBRQ), and DN-Rac1(PBRQ) cDNAs, as depicted below in Fig. 3a. We also obtained the HA-pcDNA3.1 vector containing cDNA inserts coding for wild-type RhoA (RhoA), constitutively active RhoA containing a valine substitution at aa 14 (CA-RhoA), and dominant negative RhoA containing an asparagine substitution at aa 19 (DN-RhoA) from the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center. The five basic aa comprising the RhoA PBR in these constructs were replaced with glutamine to yield the RhoA(PBRQ), CA-RhoA(PBRQ), and DN-RhoA(PBRQ) cDNAs, as depicted below in Fig.3d. The cDNA inserts were placed into the pEGFP-C1 vector to generate constructs coding for proteins with an N terminus GFP tag. Alternatively, the cDNAs were inserted in the HA-pcDNA3.1 vector to generate constructs coding for proteins with an N terminus 3× HA tag. The CHO-m3 cell line, which was used for all of the experiments in this study, is a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor.

In the absence of agonist for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which is the case in this study, the CHO-m3 cells do not exhibit any detectable differences from parental CHO cells (20Shafer S.H. Puhl H. Phelps S.H. Williams C.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 148-159Google Scholar, 21Strassheim D. May L. Varker K. Puhl H. Phelps S. Porter R. Aronstam R. Noti J. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18675-18685Google Scholar). The cells were transfected by suspension in Ham's F-12 medium (6 × 106 cells/200 ॖl of medium) containing 8 ॖg of the indicated cDNA, and electroporation by a single electric pulse (200 V, 50 ms) using a BTX Electro Square Porator (Genetronics, Inc., San Diego, CA). The electroporated cells were transferred to tissue culture plates and incubated for 16–24 h (37 °C, 57 CO2) in complete CHO medium consisting of Ham's F-12 medium, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (57), glutamine (0.3 ॖg/ml), penicillin (20 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (20 ॖg/ml). The cells were then used in the indicated assays or plated onto glass coverslips in complete CHO medium (2 × 104 cells/ml medium) and incubated for an additional 16–24 h (37 °C, 57 CO2) before being examined for the intracellular localization of the indicated proteins. Cells expressing GFP-tagged proteins were examined by fluorescence microscopy while the cells were still alive. To co-localize GFP-tagged proteins with HA-tagged proteins or with endogenous p120ctn, the cells were fixed with 37 formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (15 min, 4 °C) and incubated with 50 mm ammonium chloride in PBS to quench formaldehyde fluorescence (10 min, 25 °C). The fixed cells were permeabilized with acetone (10 s, 4 °C) or with 0.27 Triton X-100 (TX-100) in PBS (10 min, 25 °C), as described previously (15Strassheim D. Porter R.A. Phelps S.H. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6699-6702Google Scholar, 22Ruiz-Velasco R. Lanning C.C. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33081-33091Google Scholar). After incubating with PBS containing 17 bovine serum albumin (30 min, 25 °C), the cells were incubated with mouse antibody to HA (Covance) or to p120ctn (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA) (1 h, 25 °C), followed by incubation with TRITC-anti-mouse IgG (1 h, 25 °C). The cells were mounted in PBS containing 907 glycerol and 0.17 p-phenylenediamine and examined using a Nikon Optiphot fluorescence microscope, as previously described (22Ruiz-Velasco R. Lanning C.C. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33081-33091Google Scholar). Digital images of the cells were collected using a Kodak DC 290 zoom digital camera and Adobe Photoshop software. In each assay, investigators ranked the nuclear localization of proteins in at least 20 different cells transfected with the same cDNA, the identity of which was unknown to the investigators. The relative amount of a protein that was detectable in the nucleus of each cell was ranked using the following scale: 1 = undetectable or very low nuclear level and high cytoplasmic level; 2 = moderate nuclear level and high cytoplasmic level; 3 = similar nuclear and cytoplasmic levels; 4 = high nuclear level and moderate cytoplasmic level; 5 = high nuclear level and undetectable or very low cytoplasmic level. We found that TX-100 solubilizes some cytosolic proteins, causing the ratio of nuclear protein to cytosolic protein in TX-100-permeabilized cells to sometimes be greater than the value of these ratios in non-permeabilized and acetone-permeabilized cells. This effect of TX-100 becomes apparent when the subcellular distributions of GFP and GFP-tagged proteins in TX-100-permeabilized cells (see Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8) are compared with those in living cells (see Figs. 2b,3b, and 3e). This effect also becomes apparent when the subcellular distributions of HA-Sg and HA-SgNA4 in TX-100-permeabilized cells (see Figs. 6 and 7) are compared with those in acetone-permeabilized cells (see Fig. 1, b andc). Despite this limitation, TX-100 permeabilization was used because it was found to be significantly better then acetone permeabilization in preserving the subcellular distributions of the expressed wild-type or mutant Rac1 and RhoA proteins.Figure 7The nuclear accumulation of SmgGDS is diminished by RhoA. a, CHO-m3 cells were co-transfected with cDNAs coding for HA-Sg (panels 1–7) or HA-SgNA4 (panels 8–14) and the indicated GFP-tagged wild-type or mutant RhoA proteins. Control cells were co-transfected with the pEGFP-C1 vector (panels 1 and 8). The HA-tagged proteins (red) and GFP-tagged proteins (green) were detected by the fluorescence of TRITC-labeled antibodies and GFP, respectively, in the fixed and TX-100-permeabilized cells.

The cells were cultured for an additional 16 h (37 °C, 57 CO2) in the presence or absence of compactin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and then suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 120 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.57 Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ॖmleupeptin, pH 7.4) containing phosphatase inhibitors (15Strassheim D. Porter R.A. Phelps S.H. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6699-6702Google Scholar). The cells were incubated in the lysis buffer for 20 min on ice with periodic vigorous vortexing of the cell suspension, followed by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Nuclear proteins are solubilized by this method, as indicated by our ability to detect nuclear proteins such as RCC1 in Western blots of the lysate supernatants (data not shown). The supernatants from the centrifuged lysates were immunoprecipitated using the 9E10 myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the HA antibody (Covance), or the p120ctn antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories), as previously described (15Strassheim D. Porter R.A. Phelps S.H. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6699-6702Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography as previously described (15Strassheim D. Porter R.A. Phelps S.H. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6699-6702Google Scholar). These assays were performed exactly as described by Strassheim et al. (15Strassheim D. Porter R.A. Phelps S.H. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6699-6702Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after electroporation, the cells were permeabilized by a freeze/thaw cycle, incubated for 10 min (30 °C) with buffer containing 150 nm [35S]GTPγS (1 mCi/mmol), solubilized with detergent, and centrifuged (13,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The resulting supernatants were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody, and the amounts of [35S]GTPγS bound to the immunoprecipitated HA-tagged Rac1 proteins were determined by liquid scintillation counting. The means of the measured values of each treatment group were compared by using Student's ttest. Means were considered to be significantly different from one another if p was <0.05 in the Student's ttest. In all comparisons, original measured values, rather than percentages, were used in the analyses. Because SmgGDS interacts with nuclear proteins (23Shimizu K. Kawabe H. Minami S. Honda T. Takaishi K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34901-34908Google Scholar), we looked for sequences in SmgGDS that might promote nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Although classic NLS sequences are not apparent in SmgGDS, putative NES sequences, consisting of LX(2–3)LXXLXL in which the leucines are sometimes replaced by isoleucines (reviewed in Ref. 6van Hengel J. Vanhoenacker P. Staes K. van Roy F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7980-7985Google Scholar), are present near the N terminus at aa 4–13 (LSDTLKKLKI) and near the C terminus at aa 465–473 (LALIAALEL), as indicated by the underlined aa. We generated cDNA constructs coding for HA-tagged wild-type SmgGDS (HA-Sg) or HA-tagged mutant SmgGDS proteins containing alanine substitutions in the putative N-terminal or C-terminal NES sequences (Fig.1a). Transient expression of these cDNA constructs in CHO-m3 cells indicates that the nuclear accumulation of SmgGDS is significantly increased by disrupting the N-terminal NES sequence (aa 4–13) but not by disrupting the C-terminal NES sequence (aa 465–473) (Fig. 1, b and c). Inactivation of the nuclear export protein exportin 1 by leptomycin B (25Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 96: 9112-9117Google Scholar) dramatically increases the nuclear accumulation of both wild-type SmgGDS and mutant SmgGDS missing the C-terminal NES sequence but only modestly increases the nuclear accumulation of SmgGDS missing the N-terminal NES sequence (Fig. 1, b and c). These results indicate that SmgGDS shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The nuclear export of SmgGDS is dependent on the N-terminal NES sequence and functional exportin 1. We hypothesize that SmgGDS enters the nucleus when it associates with small GTPases containing a PBR that functions as an NLS. The PBR is present in the 10 amino acids immediately preceding the terminal CAAX region in Rac1 (PPPVKKRKRK) and RhoA (QARRGKKKSG), as indicated by the underlined basic aa. cDNA constructs coding for these 10 aa fused to GFP were generated (Fig. 2a) and expressed in CHO-m3 cells (Fig. 2b). GFP accumulates in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of the transfected cells (Fig.2b), probably reflecting the unfacilitated diffusion of GFP (∼27 kDa) through nuclear pores. The nuclear localization of the GFP chimeric protein is increased significantly by the PBR of Rac1 but only modestly by the PBR of RhoA (Fig. 2b). cDNA constructs coding for GFP fused to the last 14 amino acids of each GTPase were also generated, to yield GFP chimeras containing the PBR plus the CAAX sequence of each GTPase (Fig. 2a). Expression of these cDNA constructs in CHO-m3 cells indicates that the isolated PBR of Rac1, but not RhoA, acts as a potent NLS even in the presence of the CAAX sequence (Fig. 2b). To determine whether the PBR acts as an NLS in the context of full-length Rac1 or RhoA, we generated cDNA constructs coding for GFP-tagged wild-type, constitutively active, or dominant negative Rac1 or RhoA proteins containing either a normal or mutant PBR (Fig.3, a and d). Transient transfection of these constructs in CHO-m3 cells indicates that Rac1 nuclear accumulation is enhanced by activation of Rac1, as indicated by the enhanced nuclear accumulation of GFP-CA-Rac1 (Fig. 3,b and c), and diminished by disruption of the PBR, as indicated by the reduced nuclear accumulation of the GFP-tagged Rac1(PBRQ) proteins (Fig. 3, b and c). Thus, Rac1 nuclear accumulation is promoted both by its conversion to the GTP-bound state and by an intact PBR, consistent with the PBR acting as an NLS. The unique intracellular distributions of the wild-type and mutant Rac1 proteins are not changed by replacing the GFP tag with a much smaller 3× HA tag (∼3 kDa) (data not shown). This finding indicates that the PBR enhances Rac1 nuclear accumulation even when Rac1 is presumably small enough to diffuse through nuclear pores. As expected, the GFP-tagged RhoA proteins exhibit much less nuclear accumulation than do the GFP-tagged Rac1 proteins (Fig. 3, eand f), consistent with the inability of the RhoA PBR to act as an NLS. Disruption of the RhoA PBR does not diminish, but instead can actually enhance, the nuclear accumulation of GFP-tagged RhoA proteins (Fig. 3f), providing further evidence that the RhoA PBR does not act as an NLS. It is possible that Rac1(PBRQ) proteins do not accumulate in the nucleus because they are sequestered in the cytoplasm due to abnormal interactions with cytoplasmic proteins. To examine this possibility, HA-tagged wild-type and mutant Rac1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from 35S-labeled cells and examined for co-precipitating proteins (Fig.4a). RhoGDI preferentially co-precipitates with HA-Rac1, whereas IQGAP1· calmodulin complexes preferentially co-precipitate with HA-CA-Rac1 (Fig. 4a,lanes 1 and 3), consistent with our previous findings (22Ruiz-Velasco R. Lanning C.C. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33081-33091Google Scholar). These proteins do not co-precipitate with HA-Rac1(PBRQ) or HA-CA-Rac1(PBRQ) (Fig. 4a, lanes 2 and4), indicating that disruption of the PBR diminishes the interaction of Rac1 with cytoplasmic proteins. The reduced interaction of Rac1(PBRQ) proteins with cytosolic proteins may account for our observations that mutation of the PBR diminishes the ability of CA-Rac1 to localize at membrane ruffles (Fig. 3b) and releases DN-Rac1 from a restricted juxtanuclear localization (Fig.3b). The reduced interaction of Rac1(PBRQ) proteins with cytoplasmic proteins also lessens the possibility that Rac1(PBRQ) proteins remain in the cytoplasm because they are sequestered by cytoplasm"

To date, only mutations inAPOB encoding prematurely truncated apoB have been found in FHBL. We discovered a novel APOB gene mutation, namely R463W, in an extended Christian Lebanese FHBL kindred. Heterozygotes for R463W had the typical FHBL phenotype, whereas homozygotes had barely detectable apoB-100. The effect of the R463W mutation on apoB secretion was examined using transfected McA-RH7777 cells that expressed one of two recombinant human apoBs, namely B48 and B17. In both cases, the mutant proteins (B48RW and B17RW) were retained within the endoplasmic reticulum and were secreted poorly compared with their wild-type counterparts. Pulse-chase analysis showed that secretion efficiencies of B48RW and B17RW were, respectively, 45 and 40% lower than those of the wild-types. Substitution of Arg463 with Ala in apoB-17 (B17RA) decreased secretion efficiency by ∼50%, but substitution with Lys (B17RK) had no effect on secretion, indicating that the positive charge was important. Molecular modeling of apoB predicted that Arg463 was in close proximity to Glu756 and Asp456. Substitution of Glu756 with Gln (B17EQ) had no effect on secretion, but substitution of Asp456 with Asn (B17DN) decreased secretion to the same extent as B17RW. In co-transfection experiments, the mutant B17RW showed increased binding to microsomal triglyceride transfer protein as compared with wild-type B17.

Thus, the naturally occurring R463W mutant reveals a key local domain governing assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. apolipoprotein very low density lipoproteins low density lipoproteins microsomal triglyceride transfer protein familial hypobetalipoproteinemia high density lipoproteins Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium endoplasmic reticulum monoclonal antibody Apolipoprotein (apo)1 B is essential for the formation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, namely very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons (1Chan L.

In humans, the liver secretes full-length apoB-100 containing 4536 amino acids, whereas the intestine secretes apoB-48 consisting of the amino-terminal 48% of apoB-100 (2Young S.G. Circulation. 1990; 82: 1574-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Both forms of apoB are encoded by the APOB gene on chromosome 2, which spans 43 kb and contains 29 exons coding for a 14-kb mRNA (3Blackhart B.D. Ludwig E.M. Pierotti V.R. Caiati L.

Nature. 1986; 323: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). ApoB-48 arises from a unique editing process in which cytosine at nucleotide position 6666 is converted to uracil, thereby generating an in-frame stop codon (5Chen S.H. Habib G. Yang C.Y. Gu Z.W. Lee R. Wang S.A. Silberman S.R. Cai S.J. Deslypere J.P. Rosseneu M. Gotto Jr., A.M. Li W.H. Chan L. Science. 1987; 238: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The rat liver produces both apoB-100 and apoB-48, and both forms can assemble VLDL (6Elovson J. Chatterton J.E. Bell G.T. Schumaker V.N. Reuben M.A. Puppione D.L. Reeve Jr., J.R. Young N.L. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1461-1473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A pentapartite model for apoB-100 on low density lipoproteins (LDL) has been proposed, in which the apoB polypeptide can be divided into five structurally distinct domains, namely NH2-βα1-β1-α2-β2-α3-COOH (7Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1346-1367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the βα1 domain is homologous to lamprey lipovitellin and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) (8Mann C.J. Anderson T.A. Read J. Chester S.A. Harrison G.B. Kochl S. Ritchie P.J. Bradbury P. Hussain F.S. Amey J. Vanloo B. Rosseneu M. Infante R. Hancock J.M. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Mol.

The βα1 domain of human apoB has thus been modeled on the basis of the solved lipovitellin structure, in which 13 β-strands (amino acids 21–263) form a β barrel, followed by a two-layered helical bundle consisting of 17 α-helices (amino acids 294–592).In vitro experiments suggest that the βα1 domain contains multiple MTP binding sites encompassing residues 430–570 (10Hussain M.M.

The interaction between the apoB βα1 domain and MTP appears to be ionic; chemical modification of Lys and Arg residues within LDL or recombinant apoB-18 abolished interactions between apoB and MTP (12Bakillah A. Jamil H. Hussain M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3727-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that interaction of MTP and the βα1 domain of apoB creates a lipid pocket that facilitates lipid recruitment during lipoprotein assembly (9Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1401-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL; MIM 107730), a genetically heterogeneous autosomal co-dominant disorder, is associated with reduced plasma concentrations (<5th percentile for age and sex) of apoB and β-migrating lipoproteins, such as LDL and VLDL (13Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 521-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many nonsense and frameshift mutations in APOB leading to formation of prematurely truncated apoB forms have been reported in FHBL subjects, with predicted sizes ranging from apoB-2 to apoB-89 (13Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 521-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Kane J.P. Havel R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York2001Google Scholar). There is indirect evidence that molecular changes other than truncations with APOB can cause FHBL (15Pulai J. Neuman R.J. Groenewegen A.W. Wu J. Schonfeld G. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1998; 76: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Truncation variants shorter than apoB-31 are undetectable in plasma. Longer truncation variants typically occur at concentrations <5% of the normal allele product. In vivo apoB turnover studies in FHBL subjects with truncated apoB have shown increased fractional catabolic rates (16Parhofer K.G. Barrett P.H.R. Bier D.M. Schonfeld G. J. Clin.

Homozygotes have extremely low plasma LDL cholesterol and apoB-100 concentrations, and clinical presentation may vary from no symptoms to severe gastrointestinal and neurological dysfunction, similar to abetalipoproteinemia (MIM 200100) (21Sharp D. Blinderman L. Combs K.A. Kienzie B. Ricci B. Wager-Smith K. Gil C.M. Turck C.W. Bouma M.-E. Rader D.J. Aggerbeck L.P. Gregg R.E. Gordon D.R. Wetterau J.R.

Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York2001Google Scholar). However, unlike FHBL, abetalipoproteinemia is an autosomal recessive disorder and is caused by defective MTP (21Sharp D. Blinderman L. Combs K.A. Kienzie B. Ricci B. Wager-Smith K. Gil C.M.

Analysis of naturally occurring truncations has been informative in identifying functional domains of apoB. In vivo studies in human FHBL subjects with carboxyl-terminal-truncated apoB variants (22Parhofer K.G. Barrett P.H.R. Aguilar-Salinas C. Schonfeld G. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 844-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitro expression studies of truncated forms of human apoB (23Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M. Young S.G.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14839-14845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown the importance of apoB length as a determinant of VLDL assembly and secretion. However, factors in addition to apoB length are involved, including adequate supply of lipid (26Yao Z. McLeod R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 152-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and important amino acid sequences that reside within the amino-terminal 48% of the apoB-100 molecule (27McLeod R.S. Wang Y. Wang S. Rusiñol A. Links P. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18445-18455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here we report a novel nonsynonymous nontruncating APOB gene mutation, namely R463W found in an extended Christian Lebanese FHBL kindred, in which the mutation appears to impair the secretion of apoB and apoB-containing lipoproteins. The proband (Fig. 1A, subject III:6) was referred to a lipid disorders clinic with marked hypocholesterolemia detected on a routine lipid screening (28Burnett J.R. Proos A.L. Koutts J. Burnett L. Med. J. Aust. 1993; 159: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This kindred was extended from the original eight to a total of 36 members that included two homozygotes, 14 heterozygotes, and 20 unaffected subjects. Blood samples were obtained from each family member after an overnight fast. Blood (10 ml) was collected into a plain tube and a tube containing EDTA (1 mg/ml) to separate serum and plasma, respectively, by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 15 min at 20 °C. The protease inhibitor aprotinin (100 kilounits/ml) was added to plasma. Plasma total cholesterol, direct high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, direct LDL cholesterol, and serum liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (EC2.6.1.2), aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1), and γ-glutamyltransferase (EC 2.3.2.2) were measured enzymatically using Roche Diagnostics GmbH reagents on a Hitachi 917 analyzer. Plasma apoB-100 and apoA-I were measured using Dade Behring Marburg GmbH, Marburg, Germany, reagents on a Behring BN-II nephelometer. Serum α-tocopherol and retinol were determined by reverse-phase, high performance liquid chromatography using a C-18 column. Serum 25-dihydroxy vitamin D was determined using the INCSTAR/ DiaSorin radioimmunoassay (Stillwater, MN). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by a standard Triton X-100 procedure. Genotype analysis of APOE was performed by PCR amplification followed by digestion with the restriction enzyme HhaI as described (29Hixson J.E. Vernier D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 545-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Delipidated plasma samples were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (5% gel) containing 0.1% SDS (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) as described (30McCormick S.P. Fellowes S.P. Walmsley A.P. George P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1138: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The membrane was incubated with mAb 1D1 (a gift of Dr. R. Milne, University of Ottawa Heart Research Institute) that recognizes an epitope of apoB in amino acids 401–582. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood (Puregene, Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The entireAPOB coding region, including the 5′-flanking region, all exons, and at least 100 base pairs of intronic sequence at each intron-exon boundary, were amplified using PCR. Amplification products were run on 1.5% agarose gels and purified using QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.). Purified DNA fragments were directly sequenced in two directions using the amplification primers. Sequences were detected on the 377 Prism DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) and results were analyzed with Sequence Navigator software (Applied Biosystems). All sequence variants were detected on electropheretograms of sequencing reactions, and each was seen in both directions. The R463W mutation was confirmed by using a second, independent amplification of the affected genomic region from the proband and re-sequencing in both directions. Genotype analysis of family members and normolipidemic control subjects was performed by direct sequencing of exon 11 from genomic DNA. The cDNA fragment that encompassed nucleotides 20–6666 of the human apoB cDNA was excised from the plasmid pRc/CMV-B48 (31Hussain M.M. Zhao Y. Kancha R.K. Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) by digestion with NotI and MluI and inserted into pCMV5 expression plasmid (32McLeod R.S. Zhao Y. Selby S.L. Westerlund J. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2852-2862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting pB48wt was used as template to introduce R463W substitution using the QuikChangeTM mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) with mutagenesis primers shown in TableI. To prepare apoB-17 expression plasmids, the cDNA fragment encoding the NH2-terminal 782 amino acids of apoB followed by a stop codon was inserted into pCMV5 to generate pB17wt. The R463W, R463K, R463A, D456N, and E756Q substitutions were introduced by QuikChangeTM mutagenesis with the mutagenesis primers shown in Table I.

Open table in a new tab McA-RH7777 and COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were cultured under conditions as described previously (33Wang S. McLeod R.S. Gordon D.A. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14124-14133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Transfection of McA-RH7777 cells with B48 or B17 expression plasmids was achieved using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (34Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8358-8360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or using the FuGENE 6 Transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient expression of apoB-17 together with human MTP in COS-7 cells was performed as described previously (33Wang S. McLeod R.S. Gordon D.A. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14124-14133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Expression of recombinant apoB and MTP was verified by immunoblotting using mAb 1D1 (32McLeod R.S. Zhao Y. Selby S.L. Westerlund J. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2852-2862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a polyclonal anti-MTP antibody, respectively. The anti-MTP antibody was a gift of Dr. C. Shoulders (Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom). Stably transfected cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 20% serum and 0.4 mm oleate. At the end of labeling, the media were fractioned into VLDL1 (Sf > 100), VLDL2 (Sf 20–100), and other lipoproteins by cumulative rate flotation in a KBr density gradient (35Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The 35S-apoB was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (3–15% gradient gel) as described previously (27McLeod R.S. Wang Y. Wang S. Rusiñol A. Links P. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18445-18455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 1 h in methionine-free DMEM and chased up to 2 h in normal DMEM. Both pulse and chase media contained 20% serum and 0.4 mmoleate. The medium and cell-associated apoB (B48 and B17) or apoA-I were immunoprecipitated at different chase times, and were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. Radioactivity associated with35S-apoB or 35S-apoA-I was quantified by scintillation counting. The recovery of medium and cell35S-apoB or 35S-apoA-I during chase was presented as percent of initial counts that associated with cell apoB or apoA-I at the end of pulse. Indirect double immunofluorescence co-localization studies were performed as described previously (36Tran K. Thorne-Tjomsland G. DeLong C.J. Cui Z. Shan J. Burton L. Jamieson J.C. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31187-31200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) using transiently transfected cells. The mAb 1D1 was used to probe the recombinant human apoB with goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluro 488 conjugate (Molecular Probes, number A-6440) as the secondary antibody. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus were probed with anti-calnexin and anti-α-mannosidase II antibodies, respectively, with Alexa Fluro 594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, number R-6394) as the secondary antibody. The images were captured using the MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad). Subcellular fractionation of intracellular microsomes was performed as described previously (36Tran K. Thorne-Tjomsland G. DeLong C.J. Cui Z. Shan J. Burton L. Jamieson J.C. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31187-31200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In brief, two dishes of cells (100 mm) were homogenized using a ball-bearing homogenizer. Postnuclear supernatant was subjected to fractionation by centrifugation in a Nycodenz gradient (37Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 126: 41-52Google Scholar, 38Rickwood D. Ford T. Graham J. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 123: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, 15 fractions (0.8 ml each) were collected from the top of the tube, and an aliquot of each fraction (50 μl) was resolved by SDS-PAGE (3–15% gradient gel). The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with mAb 1D1, anti-Hsp47 antibody (for ER), anti-α-mannosidase II antibody (for cis/medial Golgi), and anti-TGN38 antibody (for distal Golgi), respectively. On the basis of marker protein localization determined by immunoblotting, fractions 1–3, 4–8, and 9–15 were designated distal Golgi,cis/medial Golgi, and ER, respectively. Polyclonal anti-α-mannosidase II was a gift of Dr. M. G. Farquhar (University of California, San Diego, CA). The mAb recognizing proteins containing the KDEL motif (Hsp47) and the anti-TGN38 antibody were purchased from StressGen and Affinity Bioreagents, respectively. Metabolic labeling of lipid using [3H]glycerol was performed as described (35Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The molecular model of B17 was created using the program MODELLER (39Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10448) Google Scholar). Residues 19–766 of human apoB (40Cladaras C. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Nolte R.T. Atkinson D. Zannis V.I. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3495-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) were aligned with residues 18–758 of lamprey lipovitellin (41Sharrock W.J. Rosenwasser T.A. Gould J. Knott J. Hussey D. Gordon J.I. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with the assistance of the program BLAST (42Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69707) Google Scholar). This alignment, along with the coordinates from the crystal structure of lamprey lipovitellin (43Anderson T.A. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Structure. 1998; 6: 895-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), was then used as input for MODELLER. Five disulfide bonds were constrained between cysteine residues in the apoB sequence during the modeling. The modeling did not include the region corresponding to residues 689–728 of lipovitellin (residues 676–737 of apoB) that is missing from the electron density in the crystal structure. The proband (III:6) and her daughter (IV:15) had a plasma total cholesterol of ∼1 mm, with barely detectable LDL cholesterol and apoB-100. The presence of reduced plasma concentrations of apoB-containing lipoproteins in first-degree relatives confirmed the diagnosis of homozygous FHBL in the proband (Fig. 1A). The individual lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein values for the R463W kindred are shown in Table II. Heterozygotes (n = 14) had mean plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apoB concentrations of 2.60 mm, 0.93 mm, and 0.31 g/liter, respectively. Heterozygotes had a significant mean decrease in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apoB-100 concentrations of 44, 67, and 67%, respectively, as compared with unaffected family members (n = 20). No family member had the apoε2 isoform, ruling out this variant as a possible contributor to hypolipoproteinemia. Despite low lipid and lipoprotein concentrations of the affected subjects, none had any developmental problems, malabsorption, or neurological deficits. When compared with unaffected family members, heterozygotes had significant mean increases in the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyltransferase of 3.8-, 1.6-, and 3.0-fold, respectively (Table III). Consistent with these results, a 2.9-fold increase in serum ferritin was observed. Furthermore, serum ferritin was positively correlated with alanine aminotransferase (r = 0.76;p < 0.001). Serum α–tocopherol concentrations were the lowest in the homozygotes, intermediate in heterozygotes, and the highest in unaffected subjects.

Zimmerman G.A. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 419-445Google Scholar). In addition, PAF has been implicated in the central nervous system (2Bazan N.G. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 118: 281-291Google Scholar, 3Maclennan K.M. Smith P.F. Darlington C.L. Prog. Neurobiol. 1996; 50: 585-596Google Scholar) and the reproductive system (4Levine A.S. Kort H.I.

PAF is hydrolyzed to an inactive metabolite by a specific enzyme called PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). At least three types of PAF-AH exist in mammals, namely the intracellular types I and II (6Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Google Scholar, 7Hattori K. Hattori M.

Le T.H. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Google Scholar). Intracellular type I PAF-AH (PAF-AH (I)) is an oligomeric complex. It contains a dimer of two homologous catalytic subunits, α1 and α2, and a non-catalytic ॆ subunit (6Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Google Scholar, 9Hattori M.

Interestingly, the ॆ subunit was later found to be identical to LIS1, the product of the causative gene for type I lissencephaly (10Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Nature. 1994; 370: 216-218Google Scholar, 12Reiner O. Carrozzo R. Shen Y. Wehnert M. Faustinella F. Dobyns W.B. Caskey C.T. Ledbetter D.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 717-721Google Scholar). Type I lissencephaly is a genetic brain malformation showing a smooth cerebral surface without gyri, caused by abnormal neuronal migration at early developmental stages. Mice homozygous for the Lis1null mutation die early in embryogenesis soon after implantation (13Hirotsune S. Fleck M.W. Gambello M.J. Bix G.J. Chen A. Clark G.D. Ledbetter D.H. McBain C.J. Wynshaw B.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 333-339Google Scholar). Heterozygous and compound heterozygous mice have expression level-dependent defects in neuronal migration (13Hirotsune S. Fleck M.W. Gambello M.J. Bix G.J. Chen A. Clark G.D. Ledbetter D.H. McBain C.J. Wynshaw B.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 333-339Google Scholar). A series of recent studies has suggested that LIS1 interacts not only with PAF-AH (I) catalytic subunits but also with a number of proteins, including tubulin (14Sapir T. Elbaum M. Reiner O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6977-6984Google Scholar), cytoplasmic dynein (15Faulkner N.E. Dujardin D.L. Tai C.Y. Vaughan K.T. O'Connell C.B. Wang Y. Vallee R.B. Nat.

Gambello M.J. Yingling J. Wynshaw B.A. Hirotsune S. Neuron. 2000; 28: 681-696Google Scholar). Through interaction with these proteins, LIS1 plays important roles in microtubule-associated cellular functions such as mitotic cell division, chromosomal segregation, and neuronal migration. In contrast, the biological role of the catalytic subunits of PAF-AH (I) remains a complete enigma. Nothwang et al. (21Nothwang H.G. Kim H.G. Aoki J. Geisterfer M. Kubart S. Wegner R.D. van Moers A. Ashworth L.K. Haaf T. Bell J. Arai H. Tommerup N. Ropers H.H. Wirth J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 797-806Google Scholar) have described a case of functional hemizygosity of α1, possibly responsible for the resulting mental retardation, ataxia, and brain atrophy in this patient. Furthermore, Lecointe et al. (22Lecointe N. Meerabux J. Ebihara M. Hill A. Young B.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2852-2859Google Scholar) have proposed that deregulation of transcription of the human α2 gene is associated with the development of a certain lymphoma. Therefore, the PAF-AH (I) catalytic subunit is also likely to play an important role in some pathological conditions. The α1 and α2 catalytic subunits belong to a novel serine esterase family (9Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23150-23155Google Scholar). These subunits, which show ∼607 amino acid homology with each other, form homodimers and a heterodimer. Ho et al.(23Ho Y.S. Swenson L. Derewenda L.S. Wei Y. Dauter Z. Hattori M. Adachi T. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Derewenda Z.S. Nature. 1997; 385: 89-93Google Scholar) have reported the x-ray crystal structure of the α1 homodimer. The folding is unique among known lipases and phospholipases. The structure unexpectedly resembles those of the G-protein family such as p21ras and Gα. To elucidate the in vivofunction of the catalytic subunits of PAF-AH (I), namely α1 and α2, we generated mice lacking either one or both of these two proteins. α1,α2 genomic clones were isolated from a mouse 129/SvJ genomic library in the Lambda FIXII vector (Stratagene). Targeting vectors were constructed for replacing part of exon 2 and 3 of theα1 and α2 genes, which include a translation initiation site and catalytic motif (GXSXV) with a PGKneobpA cassette (24Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Google Scholar). A PGKDTA (diphtheria toxin Α fragment) cassette was inserted at the 3′-end of the short arm for negative selection. The targeting vectors were linearized and electroporated into ES cell line RW4 (Genome Systems), which was cultured on neomycin-resistant mouse embryonic fibroblasts. G418-resistant colonies were screened for homologous recombinants by PCR. Candidates of homologous recombinants were verified by Southern analysis using fragments at the 3′-ends of the genes, external to the targeting vectors as probes. Chimeric mice were generated by injection of the ES cells into C57BL/6N blastocysts, followed by transfers to foster mothers, and backcrossed to C57BL/6N mice. Genotypes were determined by PCR and/or Southern analysis of the tail DNA samples. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against α1 and α2 were established as follows. α1−/− andα2−/− female mice were immunized with each purified recombinant rat protein with Freund's complete adjuvant (DIFCO), followed by six boosters at 2-week intervals with 20 ॖg of protein and established monoclonal antibody, producing hybridoma cell lines as previously described (11Hattori M. Adachi H. Aoki J. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31345-31352Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody against LIS1 (clone 338, a kind gift from Dr. O. Reiner, Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, Israel) and α-tubulin (clone DM1A, Sigma) were used for a Western blot analysis. Polyclonal antibody against LIS1 (N-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for an immunohistochemical analysis. Testes were dissected and fixed overnight in Bouin's fixative at 4 °C. Paraffin sections (5 ॖm) were prepared and stained with Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) and hematoxylin. For immunohistochemistry, mice under anesthesia were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then with 47 paraformaldehyde in PBS. Testes were dissected and refixed overnight in 47 paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Paraffin sections (5 ॖm) were boiled in a microwave oven in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. Subsequent immunodetection was performed using a Vector M.O.M. immunodetection kit (Vector Laboratories) for α1 and α2 and Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) for LIS1. Immunostaining was visualized using diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin. For detection of apoptotic germ cells, Bouin's-fixed, paraffin-embedded testis sections were subjected to TUNEL staining using an in situ cell death detection kit, POD (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tissues were homogenized in quadruple volumes (w/v) of SET buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose) with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml pepstatin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 10 mmNa3PO4). After centrifugation at 1,000 ×g at 4 °C, the supernatants were used as the total protein lysates. The protein concentrations of samples were determined by the BCA assay (PIERCE). Each total protein lysate (50 ॖg/lane) was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes or nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 57 (w/v) skim milk (Wako) in TTBS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.057 (w/v) Tween 20) and incubated with antibodies in TTBS. Chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences) was used for analyzing levels of protein according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was extracted from mouse tissues using Isogen (Nippongene). Total RNA (10 ॖg/lane) was separated by 17 agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in 20× SSC. The membranes were hybridized in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences) at 65 °C and washed with 0.5× SSC, 0.17 SDS at 65 °C. Probes for α1, α2, and LIS1 were obtained by RT-PCR from mouse RNA and labeled by 32P[dCTP] (Amersham Biosciences) using the Rediprime II DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were stripped and rehybridized with human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (Clontech) to ensure equal loading. We established monoclonal antibodies against α1 and α2 by immunizing the respective knockout mice. A Western blot analysis of adult mouse tissue shows that α1, α2, and LIS1 were most abundantly expressed in brain and testis (Fig. 1). Expression of α2 and LIS1 were observed in other tissues as well, whereas α1 expression was restricted to embryonic brain and adult testis (Fig. 1). The expression levels of α2 and LIS1 were observed to be essentially proportional to that of α-tubulin, a component of microtubules. Because LIS1 plays an important role in microtubule dynamics (14Sapir T. Elbaum M. Reiner O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6977-6984Google Scholar, 16Smith D.S. Niethammer M. Ayala R. Zhou Y. Gambello M.J. Wynshaw B.A. Tsai L.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 767-775Google Scholar), it can be postulated that both α subunits are also involved in this process. Immunohistochemical staining of adult mouse testes revealed that α2 and LIS1 immunoreactivity was present in all seminiferous tubule cell types (Fig. 2, D andG). Intense staining of α2 and LIS1 was observed in meiotically dividing spermatocytes and elongating spermatids. In contrast, α1 staining was restricted to the cells lining the basal compartment of seminiferous tubules (Fig. 2A). Magnification revealed that α1 was specifically localized in spermatogonia cytoplasm (Fig. 2B, arrow), whereas α2 and LIS1 were expressed in the cytoplasm of all types of spermatogenic cells and Sertoli cells (Fig. 2, E and H), suggesting that α1 is involved specifically in proliferation and/or differentiation of spermatogonia. LIS1 was also localized at meiotic spindles of spermatocytes (Fig. 2H, arrowhead) and manchettes of elongating spermatids (Fig. 2H, arrow), both of which are specific microtubule structures. No staining of α1 or α2 was detected in the seminiferous tubules of null mutant mice (Fig.2, C and F). We used homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to generate mice lacking the α1 (Pafah1b3) anda2 (Pafah1b2) genes. Parts of exon 2 and exon 3 of each gene, including the translation initiation site and the catalytic serine residue, were replaced with a neomycin-resistance gene (Fig. 3A). Targeted embryonic stem cell clones and subsequent germ line transmissions were detected by PCR and/or Southern blot analysis (Fig. 3B). Bothα1−/− and α2−/−mice were born with the expected Mendelian frequencies, viable and apparently indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates. Western blot analysis of the brain and the testis homogenates showed no immunoreactive bands in either α1−/− orα2−/− mice (Fig. 6A).α1−/−/α2−/− mice were also viable and apparently indistinguishable from wild-type mice. However,α1−/−/α2−/− males were found to be infertile, whereas female fertility was not affected. Testes weights of 5-week-oldα1−/−/α2−/− mice were significantly (∼357) smaller than those of wild-type mice (Table I). Testes weights were not noticeably reduced in α1−/− mice, whereas they were reduced to 607 in α2−/− mice (Table I). There was no significant difference in body weight among any of the genotypic combinations (Table I).Figure 6LIS1 protein expression is reduced inα2−/− andα1−/−/α2−/− adult mice. A, Western blot analysis of PAF-AH (I) subunits in adult brains and testes of the wild-type mice and various α mutant mice.

Open table in a new tab Comparison of mean (±S.E.) testes and body weight in wild-type and various mutant mice at 5 weeks of age (n = 8). The histology of mutant testes was examined at age 5 weeks, the time when the first wave of murine spermatogenesis is completed. The seminiferous tubules ofα1−/−/α2−/− mice showed a 507 reduction in diameter, and spermatogenic cells were dramatically decreased (Fig.4F) when compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 4A). Spermatocytes beyond the pachytene stage and round spermatids were significantly reduced in number. Elongated spermatids were rare, and the few remaining spermatids had deformed nuclei. Some germ cells appeared to be detached from the Sertoli cells. No spermatozoa were observed in the epididymis (data not shown). In older mice, early germ cell stages were more severely affected, leading to increased depletion of spermatocytes and spermatogonia (data not shown). In TUNEL assays, apoptotic cells were rare in wild-type testes as previously reported (25Mori C. Nakamura N. Dix D.J. Fujioka M. Nakagawa S. Shiota K. Eddy E.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 125-136Google Scholar) (Fig.5A), whereasα1−/−/α2−/−testes had a significantly larger number of apoptotic cells (Fig.5B). The cells undergoing apoptosis inα1−/−/α2−/−testes were predominantly spermatocytes. These results indicate that in the absence of the catalytic subunits of PAF-AH (I), the differentiation of prehaploid stages of spermatogenesis fails, leading to induction of programmed cell death in the germ cell compartment.Figure 5Increased apoptosis in spermatogenic cells ofα1−/−/α2−/−testis. Sections of seminiferous tubules of wild-type (A) andα1−/−/α2−/− mice (B) at 5 weeks of age are shown. Apoptotic cells are labeled by TUNEL staining. Scale bar: 100 ॖmView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Histologically, α1−/− mice testes showed no apparent impairment of spermatogenesis (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, α2−/− mice testes showed significant weight reduction and varying germ cell impairment (Fig.4C and Table I). When comparingα1−/−/α2+/− mice testes withα1+/−/α2−/− mice testes from both the histological and weight points of view, impairment was more severe when both α2 alleles were missing (Fig. 4,D and E, and Table I). These results indicate that α2 plays a more important role in spermatogenesis than α1 and that missing α1 alleles can in part be compensated by the presence of α2. However, it is evident that α1 also plays a role in male fertility based on the observation that the absence of both α2 alleles can be partly compensated by the presence of α1 alleles (Fig.4, C, E, and F, and Table I). The α1 protein level was reduced to about 207 of the normal level inα2−/− mice (Fig. 3C) even though there was no reduction of the mRNA level (data not shown), whereas the α2 level was not changed in α1−/−mice. Because a large portion of LIS1 forms complexes with α1 and/or α2 in the cytosolic fraction, we examined the LIS1 protein levels in α1 and/or α2 mutant adult mice. In α2−/−mice, LIS1 levels in both brain and testis were reduced to ∼307 compared with wild-type mice (Fig.6A). In contrast, no reduction of LIS1 was observed in α1−/− mice (Fig.6A). Inα1−/−/α2−/− mice, as in α2−/− mice, LIS1 levels were reduced to about 207 of the levels in the wild type mice. Lis1mRNA expression in α2−/− mice was either the same as or slightly higher than the expression in wild type mice (Fig. 6B). On the other hand, LIS1 expression in E14.5 (embryonic day 14.5) brain of each mutant mouse was not significantly less than that in wild-type mice (Fig. 6C). In this study, we demonstrated that the catalytic subunits of intracellular PAF-AH (I) are involved in murine spermatogenesis. Our study gives new insights into the in vivo function of PAF-AH (I). We showed by Western blotting that in mice the catalytic subunits α1 and α2 as well as LIS1 are present at high levels in both brain and testis. Interestingly, it was noted that PAF-AH (I) subunits exhibit expression levels proportional to those of α-tubulin, a major component of intracellular microtubules. The above findings and the fact that LIS1 is a microtubule-associated protein lead us to speculate that the catalytic subunits are also involved to a major extent in microtubule dynamics. Microtubule structures undergo dramatic rearrangements in the process of spermatogenesis. Processes involving microtubule rearranging include mitotic division of spermatogonia, meiotic division of spermatocytes, manchette formation, and flagellar axoneme assembly in spermatids. The most severe degeneration occurs in primary spermatocytes ofα1−/−/α2−/− mice, but degeneration also occurs in meiotically dividing spermatocytes (increased apoptosis) and in elongating spermatids (abnormal nuclear morphogenesis). Therefore, it can be stated that PAF-AH (I) catalytic subunits are involved in the several processes of spermatogenesis and not just in a specific stage of spermatogenesis. Although the exact molecular mechanism and function of the PAF-AH (I) catalytic subunits in spermatogenesis are unclear, we found that depletion of both catalytic subunits leads to a major decrease in LIS1 protein levels, suggesting that the catalytic subunits are associated with LIS1. It is most likely that LIS1 protein levels are post-transcriptionally influenced by the catalytic subunits, because LIS1 mRNA levels are not altered inα2−/− mice. Because LIS1 levels are crucial for cortical brain development (13Hirotsune S. Fleck M.W. Gambello M.J. Bix G.J. Chen A. Clark G.D. Ledbetter D.H. McBain C.J. Wynshaw B.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 333-339Google Scholar), we speculate that LIS1 is involved in microtubule organization of spermatogenesis and that reduced LIS1 protein levels are responsible for the testicular defects occurring inα1−/−/α2−/− mice. However, our studies also revealed that the more severe testicular degeneration inα1−/−/α2−/− mice than in α2−/− mice cannot be explained solely by the amount of reduction in the level of LIS1, because the reduction of LIS1 was not very different betweenα2−/− andα1−/−/α2−/− mice. Given that PAF-AH (I) closely resembles trimeric G-proteins (23Ho Y.S. Swenson L. Derewenda L.S. Wei Y. Dauter Z. Hattori M. Adachi T. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Derewenda Z.S. Nature. 1997; 385: 89-93Google Scholar), the catalytic subunits may mediate a novel intracellular signaling to LIS1 in mammals, and depletion of this signaling pathway may result in severe impairment in spermatogenesis. Because PAF-AH (I) catalytic subunits are predominantly expressed in brain as well as in testis and because haplo-insufficiency of LIS1 leads to severe brain malformation in both humans and mice (13Hirotsune S. Fleck M.W. Gambello M.J. Bix G.J. Chen A. Clark G.D. Ledbetter D.H. McBain C.J. Wynshaw B.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 333-339Google Scholar), we expected that mice lacking the catalytic subunits would exhibit brain abnormalities. However, Nissl staining of adultα1−/−/α2−/− mice brain showed no obvious abnormalities in lamination of neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, or cerebellum (data not shown). To our surprise, in E14.5 brain ofα1−/−/α2−/− mice, there was no significant reduction of LIS1 protein levels, suggesting that there is a mechanism to maintain LIS1 protein levels and the function of catalytic subunits in brain. In α2−/− mice, both α1 and LIS1 protein levels were significantly reduced compared with wild-type mice, whereas in α1−/− mice both α2 and LIS1 levels were not changed markedly. In preliminary experiments, supernatants of mice testis or brain homogenates were subjected to DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange column chromatography. In the case of theα1−/− homogenates, α2 eluted in the same fraction as LIS1, whereas in the case of theα2−/− homogenates α1 and LIS1 eluted at the different positions. 2H. Koizumi, N. Yamaguchi, J. Aoki, K. Inoue, and H. Arai, unpublished observations.These results suggest that α2, probably the α2 homodimer, has a strong affinity for LIS1 and that the α1 homodimer has a weak or negligible affinity for LIS1 in vivo. Considering the fact that α1 mRNA levels are not changed inα2−/− mice (data not shown), the present results also suggest that the α1 protein is not stably expressed in the absence of α2 in vivo. These observations are consistent with our previous report (26Manya H. Aoki J. Watanabe M. Adachi T. Asou H. Inoue Y. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18567-18572Google Scholar) that α1/α2 heterodimers and α2 homodimers are the major PAF-AH (I) catalytic units presentin vivo. Immunostaining studies revealed that α2 is expressed in all spermatogenic cells, whereas α1 is expressed only in spermatogonia. This expression pattern parallels the finding that deletion of both subunits induces a marked loss of germ cells, even at an early spermatogenic stage. We have previously shown that α1 is specifically expressed in migrating neurons in the embryonic and postnatal stages, whereas the α2 expression level is almost constant from the fetal stages through adulthood (26Manya H. Aoki J. Watanabe M. Adachi T. Asou H. Inoue Y. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18567-18572Google Scholar, 27Albrecht U. Abu I.R. Ratz B. Hattori M. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Eichele G. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 579-593Google Scholar). As a result, the catalytic subunits change from the α1/α2 heterodimer to the α2/α2 homodimer in neurons during brain development. It is likely that the same type of alteration in the catalytic dimer occurs during differentiation from spermatogonia to spermatocytes. Interestingly, it has been shown that undifferentiated spermatogonia move to specific sites within the seminiferous tubule and spread their progeny laterally along the base of the tubule (28Chiarini G.H. Hornick J.R. Griswold M.D. Russell L.D. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 1179-1185Google Scholar). Transplantation experiments demonstrated that spermatogonia are capable of moving along the length of the seminiferous tubule at a rate of more than 50 ॖm/day (29Nagano M. Avarbock M.R. Brinster R.L. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 1429-1436Google Scholar, 30Parreira G.G. Ogawa T. Avarbock M.R. Franca L.R. Brinster R.L. Russell L.D. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1360-1370Google Scholar). Although the biological significance of the change in the catalytic subunit combination is not known, it is interesting to speculate that α1 mediates a common signaling pathway in migrating neurons and spermatogonia. The cellular function of the enzyme activity and the physiological substrate of this enzyme are largely unknown. PAF has been detected in sperm from several mammalian species and has been shown to affect sperm motility and fertility (4Levine A.S. Kort H.I. Toledo A.A. Roudebush W.E. J. Androl. 2002; 23: 471-476Google Scholar). High-fertility spermatozoa, for example, have a substantially greater PAF content than low-fertility spermatozoa (31Roudebush W.E. Diehl J.R. Theriogenology. 2000; 55: 1633-1638Google Scholar, 32Roudebush W.E. Purnell E.T. Fertil. Steril. 2000; 74: 257-260Google Scholar). Exogenously added PAF increases the motility of human spermatozoa (33Ricker D.D. Minhas B.S. Kumar R. Robertson J.L. Dodson M.G. Fertil. Steril. 1989; 52: 655-658Google Scholar). Our study gives hints at the possibility that PAF is not only involved in spermatozoal maturation and penetration but is also involved in spermatogenesis itself. On the other hand, PAF-AH (I) shows striking substrate specificity for an acetyl group but hydrolyzes other types of acetyl-containing esters in vitro (34Min J.H. Wilder C. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Paul L. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4539-4549Google Scholar). Studies on the tertiary structure of the catalytic dimer suggest that the substrate of this enzyme is not necessarily a lipophilic substance (23Ho Y.S. Swenson L. Derewenda L.S. Wei Y. Dauter Z. Hattori M. Adachi T. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Derewenda Z.S. Nature. 1997; 385: 89-93Google Scholar). Because PAF-AH (I) shows similarities to trimeric G-proteins (23Ho Y.S. Swenson L. Derewenda L.S. Wei Y. Dauter Z. Hattori M. Adachi T. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Derewenda Z.S. Nature. 1997; 385: 89-93Google Scholar), the PAF-AH (I)-mediated novel intracellular signaling is likely operating in mammals, with PAF or a related substance as a GTP-like switch. When measuring cytosolic PAF-AH activity ofα1−/−/α2−/− mice in brain and testis, enzymatic reduction to ∼657 of wild-type mice was seen in both tissues (data not shown). This phenomenon is likely because type I PAF-AH is the only affected subtype, whereas enzymatic activities of type II PAF-AH and further not yet identified PAF-AH subtypes are probably responsible for the remaining activity. In conclusion, we found that the depletion of the PAF-AH (I) catalytic subunits induces reduction of LIS1 protein on the cellular level and severe testicular malformation on the phenotypic level. The next question to be considered is whether the catalytic activity of PAF-AH (I) is required for LIS1 protein stability and spermatogenesis. To answer these questions, we are planning to insert the catalytically inactive α1 and α2 subunit genes into our double-knockout mouse model. We thank O. Reiner for the LIS1 antibody and S. Ishikawa and staff for animal care."

Two forms of this receptor exist; membrane-bound (mICAM-1) and soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1). The soluble receptor may be produced independently from the membrane-bound form or it may be the product of proteolytic cleavage of mICAM-1. The ratio of airway epithelial cell expression of mICAM-1 to the sICAM-1 form may influence cell infectivity and outcome of rhinovirus infection. We therefore investigated the effect of rhinovirus on expression of both ICAM-1 receptors in normal human bronchial epithelial cells. We observed separate distinct messenger RNA transcripts coding for mICAM-1 and sICAM-1 in these cells, which were modulated by virus. Rhinovirus induced mICAM-1 expression on epithelial cells while simultaneously down-regulating sICAM-1 release, with consequent increase in target cell infectivity. The role of protein tyrosine kinases was investigated as a potential mechanistic pathway. Rhinovirus infection induced rapid phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine kinase, which may be critical in up-regulation of mICAM-1.

Bachert C. Vancauwenberge P. Rhinology. 1999; 37: 97-103Google Scholar). Currently, there is no effective treatment for HRV infections; over the counter cold remedies only alleviate the symptoms but do not eradicate the virus. Primarily, HRV target epithelial cells for attachment and entry. These cells express intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), the receptor for 907 of HRV serotypes (2Greve J.M. Davis G. Meyer A.M. Forte C.P. Connolly Yost S. Marlor C.W. Kamarck M.E. McClelland A. Cell. 1989; 56: 839-847Google Scholar). Both this major group of HRV and the 107 of HRV that use alternative receptors for cell attachment enhance cell surface ICAM-1 expression (3Papi A. Johnston S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9707-9720Google Scholar). This glycoprotein, belonging to the immunoglobulin supergene family, consists of five Ig-like domains (4Voraberger G. Schafer R. Stratowa C. J. Immunol. 1999; 147: 2777-2786Google Scholar); domains 1 and 2 have been shown to fit snugly in a key-lock relationship into reciprocal canyons on the HRV shell (5Bella T. Kolatkar P.R. Marlor C.W. Greve J.M. Rossmann M.G. Virus Res. 1999; 62: 107-117Google Scholar). In addition, to this critical role as a docking molecule during HRV infection, ICAM-1 through separate domains with its cognate ligand LFA-1 (CD18/CD11a) drives the migration of immune-effector cells to sites of inflammation (6Bella T. Kolatkar P.R. Marlor C.W. Greve J.M. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4140-4145Google Scholar). While most studies refer to the membranous form of ICAM-1, a soluble form (sICAM-1) has also been described (7Rothlein R. Mainolfi E.A. Czajkowski M. Martin S.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3788-3793Google Scholar). The molecular mass of sICAM-1 is similar to the molecular mass of the extracellular domain of ICAM-1 (80–114 kDa) depending on the level of glycosylation, suggesting that this soluble circulating form of ICAM-1 consists of most of the extracellular domain of membranous ICAM-1 (7Rothlein R. Mainolfi E.A. Czajkowski M. Martin S.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3788-3793Google Scholar). Several circulating isoforms of sICAM-1 have also been detected of 240, 430, and >500 kDa in size, indicating that sICAM-1 may circulate in a complexed form either with itself or with other proteins (7Rothlein R. Mainolfi E.A. Czajkowski M. Martin S.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3788-3793Google Scholar, 8Seth R. Raymond F.D. Makgoba M.W. Lancet. 1991; : 338-344Google Scholar). While the exact origin of sICAM-1 is unclear, sICAM-1 may be produced directly from the membrane-bound form by proteolytic cleavage (9Stanciu L.A. Djukanvic R. Eur. Respir. J. 1998; 11: 946-957Google Scholar, 10Leung K.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 734-739Google Scholar) or produced independently by an alternative splicing mechanism (11Wakatsuki T. Kimura K. Kimura F. Shinomiya N. Ohtsubo M. Ishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Cell. Adhesion Commun. 1995; 3: 283-292Google Scholar). What role is played by soluble ICAM-1 in disease pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. Previous studies have demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines can alter the expression of mICAM-1 (3Papi A. Johnston S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9707-9720Google Scholar, 12Sethi S.K.

Grewe M. Kapp A. Schopf E. Krutmann J. Exp. Dermatol. 1992; 1: 27-30Google Scholar). In addition, HRV infection has been shown to significantly up-regulate the expression of its membrane-bound receptor ICAM-1 on the surface of epithelial cells (3Papi A. Johnston S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9707-9720Google Scholar, 12Sethi S.K. Bianco A. Allen J.T. Knight R.A. Spiteri M.A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 110: 362-369Google Scholar, 13Bianco A. Sethi S.K. Allen J.T.

J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L749-L759Google Scholar) leading to an increase in epithelial cell infectivity (12Sethi S.K. Bianco A. Allen J.T. Knight R.A. Spiteri M.A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 110: 362-369Google Scholar). However, there is evidence indicating that sICAM-1 may have the opposite effect because it possesses antiviral properties both in vitro (17Arruda E. Crump C.E. Marlin S.D. Merluzzi V.J. Hayden F.G. Antimicrobiol. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 1186-1191Google Scholar) and in vivo (18Huguenel E.D. Cohn D. Dockum D.P. Greve J.M. Fournel M.A. Hammond L. Irwin R. Mahoney J. McClelland A. Muchmore E. Ohlin C. Scunderi P. Am. J. Respir. Crit Care. Med. 1997; 155: 1206-1210Google Scholar, 19Turner R.B. Wecker M.T. Pohl G. Witek T.J. McNally E. St George R. Winther B. Hayden F.G. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 281: 1797-1804Google Scholar). Therefore, the dynamic inter-relationship between mICAM-1 and sICAM-1 forms may have a critical bearing on the pathogenesis as well as course of HRV infection. Thus, there is a need for a better understanding of the interaction between mICAM-1 and sICAM-1, leading to potential targets for therapeutic modulation of the course of HRV infection. To investigate this hypothesis, a series of studies were undertaken to establish the presence of distinct mRNA transcripts coding for mICAM-1 and sICAM-1 in an in vitro airway epithelial cell model and to determine whether HRV has the ability to modulate the two forms of ICAM-1 and how this affects epithelial cell infectivity. Having found that epithelial cells express the two ICAM-1 forms and that HRV could selectively modulate membrane and soluble ICAM-1 expression in an inverse fashion to promote/propagate infection, we explored the potential intracellular mechanisms influencing this differential modulation to identify potential targets for antiviral therapy. ICAM-1 is a rapid response gene with a complex pattern of regulation (20Stratowa C. Audette M. Immunobiol. 1995; 193: 293-304Google Scholar). Numerous second messenger signaling pathways involved in the activation of the ICAM-1 gene have been identified (20Stratowa C. Audette M. Immunobiol. 1995; 193: 293-304Google Scholar, 21Van der Stolpe A. van der Saag P.T. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 13-33Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that HRV up-regulates membrane-bound ICAM-1 expression in airway epithelial cells via an NFκB-dependent mechanism (3Papi A. Johnston S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9707-9720Google Scholar). We investigated this intracellular signaling pathway further and examined the effect of HRV on tyrosine kinase phosphorylation in airway epithelial cells. In addition, we utilized inhibitors of gene transcription and protein synthesis to investigate potential mechanisms responsible for the modulation of sICAM-1 production/release during HRV infection. Our results demonstrate that HRV selectively induces mICAM-1 expression on epithelial cells, at least in part, through a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway, while, HRV influence on sICAM-1 release may involve the down-regulation/inhibition of proteolytic enzymes associated with the cleavage of mICAM-1 from the epithelial cell surface. The interaction of HRV with these intracellular molecular pathways controlling mICAM-1/sICAM-1 ratios will need to be further dissected, specifically for the development of new anti-HRV strategies aimed at either halting progression or reversing host cell infectivity. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were obtained from Clonetics Corp., Walkersville, MD. The donor was a middle-aged male Caucasian. NHBE cells were cultured in small airway basal medium (SABM) supplemented with epidermal growth factor (25 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (0.5 ॖg/ml), insulin (5 ॖg/ml), transferrin (10 ॖg/ml), epinephrine (0.5 ॖg/ml), triiodothyronine (6.5 ng/ml), bovine pituitary extract (52 ॖg/ml), retinoic acid (0.1 ng/ml), gentamicin (50 mg/ml), amphotericin B (50 ॖg/ml) at 37 °C in humidified air containing 57 CO2. All reagents were obtained from Clonetics Corp. In subsequent experiments, NHBE cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/well and utilized when 70–807 confluent. The main rhinovirus seed (HRV-14) was kindly donated by J. Kent (University of Leicester). A stock solution of HRV-14 was generated by infecting confluent monolayers of HeLa Ohio cell line as described previously (Sethi et al., Ref. 12Sethi S.K. Bianco A. Allen J.T. Knight R.A. Spiteri M.A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 110: 362-369Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent monolayers of Hela cells were inoculated with a known dilution (102.5, TCID50/ml) of HRV-14 and incubated for 90 min at 34 °C in humidified air containing 57 CO2, after which, cells were cultured until the cytopathic effect (CPE) was >807. Medium containing virus was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min, after which the viral suspension was stored at −80 °C until required. Prior to use viral stocks were purified using a sucrose gradient. 20 ॖg/ml RNase A (Sigma) was added to the viral suspension and incubated at 35 °C for 20 min. 17 sodium sarkosyl (Sigma) and 2-mercaptoethanol (1 ॖg/ml) were added to the RNase-treated viral suspension. This was then overlaid on 1 ml of purification solution (20 mm Tris acetate, 1 mNaCl, 307 w/v sucrose) and centrifuged at 200,000 × gfor 5 h at 16 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the resulting virus pellet was resuspended in medium and stored at −80 °C until required. Once cell monolayers were 70–807 confluent the culture medium was removed, and the cells were inoculated with HRV-14 102.5 TCID50/ml for 90 min at 34 °C, 57 CO2/air. The cells were washed, and maintenance medium was added to sustain cell growth. The gene and protein expression of the two ICAM-1 forms were measured simultaneously at 0, 8, 24, and 96 h postinfection. 0 h represents the point immediately after the 90-min inoculation period; subsequent time points (8–96 h) are taken from this 0 h. Membrane-bound ICAM-1 expression was evaluated at 0, 8, 24, and 96 h post-HRV-14 infection. At each time point, cells from 6-well plates were collected via trypsinization and centrifugation; 6 cytospins for each experimental condition at each time point were prepared for immunostaining. The remaining cells were utilized for RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Internal controls consisting of unstimulated and uninfected cells were set up at each time point to allow comparisons between controls and treated cells. A cytokeratin immunoglobulin IgG-specific monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used to confirm the epithelial origin of NHBE cell lines. Surface ICAM-1 was semiquantified using a 3-step indirect immunoenzymatic labeling method (22His E.D. Remick D.G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 89-94Google Scholar) and modified as described previously (12Sethi S.K. Bianco A. Allen J.T. Knight R.A. Spiteri M.A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 110: 362-369Google Scholar, 13Bianco A. Sethi S.K. Allen J.T. Knight R.A. Spiteri M.A. Eur. Respir. J. 1998; 12: 619-626Google Scholar). Briefly, exogenous peroxidase staining was blocked using 27 bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline solution. NHBE cells were incubated with ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody at a concentration of 5 ॖg/ml, (R1/1.1, IgG, Boehringer Ingelheim) at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were then washed using a washing buffer (Tris stock solution, 0.05 mol/liter, pH 7.4, NaCl, 0.97 saline solution), and incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjuagated to peroxidase at a concentration of 1 mg/ml (Dako) for 30 min; the cells were then washed again. A third antibody, swine anti-rabbit IgG also conjugated to peroxidase, (DAKO), was then added at a concentration of 0.8 mg/ml to amplify the staining intensity. The cells were then incubated with the substrate 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochroride (0.6 mg/ml, Sigma) and stained with Mayers Hemalum solution (BDH). The cells were incubated with an anti-mouse IgG antibody (Coulter clone) at a concentration of 10 ॖg/ml, which acted as a negative control. To avoid observer bias, the cytospins were scored by two independent observers (A. Bianco and S. Whiteman); a mean of three readings of each slide was performed. Two cytospins for each experimental condition per time point were assessed at ×400 magnification with a light microscope (Olympus CH-2 microscope, Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo). 300 cells per microscopic field were counted and surface ICAM-1 on epithelial cells was assessed using a 5 point scoring scale based on the intensity of staining and appearance of the nucleus: 0, gray/brown; 1, light brown; 2, medium brown; 3, medium/dark brown; 4, dark brown; in grades 0–2 the nucleus appears well defined, in 3–4 the nucleus is partially or fully obliterated. The number of cells scored in each grade was then multiplied with the respective grade index, and the resulting values summed. The final result was expressed as the Pox score (12Sethi S.K. Bianco A. Allen J.T. Knight R.A. Spiteri M.A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 110: 362-369Google Scholar, 13Bianco A. Sethi S.K. Allen J.T. Knight R.A. Spiteri M.A. Eur. Respir.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 89-94Google Scholar), defined as the difference between the sum of the specific and background staining: [(a × 0) + (b × 1) + (c × 2) + (d × 3) + (e × 4)] − value for the control slide = POX score, where each letter represents the number of cells scored in the respective grade. The coefficient of variability of the differences between the counts obtained from all slides by both observers was between 4 and 127; and that between the two observers for each time point was less than 57. Soluble ICAM-1 expression was also evaluated at 0, 8, 24, and 96 h post-HRV-14 infection. Internal controls consisting of unstimulated and uninfected cells were setup at each time point to allow comparisons between controls and treated cells. Cell culture supernatants retrieved from each experimental condition at each time point were assayed for soluble ICAM-1 using a commercially available ELISA kit (BioSource International, CA). The minimum detectable level of human soluble ICAM-1 (hsICAM-1) was <0.04 ng/ml. 100 ॖl of undiluted cell culture supernatant or standard were utilized in the assay, which was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines. Total RNA was extracted from NHBE cells at 0, 8, 24, and 96-h postinfection using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines, and cDNA was synthesized from 2 ॖg of RNA. cDNA synthesis was conducted in a reaction mixture containing 20 pmol oligo(dT) primer, 5× buffer (50 mm, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2), 0.5 mMdNTP mixture, 0.5 units of RNase inhibitors, and 200 units of MMLV reverse transcriptase; the total reaction volume was 20 ॖl. All cDNA synthesis reagents were obtained from Clontech. This was then incubated at 42 °C for 1 h after which the reverse transcriptase and DNase were heat-inactivated at 94 °C for 5 min. The cDNA was then diluted to a final volume of 100 ॖl and stored at −80 °C for RT-PCR. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) was used as a control for cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR. Primers used to detect G3PDH were 5′-TGA AGG TCG GAG TCA GA-3′ (sense) and CAT GTG GGC CAT GAG GTC CAC CAC (antisense). Primers for the detection of mICAM-1 and sICAM-1 were based on those described previously by Wakatsuki et al. (11Wakatsuki T. Kimura K. Kimura F. Shinomiya N. Ohtsubo M. Ishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Cell. Adhesion Commun. 1995; 3: 283-292Google Scholar). The sequence of the forward primer used to detect mICAM-1 was 5′-CAA GGG GAG GTC ACC CGC GAG GTG-3′ and 5′-CAA GGG AGG TCA CCC GCG AGC C-3′. Both primers were used in combination with a common reverse primer with the following sequence 5′-TGC AGT GCC CAT TAT GAC TG-3′. These primer pairs encompass the transmembrane domain of ICAM-1. The primers used to detect HRV were CGG ACA CCC AAA GTA G (sense) and GCA CTT CTG TTT CCC C (antisense). The RT-PCR consisted of 25 pmol of primers, 200 ॖm dNTPs, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 5 ॖl 10× PCR buffer, and 2.5 units of Amplitaq Gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a 50-ॖl reaction mixture in a thermal cycler (PTC 200 Pielter Thermal cycler) under the following conditions: 95 °C for 12 min, 94 °C for 1 min and 15 s (denaturation step), 60 °C (G3PDH) or 65 °C (ICAM-1) for 1 min and 15 s (annealing step) and 72 °C for 1 min (extension step) for a total of 30 cycles (G3PDH) or 35 cycles (ICAM-1), after which a final extension step was performed at 72 °C for 10 min. RT-PCR products were resolved using 37 metaphor agarose (Flowgen) gel in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, Sigma). Gels were visualized using ethidium bromide and UV light and analyzed densitometrically (Model GS-670, BioRad) using Molecular Analyst (version 1.5). Restriction endonucleases were used to confirm the size of the RT-PCR products. Membrane-bound ICAM-1 RT-PCR products were digested to give product sizes of 45 and 57 base pairs, and soluble ICAM-1 RT-PCR products were digested at the site of the deletion to give 63 and 20 bp products. In addition, to confirm the presence of the 19-bp deletion, RT-PCR amplicons were sequenced using an ABI PRISM automated sequencer model 310. The TCID50 method was used to calculate the concentration of the virus in cell culture supernatants at 0, 8, 24, and 96 h postinfection. Serial dilutions of cell culture supernatants were incubated in cell monolayers in 96-well plates for 5 days at 34 °C in humidified air containing 57CO2. The presence of cytopathic effect (CPE) in the wells was used to calculate the TCID50 using the Karber formula (12Sethi S.K. Bianco A. Allen J.T. Knight R.A. Spiteri M.A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 110: 362-369Google Scholar, 13Bianco A. Sethi S.K. Allen J.T. Knight R.A. Spiteri M.A. Eur. Respir. J. 1998; 12: 619-626Google Scholar, 14Terajima M. Yamaya M. Sekizawa K. Okinaga S. Suzuki T. Yamada N. Nakayama K. Ohrui T. Oshima T. Namazaki Y. Sasaki H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L749-L759Google Scholar). Furthermore, cell infectivity was confirmed by detecting the presence of HRV RNA within the cell using RT-PCR (23Papadopoulos N.G. Hunter J. Sanderson G. Meyer J. Johnston S.L. J. Virol. Methods. 1999; 80: 179-185Google Scholar). To confirm the changes observed in ICAM-1 expression were true effects of HRV and not due to soluble factors within the viral inoculum, separate studies were designed using anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibodies to block HRV attachment and subsequent infection. NHBE cell monolayers were washed and incubated with anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (R1/1.1 Boerhinger Ingelheim) at separate concentrations of 4, 8, and 16 ॖg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C under 57 CO2-humidified air (24Hakonarson H. Maskeri N. Carter C. Hodinka R.L. Campbell D. Grunstein M.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1732-1741Google Scholar). After which the anti-ICAM-1 mAb solution was removed, and cell monolayers were washed and inoculated with HRV-14 at a concentration of 102.5 TCID50/ml for 90 min at 34 °C under 57 CO2-humidified air. After 90 min the viral inoculum was removed, cell monolayer washed, and maintenance medium was replaced. Gene expression of both ICAM-1 forms was evaluated using RT-PCR at 24 h, because this time point was previously shown to reflect an optimum response in gene expression. Corresponding viral titers were also measured. To assess the level at which HRV-14 regulates the expression of both ICAM-1 receptors, separate cell cultures were preincubated with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis at a concentration of 10 ॖg/ml for 2 h at 37 °C in humidified air containing 57 CO2. Cycloheximide is widely used as an inhibitor of protein synthesis and has an effect at 10 ॖg/ml (25Jackson A.M. Alexandrov A.B. Gribben S.C. Esuvarnathan K. James K. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 921-925Google Scholar). The cell monolayers were then washed and infected with HRV-14 as described above. Membrane and soluble ICAM-1 protein levels were assessed as described above. Actinomycin D, an inhibitor of gene transcription was used to assess the effect of HRV-14 on ICAM-1 gene transcription. NHBE cells were incubated with actinomycin D at a concentration of 10 ॖg/ml for 2 h at 37 °C in humidified air containing 57 CO2. 10 ॖg/ml was identified as the optimum dose in previous dose response experiments (data not shown). The cell monolayers were then washed and infected with HRV-14 as described above. Membrane-bound and soluble ICAM-1 were assessed using RT-PCR and semiquantified using densitometry (Model GS-670, BioRad) and Molecular Analyst Software (version 1.5). The involvement of tyrosine kinase in the HRV-driven up-regulation of mICAM-1 gene expression was investigated using Western blot. NHBE cells were cultured in SABM (detailed under 舠Materials and Methods舡) and infected with HRV-14 (TCID50 102.5) for the indicated times (0–30 min, 0 min represents the viral inoculum placed on the cell monolayer and then immediately removed). Cell were also pretreated with genistein (50 and 100 ॖm), an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase for 1 h at 37 °C in 57 CO2-humidified air. NHBE cells were lysed using a lysis buffer containing 17 Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm sodium chloride, 107 glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 ॖm leupeptin, and 0.15 units/ml aprotinin. All reagents were molecular biology grade and obtained from Sigma. The cells were placed on ice for 20 min, and total protein was collected by centrifugation. Total protein was assayed using a commercially available kit based on the Lowry assay (Bio-Rad). 25 ॖg of reduced protein samples were electrophoresed on 12.57 SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (sandwiches, 0.45-ॖm pore size Novex, San Diego). Molecular weight markers and epidermal growth factor receptor (control) were run with the samples. Membranes were blocked with 107 (w/v) low fat milk for 1 h in TBS-T and probed for 2 h with mouse anti-human phosphotyrosine kinase (clone 4G10, Upstate Technology) diluted 1:3000 in TBS-T. Membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Dako) diluted 1:40,000 in TBS-T for 1 h. The ECL system was used for detection (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were reprobed with a control mouse IgG as a negative control. The membranes were analyzed densitometrically (Model GS-670, BioRad) and Molecular Analyst Software (version 1.5). Each experiment was performed three times. Data were expressed as means ± S.E., and comparisons between experimental conditions and controls were performed by paired Student's t test. Probability values < 0.05 were considered significant. Two distinct mRNA transcripts were observed in NHBE cells after RT-PCR (Fig. 1). These RT-PCR products corresponded with those observed by Wakatsuki et al. (11Wakatsuki T. Kimura K. Kimura F. Shinomiya N. Ohtsubo M. Ishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Cell. Adhesion Commun. 1995; 3: 283-292Google Scholar) with RT-PCR products of 102 and 83 bp for mICAM-1 and sICAM-1, respectively. Product sizes were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion (data not shown). mICAM-1 surface protein was constitutively expressed in NHBE cells (Fig.2A). HRV-14 infection induced an up-regulation in both surface mICAM-1 protein and gene expression (Fig. 2, A and B). Surface mICAM-1 protein expression on NHBE cells increased by 2.5-fold over baseline at 8-h post-HRV-14 infection (*, p < 0.001, Fig.2A). The enhanced mICAM-1 protein levels were sustained throughout the 96-h period of infection and was accompanied by a 2-fold increase in mICAM-1 gene expression (normalized to the housekeeping gene G3PDH) only at 24 h through to 96 h (*,p = 0.02, Fig. 2B). Basal sICAM-1 protein release in cell culture supernatants increased at 8 h and thereafter decreased in a time-dependent manner. However, no sICAM-1 protein was detected in cell culture supernatants retrieved from HRV-infected cell lines at any time point studied. Gene analysis showed that HRV-14 infection induced a persistent down-regulation in sICAM-1 gene expression in NHBE cells over the study period (0–96 h); with sICAM-1 mRNA levels decreasing to half-basal mRNA levels at 24 h (*,p < 0.001, Table I). Fig. 1 illustrates the simultaneous changes in membrane and soluble ICAM-1 gene expression during HRV infection of NHBE cells.Table IEffect of HRV-14 on sICAM-1 gene expressionTime post-HRV-14 infectionsICAM-1 gene expression, ratio to G3PDH ± S.E.ControlHRV-14 infectedh 00.9 ± 0.040.3 ± 0.02 81.0 ± 0.010.7 ± 0.03240.9 ± 0.0050.4 ± 0.02*961.4 ± 0.050.9 ± 0.01*sICAM-1 gene expression was semi quantified using RT-PCR and densitometry and expressed as a ratio to the housekeeping geneG3PDH.

Data are mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments (*, p < 0.05 compared to control). A steep increase in viral titers was observed at 8 h, where viral titers reached 6-fold (*,p < 0.01, Fig.3A). Viral titers remained elevated through to 96 h. The presence of HRV RNA within the NHBE cells was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3B). RT-PCR produced an amplicon of 383–392 bp, which was further digested usingBglI to give a product of 190 base pairs confirming the presence of rhinoviral RNA (data not shown). In order to confirm that the observed changes in epithelial cell membrane and soluble ICAM-1 expression, reflected the direct influence of HRV-14, separate blocking experiments were carried out using anti-ICAM-1 mAb. NHBE cultures were incubated with ICAM-1 mAb prior to HRV-14 infection. mICAM-1 and sICAM-1 gene expression were"

Mutations inATP7B lead to Wilson's disease, a severe disorder with neurological and hepatic manifestations. One of the most common disease mutations, a H1069Q substitution, causes intracellular mislocalization of ATP7B (the Wilson's disease protein, WNDP). His-1069 is located in the nucleotide-binding domain of WNDP and is conserved in all copper-transporting ATPases from bacteria to mammals; however, the specific role of this His in the structure and function of WNDP remains unclear. We demonstrate that substitution of His-1069 for Gln, Ala, or Cys does not significantly alter the folding of the WNDP nucleotide-binding domain or the proteolytic resistance of the full-length WNDP. In contrast, the function of WNDP is markedly affected by the mutations. The ability to form an acylphosphate intermediate in the presence of ATP is entirely lost in all three mutants, suggesting that His-1069 is important for ATP-dependent phosphorylation. Other steps of the WNDP enzymatic cycle are less dependent on His-1069. The H1069C mutant shows normal phosphorylation in the presence of inorganic phosphate; it binds an ATP analogue, β,γ-imidoadenosine 5′-triphosphate (AMP-PNP), and copper and undergoes nucleotide-dependent conformational transitions similar to those of the wild-type WNDP. Although binding of AMP-PNP is not disrupted by the mutation, the apparent affinity for the nucleotide is decreased by 4-fold. We conclude that His-1069 is responsible for proper orientation of ATP in the catalytic site of WNDP prior to ATP hydrolysis.

Menkes disease protein AMP-PNP, β,γ-imidoadenosine 5′-triphosphate wild-type 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid bathocuproine disulfonate ATP-binding domain circular dichroism Copper is a cofactor of important metabolic enzymes that are involved in a variety of physiological processes such as radical detoxification, oxidative phosphorylation, and iron metabolism. The key role in copper distribution in human cells belongs to the copper-transporting ATPases ATP7A and ATP7B (Menkes disease and Wilson's disease proteins, respectively). These large polytopic membrane proteins utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport copper from the cytosol into the lumen of the secretory compartment where copper can be incorporated into various copper-dependent enzymes (1Harris E.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 291-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). When intracellular copper exceeds a certain level, the copper-transporting ATPases traffic to the plasma membrane where they export excess copper out of the cell (2Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar,3Llanos R.M. Mercer J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Mutations in ATP7A and ATP7Bresult in disruption of copper transport from the cytosol and severe pathologies in humans, i.e. Menkes disease and Wilson's disease, respectively. Menkes disease and Wilson's disease proteins (MNKP1 and WNDP) belong to a family of the P-type ATPases. The primary structure of MNKP and WNDP include several signature sequences (Fig. 1A) that are essential for enzymatic activity of all members of this family. The ATP-binding domain of WNDP and MNKP also contains a sequence SEHPL, which is conserved in all ATPases transporting transition metals (the P1-type ATPases or CPx-ATPases) but not in other P-type ATPases (Fig. 1). In the SEHPL sequence, His is an invariant residue (Fig. 1B, alignment), suggesting that this amino acid is essential for function or structure of the P1-type ATPases. Significantly, substitution of His-1069 in WNDP for Gln is the most frequent cause of Wilson's disease in northern European populations (4Thomas G.R. Roberts E.A. Walshe J.M. Cox D.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 1315-1319PubMed Google Scholar), an observation that underscores the importance of His-1069. Recent studies have shown that mutations of His-1069 to Gln or Ala result in decreased intracellular stability of WNDP and retention of the mutants in the endoplasmic reticulum (5Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 6Huster D. Hoppert M. Zinke J. Lutsenko S. Lehmann C. Mossner J. Berr F. Caca K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 335-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar); the latter effect can be overcome by lowering the temperature at which the cells are grown (5Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These results suggested a role for His-1069 in folding and stability of WNDP. In contrast, replacement of the equivalent His residue in MNKP, which is 60% homologous to WNDP, does not alter the protein steady-state levels and does not disrupt normal targeting of MNKP to the trans-Golgi network (7Petris M.J. Voskoboinik I. Cater M. Smith K. Kim B.E. Llanos R.M. Strausak D. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46736-46742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), indicating that in MNKP the structural consequences of His replacement are minor. Thus, it remains unclear whether His-1069 plays an important role in the structural organization of WNDP. The effect of the H1069Q substitution on the transport function of WNDP was analyzed by the ability of the mutant protein do the following: (i) complement the growth defects of a Δccc2 yeast strain lacking the WNDP homologue Ccc2 (8Hung I.H.

Wakabayashi T. Miura N. Koyama K. Futai M. Sugiyama T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); and (ii) decrease the toxic effects of copper on growth of fibroblasts in cell culture (5Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrated that mutations of His-1069 impaired the transport function of WNDP. However, the specific role of this invariant histidine in copper transport by WNDP has not been explained. To elucidate the functional role of His-1069, we substituted His-1069 for various amino acid residues and characterized the effects of these mutations on WNDP folding and enzymatic activity. Our experiments indicate that His-1069 is important for a specific step in the WNDP catalytic cycle, phosphorylation from ATP, and is not critical for other steps of the enzymatic reaction or for overall protein folding. His-1069 appears to control, directly or indirectly, positioning of ATP in the active site of WNDP. The H1069Q, H1069A, and H1069C mutants of WNDP were generated using polymerase chain reaction. The following forward and reverse primer pairs were used to introduce His → Gln, His → Ala, and His → Cys substitutions, respectively: 5′-AGCAGTGAACAACCCTTGGGCGTGG and 5′-ACGCCCAAGGGTTGTTCACTGCTGG; 5′-AGCAGTGAAGCTCCCTTGGGCGTGG and 5′-ACGCCCAAGGGAGCTTCACTGCTGG; and 5′-AGCAGTGAATGCCCCTTGGGCGTGG and 5′-ACGCCCAAGGGGCATTCACTGCTGG. The oligonucleotides: 5′-GGTATGGATTGTAATCGG-3′ and 5′-CGTCGACGCCTGCCTGAA-3′ were used as a forward and reverse flanking primers. Following PCR, the fragments containing mutations were digested with the ClaI and SalI restriction endonucleases and the ClaI-SalI fragments were exchanged with the corresponding fragment of the wild-type, full-length WNDP cDNA cloned into the pFastBacDual-WNDP plasmid. Generation of the pFastBacDual-WNDP plasmid has been described previously (10Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The presence of the mutations in the final construct and the absence of unwanted mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The generated plasmids were then utilized to produce recombinant baculoviruses; the wild-type (wt) and mutant WNDPs were then expressed using virus-mediated infection of SF9 cells as described previously (10Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Expression of the WNDP mutants was verified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-WNDP antibodies; the amount of expressed protein was determined by densitometry of the Coomassie-stained bands. The level of expression for mutant proteins was, on average, ∼50–70% of wt WNDP. The membrane preparations of insect cells expressing either wt or mutant WNDP were isolated according to Ref. 10Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar; the membrane protein was stored at −80 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and 250 mm sucrose until further use. Analysis of WNDP phosphorylation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP was carried out as described in Ref. 10Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar. 50 μg of membrane protein preparation was resuspended in 200 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm MES-Tris (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 20% Me2SO (Pi-buffer), and then 0.66 μl of 100 μCi of32Pi (specific activity, 6000 Ci/mmol) was added to the mixture. Following a 10 min incubation at room temperature, 50 μl of 1 mm NaH2PO4 in 50% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was added to stop the reaction, and precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min and then rinsed with 1 ml of cold H2O. The protein was resuspended in the sample buffer (5 mm Tris-PO4, pH 5.8, 6.7 m urea, 0.4 m dithiothreitol, 5% SDS), and incorporation of32P into WNDP was analyzed on acidic SDS-PAGE as described (10Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of ATP and the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue β,γ-imidoadenosine 5′-triphosphate (AMP-PNP) on phosphorylation of WNDP by 32Pi, 50 μg of membrane preparation containing either wt or mutant WNDP was pre-incubated in Pi-buffer with increasing concentrations of the nucleotide (10 μm–2 mm) for 10 min at room temperature, and then Pi-mediated phosphorylation was carried out as described above. To determine the effect of copper on phosphorylation from Pi, wt and mutant WNDPs were incubated at room temperature in Pi buffer containing 100 μmTris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and 100 μmascorbate in the absence or presence of 250 μm copper chelator bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS) and then phosphorylated by Pi as described above. To reverse the effect of the chelator, 135 μm CuCl2 was added to the WNDP sample preincubated with 250 μm BCS. BCS binds copper with a stoichiometry of 2:1; thus this procedure generates 10 μm free copper in a solution. Following 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the Pi phosphorylation reaction was then carried out as described above. The expression plasmid pET28b-ATP-BD encoding the ATP-binding domain of WNDP (ATP-BD, amino acid residues Lys-1010 to Ly-1325) was described previously (11Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To introduce various mutations of His-1069 into the recombinant ATP-BD, the Bsu36I-PstI fragments of the mutant full-length WNDP cDNA generated as described above were excised from the pFastBacDual-WNDP plasmid and cloned into the pET28b-ATP-BD plasmid digested with the Bsu36I and PstI restriction endonucleases. Expression in E. coli and purification of mutant ATP-BDs were performed according to (11Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Protein expression and purity were verified by SDS-PAGE on 12% Laemmli gels. The effect of His-1069 substitutions on ATP-BD folding was analyzed using intrinsic Trp fluorescence as described in (11Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and by circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD). The CD spectra in the region 180–260 nm were recorded in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 250 mm NaF buffer at a protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml using an AVIV CD model 215 spectrometer. The protein concentration was verified by amino acid analysis of corresponding samples and further used to calculate the Δε values. The secondary structure contents in WNDP and its mutants were estimated using the set of 43 reference protein spectra and the following algorithms of CD spectra deconvolution: CONTIN, SELCON3, CDSSTR, and CDNN (12Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar). 10 μg of membrane preparations from insect cells expressing the wt WNDP or His mutants was resuspended in 20 μl of 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and 250 mm sucrose buffer. Tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma) was added up to 0.83 μg/ml, and the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The proteolytic reaction was terminated by addition of the protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) to 2 μm. The reaction mixture was then diluted to 100 μl with SDS-PAGE loading buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 3.3% SDS, 2.6 murea, 5% β-mercaptoethanol), and 10 μl of the mixture was loaded onto a 7.5% Laemmli gel. Following separation and Western blotting, the WNDP proteolytic pattern was analyzed by immunostaining using anti-ATP-BD antibody as described previously (10Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the nucleotide binding on proteolytic sensitivity of WNDP and the H1069C mutant, 10 μg of respective membrane preparations were incubated in 20 μl of 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and 250 mm sucrose buffer with an increasing concentration of AMP-PNP (0–50 μm) for 10 min at room temperature. Trypsin was then added, and the proteolytic digestion and analysis of the fragments were performed as described above. The high resolution structure of the ATP-binding domain of SERCA1 Ca2+-ATPase (residues Ala-320 to Lys-758) was utilized as a template to generate a molecular model for the ATP-binding domain of WNDP (residues Met-996 to Arg-1322). The ATP-binding domain of WNDP is composed of segments Val-997 to Ala-1065, Asp-1185 to Ile-1236, and Phe-1240 to Ile1311, which share significant homology with Ca2+-ATPase. Segment Ser-1066 to Ile-1184 of ATP-BD is located between these homologous regions and has little similarity to the corresponding region of Ca2+-ATPase. The secondary structure predictions for WNDP and subsequent search in the data base of high-resolution structures using threading algorithms revealed that the predicted fold of the ATP-binding domain of WNDP matches unequivocally to the fold of the Ca2+-ATPase ATP-binding domain in both conserved and non-conserved regions. The alignment of sequences and secondary structures generated by the GenTHREADER program (13Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 797-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) served as a basis for the ATP-BD model. The model was built using Modeler software (14Sali A. Overington J.P. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1582-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and included thorough loop optimization. 25 models with different loop conformations were generated. The model with the highest quality score, as defined by the Profiles_3D program (15Lüthy R. Bowie J.U Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2489) Google Scholar), was selected as the best one. The above procedure was employed to build ATP-BD models using three structural templates, i.e. the high-resolution structures of Ca2+-ATPase in the E1 and E2 states (Protein Data Bank codes 1EUL (16Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar) and 1IWO (17Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), respectively) as well as electron microscopy structure in the E2 state (Protein Data Bank code 1KJU(18Xu C. Rice W.J. He W. Stokes D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)). As shown in Fig.1, His-1069 is located in the ATP-binding domain of WNDP (ATP-BD) and could be essential for correct folding of this important functional domain. To test this hypothesis, we expressed and purified the wt ATP-BD and ATP-BDs in which the His residue was replaced with one of the following amino acid residues, Gln, Ala, and Cys. Analysis of protein folding using CD spectroscopy revealed that overall secondary structure of all mutants is similar to the wt ATP-BD structure (Fig. 2A, and Table I), indicating that the mutations do not cause marked misfolding of this domain.Table ISecondary structure composition of ATP-BD (WT) and the ATP-BD mutants with His-1069 substituted for Ala (HA), Cys (HC), or Gln (HQ)Proteinα-Helixβ-Sheetβ-TurnOther%WT39.2 ± 4.515.0 ± 2.419.5 ± 2.526.3 ± 4.6HA34.2 ± 6.816.3 ± 3.920.8 ± 2.928.8 ± 4.4HC36.3 ± 3.416.0 ± 2.919.8 ± 2.528.0 ± 3.7HQ44.5 ± 6.312.3 ± 3.219.3 ± 4.624.0 ± 5.5Values represent an average and standard deviation of the secondary structure predictions by four different algorithms described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Values represent an average and standard deviation of the secondary structure predictions by four different algorithms described under “Experimental Procedures.” This conclusion was further verified using intrinsic Trp fluorescence. ATP-BD contains a single Trp residue, which has a buried position in the wt protein (11). Unfolding of ATP-BD results in a decrease of Trp fluorescence intensity and a red shift of the fluorescence maximum (11Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B illustrates that even the bulkiest H1069Q substitution does not have a significant negative effect on intrinsic Trp fluorescence of ATP-BD, confirming that His-1069 is not critical for ATP-BD folding. This conclusion was at odds with recent cellular studies wherein decreased stability and mislocalization of the H1069Q mutant pointed to somewhat abnormal folding of the mutated WNDP (5Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Consequently, we hypothesized that mutations of His may alter domain-domain interactions within the full-length WNDP rather than folding of the individual domains. The disruption of this interaction may expose some protein regions to cellular proteases and thus decrease protein stability. To determine the effect of His substitution on folding of the full-length WNDP, the Gln, Cys, and Ala substitutions of His-1069 were introduced into the full-length WNDP, and the mutants were expressed in insect cells using baculovirus-mediated infection of SF9 cells. As shown in Fig.3A, the steady state protein levels were similar for all three mutants and not markedly different from the protein levels of the wt WNDP (∼50–70% of the wt). More importantly, we did not observe significant fragmentation of any of the WNDP mutants, suggesting that the expressed proteins are fairly stable (Fig. 3B). To further evaluate stability of the expressed proteins in vitro, the membrane fractions containing the wt and mutant WNDPs were prepared and subjected to limited tryptic digestion, and the proteolytic resistance of the mutants and wt WNDP was compared. Fig. 3B illustrates that the patterns of proteolytic fragments for the wt and mutant WNDPs are very similar. In some experiments we observed a slight difference in relative abundance of the produced fragments between the mutant and wt WNDPs, suggesting that the replacement of His made the contacts between different regions of the protein somewhat more flexible or exposed. There was also a subtle difference in the proteolytic resistance of the three mutants. Consistently, the H1069A mutant was less resistant than the H1069Q and H1069C mutants, whereas the latter mutant appeared to be the most resistant. Overall however, it is clear that the folding of WNDP is not grossly affected by the His-1069 mutations. As we demonstrated previously, WNDP functions as a copper-dependent P-type ATPase,i.e. during its catalytic cycle WNDP transfers the γ-phosphate from ATP to the invariant Asp-1027, generating a fairly stable phosphorylated intermediate (10Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Consequently, to evaluate the effect of His-1069 mutations on WNDP function, we determined whether the mutants were able to form a catalytic phospho-intermediate. Cell membranes containing wt or mutant WNDP were incubated with γ-[32P]ATP, and incorporation of 32P into WNDP was monitored following separation of membrane proteins on an acidic polyacrylamide gel (19Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytically inactive D1027A mutant of WNDP was used in these experiments as a background control. As shown in Fig. 4A, all three mutants demonstrated markedly reduced phosphorylation activity, which did not exceed that of the inactive D1027A mutant. Catalytic phosphorylation of the mutants could not be detected even when sensitivity of the assay was increased by raising the specific radioactivity of [γ-32P]ATP 10-fold (data not shown). His-1069 is located in the ATP-binding domain of the protein, and one of the reasons for the observed effect could be a dramatic decrease in the affinity of mutant WNDPs for ATP. To explore this possibility, the ATP concentration in the phosphorylation assay was increased up to 1 mm, but no catalytic phosphorylation of any of the His-1069 mutants was detected. Similarly, changing other reaction conditions (temperature, pH of the reaction in the range of 5.0–8.5, buffer composition) did not lead to appearance of the acylphosphate intermediate for any of the mutant WNDPs (data not shown). Altogether, the results suggested that mutations of His-1069 had a strong negative effect on the catalytic function of WNDP. Further experiments were carried out to determine more precisely which step of the catalytic cycle is most affected. The characteristic feature of the P-type ATPases is their ability to form a phosphorylated catalytic intermediate when incubated with inorganic 32P phosphate in the presence of magnesium. This reaction reflects the reversibility of the dephosphorylation step in the enzyme catalytic cycle. The conformational state of the P-type ATPases, which favors phosphorylation from Pi (the E2-state), is different from the one favoring phosphorylation from ATP (the E1-state). Consequently, we used phosphorylation from Pi to test whether the His-1069 mutations eliminated phosphorylation in general or specifically affected the ATP-dependent step of the catalytic cycle. This experiment produced an interesting result (Fig. 4, B–D). The H1069Q and H1069A mutants demonstrated markedly reduced level of phosphorylation from Pi (∼5–10%). In contrast, the H1069C mutant was phosphorylated at levels close to the wt phosphorylation (80–90%). These results indicate that His-1069 is not essential for phosphorylation of WNDP by PI; however, the 1069 position plays an important role in the environment of the catalytic site. In the P-type ATPases, phosphorylation from Pi takes place when the exported ion is released from the transport site, allowing the protein to adopt the E2 conformation. Accordingly, addition of the transported ion to the reaction prevents formation of the E2 state and decreases the Pi-mediated phosphorylation. This property of the P-type ATPases was used to test whether the His mutations have an effect on the ability of WNDP to bind copper at the site(s) important for catalytic phosphorylation. As shown in Fig.5, addition of the copper chelator BCS to the wt WNDP stimulates phosphorylation of WNDP from Pi, whereas the addition of copper inhibits the phosphorylation reaction in agreement with the predicted properties of WNDP as a P-type ATPase. Importantly, the His-1069 mutants behaved in these reactions similarly to the wt WNDP, confirming that the His substitutions do not compromise the ability of mutants to bind copper. Further studies were carried out with the H1069C mutant, which showed close to normal phosphorylation from Pi and normal response to copper additions but could not be phosphorylated from ATP. One explanation for this phenotype is that binding of ATP is disrupted by the mutation. Alternatively, the H1069C mutant can bind ATP but fails to undergo conformational transitions in response to nucleotide binding. For WNDP, direct measurements of ATP binding are still technically difficult. Consequently, to examine the above possibilities, we carried out limited proteolysis of WNDP in the presence of increasing concentrations of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, AMP-PNP. As shown in Fig.6A, AMP-PNP alters the proteolytic pattern for both the wt WNDP and the H1069C mutant, making several sites less accessible to proteolytic digestion. Moreover, the same protein regions of the wt WNDP and the mutant became resistant to proteolysis, suggesting that the major structural changes upon binding of AMP-PNP are similar for both proteins. Thus, the lack of ATP-dependent phosphorylation in the case of the H1069C mutant is unlikely due to lack of ATP binding. The proteolysis experiments provide only a rough estimate of the ability of WNDP and the His mutant to bind the nucleotide. It is quite possible that mutations of His-1069 alter the positioning of ATP within the catalytic site rather than disrupt the nucleotide binding. If this is the case, one may expect to see quantitative differences in the nucleotide-binding characteristics of wt WNDP and the H1069C mutant. To characterize ATP binding more quantitatively, we incubated WNDP and the H1069C mutant with increasing concentrations of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue (AMP-PNP) and then measured phosphorylation from Pi. Binding of the nucleotide was expected to stabilize the enzyme in the E1-like state and therefore decrease efficiency of the Pi-mediated phosphorylation. As shown in Fig.6B, the addition of AMP-PNP inhibits incorporation of32Pi for both the wt WNDP and H1069C mutant; however, the efficiency of inhibition is different. The apparentKi values for the wt WNDP and the H1069C mutant are equal to 116 ± 19 μm and 533 ± 166 μm, respectively, suggesting that the H1069C mutant binds AMP-PNP less effectively. Finally, we compared the effects of ATP and AMP-PNP on phosphorylation by 32Pi. ATP is expected to allow enzyme turnover, producing an additional decrease in 32P incorporation compared with AMP-PNP. As shown in Fig. 6C, the addition of ATP to the wt WNDP indeed leads to a larger inhibition of the 32Pi-incorporation than a non-hydrolyzable analogue. In the case of the H1069C mutant, ATP and AMP-PNP have a similar effect on the Pi-mediated phosphorylation, suggesting that ATP binds to the mutant but is not hydrolyzed. To better visualize the position of His-1069 in the ATP-binding domain, we generated a molecular model of the ATP-binding domain using the recently published high resolution structure of Ca2+-ATPase in the E2-conformation (17Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). In this conformation, the nucleotide-binding region (the N-domain) and the phosphorylation region containing the DKTG and GDGXXD motifs (the P-domain) come fairly close together in contrast to the Ca2+-bound form in which these two subdomains are located far apart (16Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). Although the E2-state structure cannot be used to predict the exact position of ATP prior to hydrolysis, the model based on this structure provides a useful guide to relative distances and mutual positions of the residues in the ATP-binding domain. The generated model is shown in Fig.7. It revealed that the spatial location of the SEH1069PL sequence is equivalent to that of the438GEAT441 segment of Ca2+-ATPase. The 438GEAT441 segment is a part of the nucleotide-binding region of Ca2+-ATPase and was shown to be in direct proximity to bound ATP (20). Furthermore, even in the E2 state His-1069 is only 18Å away from the Asp residues of the GDGVND motif that are known to be close to the βγ-phosphates of the ATP-magnesium complex during catalysis (21Pedersen P.A. Jorgensen J.R. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37588-37595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). WNDP has a central role in human copper homeostasis; however, the molecular mechanism of the WNDP-mediated copper transport remains poorly understood. Until recently, the functional characterization of this protein has been hindered by the lack of an expression system suitable for biochemical investigations. Recent development of functional expression of WNDP in insect cells (10Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) opened the door to analysis of the molecular mechanism of WNDP and supplied necessary tools for understanding how disease-causing mutations affect folding, function, and regulation of WNDP. To provide detailed characterization of the Wilson's disease mutations, in this work we expanded our earlier analysis of the enzymatic properties of WNDP. We demonstrated that WNDP can be phosphorylated in the presence of inorganic phosphate and magnesium and that this reaction is facilitated upon removal of copper by BCS and is inhibited by copper addition. We also found that binding of nucleotides induces conformational changes in WNDP. These properties confirmed that the overall catalytic cycle of WNDP resembles those of a typical P-type ATPase. The developed tools were then utilized to characterize the role of His-1069 in the structure and function of WNDP. His-1069 is particularly interesting because it is a site of the most frequent mutation in Wilson's disease patients and an invariant residue in the P1-type ATPases. His-1069 is located in the ATP-binding domain of WNDP, a protein region that is most conserved in all P-type ATPases. The ATP-binding domains of several P-type ATPases have been extensively characterized, and chemical modification, mutagenesis, and NMR studies have yielded a detailed map of residues important for nucleotide binding in Ca2+-ATPase (20Abu-Abed M. Mal T.K. Kainosho M. MacLennan D.H. Ikura M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1156-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, this information has only limited value for understanding the role of His-1069, because this residue lies in the region of the ATP-binding domain (the so called N-subdomain), the sequence of which is unique for the P1-type ATPases. No equivalent histidine is present in the ATP-binding domain of Ca2+-ATPase or other well characterized P2-type ATPases. Conversely, several residues known to play an important role in the binding of ATP in Ca2+-ATPase and other P2-ATPases are absent in WNDP and its homologues. This raises an interesting possibility that, despite overall similarity of the catalytic cycles, the P1-type ATPases and P2-type ATPases have distinct subsets of amino acid residues involved in ATP-coordination and possibly catalysis. The results of our experiments support this hypothesis. The first important result of this work is the demonstration that folding of either the isolated ATP-binding domain or the full-length WNDP is not significantly altered by mutations of His-1069. These results argue against a significant role for this residue in the overall structure of WNDP and seem to be at odds with recent studies showing decreased intracellular stability of the His-1069 mutant (5Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Two considerations may help to reconcile this apparent discrepancy. First, although we observed only a slight increase in proteolytic sensitivity of the His-1069 mutants compared with the wt WNDP, it seems likely that in a cell even small changes in the folding are sufficient to decrease protein stability over time. Second, in the cellular studies the negative effect of the H1069Q mutation on intracellular localization of WNDP was eliminated at room temperature (5Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), suggesting that, at temperatures lower than 37 °C, the folding of WNDP was sufficient to pass quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum. For our studies, we produce WNDP in the insect cells, which grow at 27 °C. Therefore, it seems likely that folding of the WNDP mutants in insect cells is better than in mammalian cells. This unexpected benefit of the protein expression in SF9 cells helped us to marginalize the effect of the His mutations on the WNDP structure and dissect the functional role of His-1069. Functional analysis of the His-1069 mutants revealed that His is not essential for the dephosphorylation step of the catalytic cycle as evidenced by the normal level of Pi-mediated phosphorylation of the H1069C mutant. Mutations of His-1069 do not disrupt copper binding to the site(s) that control catalytic phosphorylation. Similarly, ATP binding by the mutant, although diminished, is not critically affected. This last result is consistent with the lack of significant structural changes in ATP-BD, where ATP coordination is likely to be provided by several amino acid residues. In striking contrast, phosphorylation from ATP is markedly decreased in the mutants, suggesting that His-1069 plays an important role during this step of the catalytic cycle. To better understand the role of His-1069 in ATP-dependent phosphorylation, it is useful to compare the results of our work with recent studies on bacterial homologues of WNDP. The histidine residues equivalent to His-1069 have been mutated in two bacterial P1-type ATPases, a copper-transporting ATPase CopB (22Bissig K.D. Wunderli-Ye H. Duda P.W. Solioz M. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and a zinc and cadmium-transporting ATPase, ZntA (23Okkeri J. Bencomo E. Pietila M. Haltia T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In CopB, the His → Gln mutation drastically reduced the ATPase activity and decreased phosphorylation from ATP by 80% (22Bissig K.D. Wunderli-Ye H. Duda P.W. Solioz M. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In a study of ZntA, introduction of His → Gln mutation also decreased the ATPase activity but less than in the case of CopA (37% of activity remained). The level of phosphorylation from ATP and Pi in ZntA mutants was reduced, and dephosphorylation was slowed down (23Okkeri J. Bencomo E. Pietila M. Haltia T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this earlier work, the multiple consequences of the His substitution made it difficult to assign a specific role to the histidine. Nevertheless, these studies are very helpful. Together with our results, they indicate that His strongly affects the environment in close proximity to the phosphorylated Asp but is not essential for the chemistry of ATP hydrolysis, because ATP-hydrolysis is not abolished in the bacterial ATPase mutants. The mild decrease in the apparent affinity for AMP-PNP and the drastic effect on phosphorylation from ATP observed in our experiments further suggest that His-1069 plays a key role in orienting ATP with respect to catalytic aspartate, thus allowing phosphorylation to occur. The resolution of our methods is currently insufficient to distinguish between direct involvement of His-1069 in coordination of ATP and a more indirect role in which His-1069 interacts with other residues in WNDP and helps to organize the catalytic site by forming specific protein-protein contacts. It seems likely that, prior to transfer of the γ-phosphate, His-1069 directly orients ATP with respect to catalytic Asp, whereas after the phosphorylation step the role of His-1069 became less direct. This conclusion is consistent with the predicted location of His-1069 in the ATP-binding domain (Fig. 7) and is in agreement with our experimental data showing normal PI phosphorylation by the H1069C mutant. The negative effect of the H1069A and H1069Q mutations on Piphosphorylation most likely stems from altered protein-protein contacts within WNDP. It is interesting that H1069A substitution has a stronger negative effect on structure and function of WNDP than either H1069Q or H1069C mutations, suggesting that the presence of a residue that can form a hydrogen bond is tolerated better than the presence of the small and neutral Ala. In summary, we characterized the role of the invariant His-1069 in the structure and function of WNDP. We conclude that His-1069 is important for catalytic activity of WNDP and is likely to be involved in positioning of ATP prior to transfer of the γ-phosphate. Because His in the SEHPL motif is an invariant residue in all P1-type ATPases, it is plausible that this histidine has a similar role in all these transporters. We also demonstrated that, at lower temperatures, the folding of the common Wilson's disease mutant H1069Q is close to normal but that this improvement of protein folding does not restore catalytic activity of WNDP, an important conclusion for future development of the corrective therapies for Wilson's disease.

Functional homologues of this channel have been found in other bacteria (11Moe P.C. Blount P. Kung C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 583-592Google Scholar) and Archea (12Kloda A. Martinac B. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 229-240Google Scholar), and structurally related protein from Neurospora has been also reported (13Koprowski P. Kubalski A. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 1148-1158Google Scholar). The functional channel is a pentamer, and each subunit consists of two α-helical membrane-spanning domains TM1 and TM2 with both the C and N termini located in the cytoplasm (6Chang G. Spencer R.H. Lee A.T. Barclay M.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1998; 282: 2220-2226Google Scholar). TM1s line the pore, and their hydrophobic residues form the primary, transmembrane gate (6Chang G. Spencer R.H. Lee A.T. Barclay M.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1998; 282: 2220-2226Google Scholar, 14Batiza A.N. Rayment I. Kung C. Structure. 1999; 7: R99-R103Google Scholar). It is postulated that there are two gates involved in the opening of the channel: the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic gates (7Sukharev S.I. Betanzos M. Chiang C.-S. Guy H.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 720-724Google Scholar, 8Sukharev S.I. Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 917-936Google Scholar) acting in accordance (15Kong Y. Shen Y. Warth T.E. Ma J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5999-6004Google Scholar). The transmembrane gate is proposed to act as a pressure sensor, and upon application of pressure, this gate permits initial expansion of the channel without its full opening (7Sukharev S.I. Betanzos M. Chiang C.-S. Guy H.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 720-724Google Scholar, 8Sukharev S.I. Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 917-936Google Scholar, 10Betanzos M. Chiang C.S. Guy H.R. Sukharev S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 704-710Google Scholar). It is proposed that the other, cytoplasmic gate, which allows full activation of the channel, is composed of five α-helical S1 segments of the cytoplasmic N termini being connected with TM1s via flexible linkers. According to the model, the applied pressure is transmitted to the S1 segments through the flexible linkers and pulls them apart. The channel may fully open when the interactions between the five S1 segments of the cytoplasmic gate break down (7Sukharev S.I. Betanzos M. Chiang C.-S. Guy H.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 720-724Google Scholar, 8Sukharev S.I. Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 917-936Google Scholar, 10Betanzos M. Chiang C.S. Guy H.R. Sukharev S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 704-710Google Scholar). The activity of MscS, the E. coli MS channel of a smaller conductance (16Martinac B. Buechner M. Delcour A.H. Adler J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2297-2301Google Scholar), consists of activities of two separate ion channels of very similar conductance encoded by yggB andkefA (3Levina N. Tötemeyer S. Stokes N.R. Louis P. Jones M.A. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1730-1737Google Scholar). KefA is a large multidomain protein (1120 amino acids), spanning the inner membrane and possibly having a link to the outer membrane (17McLaggan D. Jones M.A. Gouesbet G. Levina N. Lindey S. Epstein W. Booth I.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 521-536Google Scholar), whereas YggB is a small protein of 286 amino acids residing in the inner membrane. Both proteins show amino acid sequence homology in the region corresponding to the entire YggB sequence (3Levina N. Tötemeyer S. Stokes N.R. Louis P. Jones M.A. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1730-1737Google Scholar) presented in Fig. 1 A. The activities of the KefA and YggB channels recorded directly from theE. coli membrane are kinetically distinct; YggB shows inactivation during sustained pressure, i.e. adaptation (18Koprowski P. Kubalski A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 253-262Google Scholar), whereas KefA does not adapt to pressure (3Levina N. Tötemeyer S. Stokes N.R. Louis P. Jones M.A. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1730-1737Google Scholar, 16Martinac B. Buechner M. Delcour A.H. Adler J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2297-2301Google Scholar). The YggB channels are more abundant than those of KefA, and their activities have been recorded after reconstitution of a purified protein in planar lipid bilayers (19Sukharev S. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 290-298Google Scholar, 20Okada K. Moe P.C. Blount P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27682-27688Google Scholar), indicating that, similar to MscL, YggB senses membrane stress directly. The quaternary structure of the YggB channel was recently published (21Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 298: 1582-1587Google Scholar). The structure reveals that the functional channel is a heptamer and has three transmembrane domains, TM1, TM2, and TM3, in each of seven subunit (Fig. 1 B). The TM3s line the channel pore. The cytoplasmic domains are composed mostly of β-sheets and surround the large water-filled chamber with a diameter of ∼40 Å. Each subunit of the assembly consists of a middle β domain and a lower α/β domain (Fig. 1 B, left view), and all seven subunits are linked together by a β barrel composed of seven strands, which are located at the very ends of the C termini (Fig. 1 B,middle view). In this paper we have studied a possible role for C termini in functioning of the YggB channels. We demonstrate that cross-linking of the YggB C termini yields inactive channels. We also show that intersubunit coordination of Ni2+ in the YggB-His6 channels prevents the channels from opening. The Ni2+ coordination leading to the inhibition of activities occurs in the channel closed state, and we did not observe it in the channel open conformation. This may suggest that the C termini move apart upon channel opening and are involved in the process of the channel gating. Nonpolymerized, microscopy grade glutaraldehyde (GDH) (Grade I) was purchased from Sigma and stored at −80 °C in small aliquots. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) (Sigma) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) (Sigma) were dissolved in the bath solution shortly before use. SDS and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were from Biomol. All of the electrophysiological experiments were performed on E. coli strains: MJF 379, Frag1kefA::kan; MJF429, Frag1kefA::kan yggB −. Frag1 is a wild-type strain, a derivative of E. coli K-12. All of the strains were kindly provided by I. R. Booth (University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK). The construct pYggB-His6 with a histidine tag added to the end of its C terminus was obtained as follows. The yggB open reading frame was amplified from genomic DNA of E. coliwild-type DH5α strain with proofreading Pfu polymerase (Promega) using the following primers: upper primer, 5′-TAGCCCATGG AAGATTTGAATGTTGTC-3′ (underlined bases represent the NcoI restriction endonuclease recognition site, and the sequence of yggb open reading frame is in italics), and lower primer, 5′-GGTACCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATG CGCAGCTTTGTCTTCTTT-3′ (underlined bases represent KpnI restriction endonuclease recognition site; the sequence in italics represents theyggB open reading frame, and the bold sequence codes the six-histidine tag followed by a stop codon). The resulting PCR product was digested with NcoI and KpnI (Promega), purified using QIAex II gel purification kit (Qiagen), and ligated into fragment of pTrc99A vector (Amersham Biosciences) digested withNcoI and KpnI. The resulting plasmid is carrying YggB-His6 under control of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducibletrc(trp/lac) promoter. The pYggBHis6 construct was verified by restriction digestion and sequencing of the insert. The pYggBHis6 construct was expressed in the MJF429 strain. The bacteria were grown at 37 °C overnight in liquid LB broth containing 10 g/liter bacto-tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, and supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). The overnight culture was diluted to A 600 = 0.2, and the bacteria were next grown to A 600 = 0.6. Expression was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The cells were spun down and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Lysate was obtained by treatment of cells with lyzozyme (25 μg/ml) (Sigma) in the buffer C containing 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Merck). The lysate was treated with DNase (5 μg/ml) (Sigma) and spun down in Sorvall SS-34 rotor at 10 000 rpm for 10 min. An insoluble fraction of E. coli cells containing membranes was resuspended in buffer C and divided equally into Eppendorf tubes. NiCl2 or MgCl2 (as indicated) was added to the final concentration of 50 mm, and the samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The membrane fraction was spun down in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm and washed once with buffer C. The pellet was solubilized in 0.5× Laemmli sample buffer and incubated for 5 min at the indicated temperature. For Western blot, the proteins were separated in 9% SDS-PAGE mini-gels and electroblotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked by overnight incubation in 2% bovine serum albumin (SERVA) in TBST buffer (25 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4). The YggB-His6 protein was detected by monoclonal anti-His C-terminal antibodies (Invitrogen) in 1:7500 dilution in TBST. The antibodies did not react with any protein from a lysate of a wild-type E. coli cells (MJF429) not carrying pYggB-His6 (not shown). As secondary antibodies, the anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase antibodies (Promega) in dilution 1:5000 were used. For detection of alkaline phosphatase, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium color substrate (Promega) was used according to manufacturer's instructions. The protein masses and the band intensities were estimated according to prestained protein standards (Bio-Rad) and measured from Western blot scans using Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics). All of the experiments were performed on E. coli giant protoplasts prepared as described previously (22Kubalski A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1238: 177-182Google Scholar). Single channel recordings were obtained from inside-out excised membrane patches, and the experimental procedure, including the equipment used and the application and measuring of suction, was the same as described earlier (18Koprowski P. Kubalski A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 253-262Google Scholar). Bath solution was 150 mm KCl, 400 mm sorbitol, 4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, whereas the pipette solution was the same except that the sorbitol concentration was 300 mm. 60-s intervals or longer were maintained between applications of suction. The data were acquired (with a sampling rate of 2.5 kHz), filtered at 1 kHz, and analyzed using pCLAMP6 software. The mean single-channel open probability, P o during the pressure pulse (not shorter than 12 s) was calculated by integrating the current passing through all active channels I during the pulse and dividing this integral by the current through a single open channeli and the number of active channels N according to the formula P o =I/Ni. Homologues of the E. coli YggB can be found in a wide range of bacteria and archea (3Levina N. Tötemeyer S. Stokes N.R. Louis P. Jones M.A. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1730-1737Google Scholar). In Fig.2 we compared 36 amino acid sequences of bacterial YggB homologues. In this figure each barrepresents a single residue in the YggB sequence and its length is proportional to the identity of amino acids estimated for this residue. Among three membrane domains TM3 shows the highest level of homology as a whole (44% identity comparing to 30 and 23% estimated for TM1 and TM2, respectively), but there are also numerous short spans of C terminus whose identities are higher then 50%, implicating the importance of that region. The model of the MscL gating postulates that the cytoplasmic gate composed of five N termini occludes the pore of the channel until a mechanical force pulls them apart and the channel opens (7Sukharev S.I. Betanzos M. Chiang C.-S. Guy H.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 720-724Google Scholar, 8Sukharev S.I. Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 917-936Google Scholar). If a cytoplasmic gate exists in the YggB channel, it should be composed of its C termini. In the amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic region of YggB all lysines but one (Lys60) are situated in the C terminus (Fig. 1 A). We assumed that cross-linking of lysines from different C termini of the channel would hamper or prevent the channel opening providing its C termini are being pulled apart during opening. We therefore applied lysine-specific reagents to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane patches containing the YggB channels. Fig.3 shows effects of GDH, EDC, and highly lysine-specific BS3 on the channels. Each reagent, at concentration 2 mm, was applied to the closed channels, and the recordings were obtained at positive pipette voltages (+15 mV). Nonpolymerized GDH of undefined cross-linking distance and BS3 with a spacer arm of 11.4 Å inhibited the YggB activity irreversibly, whereas EDC with a spacer arm of 0 did not affect it. Each set of traces in Fig. 3 represents a single experiment, but similar effects of GDH, BS3, and EDC were observed in at least three other experiments in which these cross-linkers were used. The difference in control traces arises from a different number of channels in each patch and also from the different pressure applied in each case. The rate of adaptation is inversely proportional to the suction (18Koprowski P. Kubalski A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 253-262Google Scholar), and accordingly, the highest rate of adaptation is observed in the control trace of experiment with the lowest suction applied (Fig. 3 B). The previous set of experiments showed that cross-linking of lysines by BS3 on the cytoplasmic side of the closed YggB channel reduces the probability of the channel being open upon application of pressure. An important question, however, arises: which lysines were those involved in the cross-linking preventing the channel from opening. BS3could bind lysines situated within a single C terminus or lysines from C termini of different subunits. Alternatively, Lys60located in the linker between TM1 and TM2 and situated in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1) could be also involved. Cross-linking studies performed with disuccinimidyl suberate showed that lysine-specific cross-linkers react with groups from different subunits (19Sukharev S. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 290-298Google Scholar). We also confirmed this observation using BS3 (a water-soluble analogue of disuccinimidyl suberate). 2P. Koprowski and A. Kubalski, unpublished observation. Therefore, we assumed that cross-linking of lysines from different subunits of the YggB closed channel irreversibly prevented the opening of the channel. However, we wanted to verify this assumption with a different experimental procedure. We noticed that three of all eight lysines of the C terminus are situated within the stretch of the last nine amino acids (Fig. 1 A) (the entire sequence of the C terminus consists of ∼160 amino acids), and accordingly the highest probability of cross-linking occurs in this region. Therefore, we added a His6 tag to the end of the C terminus and studied the effect of Ni2+ binding to their imidazole groups. It was shown previously that the addition of His5 tag to the hemolysin channel renders a channel that could be inhibited by Ni2+ (23Walker B. Braha O. Cheley S. Bayley H. Curr. Biol. 1995; 2: 99-105Google Scholar). It is worthwhile to note at this point that there are no other histidines in the entire amino acid sequence of YggB. We reasoned that, if in the closed state of the YggB-His6 channel its tagged C termini are close enough to coordinate Ni2+, the gating should be altered. This indeed proved to be the case. The response to pressure of the YggB channels was essentially the same whether or not they had the attached C-terminal histidine tag (not shown). Fig. 4 shows the effect of exposure of the YggB-His6 channels to 0.5 and 5 mm NiCl2 at negative pipette voltage (−15 mV). Addition of 0.5 mm Ni2+ reduced the YggB activity (measured as an open probability (P o)) to 89.1% (second trace) and after application of 5 mm Ni2+ the activity decreased to 32.7% (third trace) of that observed in the control (top trace). After removal of Ni2+ with 2 mmEDTA (bottom trace), the YggB activity returned almost to the control level (93% of control). Similar effect was observed in eight other patches, and one of these experiments is presented in Fig.5 (middle trace). In this experiment six concentrations of Ni2+ were used: 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 mm. Each point represents the channel open probability P o at various Ni2+ concentrations normalized to the open probabilityP oc in control. As shown in this figure, at least five recordings of the channel activity were taken at each Ni2+ concentration, and each recording was performed within 1 min after the end of the preceding pressure pulse. The most severe reduction in activity was observed at 1 mmNi2+, and the lowest P o was at 5 and 10 mm Ni2+. In three experiments of similar procedure but at positive pipette voltage (+15 mV), we did not observe this effect, and the data from one of these experiments are presented in Fig. 5 (top trace). Control experiments of identical procedure were performed on the channels without the His6tag (three cases). The activities of these channels were not affected by the addition of Ni2+, and one of the control experiments is shown in Fig. 5 (bottom trace).Figure 5Effects of Ni2+ at various concentrations added to the cytoplasmic side of the YggB-His6 channels at +15 mV and −15 mV.Ni2+ did not affect the channel activities at +15 mV (top plot). The inhibiting effect of Ni2+occurred at −15 mV when applied to the YggB-His6 channels (middle plot) but not to the YggB channels (bottom plot). The channel activities were measured as a ratioP o/P oc whereP o is the open probability andP oc is the open probability in control. Five to six suction pulses were applied at each Ni2+ concentration. The increases in the Ni2+ concentration are marked with increasingly darker shades of gray. The beginning and the end of each trace indicatesP o/P oc in control and after washout, respectively. The suction pulse was kept constant in each experiment, and it was 240 mm Hg in experiments presented in thetop and the middle plot (both experiments were performed on the same membrane patch) and 245 mm Hg in the experiment shown in the bottom plot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We applied the antiHis6 antibodies to three membrane patches containing YggB-His6 channels. We did not observe any inhibiting effect of the antibodies on the channel activities (not shown). Inhibition of channel activities of YggB-His6in the presence of Ni2+ suggested that histidines from different subunits are involved in coordinating Ni2+. We looked, therefore, for confirmation of this hypothesis in vitro. Western blot of YggB-His6 (Fig.6) in the absence of Ni2+ and at 25 °C revealed a ladder pattern of six bands (left panel, first lane) indicated by numbers. Under our conditions of electrophoresis, the lowest band migrated close to the front of the gel. It represents the monomeric polypeptide of 28 kDa. The dimer, trimer, tetramer, pentamer and hexamer are present at 47, 93, 150, 190, and 210 kDa, respectively. The oligomers were stable in SDS buffer at 25 °C. At higher temperatures they dissociated; at 55 °C the bands of monomers, dimers, and trimers are visible, and at 75 °C only the bands of monomers and dimers are visible. Nickel ions bound to YggB-His6 oligomers and the electrophoretic mobility of the resulting complexes was lower than the mobility of the YggB-His6 oligomers present in the absence of Ni2+. At 25 °C all of the bands up to hexamer are well resolved, and the binding seems to be stable from trimer to hexamer. The patterns yielded at 55 °C and at 75 °C are very similar to that observed at 25 °C, indicating that the Ni2+-bound oligomers are stable at higher temperatures. This is in a marked contrast to the YggB oligomers existing in the absence of Ni2+. We used Mg2+ as a control for the effect of Ni2+, and the ladders obtained in the presence of Mg2+ (third lane in each panel) were very similar to the control ones (first lane in eachpanel) at all of the temperatures tested. The amount of fraction applied to each lane was the same; however, in control at room temperature the overall intensity of the bands representing dimers and higher oligomers is higher than in the other lanes. The overall intensity of the bands in the lanes with Ni2+ (normalized to the intensity at room temperature) increases with an increase of temperature (1.0, 2.5, and 3.1), indicating that more protein could enter the gel at higher temperatures as dimers and higher oligomers. In contrast, the higher the temperature the lower the intensity of the bands in the control lanes (1.0, 0.13, and 0.10) and in the lanes with Mg2+ (1.0, 0.38, and 0.47), suggesting that more protein can exist in a monomeric state. The monomeric band migrates at the front of the gel, and an estimation of its intensity is difficult. This explanation applies as well to the apparent difference in intensity between the bands in the presence and in the absence of Ni2+ at room temperature (Fig. 6,first panel, second and first lanes, respectively). The observed stability of the Ni2+-bound oligomers allows us to conclude that histidines from different subunits of YggB-His6 channel participate in Ni2+coordination. An additional confirmation of this conclusion comes from the YggB crystal structure, which revealed that the β strands located at the ends of C termini form a parallel β-barrel (Fig.1 B). The ends of the strands from the β-barrel are in a close proximity, and after addition of His6 epitopes, Ni2+ coordination by histidines from different subunits is very likely to occur. We exposed the C termini of the open YggB-His6 channels to Ni2+, assuming that the Ni2+ coordination between the His6-tagged C termini might not occur. The control experiment was basically similar to that in which we had investigated Ni2+ coordination in the closed YggB-His6 channels, but we introduced a time scale. In this experiment we measured channel activity by a short pressure pulse, and then 5 mm NiCl2 was applied to the closed channels (Fig. 7). After exposure to Ni2+ for 2 min, a second pulse of identical pressure was applied. A change in the channel activities in both pulses was measured as a ratio:I max2/I max1, whereI max1 and I max2 represent peak currents (corresponding to the number of active channels) during the first and the second pulse, respectively. Fewer channels open in response to the second pulse because of the Ni2+coordination and the ratioI max2/I max1 = 0.46 ± 0.01 (n = 3). After washout of the chamber with the bath solution devoid of NiCl2 and with 2 mmEDTA similar two-pulse procedure was performed. The response to both pulses was very similar,I max2/I max1 = 0.99 ± 0.02 (n = 3), and it returned to its initial level. A procedure of similar time scale was used to the open YggB-His6 channels. In this experiment, the first pressure pulse was not released, and 5 mm NiCl2 was applied to the open channels. After ∼3 min the pressure was released, and the second short pulse was applied. The activities during the second pulse were reduced (I max2/I max1 = 0.67 ± 0.13s, n = 5) (Fig. 8,middle trace); however, the degree of the decrease was similar to the control experiment (Fig. 8, top trace), in which no nickel ions were added andI max2/I max1 = 0.67 ± 0.08 (n = 4). This suggests that the decline of activities was due to the lack of recovery of the adapted channels from their inactive state. We found previously that the recovery rate from an inactive state of the YggB channels was 72 and 95% following intervals of 60 and 120 s, respectively (18Koprowski P. Kubalski A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 253-262Google Scholar). In the experiment presented in Fig. 8, the bottom recording was obtained 2 min after the middle recording, and all of the channels were able to recover from their inactive state. Over this time Ni2+ was present in the chamber; however, nickel ions were not coordinated by the closed channels as seen fromI max1 of the lower recording (I max1 from the bottom recording/I max1 from the middle recording = 1.074). We applied additional 5 mmNiCl2; so over the next 2 min the closed channels were exposed to 10 mm NiCl2, and still we did not observe any effect of coordinating Ni2+ by histidines. As shown in Fig. 5, the most severe reduction of the YggB-His6activity occurred at 1 mm Ni2+, suggesting that the large number of nickel ions must be coordinated by many histidines from different subunits to have an effect on the channel activity. Single histidine coordinates nickel ion with a low affinity (millimolar range) (24Sillén L.G. Martell A.E. Stability Constants, Suppl. 1. Alden, Oxford, UK1971Google Scholar); however, nickel ion is coordinated within a stretch of histidines with a high affinity (micromolar range) (25Fu C. Olson J.W. Maier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2333-2337Google Scholar). This implies that in the experiment presented in Fig. 8, nickel ions bound to histidines when the channels were open and probably saturated the imidazole groups within a single histidine tag (with a high affinity), preventing the coordination between subunits (with a low affinity) even after exposing the channels to the high Ni2+concentration.

It is implicated in biologically important processes such as lipoprotein metabolism, neurological function, tissue remodeling, protease complex clearance, and cell signal transduction. However, the regulation of LRP gene expression remains largely unknown. In this study, we have analyzed 2 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the LRP gene and identified a predicted peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) from −1185 to −1173. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) ligands such as fatty acids and rosiglitazone increased functional cell surface LRP by 1.5–2.0-fold in primary human adipocytes and in the SW872 human liposarcoma cell line as assessed by activated α2-macroglobulin binding and degradation. These agents were found to increase LRP transcription. Gel shift analysis of the putative PPRE demonstrated direct binding of PPARγ/retinoid X receptor α heterodimers to the PPRE in the LRP gene. Furthermore, these heterodimers could no longer interact with a mutated PPRE probe. The isolated promoter was functional in SW872 cells, and its activity was increased by 1.5-fold with the addition of rosiglitazone. Furthermore, the isolated response element was similarly responsive to rosiglitazone when placed upstream of an ideal promoter. Mutagenesis of the predicted PPRE abolished the ability of this construct to respond to rosiglitazone. These data demonstrate that fatty acids and rosiglitazone directly stimulate transcription of the LRP gene through activation of PPARγ and increase functional LRP expression.

The isolated promoter was functional in SW872 cells, and its activity was increased by 1.5-fold with the addition of rosiglitazone. Furthermore, the isolated response element was similarly responsive to rosiglitazone when placed upstream of an ideal promoter. Mutagenesis of the predicted PPRE abolished the ability of this construct to respond to rosiglitazone. These data demonstrate that fatty acids and rosiglitazone directly stimulate transcription of the LRP gene through activation of PPARγ and increase functional LRP expression. low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor retinoid X receptor peroxisome proliferator response element fetal calf serum reverse transcription α2-macroglobulin activated α2M electrophoretic mobility shift assay(s) human fatty acyl CoA oxidase phosphate-buffered saline receptor-associated protein bovine serum albumin Hanks' balanced salt solution The α2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)1 is a 600-kDa multifunctional endocytic receptor that belongs to the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family (1Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Google Scholar). LRP binds and internalizes a broad range of biologically diverse ligands. These include proteases of the fibrinolytic pathway (2Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9543-9549Google Scholar) and serpin-enzyme complexes (3Kounnas M.Z. Church F.C. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6523-6529Google Scholar) as well as proteins important in lipoprotein metabolism such as lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase, lipoprotein(a), and apoE-rich lipoproteins (4Chappell D.A.

Targeted deletion of LRP in the mouse results in early embryonic death, demonstrating a critical function for LRP in prenatal development (10Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Google Scholar). LRP has also been shown to have a dual role in ॆ-amyloid metabolism by enhancing ॆ-amyloid precursor protein conversion to ॆ-amyloid (11Ulery P.G. Beers J. Mikhailenko I. Tanzi R.E. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7410-7415Google Scholar) and mediating the clearance of ॆ-amyloid (12Kang D.E. Pietrzik C.U. Baum L. Chevallier N. Merriam D.E. Kounnas M.Z. Wagner S.L. Troncoso J.C. Kawas C.H. Katzman R. Koo E.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1159-1166Google Scholar, 13Shibata M. Yamada S. Kumar S.R. Calero M.

These data support a potentially complex role for LRP in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (14Ulery P.G. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1077-1079Google Scholar). In addition, LRP mediates signal transduction by interacting with cytosolic adaptor and scaffold proteins including DAB-1, JIP-2, and PSD-95 (15Gotthardt M. Trommsdorff M. Nevitt M.F. Shelton J. Richardson J.A. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25616-25624Google Scholar). A 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein that functions intracellularly as a molecular chaperone for LRP and regulates its ligand binding activity (16Battey F.D. Gafvels M.E. FitzGerald D.J. Argraves W.S. Chappell D.A. Strauss J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23268-23273Google Scholar, 17Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L.

RAP is required for the proper folding and export of the LRP from the endoplasmic reticulum by preventing the premature binding of co-expressed ligands, such as apoE (19Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Google Scholar, 20Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J.

RAP binds LRP directly via adjacent complement-type repeats, both containing a conserved acidic residue (22Andersen O.M. Christensen L.L. Christensen P.A. Sorensen E.S. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21017-21024Google Scholar), and thus stearically interferes with binding of other LRP ligands including α2M* and remnant lipoproteins. LRP is expressed in a variety of cells with high expression in hepatocytes, macrophages, neuronal cells, fibroblasts, and adipocytes (23Herz J. Betterridge D.J. Illingworth D.R. Shepherd J. Lipoproteins in Health and Disease. Arnold, London1999: 333-359Google Scholar). In human adipocytes, LRP is involved in chylomicron remnant cholesterol clearance (24Descamps O. Bilheimer D. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 974-981Google Scholar) and mediates the selective uptake of high density lipoprotein-derived cholesteryl ester (25Vassiliou G. Benoist F. Lau P. Kavaslar G.N. McPherson R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48823-48830Google Scholar). Despite the diverse and biologically important functions of LRP, relatively little is known about the regulation of LRP gene expression. The human LRP gene consists of 89 exons spanning 92 kb, encoding an mRNA of 15 kb (26Van Leuven F. Stas L. Hilliker C. Lorent K. Umans L. Serneels L. Overbergh L. Torrekens S. Moechars D. De Strooper B. Genomics. 1994; 24: 78-89Google Scholar). Although the coding regions of LRP and the low density lipoprotein receptor share some homology, there is little apparent similarity in their promoter regions. A portion of the 5′-flanking region of the LRP gene has been previously described (27Kutt H. Herz J. Stanley K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1009: 229-236Google Scholar,28Gaeta B.A. Borthwick I. Stanley K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 307-313Google Scholar). In Chinese hamster ovary cells, the minimal promoter driving expression of the LRP gene was shown to be in a 1.6-kb GC-rich fragment that does not contain a classical TATA box. An Sp1 sequence at −80 and two clusters of Sp1 sequences between −520 and −752 were characterized and shown to be critical for expression of the gene. The promoter region also contains a consensus NRF-1 element located at −152 that may mediate the effects of cAMP and IFNγ (29Gafvels M.E. Coukos G. Sayegh R. Coutifaris C. Strickland D.K. Strauss J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21230-21234Google Scholar, 30Businaro R. Fabrizi C. Persichini T. Starace G. Ennas M.G. Fumagalli L. Lauro G.M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 72: 75-81Google Scholar). There is a consensus sterol response element located at +233 in the 5′-untranslated region; however, studies have shown that LRP gene expression is not regulated by cholesterol (27Kutt H. Herz J. Stanley K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1009: 229-236Google Scholar). We have studied the regulation of LRP gene expression during human preadipocyte differentiation and in response to free fatty acid availability. LRP mRNA was absent in human preadipocytes, and the appearance of LRP mRNA during differentiation coincided with that of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). 2F. Benoist and R. McPherson, unpublished data. PPARγ is a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. The retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) is the obligate partner of PPARγ (31Kersten S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Google Scholar), and together they form a heterodimer that regulates gene transcription following binding to a peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) and activation by specific ligands. The PPRE consists of a hexameric nucleotide repeat of the recognition motif (TGACCT) spaced by one nucleotide (DR-1) (32DiRenzo J. Soderstrom M. Kurokawa R. Ogliastro M.H. Ricote M. Ingrey S. Horlein A. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2166-2176Google Scholar, 33Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 907-925Google Scholar). PPARγ is activated by a number of ligands including long chain fatty acids (34Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Google Scholar), prostaglandin J2 derivatives (35Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Google Scholar), and thiazolidenediones (36Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Google Scholar, 37De Vos P. Lefebvre A.M. Miller S.G. Guerre-Millo M. Wong K. Saladin R. Hamann L.G. Staels B. Briggs M.R. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1004-1009Google Scholar). The effects of PPARγ ligands on gene expression are direct results of increased transcription of the target gene containing a PPRE. In our own analysis of the LRP promoter, we have identified a novel sequence (TGAACTcTGACAT) in the 5′-flanking sequence at positions −1185 to −1173 with high homology to the PPRE. We report here that functional cell surface LRP is increased by PPARγ ligands via the activation of PPARγ transcriptional complexes that bind the newly identified PPRE in the LRP promoter. This is the first report demonstrating regulation of LRP gene expression via a discrete promoter element. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was collected from healthy normolipemic subjects undergoing reduction mammoplasty procedures. Preadipocytes were isolated and cultured from adipose tissue through collagenase digestion, centrifugation, and filtration as previously described (38Benoist F. Lau P. McDonnell M. Doelle H. Milne R. McPherson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23572-23577Google Scholar, 39Radeau T. Robb M. Lau P. Borthwick J. McPherson R. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 369-376Google Scholar, 40Radeau T. Robb M. McDonnell M. McPherson R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1392: 245-253Google Scholar, 41Radeau T. Lau P. Robb M. McDonnell M. Ailhaud G. McPherson R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2552-2561Google Scholar). The preadipocytes were cultured in differentiation media for 10–14 days. The cells were then insulin-starved in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone for 24 h prior to assays. The control cells were treated with vehicle only (Me2SO). The human liposarcoma cell line SW872 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was previously characterized and has been shown to be a good cell model for adipocyte gene expression (42Gauthier B. Robb M. Gaudet F. Ginsburg G.S. McPherson R. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1284-1293Google Scholar, 43Richardson M.A. Berg D.T. Johnston P.A. McClure D. Grinnell B.W. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1162-1166Google Scholar, 44Izem L. Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26534-26541Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (3:1) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 57 fetal bovine serum and 17l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10 mmNaCO3, and 50 ॖg/ml gentamycin (NovoPharm, Toronto, Canada) in the presence of 57 CO2 at 37 °C. Lipoprotein-deficient fetal calf serum was prepared as described previously (45Schumaker V.N. Puppione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-170Google Scholar) and dialyzed against PBS for 24 h. The effect of fatty acids and thiazolidenediones on LRP mRNA and protein levels was determined by incubating cells for 24 h in medium containing either lipoprotein-deficient fetal calf serum or CS in the presence or absence of oleic acid (18:1) or arachidonic acid (20:4) (Sigma) or rosiglitazone (Smith Kline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, PA). All of the conditions were studied in triplicate. SW872 cells were cultured for 24 h with either 160 ॖmarachidonic acid or 500 nm rosiglitazone in media containing CS prior to measuring their ability to degrade125I-labeled α2M* as previously described (46Vassiliou G. Stanley K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15172-15178Google Scholar). Differentiated primary human adipocytes cultured in differentiating medium were starved of insulin in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of rosiglitazone prior to measuring their ability to degrade or bind 125I-α2M* (46Vassiliou G. Stanley K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15172-15178Google Scholar). Control cells were treated with vehicle only (Me2SO). As a further control, the cells were treated in the presence or absence of RAP because this molecule will impair LRP function. To determine the transcriptional effect of rosiglitazone, 500 nm of this ligand was added to cells cultured as described above in the presence or absence of 10 ॖg/ml α-amanitin (Sigma), a potent inhibitor of RNA polymerase II (47Adolph S. Brusselbach S. Muller R. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 113-122Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from both differentiated primary human adipocytes and SW872 cells with Tri-Reagent (Bio/Can, Mississauga, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA samples from differentiated primary adipocytes that were to be used in RT-PCR reactions were treated with amplification grade DNase I to deplete the samples of any DNA contamination according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically usingA260/280. Total RNA (5 ॖg) was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis using the NorthernMax-Gly kit and transferred to BrightStar-Plus nylon membrane according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion, Austin, TX). DNA probes were synthesized by RT-PCR; first strand DNA was synthesized as described below, and PCR was performed using the following primers: LRPf, 5′-GAGTACCAGGTCCTGTACATCGCTG-3′, and LRPr, 5′-CTCGTCAATCATGCCCGAGATGAGC-3′; ॆ-actin-f, 5′-GCCCCTCCATCGTCCACCGC-3′, and ॆ-actin-r, 5′-GGGCACGAAGGCTCATCATT-3′. The PCR products were gel-purified using the QiaexII kit (Qiagen), and the purified DNA was subsequently labeled using the Rediprime II random prime labeling kit according the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The probes were cleaned up with NICK columns (Amersham Biosciences), and the specific activity was determined by use of a scintillation counter. Hybridizations and washes were performed according the NorthernMax-Gly kit instructions (Ambion). RT-PCR was performed using a two-step approach. First strand cDNA was synthesized using 2.5 ॖg of total RNA, 10 ॖm random decamer primers (Ambion), and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. Consecutive PCR reactions were then performed on the first strand cDNA using the primers shown below and the SYBR green 舠taq-start舡 polymerase and the LightCycler Apparatus according the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The data from the LightCycler was repeated using relative quantitative RT-PCR as described below. For SW 872 samples, relative quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the Quantum RNA 18 S Internal Standards kit from Ambion. This kit has been previously shown to allow the accurate determination of relative changes in gene expression between samples (48Dodd F. Limoges M. Boudreau R.T. Rowden G. Murphy P.R. Too C.K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 624-634Google Scholar). Briefly, first strand cDNA was synthesized using 2.5 ॖg of total RNA, 10 ॖm random decamer primers (Ambion), and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. LRP forward primer (5′-GAGTACCAGGTCCTGTACATCGCTG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTCGTCAATCATGCCCGAGATGAGC-3′) were designed to amplify a region of the LRP mRNA that is ∼400 bp in size, whereas the primers provided in the 18 S Internal Standards kit produced a band that is ∼500 bp. A cycle number of 23 was determined to be within the linear range of PCR and was used for all subsequent PCR reactions. The 18 S primer:competimer ratio of 3:7 was experimentally determined so that the LRP and 18 S PCR products were amplified to give similar yields so that they could be compared between samples. PCR was performed on 1 ॖl of the RT reaction using 20 pmol of each LRP primer and 4 ॖl of 18 S primer/competitor mix with the following PCR conditions; 1 cycle of 95 °C for 3 min and 23 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 66 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Cocktails containing all shared components were used to reduce variation between samples. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis through a 1.57 agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. The band intensities were measured using the ChemiDoc apparatus and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Relative intensity was calculated by dividing the 400-bp band corresponding to the LRP message by the 488-bp band corresponding to the 18 S message. The cells were cultured on 35-mm cover glass bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) as described above and supplemented with 160 ॖm arachidonic acid, 500 nm rosiglitazone, or control. α2M was activated by incubating purified α2M with 400 mm methylamine for 16 h at room temperature. α2M* was fluorescently labeled using Cy3 monofunctional reactive dye (Amersham Biosciences) to a dye:protein ratio of 1.3 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were placed on ice for 1 h in 3:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplement with 2 mg/ml BSA buffered with 10 mm HEPES. Labeled α2M* was diluted in the same medium to a concentration of 1 ॖg/ml and was added to the cells at 0 °C for 45 min. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS three times prior to being fixed with 47 paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 0 °C. The cells were rinsed with PBS and kept in 2 ml of PBS at room temperature for fluorescence microscopy. Binding was competed with 30-fold excess of unlabelled α2M*. The cells were viewed with an Olympus IX50 fluorescent microscope, and the images were taken using a coded CCD camera (MicroMax) and WinView software from Princeton Instruments (Princeton, NJ). Total cellular protein (5 ॖg) from SW872 cells incubated in the presence or absence of various PPARγ ligands was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose (49Hames B.D. Hames B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1981: 1-86Google Scholar). The LRP was detected (49Hames B.D. Hames B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1981: 1-86Google Scholar) using a polyclonal rabbit antisera (from Dr. G. Bu) followed by chemiluminescent detection (Pierce) of a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The blot was developed, and the bands were quantified using the ChemiDoc apparatus and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Triplicate cell samples were processed and are summarized in the graph. Molecular biology techniques were essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The nuclear proteins were extracted from SW872 cells as previously described (51Slomiany B.A. Kelly M.M. Kurtz D.T. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 938-942Google Scholar) or from primary human adipocytes as described (52Dugail I. Ailhaud G. Adipose Tissue Protocols. Humana Press, Totawa, NJ2001: 141-147Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein reagent (BioLynx, Brockville, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Double-stranded oligonucleotides (oligomers) corresponding to the PPRE of LRP (5′-CCCCGCTCCTTGAACTCTGACATCGAGACACCTA-3′) were radioactively end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and purified from unincorporated nucleotides by gel filtration through G-50 spin columns (Amersham Biosciences). The same procedure was used for oligomers corresponding to the PPRE of the human fatty acyl CoA oxidase gene (hACOX) (5′-TCCGAACGTGACCTTTGTCCTGGTCCCCTTT-3′) and oligomers corresponding to the mutated form of the LRP PPRE (the mutated half-site is underlined) (5′-CCCCGCTCCTTGAACTCAACGATCGAGACACC TA-3′). The specific activities of the oligomers were ∼250 cpm/fmol. These were diluted to 60 fmol/ॖl for use in the assay. PPARγ (from Dr. Bruce Spiegelman) was subcloned into the MluI andNotI sites of pSPORT1 (Invitrogen) using PCR-based methods. RXRα was provided by Dr. Michael Saunders in pSG5. Both constructs are driven by the T7 RNA polymerase promoter for use in the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) for in vitrotranscription/translation. All of the EMSA reactions were carried out on ice in 20 ॖl of binding buffer (12.5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 6 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm KCl) supplemented with 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.25 ॖg of low fat milk, 0.05 ॖg of poly(dI-dC), and 107 glycerol. For EMSA reactions with TNT-purified proteins, 2 ॖl of the TNT reaction was added to the reaction mix along with 1 ॖl (60 fmol) of labeled oligomers. For EMSA reactions with nuclear protein extracts, 6 ॖl of nuclear extracts were added to the reaction mix with 1 ॖl (60 fmol) of labeled oligomers. These reactions were left on ice for 20 min. Following the 20-min incubation, 2 ॖl of 207 Ficoll was added to the samples. DNA-protein complexes were then resolved by electrophoresis through 67 polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× Tris borate running buffer (20 mm Tris borate, pH 7.2, 0.5 mm EDTA). Supershift assays were performed using the PPARγ NuShift kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Active Motif). The nonspecific antibody used was mouse monoclonal anti-ॆ-actin (Santa-Cruz). Complementary primers with flanking NheI and XhoI restriction sites (5′-CTAGCCTCCTTGAACTCTGACATGCAGACC-3′) were annealed and subcloned into the luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Promoter (Promega). This new vector contains a single copy of the putative PPRE upstream of an ideal promoter and is designated pGL3-PPRE. We also prepared 1.9 kb of the 5′-flanking region of LRP by PCR amplification from the LRP-BAC construct prepared by Dr. Jan Boren (53Boren J. Lee I. Callow M.J. Rubin E.M. Innerarity T.L. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 1123-1130Google Scholar), which contains the entire 92-kb gene of human LRP, using the primers 5′-GCAACGAGCTCCGTAAAAGGGGGAAG-3′ and 5′-GCAGCAGATCTTTCCCCGGACTGAAG-3′. This fragment was subcloned into theSacI and BglII sites of the luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Basic (Promega), and designated pGL3-LRP. Mutagenesis of the PPRE was performed by PCR using PFUTurbo (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to their Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis protocol. The complementary primers (5′-CCCGCTCCTTGAACTCAACGATGCAGACACC-3′) were designed to mutate a single half-site of the PPRE so that PPARγ would no longer bind the response element (mutated nucleotides are underlined). This construct was designated pGL3- LRPmutant PPRE. Both pGL3-LRP and pGL3-LRPmutant PPRE were sequenced to confirm that the promoter sequence was correct (compared with GenBankTM accession number Y18524) and to verify the mutagenesis. Confluent SW872 cells were trypsinized and seeded at a density of 1.25 × 105cells/well in 12-well plates 48 h prior to transfection. The cells were ∼70–807 confluent at the time of transfection. Fresh medium containing CS was added 12 h preceding transfections. The cells were co-transfected with 4 ॖg of the firefly luciferase reporter vector (either pGL3-basic, pGL3-LRP, PGL3-PPRE, or pGL3-LRPmutant PPRE) and 0.25 ॖg of theRenilla luciferase-bearing reporter vector, pRL-CMV (Promega) using the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate method (54Blackhart B.D. Yao Z.M. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8358-8360Google Scholar). The cells were shocked with 157 glycerol for 2 min, 4 h after the transfection, and washed three times with PBS before the addition of medium. The cells were treated 12 h later with Me2SO alone (vehicle control) or varying concentrations of rosiglitazone. After 24 h (36 h total post-transfection) the cells were scraped in 250 ॖl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and kept on ice until assayed. Luciferase activities derived from both firefly (LRP constructs) andRenilla (pRL-CMV) proteins were measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and recorded using a Monolight 2010c luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI). Renilla luciferase activity was then used to standardize for transfection efficiency. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Where indicated, the statistical significance of the differences between groups was determined using Student's ttest or analysis of variance. The effects of PPARγ ligands on differentiated primary human adipocytes were examined by an 125I-α2M* binding assay (Fig. 1A). TheBmax of cells incubated with 1 ॖmrosiglitazone (27.0) is ∼1.5 times greater than that of the vehicle-treated cells (17.3), indicating that there is an increase in the levels of functional cell surface LRP. The difference in binding was found to be highly significant with a two-tailed p value of less than 0.0001. When the cells were treated with RAP (30 ॖg/ml), the amount of binding was reduced to background levels, demonstrating that this process is LRP-specific. There was no statistically significant difference in the Kd between the treated and control cells as illustrated in the Scatchard plot (Fig.1B), indicating that the binding affinities have not changed. 125I-α2M* degradation assays were also performed in the presence or absence of PPARγ ligands for the differentiated primary human adipocytes and SW872 cells. In primary adipocytes, there was a direct relationship between the amount of rosiglitazone added and the amount of α2M* degradation over 8 h (Fig.2A) with very significant increases ranging from 1.2- to 1.7-fold over control (p< 0.009). The RAP is an antagonist of all identified LRP ligands including α2M*; therefore we used purified RAP to block LRP function in our assays. When cells were treated with RAP, the amou"

The association of Trio with the Lar tyrosine phosphatase led us to study the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in Trio function using focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The Lar-interacting domain of Trio is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated when expressed in COS-7 cells and was highly phosphorylated when it was co-transfected with FAK. Co-precipitation studies indicated that Trio binds to the FAK amino-terminal domain and to the FAK kinase domain via its SH3 and kinase domains, respectively. Tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK and Trio were present mainly in the detergent-insoluble fraction of cell lysates, and co-expression of Trio and FAK resulted in increased amounts of Trio present in the detergent-insoluble fraction. Immunofluorescence of cells co-transfected with FAK and Trio revealed significant co-localization of the proteins at the cell periphery, indicating that they form a stable complex in vivo. A FAK phosphorylation site, tyrosine residue 2737, was identified in subdomain I of the Trio kinase domain. Additionally, in vitro phosphorylation assays and in vivo co-expression studies indicated that Trio enhances FAK kinase activity.

Trio is a large and complex protein containing two functional DH GEF domains, which activate Rho-type GTPases, a protein serine/threonine kinase domain, two SH3-like domains, an Ig-like domain, and multiple spectrin-like repeats (7Debant A.

Trio and other DH GEF family members function to activate Rho GTPases such as RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. Once activated, Rho GTPases function in diverse cellular processes including actin cytoskeleton organization, mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade signaling, and gene transcription (8Bishop A.L.

This interaction is promoted by Trio carboxyl-terminal GEF domain activity and leads to changes in cell morphology and in the subcellular localization of Trio and RhoA. The regulation of DH GEFs is incompletely understood, but PH domain-mediated interactions with phospholipids or proteins, phosphorylation of DH GEF proteins, or interactions of DH GEFs with other GTPases may be involved (14Kubiseski T.J.

The FAK (focal adhesion kinase) protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) is activated following integrin binding of extracellular matrix and likely plays a key role in integrin-mediated regulation of cell growth and survival, as well as in the control of cell spreading and migration. For instance, FAK-deficient mouse embryonic mesodermal cells (19Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T.

Cas and paxillin are involved in coordinating integrin-mediated regulation of cell proliferation and migration (31Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J.

The role of FAK in cell spreading and migration appears to be mediated at least in part via Cas and paxillin phosphorylation. For example, increased cell migration associated with ectopic FAK expression depends on FAK kinase activity and an intact Cas-binding site in FAK (20Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that FAK binds Trio and phosphorylates Trio near the ATP-binding site in its kinase domain and that Trio and FAK co-localize in vivo at the cell periphery. Finally, Trio activates FAK autophosphorylation in vitro and in vivo, indicating that FAK and Trio comprise a novel bi-directional signaling complex. Trio expression constructs were made using standard techniques and confirmed by restriction mapping and, in some cases, DNA sequencing. Trio cDNA constructs were cloned into the pMT.HAtag or pMT.Myctag expression vectors, which encode either a hemagglutinin (HA) or Myc epitope tag sequence immediately upstream of the cloning site. The extent of the Trio regions encoded by these plasmids are schematically shown in Fig. 1. Amino acid numbering of Trio is according to a full-length Trio of 3,038 amino acids (GenBankTM accession number UF091395). Trio.SIKD refers to amino acids 2485–3038 with the a catalytically inactive kinase domain caused by a K2756A mutation, and Trio.KT refers to amino acids 2730–2994. The following constructs were used for FAK in the pMT3 vector: FAK.ΔN (amino acids 384–1052), FAK.K (amino acids 384–706), FAK.KD (amino acids 384–706, K454R), and FAK.ΔNK (amino acids 707–1052). COS-7 cell transient transfections were done by the DEAE-dextran/Me2SO method using ∼2 μg of plasmid DNA/2 × 105 cells, and the cells were harvested ∼20 h after transfection. The proteins were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine during the final 4 h prior to harvesting of cells. HeLa cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation and fixed and stained 3 days after transfection as described previously (13Medley Q.G. Serra-Pages C. Iannotti E. Seipel K. Tang M. O'Brien S.P. Streuli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36116-36123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cell proteins were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine essentially as previously described (33Serra-Pages C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Following labeling, the cells were washed in PBS, lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation of soluble protein. The cell lysates were then precleared once with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1–2 h. For immunoprecipitations 1 μl of anti-HA mAb 12CA5 ascites fluid and 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose were added per ml of precleared lysate for 1 h. The precipitates were then washed with buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mmMgCl2. The precipitated proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by autoradiography. The proteins from cell lysates or co-precipitated proteins from nonlabeled cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the immunoblots were probed with the anti-HA mAb HA 11 (BabCO, Richmond, CA) or the anti-GST mAb 112 (ImmunoGen, Cambridge, MA). The immunoblots were developed with rabbit anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and exposed to film using the chemiluminescence reagent, luminol, essentially as described by the supplier (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The immunoblots were quantitated from scanned films using Un-Scan-It gel digitizing software from Silk Scientific, Inc. (Orem, UT). For experiments in which the detergent-insoluble (P) or detergent-soluble (S) fractions were used, the cells were lysed as above, and the pellet and supernatant from the 16,000 × g centrifugation step were boiled in equal volumes of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The tryptic peptide maps were performed as described previously (34Medley Q.G. Kedersha N. O'Brien S. Tian Q. Schlossman S.F. Streuli M. Anderson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled protein was excised from dried gels, hydrated, washed in MeOH to remove SDS, and digested 2 days with 0.1 mg/ml trypsin in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The liberated peptides were dried and separated by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 in acetic acid/formic acid/water (8:2:90) for 45 min at 800 V and by ascending chromatography in 1-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/water (37.5:25:7.5:30). HeLa cells were rinsed in PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min, and then permeabilized for 10 min in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS containing 2% horse serum. Nonspecific antibody-binding sites were blocked by a 30-min incubation in blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum in PBS). To detect HA-Trio and Myc-FAK, the permeabilized cells were exposed to the anti-HA mAb HA 11 and anti-Myc for 1 h and washed, and then the primary antibodies were detected with a 30-min treatment of Texas Red-linked goat anti-mouse IgG2a (Southern Biotech) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-linked goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Southern Biotech). Slides were mounted in a polyvinyl alcohol medium and viewed on a Nikon E800 microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Trio was identified by virtue of its ability to interact with the LAR protein-tyrosine phosphatase through its carboxyl-terminal Ig-like domain and kinase domain. Because Trio interacts with LAR and thus could be expected to be a candidate LAR substrate, we tested whether Trio was tyrosine-phosphorylated. Immunoblot analysis showed tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Trio precipitated from HeLa cells treated with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate, indicating that Trio is a substrate for tyrosine kinases in vivo (data not shown). To map the site(s) of Trio tyrosine phosphorylation, we initially expressed constructs encoding various regions of Trio (schematically shown in Fig.1A): the amino-terminal spectrin repeats (HA-Trio.SP), the two GEF domains (HA-Trio.G1 and HA-Trio.G2S), the second GEF domain through to carboxyl terminus (HA-Trio.GSIK), and the carboxyl-terminal region of Trio containing the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain, Ig-like domain, and kinase domain (HA-Trio.SIK). When expressed in COS-7 cells, all of the Trio subregions partitioned to the detergent-soluble fraction except the HA-Trio.SIK, which partitioned to both the detergent-soluble (S) and -insoluble fractions (P) (Fig.1B). Immunoblotting of the detergent-soluble and -insoluble pellet fractions using an anti-Tyr(P)-specific mAb indicated that Trio.SIK, the Lar-binding portion of Trio, was the only region of Trio undergoing significant levels of tyrosine phosphorylation and that tyrosine-phosphorylated Trio.SIK was almost exclusively localized to the insoluble fraction (Fig. 1B). Expression of either the Trio SH3, Ig-like, or kinase domains alone indicated that the kinase domain was responsible for localization to the Triton-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction (Fig. 2Aand data not shown). Several properties of the focal adhesion kinase FAK were consistent with it mediating the Trio phosphorylation observed in COS-7 cells. Like the Trio constructs, the majority of the tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK in transiently transfected COS-7 cells is present in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 2A). Immunoblot analysis of COS-7 cell lysates also indicated that the FAK in the insoluble fraction was reactive with antibodies specific for the FAK Tyr-397 phosphorylation site (data not shown), which is the major FAK autophosphorylation site (25Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 35Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1994; 5: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The similar localization of Trio and active autophosphorylated FAK suggested that FAK may phosphorylate Trio. To test the phosphorylation of Trio by FAK, the Trio constructs HA-Trio.SIK, HA-Trio.SI, HA-Trio.K, and HA-Trio.GSIK (Fig.1A) were all co-expressed with HA-FAK in COS-7 cells (Fig.2, A and B). The cell extracts were prepared, and the detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that in the presence of FAK, all of the Trio constructs present in the insoluble pellet fraction displayed shifts to lower mobility forms, consistent with increased tyrosine-phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and B). Additionally, in the presence of FAK, there was increased partitioning of the Trio constructs to the detergent-insoluble fraction of the lysates, especially evident with the Trio.GSIK (Fig. 2B), suggesting that FAK can regulate Trio localization. The HA-Trio.GSIK, HA-Trio.SIK, HA-Trio.SI, and HA-Trio.K constructs in the insoluble fraction of COS-7 lysates were subsequently found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated, and the constructs containing the Trio kinase domain were more highly phosphorylated (Fig.2 and data not shown). There was no observed phosphorylation of Trio constructs when co-expressed with FAK containing a kinase catalytic mutation (data not shown). The FAK autophosphorylation site Tyr-397 has been shown to recruit and bind the Src PTK, forming a complex between these two active tyrosine kinases (27Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D.

Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). However, Trio constructs were also phosphorylated by the HA-FAKY397Fconstruct in which the Src-binding site is mutated, suggesting that Trio phosphorylation is mediated by FAK and not by Src that is associated with FAK (Fig. 2A). Co-transfection of Trio.SIK and FAK in HeLa cells also demonstrated preferential localization of tyrosine-phosphorylated Trio.SIK to the insoluble fraction of cell lysates (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that there are at least two sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in Trio: the SI region and the kinase domain. Using the Trio kinase domain as substrate, we identified by mutational analysis which amino acid residue was predominantly phosphorylated by FAK (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Trio constructs in which tyrosine residues were mutated to phenylalanine were co-transfected with HA-FAK in COS-7 cells, and the soluble (S) and insoluble (P) fractions of the lysate were subjected to immunoblotting analysis. Mutation of Trio Tyr-2737 to phenylalanine (Y2737F) resulted in elimination of the majority of the tyrosine phosphorylation of the Trio kinase domain by FAK (Fig. 2C). The identification of one main phosphorylation site in the kinase domain indicates that the phosphorylation of Trio by FAK is relatively specific. To determine whether Trio binds FAK, we performed co-precipitation studies using cell lysates from COS-7 cells expressing HA-tagged FAK constructs (shown schematically in Fig.3A) and GST-tagged Trio constructs. The cells were lysed, the soluble proteins precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose, and immunoblotting analysis was performed to identify co-precipitating FAK constructs. Whereas no FAK constructs shown in Fig. 3A bound to GST expressed alone (data not shown), the GST-Trio.SIK and GST-Trio.K constructs both bound the catalytically inactive FAK kinase domain construct (FAK.KD) and Trio.K also bound active FAK.K kinase domain (Fig. 3B), indicating that the kinase domains of FAK and Trio interact. The increased affinity of the FAK kinase mutant (FAK.KD) for Trio as compared with the active FAK kinase may be further evidence that Trio is a substrate of FAK. GST-Trio.SI bound full-length FAK efficiently, but the removal of the amino-terminal portion of FAK (HA-FAK. ΔN) greatly reduced Trio binding, suggesting that Trio.SI bound to this region of FAK. Taken together, these results indicate that Trio binds FAK in two distinct regions: the FAK amino-terminal portion via the SH3-Ig-like region and the FAK kinase domain via the kinase domain. To determine the subcellular localization of the FAK-Trio complex in cells, HA-Trio.GSIK and Myc-FAK were expressed either alone or together in HeLa cells and then Trio (Fig. 4, red) or FAK (Fig. 4,green) localization was determined by immunofluorescence staining. When expressed alone, both Trio.GSIK and FAK are generally expressed throughout the cell with an increase at the cell edges (Fig.4, A and B). Co-expressed Trio.GSIK and FAK were also enriched at the cell periphery where they displayed a high degree of co-localization (Fig. 4, C and D, seearrows). In summary, our results indicate that Trio is phosphorylated by FAK, binds FAK through its SH3/Ig region and kinase domain, and co-localizes with FAK at the cell periphery. The interaction of the Trio and FAK kinase domains suggested that, in addition to being a FAK substrate, Trio may also regulate FAK kinase activity. To test this hypothesis, we assayed in vitro equal amounts of immunoprecipitated FAK kinase domain in the presence of either purified GST or purified GST-tagged Trio kinase domain (GST-KT). The GST and GST-KT proteins were expressed in COS-7 cells, precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose, eluted with free glutathione, and assayed with the FAK kinase domain in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. FAK kinase domain phosphorylation was increased 2.5-fold when assayed in the presence of active Trio kinase domain (GST-Trio.KT) compared with its activity with GST (Fig. 5A) or with GST-Tara, a Trio-binding protein (38Seipel K. O'Brien S.P. Iannotti E. Medley Q.G. Streuli M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 389-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that the majority of the phosphorylation was on tyrosine (data not shown), suggesting that the Trio kinase domain increases FAK kinase domain autophosphorylation. Phosphopeptide mapping analysis of the FAK.K assayed with GST or GST-Trio.KT revealed that the same phosphopeptides were present (Fig. 5B, labeled A–F), although the relative amount of the major phosphopeptide A was increased in the presence of Trio. Based upon its relative position, peptide A is probably the tryptic peptide containing Tyr-397 (28Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase assays of kinase-inactive FAK (Myc-FAK.KD) with Trio.KT resulted in limited FAK phosphorylation, indicating that Trio did not significantly phosphorylate the FAK kinase domain in vitro (Fig. 5A). We next examined thein vivo phosphorylation of HA-FAK that was transiently expressed with the HA-Trio.SIK construct in COS-7 cells (Fig.5C). Lysates of the cells were prepared, and the levels of protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation were determined by immunoblot analysis. Relative to its expression levels, FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was 2.5-fold greater in the presence of kinase-active Trio.SIK as compared with FAK expressed alone, whereas FAK co-expressed with kinase-inactive Trio.SIKD had phosphotyrosine levels that were decreased 50%. No tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was observed when the FAK kinase catalytic mutant was expressed, suggesting that the observed tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was a result of autophosphorylation. These results suggest that Trio activates FAK autophosphorylation and may regulate FAK activity in vivo. We provide evidence that the FAK PTK and the Trio S/TK interact and possibly regulate one another. FAK and Trio have two binding sites for each other; both proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated in the detergent-insoluble fraction of cell lysates, and both proteins co-localize at the cell periphery in vivo. FAK phosphorylates Trio tyrosine residue 2737, which is near the Trio kinase ATP-binding site, suggesting that FAK-mediated tyrosine of Trio may serve to regulate Trio kinase activity. Additionally, Trio increased the FAK PTK activity in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that bi-directional regulation occurs between Trio and FAK. Tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK and Trio are strongly enriched in the detergent-insoluble fraction, and the insolubility of Trio is increased when it is co-expressed with FAK. We have mapped two separate sites of interaction between FAK and Trio on each protein, and it is possible that Trio becomes preferentially associated with active FAK in vivo. FAK may therefore regulate the localization of Trio in the cell and affect its interaction with potential kinase or GEF substrates. Recent work suggests that Trio regulates neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (39Estrach S. Schmidt S. Diriong S. Penna A. Blangy A. Fort P. Debant A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 307-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), possibly in a pathway triggered by NGF, and Pyk2 and FAK have been shown to be involved with neurite formation in PC12 cells (40Ivankovic-Dikic I. Gronroos E. Blaukat A. Barth B.U. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Recently FAK has also been shown to phosphorylate and activate the guanine exchange factors PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG (41Chikumi H. Vazquez-Prado J. Servitja J.M. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The amount of FAK associated with the Triton-insoluble fraction of cells was previously shown to increase upon integrin cross-linking (42Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5501-5509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the specific activity of FAK in the insoluble fraction was enhanced compared with the FAK in the soluble fraction (43Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Furthermore, endogenous FAK in Schwann cells lysates localized to the detergent-insoluble fraction, forming a complex with β1-integrin and paxillin (44Chen L.M. Bailey D. Fernandez-Valle C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3776-3784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with latrunculin A, which promotes actin filament disassembly and inhibitsde novo formation of filaments, had no effect on the association of FAK and Trio with the detergent-insoluble fraction (data not shown), suggesting either that phosphorylated FAK and Trio are not associated with the actin cytoskeleton or that they bind to stabilized actin filaments. Similarly, treatment of Schwann cells with the actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D did not disassemble the insoluble complex that bound FAK but rather increased the amount of FAK in the insoluble fraction (44Chen L.M. Bailey D. Fernandez-Valle C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3776-3784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, death-associated protein kinase (DAP kinase) and Duet have kinase domains that are highly homologous to the Trio kinase domain and were also reported to partition to the detergent-insoluble fraction (45Kawai T. Sanjo H. Akira S. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 227: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 46Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). It is possible that DAP kinase and Duet share a common binding protein or substrate with Trio. Tyr-2737 of Trio was identified as the main phosphorylation site when the Trio kinase domain was co-expressed with FAK. This site is in subdomain I of the Trio kinase domain and near the ATP-binding site. This phosphorylation site location suggests a possible mechanism for the regulation of Trio kinase activity by FAK, although experiments to delineate more precisely any regulation of Trio kinase activity by FAK are necessary. This phosphorylation site is conserved among many protein kinases, including those similar to Trio such as Duet (45Kawai T. Sanjo H. Akira S. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 227: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), Zip (47Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and DAP (48Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) as well as other kinases such as calmodulin KII, Polo kinase, and casein kinase I (49Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). Lar and liprin-α1 were shown to localize to the distal ends of focal adhesions (33Serra-Pages C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and FAK-Trio complexes may also be involved in directing LAR to focal complexes. An obvious role for Lar would be the dephosphorylation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins at focal adhesions. Indeed, in vitro assays of homogenized preparations of the detergent-insoluble fraction of cells containing tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK and Trio indicated that recombinant Lar can dephosphorylate both proteins (data not shown). These results further implicate Lar as a potential regulator of focal adhesion turnover or formation. Our experiments indicate that Trio can regulate FAK activity in vitro and in vivo. The Trio kinase domain binds co-transfected FAK kinase domain and is phosphorylated by FAK, indicating that there is a direct interaction between the kinase domains of FAK and Trio. Moreover, in in vitro kinase assays, the FAK kinase domain displayed increased autophosphorylation activity in the presence of the Trio kinase domain. It is possible that the binding of Trio induces the FAK kinase domain to adopt a more active conformation. The co-expression of kinase-active Trio.SIK with FAK in COS-7 cells also resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. A kinase-dead FAK construct was not phosphorylated, suggesting that the increase in FAK phosphorylation was a result of autophosphorylation. FAK autophosphorylation occurs mainly at Tyr-397, which recruits Src, leading to further phosphorylation at Tyr-566 and Tyr-567 of the FAK kinase domain, ultimately increasing FAK activity (27Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 28Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The inability of kinase-dead Trio.SIKD to activate FAK autophosphorylation indicates a possible role for Trio kinase activity in the regulation of FAK. Although little phosphorylation of the FAK kinase domain by Trio was seen in vitro, it is possible that Trio phosphorylates FAK in another region. Previously, the focal adhesion targeting domain of FAK was shown to be serine-phosphorylated during mitosis, altering its interaction with Cas (50Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Yamashiro S. Fry D. Zhang X. Hanks S.K. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 51Ma A. Richardson A. Schaefer E.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In summary, FAK and Trio bind each other through multiple domains and co-localize in cells. In addition, Trio activates FAK autophosphorylation and is a substrate for FAK. Overall, the interaction between FAK and Trio suggests possible new mechanisms by which focal adhesion dynamics and cell motility are regulated. We thank Drs. Haruo Saito and Vladimir Reiser for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2028182724,"Heterologous desensitization of chemokine receptors by opioids has been considered to contribute to their immunosuppressive effects. Previous studies show that Met-enkephalin, an endogenous opioid, down-regulates chemotaxis of selected chemokine receptors via phosphorylation. In the present study, we further investigated the molecular mechanism of such cross-regulation. Our data showed that preincubation with Met-enkephalin inhibited both MIP-1α-mediated chemotaxis and Ca2+ flux of monocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effects were maximal using nanomolar concentrations of activating chemokines, a concentration found in physiological conditions. A decrease both in chemokine receptor affinity and in coupling efficiency between receptors and G protein were observed, which directly contributed to the desensitization effects. However, comparing with chemokines such as MIP-1α and MCP-1, opioids did not elicit a calcium flux, failed to induce MIP-1α receptors internalization, and mediated a less potent heterologous desensitization. We hypothesized that these differences might originate from the involvement of different protein kinase C (PKC) isotypes. In our studies, opioid-mediated down-regulation of MIP-1α receptors could be blocked by the general PKC inhibitor calphostin C, but not by the calcium-dependent classic PKC inhibitor Go6976. Western blotting analysis and immunofluorescent staining further showed that only calcium-independent PKCs were activated upon opioid stimulation. Thus, opioids achieve desensitization of chemokine receptors via a unique pathway, involving only calcium-independent PKC isotypes.

The fact that accelerated human immunodeficiency virus pathogenesis occurred in patients who abuse heroin is consistent with the immunosuppressive activity of the opioids (6Donahoe R.M. Falek A. Adv. Biochem. Psychopharmacol. 1988; 44: 145-158PubMed Google Scholar). Although previous studies indicate that opioids may regulate immune responses through their action on central nervous system or sympathetic nervous system, the discovery of opioid receptors on peripheral blood mononuclear cells suggested that these opioid receptors could directly modify the response of proinflammatory receptors (2Taub D.D., E.T.

Data from knock-out mice and in vitro studies suggest that such suppression is mediated largely by μ, δ, and κ opioid receptors. Opioids receptors, members of the seven-transmembrane receptor family, perform their function by coupling to heterotrimeric Gi/o proteins. Their activation leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by Gα, inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels, and activation of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+channels by Gβγ. In cells expressing multiple G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),1 prolonged activation of one receptor has been shown to result in the down-regulation of other GPCR through a process called heterologous desensitization. Accumulating data have demonstrated that heterologous down-regulation of GPCR is mediated by protein kinase A and protein kinase C (PKC) (8Ali H. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 9Richmond A, M.S. White J.R. Schraw W.

Calcium flux, a potent activator of PKC, has been considered essential for heterologous desensitization of chemokine receptors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (8Ali H. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 9Richmond A, M.S. White J.R. Schraw W.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10439-10448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interaction of chemokine receptors with their ligands activates Giproteins, induces the production of DAG, and releases Ca2+, followed by activation and translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane. This process is associated with desensitization of other GPCRs in the same cell by phosphorylation of their consensus sites (10Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10439-10448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Mueller S.G. White J.R. Schraw W.P. Lam V. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8207-8214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The family of PKC consists of more than 12 isozymes, and each of them exhibits a unique pattern of tissue distribution, subcellular translocation, and function (14Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). For instance, PKCζ is essential in mediating neutrophil chemotaxis and in regulating the polarity of astrocytes during wound healing process (15Laudanna C. Mochly-Rosen D. Liron T. Constantin G. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30306-30315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 16Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Cell. 2001; 106: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). PKCθ is predominantly expressed in lymphocytes and is recruited to the membrane during antigen presentation to T-cells (17Meller N. Elitzur Y. Isakov N. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 193: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The 12 PKC isozymes can be divided into three subfamilies: classical PKCs (cPKCs), such as α, βI, βII, and γ, require both Ca2+ and DAG for activation; novel PKCs (nPKCs), such as δ, ε, θ, and η, are DAG-dependent but Ca2+-independent; and atypical PKCs, such as ζ and λ, require neither Ca2+ or DAG. Eight PKC isozymes, α, β1, β2, δ, ε, η, μ, and ζ, have been identified in human blood monocytes (18Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Gudmundsson G. Geist L.J. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L389-L397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, their contribution to heterologous desensitization of chemokine receptors has not been defined. Preincubation with μ- or δ-opioid agonists has been shown to inhibit MIP-1α-mediated chemotaxis of monocytes and neutrophils (7Grimm M.C. Ben-Baruch A. Taub D.D. Howard O.M. Resau J.H. Wang J.M. Ali H. Richardson R. Snyderman R. Oppenheim J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar,21Grimm M.C. Ben-Baruch A. Taub D.D. Howard O.M. Wang J.M. Oppenheim J.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 840: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Such inhibition can be blocked by the nonselective opioid antagonist naxolone or the μ- or δ-selective antagonists CTOP and naltrindole (7Grimm M.C. Ben-Baruch A. Taub D.D. Howard O.M. Resau J.H. Wang J.M. Ali H. Richardson R. Snyderman R. Oppenheim J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Preincubation with opioids has been shown to enhance phosphorylation of CXCR1, correlating with modest impairment of chemotaxis. Compared with other chemokines, opioids are less capable of mediating heterologous desensitization. Heterologous desensitization of chemokine receptors seems to follow a hierarchy; certain receptors are more potent in desensitizing than others (19Tomhave E.D. Richardson R.M. Didsbury J.R. Menard L. Snyderman R. Ali H. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3267-3275PubMed Google Scholar,20Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The capacity of a receptor to cross-desensitize GPCRs has been proposed to correlate with its ability to induce a greater phosphoinositide hydrolysis (8Ali H. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We set out to investigate the possibility that the hierarchy may be related to the PKC isotypes. In this study, we first show that, in monocytes, opioid-mediated heterologous desensitization inhibits not only chemokine-induced chemotaxis but also Ca2+ mobilization in a dose-dependent manner. Such inhibitory effects result from a decrease in chemokine receptor affinity and their coupling efficiency to G protein. Furthermore, we find that, unlike chemokine receptors, opioid receptors fail to elicit a calcium flux and only activate novel and atypical PKC, resulting in modest suppression of chemokine receptor function. Our data suggest that the relative potency of G protein-coupled receptors in heterologous desensitization is dependent on which subfamily of PKC is activated. A robust heterologous desensitization requires both calcium-dependent and -independent kinase C. Opioids are unique and only utilize a calcium-independent PKC pathway to phosphorylate and inactivate heterologous receptors. MCP-1 and MIP-1α were obtained from Pepro Tech (Rocky Hill, NJ); I125-MIP-1α,3H-DAMGO, and Taq polymerase were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; Met-enkephalin was from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc.

Human peripheral monocytes were obtained from healthy donor blood packs and isolated from Buffy coats (Transfusion Medicine Department, National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD) by iso-osmotic Percoll gradient. The monocytes were >90% pure by nonspecific esterase staining or by morphological analysis. Freshly isolated monocytes were suspended in ice-cold PBS and used for experiments on the same day. HEK293, vector/HEK293, and μ-opioid receptor/HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 1 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). CCR1/HEK293, μ-receptor/CCR1/HEK293, and vector/CCR1/HEK293 cells were grown in the same buffer with 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Macrophages were generated in vitro by incubating freshly isolated monocytes at 1 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (50 ng/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator for 7 days with the addition of fresh recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor-containing medium every 2–3 days (22Yang D. Chen Q. Le Y. Wang J.M. Oppenheim J.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4092-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PCR fragments of full-length CCR1 were inserted into pcDNA 3.1 to make pCCR1. pCCR1 was linearized with ScaI and electroporated into HEK293 cells. After selection with 800 μg/ml Geneticin, the CCR1 level was screened by Western blotting, and a single colony with high expression of CCR1 was selected to generate CCR1/HEK293. Full-length μ-opiate receptor was inserted into pLZRS-IRES-EGFP retroviral vector to generate pμ-opioid receptor. The empty vector was used as a control. Phoenix-Amphotrophic Retroviral Packaging cells were plated at 1.5–2 million cells/60-mm plate in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% glutamine, 18–24 h prior to transfection (23Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 μg of each plasmid containing the desired inserts (pLZRS-IRES-EGFP) were prepared for transfection into cells by using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions (23Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 24Heemskerk M.H.H.E. Ruizendaal J.J. van der Weide M.M. Kueter E. Bakker A.Q. Schumacher T.N. Spits H. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 195: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The LZRS vector replicates episomally via use of the EBNA-1 protein and also contains a puromycin resistance gene. Finally, the inclusion of the IRES-EGFP expression cassette allows for sorting of infected target cells by flow cytometry. After transfection, the Phoenix-Ampho cells were selected with 2 μg of puromycin for 7 days, at which time the population consisted of virtually 100% EGFP-expressing cells. Infectious virus-containing supernatants were prepared by growing packaging cell lines infected with recombinant retroviral vectors as described above, in T75 flasks to ∼80% confluency and then overlaying this culture with 10 ml of complete medium to allow cells to produce virus overnight. At the same time, target cell populations were prepared by plating cells into suitable tissue culture vessels and overlaying the target culture with 0.22 μm of filtered, recombinant retrovirus-infected supernatants the following morning. Infectious supernatants were supplemented with 5 μg/ml polybrene to assist in virus attachment. 3–5 days post-infection, the target cells were sorted by flow cytometry and analyzed as described under “Results.” Chemotaxis was performed as described by the manufacturer (Neuroprobe). In brief, the monocytes were pretreated with PBS, MIP-1α, MCP-1, Met-enkephalin, or morphine for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice with binding medium (RPMI from Biowhittaker, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 20 mmHEPES) and loaded into the upper chemotaxis chambers. Chemokines, diluted to various concentrations were loaded into the lower chambers. The chambers were incubated at 37 °C, 100% humidity, and 5% CO2 for 1 h. The 5-μm filter between the chambers was then washed, fixed, and stained. The cells that migrating through the filter were counted by microscopy. The chemotaxis index was the ratio of chemotactic cell numbers in a chemokine gradientversus the cell numbers in a medium control. For HEK293 cells, the polycarbonate filter was pretreated with 50 μg/ml of collagen in binding medium at 4 °C overnight. Chemotaxis of HEK293 cells was assayed after 5 h. The statistical analysis of chemotactic responses was performed by PRISM3.0. Calcium flux was measured as described by Badolato et al. (25Badolato R, J.J. Wang J.M. McVicar D. Xu L.L. Oppenheim J.J. Kelvin D.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4004-4010PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were incubated at 107/ml for 30 min at room temperature in DMEM containing 1 μm Fura-2. The cells were then washed with DMEM once, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution twice, and diluted into 2 × 106/ml. The cells were then loaded into a 2-ml cuvette at 37 °C, and the relative ratio of fluorescent emission at 510 nm when excited by 340 nm and 380 nm was recorded by a PerkinElmer Life Sciences luminescence spectrometer. For heteorologous desensitization experiments, the cells were first incubated with Met-enkephalin or chemokines at 37 °C for 30 min before adding Fura-2. The ligand binding assays were carried out as described by Grimm et al. (7Grimm M.C. Ben-Baruch A. Taub D.D. Howard O.M. Resau J.H. Wang J.M. Ali H. Richardson R. Snyderman R. Oppenheim J.J. J. Exp.

The cells were preincubated with MIP-1α, MCP-1, or Met-enkephalin for 30 min at 37 °C, washed extensively, and resuspended in binding medium at 107/ml. The binding assays were carried out on ice using 0.5 nmI125MIP-1α in the presence of increasing concentration of competing unlabelled-MIP-1α. The cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and unbound ligands were separated from cells by a 10% sucrose gradient. The level of binding was determined in a γ-counter. Nonlinear regression analysis of data was performed by a PRISM3.0 program by fitting the following equation.Total Binding=Bmax*[Hot]/([Hot]+[Cold]+Kd)Equation 1 +Nonspecific Binding The assay was performed as described by Richardson et al.

The cells were pretreated with MIP-1a, MCP-1, Met-enkephalin, or binding medium for 45 min at 37 °C. After three washes, the cell membranes were isolated for binding assays. Assay of PKC translocation in monocytes were performed as described by Laudanna et al.(15Laudanna C. Mochly-Rosen D. Liron T. Constantin G. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30306-30315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, fresh monocytes were stored in ice-cold PBS for 90 min to decrease the membrane-bound PKC before stimulation. Cocktails of protease inhibitors were added. The cells were then stimulated at 37 °C, stopped by ice-cold PBS, homogenized by sonication, and underwent ultra-centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The supernatant was kept as the cytosolic fraction. The precipitates were sonicated in one half volume of PBS with 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 × gagain for 30 min. The solublized precipitates were kept as the membrane fraction. The samples were then loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting analysis. Confocal microscopic analysis of immunofluorescent staining of PKC isotypes was carried out as described by Etienne-Manneville (16Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Cell. 2001; 106: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). The cells were pretreated with 100 ng/ml MCP-1 or 10−7m Met-enkephalin for 10 min, then fixed, permeablized, and stained by rabbit antibody to PKC isotypes followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody. The cells were visualized using a Zeiss inverted fluorescent confocal microscope. First, we compared the degree of Met-enkephalin-mediated chemotaxis of freshly isolated monocytes to those induced by conventional chemokines, MIP-1α and MCP-1. As shown in Fig.1A, MCP-1, presumably by activating chemokine receptor, CCR2, induced a robust chemotaxis response, which peaked at 3 × 10−10m. MIP-1α, the endogenous ligand for receptor CCR1 and 5, was also a potent chemoattractant of monocytes. However, the chemotactic response of Met-enkephalin on monocytes, although significant, was less potent, with an index ranging from 2 to 4.5. Morphine was also a weaker stimulus of monocyte chemotaxis (data not shown). The lower chemotactic activity of opioids may be due to the lower receptor expression on cell surface or perhaps due to inefficient coupling between opioid receptors and Gi proteins. Furthermore, although MCP-1 and MIP-1α induced monocyte chemokinesis, the background level of monocyte motility was unchanged when treated with opiates over a wide concentration ranging from 10−11 to 10−6m (data not shown). Because opioid receptors couple to Gi proteins and induce chemotaxis, we determined to assess their capacity to elicit a concomitant Ca2+ response. As shown in Fig. 1B, both MCP-1 and MIP-1α rapidly induced a potent Ca2+ flux in monocytes, confirming that the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ flux is functional (26Locati M. Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). However, Met-enkephalin, at concentrations from 10−10 to 10−4m, failed to initiate a detectable Ca2+response in monocytes (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Morphine also did not induce any measurable Ca2+ mobilization (data not shown). The deficiency of opioid-induced Ca2+mobilization is likely due to insufficient production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate by activated Gi-coupled PLCβ. These data further suggest that the μ- and/or δ-opioid receptors are less potent in inducing chemotactic Gi signaling in monocytes than chemokine receptors. To evaluate the potency of opioid-induced desensitization, the inhibitory effects of Met-enkephalin on MIP-1α-induced chemotaxis were compared with the desensitizing effects of MIP-1α and MCP-1 on chemokine receptors. Freshly isolated monocytes pretreated with 100 ng/ml MIP-1α exhibited a reduction of more than 85% of the chemotactic response to MIP-1α, because of homologous desensitization (Fig.2A). This homologous desensitization was dose-dependent (Fig. 2B). Monocytes pretreated with 100 ng/ml MCP-1 for 30 min also showed a marked decrease in their chemotactic response to MIP-1α, because of heterologous desensitization of chemokine receptors (Fig. 2,A and B). Pretreatment with 10−8m of Met-enkephalin significantly impaired MIP-1α-mediated chemotaxis but to a lesser degree (Fig.2A). Met-enkephalin exhibited dose-dependent heterologous desensitization effects with optimal inhibitory activity of 50% at 10−6m (Fig. 2B). To determine the effect of opioid mediated heterologous desensitization on Ca2+ flux, we compared the dose dependence of the MIP-1α-elicited Ca2+ response of monocytes, which were pretreated cells with 1000 ng/ml of MIP-1α, MCP-1, or 10−7m Met-enkephalin. MIP-1α, at 0, 5, 15, 50, 150, and 500 ng/ml, induced Ca2+ flux in monocytes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C and data not shown). To directly compare homologous and heterologous desensitization, the maximal value of each Ca2+ flux was used to plot the dose response of the stimulus (Fig. 2D). Monocytes pretreated with 1000 ng/ml MIP-1α for 30 min followed by three washes failed to exhibit a detectable response to 5 and 15 ng/ml MIP-1α (Fig. 2D). Homologous desensitization also decreased the response to MIP-1α at 150 and 500 ng/ml. MCP-1 pretreatment severely reduced the MIP-1α-induced Ca2+response, but the inhibitory effects decreased as the concentration of stimulus was increased and became undetectable at 150 ng/ml of MIP-1α (Fig. 2D). Pretreatment with Met-enkephalin resulted in moderate inhibition of Ca2+ flux (Fig. 2D). Monocytes pretreated with 10−7mMet-enkephalin lost 70% of the Ca2+ response to 5 ng/ml MIP-1α. Met-enkephalin-mediated inhibitory effects were maximal when chemokine concentration was low and decreased as the chemokine concentration was increased (Fig. 2D). Both chemotaxis and calcium flux data show that the heterologous desensitization of the MIP-1α response by Met-enkephalin was significant but less potent than either homologous or heterologous desensitization of chemokine receptors by chemokines. We further examined the effect on MIP-1α-mediated chemotaxis inin vitro macrophage colony-stimulating factor-stimulated macrophages. As shown in Fig. 3, although opioids also did not induce calcium flux in activated macrophage, they induced similar heterologous desensitization of chemokine receptors in activated macrophages. Desensitization of seven-transmembrane receptors may involve internalization of receptors, decrease in ligand binding affinity, or impaired interaction with Gi proteins (11Lefkowitz R. J. Biol.

I125-MIP-1α was used to monitor the effect of Met-enkephalin on the total numbers of MIP-1α-binding sites and binding affinity on monocytes. Homologous competitive binding analyses showed a 3-fold decrease in MIP-1α binding affinity after Met-enkephalin pretreatment, whereas the total number of binding sites was unchanged (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, preincubation with MIP-1α reduced the number of surface binding sites by over 70%, presumably because of receptor internalization during homologous desensitization (Fig.4C). Activation of MCP-1 receptors also decreased the number of MIP-1α receptors by more than 35% (Fig. 4C). In contrast with our results, previously reported binding analysis, carried out at room temperature, did not reveal any detectable affinity change (7Grimm M.C. Ben-Baruch A. Taub D.D. Howard O.M. Resau J.H. Wang J.M. Ali H. Richardson R. Snyderman R. Oppenheim J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Our binding assays were performed at 4 °C to prevent MIP-1α-induced homologous desensitization. Upon ligand binding, chemokine receptors activate downstream heterotrimeric G proteins by enhancing the exchange of bound GDP to GTP. A desensitized GPCR shows a decrease in its capability to induce the binding of [35S]GTPγS to membrane G proteins. Pretreatment with Met-enkephalin for 30 min resulted in a 34% loss of MIP-1α-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding on the membrane, indicating an impairment of the coupling efficiency between chemokine receptors and downstream G protein (Fig. 4D). In contrast, the capability of MIP-1α receptors to enhance membrane [35S]GTPγS binding was severely inhibited (up to 62–70%) after pretreatment with MCP-1 or MIP-1α (Fig.4D). The decrease in both receptor affinity and coupling efficiency to G protein may directly contribute to the desensitization of MIP-1α-mediated chemotaxis, calcium flux, and other signals. The expression level of opioid receptors on monocytes and macrophages is very low relative to that of chemokine receptors. Le"

Selective expression in the pancreas appears to be principally regulated by Area II, one of four conserved regulatory sequence domains found within the 5′-flanking region of thepdx-1 gene. Detailed mutagenesis studies have identified potential sites of interaction for both positive- and negative-acting factors within the conserved sequence blocks of Area II. The islet ॆ cell-enriched RIPE3b1 transcription factor, the activator of insulin C1 element-driven expression, was shown here to also stimulate Area II by binding to sequence blocks 4 and 5 (termed B4/5). Accordingly, B4/5 DNA-binding protein's molecular mass (i.e. 46 kDa), binding specificity, and islet ॆ cell-enriched distribution were identical to RIPE3b1. Area II-mediated activation was also unaffected upon replacing B4/5 with the insulin C1/RIPE3b1 binding site. In addition, the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that the Area II region of the endogenous pdx-1 gene was precipitated by an antiserum that recognizes the large Maf protein that comprises the RIPE3b1 transcription factor.

Because islet-enriched transcription factors are essential for islet cell development, information valuable for generating transplantable cells will likely be gained by understanding how their expression is regulated.

Mutation of the Foxa2 binding site in Area II limited expression of the PstBst transgene to a subset of the islet ॆ cellsin vivo (22Samaras S.E. Cissell M.A. Gerrish K. Wright C.V. Gannon M. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4702-4713Google Scholar). In addition, conditional deletion of Foxa2 specifically from ॆ cells decreased pdx-1 mRNA and protein expression in mice (29Lee C.S. Sund N.J. Vatamaniuk M.Z. Matschinsky F.M. Stoffers D.A. Kaestner K.H. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2546-2551Google Scholar). The ability of Pax6 and Foxa2 to bind within Area II of the endogenous pdx-1 gene also strongly supports a direct role in mediating transcription in ॆ cells (22Samaras S.E. Cissell M.A. Gerrish K. Wright C.V. Gannon M. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4702-4713Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the B4/5 activator of Area II is RIPE3b1/Maf, a 46-kDa islet ॆ cell-enriched protein(s) essential for both cell type-specific (30Shieh S.Y. Tsai M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16708-16714Google Scholar, 31Sharma A. Fusco-DeMane D. Henderson E. Efrat S. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1468-1476Google Scholar) and glucose-inducible (32Sharma A. Stein R.

Moreover, an antiserum that recognizes the recently isolated large Maf protein(s) of the insulin C1/RIPE3b1 activator revealed binding to Area II of the endogenouspdx-1 gene in ॆ cells. We propose that RIPE3b1/Maf is required for transcription of genes critical to ॆ cell function. The Area II and PstBst reporter constructs were made using human (−2141/−1890-bp) and mouse (Pst/−2917bp:Bst/−1890-bp) pdx-1 sequences (23Wu K.L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M. Offield M.F. Henderson E. Ray M. Marks A. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6002-6013Google Scholar), which were cloned directly upstream of the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (TK) promoter in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression vector, pTK(An) (34Jacoby D.B. Zilz N.D. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17623-17626Google Scholar). The block transversion and insulin C1 (InsC1) substitution mutants in B4/5 were constructed in Area II:pTK and PstBst:pTK using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Each construct was determined to be correct by DNA sequencing. Monolayer cultures of pancreatic islet ॆ (ॆTC-3, HIT-T15, and Min6) and non-ॆ (NIH3T3) cell lines were maintained as described previously (35Whelan J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3253-3259Google Scholar). The LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) was used to introduce 1 ॖg each of Area II:pTK or PstBst:pTK and 0.5 ॖg of pRSVLUC. The activity from the Rous sarcoma virus enhancer-driven luciferase plasmid served as an internal transfection control for the pdx-1:pTK constructs. Luciferase (36de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Google Scholar) and CAT (37Nordeen S.K. Green P.P.D. Fowlkes D.M. DNA. 1987; 6: 173-178Google Scholar) enzymatic assays were performed 40–48 h after transfection. Each experiment was carried out more than three times with at least two independently isolated DNA preparations. Double-stranded Area II block 4 (B4, agcttTCTTTTTGCAAAGCACAGCAt), B5 (agcttAAAGCACAGCAAAAATATTAt), and B4/5 (agcttCTTTTTGCAAAGCACAGCAAAAAt) sequences, in which the lowercase lettering corresponds to linker sequences, were excised from pBluescriptKS2+ and Klenow-labeled with [α32P]dATP. The InsC1 probe spans nucleotides −126 to −101 of the rat insulin II gene and was labeled as described (38Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (39Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar). Binding reactions (20 ॖl total volume) were conducted with 5–10 ॖg of extract protein and labeled probe (8 × 104 cpm) in binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 107 glycerol, and 1 ॖg of poly(dGdC) (final concentrations). The conditions for the competition analyses were the same, except that excess (see figures for amounts) of the specific competitor DNA was included in the mixture prior to the addition of probe. Anti-c-Maf antiserum (10 ॖg, M-153, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to binding reactions 10 min prior to addition of the probe for supershift analysis. This antiserum, referred to in the text as αc-Maf M-153, was made to an N-terminal region of c-Maf that is common to the other large Mafs and cross-reacts with each (i.e. MafA, NRL, and MafB). The samples were resolved on a 67 nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio 29:1) and run in TGE buffer (50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.5). The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. ॆTC-3 and Min6 nuclear extracts (30 ॖg) were separated on a 107 SDS-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) and then electro-transferred onto an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore). The extract lanes were cut horizontally into 3-mm slices. The molecular mass range of each lane fraction was determined by comparison with colored Rainbow protein markers (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins from each fraction were eluted as previously described (38Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Google Scholar) and analyzed for B4/5 and InsC1 binding activity in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Min6 or ॆTC-3 nuclear extract (3–5 ॖg) was incubated for 10 min at 4 °C or 30 °C with and without 0.5 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP, Promega) in the presence or absence of sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4, 10 mm) or sodium pyrophosphate (NaPPi, 10 mm) in phosphatase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (CØmplete, Roche Diagnostics)) (10 ॖl total volume). The samples were analyzed for InsC1 and B4/5 binding after addition of 10 ॖl of 2× gel shift binding buffer. Immunoprecipitations using anti-Tyr(P) (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) were performed as described previously (40Matsuoka T. Zhao L. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22071-22076Google Scholar). Briefly, SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.57 (w/v) to ॆTC-3 nuclear extract (100 ॖg protein) in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 107 glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (final concentrations) and then heated to 65 °C. After diluting the SDS to 0.057, anti-Tyr(P) or control mouse IgG was added along with protein A-Sepharose beads. The washed beads were then resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and the immunoprecipitated proteins separated on a 107 SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to an Immobilon PVDF membrane, the 44–47-kDa eluted proteins were assayed for B4/5 and InsC1 binding activity. Pancreata from 6–8-week-old mice were fixed 4–5 h in 47 paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, washed, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and then 5-ॖm sections cut and mounted on glass slides. Double immunofluorescence was performed using guinea pig α-human insulin (Linco) and rabbit α-mouse c-Maf (αc-Maf M-153) as primary antibodies at dilutions of 1:2000 and 1:100, respectively. Secondary antibodies were Cy3- or Cy5-labeled donkey anti-guinea pig and anti-rabbit IgG diluted to 1:500 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Fluorescent images were captured on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope at an optical depth of 1 ॖm, false colors were assigned, and the images merged in Photoshop 5 (Adobe). Immunoperoxidase staining was performed with Vectastain Elite kits (Vector Labs) and with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride substrate (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Rabbit anti-c-maf antibody (M-153) was diluted 1:1000. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed with the following modifications of a described method (19Gerrish K. Gannon M. Shih D. Henderson E. Stoffel M. Wright C.V. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3485-3492Google Scholar, 22Samaras S.E. Cissell M.A. Gerrish K. Wright C.V. Gannon M. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4702-4713Google Scholar). The αc-Maf M-153 antiserum (10 ॖg) was incubated with sonicated formaldehyde cross-linked ॆTC3 chromatin. Normal rabbit IgG (10 ॖg, sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a control. The protein-DNA complexes were isolated with A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The PCR oligonucleotides used to detect mouse control sequences were: pdx-1 Area II, −2208 5′-GGTGGGAAATCCTTCCCTCAAG-3′ and −1927 5′-CCTTAGGGATAGACCCCCTGC-3′, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), −434 5′-GAGTGACACCTCACAGCTGTGG-3′ and −96 5′-GGCAGGCCTTTGGATCATAGCC-3′. The PCR cycling parameters were 1 cycle of 95 °C/2 min and 28 cycles of 95 °C/30 s, 61 °C/30 s, 72 °C/30 s for PEPCK and 1 cycle of 95 °C/2 min and 28 cycles of 95 °C/30 s, 57.5 °C/30 s, 72 °C/30 s for Area II. Block mutations within conserved B2 (−2131/−2115 bp), B3 (−2110/−2102 bp), B4 (−2100/−2093 bp), and B5 (−2089/−2086 bp) reduce Area II:pTK activity in ॆ cell lines (Fig.1B, HIT-T15,MIN6, and ॆTC-3) (22Samaras S.E. Cissell M.A. Gerrish K. Wright C.V. Gannon M. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4702-4713Google Scholar). To further examine the significance of these elements in Area II activation, each was mutated within the mouse pdx-1 ‘PstBst’ region that spans Area I and Area II (Fig. 1A). In the context of the more active PstBst:pTK expression construct, the B4 and B5 mutants reduced activity to a greater extent than in Area II:pTK (Fig. 1B). Combining the B4 with B5 mutations in PstBst:pTK reduced activity further than either individual mutation (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the B2 and B3 mutants had less effect on PstBst:pTK activation (data not shown). The following experiments were designed to characterize the B4 and B5 activators in ॆ cells. To define the factors associated with B4- and B5-mediated regulation, gel shift experiments were performed with probes spanning B4, B5, and B4+B5 (B4/5), and ॆTC-3 or MIN6 cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 2). Identical results were obtained with MIN6 and ॆTC-3 cells, and they were used interchangeably in these analyses. Two common protein-DNA complexes were detected with the B4 and B4/5 probes (labeled as A andB in Fig. 2B), whereas no binding was found with B5 (data not shown). The binding affinity of B4 and B4/5 for these complexes was determined with the wild type and B4/5 double mutant site (B4/5 MT) competitors. As expected, both B4 and B4/5 reduced the levels of these complexes, although B4/5 was roughly 20-fold more effective (Fig. 2B). In contrast, B5 did not compete for binding (data not shown), whereas the B4/5 MT only competed away complex B, consistent with the conclusion that it is unrelated to activation (Fig.2B). These results suggested that B4 and B5 define a single activator-binding site, which is regulated by the factor(s) found within the slower mobility complex A. To determine the distribution of the cellular factor(s) forming complex A, binding reactions were conducted with nuclear extracts from various islet (ॆ: Ins-1, Min6, HIT-T15; α, αTC-6) and non-islet cell types (neuronal, RC2.E10 (41Perez-Villamil B. Schwartz P.T. Vallejo M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3857-3860Google Scholar, 42Schwartz P.T. Perez-Villamil B. Rivera A. Moratalla R. Vallejo M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19106-19114Google Scholar), NCB20 (43West Jr., R.E. Freedman S.B. Dawson G. Miller R.J. Villereal M.L. Life Sci. 1982; 31: 1335-1338Google Scholar, 44Kato K. Higashida H. Umeda Y. Suzuki F. Tanaka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 660: 30-35Google Scholar); liver, H4IIE (45Darlington G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 151: 19-38Google Scholar), normal rat liver; kidney, MDCK, BHK; fibroblast, NIH 3T3). Complex A was uniquely detected in the ॆ cell extracts (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the factor(s) in activator complex A is enriched in ॆ cells. To estimate the size of the protein(s) in complex A, Min6 nuclear extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane that was cut into slices to represent distinct molecular masses. The separated proteins were eluted from the membrane slices, renatured, and tested for binding to the B4/5 probe. The binding specificity of fraction 8 was identical to complex A found in unfractionated Min6 extracts (Fig. 3; data no shown). The molecular mass range of the proteins in fraction 8 was 44–47 kDa. These results indicate that complex A is composed of one or more proteins of ∼46 kDa. Because the RIPE3b1 protein(s) that binds to and activates the InsC1 control element has the same cell-restricted distribution (38Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Google Scholar) and molecular size (see Fig. 3 and Ref. 38Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Google Scholar), we compared the binding properties of B4/5 to InsC1 (Fig.4). Both InsC1 and B4/5 competed effectively for complex A binding when either B4/5 or InsC1 were used as probes (Fig. 4B). In addition, RIPE3b1/complex A activity was affected in the same manner by B4/5 or InsC1 mutations that either modestly (e.g. InsC1mt1, Ref. 38Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Google Scholar) or profoundly (e.g. InsC1mt3, Ref. 38Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B,B4/5MT) affected activity. The resulting competition patterns were consistent with each element binding the same factor(s) (Fig. 4B). RIPE3b1 binding activity is inhibited by the actions of a tyrosine phosphatase (40Matsuoka T. Zhao L. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22071-22076Google Scholar). To test whether complex A formation on B4/5 is also regulated in this manner, Min6 nuclear extracts were incubated in the presence or absence of CIAP and a general (sodium pyrophosphate, NaPPi) or phosphotyrosine-specific (sodium orthovanadate, Na3VO4) phosphatase inhibitor. B4/5 and InsC1 binding activities were monitored in the treated extracts. The binding characteristics of complex A were affected in exactly the same manner with both probes (Fig. 5A). Complex A mobility was shifted upon incubating the ॆ cell nuclear extract at 30 °C with both the B4/5 and InsC1 probes, presumably because of the actions of an endogenous tyrosine phosphatase (40Matsuoka T. Zhao L. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22071-22076Google Scholar). CIAP treatment reduced binding to each probe, an effect blocked by addition of NaPPi or Na3VO4 (Fig. 5A). In addition, B4/5 bound specifically to the 46-kDa fraction immunoprecipitated from ॆTC-3 nuclear extracts with the anti-phosphotyrosine immunospecific monoclonal antibody, 4G10 (Fig.5B, compare 4G10 immunoprecipitate binding to InsC1 (40Matsuoka T. Zhao L. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22071-22076Google Scholar) and B4/5). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that RIPE3b1 binds to both the pdx-1 B4/5 and InsC1 elements. Considering the interchangeability of B4/5 and InsC1 in gel shift assays, it was surprising to find only modest sequence identity between human (h) and mouse (m) B4/5 and mouse InsC1 (Fig.6A). However, methylation interference assays over B4/5 suggested some similarity in contact nucleotides for RIPE3b1 with InsC1 (Ref. 30Shieh S.Y. Tsai M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16708-16714Google Scholar and Fig. 6A; data not shown). Because of sequence dissimilarity between B4/5 and InsC1, we tested whether InsC1 could substitute for B4/5 in the context of the PstBst:pTK reporter. Replacement of B4/5 with InsC1 maintained the same high level of activation found for wild type PstBst in Min6 ॆ cells (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, mutants in B4/5 (B4mt, B5mt, B4/5mt) and InsC1 (mut3) that compromised complex A/RIPE3b1 binding also reduced PstBst activity only in Min6 cells. These data strongly suggest that the ॆ cell-enriched RIPE3b1 transcription factor activates the B4/5 control element in Area II. The RIPE3b1 transcription factor was recently isolated and shown to be a member of the large Maf transcription factor family, most likely MafA (33Kataoka K. Han S.I. Shioda S. Hirai M. Nishizawa M. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49903-49910Google Scholar, 46Olbrot M. Rud J. Moss L.G. Sharma A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6737-6742Google Scholar). 3T. Matsuoka, L. Zhao, and R. Stein, unpublished observations.To determine whether the B4/5 binding complex A contained a large Maf protein, Min6 nuclear extract was preincubated with a polyclonal antiserum raised to N-terminal sequences of c-Maf shared with other members of the large Maf family. This c-Maf antiserum, termed αc-Maf M-153, cross-reacts with MafA, MafB, and NRL (46Olbrot M. Rud J. Moss L.G. Sharma A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6737-6742Google Scholar). 4T. Matsuoka, L. Zhao, and R. Stein, unpublished observations. Complex A was completely supershifted by αc-Maf M-153, whereas IgG had no effect (Fig. 4C). These results strongly suggested that complex A contains the RIPE3b1/Maf protein. Immunohistochemical analysis performed with αc-Maf M-153 on adult mouse pancreas also showed that the large Maf protein(s) of the RIPE3b1/Complex A activator was nuclear and expressed almost exclusively in insulin-producing ॆ cells (Fig.7). To directly determine whether RIPE3b1/Maf binds within Area II of the endogenous pdx-1 gene, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed using formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin from ॆTC-3 cells. The cross-linked DNA was precipitated with the Maf antiserum and PCR-amplified with Area II and PEPCK promoter-specific primers. The Maf antibody was capable of immunoprecipitating Area II sequences, whereas the control IgG could not (Fig. 8). However"

The protein Pdr5p has been shown to share nucleotide triphosphatases activities, as well as substrates and modulators, with the human MDR1-Pgp (13Rogers B. Decottignies A. Kolaczkowsi M. Carcajal E.

The predicted topography of Pdr5p comprises two hydrophobic domains, each composed of six trans-membrane segments (TMS6), and two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains (NBD), corresponding to a named (TMS6-NBD)2 舠full transporter舡 (24Klein I. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 237-262Google Scholar, 25Dassa E. Bouige P. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 211-229Google Scholar). However, the disposition of the two hydrophobic domains and of the two hydrophilic NBDs of Pdr5p mirrors that of the major eucaryotic ABC proteins. Each half-Pdr5p starts with an NH2-terminal NBD followed by the first TMS6 tract, whereas in Pgp, the TMS6 tracts precede the nucleotide binding domains. Thus, despite similar mechanisms of substrate recognition and transport, the significance of such domain inversion in yeast ABC transporters is unknown. This is mainly related to the lack of structural information on yeast ABC transporters as compared with mammalian full-transporters (26Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Google Scholar, 27Rosenberg M.F. Mao Q. Holzenburg A. Ford R.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16076-16082Google Scholar, 28Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.

Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Google Scholar, 32Chami M. Steinfels E. Orelle C. Jault J.M. Di Pietro A. Rigaud J.L. Marco S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1075-1085Google Scholar, 33Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Google Scholar). Here, we report the first three-dimensional reconstruction of an ABC transporter from S. cerevisiae. The overexpression of Pdr5p in the yeast pdr1–3 mutant allowed the production of high amounts of the transporter (12Decottignies A. Kolaczkowski M. Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12797-12803Google Scholar, 16Balzi E. Goffeau A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 241-252Google Scholar). The overexpressed His-tagged Pdr5p plasma membrane protein of 160 kDa was solubilized and purified through Ni-NTA chromatography. Controlled detergent removal from a lipid-detergent-Pdr5p micellar solution led to the production of square-shaped particles of about 11 nm in side that have been analyzed by electron microscopy and single particle techniques. A three-dimensional structure of Pdr5p has been computed at 25-Å resolution from negatively stained lipid-reconstituted samples. This volume showed a dimeric organization of Pdr5p, in which each monomer protruded out of the membrane through two stalks ending each one by a cytoplasmic NBD lobe. Comparison with the reported structures of bacterial ABC transporters (31Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Google Scholar, 32Chami M. Steinfels E. Orelle C. Jault J.M. Di Pietro A. Rigaud J.L. Marco S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1075-1085Google Scholar) showed a common cone-shaped organization that leaves a large chamber between the two stalks bearing the NBDs. The present work also revealed that the two NBDs are spatially close and asymmetrically organized, appearing oriented perpendicularly in the Pdr5p monomer. Such an observation supports the hypothesis of a functional asymmetry of ABC transporters (34Senior A.E. Gadsby D.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 143-150Google Scholar, 35van Veen H.W. Higgins C.F. Konings W.N. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 185-192Google Scholar) and suggests catalytic mechanisms in which the NBDs can move around the major axe of the stalk. Phospholipids of the highest purity were purchased from Avantis Polar Lipids,n-dodecyl-ॆ-d-maltopyranoside (DDM) was from Sigma and Bio-Beads SM2 (20–50 mesh) were from Bio-Rad. Ni-NTA columns were from Qiagen. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Overexpression of PDR5–6HISp has been achieved by integration of the PDR5–6HIS allele at the PDR5 locus in the AD12345678 strain (pdr1–3, yor1D::hisG, snq2D::hisG, pdr5D::hisG, pdr10D::hisG, pdr11D::hisG, ycf1D::hisG, pdr15D::hisG, pdr3D::hisG, ura3−) described in Decottignieset al. (36Decottignies A. Grant A.M. Nichols J.W. de Wet H. McIntosh D.B. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12612-12622Google Scholar). In this strain, the pdr1–3 gain-of-function mutation activates the PDR5–6HISgene transcription, which is controlled by its own promotor. The PDR5–6HIS allele was constructed by PCR retrieval on the PDR3.3deltaK plasmid of 615 bp of the PDR5 gene spanning from the internal MluI site (+3939/ATG) to the last codon before the STOP, using the primer sequences 5′-GAACGCGTCTGCAGCTGGCCAGT and 5′-CGCCAGGTTAACTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTTTCTTGGAGAGTTTACCGTTCTTTTT, to which the restriction site AvrII, the STOP codon, and the His6-tag had been included. TheMluI/AvrII PCR fragment was used for replacement of the original 807-bp MluI/AvrII fragment of PDR5. This replacement resulted in the loss of PDR5 terminator from position +4531(STOP) to 4745 and yielded pAD-YE/PDR5–6HIS in which the His6-tag substituted the last 3B4-terminal PDR5 codon. The 6.8-kb KpnI/BamHI fragment containing the PDR5–6HIS allele was cloned into pSK to give pAD-SK/PDR5–6HIS. The AD12345678 strain was transformed with theKpnI/SpeI-cleaved pAD-SK/PDR5–6HIS plasmid. Yeast transformants were selected onto 0.05 ॖg/ml cycloheximide, and recombination in the yeast genome of the PDR5–6HIS allele was checked by PCR. The recombinant strains were grown overnight at 30 °C in 5.87 glucose, 27 yeast extract, pH 5.2, until late exponential phase (300 million cells/ml). Enriched plasma membrane fraction (including the acidic precipitation of contaminating mitochondrial membranes) were prepared as described in Goffeau and Dufour (37Goffeau A. Dufour J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 528-533Google Scholar) and stored before use at −70 °C. Plasma membranes were solubilized by DDM (protein/detergent ratio = 1.2 w/w) in a 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, during 15 min at room temperature under stirring. After centrifugation the solubilized membrane proteins were loaded onto a Ni-NTA resin column pre-equilibrated in 0.17 DDM, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. After 2-h incubation at 4 °C for His-tagged protein binding, the column was washed extensively with 10 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.5, 0.17 DDM. Purified protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.5, 0.17 DDM. The purified protein eluted at a concentration of about 0.5 mg of protein/ml, and samples were stored at −70 °C. The protein content was assayed according to Bradford (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were analyzed on 107 SDS-PAGE gels, according to the method of Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 or silver nitrate. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and Pdr5–6HISp was detected by chemiluminescence using the INDIA HisProbe-HRP (Pierce). UTPase activity was measured at pH 6.3 as described in Decottignies et al. (36Decottignies A. Grant A.M. Nichols J.W. de Wet H. McIntosh D.B. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12612-12622Google Scholar). Purified His-Pdr5p was mixed with phospholipids in the same buffer used for protein purification. Different lipidic compositions, includingl-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, dioleoylphophatidylcholine, Escherichia coli lipids, and egg phosphatidylcholine with or without 107 negatively charged phospholipids were analyzed. The best results were obtained usingl-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine at lipid to protein ratios ranging from 0.5 to 1 w/w. After 1-h incubation at 25 °C, allowing micellar equilibration, detergent was removed by addition of 5 mg Bio-Beads per 50 ॖl and aliquots taken as a function of time for electron microscopy analysis (32Chami M. Steinfels E. Orelle C. Jault J.M. Di Pietro A. Rigaud J.L. Marco S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1075-1085Google Scholar). Structures produced during protein reconstitution experiments were analyzed by negative staining using 17 uranyl acetate, after sample adsorption onto glow-discharged 300-mesh carbon-coated grids. For three-dimensional reconstruction, untilted electron micrographs and tilted pairs (0 and 45°) were recorded onto a Philips CM120 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV and nominal magnification of ×35,000, using a low dose system and −1 ॖm as the defocus value. All micrographs were recorded on a 1024 × 1024 pixel Gatan ssCCD camera resulting in a pixel size of 5.78 Å/pixel. A total number of 2 × 910 projections from tilted pairs and 767 from untilted images were windowed and centered by using X-MIPP software (40Marabini R. Masegosa I.M. San Martı́n C. Marco S. Fernández J.J. de la Fraga L.G. Vaquerizo C. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 237-240Google Scholar) and PSPC algorithm (41Marco S. Chagoyen M. Fraga L.G. Carazo J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Ultramicroscopy. 1996; 66: 5-10Google Scholar) before classification. Self-organizing mapping based on the Kohonen neural network (42Marabini R. Carazo J.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1804-1814Google Scholar) was performed over untilted images of tilted pairs. Multivariate statistical analysis (43van Heel M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1981; 6: 187-194Google Scholar, 44van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1984; 21: 164-184Google Scholar) of dictionary vectors was used to perform the map segmentation and to identify the homogeneous groups of projections. The average image of each group was computed and a rotational analysis was performed before three-dimensional reconstruction of each homogeneous class. Volume computing, merging, and refinement (45Penczek P. Radermacher M. Franck J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Google Scholar, 46Penczek P. Grassuci A. Franck J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Google Scholar) were performed using SPIDER software (47Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Google Scholar). Volume symmetry was analyzed by searching the maximum correlation coefficient value between the refined volume and itself when rotated at different angles. Final volume was computed after symmetry applying, refinement, and filtering at the resolution estimated by the Fourier ring correlation method (48Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. J. Microsc. 1982; 127: 127-138Google Scholar, 49Penczek P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 115-116Google Scholar). Volume rendering was performed using ETDIPS v2 software (50Mullick, R., Venkataraman, S., Warusavithana, S., Nguyen, H. T., and Raghavan, R. (1998) Annual Meeting of the Society for Computer Applications in Radiology(www.cc.nih.gov/cip/software/etdips/).Google Scholar). The plasma membrane preparation, from recombinant yeast cells, contains high amounts of Pdr5p similar to those of Pma1p, the major constitutive component in wild type yeast plasma membranes in which Pdr5p is undetectable. It was verified that the Pdr5-H6p-enriched plasma membranes contained a novel UTPase activity (about 0.8 ॖmol·min−1·mg−1), which was previously shown to be a specific marker for Pdr5p (12Decottignies A. Kolaczkowski M. Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12797-12803Google Scholar). The solubilization of the membranes by DDM and the protein purification through a Ni-NTA column allowed us to obtain samples containing a major polypeptide of 160 kDa (Fig. 1A), which corresponds to the expected molecular weight of Pdr5-H6p, cleared out from the major Pma1p contaminant. When analyzed by electron microscopy, the purified preparation only shows small and large (about 11 × 11 nm) micellar particles with no aggregates observable. In addition, due to the presence of high detergent concentration, negative staining of these preparations produces noisy images, precluding detailed single particle analysis. Addition of phospholipids to the micellar purified protein, followed by the addition of Bio-Beads for detergent removal, led to a partial reconstitution of Pdr5p into proteoliposomes. Interestingly, after 1-h treatment with Bio-Beads, which decreases the detergent concentration to below its critical micellar concentration (data not shown; see Ref. 32Chami M. Steinfels E. Orelle C. Jault J.M. Di Pietro A. Rigaud J.L. Marco S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1075-1085Google Scholar), the proteins non-incorporated into proteoliposomes appear as clearly visible square particles having 11 nm in side and suitable for single particle analysis (Fig. 1B). The partial reconstitution of Pdr5p into proteoliposomes is dependent upon the lipid composition and the best results, in terms of the number of individual particles non-incorporated into proteoliposomes, have been obtained with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. Longer incubation with Bio-Beads to remove residual detergent leads to the stacking of the square-shaped particles into larger globular lipid-protein aggregates. A gallery of representative images windowed from negatives is shown in Fig. 1C. Self-organizing mapping and multivariable statistical analysis on these images result in the identification of three major classes representing 917 of the total population. The first class (567 of images) is composed by 4-fold symmetrical projections presenting four circular stain excluding regions, of about 5 nm in diameter, arranged around a central stain-penetrating area (Fig. 2A). The second class (207 of images) corresponds to 2-fold rectangular shape views of Pdr5p having about 11 nm × 13 nm (Fig. 2B). Finally, the third class (157 of images) is a 4-fold cross pattern presenting four pear-shaped stain-excluding regions, about 5 × 4 nm, that join at the center of the particle (Fig. 2C). Comparison of the non-symmetrical volumes, computed from the corresponding tilted images belonging to each class, demonstrates that the three classes corresponded to different projections of the same object (TableI). Thus, projections belonging to the second class (Fig.2B) correspond to a volume perpendicularly oriented (θ ≈ 90°, ψ ≈ 0°) to that computed from the projections of the first class (Fig. 2A). The volume from the third class correlates well with an orientation intermediate between those of the two other classes.Table IEuler angles φ, θ, and ψ and cross-correlation coefficients (CCC) computed between the different independent volumes from each major class of Pdr5 projectionsVolumesφθψCCC01 × 0213.413891.1180−5.55880.560664402 × 0312.5190−20.9423−15.97080.6020135Volume 1, computed from the major class, has been selected as reference. Maximum cross-correlation coefficient and its associated Euler angles between volumes 1 and 2 demonstrated that they correspond to reconstructions computed from projections of the same object oriented in perpendicular directions. Euler angles observed for cross-correlation between volumes 1 and 3 show that the last one is slightly tilted in relation to the first one. Open table in a new tab Volume 1, computed from the major class, has been selected as reference. Maximum cross-correlation coefficient and its associated Euler angles between volumes 1 and 2 demonstrated that they correspond to reconstructions computed from projections of the same object oriented in perpendicular directions. Euler angles observed for cross-correlation between volumes 1 and 3 show that the last one is slightly tilted in relation to the first one. The existence of two perpendicular volumes allowed us to compute a merged reconstruction for refinement and symmetry analysis. The reconstruction obtained after two cycles of refinement from the merged volume presents a maximum correlation value (0.75), with itself when rotated φ ≈ 180°, θ = ψ ≈ 0°, demonstrating the existence of a 2-fold symmetry. Combination of the whole image set, including images belonging to the third class, allows us to compute a final 25-Å resolution three-dimensional reconstruction after 2-fold symmetry imposition (Fig.3A). This final volume reveals the presence of four 140-Å-long components, each one composed of three domains corresponding, from top to bottom, to a near globular domain (50-Å diameter and 60-Å height) compatible in dimensions with a NBD, a 40-Å stalk and, finally, a 50-Å height domain compatible in dimensions with a lipid bilayer. According to the predicted (TMS6-NBD)2 structural organization of the Pdr5p monomer, it is concluded that the final reconstruction represents a dimer of this full ABC transporter with the four globular domains corresponding to the four NBD domains. The membrane domains provide contacts between the four hydrophobic components. As these contacts are not equivalent, the interpretation of a dimeric structure, in which the two dimers are separated by the region of lowest stain penetration, is favored (see Fig. 3C). To assign in more detail each region of the Pdr5p molecule in the three-dimensional reconstruction obtained in negative staining, it has been compared with our recent cryo-electron microscopy three-dimensional reconstruction structure of the YvcC homodimer fromBacillus subtilis (32Chami M. Steinfels E. Orelle C. Jault J.M. Di Pietro A. Rigaud J.L. Marco S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1075-1085Google Scholar) and to the x-ray crystallographic data on the MsbA homodimer from E. coli (31Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 3, A–C, the dimensions and shape of the three-dimensional reconstruction of the Pdr5p dimer are similar to a dimer of YvcC homodimers, while the x-ray structure of MsbA matches well into the volume reconstruction of a Pdr5p monomer (see also Ref.32Chami M. Steinfels E. Orelle C. Jault J.M. Di Pietro A. Rigaud J.L. Marco S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1075-1085Google Scholar for a fit of MsbA into the volume reconstruction of YvcC). This allows us to conclude that these bacterial and Pdr5p have a common structure and that a monomer of the yeast ABC transporter protrudes out of the membrane through two well separated stalks to a height of about 4 nm, each one ending by a cytoplasmic lobe which correlates with a NBD domain. In addition, the three-dimensional reconstructions of Pdr5p and YvcC reveal a close arrangement of the NBDs, appearing slightly disconnected in Pdr5p due to the use of negative staining. It is also interesting to compare our data with structural features reported from electron microscopy analysis of single molecules and different two-dimensional crystals of hamster and mouse Pgp (26Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Google Scholar, 27Rosenberg M.F. Mao Q. Holzenburg A. Ford R.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16076-16082Google Scholar,30Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40125-40131Google Scholar). Single particle analysis, in negative staining, of these detergent-solubilized ABC transporters has been interpreted assuming a monomeric state of these ABC transporters. However, all reported structures approximate a cylinder of about 100 Å in diameter, which in fact corresponds to the size of a Pdr5p dimer or to the size of a dimer of an YvcC homodimer. On the other hand, the size and shape of Pgp monomers, deduced from projection maps of two-dimensional crystals at 25-Å resolution, varied with the origin of Pgp, the method used for the production of two-dimensional crystals as well as with the method of specimen embedding (28Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2002; 20: 5615-5625Google Scholar, 30Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40125-40131Google Scholar). Interestingly, the projection structure of the mouse Pgp was compared with the projection structure deduced from the X-Ray model of MsbA in the 舠open舡 conformation, with well separated nucleotide-binding domains as they appear in the three-dimensional crystal (31Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Google Scholar), or in the 舠closed舡 conformation, with the nucleotide-binding domains brought into contact by modifying the MsbA co-ordinate file (30Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40125-40131Google Scholar). As the dimensions of the projection of MsbA were roughly 115 × 45 Å in the open conformation and 70 × 50 Å in the manually closed conformation, Lee et al. (30Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40125-40131Google Scholar) suggested that the mouse Pgp (68 × 45 Å) crystallized in the lipid bilayer in a closed conformation with the two NBDs and the two stalks in close contact. In contrast, our data on Pdr5p, as well as on YvcC, demonstrate that the NBDs can be in contact, or only slightly disconnected, while the stalks are spatially separated. This infers that the two NBDs can be in contact while preserving an open V-shaped structure of the transporter without the need for large movements of the trans-membrane segments to bring the two stalks in close contact. In this context, it should be stressed that the model proposed by Lee et al. (30Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40125-40131Google Scholar) does not take into account that (i) in the reported MsbA open structure, the disordered NBDs are not resolved accurately and are expected to be much closer than 50 Å, and (ii) a projection structure in negative staining does not give any information about the organization of the trans-membrane domains. Accordingly, it was reported that, in frozen-hydrated two-dimensional crystals, the hamster Pgp monomer had an elliptical shape, 91 × 60 Å, larger than the dimensions, 70 × 70 Å, observed in negatively stained two-dimensional crystals (28Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2002; 20: 5615-5625Google Scholar) and more compatible with the dimensions of MsbA in the open conformation. Another important feature of the Pdr5p structure is that the orientations of the four NBD lobes in the Pdr5p dimer reconstruction are not the same. As shown by the arrows in Fig.3A, two contiguous NBD lobes appear to be oriented perpendicularly. This observation correlates with the clear asymmetry of the NBDs observed in the YvcC homodimer (Fig. 3B). Functional asymmetry has been proposed for the NBDs of other transporters including Pgp (51Takada Y. Yamada K. Taguchi Y. Kino K. Matsuo M. Tucker S.J. Komano T. Amachi T. Ueda K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 131-136Google Scholar, 52Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Germann U.A. Cheng P.W. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13887-13899Google Scholar), CFTR (34Senior A.E. Gadsby D.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 143-150Google Scholar), and Ste6 (53Proff C. Kolling R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 883-893Google Scholar). Noteworthy, a transport model of a two-cylinder engine has been proposed (35van Veen H.W. Higgins C.F. Konings W.N. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 185-192Google Scholar). In such mechanistic model, a (TMS6-NBD)2 structure, corresponding to a full transporter such as Pdr5 or to an homodimer of a half-transporter such as YvcC, would work co-operatively by using each (TMS6-NBD) alternatively to couple drug transport to ATP hydrolysis. The ATP-bound state is thought to be associated with a high affinity drug-binding site, while the ADP-bound state would be associated with a low affinity site and the ADP-Pi-bound state with an occluded drug-binding site. Moreover, differential interaction of nucleotides at the two NBD transporters has been recently described in the cystic fibrosis trans-membrane conductance regulator (54Aleksandrov L. Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15419-15425Google Scholar). According to the two-cylinder engine model, the two NBDs are never equivalent and appear asymmetric in the snapshot structure. In this framework, the clear asymmetry and the different orientations of the NBDs observed in the three-dimensional reconstruction of Pdr5 and YvcC suggest mechanisms in which the NBDs can move around the major axes of the stalks during the catalytic cycle. Such conformational changes could be coupled to a rotation of the trans-membrane segments as suggested from hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics and limited proteolysis on MDR-associated protein (MRP)-1 (55Manciu L. Chang X.B. Buyse F. Hou Y.X. Gustot A. Riordan J.R. Ruysschaert J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3347-3356Google Scholar). Such a hypothetical mechanism would not necessarily imply large movements of the trans-membrane segments going from an open to a closed state bringing the two stalks in close contact. A last point that deserves some comments is that Pdr5p tends to dimerize upon membrane reconstitution by detergent removal, as already observed for YvcC homodimers (Ref. 32Chami M. Steinfels E. Orelle C. Jault J.M. Di Pietro A. Rigaud J.L. Marco S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1075-1085Google Scholar; Fig. 3B). The appearance of dimers may simply reflect favorable protein-protein interactions during reconstitution rather than reflecting a native dimer. However, the possibility of an interaction between the first cytolosic loops (CL1) of two neighboring Pdr5p molecules has been reported recently and could possibly have implications for dimerization of this ABC transporter (56Rao G.S. Bacbhawat A.K. Gupta C.M. Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2002; 1: 357-366Google Scholar). In addition, a dimeric organization of different ABC transporters in native membranes has been proposed based on radiation inactivation and cross-linking experiments, as well as on the use of fusion proteins or monoclonal antibodies (57Marshall J. Fang S. Ostedgaard L.S. O'Riordan C.R. Ferrara D. Amara J.F. Hoppe IV, H. Scheule R.K. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2987-2995Google Scholar, 58Boscoboinik D. Debanne M.T.

Johnson W.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 909-916Google Scholar). In summary, the present study reports the first three-dimensional reconstruction, at 25-Å resolution, of Pdr5p, an ABC transporter fromS. cerevisiae. The dimensions and shape of the full-transporter Pdr5p compare well with the three-dimensional reconstruction of the B. subtilis half-transporter YvcC (32Chami M. Steinfels E. Orelle C. Jault J.M. Di Pietro A. Rigaud J.L. Marco S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1075-1085Google Scholar) and with the x-ray data on the E. coli half-transporter MsbA (31Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Google Scholar). This suggests a common architecture of these ABC transporters, which could be extended to other MDRs such as the mammalian P-glycoproteins. The most important features of our three-dimensional reconstruction are 1) the close arrangement of the two NBDs while the stalks are spatially separated and 2) the different orientations of the two NBDs. Our data suggest mechanisms involving significant rotational movements of the NBDs during the catalytic cycle. Three-dimensional reconstructions in the presence of different substrates and/or inhibitors may provide more detailed understanding of the conformational changes associated with the pumping mechanisms of ABC transporters."

Earlier studies have shown that down-regulation of adipose tissue LPL during fasting is post-translational and involves a shift from active to inactive forms of the lipase. Studies in cell systems had indicated that during fasting LPL might be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. We have now explored the relation between active/inactive and intra/extracellular forms of the lipase. Within adipocytes, neither LPL mass nor the distribution of LPL between active and inactive forms changed on fasting. Extracellular LPL mass also did not change significantly, but shifted from predominantly active to predominantly inactive. To explore if changes in secretion were compensated by changes in turnover, synthesis of new protein was blocked by cycloheximide. The rates at which intra- and extracellular LPL mass and activity decreased did not change on fasting. To further explore how LPL is distributed in the tissue, heparin (which detaches the enzyme from the endothelial surface) was injected. Tissue LPL activity decreased by about 107 in 2 min and by 507 in 1 h. Heparin released mainly the active form of the lipase. There was no change of LPL activity or mass within adipocytes. The fraction of extracellular LPL that heparin released and the time course were the same in fed and fasted rats, indicating that active, extracellular LPL was distributed in a similar way in the two nutritional states. This study suggests that the nutritional regulation of LPL in adipose tissue determines the activity state of extracellular LPL. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) acts at the vascular endothelium.

This study suggests that the nutritional regulation of LPL in adipose tissue determines the activity state of extracellular LPL. lipoprotein lipase endoplasmic reticulum Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)1 is an enzyme that acts at the vascular endothelium (1Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Google Scholar, 2Olivecrona T. Olivecrona G. Betteridge D.J. Illingworth D.R. Shepherd J. Lipoproteins in Health and Disease. Arnold, London1999: 223-246Google Scholar). It hydrolyzes triglycerides in lipoproteins and thereby makes the fatty acids available for cellular metabolic reactions. The enzyme is synthesized in and secreted by parenchymal cells in the tissue, e.g. adipocytes and myocytes, and is transferred to the endothelium to which it becomes anchored by interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. It was shown already in 1959 that the LPL activity in adipose tissue changes rapidly in response to the nutritional state (3Hollenberg C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1959; 197: 667-670Google Scholar, 4Eckel R.H. Borensztajn J. Lipoprotein Lipase. Evener Publishers, Chicago1987: 79-132Google Scholar). Studies by the Robinson group then demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between the LPL activity and the uptake of fatty acids from labeled chylomicrons in rat adipose tissue (5Cryer A. Riley S.E. Williams E.R. Robinson D.S. Clin. Sci. Mol. Med. 1976; 50: 213-221Google Scholar). This suggests that LPL is an important determinant for the distribution of lipids between tissues (6Preiss-Landl K. Zimmermann R. Hammerle G. Zechner R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 471-481Google Scholar). The mechanism for the regulation is, however, not clear. The regulation appears to be post-transcriptional. LPL mRNA in (rat) adipose tissue turns over with a half-life of 17 h, far too slowly to account for the rapid drop of enzyme activity when food is withdrawn (7Bergö M. Wu G. Ruge T. Olivecrona T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11927-11932Google Scholar). Several groups have found that LPL mRNA and/or relative rate of LPL synthesis (8Semb H. Olivecrona T. Biochim. Biophys.

There are two forms of the lipase in tissues (15Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Google Scholar). One form is catalytically active and has high affinity for heparin. This is the predominant form in adipose tissue of fed rats. The other form is catalytically inactive, has low affinity to heparin and predominates in adipose tissue during fasting. When fasted rats are given food, the LPL activity returns to fed levels in 4–6 h. This increase of activity requires synthesis of new LPL molecules; there is no evidence that the inactive lipase protein can be recruited into the active form (7Bergö M. Wu G. Ruge T. Olivecrona T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11927-11932Google Scholar,16Ben-Zeev O. Mao H.Z. Doolittle M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10727-10738Google Scholar). Many studies have shown that the LPL activity that is released when pieces of adipose tissue are incubated in heparin-containing medium (4Eckel R.H. Borensztajn J. Lipoprotein Lipase. Evener Publishers, Chicago1987: 79-132Google Scholar,12Lee J.J. Smith P.J. Fried S.K. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 940-946Google Scholar) or when adipose tissue is perfused with heparin (17Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Metabolism. 1988; 37: 597-601Google Scholar) (舠heparin-releasable LPL舡) changes more than total tissue LPL activity. This indicates that the regulation is exerted mainly on the extracellular LPL (18Braun J.E.A. Severson D.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 337-347Google Scholar). Short-term regulation of LPL in adipose tissue thus appears to involve changes both in the activity state of the LPL protein and in the distribution of LPL between intra- and extracellular locations in the tissue, but it is not known how these two parameters are related to each other. To resolve this, we have measured LPL activity and mass in adipose tissue and in adipocytes isolated from the tissue. In some experiments we have blocked synthesis of new enzyme to study the turnover of the different pools of LPL, and we have studied which pools of LPL (active/inactive, intra/extracellular) that are accessible to heparin release. All results point to extracellular LPL as the target for short-term nutritional regulation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (23 days old) weighing around 60 g were from Möllegaard Breeding Center (Ejby, Denmark). They were allowed to acclimatize for 7–10 days by which time they had reached a weight of ∼120 g. The rats were kept in a well ventilated, temperature (21 °C)- and humidity (40–457)-controlled room with free access to a standard laboratory chow (Laktamin AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and tap water. The light in the room was on between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. In experiments where the rats were to be fasted, food was withdrawn from the cages at 6 a.m., and a grid was placed at the bottom of the cages to prevent coprophagia. The rats were killed by decapitation. The adipose depot used in all experiments was the periepididymal one. In some experiments the tissue was cut into small pieces and digested with collagenase to isolate the adipocytes as described (19Semb H. Olivecrona T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 876: 249-255Google Scholar). The animal ethics committee in Umeå approved the animal experiments. Cycloheximide, bovine serum albumin, and collagenase were from Sigma, protease inhibitor mixture tablets 舠Complete Mini舡 was from Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany. Heparin was from Lövens (Malmö, Sweden).125I-LPL was prepared as described (20Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 102-116Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest commercial grade. LPL was extracted from tissues by homogenization in an ammonia buffer (pH 8.2) containing detergents and protease inhibitors as described (15Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Google Scholar) but with the protease inhibitor mixture tablets Complete Mini (Roche Diagnostics) instead of the inhibitors previously used. The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm, after which the intermediate phase (between the floating fat droplets and the pellet) was used for assay of LPL activity and mass. Most of the data on activity or mass were calculated relative to the amount of DNA in the sample, which was measured by fluorometry as described by Labarca and Paigen (21Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Google Scholar). In some experiments active and inactive forms of LPL in the extracts were separated on heparin-agarose as described (15Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Google Scholar). LPL activity was measured as described (15Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Google Scholar). The substrate was3H-labeled triolein in Intralipid (107) kindly prepared by Pharmacia-UpJohn (Stockholm, Sweden). Briefly, 2 ॖl of tissue homogenate (triplicate samples) was incubated for 60 min at 25 °C with substrate in the presence of 10 ॖl of heat-inactivated serum from fasted rats (as source of apolipoprotein CII) and 67 bovine serum albumin. The total volume was 200 ॖl. After termination of lipolysis by addition of organic solvents, the fatty acids were extracted and counted for radioactivity. One milliunit of lipase activity represents 1 nmol of fatty acids released per minute. LPL mass was determined with a sandwich enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay as described before (15Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Google Scholar) but with bovine LPL as standard. Briefly, three different dilutions of tissue homogenate were incubated in microtiter plate wells previously coated with affinity-purified chicken anti-LPL IgG. Detection was mediated via the 5D2 monoclonal antibody (a kind gift by Dr. John Brunzell, Seattle, WA) followed by a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured in a Spectramax microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used. As reported earlier (15Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Google Scholar) LPL mass was similar, but LPL activity was higher in adipose tissue from fed compared with fasted rats (Table I). To study the distribution of LPL within the tissue we used collagenase to digest the extracellular matrix. The adipocytes were then isolated by floatation. LPL activity was similar in adipocytes from fed and fasted rats (TableI). Hence, the higher LPL activity in fed rats was due entirely to higher extracellular LPL activity.Table IDistribution of LPL in rat adipose tissueNutritional state and sampleLPL activityLPL massmilliunit/gmilliunit/ॖg DNAng/gng/ॖg DNAFed Tissue1663 ± 2231-ap < 0.001 comparing fed and fasted.6.26 ± 1.81-ap < 0.001 comparing fed and fasted.1789 ± 31417.4 ± 1.1 Adipocytes497 ± 1302.08 ± 1.0512 ± 1123.8 ± 1.3 Extracellular1166 ± 2111-ap < 0.001 comparing fed and fasted.1277 ± 214Fasted Tissue825 ± 1303.47 ± 0.71632 ± 24117.1 ± 2.5 Adipocytes495 ± 1222.07 ± 1.2567 ± 1363.6 ± 1.8 Extracellular330 ± 881065 ± 200Epididymal adipose tissue was collected from fed or 24-hour fasted rats.

No value for extracellular LPL can be calculated from these values. All values are mean ± S.D. for six rats in each group. When bovine or rat LPL was incubated with collagenase, LPL activity and mass decreased rapidly. To study why this happened,125I-labeled bovine LPL was added to the medium, which after incubation for a few minutes was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Radioautography showed that a number of low-molecular weight bands had been formed, demonstrating that LPL is rapidly cleaved by collagenase under the conditions used to isolate adipocytes. Hence, it was not possible to recover and directly measure extracellular LPL. The pellet of sedimented cells (often called the stromal-vascular cells) contained only 37 of tissue LPL activity and 47 of tissue LPL mass. Hence, virtually all LPL was either in adipocytes or extracellular. The amount of extracellular LPL could therefore be estimated as the difference between tissue total and adipocytes. This activity was 3.5-fold higher in fed compared with fasted rats (Table I). In contrast, extracellular LPL mass did not differ significantly between the nutritional states. This experiment was repeated six times with some variations (age of rats, time of fasting). The difference in tissue LPL activity between fed and fasted rats ranged from 2-fold (as in this experiment) to more than 4-fold. It was a consistent finding that LPL activity within adipocytes was the same irrespective of the nutritional state so that the difference in tissue LPL activity was always due to a difference in extracellular activity. LPL mass on the other hand did not differ significantly with nutritional state, in tissue total, in adipocytes, or extracellular (Table I). Earlier studies have shown that rat tissues contain at least two forms of LPL (15Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Google Scholar). The catalytically active form has high heparin affinity and elutes at about 1 m NaCl from heparin-agarose. Inactive LPL elutes earlier in the gradient. There is more active than inactive LPL in adipose tissue from fed rats, whereas the reverse is true for fasted rats. We obtained similar results in the present study (Fig.1, upper panels). The peak ratio (area of mass in the first peak divided by that in the second peak) was 0.49 ± 0.06 and 2.26 ± 0.14 in tissue extracts from fed and fasted rats, respectively. In contrast, there was no difference in the distribution of LPL between the active and inactive forms within the adipocytes (Fig. 1, lower panels). The peak ratios were 2.05 ± 0.15 and 2.25 ± 0.04 in fed and fasted rats, respectively. The specific activity for the enzyme that eluted in peak two was similar (about 1 milliunit/ng) for all four separations,i.e. for total tissue LPL as well as for adipocyte LPL in fed and in fasted rats. The size of the pools of LPL are determined in part by the turnover rates, which might change with the nutritional state. To explore this, rats were injected with cycloheximide. In the experiment in Fig. 2, LPL mass decreased by 65–757 in 2 h, indicating a half-life in the order of 1 h. There was no difference between fed and fasted rats (Fig. 2, lower panel). This rules out the possibility that the relatively large amount of inactive LPL in adipose tissue of fasted rats represents dead-end material that turns over slowly. After the first 2 h, the decrease of LPL became much slower, presumably because incomplete inhibition of protein synthesis allowed some continued production of the enzyme. LPL activity dropped rapidly after cycloheximide was given. This is in accord with earlier studies in vivo (7Bergö M. Wu G. Ruge T. Olivecrona T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11927-11932Google Scholar, 22Schotz M.C. Garfinkel A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 106: 202-205Google Scholar, 23Cryer A. Foster B. Wing D.R. Robinson D.S. Biochem. J. 1973; 132: 833-836Google Scholar) and with cells (16Ben-Zeev O. Mao H.Z. Doolittle M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10727-10738Google Scholar, 24Semb H. Olivecrona T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 104-115Google Scholar). In the fed rats, LPL activity dropped at a similar rate as LPL mass (Fig. 2, upper panel). The much lower activity in the fasted rats also dropped. To be able to compare the rates between the nutritional states we recalculated the data as percent of initial activity (Fig. 2, inset). When expressed in this way, the LPL activities decreased at virtually the same rate in the two nutritional states. The loss of LPL mass and activity during the initial rapid phase (about 2 h) and the height of the subsequent slow phase differed between experiments, presumably due to variation in the extent to which protein synthesis was inhibited. It was not feasible to isolate adipocytes from all the animals in the experiment in Fig. 2. Therefore a separate experiment was carried out at a single time point (Fig. 3). In this experiment, LPL mass decreased by 45–557 in 90 min, compared with about 757 in 2 h in the experiment in Fig. 2. The percentage loss of LPL mass was similar for tissue total, for adipocytes, and for calculated extracellular LPL mass (Fig. 3, lower panel). LPL activity decreased by 53 and 477 in whole tissue and by 52 and 427 in adipocytes from fed and fasted rats, respectively (Fig. 3, upper panel). These differences were not statistically significant. In any case, this experiment shows that all four pools of LPL, active/inactive, intra/extracellular, turn over rapidly and at similar fractional rates. Many studies have shown that LPL is released from its endothelial binding sites by heparin (1Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Google Scholar, 2Olivecrona T. Olivecrona G. Betteridge D.J. Illingworth D.R. Shepherd J. Lipoproteins in Health and Disease. Arnold, London1999: 223-246Google Scholar). We questioned how much and what fraction of the total tissue LPL could be released by perfusion with heparin. For this we injected heparin and measured tissue LPL mass and activity at a series of times (Fig.4). There was a gradual decline of LPL activity with time. This was more pronounced in tissues from fed rats, from 1700–800 milliunits/g in 60 min compared with 700–600 milliunits/g in fasted rats. In contrast, there was no change in the activity within adipocytes. Hence, heparin mobilized a large fraction of the extracellular enzyme, but none of the intracellular. The inset in Fig. 4 shows the percent change in extracellular activity with time after heparin injection. When the data were expressed in this way, the decline of activity followed the same time course for fed and fasted rats, and the percent of the initial extracellular activity that was lost over the 60 min studied was also the same, about 607 in both fed and fasted rats. The changes in LPL mass (Fig. 4, lower panel) followed the same trends as for LPL activity. Heparin extracted more LPL mass in the fed compared with the fasted rats, and the changes occurred only in the extracellular portion. Within the adipocytes, LPL mass remained constant. The specific activity of tissue LPL was 0.93 milliunit/ng in the fed rats and 0.39 milliunit/ng in the fasted rats. A calculation of the specific activity for the enzyme that was lost from the tissue in 60 min after heparin injection returns values of 1.8 milliunits/ng in the fed and 1.7 milliunits/ng in the fasted rats. These figures carry a large uncertainty since they were calculated as the ratio of differences between rather large values. Furthermore, they do not take into account the LPL that was produced and released from the adipocytes during the 1-h experiment. Nonetheless, the figures indicate that heparin released only, or at least mainly, the active species of LPL. This study shows that most of the LPL protein in adipose tissue is located extracellularly, irrespective of the nutritional state. Some earlier studies had indicated that regulation of LPL activity is exerted by changes in the proportion of newly synthesized enzyme that is secreted from the cells (9Doolittle M.H. Ben-Zeev O. Elovson J. Martin D. Kirchgessner T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4570-4577Google Scholar, 12Lee J.J. Smith P.J. Fried S.K. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 940-946Google Scholar, 25Garfinkel A.G. Nilsson-Ehle P. Schotz M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 424: 264-273Google Scholar). If so, the larger amount of inactive LPL in adipose tissue of fasted rats would be expected to be present within adipocytes, retained in the ER. The specific activity of intracellular LPL would be lower in fasted compared with fed rats, whereas the specific activity of the extracellular enzyme would be similar in both nutritional states. In contrast to these predictions, we found that the specific activity of intracellular LPL remained the same. It was the specific activity of the extracellular enzyme that changed. A confounding factor could have been that the turnover rates for the different pools of LPL changed with the nutritional state. In fasted rats an increased turnover rate for inactive LPL in adipocytes might compensate so that mass remained relatively constant even though more enzyme was retained in the ER. Conversely, the turnover rate of extracellular LPL would have to be slower in fasted rats so that mass remained high even though secretion was reduced. We did not, however, find any marked differences with nutritional state in the turnover rates for any of the pools of LPL. Our data thus indicate that the nutritional regulation of adipose LPL is exerted on the activity state of the extracellular enzyme. Ben-Zeev et al. recently studied the synthesis and maturation of human LPL transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells (16Ben-Zeev O. Mao H.Z. Doolittle M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10727-10738Google Scholar). A large fraction of newly synthesized LPL was retained in the ER, formed disulfide-linked aggregates, and was degraded through an energy-dependent pathway. In concert with this, we found that about 707 of LPL protein within the adipocytes was inactive. In a pulse-chase study with guinea pig adipocytes, Semb and Olivecrona found that 657 of newly synthesized LPL was degraded within 4 h (24Semb H. Olivecrona T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 104-115Google Scholar). Speake et al. (26Speake B.K. Parkin S.M. Robinson D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 840: 419-422Google Scholar) and Lee et al. (12Lee J.J. Smith P.J. Fried S.K. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 940-946Google Scholar) have also shown that LPL is degraded in rat adipose tissue. All these data are in agreement with the hypothesis that a large fraction of newly synthesized LPL protein does not fold correctly, is therefore rejected by ER quality control mechanisms (27Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Google Scholar), aggregates, and is degraded within the ER. The active species made up about 307 of total LPL protein in the adipocytes. From the pattern of glycosylation Been-Zeev et al. concluded that most of the catalytically active LPL molecules were still in the ER (16Ben-Zeev O. Mao H.Z. Doolittle M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10727-10738Google Scholar). Roh et al. separated different intracellular structures from rat adipocytes by centrifugation (28Roh C. Roduit R. Thorens B. Fried S. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35990-35994Google Scholar). They found that LPL was mainly in the ER with a small pool being present in low-density membrane vesicles that probably represent a secretory compartment in adipocytes. In pulse-chase experiments with guinea pig adipocytes, Semb and Olivecrona found that about one-third of pulse-labeled LPL had appeared in the medium within 30 min of chase (24Semb H. Olivecrona T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 104-115Google Scholar). This figure rose to 497 by 1 h. After that there was no further appearance of labeled LPL in the medium. These data suggest that when the LPL molecules have been cleared by the quality control system, they move rapidly to the cell surface. Several laboratories have reported that short-term changes of LPL activity in adipose tissue occur without corresponding changes in LPL mRNA (9Doolittle M.H. Ben-Zeev O. Elovson J. Martin D. Kirchgessner T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4570-4577Google Scholar, 29Enerbäck S. Semb H. Tavernier J. Bjursell G. Olivecrona T. Gene. 1988; 64: 97-106Google Scholar), relative rates of LPL biosynthesis (8Semb H. Olivecrona T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 878: 330-337Google Scholar, 12Lee J.J. Smith P.J. Fried S.K. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 940-946Google Scholar), or LPL mass ((9, 15). There are also reports that LPL activity in adipocytes isolated from fed or fasted rats is about the same (30Cunningham V.J. Robinson D.S. Biochem. J. 1969; 112: 203-209Google Scholar). In concert with this, we found no difference in adipocyte LPL activity with nutritional state. In addition, our data show that there was no difference with nutritional state in LPL mass or in the distribution of LPL protein between inactive and active forms within the adipocytes. To gain information on where in the tissue the extracellular LPL is localized we injected heparin. Tissue LPL activity decreased by only about 107 during the first 2 min. This presumably represented the LPL molecules that were at the endothelial surface (17Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Metabolism. 1988; 37: 597-601Google Scholar, 31Nilsson-Ehle P. Garfinkel A.S. Schotz M.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 667-693Google Scholar, 32Borensztajn J. Borensztajn J. Lipoprotein Lipase. Evener, Chicago1987: 133-148Google Scholar). Over the next 60 min an additional 407 of the LPL activity disappeared from the tissue. That tissue LPL activity continued to decrease long after of the endothelial-bound enzyme had been released supports the view that there is a relatively large pool of LPL molecules that recirculate between the luminal surface of the endothelium and extravascular sites in the tissue (1Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Google Scholar, 2Olivecrona T. Olivecrona G. Betteridge D.J. Illingworth D.R. Shepherd J. Lipoproteins in Health and Disease. Arnold, London1999: 223-246Google Scholar). Calculation of the specific activity indicated that heparin extracted mainly, or perhaps only, the active form of the enzyme. This is expected since only this form has high affinity for heparin/heparan sulfate (33Lookene A. Chevreuil O. Ostergaard P. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12155-12163Google Scholar). That heparin releases primarily the active form of LPL is in concert with an earlier study on the specific activity of the LPL released into blood after injection of heparin (34Olivecrona G. Hultin M. Savonen R. Skottova N. Lookene A. Tugrul Y. Olivecrona T. Woodford F.P. Davignon J. Sniderman A.D. Atherosclerosis X. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). One hour after injection of heparin, tissue LPL activity had decreased by about 507. This corresponds to more than two-thirds of the extracellular LPL activity. In contrast, LPL activity within the adipocytes did not change. This differs from what is usually seen in experiments with cultured cells where heparin increases the release of LPL activity to the medium at the expense of cell-associated LPL (16Ben-Zeev O. Mao H.Z. Doolittle M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10727-10738Google Scholar,24Semb H. Olivecrona T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 104-115Google Scholar, 35Cryer A. Davies P. Williams E.R. Robinson D.S. Biochem. J. 1975; 146: 481-488Google Scholar). The mechanism for this enhanced release is presumably that heparin acts as a soluble ligand for the enzyme and prevents its recycling into the cells (36Cupp M. Bensadoun A. Melford K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6383-6388Google Scholar, 37Friedman G. Chajek-Shaul T. Olivecrona T. Stein O. Stein Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 711: 114-122Google Scholar). One might have expected a similar process in the tissue, i.e. that heparin would drive the enzyme out from the cells toward the endothelium. That this did not happen indicates that even without exogenous heparin there is an excess of liganding sites in the tissue to receive the enzyme as it emerges from the adipocytes. Heparin released more than five times as much LPL activity from the adipose tissue of fed compared with fasted rats. When we calculated the release as fraction of the active, extracellular LPL in the tissue (Fig. 4, inset), the time course and extent of release was similar for the two nutritional states. This indicates that the active, extracellular LPL was equally accessible to release by heparin in both nutritional states. Hence, the larger release in the fed rats was a reflection of the larger amount of active extracellular LPL rather than due to some difference in how the enzyme was located in the tissue. In a recent study we found that down-regulation of LPL activity in adipose tissue during fasting requires that a gene, separate from the lipase gene, is switched on (7Bergö M. Wu G. Ruge T. Olivecrona T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11927-11932Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the product of this gene accomplishes the switch from predominantly active to predominantly inactive form(s) of LPL is not clear. Here we show that the switch primarily affects the extracellular LPL. In vivoexperiments, as used here, are too complex to unravel the mechanism. Studies with adipocytes have shown relatively small or no differences in LPL activity and secretion between cells from fasted compared with fed rats (12Lee J.J. Smith P.J. Fried S.K. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 940-946Google Scholar, 24Semb H. Olivecrona T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 104-115Google Scholar, 25Garfinkel A.G. Nilsson-Ehle P. Schotz M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 424: 264-273Google Scholar, 35Cryer A. Davies P. Williams E.R. Robinson D.S. Biochem. J. 1975; 146: 481-488Google Scholar, 38Spencer I.M. Hutchinson A. Robinson D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 530: 375-384Google Scholar, 39Lasuncion M.A. Herrera E. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 639-643Google Scholar). The next step must therefore be to find a suitable cell system and/or conditions where the putative LPL-regulating gene can be switched on and off and the effects on LPL maturation, trafficking, and stability can be studied in detail."

In the present study we examined theN-nitrosation of N-terminal-blocked (N-blocked) tryptophan derivatives in the presence of N2O3 generating systems, such as preformed nitric oxide and nitric oxide donor compounds in the presence of oxygen at pH 7.4. Under these conditionsN-nitrosation of N-acetyltryptophan and lysine-tryptophan-lysine, respectively, was proven unequivocally by UV-visible spectroscopy as well as 15N NMR spectrometry. Competition experiments performed with the known N2O3 scavenger morpholine demonstrated that the selected tryptophan derivatives were nitrosated by N2O3 with similar rate constants. It is further shown that the addition of ascorbate (vitamin C) induced the release of nitric oxide from N-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan as monitored polarographically with a NO electrode. Theoretical considerations strongly suggested that the reactivity of protein-bound tryptophan would be high enough to compete effectively with protein-bound cysteine for N2O3.

Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142Google Scholar). In mammals the basal level of ⋅NO (in the aqueous phase) is in the nanomolar range (2Goldstein S. Czapski G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3419-3425Google Scholar). However, the local ⋅NO concentrations can be increased substantially in areas with high NO synthase activity and/or in hydrophobic regions (3Nedospasov A.

Lamas S. Fang F.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 675-683Google Scholar and references therein). For instance,S-nitrosothiols can operate as nitric oxide-donating compounds in vitro (Equation 5 (10Holmes A.J. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 2000; 2: 1639-1644Google Scholar)), and they are believed to induce ⋅NO-like biological activities in vivo, probably by releasing ⋅NO (11Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Google Scholar, 12Ignarro L.J. Lipton H. Edwards J.C. Baricos W.H.

Dittman A. Villacres E. Choi E. Storm D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7290-7296Google Scholar). In addition to thiols, secondary amines also react rapidly with N2O3 (7Williams D.L.H. Nitrosation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1986Google Scholar). Consequently, the question arose whether (protein-bound) tryptophan could be nitrosated at the nitrogen atom of the indole ring at physiological pH 7.4. It has been demonstrated recently that melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is N-nitrosated by NaNO2/HCl as well as by ⋅NO/O2 at pH 7.4. However, the reported rate constant for the latter reaction is rather low (k(melatonin + ⋅NO) = 0.5m−1s−1) (19Blanchard B. Pompon D. Ducrocq C. J. Pineal Res. 2000; 29: 184-192Google Scholar). Keeping the low physiological concentrations of melatonin in mind (e.g. the maximal concentration in human serum is ∼75 pg/ml (20Arendt J. Wirz J.A. Bradtke J. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1979; 16: 307-312Google Scholar)), this reaction therefore should not proceed to a significant extent in vivo. A similar reaction has not been established thus far for tryptophan at pH 7.4. However, there are indications that the secondary amine of tryptophan (Nindole) can be nitrosated when the primary amine function (Nalanine) is N-blocked.1 Consequently, albumin (3Nedospasov A. Rafikov R. Beda N. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13543-13548Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y.Y. Xu A.-M. Nomen M. Walsh M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Loscalzo J. J. Biol.

Biomed. Sci. 2001; 9: 47-58Google Scholar) or, more simply, N-acetyltryptophan (24Bonnett R. Holleyhead R. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1974; 1: 962-964Google Scholar) were N-nitrosated by N2O3 generatedin situ by HCl/NaNO2 (SchemeFS1). Nitrosamines in general are well known carcinogens (25Lijinski W. Epstein S.S. Nature. 1970; 255: 21-23Google Scholar). Similarly, Venitt et al.(26Venitt S. Crofton-Sleigh C. Ooi S.L. Bonnett R. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 523-532Google Scholar) observed mutagenic effects ofN-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan in bacteria. On the other side, as protein-bound N-nitrosotryptophan was able to both stimulate vasorelaxation and inhibit platelet aggregation (21Zhang Y.Y. Xu A.-M. Nomen M. Walsh M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Loscalzo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14271-14279Google Scholar), there might be a putative physiological significance ofN-nitrosotryptophan derivatives. This idea, however, has not been developed further, probably because thiols are now believed to be the main physiological targets for N2O3 in proteins. In contrast to this opinion, we demonstrate unequivocally here the N2O3-mediated nitrosation of N-blocked tryptophan (N-acetyltryptophan and the tripeptide lysine-tryptophan-lysine) by N2O3 at physiological pH 7.4. In addition, competition experiments performed with the common N2O3 scavenger morpholine demonstrate that N2O3 reacts quickly with N-terminal-blocked tryptophan. Finally, as liberation of ⋅NO is evident after reaction ofN-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan with ascorbate,N-nitrosotryptophan is expected to exhibit similar⋅NO-donating capabilities asS-nitrosocysteine. l-Tryptophan,N-acetyltryptophan, melatonin, lysine-tryptophan-lysine,l-cysteine, morpholine, piperazine and15N-labeled sodium nitrite were obtained from Sigma. MAMA NONOate and spermine NONOate were purchased from Situs (Düsseldorf, Germany). Because nitrosation reactions are sensitive to the presence of metal ions, solutions were exposed to chelating resin (Chelex 100) as described previously (27Kirsch M. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16702-16708Google Scholar). Nitric oxide (14⋅NO) or 15N- labeled nitric oxide (15⋅NO) was prepared daily by the addition of glacial acetic acid to an aqueous solution of K4[Fe(CN)6] (0.7 m) containing either NaNO2 or Na15NO2 (0.72m) under oxygen-free conditions. The overall stoichiometry is presented by the equation, K4[Fe(CN)6]+Na15NO2+2CH3COOH→K3[Fe(CN)6]+CH3COOK+CH3COONa+H2O+15·NOEquation 6 The reliability of this procedure was confirmed by detecting the release of nitric oxide polarographically with a graphite nitric oxide-sensing electrode (World Precision Instruments, Berlin, Germany). N-blocked derivatives of tryptophan were nitrosated in oxygen-saturated phosphate/triglycine buffer (250/25 mm, pH 8.0) with the above described preformed⋅NO gas by bubbling it gently into the solution through a needle until the pH value had dropped to 7.4. MAMA NONOate and spermine NONOate were prepared as 100-fold stock solutions in 10 mmNaOH at 4 °C and used immediately. A stock solution of nitrosocysteine was prepared by S-nitrosation of 100 mm cysteine with equimolar amounts of NaNO2 in acidic solution (pH 2) at 0 °C (24Bonnett R. Holleyhead R. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1974; 1: 962-964Google Scholar). Nitrosation reactions were performed in 1 ml of potassium phosphate/NaHCO3/CO2 buffer (50 mm/25 mm/57, pH 7.4, 37 °C) in 35-mm dishes. Substances were exposed to equimolar concentrations of sodium nitrite in H2O equilibrated with glacial acetic acid to pH 3.5. Immediately after nitrosation, sample aliquots were supplemented with 107 D2O and analyzed by 15N NMR spectrometry. The adducts were identified by 50.67 MHz15N NMR spectrometry on a Bruker AVANCE DRX 500 instrument. Chemical shifts (δ) are given in ppm relative to neat nitromethane (δ = 0) as the external standard. Morpholine (0–100 mm) or piperazine (0–20 mm) and l-tryptophan (2 mm) or its derivatives were incubated with 0.5 mm MAMA NONOate in potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5, 37 °C) for 30 min. The reaction products were analyzed spectrophotometrically at 335 nm (or 346 nm for nitrosomelatonin) with a SPECORD S 100 spectrophotometer from Analytik Jena (Jena, Germany). A similar experiment was carried out with piperazine as the competitor. Control experiments demonstrated that transnitrosation reactions did not proceed at this pH between nitrosomorpholine + N-acetyltryptophan, nitrosopiperazine + N-acetyltryptophan, morpholine +N-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan, or piperazine +N-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan, in line with observations reported by Meyer et al. (28Meyer T. Williams D. Bonnett R. Ooi S. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1982; 2: 1383-1387Google Scholar). The decay kinetics ofN-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan (100 ॖm) at various temperatures (15–45 °C) were determined in air-tight quartz cuvettes by rapid scan monitoring the UV-visible absorption at λmax = 335 nm (ε335 = 6100m−1cm−1) (24Bonnett R. Holleyhead R. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1974; 1: 962-964Google Scholar). Between recordings the samples were protected from light. The temperature was maintained at ± 0.1 °C. Evidence exists that under acidic conditions similar to those in the stomach the NaNO2-dependent nitrosation of human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, or the dipeptide glycine-tryptophan yields N-nitrosotryptophan (21Zhang Y.Y. Xu A.-M. Nomen M. Walsh M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Loscalzo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14271-14279Google Scholar, 23Harohalli K. Petersen C.E. Ha C.-E. Feix J.B. Bhagavan N.V. J. Biomed. Sci. 2001; 9: 47-58Google Scholar). The main nitrosating species in this reaction is postulated to be dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) formed from HNO2 dehydration (7Williams D.L.H. Nitrosation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1986Google Scholar, 29Garcia-Santos M.D. Gonzales-Mancebo S. Hernandez-Benito J. Calle E. Casado J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2177-2182Google Scholar). Provided that this is indeed the case, N2O3 formed from ⋅NO in the presence of oxygen at pH 7.4 should also nitrosateN-terminal-blocked tryptophan derivatives, likeN-acetyltryptophan and peptide-associated tryptophan (lysine-tryptophan-lysine). To verify the nitrosation of N-blocked tryptophan derivatives by N2O3 at pH 7.4, we selected various N2O3-generating systems. We employed preformed nitric oxide as well as in situ generation of ⋅NO from S-nitrosocysteine and spermine NONOate, respectively. In these systems, N2O3 is formed from oxidation of nitric oxide (⋅NO autoxidation) according to Equations 1 and2 (see the Introduction). Because the formation ofN-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan from the reaction ofN-acetyltryptophan with NaNO2 at pH 3.5 has been described in detail (24Bonnett R. Holleyhead R. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1974; 1: 962-964Google Scholar, 30Bonnett R. Nicolaidou P. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin. 1979; I: 1969-1974Google Scholar), we used this reaction as a reference system. In analogy to the data of Bonnett and Holleyhead (24Bonnett R. Holleyhead R. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1974; 1: 962-964Google Scholar) we recorded the UV-visible spectrum ofN-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan with an absorption maximum at 335 nm (Fig. 1A, trace b). Interestingly, an almost identical UV-visible spectrum was observed when N-acetyltryptophan was allowed to react with preformed nitric oxide in the presence of oxygen at physiological pH 7.4 (Fig. 1A, trace e). This finding indicated very strongly that N2O3 can indeed nitrosate the secondary amine of the indole system in tryptophan. Likewise, the UV-visible spectrum of N-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan was also detected during reaction of N-acetyltryptophan with the above mentioned nitric oxide-donating compounds in the presence of air (Fig.1A, traces c and d). Because in vivo N-terminal-blocked tryptophan is present primarily in proteins, the N2O3-mediated nitrosation of the nitrogen atom of the indole ring was also investigated for peptide-bound tryptophan by employing lysine-tryptophan-lysine. In full agreement with the experiments performed with N-acetyltryptophan (see above), all applied N2O3-generating systems were able to nitrosate peptide-bound tryptophan effectively at the selected pH values (Fig.1B). In contrast, the nitrosation ofl-tryptophan by the N2O3-generating systems was much less effective (data not shown), which is in line with data from the literature (28Meyer T. Williams D. Bonnett R. Ooi S. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1982; 2: 1383-1387Google Scholar,30Bonnett R. Nicolaidou P. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin. 1979; I: 1969-1974Google Scholar). Conclusively, only N-terminal-blocked tryptophan but notl-tryptophan is a relevant target for N2O3 at physiological pH. Because UV-visible absorption spectra cannot provide unambiguous evidence that the secondary amine function of the indole ring was truly nitrosated, we used 15N NMR spectrometry as a more reliable analytical tool. In 1986, Dorie et al. (31Dorie J. Gouesnard J.P. Mechin B. Mellet P. J. Mol. Struct. 1986; 144: 185-189Google Scholar) recorded the 15N NMR spectrum of 15N-labeledN-acetyl-[15N]nitrosotryptophan from the reaction of N-acetyltryptophan with Na15NO2 at pH 4. As commonly observed forN-nitroso compounds (32Witanowski M. Stefaniak L. Webb G.A. Webb G.A. Annual Reports on NMR Spectroscopy. 25. Academic Press, London1993Google Scholar) the 15N NMR spectrum exhibited two resonances, at 184.6 and 169.6 ppm relative to neat nitromethane, of the Z- and E-conformer ofN-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan, respectively. Fig.2A shows the 15N NMR spectrum of preformed (authentic)N-acetyl-15N-nitrosotryptophan at pH 7.4, exhibiting two resonance lines at 180.8 and 166.3 ppm, respectively. The small shift difference of ∼3 ppm compared with the data of Dorieet al. (31Dorie J. Gouesnard J.P. Mechin B. Mellet P. J. Mol. Struct. 1986; 144: 185-189Google Scholar) may be explained by differences in the recording conditions, e.g. different pH values as well as improvements of the 15N NMR spectrometric techniques during the past years. Nevertheless, nitrosation of the nitrogen atom at the indole ring is proven by this characteristic 15N NMR spectrum. When N-acetyltryptophan was reacted with authentic15NO in the presence of oxygen, only the two new15N NMR resonances at 180.1 and 165.6 ppm were detected, consistent with the formation ofN-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan (Fig.2B). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct proof that a tryptophan derivative can be nitrosated by N2O3 at the nitrogen atom of the indole system at physiological pH. Analogous to N-acetyltryptophan the tripeptide lysine-tryptophan-lysine was nitrosated at pH 7.4 by preformed15NO as proven by the 15N NMR resonance lines at 181.1 and 166.7 ppm, respectively (Fig. 2C). For a discussion of the putative significance of tryptophan nitrosation in vivo it is necessary to determine the rate constants of the reaction of N-acetyltryptophan or its derivatives with N2O3at pH 7.5. As mentioned above, Blanchard et al. (19Blanchard B. Pompon D. Ducrocq C. J. Pineal Res. 2000; 29: 184-192Google Scholar) reported that melatonin reacts with ⋅NO in the presence of oxygen at pH 7.4 with a second-order rate constant of only 0.5m−1 s−1. However, these experiments were performed in the presence of 200 mm Hepes buffer, which is known to react with reactive nitrogen/oxygen species to yield both H2O2 (33Kirsch M. Lomonosova E.E. Korth H.-G. Sustmann R. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12716-12724Google Scholar, 34Lomonosova L.L. Kirsch M. Rauen U. de Groot H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 522-528Google Scholar) and a⋅NO-donating compound (35Schmidt K. Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 859-862Google Scholar). Therefore we evaluated the rate constants of N-nitrosation of N-blocked tryptophan derivatives with N2O3 by a competition method employing morpholine as the N2O3 scavenger (2Goldstein S. Czapski G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3419-3425Google Scholar,36Lewis R.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Deen W.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3933-3939Google Scholar, 37Kirsch M. Korth H.-G. Sustmann R. de Groot H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 451-461Google Scholar). The reaction of 2 mmN-acetyltryptophan with 0.5 mm MAMA NONOate yielded about 360 ॖmN-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan. Morpholine competitively inhibited the MAMA NONOate-induced nitrosation ofN-acetyltryptophan in a nonlinear manner with an IC50 value of 13.4 mm (Fig.3). The protonated form of morpholine, that is morpholinium, with a pKa value of 8.23 at 37 °C (38Hetzer H.B. Bates R.G. Robinson R.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 70: 2869-2872Google Scholar), is not expected to react with N2O3 (39Lewis R.S. Tamir S. Tannenbaum S.R. Deen W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29350-29355Google Scholar). Thus, the fraction of unprotonated morpholine is about 15.77 at pH 7.5. Taking this fraction into account, the true IC50 value is given by 13.4 mm × 0.157 = 2.1 mm. Conclusively, as 2 mmN-acetyltryptophan was used (see above), N2O3 reacts at 37 °C with virtually identical rate constant with both N-acetyltryptophan and morpholine. To verify the presumption that only the unprotonated fraction of the secondary amine effectively reacts with N2O3, a control experiment was performed with piperazine as a competitive N2O3 scavenger. At pH 7.5 about 997 of piperazine (pKa = 5.55 (7Williams D.L.H. Nitrosation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1986Google Scholar)) exists in the unprotonated form; thus, as expected, piperazine was more effective than morpholine in inhibiting the MAMA NONOate-induced nitrosation of N-acetyltryptophan (Fig. 3). From inspection of Fig. 3 it can be deduced that MAMA NONOate-induced nitrosation ofN-acetyltryptophan was half-maximally inhibited at a piperazine concentration of 2.7 mm. The observation that the corrected IC50 value of morpholine is lower than the experimental IC50 value of piperazine (TableI) is in agreement with the report that N2O3 reacts faster with morpholine than with piperazine (7Williams D.L.H. Nitrosation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1986Google Scholar). Not unexpectedly, the reactivity of other N-terminal-blocked tryptophan derivatives toward N2O3 was found to be similar (Table I). To compare the rate constant of these nitrosation reactions with other nitrosation reactions reported in the literature, one experiment withN-acetyltryptophan was performed at 25 °C and a rate constant of 4.4 × 107m−1s−1 was obtained. Thus, N-blocked tryptophan reacts rather fast with N2O3 (see the Discussion).Table IRate data for the reaction of tryptophan derivatives with N2O3N2O3targetCompetitorTIC50 (apparent)IC50 (corrected)1-aCorrected for the concentration of the operating amine.k× 107 (apparent)2 mm°Cmmmmm−1s−1N-AcetyltryptophanMorpholine3713.42.16.4N-AcetyltryptophanPiperazine372.72.7NC1-bNot calculable.TripeptideMorpholine3714.82.36.4N-AcetyltryptophanMorpholine2515.01.44.4MelatoninMorpholine3723.43.09.21-a Corrected for the concentration of the operating amine.1-b Not calculable. Open table in a new tab In contrast to common, stable nitrosamines, protein-boundN-nitrosotryptophan has been reported to undergo slow decay at pH 2 (23Harohalli K. Petersen C.E. Ha C.-E. Feix J.B. Bhagavan N.V. J. Biomed. Sci. 2001; 9: 47-58Google Scholar). To quantify this capability at pH 7.4, we analyzed the decomposition of N-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan by monitoring its absorption at 335 nm. At 37 °CN-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan decayed in a first-order manner (Fig. 4A). Similarly, first-order decay kinetics were also observed at other temperatures (15–45 °C, data not shown). From the excellent Arrhenius plot of the rate data (Fig. 4B) an activation barrier of Ea = 13.2 ± 0.1 kcal mol−1 and an A-factor of 1.7 ± 0.3 × 105 s−1 were extracted. ThisA-factor appears to be extremely low for a simple first-order (homolysis) decomposition. From the Arrhenius parameters the half-life of N-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan at physiological conditions (T = 37 °C, pH 7.4) can be calculated to 140 min. Thus, the N-nitrosamines of N-blocked tryptophan derivatives are rather long-lived intermediates. Because the half-life of peptide-bound N-nitrosotryptophan was found to be similar to that ofN-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan (data not shown), one may ask whether it would make any sense for physiological functions to nitrosate tryptophan in vivo. Recently, Harohalliet al. (23Harohalli K. Petersen C.E. Ha C.-E. Feix J.B. Bhagavan N.V. J. Biomed. Sci. 2001; 9: 47-58Google Scholar) reported thatN-nitrosotryptophan very slowly releases ⋅NO at pH 2, and Blanchard-Fillion et al. (40Blanchard-Fillion B. Servy C. Ducrocq C. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 35: 857-866Google Scholar) observed that nitrosomelatonin spontaneously decays at pH 7.4, thereby releasing nitric oxide at a yield of 717. In our hands, however, authentic nitrosomelatonin released only negligible amounts of nitric oxide on decomposition in Hepes-free buffer solution (data not shown). Noticeably neither Harohalli et al. (23Harohalli K. Petersen C.E. Ha C.-E. Feix J.B. Bhagavan N.V. J. Biomed. Sci. 2001; 9: 47-58Google Scholar) nor Blanchard-Fillion et al. (40Blanchard-Fillion B. Servy C. Ducrocq C. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 35: 857-866Google Scholar) directly detected ⋅NO,e.g. with a NO electrode. As nitrosothiols release nitric oxide in the presence of vitamin C (10Holmes A.J. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 2000; 2: 1639-1644Google Scholar), we compared the potential of ascorbate to induce ⋅NO release from S-nitrosoglutathione versus N-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan (Fig.5). In the absence of copper ions, the release of ⋅NO fromN-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan after the addition of ascorbate was about 5-fold higher than fromS-nitrosoglutathione. In contrast, a 舡simple舠N-nitrosamine like N-nitrosomorpholine did not liberate nitric oxide under similar conditions (data not shown). The low ⋅NO-releasing efficiency of S-nitrosoglutathione is explained by the rigorous depletion of copper ions in the applied buffer solution. In the presence of 10 ॖmCu2+, however, S-nitrosoglutathione as well asN-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan did release nitric oxide with nearly the same yield in the presence of ascorbate (data not shown). In the absence of vitamin C only negligible amounts of nitric oxide were released from eitherN-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan orS-nitrosoglutathione on decomposition. These results demonstrate unequivocally thatN-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan has nitric oxide-releasing capabilities similar to those ofS-nitrosocysteine. The results presented above clearly show that N2O3 nitrosates the secondary amine function at the indole ring of N-blocked tryptophan with high reactivity at physiological pH values. It is known that indole and indole derivatives are easily attacked by N2O3 under acidic conditions, however, with exclusive C-nitrosation, thus yielding 3-nitroso products (30Bonnett R. Nicolaidou P. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin. 1979; I: 1969-1974Google Scholar, 41Challis B.C. Lawson A.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1972; 2: 918-925Google Scholar). Such products were not observed for tryptophan because here the C-3 position is blocked by the alanine residue, rendering nitrosation at position N-1 (Nindole) more feasible. Nitrosation at C-2 is possible only for derivatives carrying powerful electron donors at the C-3 position (30Bonnett R. Nicolaidou P. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin. 1979; I: 1969-1974Google Scholar). Our data indicate that N-acetyltryptophan, melatonin, and the tripeptide lysine-tryptophan-lysine are nitrosated directly by N2O3 because these nitrosation reactions could be inhibited effectively by the N2O3 scavengers morpholine and piperazine, respectively. In contrast, Turjanski et al. (42Turjanski A.G. Leonik F. Estrin D.A. Rosenstein R.E. Doctorovich F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 10468-10469Google Scholar) reported that melatonin is nitrosated mainly by a combined attack of the radicals ⋅NO2 and ⋅NO. It should be noted that such a mechanism has never been proven for ordinary amines and that a variety of side products, i.e. N-nitro, C-nitro, and C-nitroso compounds, had to be produced by an operating radical mechanism. Noticeably, the 15N NMR data demonstrated that reaction of15N2O3 with N-blocked tryptophan exclusively yields 15N-nitrosotryptophan. Recently, the reaction between albumin and N2O3generated from NaNO2 at low pH has been monitored by UV spectroscopy. On the basis of these measurements it was assumed that tryptophan would be nitrosated also (21Zhang Y.Y. Xu A.-M. Nomen M. Walsh M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Loscalzo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14271-14279Google Scholar, 23Harohalli K. Petersen C.E. Ha C.-E. Feix J.B. Bhagavan N.V. J. Biomed. Sci. 2001; 9: 47-58Google Scholar). However, this conclusion has not been generally accepted (22Noble D.R. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 2001; 2: 13-17Google Scholar, 43Feelisch M. Rassaf T. Mnaimneh S. Singh N. Bryan N.S. Jourd'heuil D. Kelm M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Google Scholar). As there is presently no specific test for N-nitrosotryptophan available and becauseN-nitrosotryptophan derivatives andS-nitrosocysteine have almost identical UV-visible absorption spectra (λmax ∼335 (24Bonnett R. Holleyhead R. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1974; 1: 962-964Google Scholar) and ∼340 nm (30Bonnett R. Nicolaidou P. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin. 1979; I: 1969-1974Google Scholar), respectively), the efficiency of nitrosation of both tryptophan and cysteine in proteins is hard to verify experimentally by UV-visible spectroscopy. On the other hand, the effectiveness of these reactions can reasonably be estimated on the basis of the experimental rate constants and the concentrations of both amino acids in proteins. At physiological pH values, tryptophan exists practically exclusively in the reactive nonprotonated form. Hence, the rate constant of N2O3 with protein-bound tryptophan can be assumed to be k = 4.4 × 107m−1s−1 (see 舡Results舠). In contrast, thiols are only marginally deprotonated at pH 7.4. From the average pKa values of ∼8.2 of thiolates in proteins (22Noble D.R. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 2001; 2: 13-17Google Scholar), it can be deduced that only 13.57 of the cysteine residues are viable targets for N2O3. Thus, as the rate constants for reaction of thiolates (RS−) with N2O3 is aboutk = 2 × 108m−1s−1 (2Goldstein S. Czapski G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3419-3425Google Scholar), protein-bound cysteine should react at pH 7.4 with N2O3 with a rate constant of k (cysteine + N2O3) = 2 × 108m−1s−1 × 0.135 = 2.7 × 107m−1s−1. Thus, the rate constant of the reaction of protein-bound tryptophan with N2O3 is, somewhat unexpectedly, estimated to be about 637 higher than the rate constant of protein-bound cysteine with N2O3. To verify that this conclusion can be extended to the reaction rate, the amounts of both tryptophan and cysteine residues in proteins were verified by searching the RCSB Protein Data Bank (44Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Google Scholar) for those proteins that are believed to beS-nitrosated (Table II). From the data in Table II it can be deduced that in the selected proteins the total amount of cysteine is higher than the total amount of tryptophan. With regard to the differences in the rate constants (see above), one can now estimate that N2O3 reacts primarily (40–907) with tryptophan. Thus, we hypothesized that protein-bound tryptophan should be preferentially nitrosated under physiological conditions. To verify this prediction, we are currently developing highly sensitive protocols for the detection of bothN-nitrosotryptophan and S-nitrosothiols in proteins.Table IITryptophan and cysteine residues in proteins which may be subject to S-nitrosation in physiological regulation mechanismsProtein2-aRandomly selected from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (44).TryptophanCysteineReferencesTissue transglutaminase3017(50Lai T.S.

Open table in a new tab In this paper we have demonstrated additionally thatN-nitrosotryptophan has the capability of releasing nitric oxide in the presence of ascorbate. This implies thatN-nitrosotryptophan might operate as a nitric oxide carrier, a property that to date has been attributed more or less exclusively toS-nitrosothiols (7Williams D.L.H. Nitrosation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1986Google Scholar, 11Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mullins M. Singel D. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8087-8091Google Scholar). However, as the chemistry of N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives in physiological environment is not very well developed, it is as yet too early to consider N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives as 舡harmless舠 compounds in biological systems. It might be assumed that potentially harmful reactive nitrogen species like peroxynitrite (40Blanchard-Fillion B. Servy C. Ducrocq C. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 35: 857-866Google Scholar) or N2O3 are deactivated by their reaction with tryptophan residues and that this may them give some antioxidative functions. However, the observation of Venitt et al. (26Venitt S. Crofton-Sleigh C. Ooi S.L. Bonnett R. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 523-532Google Scholar) that N-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan at 5–15 mm induces mutagenicity in bacteria is, in our view, easily explained by its capability of releasing nitric oxide, which is known to induce such effects at unphysiologically high concentrations (47Nguyen T. Brunson D. Crespi C.L. Penman B.W. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3030-3034Google Scholar). In order not to be misunderstood, at present harmful effects ofN-nitrosotryptophan derivatives cannot be ruled out. It should be remembered that harmful reactions are also known forS-nitrosothiols. For example, it has been reported thatS-nitrosothiols react with thiols to yield nitroxyl (48Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Google Scholar), which generates hydroxyl radicals and/or peroxynitrite in the absence and presence of oxygen, respectively (49Kirsch M. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13379-13388Google Scholar). Because N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives are rather long-lived and yet not 舡indefinitely舠 stable compounds (the hydrolysis of N-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan is expected to yield the harmless products tryptophan and nitrite (28Meyer T. Williams D. Bonnett R. Ooi S. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1982; 2: 1383-1387Google Scholar)), one may speculate that this could further decrease the putative mutagenic potential of N-nitrosotryptophan. On the other hand, the observed half-life (t12 > 2 h) is so long that N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives (NindoleNO) may participate in physiological processes,e.g. in the transport and release of nitric oxide. In fact, Zhang et al. (21Zhang Y.Y. Xu A.-M. Nomen M. Walsh M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Loscalzo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14271-14279Google Scholar) observed that peptide-boundN-nitrosotryptophan induces vasorelaxation of rabbit aortic rings, a function that is typical for freely diffusing nitric oxide (45Myers P.R. Minor R.L. Guerra R. Bates J.N. Harrison D.G. Nature. 1990; 345: 161-163Google Scholar). In conclusion, we hypothesize that a putative physiological potential of N-nitrosotryptophan should be more important than its pathophysiological one. This feature remains to be clarified in the near future. In any case, we have identified, in addition to cysteine, a second major target for N2O3 in proteins. This fact will strongly influence the general understanding of protein nitrosation. We thank Dr. H.-G. Korth for a series of clarifying discussions pertaining to the nature of the underlying chemistry and for useful comments on this manuscript. We also thank H. Bandmann for advice on the NMR technique. The present investigation would have been impossible without the technical assistance of E. Heimeshoff, M. Holzhauser, and A. Wensing."

In the present study, we report that protection from Fas-induced apoptosis by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) is dependent on both ERK and NFκB activation. First, we showed that two specific mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase-inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126, both counteracted TPA-mediated suppression of Fas-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the dose-dependence of U0126-mediated inhibition of ERK phosphorylation correlated with that of reversion of the anti-apoptotic effect of TPA. Second, we observed an excellent correlation between repression of TPA-induced NFκB activation by an irreversible inhibitor of IκBα phosphorylation, BAY11–7082, and its ability to abrogate TPA-induced suppression of Fas-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, we located the anti-apoptotic effect of both ERK and NFκB to lie upstream of the mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization event. Finally, although each inhibitor at optimal, non-toxic concentration by itself only partly reversed TPA-mediated repression of apoptosis, the combination of U0126 and BAY11–7082 completely abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of TPA.

Dysregulation of apoptosis is implicated in a range of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Google Scholar). Apoptosis-inducing signals can be divided into two main groups: (i) those that lead to the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex at the cytoplasmic side of death receptors, resulting in the direct activation of a cascade of caspases responsible for cell death, and (ii) those that initially lead to the release of apoptogenic molecules from the mitochondria (2Zimmermann K.C. Bonzon C. Green D.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 92: 57-70Google Scholar). In certain cell types, however, even death receptor-initiated apoptotic signals may be dependent on the mitochondria to induce cell death (3Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Google Scholar). Such cell types are termed “type II”-cells, in contrast to “type I”-cells where death receptor-induced cell death is independent of the mitochondria (3Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Google Scholar). One of the best characterized type II-cells is the Jurkat T cell (4Schneider U. Schwenk H.U. Bornkamm G. Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 19: 621-626Google Scholar), where apoptosis induced by ligation of the Fas/CD95 death receptor (5Nagata S. Annu. Rev.

Inhibition of Fas-mediated cell death is critical for T lymphocytes to survive activation, because activation of T cells leads to a markedly increased expression of both the Fas-receptor and its ligand (9McLeod J.D.

We report that the ERK pathway plays a significant, but not exclusive, role in both TPA- and ConA-mediated suppression of Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Furthermore, we identify NFκB as an equally important anti-apoptotic player and show that ERK and NFκB are activated independently of each other. Finally, we demonstrate that simultaneous inhibition of ERK and NFκB fully abrogates the ability of TPA to antagonize Fas-induced cell death. These results suggest that T cells make use of (at least) two independently activated signaling pathways to inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis.DISCUSSIONAlthough much studied, the mechanisms that regulate Fas-induced apoptosis in T cells are incompletely understood. Progress during recent years has implicated several different signal transduction pathways in protection against Fas-induced apoptosis in T cells (13Varadhachary A.S. Peter M.E. Perdow S.N. Krammer P.H. Salgame P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4772-4779Google Scholar, 14Holmstrom T.H. Schmitz I. Soderstrom T.S. Poukkula M. Johnson V.L. Chow S.C. Krammer P.H. Eriksson J.E.

However, in all these studies the anti-apoptotic signaling pathways have only been explored individually. In the present study we showed that in Jurkat T cells the disruption of one signaling pathway alone was never sufficient to fully abolish the strong repression of Fas-induced apoptosis mediated by TPA. We therefore hypothesized that the anti-apoptotic effect of TPA could only be explained by the involvement of at least two distinct and cooperative signaling pathways. Indeed, we report here that simultaneous inhibition of ERK and NFκB was both necessary and sufficient to fully prevent TPA-mediated suppression of Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells.Other signaling transduction pathways, including the PI3/Akt and p38/MAPK pathways (13Varadhachary A.S. Peter M.E. Perdow S.N. Krammer P.H. Salgame P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4772-4779Google Scholar, 25Hausler P. Papoff G. Eramo A. Reif K. Cantrell D.A. Ruberti G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 57-69Google Scholar, 26Nemoto S. Xiang J. Huang S. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16415-16420Google Scholar), have been implicated in repression of Fas-induced cell death in T cells. However, from our results, neither of these pathways seems to be involved in either TPA- or ConA-mediated protection from Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. First of all, two widely used inhibitors of PI3K, LY294002 and wortmannin, had no effect on either TPA- or ConA-mediated suppression of Fas-induced apoptosis. Second, in agreement with a recent report (20Herrant M. Luciano F. Loubat A. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4957-4968Google Scholar), TPA failed to activate Akt as determined by phospho-Akt Western blot analysis and an in vitro Akt kinase assay (data not shown). Third, we showed that TPA- and ConA-mediated suppression of Fas-induced apoptosis were unaffected by the p38/MAPK-inhibitor, SB202190. This is also in line with a previous report (15Yeh J.H. Hsu S.C. Han S.H. Lai M.Z. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1795-1802Google Scholar) in which another widely used p38/MAPK-inhibitor, SB203580, did not influence ConA-mediated protection from Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. In addition to the PI3K/Akt and p38/MAPK pathway, the JNK/SAPK pathway has been implicated in protection from Fas-induced apoptosis in some cell types (45Diao J. Khine A.A. Sarangi F. Hsu E. Iorio C. Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J. Richardson C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8328-8340Google Scholar, 46Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Google Scholar). However, in agreement with a recent study (20Herrant M. Luciano F. Loubat A. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4957-4968Google Scholar), we found that JNK activity was unaffected by TPA in Jurkat cells (data not shown). Thus, neither the PI3K/Akt pathway nor the stress-activated MAP kinases, p38/MAPK and JNK, seem to play any significant role in TPA-mediated suppression of Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells.It was not clear to us why there have been conflicting reports regarding the involvement of the MEK/ERK pathway in TPA-mediated protection from Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells (15Yeh J.H. Hsu S.C. Han S.H. Lai M.Z. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1795-1802Google Scholar, 16Bertolotto C. Maulon L. Filippa N. Baier G. Auberger P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37246-37250Google Scholar, 21Holmstrom T.H. Chow S.C. Elo I. Coffey E.T. Orrenius S. Sistonen L. Eriksson J.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2626-2636Google Scholar, 22Meng X.W. Heldebrant M.P. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3776-3783Google Scholar,27Ruiz-Ruiz C. Robledo G. Font J. Izquierdo M. Lopez-Rivas A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4737-4746Google Scholar). One possible reason could be that previous studies have been based on the use of only PD98059 as a MEK inhibitor. We, and others (31Ahn N.G. Nahreini T.S. Tolwinski N.S. Resing K.A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 417-431Google Scholar), have experienced that PD98059 can be difficult to work with because of its very limited solubility in aqueous solution. When PD98059 was not properly solubilized (i.e. crystals were formed in the medium) it had no effect on TPA-mediated suppression of Fas-induced apoptosis (data not shown). We therefore used two structurally unrelated MEK-inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126) to analyze the effect on apoptosis. Moreover, we assessed apoptosis by three different methods, based on morphological (cell size and granularity), biochemical (PARP cleavage), and molecular (DNA fragmentation) criteria, respectively. Because we obtained essentially the same results with both inhibitors on all three apoptotic criteria, we concluded that the MEK/ERK pathway is indeed required for TPA-mediated suppression of Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells.When utilizing small, cell-permeable inhibitors, there is a general problem of potential unspecific effects. However, we strongly believe that the inhibitor-induced effects we observed in the present study were due to specific interference with the activities of the targeted proteins. First, in a recent study, U0126, PD98059, wortmannin, and SB202190 were all found to be among the most specific of commonly used protein kinase inhibitors (47Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Google Scholar). Second, we demonstrated the specificity of the effects of U0126 and BAY11–7082 by the excellent correlations between inhibitor-induced repression of ERK and NFκB activities, respectively, and their abilities to antagonize the anti-apoptotic effect of TPA. Finally, we directly assessed the ability of U0126 to inhibit NFκB activity and, conversely, that of BAY11–7082 to inhibit AP-1 activity. Indeed, we did not find any unspecific inhibitory effects; if any, U0126 and BAY11–7082 rather slightly increased the activities of NFκB and AP-1, respectively, which in fact may be due to an unleashing of the competition of AP-1 and NFκB for a common co-factor, such as p300 (48Maggirwar S.B. Ramirez S. Tong N. Gelbard H.A. Dewhurst S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 527-539Google Scholar).In conclusion, we propose a model where TPA-mediated suppression of Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells is dependent on the activation and cooperative action of both ERK and NFκB (Fig. 7). In this model, the anti-apoptotic effects of ERK and NFκB are suggested to lie upstream of the mitochondrial membrane disruption event. It will be important to identify the downstream targets that are responsible for the anti-apoptotic effects of ERK and NFκB to further understand how Fas-induced apoptosis is regulated in human T cells. Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved and highly controlled form of cell death that plays a crucial role in development, maintenance of homeostasis, and immunological responses in multicellular organisms. Dysregulation of apoptosis is implicated in a range of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Google Scholar). Apoptosis-inducing signals can be divided into two main groups: (i) those that lead to the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex at the cytoplasmic side of death receptors, resulting in the direct activation of a cascade of caspases responsible for cell death, and (ii) those that initially lead to the release of apoptogenic molecules from the mitochondria (2Zimmermann K.C. Bonzon C. Green D.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 92: 57-70Google Scholar). In certain cell types, however, even death receptor-initiated apoptotic signals may be dependent on the mitochondria to induce cell death (3Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F.

However, in all these studies the anti-apoptotic signaling pathways have only been explored individually. In the present study we showed that in Jurkat T cells the disruption of one signaling pathway alone was never sufficient to fully abolish the strong repression of Fas-induced apoptosis mediated by TPA. We therefore hypothesized that the anti-apoptotic effect of TPA could only be explained by the involvement of at least two distinct and cooperative signaling pathways. Indeed, we report here that simultaneous inhibition of ERK and NFκB was both necessary and sufficient to fully prevent TPA-mediated suppression of Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells.Other signaling transduction pathways, including the PI3/Akt and p38/MAPK pathways (13Varadhachary A.S. Peter M.E. Perdow S.N. Krammer P.H. Salgame P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4772-4779Google Scholar, 25Hausler P. Papoff G. Eramo A. Reif K. Cantrell D.A. Ruberti G. Eur. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16415-16420Google Scholar), have been implicated in repression of Fas-induced cell death in T cells. However, from our results, neither of these pathways seems to be involved in either TPA- or ConA-mediated protection from Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. First of all, two widely used inhibitors of PI3K, LY294002 and wortmannin, had no effect on either TPA- or ConA-mediated suppression of Fas-induced apoptosis. Second, in agreement with a recent report (20Herrant M. Luciano F. Loubat A. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4957-4968Google Scholar), TPA failed to activate Akt as determined by phospho-Akt Western blot analysis and an in vitro Akt kinase assay (data not shown). Third, we showed that TPA- and ConA-mediated suppression of Fas-induced apoptosis were unaffected by the p38/MAPK-inhibitor, SB202190. This is also in line with a previous report (15Yeh J.H. Hsu S.C. Han S.H. Lai M.Z. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1795-1802Google Scholar) in which another widely used p38/MAPK-inhibitor, SB203580, did not influence ConA-mediated protection from Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. In addition to the PI3K/Akt and p38/MAPK pathway, the JNK/SAPK pathway has been implicated in protection from Fas-induced apoptosis in some cell types (45Diao J. Khine A.A. Sarangi F. Hsu E. Iorio C. Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J. Richardson C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8328-8340Google Scholar, 46Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Google Scholar). However, in agreement with a recent study (20Herrant M. Luciano F. Loubat A. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4957-4968Google Scholar), we found that JNK activity was unaffected by TPA in Jurkat cells (data not shown). Thus, neither the PI3K/Akt pathway nor the stress-activated MAP kinases, p38/MAPK and JNK, seem to play any significant role in TPA-mediated suppression of Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells.It was not clear to us why there have been conflicting reports regarding the involvement of the MEK/ERK pathway in TPA-mediated protection from Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells (15Yeh J.H. Hsu S.C. Han S.H. Lai M.Z. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1795-1802Google Scholar, 16Bertolotto C. Maulon L. Filippa N. Baier G. Auberger P. J. Biol.

One possible reason could be that previous studies have been based on the use of only PD98059 as a MEK inhibitor. We, and others (31Ahn N.G. Nahreini T.S. Tolwinski N.S. Resing K.A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 417-431Google Scholar), have experienced that PD98059 can be difficult to work with because of its very limited solubility in aqueous solution. When PD98059 was not properly solubilized (i.e. crystals were formed in the medium) it had no effect on TPA-mediated suppression of Fas-induced apoptosis (data not shown). We therefore used two structurally unrelated MEK-inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126) to analyze the effect on apoptosis. Moreover, we assessed apoptosis by three different methods, based on morphological (cell size and granularity), biochemical (PARP cleavage), and molecular (DNA fragmentation) criteria, respectively. Because we obtained essentially the same results with both inhibitors on all three apoptotic criteria, we concluded that the MEK/ERK pathway is indeed required for TPA-mediated suppression of Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells.When utilizing small, cell-permeable inhibitors, there is a general problem of potential unspecific effects. However, we strongly believe that the inhibitor-induced effects we observed in the present study were due to specific interference with the activities of the targeted proteins. First, in a recent study, U0126, PD98059, wortmannin, and SB202190 were all found to be among the most specific of commonly used protein kinase inhibitors (47Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Google Scholar). Second, we demonstrated the specificity of the effects of U0126 and BAY11–7082 by the excellent correlations between inhibitor-induced repression of ERK and NFκB activities, respectively, and their abilities to antagonize the anti-apoptotic effect of TPA. Finally, we directly assessed the ability of U0126 to inhibit NFκB activity and, conversely, that of BAY11–7082 to inhibit AP-1 activity. Indeed, we did not find any unspecific inhibitory effects; if any, U0126 and BAY11–7082 rather slightly increased the activities of NFκB and AP-1, respectively, which in fact may be due to an unleashing of the competition of AP-1 and NFκB for a common co-factor, such as p300 (48Maggirwar S.B. Ramirez S. Tong N. Gelbard H.A. Dewhurst S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 527-539Google Scholar).In conclusion, we propose a model where TPA-mediated suppression of Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells is dependent on the activation and cooperative action of both ERK and NFκB (Fig. 7). In this model, the anti-apoptotic effects of ERK and NFκB are suggested to lie upstream of the mitochondrial membrane disruption event. It will be important to identify the downstream targets that are responsible for the anti-apoptotic effects of ERK and NFκB to further understand how Fas-induced apoptosis is regulated in human T cells. Although much studied, the mechanisms that regulate Fas-induced apoptosis in T cells are incompletely understood.

https://openalex.org/W1995226763,"The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family plays important roles in angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Novel members of the VEGF family encoded in the Orf virus genome, VEGF-E, function as potent angiogenic factors by specifically binding and activating VEGFR-2 (KDR). VEGF-E is about 45% homologous to VEGF-A at amino acid levels, however, the amino acid residues in VEGF-A crucial for the VEGFR-2-binding are not conserved in VEGF-E. To understand the molecular basis of the biological activity of VEGF-E, we have functionally mapped residues important for interaction of VEGF-E with VEGFR-2 by exchanging the domains between VEGF-ENZ-7 and PlGF, which binds only to VEGFR-1 (Flt-1). Exchange on the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions had no suppressive effect on biological activity. However, exchange on either the loop-1 or -3 region of VEGF-ENZ-7 significantly reduced activities. On the other hand, introduction of the loop-1 and -3 of VEGF-ENZ-7 to placenta growth factor rescued the biological activities. The chimera between VEGF-A and VEGF-ENZ-7 gave essentially the same results. These findings strongly suggest that a common rule exists for VEGFR-2 ligands (VEGF-ENZ-7 and VEGF-A) that they build up the binding structure for VEGFR-2 through the appropriate interaction between loop-1 and -3 regions."

Copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS) and extracellular Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD3) have some sequence identity with SOD1, particularly in the regions of metal binding, but play no significant role in mutant SOD1-induced disease. We hypothesized that it would be possible to form CCS- or SOD3-positive aggregates by making these molecules resemble mutant SOD1 via the introduction of point mutations in codons homologous to a disease causing G85R SOD1 mutation. Using an in vitro assay system, we found that expression of wild type human CCS or a modified intracellular wild type SOD3 does not result in significant aggregate formation. In contrast, expression of G168R CCS or G146R SOD3 produced aggregates as evidenced by the presence of high molecular weight protein complexes on Western gels or inclusion bodies on immunofluorescence.

Because overexpression of wild type SOD1 in either culture or transgenic mice does not produce aggregates, the formation of aggregates may be related to structural motifs found in mutant SOD1.

The first (residues 1–85) and third (residues 234–274) domains of CCS have no real sequence or structural homology with SOD1. Domain 2 (residues 86–233) does exhibit a 50% sequence identity with human SOD1, including three of the four histidine residues that bind copper as well as the three histidines and one aspartic acid that bind zinc, all arranged in a pattern similar to SOD1. Wild type CCS is catalytically inert. However, a D200H substitution, which reconstitutes the fourth copper binding site, is capable of restoring dismutase activity to CCS (19Schmidt P.J. Ramos-Gomez M. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36952-36956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Human extracellular SOD (SOD3) encoded by a gene distinct from SOD1 is composed of 240 amino acids and harbors an 18-amino acid-long signal peptide targeting the protein for the extracellular compartment (20Folz R.J. Crapo J.D. Genomics. 1994; 22: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In SOD3 neither the first 60 amino acids after the signal peptide nor the carboxyl-terminal portion (residues 212–240) bears any sequence or structural homology to SOD1. SOD3 does share a 40% sequence identity with SOD1 in the central portion of the molecule (residues 78–212), including all copper and zinc binding sites. Naturally occurring mutations in CCS or SOD3 have not been reported, nor have these proteins been linked to human disease. Because the central domains in both CCS and SOD3 bear strong homology to SOD1, these proteins are ideal for testing whether the aggregate potential of mutant SOD1 can be mimicked in related proteins. In this work, we demonstrate that both CCS and SOD3 will form aggregates if modified to resemble mutant SOD1. By making a single amino acid substitution in CCS or SOD3 at a position homologous to a disease-causing site in SOD1, we can induce prominent CCS and SOD3 aggregates. These results indicate that proteins bearing structural motifs similar to mutant SOD1 are also at risk for aggregate formation. Wild type and G85R cDNAs for human SOD1 were provided by Dr. Don Cleveland (University of California, San Diego). Wild type human CCS cDNA was a gift from Dr. Jonathan Gitlin (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). G168R and D200H CCS cDNAs were created via PCR primer-directed mutagenesis using the following primers: CCS D200H, 5′-GGC CTC CCC GGC CCA GGT CAT CTT CTC CCT CAT GAA-3′; CCS G168R, 5′-CAC CGC GGA GAC CTG CGC AAT G-3′. Wild type cDNA for SOD3 was generated by reverse transcription PCR from human cerebellar mRNA provided by Dr. Lawrence Honig (University of Texas, Dallas, TX). This full-length SOD3 cDNA was used as a template to create an intracellular (IC) version of SOD3 lacking the first 54 bp that encode an 18-amino acid signal peptide. Two variations of IC-SOD3 were made, including a long form with the full-length carboxyl-terminal end and a short form lacking the last 42 bp, which encode a polybasic heparin binding motif. In both long and short IC-SOD3, we made a G146R mutation via PCR primer-directed mutagenesis. The following primers were used in generating the various SOD3 constructs: 5′-CAA GCT TGC CAT GTG GAC GGG CGA GGA CTC G-3′ and 5′-AAG CGG CCG CCA TGT GGA CGG GCG AGG ACT CGG C-3′, forward primers for IC-SOD3; 5′-ATC TAG ATC ACT CTG AGT GCT CCC GCG CCT-3′ and 5′-AAA CTC GAG TCA CTC TGA GTG CTC CCG CGC CTG-3′, reverse primers for the short form of SOD3; 5′-CGT CGC GGA CCG CGA AGT TGC GG-3′, the primer for SOD3 G146R. All final constructs were confirmed by sequencing. For protein expression, all cDNAs were cloned into pBUDCE4 (Invitrogen), a eukaryotic expression vector containing both cytomegalovirus and elongation factor 1α promoters. Two copies of each cDNA were inserted into the vector; one copy was inserted into the cytomegalovirus site, and the second copy was inserted into the elongation factor 1α site. COS1 (ATCC) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin and streptomycin. For Western blot assays, COS1 cells were grown to 80–100% confluency, subcultured at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/35-mm culture well, and transfected with the constructs of pBUDCE4 with cDNA inserts for SOD1, CCS, or SOD3 according to the protocol for FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). COS1 cells were treated 48 h after transfection with 6.5 μm lactacystin (Calbiochem) or with Me2SO as a vehicle control for 20 h. Cells were harvested 68 h after transfection by trypsinization followed by three PBS washes, and pellets were stored at −80 °C. Pellets were thawed in homogenization buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma), 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (P 8340, Sigma) and homogenized. Samples were taken from the homogenates, and the rest was centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 2 min. Pellets were washed once with the buffer, centrifuged again, and sonicated with a Fisher sonic dismembrator at 10% power with short bursts. Homogenates and sonicated pellet fractions were kept at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Extracts were boiled for 5 min in 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and dye. The extracts then were resolved on 4–20% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane according to the manufacturer's instructions (XCell SureLock system, Invitrogen). After transfer, the membranes were blocked for overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.2% I-Block (Applied Biosystems) and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma)). Membranes were incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer for 2–3 h at room temperature, washed four times with blocking buffer, incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, diluted 1:5000 in blocking buffer (Applied Biosystems) for 2 h at room temperature, and washed again. The immunoreactive signals were detected using the CDP-Star chemiluminescent detection system (Applied Biosystems). COS1 cells were seeded at a density of 3.5 × 104 cells/chamber in 4-cell Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International). Cells were treated 48 h after transfection with 6.5 μm lactacystin or with Me2SO as a vehicle control for 20 h. 68 h after transfection, cells were washed three times in PBS, fixed with 100% methanol for 15 min at −20 °C, washed again in PBS, and incubated for 3 to 4 h at room temperature in blocking buffer containing PBS with 5% normal serum from the same species as the secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.), 1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma), 0.1% gelatin (fish skin gelatin, Sigma), and 0.05% sodium azide. Slides were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C, washed with PBS four times, incubated with cyanine-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG labeled with Cy3 or Cy2, or donkey anti-sheep IgG labeled with Cy3 or Cy2, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) in blocking buffer for 3 to 4 h, again washed with PBS four times, and mounted with Gel/Mount (Biomeda Corp.). Slides were viewed with a Nikon fluorescent microscope under a fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, or dual excitation cube. For Western blots, the following primary antibodies were used: sheep anti-human SOD1 (diluted 1:1000,Calbiochem), rabbit anti-CCS (diluted 1:4000, from Dr. Jeffrey Rothstein), rabbit anti-SOD3 (diluted 1:5000, gift from Dr. James Crapo), and mouse anti-α-tubulin (clone B-5-1-2, monoclonal, diluted 1:3000, Sigma). For immunofluorescence, rabbit anti-CCS and anti-SOD3 antibodies were used as primary antibodies as in the Western blots, and both were diluted 1:333. Also used as primary antibodies for immunofluorescence were the following mouse antibodies: anti-vimentin (clone V9, monoclonal, diluted 1:600, Dako), anti-HSP 70 (monoclonal, diluted 1:300, Stressgen), anti-γ-tubulin (clone GTU-88, monoclonal, diluted 1:300, Sigma), and anti-ubiquitin (clone FK2 against mono- and polyubiquitinated proteins, monoclonal, diluted 1:200, Biotrend). The alignment of amino acid sequences for human wild type SOD1, CCS, and SOD3 is shown in Fig. 1. A glycine to arginine change at codon 85 of SOD1 is capable of producing motor neuron disease both in humans and in transgenic mice characterized by prominent SOD1-positive aggregates (10Bruijn L.I. Becher M.W. Lee M.K. Anderson K.L. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Sisodia S.S. Rothstein J.D. Borchelt D.R. Price D.L. Cleveland D.W. Neuron. 1997; 18: 327-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). This glycine residue is conserved in both wild type CCS (codon 168) and wild type SOD3 (codon 146). To test whether CCS and SOD3 can mimic mutant SOD1 and form aggregates, we made glycine to arginine mutations at this conserved codon (G168R in CCS and G146R in SOD3). We also made CCS bearing a D200H mutation either alone or in association with the G168R change. This D200H mutation restores the fourth copper binding site of CCS and establishes catalytic activity for the molecule. Because SOD3 is a secreted protein, we generated wild type and G146R SOD3 without the signal peptide to create an intracellular SOD3. The carboxyl terminus of SOD3 contains a polybasic heparin binding domain that may be cleaved or maintained depending on tissue type (21Bowler R.P. Nicks M. Olsen D.A. Thogersen I.B. Valnickova Z. Hojrup P. Franzusoff A. Enghild J.J. Crapo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16505-16511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For these experiments, we generated intracellular wild type and G146R SOD3 with and without these polybasic residues to give long and short forms of SOD3. To assess potential aggregate formation with CCS, we modified an in vitro method used previously to study SOD1 aggregates (12Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In this assay, COS1 cells transfected with G85R SOD1 but not with wild type SOD1 form high molecular weight SOD1-positive complexes on Western gels. These SOD1 complexes are concentrated in pellet fractions of total cell lysate and can be accentuated by proteasome inhibition (Fig.2). We therefore transfected COS1 cells with human wild type, D200H, G168R, and G168R/D200H CCS. Cells transfected with these four CCS constructs expressed similar levels of CCS protein when examined in Western blots on total cell homogenates using α-tubulin as a control (Fig.3A). CCS antibody clearly recognized the various mutant forms of CCS in addition to wild type CCS. Base-line COS1 cell expression of CCS was extremely low and barely detectable in Western blots. No clear CCS-positive aggregates were observed in these total cell lysates even after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin.Figure 3Cells expressing G168R or G168R/D200H CCS form CCS-positive complexes. COS1 cells were transfected either with human WT (lane a), D200H (lane b), G168R (lane c), or G168R/D200H CCS (lane d) or with vector alone (Con), and the cells were treated with lactacystin (+) or vehicle (−). Transfected, pelletized cells were homogenized, and aliquots were taken for homogenate samples; the rest were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 2 min. High molecular weight complexes were enriched in the pellet fractions, which represented 10–16% of the total protein. A, 35 μg of total cell homogenates from transfected COS1 cells were loaded on Western gels and probed with anti-CCS antibody (hCCS) and then with anti-α-tubulin antibody after stripping. Similar levels of human CCS protein were expressed for the differing CCS constructs.B, 30 μg of pellet fractions of cell extracts were loaded on Western gels and probed with anti-CCS antibody (hCCS) and then with anti-α-tubulin antibody. Five independent experiments were performed with similar results; G168R and G168R/D200H mutations in CCS lead to CCS-positive complexes, whereas WT or D200H mutations do not.C, 30 μg of pellet fractions of lactacystin-treated cell extracts were loaded on Western gels. Blots were probed with anti-human SOD1 antibody. Cells transfected with CCS mutations do not form SOD1-positive complexes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because SOD1-positive complexes are concentrated in the pellet fraction rather than in total cell homogenates, we performed Western blots on the pellet fraction from CCS-transfected cells. Visible CCS-positive high molecular weight protein complexes were observed in the pellet fraction of COS1 cells transfected with G168R or G168R/D200H CCS but not with wild type or D200H CCS. After treatment with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, cells transfected with G168R or G168R/D200H CCS generated even more prominent CCS-positive high molecular weight protein complexes, whereas cells transfected with wild type and D200H CCS did not form these complexes (Fig. 3B). Thus, complex generation is not related to the overexpression of CCS protein but rather to the expression of CCS bearing the G168R mutation. The observation that D200H expression alone did not induce complexes indicates that a single mutation in CCS by itself does not automatically induce complex formation. Because of the known interaction between CCS and SOD1, we next investigated whether cells with CCS-positive complexes also developed SOD1-positive complexes. Western blot analysis did not confirm the presence of SOD1-positive complexes in CCS-transfected cells (Fig.3C). We used immunofluorescence to assay possible inclusion body formation with the various CCS constructs. Expression of G168R and G168R/D200H CCS yielded prominent CCS-positive inclusions (Fig.4A). The quantitation of CCS-positive inclusions in COS1 cells transfected with wild type or mutant CCS is shown in Fig. 4B. In non-lactacystin-treated cultures, few cells transfected with G168R or G168R/D200H CCS formed CCS-positive inclusions. Virtually no inclusions were noted in cells expressing wild type or D200H CCS. After lactacystin treatment, close to 45% of transfected cells expressing either G168R or G168R/D200H CCS formed CCS-positive inclusions. Again, cells transfected with wild type or D200H CCS generally did not form CCS-positive inclusions. The quantitation of SOD1-positive inclusions in COS1 cells transfected with wild type or G85R SOD1 is shown in Fig. 4C. Expression of G85R SOD1 produced SOD1 inclusions, whereas WT SOD1 did not. These results indicate that CCS bearing G168R mutations will form CCS inclusions under conditions similar to those in which disease-causing SOD1 mutations have been found to cause SOD1-positive inclusions. To determine whether CCS inclusions were present in aggresomes, we used antibodies against γ-tubulin and vimentin. γ-Tubulin colocalized with CCS-positive inclusions, indicating that the inclusions were found in the organizing center of the microtubules (Fig.5A). Many CCS-positive inclusions also were found within vimentin-positive cages, thereby confirming localization within aggresomes (Fig. 5B,arrowhead). However, occasional CCS-positive inclusions were located clearly outside of this vimentin-positive cage (Fig.5B, arrow). CCS-positive inclusions in G168R/D220H-transfected cells were smaller after a shorter treatment with lactacystin (7 h), but their localization was similar (data not shown). It is therefore possible that CCS-positive inclusions not localized in aggresomes may be in transit either to or from aggresomes. Further dual localization studies confirmed that CCS-positive inclusions appear to be ubiquitin-positive (Fig. 5C). Protein chaperones such as HSP 70 have been suggested to be important in modulating mutant SOD1 protein folding and have been associated with SOD1-positive inclusions in mutant SOD1 transgenic mice (7Shinder G.A. Lacourse M.C. Minotti S. Durham H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12791-12796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Treatment with lactacystin causes a nonspecific increase in HSP 70 expression with the formation of HSP 70-positive inclusions (data not shown). CCS inclusions were positive for HSP 70 in some cells (Fig. 5, Dand E, marked with ∨) but not in others (Fig. 5,D and E, marked with >), suggesting that CCS inclusions are not always dependent on HSP 70 expression. To assess possible aggregate formation with G146R IC-SOD3 expression, we used the same COS1 cell assay system. COS1 cells were transfected with intracellular wild type and G146R SOD3 (both short and long forms) and then treated with proteasome inhibitors. Western blots confirmed expression of IC-SOD3 within COS1 cells (Fig.6A). However, we were not able to distinguish SOD3 complexes clearly in the pellet fractions on Western blots either in the presence or absence of lactacystin. We then used immunofluorescence to determine whether expression of G146R IC-SOD3 would yield SOD3-positive inclusions. In the absence of lactacystin treatment, less than 4% of cells transfected with wild type intracellular SOD3 (either short or long forms) formed SOD3-positive inclusions (Fig. 6B). In contrast, 14% of G146R SOD3 short- and 10% of G146R SOD3 long-transfected cells exhibited SOD3-positive inclusions without proteasome inhibition. These percentages are considerably larger than those observed for COS1 cells transfected with either G168R CCS or G85R SOD1, suggesting that the intracellular expression of G146R IC-SOD3 may have greater aggregation potential. We treated transfected cells with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin to determine whether the percentage of inclusion-forming cells could be increased. As a control, we found that expression of wild type human native SOD3 (extracellular), even in the presence of lactacystin, did not yield inclusions. After lactacystin treatment, a large percentage of cells transfected with intracellular SOD3, either wild type or G146R, formed complexes. However, the percentage was significantly higher in cells expressing G146R compared with wild type SOD3, indicating that the presence of a G146R mutation contributed to a substantial increase in the aggregation potential of the SOD3 protein. Other changes in the protein, such as the presence or absence of the terminal heparin binding domain, had no appreciable effect on the inclusion formation of G146R SOD3. We also performed colocalization studies of SOD3-positive inclusions. SOD3-positive inclusions appear to colocalize partially with vimentin cages (Fig. 6C) and with γ-tubulin (data not shown). SOD3 inclusions also appear to be ubiquitin-positive (Fig. 6C) but not always HSP 70-positive (data not shown). These results indicate that SOD3-positive and CCS-positive inclusions share overall similar characteristics. Aggregate formation of mutant proteins is characteristic of many adult onset neurodegenerative conditions (22Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M.

Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Nature. 1997; 389: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). This pattern holds true for SOD1-related disease, in which SOD1-positive aggregates are found in both human beings and transgenic mice that harbor a mutantSOD1 gene. Unlike Huntington's disease, where disease-causing polyglutamine repeats represent an aggregate-forming motif found in proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases, the aggregate-forming motifs within SOD1 remain obscure. It is also unclear whether proteins that are related to mutant SOD1 and harbor similar structural motifs form aggregates. In this work, we demonstrate that selective single amino acid mutations in proteins related to SOD1 will induce aggregate formation of these proteins. These results suggest that motifs shared in mutant SOD1, CCS, and SOD3 can lead to aggregate formation. Although the structural properties within SOD1, CCS, and SOD3 that predispose these proteins to form aggregates are unclear, there is evidence to suggest that metal binding may be important. These proteins share similar copper- and zinc-binding residues arranged in nearly identical spatial patterns. Although much attention was focused initially on copper within SOD1 as possibly related to disease pathogenesis, recent work has suggested that copper binding may not be relevant (18Subramaniam J.R. Lyons W.E. Liu J. Bartnikas T.B. Rothstein J. Price D.L. Cleveland D.W. Gitlin J.D. Wong P.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 26Wang J. Xu G. Gonzales V. Coonfield M. Fromholt D. Copleand N.G. Jenkins N.A. Borchelt D.R. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Our findings here provide additional evidence that copper binding may not be critical to aggregate formation in that mutations in the copper-binding Asp-200 residue of CCS do not alter the ability of CCS to form aggregates. There is stronger evidence to support an important role for zinc binding to SOD1 for both disease pathogenesis and aggregation potential. Altering the levels of zinc-binding proteins can significantly affect zinc levels within the central nervous system and can change the disease course in mutant SOD1 transgenic mice (27Puttaparthi K. Gitomer W.L. Krishnan U. Son M. Rajendran B. Elliott J.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8790-8796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although zinc binding sites may be preserved in SOD1 mutations causing disease, studies have shown that zinc binding to mutant SOD1 is abnormal and has consequences for both the enzymatic and structural integrity of the protein (28Estevez A.G.

Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 2001; 25: 1169-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Changes in zinc binding can enhance the tendency of certain proteins, including prion protein and β-amyloid, to form insoluble complexes, and such mechanisms may contribute to the formation of SOD1 aggregates observed in the disease (30Cherney R.A.

Prion protein is especially interesting in that like SOD1, it possesses dismutase activity and binds both copper and zinc (33Brown D.R. Wong B.S. Hafiz F. Clive C. Haswell S.J. Jones I.M. Biochem.

Mutations in prion protein are responsible primarily for several human dementias, but cases of motor neuron involvement with amyotrophy, similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, have been reported (36Worrall B.B. Rowland L.P. Chin S.S.-M. Mastrianni J.A. Arch. Neurol. 2000; 57: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The biologic consequences of mutant SOD1 aggregate formation are unclear. Protein aggregates may be directly harmful to cells. Recent work has found that protein aggregates interfere with proteasome function, thus potentially leading to a cycle of protein processing dysfunction, increased aggregate formation, and consequent further declines in proteasome protein clearing (6Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). However, the formation of protein aggregates also might be helpful for cells and might be used as a potential way to sequester harmful proteins (37Cummings C.J. Reinstein E. Sun Y. Antalffy B. Jiang Y. Ciechanover A. Orr H.T. Beaudet A.L. Zoghbi H.Y. Neuron. 1999; 24: 879-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). It also is possible that aggregates may be of little positive or negative consequence in disease; rather, they are only a marker of cellular pathology (38Klement I.A. Skinner P.J. Kaytor M.D. Yi H.

Whether protein aggregates contribute to mutant SOD1-induced motor neuron disease is unclear, but certainly there exists a good correlation between aggregate formation and the disease state. Based on this fact, we would predict that expression of G168R CCS or G146R intracellular SOD3 in vivo would lead to a motor phenotype similar to that found in expression of G85R SOD1. Such experiments will test the biological significance of aggregate formation in motor neuron disease and are being pursued actively.

The basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZIP) protein TFE3 and Smad3 synergistically activate transcription of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as well as other genes. We investigated interactions among different bHLHZIP and Smad family proteins. TFE3, TFEB, and Max associated with Smad3 and Smad4 in the absence of DNA and at the PE2.1 element of thePAI-1 promoter. These interactions were mediated by the leucine zipper and MH1 regions of the respective proteins. No interactions were observed with the E47 bHLH family protein. Chimeric proteins, in which leucine zippers from bHLHZIP or bZIP proteins were fused to heterologous bHLH domains, associated with Smad proteins both in the absence of DNA and at the PE2.1 element. The kinetics of bHLHZIP and Smad protein binding at the PE2.1 element were examined using surface plasmon resonance analysis. TFE3 exhibited cooperative DNA binding with Smad proteins, whereas no cooperativity was observed between E47 and Smads. Max inhibited transcription activation by Smad3 and TGF-β at the PAI-1 promoter, whereas TFE3 and TFEB stimulated transcription activation.

TFE3 exhibited cooperative DNA binding with Smad proteins, whereas no cooperativity was observed between E47 and Smads. Max inhibited transcription activation by Smad3 and TGF-β at the PAI-1 promoter, whereas TFE3 and TFEB stimulated transcription activation. These results suggest that Smad family proteins can interact with several bHLHZIP proteins, resulting in different transcriptional outcomes. transforming growth factor-β basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper basic leucine zipper Smad recognition element glutathione S-transferase plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 Members of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)1 superfamily participate in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (1Derynck R.

The long term responses to TGF-β are mediated at least in part by changes in gene transcription. Signals from the TGF-β receptor are transduced to the nucleus by a family of signal-dependent transcriptional activators called Smads (3Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Google Scholar). In response to ligand stimulation, Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by the TGF-β receptor complex. This phosphorylation causes the formation of activated hetero-oligomeric complexes between receptor-activated Smads and the common mediator Smad4, and results in the translocation of Smads to the nucleus, where they modulate the transcription of many genes (7Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Google Scholar, 8Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Google Scholar, 9Kretzschmar M.

Smad family members Smad3 and Smad4 recognize a tetranucleotide (AGAC) sequence element, and therefore have only limited DNA binding selectivity (11Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S.

This Smad recognition element (SRE) is present in multiple copies in the promoters of many TGF-β responsive genes including the PAI-1 (11Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S.

Smad3 and Smad4 have also been reported to bind GC-rich sequences (21Labbe E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Google Scholar). Moreover, sequences outside the SREs are likely to contribute to the specificity of transcription activation by TGF-β (3Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

Because of the limited sequence specificities of Smads, their transcription regulatory functions are determined in large part through interactions with other transcription factors. Members of many different transcription factor families have been shown to interact with Smads including bZIP family members Fos, Jun (17Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B.

Black B.L. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2950-2966Google Scholar). These interactions target Smads to different regulatory regions, and thereby contribute to the differential effects of TGF-β on gene expression in different cell types (17–34). The bHLHZIP family proteins TFE3 and Myc have both been implicated in TGF-β-dependent regulation of gene expression. TFE3 cooperates with Smad3 and Smad4 to activate transcription of the PAI-1 and SMAD7 genes in response to TGF-β stimulation (24Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Google Scholar, 25Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Google Scholar, 27Stopa M. Anhuf D. Terstegen L. Gatsios P. Gressner A.M. Dooley S. J.

In contrast, Myc inhibits TGF-β activation of the p15INK4b and p21Cip1genes (35Seoane J. Pouponnot C. Staller P. Schader M. Eilers M. Massague J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 400-408Google Scholar, 36Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Moroy T. Bartek J. Massague J. Hanel F. Eilers M. Nat.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5913-5922Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the effects of Myc and TFE3 on TGF-β regulation of gene expression are related, and whether other bHLHZIP family members can interact with Smad family proteins. Several different mechanisms have been implied for the antagonistic effects of Myc and TGF-β on p15INK4b gene expression (29Feng X.H. Liang Y.Y. Liang M. Zhai W. Lin X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 133-143Google Scholar, 35Seoane J. Pouponnot C. Staller P. Schader M. Eilers M. Massague J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 400-408Google Scholar, 36Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Moroy T. Bartek J. Massague J. Hanel F. Eilers M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Google Scholar). Myc and Smads have been suggested to independently regulate the p15INK4b promoter (35Seoane J. Pouponnot C. Staller P. Schader M. Eilers M. Massague J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 400-408Google Scholar, 36Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Moroy T. Bartek J. Massague J. Hanel F. Eilers M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Google Scholar). Myc can also interact directly with Smad2 and Smad3 in vitro and in yeast two-hybrid assays, and the direct interaction has been proposed to mediate Myc repression of p15INK4b promoter activity (29Feng X.H. Liang Y.Y. Liang M. Zhai W. Lin X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 133-143Google Scholar). Different regions of Myc are involved in the direct and the indirect regulation of promoter activity, and appear to be required for the repression of p15INK4b transcription under different experimental conditions (29Feng X.H. Liang Y.Y. Liang M. Zhai W. Lin X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 133-143Google Scholar, 36Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Moroy T. Bartek J. Massague J. Hanel F. Eilers M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that multiple mechanisms mediate the antagonistic effects of Myc and TGF-β in different cell types and the presence of different extracellular stimuli. The synergistic activation of PAI-1 transcription by TFE3 and Smads requires a promoter region (PE2.1) containing multiple SREs and an E-box recognition sequence for bHLHZIP proteins. The spacing between these elements is critical for synergistic transcription activation and the MH1 region of Smad3 can interact with TFE3 in vitro (24Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Google Scholar). The direct interaction between Smads and TFE3 has been proposed to mediate the synergistic activation of PAI-1 andSmad7 transcription by these proteins (24Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Google Scholar, 28Hua X. Miller Z.A. Benchabane H. Wrana J.L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33205-33208Google Scholar). Synergistic transcription activation by Smads and other transcription regulatory proteins can be mediated by several different mechanisms. Interactions with some transcription factors can recruit Smads to promoters without the requirement for specific Smad-DNA binding (30Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Google Scholar,39Qing J. Zhang Y. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38802-38812Google Scholar). At other promoters, DNA binding by both proteins is required for maximal TGF-β responsiveness (21Labbe E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Google Scholar, 24Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Google Scholar, 28Hua X. Miller Z.A. Benchabane H. Wrana J.L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33205-33208Google Scholar, 40Zhou S. Zawel L. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 121-127Google Scholar). Finally, in some cases, no direct interactions between Smads and other transcription regulatory proteins appear to be necessary for synergistic activation. The synergy in some of these cases can be mediated by concerted interactions with co-activators or components of the transcriptional machinery (41Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Google Scholar). The structural organization of complexes formed by Smad family proteins with other transcription factors has not been characterized in detail. The DNA sequence requirements and the effects of protein interactions on ternary complex formation at composite regulatory elements are largely unexplored. The role of cooperative DNA binding in synergistic transcription activation by Smads and other transcription regulatory proteins remains hypothetical in the majority of cases. We investigated Smad interactions with other transcription factors at the PE2.1 element of the PAI-1 promoter in an effort to better understand the mechanisms of transcriptional synergy. We sought to determine whether other bHLHZIP family proteins can interact with Smads, and whether interactions between different bHLHZIP and Smad family proteins resulted in cooperative DNA binding. We also wanted to identify the protein regions that mediated the interactions and the DNA sequences that were required for cooperative DNA binding. Finally, we wished to compare the functional consequences of Smad interactions with different bHLHZIP family proteins. pGex-Smad3 and pGex-Smad4 as well as pCMV-Smad3 and pCMV-Smad4 were provided by Rick Derynck (University of California, San Francisco) (22Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Google Scholar). The sequences encoding Smad3(1–145)MH1, Smad3(221–445)MH2, Smad3(1–220)MH1L, Smad4(1–276)MH1, and Smad4(323–552)MH2 were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pGEX2T vector between BamHI andEcoRI sites. GST-TFE3 and GST-TFEB as well as their derivatives were generated by PCR amplification of the respective coding regions from plasmids pSV2a-TFE3S and pSV2a-TFEB provided by Kathryn Calame (Columbia University) (42Roman C. Matera A.G. Cooper C. Artandi S. Blain S. Ward D.C. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 817-827Google Scholar). Plasmid pCS2-mE47 encoding mouse E47 was provided by David Turner (University of Michigan). 2D. Turner, personal communication. The sequences encoding Max (43Wechsler D.S. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7635-7639Google Scholar) or MaxΔ81–102 (MaxΔZIP) were inserted into pCMV-Flag2 (Sigma) to generate the pCMV-Max and pCMV-MaxΔZIP plasmids. Genes encoding chimeric bHLHZIP proteins were constructed by PCR and inserted in pGEX2T or pDS56 vectors for bacterial expression. bTFE3 contained the basic, helix-loop-helix, leucine zipper domain of TFE3 (residues 219–304). bTFE3219–297 was truncated after the third leucine residue in the zipper. bTFE3ΔZIP contained the basic helix-loop-helix domain of TFE3 (residues 219–281) without the leucine zipper. bTFE3L289P contained a substitution of the leucine 289 in the zipper region by a proline residue. Chimera bE47/ZIP(TFE3) contained the basic region and helix-loop-helix region of E47 (residues 337–392) fused to the leucine zipper of TFE3 (residues 282–304). Chimera bTFE3/ZIP(ATF2) contained the basic region and the helix-loop-helix of TFE3 (residues 219–281) and the leucine zipper and COOH-terminal 96 residues of ATF2 (residues 380–505). Escherichia coli BL21 containing pGex-Smad3, pGex-Smad4, pGex-TFE3, pGex-TFEB, or mutant variants were grown in LB media supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C. The protein expression was induced by addition of 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 5 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100 with protease inhibitors and lysozyme, incubated for 30 min on ice, and sonicated. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with 0.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose beads per liter of culture for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline and 2 times with phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% Triton, and the fusion proteins were eluted with 20 mm glutathione. His-tagged proteins encompassing Max, bTFE3, bE47, mutants thereof, or chimeric proteins bE47/ZIP(TFE3) and bTFE3/ZIP(ATF2) were expressed in E. coliand purified in the presence of 6 m guanidine HCl using nickel chelate chromatography as described (44Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Cell. 1991; 66: 317-326Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected using Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Supplemental Fig. 1). All protein preparations contained greater than 90% of the expressed proteins, although some preparations contained a protein with the mobility of GST lacking a fusion. The fraction of active molecules was measured by oligonucleotide titration. All preparations tested had between 70 and 100% active molecules. The identities of the proteins were confirmed by Western blotting using antibodies Smad3(I-20), Smad4(N-16) (Santa Cruz), and TFE3–15451A (Pharmingen). For electrophoretic mobility shift analysis oligonucleotides were radioactively labeled with [γ-32]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed with the complementary strand and the duplexes were purified using 5% PAGE. DNA binding assays were carried out in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the presence of 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC). The complexes were resolved in 5% TBE gels at 250 mV for 2.5–3.5 h. In vitro protein binding assays were carried out to test the ability of bHLHZIP proteins to interact with Smad3 and Smad4. Briefly, 50-μl beads per sample were washed three times with binding buffer (20 HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.7). GST fusion proteins (5 μg) were incubated with beads in a 200-μl volume for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times, and resuspended in 200 μl of binding buffer. Different bHLHZIP proteins and mutants (500 ng of the wild type and equimolar concentrations of the mutants) were added to the beads and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were collected by centrifugation (500 × gfor 5 min in a microcentrifuge) and washed three times with binding buffer without bovine serum albumin. Associated proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS-NUPAGE loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and visualized using anti-His tag antibody (Amersham Biosciences). For transient transfections the mammalian expression vectors pCMV-Smad3, pCMV-Max, pCMV-MaxΔZIP, pSV2a-TFE3S, and pSV2a-TFEB were used. HEPG2 or HEP3B cells were transfected with the expression vectors, indicated together with a reporter construct controlled by the PAI-1(−800/+22) promoter (14Song C.Z. Tian X. Gelehrter T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11776-11781Google Scholar). After 24 h, the cells were transferred into medium with 0.5% fetal calf serum for 6 h and TGF-β was added. After 16–20 h, the cells were lysed and β-galactosidase and luciferase activities were measured usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside hydrolysis and luciferase assays (Promega). The mean ± S.D. were determined from at least three transfections for each construct. Oligonucleotides containing the PE2.1 element from the PAI promoter and variants thereof were synthesized using standard phosphoramidite chemistry, and biotin was added on the 5′ end of one strand. Equimolar amounts of complementary strands were annealed in 10 mmTris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and the duplexes were purified by PAGE in an 8% native gel. Binding kinetics was analyzed using a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). 400 Resonance units of PE2.1 oligonucleotide was immobilized on a SM5 sensor chip. A flow cell without DNA was used as a blank reference control. HBS-EP buffer used for Biacore experiments contained 0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% polysorbate 20 (v/v). Buffer passed over the chip at 10 μl/min for 18 h resulted in a baseline drift of less than 5 resonance units/h, indicating that the immobilized DNA was stable over the course of the experiment. To examine the kinetics of Smad and TFE3 binding, proteins were injected using the KINJECT procedure for 600 s at 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 160, 256, and 512 nm concentrations in HBS-EP buffer at a flow rate 10 or 30 μl/min. No effect of the flow rate on the binding kinetics was observed. Any change in surface plasmon resonance signal of the sample cell compared with the reference cell was interpreted to reflect protein binding. Dissociation of the complex was monitored by passing HBS-EP buffer over the chip for 600 s. The sensor chip was regenerated by a 60-s injection of 0.03% SDS and 3.3 mm EDTA, which restored the original resonance signal of the surface. Duplicate injections (the variation between the replicates was less than 1%) of each ligand concentration were analyzed in random order, with buffer blanks injected periodically for double referencing. To obtain kinetic rate constants, corrected response data were fitted with BiaevalTM 3.1 software. Apparent kinetic constants were calculated by analyzing binding data from the early parts of the association and dissociation phases. The fit was satisfactory to a simple bimolecular model (χ2 < 5). Dissociation kinetics showed no dependence on concentration, whereas the association rate increased with the concentration of the protein. The dissociation rate constants reported here are the averages of k dvalues determined at the different concentrations. The PE2.1 element is the primary target for synergistic activation of the PAI-1promoter by Smad3, Smad4, and TFE3 in response to TGF-β (24Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Google Scholar, 25Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Google Scholar). To investigate the interactions of Smad3 and Smad4 with TFE3 at the PE2.1 element, we examined binding of the purified proteins to oligonucleotides using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig.1 A). Homogeneous, bacterially expressed TFE3 produced two bands. Smad3 also produced two closely migrating bands. These may represent different conformations or oligomeric states of the proteins, or they may result from proteolysis during the DNA binding assay. Co-incubation of TFE3 and Smad3 with DNA produced an additional band with a lower electrophoretic mobility than complexes formed by Smad3 or TFE3 alone (Fig. 1 A,upper panel, lane 3). Similarly, co-incubation of TFE3 and Smad4 with DNA produced an additional band with a lower electrophoretic mobility than complexes formed by Smad4 or TFE3 alone (Fig. 1 A, lower panel, lane 3). These higher order complexes formed more efficiently than would have been the case if TFE3 and Smads bound independently to the oligonucleotide. The amount of higher order complexes formed was generally greater than the sum of the complexes formed by TFE3 and Smads independently. Independent binding by TFE3 and Smads shifted less than 10% of the oligonucleotide in the binding reaction, but TFE3 and Smads together favored binding to the same oligonucleotide rather than independent binding to separate oligonucleotides (Supplemental Fig. 2). Thus, both Smad3 and TFE3 as well as Smad4 and TFE3 facilitated binding by each other at the PE2.1 element in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The PE2.1 element contains three SREs and an E-box (24Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). We compared the DNA sequence requirements for Smad3 and Smad4 binding to this element in the presence and absence of TFE3 by incubating the proteins with mutated variants of the element (Fig.1 A). Smad3 binding and formation of the higher order complex with TFE3 was virtually eliminated by mutation of SRE-3, whereas mutation of SRE-1 or SRE-2 individually or in combination had little effect on Smad3 and TFE3 binding. In contrast, mutation of any one of the SREs (SRE-1, SRE-2, or SRE-3) did not abolish binding or higher order complex formation by Smad4 and TFE3. Simultaneous mutation of any two SREs (SRE-1 and -2, SRE-2 and -3, or SRE-1 and -3) eliminated Smad4 binding and formation of the Smad4-TFE3 complex. Thus, whereas formation of the Smad3-TFE3 complex specifically required SRE-3, formation of the Smad4-TFE3 complex required two SREs, without certain specificity, within this element. The spacing between the SREs and the E-box influences the synergistic activation of PAI-1 and Smad7 transcription by Smad3 and TFE3 in response to TGF-β (24Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Google Scholar, 28Hua X. Miller Z.A. Benchabane H. Wrana J.L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33205-33208Google Scholar). We examined the effect of the spacing between the SREs and the E-box on formation of the Smad3-TFE3 and Smad4-TFE3 ternary complexes at the PE2.1 element (Fig.1 B). Insertion of one or two base pairs between SRE-3 and the E-box reduced Smad3-TFE3 complex formation, and deletion of one base pair virtually eliminated formation of the ternary complex. These results correlate with the loss of TGF-β responsive transcription activation of a reporter gene fused to a PE2.1 element in which the distance between the SREs and the E-box was altered (24Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Google Scholar). In contrast, these mutations had no significant effect on formation of Smad4-TFE3 complexes (data not shown). The mutations also had no detectable effect on DNA binding by Smad3, Smad4, or TFE3 alone. Hence, the spacing between the SREs and the E-box was critical for TFE3 interactions with Smad3 but not for interactions with Smad4. Because the PE2.1 fragment of the PAI-1promoter contains three potential Smad binding sites, we examined if Smad3 and Smad4 could simultaneously participate in a complex with TFE3 at this element. Incubation of TFE3 with a mixture of Smad3 and Smad4 resulted in formation of a complex with a mobility distinct from those of Smad3-TFE3 or Smad4-TFE3 (Fig. 1 C). Anti-Smad4 antibody supershifted both the Smad4-TFE3 complex as well as the complex formed in the presence of Smad3, Smad4, and TFE3 (data not shown). Smad3 and Smad4 favored formation of the quaternary complex with TFE3 over formation of Smad3-TFE3 and Smad4-TFE3 ternary complexes (Supplementary Fig. 4). The quaternary complex was therefore preferred over the two ternary complexes, and the"

The membrane-anchored aspartyl protease औ-siteAPP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) exhibits all of the characteristics of a औ-secretase and has been shown to cleave APP at its औ-site in vitro and in vivo. We found that BACE undergoes cleavage on a surface-exposed α-helix between amino acid residues Leu-228 and Ala-229, generating stable N- and C-terminal fragments that remain covalently associated via a disulfide bond. The efficiency of BACE endoproteolysis was observed to depend heavily on cell and tissue type. In contrast to brain where holoprotein was predominant, BACE was found primarily as endoproteolyzed fragments in pancreas, liver, and muscle. In addition, we observed a marked up-regulation of BACE endoproteolysis in C2 myoblasts upon differentiation into multinucleated myotubes, a well established model system of muscle tissue specification. As in liver, BACE exists as endoproteolyzed fragments in the hepatic cell line, HepG2. We found that HepG2 cells are capable of generating amyloid औ peptide, suggesting that endoproteolyzed BACE retains measurable औ-secretase activity. We also found that BACE endoproteolysis occurs only after export from the endoplasmic reticulum, is enhanced in the trans-Golgi network, and is sensitive to inhibitors of vesicular acidification. The membrane-bound proteases tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme and furin were not found to be responsible for this cleavage nor was BACE observed to mediate its own endoproteolysis by an autocatalytic mechanism. Thus, we characterize a specific processing event that may serve to regulate the enzymatic activity of BACE on a post-translational level.

In this study, we describe a specific endoproteolytic event that may have a significant effect on BACE activity. Whereas the existence of BACE breakdown products has been documented (10Vassar R.

Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar), the protein fragments themselves have not been well characterized, and the process by which they are generated remains unclear. We demonstrate BACE endoproteolysis occurs between amino acid residues Leu-228 and Ala-229, generating stable N- and C-terminal fragments that remain associated in a heterodimeric complex stabilized in part by a disulfide bond. This endoproteolytic process is regulated in a cell type- and tissue type-dependent fashion. We show that BACE endoproteolysis does not appear to take place in neurons. However, the processing event occurs robustly in a variety of native tissues and may play an important role in the differentiation of muscle cells. We also demonstrate that endoproteolyzed BACE appears to retain at least some औ-secretase activity. Finally, we investigate the cell biological determinants and molecular mechanisms underlying the cleavage of BACE. Our results indicate that BACE, like the presenilins, undergoes an endoproteolytic cleavage event with intriguing functional implications.

Human embryonic kidney 293 cells, HepG2, and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum (FBS). C2 cells (39Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 107 FBS. The C2 cells were induced to differentiate by switching to DMEM, 17 FBS, and 1 ॖg/ml insulin (Sigma) for 4 days. All media were additionally supplemented with 17 penicillin/streptomycin. In certain experimental situations, additional chemical reagents were utilized at the following concentrations: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma), 10 ॖm; bafilomycin A1 (Sigma), 1 ॖm; chloroquine (Sigma), 100 ॖm. Cells expressing BACE were preincubated in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM supplemented with 107 dialyzed FBS (starve medium) for 30 min after which they were incubated in the same medium containing 0.5 mCi of [35S]cysteine/methionine per well for a predetermined period. The cells were then washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (17 sodium deoxycholate, 0.17 SDS, 17 Triton X-100, 5 mmEDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl), and quantitatively immunoprecipitated with the desired antibody. For pulse-chase experiments, cells were metabolically labeled as described above for 30 min after which they were quenched with starve medium containing a 100 molar excess of cold methionine/cysteine. The cells were then chased in normal growth medium for times ranging from 1 to 24 h, washed in PBS, lysed in RIPA, and immunoprecipitated with the desired antibody. In some experiments wild-type human APP695 or wild-type human BACE were expressed using recombinant, replication-defective SFV vectors (37Cook D.G. Sung J.C. Golde T.E. Felsenstein K.M. Wojczyk B.S. Tanzi R.E. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Doms R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9223-9228Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In these experiments the cells were incubated with virus using a multiplicity of infection of 2–10 for 1 h in DMEM without serum. Cells were rinsed and incubated in normal growth medium for ∼3–4 h prior to metabolic [35S]methionine labeling as described above. For experiments expressing APP695wt in HepG2 cells, SFV-infected cells were metabolically labeled for 6 h following a 4-h incubation period. Custom DMEM deficient in either methionine or isoleucine was prepared using a minimum Eagle's medium-α Selectamine kit (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 107 dialyzed FBS. 293 cells expressing HA-tagged BACE were preincubated in either the methionine-free or isoleucine-free medium for 30 min followed by an 18-h incubation in the same media supplemented with either [35S]methionine or [3H]isoleucine, respectively. The cells were then washed in PBS, lysed in RIPA, and immunoprecipitated with mAb HA11. Immunoprecipitates were eluted in 1× Laemmli sample buffer plus 0.34 m औ-mercaptoethanol, electrophoresed on 87 polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to ImmobilonTM-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Bands corresponding to BACE-Ct were then cut from the membrane and sequenced by automated Edman degradation collecting each amino acid separately. The amino acids were assayed for radioactivity in a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter. Antibody staining of HeLa cells was performed as described previously (30Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M.-Y. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33729-33737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed and permeabilized in ice-cold methanol followed by incubation in primary antibody diluted in PBS supplemented with 27 FBS and 0.027 saponin. BACE constructs were recognized using rb-HA11, and a monoclonal antibody directed against GM-130 (Transduction Laboratories) was used to detect Golgi. Cells were then incubated in fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in the same solution as the primaries. All micrographs were taken with a Nikon E600 microscope utilizing UV illumination. While characterizing the biochemical properties of BACE under conditions of overexpression in cell culture, we repeatedly noticed the presence of an ∼37-kDa band by SDS-PAGE whose immunoreactivity closely paralleled that of the BACE holoprotein. This species could be readily demonstrated in cell lysates by Western blot using a variety of antibodies directed against the C terminus of BACE (Fig. 1, B andC). Furthermore, peptide competition experiments confirmed that the band was specific and not a background artifact (Fig.1C). We interpreted these findings to suggest that a portion of the BACE holoprotein undergoes endoproteolysis generating a distinct ∼37-kDa C-terminal fragment (BACE-Ct), a mechanism by which the activity of the protein could be regulated (Fig. 1A). We observed significant levels of BACE endoproteolysis in a variety of cell types including human embryonic kidney 293 cells (Fig.1B), baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells (Fig. 1C), Chinese hamster ovary cells, HeLa cells, and N2a cells (data not shown). By using metabolic pulse-chase analysis, we investigated the kinetics of BACE endoproteolysis. 293 cells expressing BACE were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 30 min and chased in non-radioactive media for various times up to 24 h, after which the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation. In these experiments, BACE-Ct first emerged 4 h into the chase after which the fragment accumulated slightly, reaching a maximum at the 12-h time point, before being slowly turned over (Fig.2A). The initial appearance of BACE-Ct several hours after synthesis is characteristic of a physiological breakdown product and is not consistent with BACE-Ct being a post-lysis artifact. In addition, our data indicate that endoproteolyzed BACE is stable and that the cleavage event itself does not simply promote BACE degradation. Pulse-chase experiments were also performed using an antibody directed against the N terminus of BACE (Fig. 2B). These studies demonstrated the accumulation of an ∼37-kDa N-terminal fragment (BACE-Nt) with kinetics parallel to those of BACE-Ct. Thus, BACE endoproteolysis results in the production of stable N- and C-terminal fragments. The exact site of BACE endoproteolysis was determined by N-terminal radiosequencing of BACE-Ct after metabolic labeling with either [35S]methionine or [3H]isoleucine (Fig.3A), which demonstrated that cleavage occurs between amino acid residues Leu-228 and Ala-229. Analysis of the position of these residues in the published BACE crystal structure (40Hong L. Koelsch G. Lin X. Wu S. Terzyan S. Ghosh A. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Science. 2000; 290: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) revealed that both lie in a solvent-exposed α-helix connecting the two extracellular lobes of the protein (Fig.3, B and C). Cleavage at this site would split apart the BACE catalytic domains and could potentially inactivate the enzyme. However, structural studies have indicated the existence of a disulfide bond between residues Cys-216 and Cys-420 (Fig.3C) (29Haniu M. Denis P. Young Y. Mendiaz E.A. Fuller J. Hui J. Bennett B.D.

Wu S. Terzyan S. Ghosh A. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Science. 2000; 290: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Such a connection could serve to maintain the association of BACE-Ct and BACE-Nt even after endoproteolysis. In light of this possibility, we asked whether a distinct BACE C-terminal fragment could be visualized under non-reducing conditions that should preserve the integrity of disulfide bonds. Triton X-100 lysates from 293 cells expressing BACE were analyzed by Western blot after incubation at either 37 or 55 °C in the presence or the absence of औ-mercaptoethanol. Under non-reducing conditions, the BACE holoprotein migrated at a lower apparent molecular weight than under reducing conditions, suggestive of intramolecular disulfide bonding and consistent with previous results (Fig. 3D) (30Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M.-Y. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33729-33737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Whereas BACE-Ct was readily apparent in the presence of औ-mercaptoethanol, it could not be detected in the absence of reducing agent, consistent with the notion that the BACE N- and C-terminal fragments remain covalently associated by a disulfide bond even after endoproteolysis (Fig.3D). To determine whether BACE endoproteolysis takes place at significant levels in vivo, we assayed for the presence of BACE-Ct in a variety of native tissue samples derived from rat. In lysates from pancreas, liver, and muscle, Western blot demonstrated high levels of a C-terminal BACE fragment that co-migrated with BACE-Ct derived from BHK cells (Fig.4A). BACE holoprotein was not readily apparent in these tissues. By contrast, samples from cerebral cortex, cerebellum, diencephalon, and brain stem exhibited negligible amounts of BACE-Ct, whereas the holoprotein was clearly evident (Fig.4A). Analysis of human tissue yielded similar results. Samples from cerebral cortex and cerebellum revealed only BACE holoprotein, whereas lysates from muscle tissue exhibited a large band co-migrating with BACE-Ct. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by peptide blocking (Fig. 4B). To determine whe"

To identify such weak interactions, we have developed a novel double peptide synthesis (DS) method. This method allows us to map protein-protein interactions that involve two linear dis- continuous components from a polypeptide by the use of spatially addressable synergistic pairs of synthetic peptides. The DS procedure is based on the “SPOT” membrane-bound peptide synthesis technique, but to synthesize a mixture of two peptides, it uses both Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl))-alanine and Alloc-alanine at the first cycle. This allows their selective deprotection by either piperidine or tributyltin/palladium treatment, respectively. Using SPOT DS, we confirmed as a proof of principle that Elk-1 Ser383 phosphorylation by ERK-2 kinase is stimulated by the presence of the Elk-1-docking domain. SPOT DS can also be used to dissect protein-protein motifs that define phosphatase substrate affinity. Using this technique, we identified three new regions in the insulin receptor that stimulate the dephosphorylation of the receptor by protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B and presumably increase the selectivity of PTP for this substrate. These data demonstrate that the SPOT DS technique allows the identification of non-linear weakly interacting protein motifs, which are an important determinant of protein kinase and phosphatase substrate specificity and of protein-protein interactions in general.

SPOT double synthesis extracellular signal-regulated kinase N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl N-allyloxycarbonyl phosphate-buffered saline protein-tyrosine phosphatase glutathioneS-transferase mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase Yes-associated protein domain characterized by tryptophanes The substrate specificity of kinases and phosphatases is often determined by multiple domain-domain interactions (1Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar). An example is the Src homology domain of the Src family of kinases and also found in tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and 2, which interacts with phosphotyrosine residues. The study of these domain-domain interactions often involves co-immunoprecipitation or yeast two-hybrid-like approaches. Co-immunoprecipitation often fails to detect weak interactions, whereas two-hybrid-like approaches are time-consuming, usually require nuclear import of the proteins under study, and are prone to interference by host proteins. The SPOT technique, which involves direct on-membrane peptide microsynthesis, is another powerful tool to study protein-protein interactions in the case of linear motifs (2Kramer A. Volkmer-Engert R. Malin R. Reineke U. Schneider- Mergener J. Pept. Res. 1993; 6: 314-319PubMed Google Scholar, 3Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14514-14523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although SPOT allows the testing of a very large number of different peptide motifs for interaction with a given protein, it can only detect relatively strong stable protein-domain interactions, e.g.in epitope mapping (4Frank R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 267: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). To expand this technology so that weak protein-protein interactions can be detected as well, we have modified the SPOT protocol. Instead of synthesizing one peptide per spot, we have set up a procedure that allows the synthesis of two different peptides per spot. This can be used to examine temporary/weak interactions between an enzyme and its substrate. On each spot, one peptide corresponds to a sequence of the substrate that is stably modified by the enzyme, whereas the second peptide reveals a second interaction that occurs between the enzyme and the substrate sequence assayed (see Fig. 2B). This setup is reminiscent of yeast two-hybrid systems where weak protein-protein interactions trigger transcriptional activation but has the advantage that many different peptides (hundreds) can be studied on a single membrane. To validate the SPOT double synthesis (SPOT DS)1 approach, we have focused as proof of principle on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK-2, a mitogen-activated protein kinase. One of the substrates of ERK is Elk-1 Ser383 (5Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Previous work has established that in order for ERK-2 to efficiently phosphorylate its substrate, an interaction with a second linear motif, the docking domain that is present in Elk-1, is necessary (reviewed in Ref.6Enslen H. Davis R.J. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Another binding motif in Elk-1 named FXFP is also involved in the ERK-2·Elk-1 complex formation (7Fantz D.A. Jacobs D. Glossip D. Kornfeld K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27256-27265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although a short peptide from the Elk-1-docking domain is by itself not sufficient to efficiently bind ERK-2 on SPOT, we show here using SPOT DS that the additional presence of the docking domain in the vicinity of the Elk-1 Ser-containing phosphorylation site increases Ser phosphorylation. This result suggests that the SPOT DS is a sensitive approach to detect and define weak synergistic protein-protein interaction motifs. In a second example, we have studied a protein-tyrosine phosphatase for its substrate recognition requirements. PTP-1B is critically involved in insulin receptor dephosphorylation in vivo (8Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). PTP-1B dephosphorylates the insulin receptor kinase at its major autophosphorylation sites Tyr1158, Tyr1162, and Tyr1163 with the greatest efficiency for the latter two (9Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Apart from the phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction between the insulin receptor and the catalytic domain of PTP-1B, another region of PTP-1B involving PTP-1B Tyr152 and Tyr153 is also able to directly interact with the insulin receptor in a non-phosphorylation-dependent manner (10Dadke S.S. Li H.C. Kusari A.B. Begum N. Kusari J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), although the critical domains in the insulin receptor have not yet been defined. Using dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor-autophosphorylated tyrosines as readout, we identified additional insulin receptor-derived peptides that enhanced PTP-1B activity. These data illustrate the use of SPOT DS for phosphatases as well as for kinase substrate definition studies. The pGEX-4TK3 vector corresponds to pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences) with multicloning sites from the pGEX-4T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). pGEX-4TK3-PTP-1B D181A encodes the GST-human PTP-1B fusion protein from amino acids 1 to 289 with Ala181 instead of an Asp (11Walchli S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9792-9796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). pGEX-4TK3-PTP-1B full-length corresponds to the entire human cDNA (GenBankTMaccession number M31724). pGEX-2TK-YAP WW1 encodes the human cDNA region (nucleotides 758–926; GenBankTM accession number P46937) coding for the YAP WW1 domain (amino acids 162–217) (12Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). GST-ERK-2 and GST-MEK-EE (S218E, S222E) were kindly provided by Montserrat Camps (13Camps M.

Transformed bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium in the presence of ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml). For the induction of GST constructs, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added when cells were in exponential phase. Cells were incubated at 30 °C in a shaker for 2 h. After centrifugation, cell pellets were lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 1% Triton X-100 in the presence of a proteinase inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The GST fusion proteins expressed from pGEX-4TK3 or pGEX-2TK vector were engineered to contain a protein kinase A site at the end of the GST part allowing for radiolabeling using the following conditions. 2–5 μg of the GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. After several washes with PBS, beads were incubated with 50 units of protein kinase from bovine heart (Sigma) in kinase buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 12 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 35 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min on ice. Probes were eluted from the beads in 10 mm free glutathione in 50 mmTris, pH 8. SPOT membranes were made with the SPOT robot ASP222 (Intavis, Cambridge, MA). Peptides were synthesized on derivatized cellulose membranes using the 20 Fmoc amino acids from Novabiochem in the presence of coupling reagentN,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (Sigma) and hydroxybenzotriale (Fluka) in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (Aldrich). For phosphorylated peptides, Fmoc-phosphotyrosine and Fmoc-phosphoserine from Novabiochem (catalog numbers 04-12-1156 and 04-12-1151, respectively) were used. The double synthesis was performed by incorporating during the first cycle, Fmoc-Ala-OH (125 mm) and Alloc-Ala-OH (125 mm), using a peptide-coupling solution (375 mmhydroxybenzotriale and 275 mmN,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone). Alloc-Ala-OH was obtained by desalting the Alloc-Ala-OH/dicyclohexylammonium (DCHA) (catalog number E-3530, Bachem) via basic extraction. Deprotection of Alloc was obtained by treating overnight the membranes (once the first synthesis completed) with 50 mm tributyltin hydride (Bu3SnH, catalog number 90915, Fluka), 2 mm Bis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(II)chloride (PdCl2(PPh3)2, catalog number 41,2740, Aldrich), and 115 mm acetic acid in dichloromethane under argon (15Dangles O. Guibe F. Balavoine G. J. Org. Chem. 1987; 52: 4984-4993Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed sequentially twice with dichloromethane, N,N-dimethylformamide (catalog number 27,054-7, Aldrich), twice with 5% diisopropylethylamine (d-3887, Sigma), three times withN,N-dimethylformamide, and finally, three times with methanol. Membranes were dried, and then second syntheses were performed. Membranes were blocked (at least 2 h) and then probed at 4 °C in Western wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 150 mmNaCl) with 1× SPOT blocking buffer (Sigma). After 2 h of incubation with the radiolabeled probes, membranes were washed several times in Western wash buffer. SPOT membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.5× SPOT blocking buffer. GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione beads were incubated 30 min at 37 °C in kinase buffer II (50 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). GST fusion proteins were eluted (see above) and added to blocked SPOT membranes in kinase buffer II. After 40 min at 37 °C under agitation, blots were extensively rinsed. Anti-phospho-Elk-1 antibody (1:1,000 dilution, New England Biolabs,) specific for Elk1-Ser383 was incubated at room temperature with agitation for 1 h. After washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (sc2030, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added at 1:2,000 dilution for 1 h. The antibody-enzyme conjugate was then visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). SPOT membranes were blocked 2 h in dephosphorylation buffer (Western wash buffer, 1× SPOT blocking buffer, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). GST was cleaved off by thrombin on glutathione beads in PBS. Wild type PTP-1B full-length protein (10 μg) was incubated with the SPOT membranes in dephosphorylation buffer at 37 °C for 6 h. GST-PTP-1B was removed by extensive washing in PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 (16). Dephosphorylation was monitored by ECL (see above for conditions) using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, 1:3,000 dilution, Upstate Biotechnology). The insulin receptor surface accessibility model was produced using published coordinates (17Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The Connolly surface was calculated with a probe radius of 1.4 Å using InsightII® (Accelrys) software. The wild type insulin receptor expression vector contained the 4.4 kilobase pairs of full-length human insulin receptor cDNA cloned into pRc-CMV2.vec2. The exchange of the two lysine codons into two alanines to make Mut1 and Mut3 was made using Stratagene QuikChange kit. The plasmid (100 ng) was PCR-amplified with Pfu polymerase (Promega) using an extension time relative to the size of the plasmid used (0.5 kilobase pairs/min) for 14 cycles. The wild type plasmid was digested withDpnI for 1 h at 37 °C. Ultracompetent cells (XL2-Blue, Stratagene) were transformed and plated on selective medium. For each mutation, a pair of primers was designed that carried the codon changes in the center of the sequence (underlinedsequences): 5′-CGG GAT GGC C TAC CTG AAC GCC GCG GCG TTT GT-3′ and 5′-G ATG CAC AAA CGC CGC GGC GTT CAG GTA GG-3′ for Lys1153-Lys1154 and 5′-AC GGA GGC GCG GCA AAC GGG CGG ATT CTG ACC-3′ and 5′-CCC GTT TGC CGC GCC TCC GTT CAT GTG TGT GTA AG-3′ for Lys1368-Lys1369. All of the constructs were checked by sequencing analysis. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were plated in 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well and transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a ratio of 2.5 μl of reagent for 1 μg of DNA. One-tenth of a reporter plasmid was co-transfected to monitor the efficiency of transfection. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were starved for at least 4 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and incubated with 100 nm bovine insulin (Sigma). After 10 min of stimulation, the insulin was removed by replacement with fresh medium. The receptor dephosphorylation process was stopped after 10 min by a rapid removal of the serum-free medium and the addition of protein sample buffer with phosphatase and kinase inhibitors. Western blot detection was with rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphoinsulin receptor/IGF insulin receptor (Tyr1162-Tyr1163) and a mouse monoclonal antibody against human insulin receptor β-subunit (CT-3), both from BIOSOURCE. To synthesize two different peptide sequences on the same spot, an equimolar mixture of Fmoc-Ala and Alloc-Ala was incorporated at the first cycle on the membrane (Fig. 1A). At the end of this cycle, piperidine was used to specifically remove the Fmoc moiety, leaving the other half of the Ala residues blocked for extension by the Alloc moiety. The first peptide synthesis was performed using standard Fmoc chemistry. At the end of this synthesis, amino groups from the elongated peptide were permanently blocked using acetic acid anhydride. Alloc groups were removed by palladium-catalyzed hydrostannolytic cleavage in the presence of tributyltin hydride (15Dangles O. Guibe F. Balavoine G. J. Org. Chem. 1987; 52: 4984-4993Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Finally, the second peptide was synthesized using standard Fmoc chemistry. We confirmed that the Alloc deprotection had been successful by staining with bromphenol blue, an indicator for the freshly deprotected amino groups (4Frank R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 267: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). To determine whether the entire process had been successful, we synthesized two different peptides together or separately: IYETDYZRKGG (the autophosphorylation site of the human insulin receptor; Z stands for phosphotyrosine) and YPPYPPPPYPS (from the p53-binding protein-2, p53BP-2), which are binding motifs for the PTP-1B D181A substrate-trapping mutant (9Salmeen A.

Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2326-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the YAP WW1 domain (18Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17284-17289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), respectively. As shown in Fig. 1B, GST-PTP-1B D181A specifically recognized spots that contained the insulin receptor peptide and the GST-YAP WW1 domain bound those with p53BP-2. The spots, which corresponded to double synthesis (Fig. 1B,top), were bound by both probes. As a control, we confirmed that radiolabeled GST alone did not bind any of the spots (data not shown). These data indicate that co-synthesis of two different peptide sequences on the same SPOT had been successful. To test whether the SPOT DS approach can reveal weak synergistic binding motifs, we tested a sequence known to be important in protein-protein interactions, the docking domain of Elk-1. ERK-2 interacts via its carboxyl common docking domain with this Elk-1-docking domain, which permits the efficient phosphorylation of Ser383 of Elk located in a different domain (Fig.2A) (5Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). ERK-2, activated or not by MEK, does not stably bind to spots that contain either only the Elk-1-docking domain (KGRKPRDLELP) or the Elk-1 phosphorylation site (FWSTLSPIAPR) (data not shown). Therefore, this finding confirms that the ERK-2/Elk1-phosphorylation site interaction is weak. Fig. 2B illustrates the rationale of the assay. Double syntheses on membranes were performed as follows: the Elk-1 phosphorylation site was first synthesized on three spots followed by either the synthesis of the Elk-1-docking domain peptide, an unrelated sequence, or no second peptide on the same spots. SPOT DS membranes were then incubated in kinase buffer II with GST-MEK-EE (constitutively activated), GST-ERK-2 alone, or both together (at a ratio of 1:5 w/w). The MEK protein was required to activate ERK-2 (See Fig. 2Afor the MEK-Elk-1 cascade). As shown in Fig. 2A(bottom), limited phosphorylation of Ser383 was seen when the Elk-1 phosphorylation site was presented alone or in association with the control negative peptide, but serine phosphorylation was strongly enhanced when associated with the Elk-1-docking domain peptide. As expected, GST alone did not interact with any of these spots (data not shown). We conclude that the increase in serine phosphorylation is because of a local increase of ERK-2 concentration resulting from the presence of the docking domain. This enhanced activity was most prominent when ERK-2 had been activated by MEK-EE, but ERK-2 alone also displayed the same pattern because of slight autoactivation (Fig. 2A, bottom center panel). Under the same conditions, MEK-EE alone did not phosphorylate Elk-1 Ser383 (Fig. 2A, left panel). Taken together, the SPOT DS approach revealed a weakly interacting motif that was not detected by the classic SPOT technique. Because it had been reported that PTP-1B and insulin receptor interact via a phosphorylation-independent mechanism (19Dadke S. Kusari J. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23642-23647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we decided to use the SPOT DS approach to search for binding motif(s) on the insulin receptor for PTP-1B. For this reason, phosphopeptides harboring insulin receptor phosphotyrosine 1163 were synthesized on 100 identical spots during the first round. 11-mer peptides covering the entire cytoplasmic region of the insulin receptor with an overlap of seven amino acids between two consecutive peptides were then synthesized during the second round. As a control, the membrane was first probed with an antibody against phosphotyrosine (4G10) to check for synthesis homogeneity as well as for antigen accessibility by the antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A,left panel, some spot-to-spot variation was apparent. Because no such differences were detected during the synthesis by bromphenol blue staining after each cycle (data not shown), we believe that phosphopeptide accessibility to the antibody may be affected by the presence of the second (variable) peptide. After stripping the antibody, the membrane was incubated with full-length PTP-1B. Dephosphorylation was monitored by enhanced chemiluminescence using the same 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig. 3A, right panel). The signal intensities for the spots were measured and corrected with the signals before PTP-1B dephosphorylation (Fig.3B). The results indicate that dephosphorylation was increased in the presence of three different but clustered sets of peptides: 43–44-45, 54–55, and 97–98-99. The overlap of only seven amino acids between spots produced sufficient resolution to allow the identification of 2–3 adjacent positives for each of these three insulin receptor sequences. Interestingly, these three sequences share a common basic KK/RK motif (Table I). However, a succession of basic amino acids is not sufficient to stimulate PTP-1B activity, because peptides harboring the RKR motif found elsewhere in the insulin receptor tested negative. In addition, the two last sequences share a KKXG(R/K)XL motif. These sequence similarities suggest that only one or two region(s) of PTP-1B is (are) involved in protein-protein interaction with insulin receptor. This basic motif also shares some homology with the docking domain for ERK-2, suggesting a similar way of interaction of phosphatases and kinases with their substrate.Table IInsulin receptor peptides that interact with PTP1BView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Conserved amino acids are highlighted in black.

Underlined amino acids are those shared between the two interacting insulin receptor domains 54–55 and 98–99. If the hypothetical PTP-1B-binding peptides are important for dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor by the PTP, one may predict that these peptides are located on the same face of the receptor. The three-dimensional structure has been elucidated from part of the intracellular domain of the insulin receptor (17Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), and two of the three PTP-1B-interactive sequences that we have identified are included in this structure. In the solvent-accessible surface representation in Fig. 4, the three main autophosphorylated insulin receptor tyrosines are shown in red, whereas six amino acids from two of the PTP-1B-recognized motifs are coloredyellow. Unfortunately, the C-terminal motif was not included in the insulin receptor crystals that were used to resolve the structure; thus, the three-dimensional position of the third motif in the insulin receptor is not known. The second motif (amino acids 164–166 are shown in Fig. 4) is adjacent to the autophosphorylated tyrosines, so it is not surprising that these tyrosines are exposed very close to the surface of tyrosines 1162 and 1163. However, the first PTP-1B-binding motif is located 36 amino acids N-terminal of the autophosphorylation site, and its co-localization with the autophosphorylation site is probably not coincidental. In summary, the three-dimensional structure of the insulin receptor is consistent with these peptides being involved in PTP-1B insulin receptor substrate specificity. If the hypothetical PTP-1B binding peptides are important for efficient dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor stimulated by insulin, one may anticipate that mutating their sequences would reduce dephosphorylation by PTP-1B. We decided to test this prediction by overexpressing mutated insulin receptor in cells, stimulate them with insulin, and examine the phosphorylation status of the receptor following insulin withdrawal. Our assumption was that dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor would depend on PTP-1B as has been demonstrated in PTP-1B knock-out mice (8Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P.

Stricker-Krongrad A. Shulman G.I. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Because the second PTP-1B binding motif is directly C-terminal of the autophosphorylation site, we considered it likely that mutating this sequence would (also) affect insulin receptor autophosphorylation efficiency; therefore, we decided to test insulin receptor mutated for the first and third peptide motifs named Mut1 and Mut3 (see Fig.5A, bottom). In both motifs, the two lysine codons were mutated into alanines. As shown in Fig. 5A, top, insulin receptor Mut3 shows increased levels of phosphorylation as compared with wild type or insulin receptor Mut1 following insulin stimulation of the cells. This finding suggests that at least the C-terminal peptide is required for efficient insulin receptor dephosphorylation in a cellular context. However, interpretation of this experiment is not straightforward. It would be necessary to demonstrate that the insulin receptor kinase activity is not affected by the mutations as may be the case for Mut1. It is also not certain that intracellular dephosphorylation of the overexpressed insulin receptor depends on PTP-1B alone. Further evidence for a direct interaction between PTP-1B and these insulin receptor motifs requires further structural and enzymatic studies and ideally co-crystallization. We have shown that it is technically feasible to adapt the SPOT procedure to synthesize mixtures of peptides. This novel procedure is useful for the identification of domains whose weak interaction is critical in protein-protein interactions that are the basis of enzymatic kinase and phosphatase reactions. In contrast to other procedures, the SPOT technique is restricted to testing peptide motifs rather than large proteins. On the other hand, the SPOT provides a convenient approach to study modified peptides such as phosphorylated, glycosylated, or methylated derivatives. The procedure has been automated and adaptable robots are commercially available so that hundreds of syntheses can be performed in a single run. Hitherto, the fine mapping of protein-protein interactions would require the co-crystallization of the enzyme plus its full-sized substrate or the construction and study of large numbers of mutants. The identification of protein regions that are required for optimal enzymatic recognition may result in the development of highly selective peptidometic inhibitors that do not target the usually conserved catalytic domain of the enzyme.

This disease is caused by blood flukes belonging to the genus Schistosoma (Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma japonicum, orSchistosoma hematobium). In America, onlyS. mansoni is found, which had been introduced from Africa in the colonial time (1Despres L. Imbert-Establet D. Monnerot M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These parasites lack the oxygen-dependent pathways required for the synthesis of sterols and fatty acids, thus being entirely dependent on their hosts for these and other complex lipid supplies. In fact, the intracellular fatty acid-binding protein Sm14 is particularly important for schistosomes in the uptake, transport, and compartmentalization of host-derived fatty acids (2Esteves A. Joseph L. Paulino M. Ehrlich R. Int. J. Parasitol. 1997; 27: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because these proteins play a vital role in their physiology and survival, they can represent an ideal target for vaccine development. Indeed, this parasite antigen is considered a promising vaccine candidate for human schistosomiasis by the World Health Organization (3Bergquist N.R. Colley D.G. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 99-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The S. mansoni Sm14 showed already a protective activity against two parasite worms, Fasciola hepatica and S. mansoni (4Tendler M. Brito C.A. Vilar M.M. Serra-Freire N. Diogo C.M. Almeida M.S. Delbem A.C. Da Silva J.F. Savino W. Garratt R.C. Katz N. Simpson A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Recently, the T helper cell 1-mediated immune response elicited by Sm14 has been associated with the resistance to schistosomiasis in individuals from endemic regions of Brazil (5Brito C.F. Caldas I.R. Coura Filho P. Correa-Oliveira R. Oliveira S.C. Scand. J. Immunol. 2000; 51: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For this reason, the study of the S. mansoni gene structure and polymorphism of Sm14 is of pivotal importance to identify the isoform better suited to devise an efficient vaccine. The data presented in this work indicate that the sequence of the various Sm14 proteins is relatively conserved among the American strains of S. mansoni and provide the first experimental evidence for the existence of a reduced polymorphism, especially with respect to S. japonicumFABPs.1 In particular, the single mutation M20T is the principal example in terms of recurrence. Interestingly, this change induces important structural and functional modifications in the protein that can have direct consequence in the development of a schistosomiasis vaccine based on this FABP. In fact, the more structurally stable Sm14-M20 isoform appears to be the better vaccine candidate. In this work, we used both the male and female adult specimens of Brazilian endemic S. mansoni strains: LE has been provided by the Laboratory of Helminthology (FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and BH by the Laboratory of Parasitology (Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, Brazil). The genomic DNA was isolated from the S. mansoni worms following the standard protocols (6Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The TriZOL reagent (Invitrogen) was used for total RNA isolation from LE and BH schistosome strains. Two micrograms of total RNA were reverse-transcribed by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase enzyme (Invitrogen) using an Oligo(dT)18 primer. The first cDNA strands were used as template in the PCR reaction using the same sense and antisense primers designed for genomic Sm14 coding sequence: forward Sm14 primer, 5′-ACCTCGAGGATATCCATATGTCTAGTTTCTTGG-3′, and reverse Sm14 primer, 5′-TTTCCTTTTGCGGCCGCACGCGTGAATTCGAGGCGTTAGGATAGTCGTT-3′. The restriction sites for XhoI, EcoRV, and NdeI in the forward primer and NotI,MluI, and EcoRI in the reverse primer areunderlined, respectively. In boldface are the sequences derived from the Sm14 open reading frame. In addition, a sample from one cDNA library of S. mansoni BH strain kindly provided by Dr. S. Verjovski-Almeida (Instituto de Quı́mica, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil) was also used as template. A total of three independent PCR amplifications from reverse-transcribed cDNAs were analyzed in this study. PCR products were purified from agarose gels after electrophoretic separation using the In Concert Rapid Gel Extraction system kit (Invitrogen), cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequenced using the T7 and SP6 promoter primers. The nucleotide sequence analysis of Sm14 cDNAs were performed on the ABI PRISM 377 sequencer using the ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit. To create site-directed mutation in the cDNA encoding for Sm14, we used the PCR in vitromutagenesis method (7Krajewski J.L. Dickerson I.M. Potter L.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 725-731PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid residue at position 20, in this case methionine, was changed to alanine (Met-20 → Ala-20) using the forward (F) A20 5′-gctgtcGCgtcaaagctag-3′ and the reverse (R) A20 5′-agctttgacGCgacagcatc-3′ primers (the nucleotide positions that were targets for mutagenesis are in uppercase) in appropriate combination with forward and reverse Sm14 primers. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The cDNA clones of the two native Sm14 isoforms (Sm14-M20 and Sm14-T20) and the mutant variant (Sm14-A20) cDNA clones were isolated from agarose gels after digestion withXhoI and MluI and ligated to the pAE expression vector (8Junqueira de Azevedo I.L.M.

This vector allows the expression of recombinant proteins with a minimal N-terminal His6 tag. The obtained constructs were used to transformEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain (Novagen, Madison, WI). One liter of 2× YT medium (1.5% casein hydrolisate, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl; all w/v) was inoculated with 40 ml of the overnight recombinant bacteria culture from single colonies and grown until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. The expression of the recombinant protein was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and cultivated for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. The inclusion bodies containing the recombinant His6-tagged protein were isolated from bacterial lysates and solubilized with 10 ml of buffer containing 8m urea, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.005m 2-mercaptoethanol. The material was diluted 200 times in the refolding buffer (0.005 m imidazole, 0.5 mNaCl, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.005 m2-mercaptoethanol) and stirred for 16 h at room temperature. After the refolding procedure, the recombinant protein was purified by metal-affinity chromatography in Chelating-Sepharose Fast Flow resin (5-ml resin bed, 1-cm-diameter column, Amersham Biosciences). Subsequently, the column was washed with refolding buffer and then the elution was carried out with a buffer containing 0.5 mNaCl, 0.5 m imidazole, and 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. The eluted protein was dialyzed against PBS. For the CD experiments, the protein was dialyzed against 10 mmsodium-phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The protein purity was monitored by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The concentrations of the soluble recombinant proteins were estimated from absorbance at 280 nm, considering an extinction molar coefficient of ε280 = 12,325 m−1 cm−1 based on the expected amino acid sequence of the recombinant protein. Equilibrium unfolding as a function of temperature was monitored by CD, whereas the equilibrium unfolding as a function of denaturant concentration was studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. CD measurements were carried out on a Jasco J-810 Spectropolarimeter at 20 °C equipped with a Peltier unit for temperature control. Far-UV CD spectra were acquired using a 1-mm path length cell at 0.5-nm intervals over the wavelength range from 190 to 260 nm. Five scans were averaged for each sample and subtracted from the blank average spectra. The protein concentration was kept at 10 μm in 10 mm sodium-phosphate buffer as described above. The temperature range was from 15 to 75 °C. The loss of secondary structure was followed by measuring the molar ellipticity of [θ] at 216 nm. Fluorescence changes were followed with a SLM-AMINCO-Bowman Series II Luminescence Spectrometer (Spectronic Instruments, Garforth, Leeds, United Kingdom) with 1-ml samples in a quartz cuvette. The protein concentration was 2 μm, and after each addition of urea, the sample was equilibrated at 20 °C before measurements were made. The intrinsic fluorescence of the rSm14 proteins, mainly because of the two Trp residues, was recorded setting the excitation wavelength at 285 nm and monitoring the shift in the emission maximum in the range of 330–355 nm. The fatty acid dissociation constant of the three recombinant Sm14 proteins was determined by following the changes in fluorescence by increasing the concentration of the fluorescent fatty acid analogue 11-(dansylamino)undecanoic acid (DAUDA) obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The excitation wavelength used for DAUDA was 345 nm. A stock solution of 10 mm DAUDA in ethanol, kept in the dark at −20 °C, was freshly diluted in PBS to 1 mm or 0.1 mm before use in the fluorescence experiments. The protein concentration was 2 μm in 1 ml of PBS at 20 °C. Fluorescence data were subtracted for the blank values (samples without proteins) and fitted by standard non-linear regression techniques (ORIGIN software version 6.1, Origin Lab Corporation, MA) to a single non-competitive binding model to estimate the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) and maximal fluorescence intensity (Fmax). Competitive experiments were designed to reveal a possible difference in affinity of the three rSm14 proteins for the various natural fatty acids. The myristic, palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids obtained from Sigma were stored and diluted as described above for DAUDA. In these experiments, the binding of 2 μm DAUDA to 2 μm protein was performed in the presence or absence of 2 μm of each fatty acid. The three recombinant proteins, rSm14-M20, rSm14-T20, and rSm14-A20, were evaluated for vaccine efficacy in 4–6-week-old female outbred Swiss mice as described previously (4Tendler M. Brito C.A. Vilar M.M. Serra-Freire N. Diogo C.M. Almeida M.S. Delbem A.C. Da Silva J.F. Savino W. Garratt R.C. Katz N. Simpson A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Parasitol. 1986; 16: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mice received three subcutaneous inoculations with 7-day intervals of recombinant proteins in PBS emulsified in aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant. Control mice were injected with PBS plus adjuvant. The animals were further challenged percutaneously with 100 cercariae (LE strain)/mouse 60 days after the last immunization dose and perfused 45 days later. The overall protection efficiency was calculated by the equation [(C − V)/C] × 100, where C is the average number of worms in control animals and V is the average number of worms in vaccinated animals. Statistical analysis was done with Student's ttest (p < 0.05). The genomic sequence of Sm14 was amplified by PCR using DNA isolated from a pool of adult worms of the Brazilian endemic S. mansoni BH strain. The amplified product is larger than that amplified from RNA, indicating the presence of introns (data not shown). The amplified 1.7 kilobase pair of genomic DNA segment was cloned and sequenced from two independent PCR clones (GenBankTM accession AY055467). The sequence analysis revealed the sites of exon-intron junctions. All of the intron-exon boundaries obey the GT/AG rule (Fig.1A) (10Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3292) Google Scholar). The exon nucleotide sequences were identical to that previously reported for Sm14 cDNA cloned from the Puerto Rican strain of S. mansoni (11Moser D. Tendler M. Griffiths G. Klinkert M.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8447-8454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the other members of the FABP gene family, the gene for Sm14 contains four exons separated by three introns (12Bernlohr D.A. Simpson M.A. Hertzel A.V. Banaszak L.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Recently, the presence and position of the introns in the related FABPgene from S. japonicum were also determined by PCR and corresponded exactly to that observed here for S. mansoni (Fig. 1B) (13Scott J.C. Kennedy M.W. McManus D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1517: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The comparison of helminth and mammalian FABP genes showed that the sizes and positions of FABP exons are conserved among these organisms, whereas the size of the introns is quite variable (TableI) (12Bernlohr D.A. Simpson M.A. Hertzel A.V. Banaszak L.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The size of the FABP introns ofS. japonicum, estimated by migration of PCR products in agarose gels (13Scott J.C. Kennedy M.W. McManus D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1517: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), are larger than S. mansoni introns: ∼1200 versus 674; ∼850 versus 585; and ∼70versus 42 nucleotides for introns 1, 2, and 3 ofS. japonicum and S. mansoni, respectively. The intron 3 of S. mansoni is the smallest of all of the related introns found in the FABP gene family so far. Recently, a deletion variant of the S. japonicum FABP called F25 was characterized by cDNA cloning (13Scott J.C. Kennedy M.W. McManus D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1517: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) where the codons for the first 12 amino acids located in exon 2 were absent (Fig.1B). Taking into account the high identity in nucleotide sequence of the FABP genes of S. mansoni and S. japonicum, we speculated that in S. japonicum, the presence of a second 3′-acceptor site for the intron 1 at the beginning of the exon 2 would explain the generation ofS. japonicum F25 transcript. This same alternative splicing could also be used to generate an orthologous S. mansoni F25 variant (Fig. 1A, arrow). After alternative splicing of intron 1 using this putative splice site, the first 12 amino acids of exon 2 could be excised while all of the remaining codons would remain in-frame, exactly as observed in S. japonicum F25. However, this second splice site for intron 1 lacks the characteristic pyrimidine-rich sequence in the intron-exon junction (10Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3292) Google Scholar), and therefore as previously postulated for S. japonicum F25 (13Scott J.C. Kennedy M.W. McManus D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1517: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we do not expect this event to occur frequently.Table ISizes of the introns and of the amino acids in the exons of several FABPsGeneAmino acid sequence length/exonIntron length1234123bpSm142358351767458542FABP-Sj1-aThe intron sizes of the S. japonicum FABP was estimated by PCR (13).23583516120085070Murine KLBP265834172300300500Rat L-FABP2258311614501220610Human I-FABP2258361612001020440Mouse mP22458341612002001300Mouse CRBPII24603416120018004001-a The intron sizes of the S. japonicum FABP was estimated by PCR (13Scott J.C.

Open table in a new tab When the obtained Sm14 genomic sequence was aligned with the nucleic acid sequences of other members of the FABP gene family, the positioning of each of the three introns was found to be conserved. As shown in Fig. 2, the first intron always divides a codon after its first nucleotide in contrast to the other exon/intron borders, which are located after the entire codon (14Matarese V. Stone R.L. Waggoner D.W. Bernlohr D.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1989; 28: 245-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, it is noteworthy that despite this highly conserved gene organization, FABPs do present a few exceptions. In the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria, the orthologous gene does not contain intron 2 (15Wu Q. Andolfatto P. Haunerland N.H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and several putative lipid-binding protein genes from the free-living nematode Caernorhabditis elegans do not have the intron 1 or possess additional introns (16Plenefisch J. Xiao H. Mei B. Geng J. Komuniecki P.R. Komuniecki R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Several cDNA clones generated by independent reverse-transcribed PCR reactions and cDNA libraries from two Brazilian S. mansoni strains were analyzed. A multiple alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences for the coding regions of all of the obtained Sm14 cDNA clones (a total of 30 cDNAs, 13 and 17 cDNAs from LE and BH strains, respectively) is shown in Fig. 3. Eight clones showed a sequence identical to the Sm14 protein cloned from Puerto RicanS. mansoni strain (11Moser D. Tendler M. Griffiths G. Klinkert M.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8447-8454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the other 14 clones presented a single mutation M20T change (ATG→ACG). Interestingly, methionine at this position is strongly conserved among the members of FABP protein family. In the rat intestinal and adipocyte FABPs, an important role for this amino acid residue in ligand binding function was demonstrated (17Richieri G.V. Low P.J. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7397-7405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Two clones, Sm14-M20-L114 and Sm14-T20-L114, displayed the synonymous mutation M114L and are considered to represent true polymorphic Sm14 proteins. Two clones as deduced by comparison with the genomic Sm14 sequence (Fig. 1A) showed the deletion of the amino acid sequence corresponding to the entire exon 3 (Sm14-ΔE3 clones), and they were probably generated by alternative splicing. Nevertheless, because the reverse-transcribed PCR analysis showed a single amplification product corresponding to the Sm14 full-length open reading frame, alternative splicing is expected to be a rare misprocessing of the mRNA precursor (results not shown). Five clones displayed silent mutations (CTA → CTG) at the Leu-23 codon, which is located at 3′ end of the first exon of the Sm14 gene (data not shown). The remaining clones had Met-20 plus single changes in positions where the amino acids were less conserved and are represented by only one clone. These clones may have been generated by PCR mutagenesis, and for this reason, they were not further studied in this work. Fig. 4 summarizes the possible splicing forms of Sm14 proteins.Figure 4Schematic representation of the Sm14 genomic organization and of its splicing forms. The asteriskdenotes the possible alternative splicing site that in S. mansoni would be responsible for the expression of a reduced form of Sm14 similar to Sj-F25.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Overall, almost all of the nucleotide sequences derived from theS. mansoni LE strain showed methionine at position 20 (12 Met-20 residues and 1 Thr-20 residue), whereas in the case of the clones obtained from one BH strain (Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, Brazil), seven clones had the threonine at this position. In addition, the cDNA library derived from the another BH strain (obtained from Instituto de Quı́mica, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil) yielded seven clones with threonine and three clones with methionine at position 20. The polymorphism of the orthologous FABP protein was also characterized in Philippine strains of S. japonicum (13Scott J.C. Kennedy M.W. McManus D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1517: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this case, the cDNA clones obtained had different sequences, and none of them was identical to the previously reported FABP cDNA from the Chinese strain of S. japonicum (18Becker M.M. Kalinna B.H. Waine G.J. McManus D.P. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 148: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results indicate that Sm14 proteins in both BH and LE strains are less polymorphic than the orthologous S. japonicum FABPs. The sequence analysis of the obtained clones indicates the existence of two main isoforms ofS. mansoni FABP (Sm14-M20 and Sm14-T20). This polymorphism, besides the PCR clones from BH and LE strains, was also confirmed from isolated λ-cDNA library clones (11Moser D. Tendler M. Griffiths G. Klinkert M.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8447-8454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from Puerto Rican strain. 2C. R. R. Ramos, M. M. Vilar, A. L. T. O. do Nascimento, M. Tendler, I. Raw, and P. L. Ho, unpublished results. To understand the structural and functional features of these isoforms, we proceeded to verify whether this amino acid position was conserved in the FABPs family using the primary sequence alignments reported previously (results not shown) (2Esteves A. Joseph L. Paulino M. Ehrlich R. Int. J. Parasitol. 1997; 27: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Bernlohr D.A. Simpson M.A. Hertzel A.V. Banaszak L.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The methionine at this position is changed for leucine in a few FABP members or for valine in testis lipid-binding proteins of rat and mouse. These changes agree with the rule of “safe” residue substitutions (19Bordo D. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) where Met can be substituted by Leu or Val without perturbing the protein structure and function. These mutations matched the changes observed for position 20 in the FABP protein family. The only exception is the Sm14-T20 isoform. It is worth pointing out that the methionine residue at this position appears to play an important role in modulating the structural and functional properties of these proteins. In fact, the mutagenesis of this residue in two different FABPs (M20A in adipocyte FABP and M18A in intestinal FABP) produced proteins characterized by a decrease of structural stability as well as their affinity for fatty acids (17Richieri G.V. Low P.J. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7397-7405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Based on these evidence and because the nature of the threonine is very different from the methionine in terms of hydrophobicity and chain size, we expect to observe significant differences between the two main isoforms of Sm14. The recombinant His6-tagged Sm14 proteins (rSm14-M20 and rSm14-T20) were expressed and purified using a metal affinity chromatography. An additional mutant form (rSm14-A20) was also constructed to better evaluate the importance of this amino acid residue in the Sm14 protein. Single protein bands with molecular masses of ∼16 kDa were observed for rSm14-M20 and rSm14-T20 when subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis as well as for rSm14-A20 protein (data not shown). Fig.5A, black line, shows that the three rSm14 proteins present a CD spectrum typical of a protein possessing a secondary structure containing mainly β-structural elements in agreement with the prediction based on its primary sequence (4Tendler M. Brito C.A. Vilar M.M. Serra-Freire N. Diogo C.M. Almeida M.S. Delbem A.C. Da Silva J.F. Savino W. Garratt R.C. Katz N. Simpson A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Overall, the CD spectra show some differences in the chiroptical activity of the three proteins, suggesting that indeed a single mutation at position 20 influences their structural features. The stability of the protein was assessed both by CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. Fig. 5B shows the trace of thermal unfolding of the three rSm14 proteins. The sigmoidal shape indicates we are in the presence of a two-state transition. As indicated by the CD spectra obtained after cooling down the protein, the transition is not completely reversible (Fig. 5A,light gray line). The secondary structure recovery was higher for the rSm14-M20 followed by rSm14-T20 and rSm14-A20 (82.6, 64.4, and 56.8%, respectively). The CD spectra at a high temperature (Fig. 5A, dark gray line) were recorded when the ellipticity at 216 nm had reached a plateau, although they indicated that a protein mainly unfolded still presents a negative shoulder at 222 nm, suggesting the presence of some residual helical determinants (Fig. 5A). It is interesting to note that despite the fact that distinct fatty acid-binding proteins have a similar β-barrel structure, they may have different folding and unfolding intermediates (20Dalessio P.M. Ropson I.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 860-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). From the fitting of the CD traces recorded at an increasing temperature (Fig. 5B), the temperature of unfolding of each protein variant has been derived, showing that the rSm14-M20 isoform was more stable (Tm = 55.3 °C) than rSm14-T20 isoform and rSm14-A20 mutant (Tm = 44.6 and 45.8, respectively). The folding stability of the three rSm14 variants has also been investigated by following the change of their fluorescence emission maximum as a function of increasing concentration of urea. The data confirmed that indeed rSm14-M20 has a higher structural stability (results not shown). The fatty acid binding capability of the three rSm14 proteins was examined by using the environment-sensitive fluorescent fatty acid analogue DAUDA that alters its fluorescence emission spectra and intensities on entry into binding proteins (21Kennedy M.W. Brass A. McCruden A.B. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6700-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The blue shift of DAUDA fluorescence maximum from 543 to 538, 530, and 528 nm for rSm14-M20, rSm14-T20, and rSm14-A20, respectively (results not shown), and the concomitant increase of its fluorescence emission (both indicative of the entry of DAUDA into an apolar environment (22Macgregor R.B. Weber G. Nature. 1986; 319: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar)) confirmed the binding of the fluorescent fatty acid to the three rSm14 variants. These shifts are comparable with the results obtained from structurally related FABPs such as the heart FABP, brain FABP, and adipocyte FABP where the fluorescence emission moves to 536, 531, and 530 nm, respectively (23Zimmerman A.W. van Moerkerk H.T. Veerkamp J.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The liver FABP and the intestinal FABP produce a shift to 500 and 496 nm, respectively (23Zimmerman A.W. van Moerkerk H.T. Veerkamp J.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), values closer to what is observed for S. japonicum F10 FABP (24Kennedy M.W. Scott J.C. Lo S. Beauchamp J. McManus D.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). At large, the observed variability in the emission wavelength indicates that in each FABP, there are local contacts with specific residues and this might justify their difference in affinity. Interestingly, the stoichiometry of the binding of DAUDA to the three rSm14 variants shows a molar ratio of 1:1 similar to most of the FABPs (12Bernlohr D.A. Simpson M.A. Hertzel A.V. Banaszak L.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and the rSm14 variants exhibit quite similarKd values (0.63, 0.82, and 0.66 for rSm14-M20, rSm14-T20, and rSm14-A20, respectively) (Fig.6). To highlight the possible differences in the binding affinities of the three Sm14 proteins for other fatty acids, we performed competitive experiments using DAUDA as tracer and some natural fatty acids as competitors. The addition of myristic, palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids indeed revealed a diverse affinity of the three mutants for these substrates represented by the different extents in the stoichiometric reversal of the fluorescence enhancement of DAUDA. Fig. 7 shows a typical competitive curve where linoleic acid is used to displace DAUDA from rSm14-M20. The efficiency of each fatty acid to displace DAUDA from the rSm14 binding pocket is shown in Fig. 8. A value of 100% indicates the complete displacement of DAUDA. The data show that the rSm14-M20 has the higher affinity for all of the natural fatty acids. Overall, the results indicate that the efficiency in the displacement of DAUDA increases with the increase of both the fatty acid length and the number of insaturations (12Bernlohr D.A. Simpson M.A. Hertzel A.V. Banaszak L.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and, as observed for other FABPs, confirm the importance of the nature of the amino acid residue at position 20 in Sm14. It is interesting to observe that in the case of rSm14-A20, the myristic acid is not able to displace DAUDA evidencing differently from the other rSm14 proteins, an absence of affinity of the mutant for this relatively short fatty acid. A possible key to interpret the similarities and differences in affinity exhibited by the three Sm14 proteins with respect to DAUDA and to the various fatty acids can be derived by the analysis of the crystallographic structure of human brain FABP that reveals that only long chain fatty acids are able to interact with Met-20 (25Balendiran G.K. Schnutgen F. Scapin G. Borchers T. Xhong N. Lim K. Godbout R. Spener F. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27045-27054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we can hypothesize that because of its short chain, DAUDA (only 11 carbon atoms) will not be able to interact with any residue that might be present in position 20, thus justifying the equivalent affinity exhibited by the three proteins for the fluorescent fatty acid probe (Fig. 6). On the other hand, the competition experiments (Fig. 8) where longer fatty acids have been used revealed the existence of distinct affinities that very likely are attributed to selective contacts between the fatty acid and the distinct residue at position 20 of the rSm14 proteins. Altogether, these results indicate that the nature of the amino acid at position 20 is very important for structure stability and for the binding features to fatty acids.Figure 7Displacement of DAUDA by linoleic acid in the binding to rSm14-M20.

The same conditions as described for Fig. 6 were used here for each rSm14 protein (2 μm)versus each fatty acid (2 μm) in the presence of DAUDA (2 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The protection efficacy of the three rSm14 proteins against S. mansoni cercariae was evaluated in outbred Swiss mice as described previously (4Tendler M. Brito C.A. Vilar M.M. Serra-Freire N. Diogo C.M. Almeida M.S. Delbem A.C. Da Silva J.F. Savino W. Garratt R.C. Katz N. Simpson A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.9, rSm14-T20 or rSm14-M20 proteins stimulated a significant protective response (44 and 67%, respectively). Animals vaccinated with these proteins showed a reduction in mean worm burden with values close to or higher than the 40% reduction value defined by the WHO as a prerequisite for an antigen to be considered a potential vaccine candidate against human schistosomiasis. The exception is the rSm14-A20 mutant that turned out to be a poor protective antigen, reaching protection values of around 20% of worm burden reduction. Interestingly, however, in the Sm14, the amino acid at position 20 as shown by molecular modeling (results not shown) (2Esteves A. Joseph L. Paulino M. Ehrlich R. Int. J. Parasitol. 1997; 27: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) is buried within the interior of the molecule like in the other FAPBs (2Esteves A. Joseph L. Paulino M. Ehrlich R. Int. J. Parasitol. 1997; 27: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Bernlohr D.A. Simpson M.A. Hertzel A.V. Banaszak L.J. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27045-27054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, therefore, is not expected to be exposed as an epitope. Nonetheless, the data described here demonstrate the importance of this residue in modulating some structural and functional features of Sm14. Thus, the lack of significant protective ability for rSm14-A20 is probably the result of these properties rather than the change of the epitope exposure. The rSm14-A20 was the more unstable and less structured Sm14 protein (data not shown) (Fig. 5). The rSm14-M20 showed the highest secondary structure recovery (82.5%) after heating to 80 °C followed by rSm14-T20 (64.3%) (Fig.5A) and was more resistant to denaturation by urea as followed by intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan (results not shown). These properties correlate well with the level of protective ability observed (Fig. 9). In fact, heating the rSm14-T20 just before the immunization of the animals resulted in a poor protective response similar to that observed for rSm14-A20 mutant, thus suggesting that for immune protection, Sm14 has to possess the correct fold. This is an important observation for the development of a Sm14-based vaccine (3Bergquist N.R. Colley D.G. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 99-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and it implies that a quality control that takes into account the structure integrity of the protein has to be included in the production of rSm14. In conclusion, the data presented here show for the first time the genomic organization of the Sm14 protein and the existence of polymorphism. A preliminary evaluation of the structural and functional features of some of these mutants has revealed that the Sm14-M20 isoform, characterized by a higher structural stability and by a more pronounced affinity for natural fatty acids, appears to be the more suitable antigen for the development of the schistosomiasis vaccine. This observation shall contribute for the Sm14-based vaccine development. In particular, we believe that the enhanced stability of the protein may be a key property because it can provide a better immune response due to the presence of the proper fold. We thank Dr. Sérgio Verjovsky-Almeida for providing us the S. mansoni cDNA library and Dr. Toshie Kawano for the adult worms of the S. mansoni BH strain."

Prior to contraction, intracellular Ca2+levels are low and the thin filament regulatory proteins block strong actin-myosin interactions to inhibit force generation. Upon release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores to initiate contraction, Ca2+ binding to troponin C (TnC) causes conformational changes within the regulatory apparatus: tropomyosin (Tm),1 troponin I (TnI), and troponin T (TnT). Consequently, strong interactions between actin and myosin are permitted and force is generated. This precise interplay between Ca2+ and the thin filament regulatory complex is essential for orchestrating normal beat-to-beat regulation of cardiac performance. The isoform content of the thin filament regulatory complex changes during cardiac development (Fig. 1) and in numerous cardiac disease states. Specifically, α- and β-Tm isoform ratios are altered during embryonic/fetal myocardial development, with the ratio of α-Tm gene to β-Tm gene expression increasing from 5:1 in fetal hearts to 60:1 in adult rodent and human myocardium (4Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Moreover, differential splicing of cardiac TnT gene transcripts results in expression of an embryonic TnT (eTnT/TnT2) isoform in the developing myocardium followed by a transition to a more basic, lower molecular weight adult TnT (aTnT/TnT4) in adult myocardium (5Anderson P.A.

Early in cardiac development the slow skeletal TnI (ssTnI) isoform is expressed. In the neonatal heart, ssTnI is down-regulated and the cardiac TnI (cTnI) gene is expressed. In the adult myocardium only the cTnI isoform is detected. In concert with Tm, TnI, and TnT isoform switching during development, the cardiac contractile apparatus transitions from being highly sensitive to being less sensitive to Ca2+ (11Fabiato A. Fabiato F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1978; 307: 491-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 12Metzger J.M. Lin W.I. Samuelson L.C. J.

Additionally, in the diseased adult myocardium, embryonic TnT and Tm isoforms have been shown to be re-expressed. For example, in pressure overload hypertrophy β-Tm expression is increased, and in failing human myocardium the eTnT isoform is re-expressed (5Anderson P.A. Moore G.E. Nassar R.N. Circ.

Collectively, these studies provide correlative evidence that thin filament regulatory isoform composition influences Ca2+-activated contractile function. The structural complexities of the multimeric thin filament assembly and the overlapping pattern of TnI, Tm and TnT isoform switching in cardiac development have made it difficult to assign specific functional outcomes to each regulatory isoform transition (4Schiaffino S.

The cellular consequences of disease-mediated disregulation in TnT and Tm isoform expression in cardiac myocytes also remain unknown. Cardiac transgenic studies have proved to be extremely valuable in understanding organ and organismal outcomes to modifications in thin filament regulatory isoforms (17Muthuchamy M. Pieples K. Rethinasamy P. Hoit B. Grupp I.L. Boivin G.P. Wolska B. Evans C. Solaro R.J. Wieczorek D.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18James J. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2105-H2118PubMed Google Scholar). One potential consideration in using this approach lies in distinguishing, at the cellular level, the primary effects of transgene expression from possible secondary/compensatory effects, including the cardiac histopathology and maladaptive growth that can arise in transgenic mice (19MacGowan G.A. Du C. Wieczorek D.F. Koretsky A.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2539-H2548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Muthuchamy M. Boivin G.P. Grupp I.L. Wieczorek D.F. J. Mol.

In addition, to date there has been no single study comparing the functional significance of a systematic manipulation of cardiac-expressed Tm, TnT, and TnI thin filament regulatory isoforms in adult cardiac myocytes. We tested the hypothesis that systematic replacement of each embryonic isoform would uniquely modify adult myocyte contractile responses to Ca2+. To this end, recombinant viral vectors were used for acute genetic engineering of the thin filament regulatory complex. This system has been demonstrated to cause stoichiometric replacement of native thin filament regulatory proteins (TnI, TnT, or Tm) (21Michele D.E. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. Nat.

Self-protein (e.g. expression of adult isoforms, cTnI, aTnT, α-Tm) or reporter viral gene transfer have further demonstrated the specificity of this approach in regard to myocyte contractile structure-function (22Michele D.E. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Rust E.M. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Clin.

Using this system, adult cardiac myocytes were systematically transduced with eight different vectors harboring Tm, TnI, or TnT isoform expression cassettes (Fig. 1). We then directly compared Ca 2+-activated isometric force responses of single adult myocytes following specific TnT, TnI, or Tm isoform replacement. Results demonstrate that ssTnI acts in a dominant manner with respect to the functional significance of cardiac thin filament isoforms in modulating regulation: TnI > Tm and TnT. Eight recombinant adenoviral vectors were used in this study: cTnI; cTnIFLAG (C-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged cTnI); ssTnI, using rat cDNAs; α-Tm (α tropomyosin); α-TmFLAG (C-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged α-Tm); β-Tm (β-tropomyosin), from human cDNAs; eTnT (embryonic cardiac troponin T/also termed TnT2); and aTnT (adult cardiac troponin T/also termed TnT4), from rat cDNA (Fig. 1,A and B). The general strategy and protocols for shuttle plasmid and vector construction, virus production, and purification have been described earlier (22Michele D.E. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Rust E.M. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Clin.

In each case, transcription was driven by the CMV promoter/enhancer. The polyadenylation signal derived from SV40. These methods have been previously described in detail (31Westfall M.V. Rust E.M. Albayya F. Metzger J.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1997; 52: 307-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were removed from adult female Sprague-Dawley rats, mounted on a modified Langendorff perfusion apparatus, perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB) (in mm/liter, 118 NaCl, 4.8 KCl, 25 HEPES, 1.25 K2HPO4, 1.25 MgSO4, 11 glucose) containing 1 mmCa2+ for 5 min, and then perfused with KHB lacking added Ca2+. After 5 min, collagenase (0.5 mg/ml) and hyaluronidase (0.2 mg/ml) were added to the Ca2+-free KHB perfusate, and after 15 min of perfusion the Ca2+concentration was gradually increased to 1 mm and perfused for an additional 15 min. The heart was removed to a sterile beaker, and the ventricles were gently minced in enzyme solution (1 mm Ca2+-KHB + 0.5 mg/ml collagenase + 0.2 mg/ml hyaluronidase). Minced tissue was gently swirled in a 37 °C water bath for 4 × 5 min. The final 2 digests were collected, centrifuged at 45 × g for 10 s, and pelleted cells were resuspended in 1 mm Ca2+-KHB + 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin before gradually increasing the solution Ca2+ to 1.75 mm. Cells were then resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 5% fetal bovine serum + penicillin/streptomycin, counted, and plated on 18-mm2 laminin-coated glass coverslips at 2 × 104 myocytes/coverslip for 2 h. For cardiac myocyte gene transfer, medium was gently replaced with 200 μl of adenovirus diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + P/S to the desired titer. The multiplicity of infection ranged from 250–500 plaque forming units (pfu/rod-shaped myocyte) to optimize gene transfer efficiency for each vector tested. One hour later, 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + P/S was added to each coverslip. Medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + P/S 24 h later and every 2–3 days thereafter for up to 7 days post-gene transfer. Glass micropipettes were used to collect cardiac myocytes for subsequent gel analysis. The non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 (TX-100) was used to permeabilize the sarcolemma for comparison to membrane-intact myocytes prior to loading. SDS-PAGE was run at a constant current of 20 mA for 4–5 h, then transblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.45 μm, Millipore) for 2000 volt-hours and fixed in PBS containing 0.25% glutaraldehyde. Western blots were carried out by initially blocking nonspecific binding sites with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h. Blots were then incubated with either an anti-cardiac TnT monoclonal antibody (Chemicon mAb 1695, 1:500), an anti-striated muscle TnT monoclonal antibody (Sigma T-6277, clone JLT-12, 1:200), an anti-Tm monoclonal antibody (Sigma T-2780, clone TM311, 1:1 × 106), or an anti-TnI antibody (Chemicon mAb 1691, 1:500) for 2 h. To further validate isoform expression, anti-TnI antibody M32259 (Fitzgerald Industries International, Inc, Concord, MA) and anti-Tm antibodies CH-1 were used. Primary antibody was detected by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection assay (Amersham Biosciences). Myocytes on coverslips were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and treated with 50 mm ammonium chloride to remove excess aldehydes. Nonspecific binding of antibodies was minimized with blocking solution containing PBS with 20% normal goat serum (NGS) and 0.5% TX-100. Primary anti-TnI antibody (Chemicon mAb 1691) or anti-FLAG antibody were diluted in PBS with 0.5% TX-100, and 2% NGS was added to cells for 1.5 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS + 0.5% TX-100 and blocked in PBS with 20% normal goat serum in 0.5% TX-100. Secondary antibody conjugated to Texas Red, (Molecular Probes, T-862) diluted in PBS with 0.5% TX-100 and 2% NGS was added for 1 h. Coverslips were washed in PBS for 4 × 5 min, mounted, and sealed. Immunofluorescence labeling of myocytes was viewed on a Nikon Diaphot 200 microscope fitted with a Noran confocal laser imaging system and Silicon Graphics Indy work station. A force transducer (Cambridge Technology, Model 403A; sensitivity, 5 μg; 1–99% response time, 1 ms) and moving coil galvanometer (Cambridge Technology 6350 optical scanner) were attached to the chamber via three-way positioners. The temperature of the experimental chamber was controlled (15 °C) using thermoelectric modules (Melcor Inc.) coupled to a recirculating water bath heat sink. The chamber was positioned on an anti-vibration table. Coverslips were washed several times in relaxing solution (see below) 2–6 days post-gene transfer, and single, rod-shaped, cardiac myocytes were then attached to the glass micropipettes (32Metzger J.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1430-1442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Sarcomere length for each cardiac myocyte was set at 2.15 μm by viewing the myocyte using light microscopy and then adjusting the overall length of the preparation by way of three-way translators. Relaxing and activating solutions contained (in mm/liter) 7 EGTA, 1 free Mg2+, 4 MgATP, 14.5 creatine phosphate, 20 imidazole, and added KCl to yield a total ionic strength of 180 mm/liter. Solution pH was adjusted to 7.00 or 6.20 with KOH/HCl. The pCa (i.e. −log Ca2+) of the relaxing solution was set at 9.0, and thepCa of the solution for maximal activation was 4.0. At eachpCa, steady-state isometric tension developed, after which the fiber was rapidly (< 0.5 ms) slackened to obtain the tension baseline. The myocyte was then relaxed, and the difference between developed tension and the tension baseline following the slack step was measured as total tension. To obtain active tension, resting tension measured at pCa 9.0 was subtracted from total tension. The myocyte was transferred to relaxing solution after each activation at a given pCa. Tension-pCa relationships were constructed by expressing tensions (P) at various submaximal Ca2+ concentrations as fractions of the tension at maximal activation, Po (i.e. isometric tension at pCa 4.0), that bracketed the submaximal activations. To derive values for the Hill coefficient (nH) and midpoint from the tension-pCa relationship (termed K orpCa50), data were fit using the Marquardt-Levenberg non-linear least squares fitting algorithm using the Hill equation in the form: P = (Ca2+)nH/(KnH+ (Ca2+)nH), where Pis tension as a fraction of maximum tension (Po), K is the Ca2+ that yields one-half maximum tension, and nH is the Hill coefficient. Analysis of variance was used to examine whether there were significant differences in pCa50(−log Ca2+ at half maximal tension),nH, or maximum tension using Student-Neuman-Keuls multiple comparison test. A probability level ofp < 0.05 indicated significance. Isolated cardiac myocytes, transduced with recombinant virus harboring adult cardiac TnT (aTnT/TnT4) (14Greig A. Hirschberg Y. Anderson P.A. Hainsworth C. Malouf N.N. Oakeley A.E. Kay B.K. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or embryonic cardiac TnT (eTnT, TnT2) (14Greig A. Hirschberg Y. Anderson P.A. Hainsworth C. Malouf N.N. Oakeley A.E. Kay B.K. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), were examined for TnT expression, followed by single myocyte isometric force recordings. On average, eTnT replacement (calculated as eTnT/(eTnT+aTnT) was about 45% (Fig.2A). Expression of eTnT was not detected in myocytes transduced with aTnT (Fig. 2A) or with reporter vectors (not shown). As demonstrated earlier (25Rust E.M. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1459-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), total TnT content was not altered in aTnT- or eTnT-transduced myocytes. In addition, in myocytes membrane-permeabilized just prior to Western analysis the detection of eTnT was unchanged compared with membrane-intact myocytes (Fig. 2, A and B). The finding of unchanged total TnT content, together with similar detection of eTnT in intact and permeabilized myocytes, provides evidence of sarcomeric replacement of TnT isoforms. Following TnT gene transfer, steady-state isometric force production was determined in single cardiac myocytes. Maximum isometric tension and the slope (Hill coefficient) and position (pCa50) of the tension-pCa relationship were not significantly different among the control, aTnT, or eTnT groups (Fig. 2, C and D). Adult cardiac myocytes were transduced with vectors harboring rat ssTnI or cTnI expression cassettes. In agreement with previous work (27Westfall M.V. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22508-22516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Westfall M.V. Albayya F.P. Turner I.I. Metzger J.M. Circ.

Sci. 2001; 16: 278-281PubMed Google Scholar), ssTnI replacement of endogenous cTnI was greater than 90% at day six post-gene transfer (Fig.3, A and B) with no detected alterations in the expression pattern or stoichiometry of other sarcomeric proteins (data not shown). In addition, ssTnI or cTnI expression did not alter total TnI content and is evidence of stoichiometric replacement of TnI in the sarcomere. To further establish the efficiency and localization of newly expressed TnIs in this setting, we expressed an epitope-tagged TnI in the myocytes (cTnIFLAG). Results showed cTnIFLAG was detected in greater than 95% of the cardiac myocytes (Fig. 3C) with expression discretely localized to the cardiac thin filament as shown previously (22Michele D.E. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In our previous work (27Westfall M.V. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22508-22516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Westfall M.V. Albayya F.P. Turner I.I. Metzger J.M. Circ.

Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C324-C332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that replacement of >90% of cTnI by ssTnI causes marked increases in the Ca2+sensitivity of tension development, with an average increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of 0.26 pCa units. Left unknown is whether ssTnI replacement can be titrated to <50%, which is similar to maximum replacement obtained for eTnT (Fig. 2, Aand B), and still cause alterations in Ca2+-activated tension. Based on the efficiency and synchronization of myofilament gene transfer (Fig. 3C) and the normal turnover rate of sarcomeric proteins (34Martin A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 964-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible to construct a functional dose-response relationship for ssTnI by examining single myocytes at specific time points after gene transfer. Accordingly, in myocytes at days 2 and 3 post-gene transfer, ssTnI replacement averaged at the single myocyte level 14.4 and 20.4%, respectively (Fig. 3,A and B). Even at these relatively low levels of replacement there was a significant increase (p < 0.01) in the Ca2+ sensitivity of tension, indicating a dominant effect of ssTnI to modulate myofilament regulation of contraction (Fig. 3D). The magnitude increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of tension was 0.12 and 0.20pCa units at days 2 and 3, respectively (p< 0.01). For controls, we examined calcium-activated tension in untreated myocytes and myocytes after cTnI gene transfer at days 2 and 3 in primary culture. Results showed that control and cTnI myocytes were unchanged and not different from each other (Fig. 3D). This is in agreement with our earlier finding of stable contractile function in adult myocytes in short-term primary culture (26Rust E.M. Westfall M.V. Metzger J.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 181: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In separate experiments, we evaluated the extent of ssTnI replacement by SDS-PAGE/silver staining and through use of a second anti-TnI antibody. In broad agreement with our main findings (Fig. 3, A and B), SDS-PAGE showed 27.5% replacement of cTnI by ssTnI at day 2 and 67% replacement at day 4. Similarly, blots probed with a second TnI antibody (Fitzgerald) showed 29% replacement of cTnI by ssTnI at day 2 after gene transfer (Fig. 3, E and F). Collectively, our findings, using two different TnI antibodies (Chemicon and Fitzgerald) and SDS-PAGE, demonstrate that the extent of TnI replacement is between 14–29% at day 2 and that this extent of TnI replacement achieves nearly the same magnitude shift in Ca2+ sensitivity of tension as we have reported in several previous studies with > 90% replacement (0.26 pCa units, Refs. 27Westfall M.V. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22508-22516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Westfall M.V. Albayya F.P. Turner I.I. Metzger J.M. Circ.

Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C324-C332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tropomyosin isoforms alone or together with different TnT isoforms have been postulated to play a role in determining Ca2+ sensitivity of tension (35Greaser M.L. Moss R.L. Reiser P.J. J. Physiol. 1988; 406: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 36Reiser P.J. Greaser M.L. Moss R.L. J. Physiol. 1992; 449: 573-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 37Schachat F.H.

Res. 1990; 66: 1204-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In general agreement with the 5.5-day half-life for Tm (34Martin A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 964-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), gene transfer of β-Tm to adult cardiac myocytes resulted in 30–40% replacement of β-Tm at day six post-gene transfer (Fig. 4,A and B). These results were obtained by using two different anti-Tm antibodies (Fig. 4). In earlier work, total Tm protein content and the stoichiometry of Tm within the sarcomere were shown to be unchanged after Tm gene transfer (21Michele D.E. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1413-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Michele D.E. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Expression of β-Tm also was not different in intact and permeabilized myocytes (Fig. 4, A and B), an indication that β-Tm incorporated into the myofilaments. In functional studies on permeabilized single cardiac myocytes, neither maximum isometric tension nor the Ca2+ sensitivity of tension (Hill coefficient/pCa50) were affected by α-Tm, α-TmFLAG, or by β-Tm gene transfer (Fig. 4C legend). Thus, at this level of α-Tm replacement by β-Tm, which is similar to the Tm isoform switching observed during normal myocardial development, myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity is not significantly altered. Acidosis is an important contributor to cardiac dysfunction during myocardial ischemia (39Lee J.A. Allen D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Differential thin filament isoform expression in cardiac development, and among slow and fast skeletal fibers, is thought to play an important role in defining the magnitude in acidic pH-mediated contractile dysfunction (30Westfall M.V. Rust E.M. Metzger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 40Solaro R.J. Lee J.A. Kentish J.C. Allen D.G. Circ. Res. 1988; 63: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the relative effects of Tm, TnI, and TnT isoforms on contractile function at pH 6.20, a level of acidification that accrues during acute myocardial ischemia (39Lee J.A. Allen D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In concert with results obtained under physiological conditions, ssTnI replacement, but not Tm or TnT isoform replacement, had a significant effect on the Ca2+ sensitivity of tension under acidic pH conditions (Fig. 5). Our results demonstrate a functional difference among thin filament regulatory protein isoforms for modulation of Ca2+ sensitivity of tension. Stoichiometric replacement of < 30% of native cTnI with ssTnI caused significant alterations in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity of tension development. By contrast, 30–50% isoform replacement with either eTnT or β-Tm had no significant influence on the Ca2+ sensitivity of tension. This comparative analysis provides direct evidence that ssTnI has a dominant modulatory effect on the regulation of contraction in cardiac muscle. In its simplest form, the cardiac thin filament can be considered a linear array of 24 regulatory units. A regulatory unit is defined as seven actin monomers, one Tm dimer, and one heterotrimeric troponin complex consisting of troponin C, troponin T, and TnI (41Moss R.L. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 865-884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence that these discrete regulatory units are coupled functionally. Nearest neighbor and long-range interactions have been demonstrated among thin filament regulatory units (41Moss R.L. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 865-884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Brandt P.W. Roemer D. Schachat F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 43Brandt P.W. Diamond M.S. Rutchik J.S. Schachat F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our finding that 14–29% TnI isoform replacement can cause significant alterations in function supports the concept of long-range regulatory unit interactions. We previously showed that TnI replacement is a stochastic process along the thin filaments, even at early time points after gene transfer (22Michele D.E. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As an example, 14% TnI isoform replacement would represent an average replacement of 3–4 regulatory units with ssTnI of a total of 24 in each thin filament. Stated differently, 1 in 7 regulatory units, on average, is switched from cTnI to ssTnI. With stochastic TnI replacement, a dominant effect of ssTnI is proposed to extend across 3–4 native cTnI regulatory units from both sides of each new ssTnI regulated unit. Similar types of long-range interaction have been inferred by the partial removal of troponin C subunits, where as little as 5% manipulation in troponin C content has been hypothesized to exert an effect on calcium-activated tension (41Moss R.L. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 865-884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Brandt P.W. Roemer D. Schachat F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, the near neighbor effects of TnI could be mediated via tropomyosin. Recent studies on thin filament regulation reveal multiple transition states/binding interactions of tropomyosin on actin under the influence of calcium and myosin binding (44Lehman W. Hatch V. Korman V. Rosol M. Thomas L. Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Van Eyk J.E. Tobacman L.S. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In the present study, there were further increases in Ca2+ sensitivity as TnI isoform replacement rose from day 2 to day 3 after ssTnI gene transfer (Fig. 3). The calcium sensitivity data at physiological and acidic pH at < 30% TnI replacement are in general agreement with previous gene transfer studies in which nearly all cTnI had been replaced by ssTnI (27Westfall M.V.

This suggests apparent saturation of TnI isoform-dependent functional effects even though 70–80% regulatory units remained coupled with native cTnI. Collectively, these results establish a dominant gain-in-function by ssTnI. Because a change in only about 1 in 7 regulatory units is required to bring about functional effects, this may impact on strategies to influence contractile performance in diseased myocardium. Our finding that up to 45% replacement of α-Tm with the β-Tm isoform has no significant effect on Ca2+-activated tension is in apparent contrast to earlier studies on transgenic mice (45Muthuchamy M. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. O'Toole B.A. Kier A.B. Boivin G.P. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cardiac bundles isolated from β-Tm transgenic mice show increased Ca2+ sensitivity when activated under physiological conditions; however, in agreement with our findings, β-Tm had no significant effect on myofilament pH sensitivity (46Palmiter K.A. Kitada Y. Muthuchamy M. Wieczorek D.F. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11611-11614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). One factor to consider in comparing these results is the extent of Tm replacement. In transgenic studies, about 55% or greater Tm replacement was achieved in vivo (17Muthuchamy M. Pieples K. Rethinasamy P. Hoit B. Grupp I.L. Boivin G.P. Wolska B. Evans C. Solaro R.J. Wieczorek D.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 45Muthuchamy M. Grupp I.L. Grupp G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), a value greater than we have obtained by Tm gene transfer. Based on biochemical and transgenic studies (45Muthuchamy M. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. O'Toole B.A. Kier A.B. Boivin G.P. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), it appears that significant αβ heterodimer formation is necessary for Tm isoform-dependent effects on myofilament Ca2+sensitivity. Another issue to consider is that transgenic manipulation of Tm can and does result in organ-level maladaptive growth (19MacGowan G.A. Du C. Wieczorek D.F. Koretsky A.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2539-H2548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Muthuchamy M. Boivin G.P. Grupp I.L. Wieczorek D.F. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1545-1557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and this could impact subsequent assays of myocyte function. Similarly, eTnT replacement of 40–50% did not alter Ca2+-activated tension. Previously, correlations have been reported between developmental/disease-mediated transitions in cardiac TnT isoform expression and myocardial function (35Greaser M.L. Moss R.L. Reiser P.J. J. Physiol. 1988; 406: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 37Schachat F.H. Diamond M.S. Brandt P.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As with Tm isoforms, higher levels of replacement of TnT isoforms may be necessary to detect changes in myofilament function. In this light, it is interesting to note that single missense mutations associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and placed in eTnT can significantly affect calcium sensitivity, even at very low levels (about 8%) of TnT replacement (25Rust E.M. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1459-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similarly, HCM mutant Tms produce alterations in function at replacement levels comparable with the β-Tm replacement achieved in the present study (21Michele D.E. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1413-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). There are 39 amino acid differences between α- and β-Tm, including many in the C terminus thought to be critical for Tm and TnT interactions (47Smillie L. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). In our functional assay, these 39 amino acid differences appear less significant than HCM-associated single missense mutations in Tm. However, regarding the developmental regulation of thin filament isoform expression, it is apparent that TnI has a much more dominant effect than TnT or Tm isoforms on developmental tuning/modulation of myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. We cannot exclude the possibility that if higher levels of TnT or Tm replacement could be achieved in this system this would then cause alterations in the Ca2+ sensitivity of tension. This result, if obtained, would suggest that the threshold for thin filament isoforms to have a modulatory effect on regulation is markedly higher for Tm and TnT than for TnI isoforms. The finding of a dominant effect of ssTnI isoform replacement even at low levels on Ca2+ sensitivity may be useful in designing TnI proteins for addressing cardiac contractile dysfunction in disease. Based on our results, modified TnI appears to be the best candidate for improving myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity of tension under acidotic conditions during acute myocardial ischemia. In failing myocardium, or in cardiomyopathies associated with altered diastolic Ca2+levels, TnI chimeras with specified regulatory functions may be advantageous (27Westfall M.V. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22508-22516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Westfall M.V. Albayya F.P. Turner I.I. Metzger J.M. Circ.

Modified TnIs may also serve as a potential strategy for correcting inherited diseases associated with mutated sarcomeric proteins because these mutations have been associated with changes in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (17Muthuchamy M. Pieples K. Rethinasamy P. Hoit B. Grupp I.L. Boivin G.P. Wolska B. Evans C. Solaro R.J. Wieczorek D.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Michele D.E. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1413-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It may be possible to affect disease progression if these Ca2+sensitivity shifts are prevented by targeted TnI replacement. Alternatively, pharmaceutical-based strategies to manipulate TnI function may be another approach for future investigation. Finally, although re-expression of embryonic isoforms of TnT and Tm may provide useful bio-markers of failing adult myocardium, our findings indicate that these alterations, at least up to 30–50% replacement, do not appear to contribute to altered calcium-activated tension of the diseased heart."

It is a potent stimulator of JAK2, is required for growth hormone (GH)-induced membrane ruffling, and increases mitogenesis stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and insulin-like growth factor I. Its domain structure suggests that SH2-Bॆ may act as an adapter protein to recruit downstream signaling proteins to kinase·SH2-Bॆ complexes. SH2-Bॆ is tyrosyl-phosphorylated in response to GH and interferon-γ, stimulators of JAK2, as well as in response to PDGF and nerve growth factor. To begin to elucidate the role of tyrosyl phosphorylation in the function of SH2-Bॆ, we used phosphopeptide mapping, mutagenesis, and a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody to identify Tyr-439 and Tyr-494 in SH2-Bॆ as targets of JAK2 bothin vitro and in intact cells. SH2-Bॆ lacking Tyr-439 and Tyr-494 inhibits GH-induced membrane ruffling but still activates JAK2. We provide evidence that JAK1, like JAK2, phosphorylates Tyr-439 and Tyr-494 in SH2-Bॆ and that PDGF receptor phosphorylates SH2-Bॆ on Tyr-439. Therefore, phosphorylated Tyr-439 and/or Tyr-494 in SH2-Bॆ may provide a binding site for one or more proteins linking cytokine receptor·JAK2 complexes and/or receptor tyrosine kinases to the actin cytoskeleton.

The ॆ isoform of SH2-B was originally identified as a JAK2-binding protein that is tyrosyl-phosphorylated in response to GH and interferon-γ, stimulators of the tyrosine kinase JAK2 (1Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Google Scholar). SH2-Bॆ binds preferentially via its SH2 domain to the tyrosyl-phosphorylated, active form of JAK2. It increases dramatically the activity of JAK2 and enhances the tyrosyl phosphorylation of downstream targets of JAK2 such as STAT5 (2Rui L. Carter-Su C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7172-7177Google Scholar). Thus, SH2-Bॆ would be predicted to act in a positive feedback manner to increase signals by cytokines that activate JAK2. SH2-Bॆ also binds to and is tyrosyl-phosphorylated by JAK1, suggesting that SH2-Bॆ may also act as an adapter protein in signaling through cytokines that activate JAK1 (3O'Brien K.B. O'Shea J.J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8673-8681Google Scholar). Four splice variants of SH2-B have been identified (1Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell.

Initial studies suggest that they have overlapping signaling properties. One or more isoforms have been shown to be tyrosyl-phosphorylated by activated forms of the receptors for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (6Yousaf N. Deng Y. Kang Y. Riedel H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15962-15970Google Scholar). SH2-Bॆ has been implicated in GH- and PDGF-induced changes in the actin cytoskeleton and/or cell motility (15Herrington J. Diakonova M. Rui L. Gunter D.R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13126-13133Google Scholar, 16Diakonova M. Gunter D.R. Herrington J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10669-10677Google Scholar). SH2-Bॆ and SH2-Bα have both been implicated in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (10Rui L. Herrington J.B. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10590-10594Google Scholar, 11Qian X. Riccio A. Zhang Y. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1017-1029Google Scholar) and SH2-Bα has been shown to increase the NGF-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of TrkA, the receptor tyrosine kinase for NGF (17Qian X. Ginty D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1613-1620Google Scholar). All four isoforms of SH2-B have been shown to increase DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation stimulated by PDGF or insulin-like growth factor-I (6Yousaf N. Deng Y. Kang Y. Riedel H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40940-40948Google Scholar, 8Riedel H. Yousaf N. Zhao Y. Dai H. Deng Y. Wang J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 39-50Google Scholar), although to varying degrees. Lastly, SH2-Bॆ has been shown to increase the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT5B mediated by a constitutively active form of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (14Kong M. Wang C.S. Donoghue D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15962-15970Google Scholar). These findings suggest that SH2-B mediates or regulates signaling pathways leading to cell motility, growth, and/or differentiation induced by multiple growth factors. However, the mechanisms by which SH2-Bॆ mediates its effects on cell signaling are largely unknown. The domain structure of SH2-Bॆ suggests that it may act as an adapter protein to recruit proteins to cytokine receptor·JAK complexes and receptor tyrosine kinases. SH2-Bॆ contains an SH2 domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, three proline rich regions, and nine tyrosines (see Fig. 1) (1Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Google Scholar). We have shown that the second proline-rich region in SH2-Bॆ is required for maximal cell motility induced by GH and for binding to the small GTPase, Rac (16Diakonova M. Gunter D.R. Herrington J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10669-10677Google Scholar). Rac is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases and has been implicated in the formation of lamellipodia and other structures required for cell motility (18Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Google Scholar, 19Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Google Scholar). Phosphorylated tyrosines in SH2-Bॆ are likely to be binding sites for downstream molecules containing SH2 or phosphotyrosine binding domains. To gain further insight into the mechanisms by which SH2-Bॆ elicits its effects, we sought to identify which tyrosines in SH2-Bॆ are phosphorylated and the role tyrosyl phosphorylation plays in the function of SH2-Bॆ. Phosphopeptide mapping determined that Tyr-439 and Tyr-494 in SH2-Bॆ are targets of JAK2 in vitro andin vivo. We also show that, even though SH2-Bॆ lacking these tyrosines still activates JAK2, SH2-Bॆ lacking tyrosines 439 and 494 acts as a dominant negative to inhibit GH-induced membrane ruffling demonstrating a critical role for Tyr-439 and Tyr-494 in the ability of SH2-Bॆ to regulate membrane ruffling. Furthermore, evidence is provided that JAK1 and the receptor tyrosine kinase, PDGFR, also phosphorylate SH2-Bॆ on Tyr-439. Thus, phosphorylation of Tyr-439 (pY439) in response to PDGF as well as cytokines that activate JAK1 and JAK2 may provide a binding site for proteins important in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.

Construction of the vector encoding rat SH2-Bॆ with a myc tag at the N terminus has been described previously (2Rui L. Carter-Su C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7172-7177Google Scholar). The cDNA for murine JAK2 was provided by J. Ihle and B. Witthuhn (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) (20Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B. Quelle F.W. Cleveland J.L. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Proc.

Individual tyrosines in SH2-Bॆ were mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following primers (sense strand) were used to mutate each tyrosine to phenylalanine: Tyr-48 (5′-CGTTTTCGCCTCTTTCTGGCCTCCCACCC-3′), Tyr-55 (5′-CCCACCCACAATTTGCAGAGCCGGGAGC-3′), Tyr-354 (5′-GGTAGAAGGCCCTTCAGAGTTCATCCTGGAGACAACTG-3′), Tyr-439 (5′-GTCGCAGGGAGCTTTTGGAGGCCTCTCAGACC-3′), Tyr-494 (5′-CCCCTCTCTACCCCGTTCCCTCCCCTGGATAC-3′), Tyr-525 (5′-CCCCTCTCAGGCTTCCCTTGGTTCCACGGC-3′), Tyr-564 (5′-GACGTGGTGAATTTGTCCTCACTTTCAACTTCC-3′), Tyr-624 (5′-CCTTGTCAGCTTTGTGCCCTCCCAGCGG-3′), and Tyr-649 (5′-CGACCGATGCTTCCCCGATGCTTCTTCC-3′). The double mutant, SH2-Bॆ(Y439F,Y494F), was created by using SH2-Bॆ(Y439F) as a template and mutating Tyr-494. All nine tyrosines in SH2-Bॆ were mutated (SH2-Bॆ(9YF)) using the above primers with the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). SH2-Bॆ(Y439F,Y494F) was subcloned in-frame into pEGFP (Clontech) using theBamHI/XbaI sites to create GFP-SH2-Bॆ(Y439F,Y494F). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing by the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core. COS-7, 293T, or 3T3-F442A murine fibroblast cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1 mm l-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin per ml, 100 ॖg of streptomycin per ml, 0.25 ॖg of amphotericin per ml (supplemented DMEM), and 97 fetal calf serum (COS-7) or 97 calf serum (293T and 3T3-F442A). COS-7 and 293T cells were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation (23Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). Transfected cells were assayed 24 (293T) or 48 (COS-7) h after transfection. COS-7 cells overexpressing either PDGFR or JAK2 were incubated overnight in serum-free medium containing 17 bovine serum albumin before lysis. For imaging experiments, 3T3-F442A cells were plated on glass coverslips and transfected with 2.5 ॖg of cDNA expression vector using Transfast (Promega) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Approximately 36 h after transfection, cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium containing 17 bovine serum albumin, treated with ligands at 37 °C, and processed for imaging as described below. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblots were performed as described previously (24Rui L. Gunter D.R. Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3168-3177Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 (293T) or 48 (COS-7) h after transfection, cells were rinsed three times with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4. Cells were then solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.17 Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 10 ॖg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cell lysate) was incubated with the indicated antibody on ice for 2 h. The immune complexes were collected on protein A-agarose (14 ॖl, packed volume) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with washing buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 0.17 Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA) and boiled for 5 min in a mixture (80:20) of lysis buffer and SDS-PAGE sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 107 SDS, 107 ॆ-mercaptoethanol, 407 glycerol, 0.017 bromphenol blue). The solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (5–127 gradient) followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibody and visualization with the ECL detection system. In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (24Rui L. Gunter D.R. Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3168-3177Google Scholar). SH2-Bॆ was immunoprecipitated with αSH2-Bॆ and immune complexes were collected using protein A-agarose. Bound proteins were washed twice with lysis buffer (see above) and once with kinase buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.6, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4). Immunoprecipitates were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in 50 ॖl of kinase buffer containing 0.5 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 ॖg/ml aprotinin, and 10 ॖg/ml leupeptin. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with 500 ॖl of lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted by boiling in a mixture (80:20) of lysis buffer and SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE (5–127 gradient), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and visualized by autoradiography or phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad model 505). 293T cells were transfected as described above. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-free DMEM containing 17 bovine serum albumin. Cells were treated with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (ICN) for 4 h followed by pervanadate for 6 or 30 min as indicated. Pervanadate was prepared by mixing 430 ॖl of 100 mmNa3VO4 with 10 ॖl of 307 H2O2 and incubating at room temp for 20 min. The solution was cooled on ice and added to cell medium to yield a final concentration of 100 ॖmNa3VO4, 200 ॖmH2O2. Cells were lysed. SH2-Bॆ was immunoprecipitated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose as described above. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis were performed as described (25Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-148Google Scholar). Briefly, nitrocellulose containing 32P-labeled SH2-Bॆ labeled in vivoor in vitro (see above) were washed twice with deionized H2O, soaked in 500 ॖl of 0.57 polyvinylpyrrolidone in 100 mm acetic acid at 37 °C for 30 min, washed five times with deionized H2O, and digested with 10 ॖg of methylated trypsin for 4 h at 37 °C. Approximately 85–907 of counts were recovered. Next, digested peptides were lyophilized, oxidized with performic acid, and re-lyophilized. Peptides were separated by thin-layer electrophoresis at pH 8.9 (in vitro) or pH 3.5 (in vivo) followed by a second dimension in thin-layer chromatography using phosphochromatography buffer (25Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-148Google Scholar). For phosphoamino acid analysis, 32P-labeled peptides were scraped from the cellulose plates and eluted from the cellulose with pH 1.9 buffer. Eluted peptides or full-length SH2-Bॆ were subjected to acid hydrolysis in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 60 min and resolved by thin layer electrophoresis in buffer at pH 3.5 containing 0.5 mm EDTA. Phosphoamino acid standards were visualized by ninhydrin, and radioactive spots were visualized by autoradiography or using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad model 505). To measure the effect of SH2-Bॆ on membrane ruffling, cells expressing GFP-SH2-Bॆ or GFP-SH2-Bॆ(Y439F,Y494F) were deprived of serum overnight and treated with GH as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were rapidly rinsed three times with PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 47 formaldehyde in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.17 Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and rinsed three times in PBS. Filamentous actin was stained by incubating samples with Texas Red-phalloidin (1:60) for 30 min at room temperature. Coverslips were then rinsed three times with PBS, mounted on slides, and imaged the same day. Transfected cells expressing GFP-tagged forms of SH2-Bॆ were located with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set using a Nikon TE200 microscope. The number of ruffles, assessed as a concentration of F-actin at a plasma membrane protrusion, per transfected cell was determined. Each transfection was repeated three times with similar results. Between 30 and 119 untransfected cells or cells positive for GFP, GFP-SH2-Bॆ, or GFP-SH2-Bॆ(Y439F,Y494F) from the combined three experiments were scored for the presence of ruffles for each experimental condition. Two-dimensional peptide mapping was used to identify which of the one or more tyrosines in SH2-Bॆ are phosphorylated by JAK2. Each of the nine tyrosines in SH2-Bॆ was individually mutated to phenylalanine within the context of full-length, myc-tagged SH2-Bॆ (Fig. 1). Wild type and mutant forms of myc-tagged SH2-Bॆ were co-expressed with JAK2 in 293T cells. SH2-Bॆ was immunoprecipitated with αSH2-Bॆ. The immobilized SH2-Bॆ·JAK2 complex was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in an in vitro kinase assay. Radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized by autoradiography. As reported previously (2Rui L. Carter-Su C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7172-7177Google Scholar, 3O'Brien K.B. O'Shea J.J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8673-8681Google Scholar), JAK2 is constitutively active when overexpressed in 293T cells and co-precipitates with SH2-Bॆ (Fig. 2A). Wild type SH2-Bॆ was phosphorylated in vitro (Fig. 2A,lane 1), presumably by JAK2, because SH2-Bॆ is not phosphorylated when JAK2 is not overexpressed (data not shown). Each of the individual tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants of SH2-Bॆ was also phosphorylated in the kinase assay (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–10), suggesting that SH2-Bॆ is phosphorylated on more than one tyrosine. SH2-Bॆ with tyrosine 439 mutated to phenylalanine (SH2-Bॆ(Y439F)) migrated faster than wild type or other mutant forms of SH2-Bॆ (Fig. 2A, lane 5). This faster migration could be due to the loss of phosphorylation of Tyr-439. The region of the nitrocellulose containing 32P-labeled SH2-Bॆ was excised and digested with trypsin. Tryptic peptides were oxidized in performic acid and then separated first by thin layer electrophoresis and then in the second dimension by ascending chromatography. 32P-Labeled peptides were visualized by autoradiography. Wild type SH2-Bॆ contained two highly phosphorylated peptides (Fig. 2B, panel i, Spots 1and 2) and several more peptides that are phosphorylated less robustly. Darker exposures of the map of wild type SH2-Bॆ revealed at least five more spots (data not shown). The phosphopeptide map generated from SH2-Bॆ overexpressed in COS-7 cells resembles that seen with SH2-Bॆ expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 2B,panel i versus panel ii). Thus, two-dimensional maps of SH2-Bॆ from both 293T and COS-7 cells reveal that JAK2 phosphorylates SH2-Bॆ in vitro on at least two peptides. To determine if peptides 1 and 2 generated from two-dimensional mapping of SH2-Bॆ are phosphorylated on tyrosine(s), serine(s), or threonine(s), we performed phosphoamino acid analysis. Peptides 1 and 2 were isolated from Fig. 2B (panel i). As a comparison, we also performed phosphoamino acid analysis on the tryptic digest of full-length, wild type SH2-Bॆ used for this panel. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that full-length SH2-Bॆ is phosphorylated primarily on tyrosine residues in vitro (Fig.2C, lane 1). SH2-Bॆ was minimally phosphorylated on serines and threonines. The 32P incorporated into Spots 1 (Fig. 2C, lane 2) and 2 (Fig. 2C, lane 3) contained exclusively phosphotyrosine. No 32P co-migrating with phosphoserine or phosphothreonine was detected. We also performed phosphoamino acid analysis on the five lighter spots that are visible in darker exposures (48 h) of maps of SH2-Bॆ (data not shown). Each of these spots contained 32P-labeled phosphoserine and phosphothreonine as well as phosphotyrosine (data not shown). Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of SH2-Bॆ in which individual tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanine (Fig. 2B,panels iii–xi) yielded maps similar to wild type SH2-Bॆ with two exceptions. In the maps of SH2-Bॆ(Y439F), Spot 1completely disappears (Fig. 2B, panel vi) suggesting that in wild type SH2-Bॆ, this spot corresponds to a peptide containing phosphorylated Tyr-439. Spot 2 disappears when Tyr-494 is mutated suggesting that Tyr-494 is phosphorylated by JAK2 in vitro (Fig. 2B, panel vii). Neither the presence nor the migration of any of the lighter spots reproducibly changed when maps of wild type and all mutant forms of SH2-Bॆ were compared, suggesting that these lighter spots are not derived from SH2-Bॆ. Taken together, the data from phosphopeptide mapping of wild type and mutant forms of SH2-Bॆ as well as phosphoamino acid analysis reveal that JAK2 phosphorylates SH2-Bॆ on tyrosines 439 and 494 in vitro. To provide insight into whether Tyr-439 and Tyr-494 are also phosphorylated in vivo, JAK2 was co-expressed with wild type SH2-Bॆ, SH2-Bॆ(Y439F), SH2-Bॆ(Y494F), or the double mutant SH2-Bॆ(Y439F,Y494F) in 293T (Fig.3A) or COS-7 (Fig.3B) cells. SH2-Bॆ was immunoprecipitated and Western blotted with αPY. SH2-Bॆ is not tyrosyl-phosphorylated when expressed alone (see Fig. 9B, lanes 1 and2, below). As reported previously (3O'Brien K.B. O'Shea J.J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8673-8681Google Scholar), SH2-Bॆ is tyrosyl-phosphorylated by JAK2 when they are co-expressed in either 293T or COS-7 cells (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 2). When Tyr-439 is mutated to phenylalanine, the tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bॆ decreased compared with wild type in both cell types tested (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 3 versus lane 2). SH2-Bॆ(Y439F) migrates faster than wild type SH2-Bॆ, consistent with a lower level of phosphorylation. SH2-Bॆ(Y494F) has, at best, only a modest reduction in tyrosyl phosphorylation compared with wild type SH2-Bॆ (Fig. 3,A and B, lane 4 versus lane 2). When both Tyr-439 and Tyr-494 were mutated to phenylalanine within the context of full-length SH2-Bॆ (SH2-Bॆ(Y439F,Y494F)) (Fig. 3, A and B,lane 5), the tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bॆ was similar to or less than in cells expressing wild type SH2-Bॆ or cells expressing SH2-Bॆ lacking Tyr-439 or Tyr-494 individually. These data indicate that Tyr-439 in SH2-Bॆ is phosphorylated by JAK2 in vivo. Whether or not Tyr-494 is also phosphorylated is more difficult to discern. The lack of a reproducible, substantial decrease in the αPY signal when Tyr-494 is mutated may indicate that 4G10 αPY does not recognize pY494, that phosphorylation at Tyr-494 is very labile or undergoes dephosphorylation after the cells are lysed, that Tyr-494 is not phosphorylated to as great an extent as Tyr-439, that the relatively small decrease in overall phosphorylation upon mutation of Tyr-494 cannot be reproducibly detected by Western blotting with αPY, or that Tyr-494 is not phosphorylated by JAK2 in intact cells.Figure 9PDGFR phosphorylates Tyr-439 SH2-Bॆ. A, plasmid (1 ॖg,lanes 1–6) encoding wild type SH2-Bॆ was transfected into COS-7 cells with control plasmid (2 ॖg, lanes 1 and2) or plasmid encoding PDGFRB (2 ॖg, lanes 3–6). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were deprived of serum overnight and stimulated with 25 ng/ml PDGF-BB (lanes 2, 4, and 6) or vehicle (lanes 1,3, and 5) for 15 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting (IB) with αPY. Molecular weights are indicated as well as the migration of PDGFR and SH2-Bॆ. B, plasmid (1 ॖg, lanes 1–4) encoding wild type SH2-Bॆ was transfected into COS-7 cells with control plasmid (2 ॖg, lanes 1 and 2) or plasmid encoding PDGFRB (2 ॖg, lanes 3 and 4). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were deprived of serum overnight and stimulated with 25 ng/ml PDGF-BB (lanes 2 and4) or vehicle (lanes 1 and 3) for 15 min. Proteins were immunoprecipitated (IP) with αSH2-Bॆ and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by immunoblotting (IB) with αPY (upper panel) or αSH2-Bॆ (lower panel). C, plasmid (lanes 1–5) encoding PDGFR (2 ॖg) or JAK2 (0.5 ॖg, lanes 6–8) was transfected into COS-7 cells with plasmid (1 ॖg) encoding wild type SH2-Bॆ (lanes 1 and 6) or the indicated mutant form of SH2-Bॆ (lanes 2–5 and 7–8). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were deprived of serum overnight. Proteins were immunoprecipitated (IP) with αSH2-Bॆ and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by immunoblotting (IB) with αPY (upper panel) or αSH2-Bॆ (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine more definitively whether Tyr-494 in SH2-Bॆ is phosphorylated by JAK2 in vivo, and to confirm that Tyr-439 in SH2-Bॆ is phosphorylated by JAK2 in vivo, we used [32P]orthophosphate to label SH2-Bॆ in vivoand subjected 32P-labeled SH2-Bॆ to phosphopeptide mapping. To maximize the amount of 32P-labeled SH2-Bॆ recovered, cells were treated prior to lysis with the phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate for 6 min (Fig. 4,A–C) or as long as 30 min (Fig. 4, D andE). We anticipated that SH2-Bॆ might be phosphorylated on serines and threonines as well as tyrosines in vivo (1Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Google Scholar). Therefore, the first dimension (thin layer electrophoresis) was run at pH 3.5 rather than pH 8.9 as seen in Fig. 2, because we predicted that pH 3.5 would provide greater resolution of multiply phosphorylated peptides from SH2-Bॆ. The map of 32P-labeled SH2-Bॆ expressed in the absence of JAK2 contained two detectable phosphopeptides after a 12-h exposure (Fig. 4A, Spots a and b). A longer exposure (21 h) of this map reveals one additional peptide (Fig. 4B, Spot c). When SH2-Bॆ was co-expressed with JAK2, the map of SH2-Bॆ contained at least two additional phosphopeptides (Fig. 4, C andD, Spots 1 and 2). Migration ofSpots 1 and 2 is similar to migration of peptides containing pY439 and pY494, respectively, observed in maps of SH2-Bॆ phosphorylated in vitro.

To address this controversy, we compared remnant clearance in two mouse models in which apoE is primarily derived either from hepatocytes or from an extrahepatic source. Hypomorphic apoE mice universally express reduced levels of apoE in all tissues, with the liver remaining the primary source of apoE. This mouse model of hepatocyte-derived apoE was compared withApoe −/− mice transplanted with mouse bone marrow as a model of primarily non-hepatocyte-derived apoE. Immunohistochemical analysis of liver sections revealed that only the hepatocyte-derived apoE model had detectable levels of apoE on hepatic sinusoidal surfaces. The non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model with plasma apoE levels similar to those in the hepatocyte-derived model had 2-fold more total plasma cholesterol, 4-fold more total plasma triglycerides, and 8-fold higher levels of apoB48, similar toApoe −/− mice. Both the hepatocyte-derived and the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE models had delayed clearance of an infused bolus of 125I-labeled remnants compared with wild-type mice. However, after 3 h, plasma remnants reached wild-type levels only in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, which had accumulated 70 ± 5% of wild-type levels of remnants in the liver while the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model had accumulated only 38 ± 4%. These results demonstrate the existence of a role for both hepatically derived and localized apoE in remnant clearance. This role likely represents the enrichment of remnants sequestered on hepatocyte, with hepatocyte-derived apoE, facilitating their receptor-mediated internalization.

Hepatocyte-derived apoE has been proposed to promote remnant clearance and uptake through a two-step process referred to as secretion-capture (3Mahley R.W. Ji Z.-S. J.

In the first step, a portion of newly secreted apoE interacts with HSPG and remains bound to hepatocyte cell surfaces; the remainder is released into the space of Disse, where it serves to enrich lipoproteins (11Ji Z.-S.

Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1413-1420Google Scholar). In the second step, sequestered remnants are further enriched with hepatocyte-derived apoE and are internalized into hepatocytes through processes mediated by receptors, including the LDLR and the LRP (7Kowal R.C.

When apoE/HSPG interactions are disrupted in vivoby intravenous heparinase infusion, remnant clearance is severely inhibited, supporting the importance of the secretion-capture role of apoE in remnant clearance (22Ji Z.-S.

Moreover, evidence from mouse models expressing apoE exclusively from extrahepatic sources suggests that hepatic apoE expression is not absolutely required for remnant clearance or for normal plasma cholesterol levels (25Linton M.F.

Finally, it is not clear whether hepatic apoE expression is required for remnant clearance in mice lacking the LDLR (24Yu K.C.-W. Jiang Y. Chen W. Cooper A.D. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11064-11068Google Scholar) the generation of hypomorphic apoE (hypoE) mice that express reduced levels of Arg-61 apoE, which is similar to human apoE4 in that it displays apoE4 domain interaction. The reduction in apoE levels is caused by a neomycin (neo) cassette flanked by loxP sites in Apoe intron 3. However, the expression pattern of the hypomorphic allele remains normal, with the liver producing the majority of apoE in these mice (30Raffaı̈ R.L. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11064-11068Google Scholar). Excision of the neo cassette by Cre-mediated gene repair restores normal expression of the allele in all tissues (31Raffaı̈ R.L. Dong L.-M. Farese Jr., R.V. Weisgraber K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11587-11591Google Scholar). Despite having only 2–5% of wild-type plasma apoE levels, hypoE mice display a nearly normal lipoprotein profile. However, inApoe −/− mice with similar plasma apoE levels after transplantation with varying amounts of wild-type bone marrow, remnants accumulate (32Hasty A.H. Linton M.F. Swift L.L. Fazio S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1529-1538Google Scholar). It was not until plasma apoE levels exceeded 10% of wild-type levels that remnant levels approached normal. The more efficient remnant clearance in hypoE mice suggests the importance of hepatocyte-derived apoE and the secretion-capture role of apoE. This study was designed to address the controversy concerning the importance of both hepatically derived and localized apoE in remnant clearance in in vivo models. To this end, remnant clearance was assessed in hypoE mice (a model of hepatocyte-derived apoE) and inApoe −/− mice expressing similar levels of Arg-61 apoE after bone marrow transplantation (a model of non-hepatocyte-derived apoE). Our results demonstrate that remnant clearance is more efficient in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model and provide in vivo evidence for the importance of hepatically derived and localized apoE in remnant clearance. The generation of hypoE mice, or the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, has previously been described (30Raffaı̈ R.L. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11064-11068Google Scholar). Briefly, a neo cassette flanked byloxP sites was inserted into Apoe intron 3 by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells to help follow the replacement of the human equivalent of Thr-61 by an arginine, aimed at creating a model of apoE4 (31Raffaı̈ R.L.

The presence of the neo cassette inApoe intron 3 results in reduced apoE mRNA levels in all tissues and organs (30Raffaı̈ R.L. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11064-11068Google Scholar). The apoE mRNA levels in the liver, brain, and spleen in targeted mice are ∼5% of those in wild-type mice, resulting in plasma apoE levels equal to 0.05–0.12 mg/dl (∼2–5% of wild-type levels) as determined by Western blot analysis using mouse apoE as standards, with the liver remaining the primary source of apoE. However, following Cre-mediated excision of theneo cassette in targeted mice, normal expression of the Arg-61 Apoe allele is restored. The mice were weaned at 21 days of age, housed in a barrier facility with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, and fed a chow diet containing 4.5% fat (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO). Mice expressing Arg-61 apoE primarily from a peripheral source were generated by transplanting Cre-deleted Arg-61 mouse bone marrow into lethally irradiated Apoe −/− mice. Bone marrow was collected by flushing femurs and tibias with RPMI 1640 containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 10 units/ml heparin (Sigma). Cells were washed, counted, resuspended in RPMI, and used immediately for transplantation into lethally irradiated Apoe −/− recipient mice. The cells (5 × 106 in a volume of 300 μl) were injected into the tail vein 4 h after irradiation with 900 rads from a cesium gamma source. Mice were fasted for 4 h, anesthetized with avertin, and flush perfused with PBS, pH 7.2, and 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.2, at room temperature for 5 min. Hardened liver lobes were cut into slices 2–3 mm thick and further fixed overnight by immersion in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.2, at 4 °C. Slices were briefly washed in PBS, pH 7.2, drained, placed in molds with Tissue-Tek compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Blocks were held at −70 °C until cut into 6–8-μm thick sections on a Leica Frigocut 2800 cryostat and mounted on glass slides. Slides were immunostained as follows at room temperature unless otherwise indicated. Sections were incubated in sequence with rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse apoE antiserum (31Raffaı̈ R.L. Dong L.-M. Farese Jr., R.V. Weisgraber K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11587-11591Google Scholar) (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) at 0.4 μg/ml, with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate from a tyramide signal amplification kit (TSA Fluorescein System, NEL 701, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (1:500), and finally with fluorescein tyramide from the same kit (1:100). Slides were coverslipped after application of Vectashield anti-fade mounting medium (Vector H-1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and imaged by epifluorescence using a Nikon E600 microscope equipped with a SPOT 2 digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Lipids and lipoproteins were measured in age-matched male mice that had been fasted for 4 h, anesthetized, and bled by retro-orbital puncture. Lipoproteins were fractionated by fast-performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences), and plasma and lipoprotein fractions were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis (Universal Gel/8, Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX). Cholesterol and triglyceride levels in plasma and FPLC fractions were determined with colorimetric assays (Spectrum, Abbott, Irving, TX, and Triglycerides, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively). The statistical significance of differences in lipid levels was determined by the Student'st test. Fasted mouse plasma was subjected to SDS-PAGE with 10–20% or 4–15% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was performed with rabbit antiserum against mouse apoE (31Raffaı̈ R.L. Dong L.-M. Farese Jr., R.V. Weisgraber K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11587-11591Google Scholar) and apoB (30Raffaı̈ R.L. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11064-11068Google Scholar). Western blots were incubated with primary antibodies (1:2000), and bound primary antibodies were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen). Signals were generated by incubating membranes with chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and exposing them to x-ray film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). Signals were quantified with phosphorimaging and quantification software (Quantity One, Bio-Rad). Remnant lipoproteins were prepared from plasma, adjusted to a density of d = 1.04 g/ml, from fasted Apoe −/− mice. Plasma was centrifuged in a Beckman ultracentrifuge in a TL-100.3 rotor at 80,000 rpm for 16 h at 8 °C. Remnants were isolated and recentrifuged for two additional 16 h periods at d= 1.04 g/ml to ensure removal of plasma albumin. The purity of the remnant preparation was examined by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue, which revealed apoB48 as the major protein component followed by apoAI; apoB100 was present in trace amounts. Remnants were labeled with Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) by a modification of the iodine monochloride method first described by McFarlane (33McFarlane A.S. Nature. 1958; 182: 53Google Scholar). 125I-labeled remnants were extensively dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.2, and adjusted to a specific activity of 65,000 cpm/μg protein. Labeled remnants (24 μg of protein in a volume of 400 μl of PBS) were injected into the tail vein of recipient mice (wild-type, hepatocyte-derived apoE model, non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model, and Apoe −/−mice, n = 3/group). Blood (50 μl) was collected from the retro-orbital venous plexus into heparinized tubes 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 180 min after injection of 125I-labeled remnants. Aliquots of plasma were analyzed for radioactivity on a gamma counter (Packard). Total counts were calculated assuming that plasma represents 3.5% of total body weight (34Hussain M.M. Maxfield F.R. Más-Oliva J. Tabas I. Ji Z.-S. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13936-13940Google Scholar). At 180 min, the mice were anesthetized with avertin and flush perfused with PBS, pH 7.2. Whole livers were collected, and the amount of 125I in the liver was determined. The impact of the tissue source of apoE on remnant clearance was assessed by studying two mouse models expressing low levels of plasma apoE derived primarily from liver hepatocytes or primarily from a peripheral source. We first examined liver-associated apoE in both mouse models. Like wild-type mice, the hepatocyte-derived apoE model had detectable levels of apoE bound to hepatic sinusoidal surfaces, although at reduced levels (Fig.1). In contrast, and similar toApoe −/− mice, the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model had little if any detectable apoE bound to hepatic sinusoidal surfaces. However, unlike Apoe −/− mice, the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model had some apoE-immunoreactive cells in liver sections, which likely represent macrophage-derived Kupfer cells expressing apoE or cells that have taken up apoE from the circulation. Thus, the enrichment of apoE on hepatic sinusoidal surfaces required local apoE expression, present only in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model. Despite having different levels of liver-associated apoE, both the hepatocyte-derived and the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE models expressed similarly low levels of apoE in plasma, corresponding to ∼2–5% of wild-type apoE levels in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model and ∼2-fold more in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model (Fig.2). The tissue source of apoE resulted in a marked difference in plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels. Plasma cholesterol levels in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model were 2-fold higher than those in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model (230 ± 50 versus 98 ± 18 mg/dl,n = 6, p = 0.02) and plasma triglyceride levels were 4-fold higher in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model than in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model (176 ± 27versus 45 ± 12 mg/dl, n = 6,p = 0.03). Fractionation of mouse plasma showed a marked difference in the lipoprotein profiles (Fig.3). The non-hepatocyte-derived apoE mice transported 60–80% of plasma cholesterol as remnant lipoproteins. In contrast, the hepatocyte-derived apoE mice transported only 30–40% of plasma cholesterol as remnant lipoproteins (30Raffaı̈ R.L. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11064-11068Google Scholar), which is more like wild-type mice that transport the majority of their plasma cholesterol as high density lipoprotein (17Ishibashi S. Herz J. Maeda N. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4431-4435Google Scholar). Thus, the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model transports 2–3-fold more remnant lipoprotein-associated cholesterol and less high density lipoprotein cholesterol than the hepatocyte-derived model. Agarose gel electrophoresis of mouse plasma confirmed the more normal lipoprotein profile in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model and the accumulation of remnants in the non-hepatocyte-derived model (data not shown). The distribution of apoE among the classes of plasma lipoproteins in both mouse models was determined by pooling plasma FPLC fractions into lipoprotein classes, followed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.4, apoE was present in the remnant fractions in both mouse models and demonstrates that the distribution pattern of apoE among plasma lipoprotein classes in both mouse models is identical. SDS-PAGE Western blot analysis of mouse plasma demonstrated that both models accumulate apoB48. The non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model had ∼8-fold more plasma apoB48 than the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, but both models had similar levels of plasma apoB100, which was lower than in wild-type mice (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with the more rapid removal of apoB48-containing remnants in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model than the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model. Taken together, these results demonstrate that remnant clearance is more effective in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model than in the non-hepatocyte-derived model due to hepatically derived and localized apoE. The importance of the source of apoE synthesis for remnant uptake was further assessed by measuring the plasma clearance and liver uptake of 125I-labeled apoE-deficient mouse remnants (Fig.6 A). Although both the hepatocyte-derived apoE model and the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model had an overall delay in remnant clearance relative to wild-type mice, only the hepatocyte-derived apoE model reached wild-type levels at 3 h. Moreover, the livers of the hepatocyte-derived apoE model (n = 3) contained 70 ± 5% of the total radioactivity found in wild-type mouse livers, whereas the livers of the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model (n = 3) contained only 38 ± 4% after 3 h. Contrary to wild-type mice, the initial rates of remnant clearance in the hepatocyte-derived apoE and apoE null mice were identical, indicating that the initial rates in these models were not affected by the levels of hepatically localized apoE or by the number of apoE molecules per remnant (Fig. 6, A and B). Rather, the difference in the rate of remnant clearance between the two models was apparent only at the later time points diverging after the first 30 min. These results demonstrate that apoE synthesized by liver hepatocytes favors an overall greater capacity for liver-mediated remnant uptake than apoE synthesized by extrahepatic tissue. Moreover, these results support a role for apoE-enrichment of remnants sequestered at the surface of hepatocytes and are consistent with the plasma lipoprotein profiles of fasted mice that show a significant accumulation of remnants in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model, but not in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model (Fig. 3). This study presents in vivo evidence that demonstrates that the site of apoE synthesis significantly influences remnant clearance and, consequently, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels in mice. Hepatically derived and localized apoE in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model was found to be more effective than macrophage-derived apoE in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model in promoting the plasma clearance and liver uptake of apoB48-containing remnants. Moreover, the low levels of hepatically derived and localized apoE in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model influenced the late but not the initial part of remnant clearance. Because the hepatocyte-derived apoE model expresses Arg-61 apoE, the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model was generated by using Cre-deleted Arg-61 bone marrow to allow for a direct comparison with the hepatocyte-derived apoE model. In these mice, Cre-mediated excision of the neo cassette in Apoe intron 3 results in normal apoE expression levels in all tissues, including macrophages (31Raffaı̈ R.L. Dong L.-M. Farese Jr., R.V. Weisgraber K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11587-11591Google Scholar). The normal lipid and lipoprotein levels in Cre-deleted Arg-61 mice suggest that Arg-61 apoE and wild-type apoE are equally effective in remnant clearance (31Raffaı̈ R.L. Dong L.-M. Farese Jr., R.V. Weisgraber K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11587-11591Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis of liver sections demonstrated that the hepatocyte-derived apoE model contained significant levels of hepatically localized apoE, whereas the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model did not. The hepatically localized apoE in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model likely originated mostly from hepatocytes, as the expression pattern of the hypomorphic Apoe allele in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model is normal, with the liver producing the majority of apoE in these mice (30Raffaı̈ R.L. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11064-11068Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the hepatically localized apoE in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model originated in the periphery. The higher plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model relative to those in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, despite similarly low apoE plasma levels, is consistent with a more efficient clearance of remnants in the hepatocyte-derived model. The non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model accumulated 2-fold more plasma cholesterol and 4-fold more plasma triglycerides than the hepatocyte-derived apoE model. The 8-fold greater accumulation of apoB48-containing remnants in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model is also consistent with the site of apoE synthesis influencing remnant clearance, despite both models having similar levels of plasma apoE. In the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, low levels of hepatic apoE synthesis overcome to a significant degree the deficiency in remnant clearance seen in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model. In contrast to wild-type mice and similar to Apoe −/− mice, both models had equally low levels of plasma apoB100. The low levels of plasma apoE in the two models apparently failed to sufficiently enrich apoB48-containing remnants with apoE, causing them to become poor competitors with apoB100-containing LDL for binding to the LDLR. Alternatively, the reduced levels of apoB100 in both models may result from decreased apoB100 secretion by the liver. However, hepatic apoE expression has been reported to influence the production rate of both apoB48 and apoB100 in mice (35Maugeais C. Tietge U.J.F. Tsukamoto K. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1673-1679Google Scholar). The finding that the levels of apoB48 are far greater in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model than in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, emphasizes the importance of hepatically derived and localized apoE in remnant clearance, as the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model likely secretes reduced levels of apoB48, similar to Apoe −/− mice (35Maugeais C. Tietge U.J.F. Tsukamoto K. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1673-1679Google Scholar). Thus, a direct assessment of apoB secretion rates in both models will be necessary to confirm this possibility. Lastly, remnant clearance in both models may have been influenced by the recently described recycling pathway of apoE in liver hepatocytes (36Swift L.L. Farkas M.H. Major A.S. Valyi-Nagy K. Linton M.F. Fazio S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22965-22970Google Scholar). However, as only 6% of internalized apoE was reported to be re-secreted by hepatocytes, the pathway likely plays a minor role in mediating remnant clearance in our models that have very low levels of plasma apoE. Directly comparing remnant clearance in both the hepatocyte-derived and non-hepatocyte-derived apoE models confirmed the conclusions drawn from the steady-state plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels, which indicate that hepatocyte-derived apoE is more effective than non-hepatocyte-derived apoE in remnant clearance. When compared with wild-type mice, the initial phase of remnant clearance was similarly reduced in both mouse models and comparable with apoE null mice. As the initial phase likely reflects the binding and sequestration of remnants on hepatocyte cell surfaces in the space of Disse, the levels of apoE molecules per remnant as well as the levels of hepatically localized apoE in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model do not appear to contribute significantly to this process. Moreover, the differences in lipoprotein pool sizes in the models did not affect the rapid initial clearance of remnants. However, the near normal level of remnant clearance after 3 h only in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, suggests that hepatically derived and localized apoE contribute substantially to a slower component of remnant clearance, which likely represents liver-uptake. Indeed, livers from the hepatocyte-derived apoE model contained 70 ± 5% of normal 125I levels, whereas livers from the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model contained only 38 ± 4%. In the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, apoE-poor remnants sequestered on hepatocytes likely become enriched with newly secreted apoE in the space of Disse or by the passive exchange from existing hepatically localized apoE, allowing for accelerated receptor-mediated internalization through the LDLR and the LRP or through HSPG alone. However, in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model, a large proportion of sequestered apoE-poor remnants likely redistribute to and accumulate in the circulation due to the absence of apoE-enrichment in the space of Disse and inefficient receptor-mediated uptake. Studies of remnant clearance in an isolated mouse liver perfusion model have recently questioned the importance of hepatic synthesis and localization of apoE and thus the importance of the secretion-capture role of apoE in remnant clearance (24Yu K.C.-W. Jiang Y. Chen W. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1715-1727Google Scholar). Livers fromApoe −/− mice cleared an infused bolus of apoE-containing rat chylomicron remnants as efficiently as those from wild-type mice, which, unlike livers fromApoe −/− mice, had abundant levels of apoE localized on hepatocyte cell surfaces (24Yu K.C.-W. Jiang Y. Chen W. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1715-1727Google Scholar). More recent data from this model suggested that apoE/HSPG interactions on hepatocyte cell surfaces are not required for efficient remnant uptake (29Yu K.C.-W. Chen W. Cooper A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1387-1394Google Scholar). Rather, apoE/LRP interactions were proposed to mediate the direct sequestration and internalization of remnants. Interestingly, and in parallel to the results observed in the mouse liver perfusion model (24Yu K.C.-W. Jiang Y. Chen W. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1715-1727Google Scholar), the absence of hepatically localized apoE in both the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model and inApoe −/− mice did not influence the early phase of remnant clearance relative to the hepatocyte-derived apoE model. Indeed, all three of these mouse models displayed similarly delayed initial rates of remnant clearance relative to wild-type mice. However, a shortcoming of the liver-perfusion model is that the results cannot necessarily be extrapolated to explain the steady-state levels of remnants in mice. For example, in apoE null mice, the perfused liver effectively cleared an infused bolus of remnants, whereas at steady-state the mice accumulate remnants in plasma. In contrast, ourin vivo models directly focus on the steady-state levels of remnants in mice. In conclusion, this in vivo study in mice expressing apoE from hepatic versus extrahepatic sources demonstrates and underscores the importance of hepatically derived and localized apoE for efficient remnant clearance by the liver. Because remnant clearance operates close to its sub-optimal level in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, the model should be informative in revealing the relative contributions of the LDLR and the LRP in remnant clearance in the context of low levels of plasma apoE. The hepatocyte-derived apoE model can also serve to determine the contribution of other proteins known to be ligands for remnant clearance such as hepatic lipase (37Shafi S. Brady S.E. Bensadoun A. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 709-720Google Scholar, 38Dichek H.L. Johnson S.M. Akeefe H. Lo G.T. Sage E. Yap C.E. Mahley R.W. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 201-210Google Scholar). We thank Drs.

Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Google Scholar, 15Witherow D.S. Wang Q. Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Chen J. Willars G.B. Slepak V.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24872-24880Google Scholar). The failure to demonstrate native Gॆ5-Gγ complexes is complicated by the known instability of such complexes in detergent solution (10Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Google Scholar, 16Jones M.B. Garrison J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 126-133Google Scholar). Thus, purifications employing detergent may fail to identify potential Gॆ5-Gγ complexes that could dissociate in the process of isolation (16Jones M.B. Garrison J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 126-133Google Scholar). Alternative approaches to assess the biologic importance of the Gॆ5-Gγ interaction demonstratedin vitro are needed.We recently demonstrated the nuclear expression of Gॆ5 in neurons and brain (17Zhang J.H. Barr V.A. Mo Y. Rojkova A.M. Liu S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10284-10289Google Scholar). In this study chimeric protein constructs containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to wild-type Gॆ5 demonstrated nuclear localization in transfected PC12 cells, but not GFP fusions with a mutant Gॆ5 with proline substitutions in its putative coiled-coil domain. Introduction of prolines into the putative α-helical N-terminal region of Gॆ5 would disrupt its ability to form a coiled-coil with both Gγ subunits and RGS proteins containing GGL domains. Such a Gॆ5 mutant therefore fails to provide mechanistic insight as to which of its two potential heterodimeric conformations is important for nuclear targeting. We describe here a Gγ-selective Gॆ5 mutant that fails to undergo nuclear localization in transfected PC12 and HEK-293 cells. In the latter cells the nuclear expression of wild-type Gॆ5 is dependent on RGS7 co-transfection. These results suggest it is interaction with the GGL domain containing RGS proteins that directs nuclear localization of Gॆ5. Additional studies of RGS7 do not support a role for a putative interaction with 14-3-3 proteins in Gॆ5nuclear localization.DISCUSSIONThe unique ability of Gॆ5 to interact selectively with Gα- and Gॆγ-regulated effectors as a Gॆ5-Gγ complex and with RGS proteins 6, 7, 9, and 11 as a Gॆ5-RGS heterodimer may be critical to the role of Gॆ5 in signal transduction. New approaches are needed to assess the biological importance of the Gॆ5-Gγ interactions so well documented in vitro since detergent-based purifications might miss or underestimate the presence of native Gॆ5-Gγ complexes. Besides the mutational strategy employed here, other potential analytical tools such as conformation-dependent antibodies or selective proteolysis specific for the Gγ-bound conformation of Gॆ5 would be valuable in this regard. Although well documented purifications from defined subcellular fractions of adult tissues have demonstrated only the presence of Gॆ5-RGS complexes and not Gॆ5-Gγ complexes (15Witherow D.S. Wang Q. Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Chen J. Willars G.B. Slepak V.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24872-24880Google Scholar), the potential importance of Gॆ5-Gγ complex formation during ontogeny or in highly localized brain regions remains to be addressed.Several observations in this study suggest Gॆ5 and its mutants are capable of a wider range of interactions with Gγ2 and/or RGS7 than the most stringent assays, such as co-immunoprecipitation, would seem to suggest. Both wild-type Gॆ5 and the Gॆ5-QAAC mutant stimulated PLC-ॆ in a Gγ2-dependent fashion, although neither co-immunoprecipitated Gγ2. Co-transfection of RGS7 was observed to enhance the expression of the Gॆ5-YMIN mutant even though the pair could not be immunoprecipitated. Several laboratories (15Witherow D.S. Wang Q. Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Chen J. Willars G.B. Slepak V.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24872-24880Google Scholar, 35Kovoor A. Chen C.K. He W. Wensel T.G. Simon M.I. Lester H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3397-3402Google Scholar) have documented the ability of Gॆ5-RGS and Gॆ5-Gγ protein interaction to mutually stabilize the heterodimeric subunits. Since the Gॆ5-YMIN mutant was designed to impair interaction between a hydrophobic pocket on the side of the Gॆ5ॆ-propeller and a critical Trp residue in the RGS protein GGL domain (10Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Google Scholar), the ability of RGS7 to partially stabilize the Gॆ5-YMIN mutant may reflect an RGS7-Gॆ5interaction outside this vicinity. The potential for such an interaction was recently demonstrated in C. elegans between an isolated N-terminal fragment of the RGS7 homolog EGL-10 and the Gॆ5 homolog GPB-2 (38Patikoglou G.A. Koelle M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47004-47013Google Scholar). The finding that only the Gॆ5-YMIN mutant and Gॆ1 were able to co-immunoprecipitate Gγ2 from detergent lysates complements an experiment performed by Snow et al. (10Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Google Scholar) in which the strength of Gॆ5-Gγ2 interaction in detergent solution was greatly enhanced by replacing the conserved Phe-61 in Gγ2 with a corresponding Trp residue characteristic of GGL domains, and further supports their model of the Gॆ5-GGL/Gγ interface.In previous studies of Gॆ5 nuclear localization the possible requirement for Gॆ5-Gγ interaction for nuclear targeting was not fully assessed (17Zhang J.H. Barr V.A. Mo Y. Rojkova A.M. Liu S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10284-10289Google Scholar). Nuclear localization of G protein heterotrimers including apparent Gॆγ complexes has been reported in rat liver (39Takei Y. Kurosu H. Takahashi K. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5085-5089Google Scholar) and thrombin- and phorbol ester-treated Swiss 3T3 cells (40Crouch M.F. Simson L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 189-198Google Scholar). In the previous study of Gॆ5, a mutant GFP-Gॆ5 fusion protein that failed to undergo nuclear localization was likely deficient in both Gγ and GGL domain interaction due to double proline insertions in the Gॆ5α-helical N-terminal region (17Zhang J.H. Barr V.A. Mo Y. Rojkova A.M. Liu S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10284-10289Google Scholar). This approach thus provided little insight into the heterodimerization requirements for Gॆ5nuclear targeting.The studies described herein strongly suggest Gγ interaction is insufficient for Gॆ5 nuclear targeting and that heterodimerization with a GGL domain-containing RGS protein such as RGS6 or -7 is critical. In HEK-293 cells, which do not express endogenous Gॆ5 or RGS7, the nuclear targeting of wild-type Gॆ5 (or the RGS7-interacting Gॆ5-QAAC mutant) could only be reconstituted by RGS7 and not Gγ2 co-transfection. Next, because the Gॆ5-YMIN mutant failed to localize to the nucleus in either 293 or PC12 cells, despite its tight binding to Gγ demonstrated in vitro, the key molecular determinants of nuclear targeting appear to be intrinsic to the RGS protein, not to the Gॆ5 or Gγ subunits. However, the approach utilized here cannot exclude that mutation of the 4 residues in the Gॆ5-YMIN mutant abrogated a nuclear localization signal (NLS), but this is unlikely for two reasons. No recognizable NLS motifs could be discerned in the native Gॆ5 sequence (41Makkerh J.P. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1025-1027Google Scholar). Furthermore, when tested in HEK-293 cells neither untagged or HA epitope-tagged wild-type Gॆ5 demonstrated nuclear expression when co-transfected with Gγ2 making the presence of an occult NLS on Gॆ5 unlikely.Demonstration of a requirement for RGS protein binding is consistent with several reports demonstrating the nuclear targeting of RGS2 (42Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Google Scholar, 43Heximer S.P. Lim H. Bernard J.L. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14195-14203Google Scholar, 44Song L. Zmijewski J.W. Jope R.S.

Peralta E.G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32828-32834Google Scholar), splice variants of RGS3 (46Dulin N.O. Pratt P. Tiruppathi C. Niu J. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21317-21323Google Scholar), and RGS12 (47Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29660-29671Google Scholar). Mutation of a key serine residue in a conserved 14-3-3-binding site in the core RGS domain of RGS7 (Ser434 → Ala), a site present in many RGS proteins including RGS2 and RGS3 (48Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Leparc G.G. Kim E. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28167-28172Google Scholar), made no difference in the steady-state distribution of RGS7 in resting PC12 cells (data not shown). This would seem to argue against a major role for 14-3-3 binding in the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic distribution of Gॆ5-RGS complexes in resting cells. Whether phosphorylation or other post-translational modification of Gॆ5-RGS complexes might govern their nuclear localization under stimulated conditions, and how potential nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Gॆ5-RGS heterodimers might mediate information transfer in the cell in response to extracellular signals remain two central questions for future study. In eukaryotic cells seven transmembrane-spanning receptors regulate intracellular processes in response to extracellular signals through their interaction with signal-transducing heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) (1Dessauer C.W. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Clin. Sci. (Colch.). 1996; 91: 527-537Google Scholar). Complementary DNAs from five G protein ॆ subunit genes (Gॆ1–5) have been identified by molecular cloning. The Gॆ5 isoform shares much less homology with other isoforms (∼507) and is preferentially expressed in brain (2Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Google Scholar). A splice variant of Gॆ5, Gॆ5-long (Gॆ5L), is present in retina that contains a 42-amino acid N-terminal extension (3Watson A.J. Aragay A.M. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28154-28160Google Scholar). Gॆ5 is the only Gॆ subunit known with the potential to assemble with either Gγ subunits or regulators of G protein signaling (RGS)1 proteins. Gॆ5 can heterodimerize with Gγ (2Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Google Scholar, 4Zhang S.Y. Coso O.A. Lee C.H. Gutkind J.S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol.

Other in vitro studies show that Gॆ5 and Gॆ5L, but not the other Gॆ isoforms, can form tight heterodimers with RGS proteins 6, 7, and 11, an interaction mediated by a Gγ-like (GGL) domain present in a subfamily of RGS proteins (9Snow B.E.

Co-transfection of RGS7 was observed to enhance the expression of the Gॆ5-YMIN mutant even though the pair could not be immunoprecipitated. Several laboratories (15Witherow D.S. Wang Q. Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Chen J. Willars G.B. Slepak V.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24872-24880Google Scholar, 35Kovoor A. Chen C.K. He W. Wensel T.G. Simon M.I. Lester H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3397-3402Google Scholar) have documented the ability of Gॆ5-RGS and Gॆ5-Gγ protein interaction to mutually stabilize the heterodimeric subunits. Since the Gॆ5-YMIN mutant was designed to impair interaction between a hydrophobic pocket on the side of the Gॆ5ॆ-propeller and a critical Trp residue in the RGS protein GGL domain (10Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Google Scholar), the ability of RGS7 to partially stabilize the Gॆ5-YMIN mutant may reflect an RGS7-Gॆ5interaction outside this vicinity. The potential for such an interaction was recently demonstrated in C. elegans between an isolated N-terminal fragment of the RGS7 homolog EGL-10 and the Gॆ5 homolog GPB-2 (38Patikoglou G.A. Koelle M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47004-47013Google Scholar). The finding that only the Gॆ5-YMIN mutant and Gॆ1 were able to co-immunoprecipitate Gγ2 from detergent lysates complements an experiment performed by Snow et al. (10Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Google Scholar) in which the strength of Gॆ5-Gγ2 interaction in detergent solution was greatly enhanced by replacing the conserved Phe-61 in Gγ2 with a corresponding Trp residue characteristic of GGL domains, and further supports their model of the Gॆ5-GGL/Gγ interface. In previous studies of Gॆ5 nuclear localization the possible requirement for Gॆ5-Gγ interaction for nuclear targeting was not fully assessed (17Zhang J.H. Barr V.A. Mo Y. Rojkova A.M. Liu S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10284-10289Google Scholar). Nuclear localization of G protein heterotrimers including apparent Gॆγ complexes has been reported in rat liver (39Takei Y. Kurosu H. Takahashi K. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5085-5089Google Scholar) and thrombin- and phorbol ester-treated Swiss 3T3 cells (40Crouch M.F. Simson L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 189-198Google Scholar). In the previous study of Gॆ5, a mutant GFP-Gॆ5 fusion protein that failed to undergo nuclear localization was likely deficient in both Gγ and GGL domain interaction due to double proline insertions in the Gॆ5α-helical N-terminal region (17Zhang J.H. Barr V.A. Mo Y. Rojkova A.M. Liu S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10284-10289Google Scholar). This approach thus provided little insight into the heterodimerization requirements for Gॆ5nuclear targeting. The studies described herein strongly suggest Gγ interaction is insufficient for Gॆ5 nuclear targeting and that heterodimerization with a GGL domain-containing RGS protein such as RGS6 or -7 is critical. In HEK-293 cells, which do not express endogenous Gॆ5 or RGS7, the nuclear targeting of wild-type Gॆ5 (or the RGS7-interacting Gॆ5-QAAC mutant) could only be reconstituted by RGS7 and not Gγ2 co-transfection. Next, because the Gॆ5-YMIN mutant failed to localize to the nucleus in either 293 or PC12 cells, despite its tight binding to Gγ demonstrated in vitro, the key molecular determinants of nuclear targeting appear to be intrinsic to the RGS protein, not to the Gॆ5 or Gγ subunits. However, the approach utilized here cannot exclude that mutation of the 4 residues in the Gॆ5-YMIN mutant abrogated a nuclear localization signal (NLS), but this is unlikely for two reasons. No recognizable NLS motifs could be discerned in the native Gॆ5 sequence (41Makkerh J.P. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1025-1027Google Scholar). Furthermore, when tested in HEK-293 cells neither untagged or HA epitope-tagged wild-type Gॆ5 demonstrated nuclear expression when co-transfected with Gγ2 making the presence of an occult NLS on Gॆ5 unlikely. Demonstration of a requirement for RGS protein binding is consistent with several reports demonstrating the nuclear targeting of RGS2 (42Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Google Scholar, 43Heximer S.P. Lim H. Bernard J.L. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14195-14203Google Scholar, 44Song L. Zmijewski J.W. Jope R.S. Biochem. Biophys.

Mutation of a key serine residue in a conserved 14-3-3-binding site in the core RGS domain of RGS7 (Ser434 → Ala), a site present in many RGS proteins including RGS2 and RGS3 (48Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Leparc G.G. Kim E. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28167-28172Google Scholar), made no difference in the steady-state distribution of RGS7 in resting PC12 cells (data not shown). This would seem to argue against a major role for 14-3-3 binding in the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic distribution of Gॆ5-RGS complexes in resting cells. Whether phosphorylation or other post-translational modification of Gॆ5-RGS complexes might govern their nuclear localization under stimulated conditions, and how potential nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Gॆ5-RGS heterodimers might mediate information transfer in the cell in response to extracellular signals remain two central questions for future study."
https://openalex.org/W2047961060,"Synaptosome-associated proteins SNAP-23/25, members of a family of proteins essential for exocytosis, have a highly conserved central cysteine-rich domain that plays an important role in membrane targeting. More than one cysteine in this domain is modified by palmitic acid through a thioester linkage. In an effort to address the biological significance of acylation of this domain, we have generated synthetic peptides corresponding to the cysteine-rich region of SNAP-23 and covalently modified the cysteines with palmitic acid. The interaction of acylated and nonacylated peptides with lipid vesicles and natural membranes has been investigated. Our results indicate that palmitoylation is essential for membrane association. The palmitoylated peptides were able to fuse both model and natural membranes. The extent of fusion depended on the length of the peptides and the number and positions of covalently linked palmitic acids. Peptide-mediated fusion was suppressed by lysolipid and involved both outer and inner leaflets of the lipid bilayer, which is characteristic of natural membrane fusion.

Several proteins that are involved at different steps in the transport process, from the formation of a transport vesicle until its fusion with the target membrane, have been identified (3Pfeffer S.R.

For fusion to occur, transport vesicles with distinct v-SNAREs have to pair with cognate t-SNAREs at the appropriate target membrane. Syntaxin and SNAP-23/25 are members of the t-SNARE family of proteins, whereas synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein are v-SNARE proteins (3Pfeffer S.R. Nat.

Syntaxin, SNAP-25, and vesicle-associated membrane proteins mediate fusion through the formation of helical bundles that span opposing membranes. Hydrophobic C-terminal domains anchor syntaxin and vesicle-associated membrane proteins to the lipid bilayer of the plasma and vesicle membranes, respectively. The crystal structure of the SNARE complex has identified the regions of SNAP-25 that are involved in binary and ternary interactions (8Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.-K.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) possess cysteine residues clustered in a relatively unstructured segment between two helical domains. The cysteine residues in this segment are palmitoylated (12Veit M. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 13Lane S.R. Liu J. J.

Mutants of syndet and SNAP-25 lacking cysteines, and therefore not palmitoylated, are localized predominantly in the cytoplasm of transfected cells (15Koticha D.K. Huddleston S.J. Witkin J.W.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3197-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on mutagenesis of SNAP-25, a minimal plasma membrane-targeting domain composed of residues 85–120 has been identified. This segment has the ability to target green fluorescent protein to plasma membranes in transfected cells (17Gonzalo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21313-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). There have been reports which suggest that cysteines and consequently palmitoylation, are not essential for targeting of SNAP-25 to membranes, as membrane association is facilitated by syntaxin 1A (18Washbourne P. Cansino V. Mathews J.R. Graham M. Burgoyne R.D. Wilson M.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, recent reports suggest that membrane targeting of SNAP-25 is independent of interaction with syntaxin 1A and the cysteine-rich domain is necessary for function in intact cells (19Kotachia D.K. McCarthy E.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3341-3351PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the role of the proposed membrane targeting segment of the SNAP family of proteins in membrane assembly of the parent protein and its possible role in the fusion process, we have studied the interaction of synthetic peptides spanning the cysteine-rich region of SNAP-23, with and without covalently linked palmitic acids, with model and natural membranes. A schematic sketch showing the various domains of SNAP-23, the primary structure of the segment with the cysteine cluster in SNAP proteins from different species, and the synthetic peptides investigated in the present study are presented in Fig. 1,A and B. We observed that palmitoylation is essential for the peptides to cause membrane fusion. Our results also provide insights into dependence of membrane fusion on peptide length, position of cysteines, and extent of palmitoylation. Fmoc amino acids used in peptide syntheses were purchased from Advanced Chemtech (Louisville, KY). All phospholipids including those labeled with fluorescent tags were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Calcein was from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Peptides were synthesized manually using solid phase procedures and Fmoc chemistry. Cysteine sulfhydryl groups were blocked with acetamidomethyl group. The N termini of peptides were acetylated in a mixture of acetic anhydride/triethylamine/dimethyl formamide (0.1:0:0.02:1, v/v). Palmitoylation was carried out as described before (20Harishchandran A. Pallavi B. Nagaraj R. Protein Peptide Lett. 2002; 9: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, cysteine sulfhydryl groups of resin-bound peptides were deprotected using 5 eq of mercuric acetate (per cysteine) in dimethyl formamide for 1 h, followed by treatment with 50 eq of β-mercaptoethanol for another hour. The procedure was repeated three times to ensure complete removal of acetamidomethyl. On-resin palmitoylation of free –SH groups was carried out using palmitic acid activated withN-hydroxybenzoatriazole and 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate. Peptides were cleaved from the resin purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography/reverse phase fast performance liquid chromatography and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Expected mass was observed for the nonpalmitoylated and palmitoylated peptides. Stock solutions were made in trifluoroethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide. Peptide concentration was determined by monitoring absorbance at 280 nm. Lipid vesicles with compositions PC, PC:PE (1:1), PC:PE:SM:CL (1:1:1:1.5), and PC with 30 mol % cholesterol were prepared by the extrusion method or by sonication. Lipid stocks were diluted in chloroform to appropriate molar concentrations and dried to form a thin film. The lipid films were left under vacuum overnight to remove residual solvent and subsequently hydrated in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl. SUV were obtained by sonication of the lipid suspension. LUV were obtained by extrusion through polycarbonate filters of 100 nm pore size (21MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). For circular dichroism studies, peptide was added to lipid solution in chloroform and dried to form a mixed film. The film was hydrated and SUV were prepared by sonication. Resonance energy transfer between NBD-PE (energy donor) and Rho-PE (energy acceptor) was used to monitor membrane fusion (22Struck K.D. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4039-4099Crossref Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Two populations of liposomes were prepared, one labeled with 2 mol % each of NBD-PE and Rho-PE and the other unlabeled. The labeled and unlabeled vesicles were mixed at a ratio of 1:9 to a final concentration of 200 μm in 1.2 ml in 5 mm HEPES containing 150 mm NaCl. Peptides were added and after 5 min, fluorescence was recorded with excitation at 465 nm and emission set at 530 nm. The slit widths of the excitation and emission monochromators were 5 nm. Percent fusion was calculated using the equation (F −Fo)/(Ft −Fo) × 100, where Fo = fluorescence intensity before adding peptide, F = fluorescence intensity after adding peptide, and Ft= fluorescence intensity after complete dilution by detergent (Triton X-100). Fusion assays were done in the presence of 10 mmdithionite or lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (23Langosch D. Brosig B. Pipkorn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32016-32021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as follows. The labeled vesicles were incubated on ice for 1 h in the presence of 10 mm dithionite. Excess dithionite was removed by passing through Sephadex G-50 spin columns. To check the effect of LPC, 10 μg/ml LPC was added to the vesicles before recording the RET changes induced by the peptides. Three independent experiments were carried out. Peptides (5 μm) were titrated with increasing amounts of lipid vesicles. The tryptophan fluorescence was monitored with the excitation monochromator set at 280 nm, and the emission spectrum was recorded from 320 to 400 nm with 5-nm slit widths. All fluorescence measurements reported in this study were done in a F-4500 Hitachi fluorescence spectrometer. The accessibility of tryptophan to the aqueous quencher iodide in the presence of lipid vesicles was determined as follows. KI was added in increasing amounts from a 4 m stock containing 1 mm Na2S2O3. The data were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation,Fo/F = 1 +KSV[Q], where Foand F represent the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher [Q], respectively and KSV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant. Normalized accessibility factor was calculated from the ratios ofKSV at a lipid:peptide ratio of 50:1 and KSV for peptide in the absence of lipid. Spectra were recorded in a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter in water and also in SUV composed of PC:PE:SM:CL (1:1:1:1.5). Scanning was done in the wavelength range of 195 to 250 nm. Path length was 1 mm. Data are represented as mean residue ellipticity. Lipid films formed after drying in vacuum were hydrated in 70 mm calcein solution made in HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. SUV were prepared by sonication. Untrapped calcein was separated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-75 column in 5 mm HEPES containing 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Release of calcein on addition of peptides was monitored with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 520 nm. Percent release was calculated from the equation (F −Fo)/(Ft −Fo) × 100, where Fo and F are fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of peptides and Ft is the fluorescence intensity after adding Triton X-100. Granules and membranes were isolated as described by Nadin et al. (24Nadin C.Y. Rogers J. Tomlinson S. Edwardson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2801-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The precautions mentioned by Edwardson (25Edwardson J.M. Methods. 1998; 16: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were taken. Granules from a single pancreas were suspended in 500 μl of 5 mm MES containing 280 mm sucrose, pH 6.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of pepstatin, and 1 mm EDTA was also included. Protein was assayed by the Bradford method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Pancreatic membranes were prepared by method of Meldolesi et al. (27Meldolesi J. Jamieson J.D. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 49: 109-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). EDTA and pepstatin were included in the buffers during processing. Membranes were resuspended in 5 mm MES containing 280 mm sucrose, pH 6.5, and stored in aliquots at −20 °C at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. KCl-treated membranes were prepared by incubating the membranes in 0.5 m KCl for 30 min at 4 °C (25Edwardson J.M. Methods. 1998; 16: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Membranes were recovered by centrifugation at 70,000 × g for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in 0.5 m KCl and the recovery step was repeated. The membrane pellet was washed in sucrose/MES buffer and resuspended at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in the same buffer. Membrane fusion was assayed by the measurement of relief of self-quench of fluorescent probe R18 (28MacLean C.M. Law G.J. Edwardson J.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 1 μl of octadecylrhodamine (R18) from a 20 mm stock solution in ethanol was added to 300 μl of granule suspension and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Granules were collected by centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min and resuspended in the original volume. In the fusion assay, 5 μl of the granules (∼10 μg of protein) were resuspended in 600 μl of MES buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 280 mm sucrose. Fluorescence was recorded with excitation at 560 nm and emission at 590 nm. After equilibration for 3 min, the granules were challenged with target membranes (∼20 μg of protein). In the case of KCl-treated membranes, ∼30 μg of protein was used. Other components like peptides, Ca2+, and EGTA were added to the cuvette in accordance with the experimental requirement. Percent fusion was calculated considering the fusion induced by 1 mmCa2+ as 100%. Red blood cells were isolated from rat blood and resealed ghost membranes were prepared using the method described by Mobley et al. (29Mobley P.W. Lee H.F. Curtain C.C. Krikpatrick A. Waring A.J. Gordon L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Phospholipid concentration of the resealed ghosts was estimated by the Fiske-Subbarow method (30Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The ghost membranes were resuspended in incubation buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 120 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). Fresh preparations were used in all the experiments. Lipid mixing was analyzed by measuring dequenching of R18 (29Mobley P.W. Lee H.F. Curtain C.C. Krikpatrick A. Waring A.J. Gordon L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), by a procedure similar to the zymogen granule plasma membrane fusion assay. Resealed ghost membranes were incubated with R18 at a final concentration of 1 mol of R18/50 mol of red cell lipid for 30 min at room temperature. Unbound probe was removed by repelleting the ghosts at 22,000 ×g for 20 min and washed in the incubation buffer. For the assay 50 μm phospholipid containing labeled and unlabeled ghosts at a molar lipid ratio of 1:4 were taken in incubation buffer. Fluorescence was recorded for 3 min before the addition of peptides. Peptides were added and fluorescence changes were monitored as a function of time. Fluorescence intensity of intact R18-labeled red cell ghosts was 20–30% that of labeled ghosts treated with 0.1% Triton X-100. Percent fusion was calculated using the formula: 100 × ((F −Fo)/(Fmax −Fo)), where F, Fo, and Fmax are the fluorescence intensities before addition of peptide, after addition of peptide, and after complete dilution of the probe by addition of 1% Triton X-100. Peptides corresponding to 14 or 27 residues of the membrane-targeting domain of human SNAP-23 were synthesized by solid phase methods. Four of the five cysteines present in this domain are conserved in human SNAP-25. In 27P4, the nonconserved cysteine was replaced with phenylalanine, as observed in the sequence of human SNAP-25 (Fig. 1). To generate peptides with two palmitic acids, two cysteines were substituted with serines (27P2 and 14P2). In Sc27P4, the cysteines at positions 6 and 8 that are present in 27P4 were exchanged with the amino acids at positions 18 and 24, to spread out the cysteines and examine whether their clustering was important for activity. The amino acids after the cysteine cluster in 27P4 were also scrambled (Sp27P4) with a view to examine the role of this segment in membrane fusion. Palmitoylation was carried out with peptides attached to the resin after removal of the cysteine thiol protecting group. Cleavage from the resin yielded the palmitoylated peptides. In the 14-residue peptides, tryptophan was introduced at the N terminus to facilitate quantitation as well as to monitor interaction with lipids by fluorescence spectroscopy. The ability of peptides to fuse lipid vesicles of varying composition was examined by a fluorescence-dequenching assay (22Struck K.D. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4039-4099Crossref Scopus (1133) Google Scholar) that monitors lipid mixing. In this assay, NBD-PE and Rho-PE are present in “donor” liposomes and fluorescence of NBD is quenched as a result of energy transfer. When donor liposomes fuse with unlabeled “acceptor” liposomes, the average distance between the fluorophores increases, which results in an increase of NBD fluorescence. The ability of 27P4 to fuse SUV and LUV of varying lipid composition is shown in Fig.2A. Considerable fusion is observed with vesicles composed of PC:PE:SM:CL. LUV fused more effectively than SUV. Because maximum fusion was observed with PC:PE:SM:CL vesicles, the fusogenic ability of other peptides related to 27P4 was examined on SUV and LUV with this composition. The data shown in Fig. 2B indicate that 27P4 causes maximum fusion. 27P2 and 14P4 show similar extents of fusion, which is less than 27P4 but comparable with Sc27P4. The shorter peptide with two palmitic acids causes fusion to a considerably lower extent. The peptide Sp27P4 is marginally less effective in causing fusion at high peptide concentrations as compared with 27P4. However, the extent of fusion caused by Sp27P4 is more than the other peptides. The four palmitic acids clustered at the N terminus appear to significantly influence the fusogenic properties of the peptides. A peptide corresponding to a segment of the Sendai virus F1 protein (IKLTQHYFGLLTAFGSNGTIG) that has been demonstrated to induce fusion of lipid vesicles (31Peisajovich S.G. Samuel O. Shai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) is less efficient than 27P4 and Sp27P4 in causing fusion. Hemifusion is an intermediate state where the outer membrane leaflets mix to form a stalk structure (32Maukin V.S. Kozlou M.M. Boroujagin V.L. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 1984; 5: 361-377Google Scholar, 33Chernomordik L.V. Zimmerberg J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 34Chernomordik L.V. Chem. Phys.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 38Chernomordik L.V. Kozlou M.E. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Biological membrane fusion is presumed to proceed through this state. Lysolipids stabilize positive curvature upon integration in the outer leaflet because of their inverted cone geometry (38Chernomordik L.V. Kozlou M.E. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Because hemifusion is associated with curvature of the outer leaflet, lysolipids are inhibitory to fusion before membrane merger (37Chernomordik L.V. Vogel S.S. Sokoloff A. Onaran H.O. Leikina E.A. Zimmerberg J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We investigated whether peptide-mediated fusion involved a hemifusion intermediate, and the ability of the peptides to convert the hemifusion state to complete fusion wherein the inner leaflet lipids of the fusing membranes are also involved. The data presented in Fig.3A indicate reduction of fusion in the presence of LPC for all the five peptides that cause fusion. This suggests hemifusion as a possible step in the fusion process. To examine whether peptide-mediated fusion involved both membrane leaflets, liposomes where the fluorescence of NBD present in outer leaflet was quenched by dithionite treatment, were used in the fusion assay (39Hoekstra D. Duzgunes N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 220: 15-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A considerable amount of resonance energy transfer was observed even after the quenching of outer leaflet fluorescence by dithionite (Fig. 3B). This shows that the peptides induced lipid mixing in the inner leaflet along with the outer leaflet. The efficiency of the inner leaflet mixing by these peptides appears to be a little lower than the outer leaflet mixing. Because the fluorescence of Trp is sensitive to environment (40Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar), the fluorescence of Trp in synthetic peptides (described in Fig. 1) in the presence of lipid vesicles was monitored. All the peptides have a single Trp residue. It was observed that the nonpalmitoylated peptides when excited at 280 nm showed an emission maximum at 350 nm in buffer. Addition of lipid vesicles did not result in change in the fluorescence properties suggesting that the peptides do not bind to lipid vesicles. This observation is also consistent with the inability of these peptides to fuse lipid vesicles. Changes in fluorescence were observed when lipid vesicles were added to the palmitoylated peptides (Fig.4A). A linear increase inF/Fo was observed for 14P2 with various lipids. For 27P2, Sp27P4, and Sc27P4, theF/Fo plateaued at a lipid/peptide ratio of 20, whereas in 14P4 and 27P4, the plateau was observed at a ratio of 10. The data indicate that the tetrapalmitoylated peptides with clustered cysteines bind strongly to lipid vesicles irrespective of the nature of the head group. The accessibility of Trp to iodide was then examined. The data in Fig. 4B indicate that while Trp is solvent exposed in the nonpalmitoylated peptides, it is shielded for the aqueous quencher in the palmitoylated peptides. The Trp is relatively less accessible in the palmitoylated 27-residue peptides as compared with the 14-residue peptides. Despite difference in the fusogenic properties, the Trp location seems to be similar in 27P2, 27P4 and Sc27P4 and Sp27P4. The conformations of the peptides were examined in buffer and lipid vesicles (Fig.5). The palmitoylated peptides were not ordered in buffer and in the presence of lipid vesicles showed minima at ∼208 and 222 nm, which is characteristic of helical conformation (41Woody R.W. The Peptides. 7. Academic Press, New York1985: 15-115Google Scholar). The nonpalmitoylated peptides did not show ordered structure in buffer and lipid vesicles. These differences could arise as a result of the palmitoylated peptides binding to lipid vesicles and lipid-induced conformational changes in 27P2 and 27P4. Whether the fusion process is accompanied by leakage of vesicle contents was next examined. The data presented in Fig. 6A indicate that a maximum release of 40% was observed with 27P4. No further release was observed beyond a peptide/lipid ratio of 0.03. Release of calcein as a function of lipid composition was examined for 27P4 (Fig.6B). Unlike fusion, substantial release of calcein was also observed with PC vesicles. Calcein release was less pronounced in the presence of other palmitoylated peptides, which were less effective in causing fusion. However, concentrations of the peptides at which there was discernible calcein release were higher than the concentrations at which they induced leaflet mixing. The ability of the peptides to fuse membrane vesicles with plasma membranes in vitro was investigated using zymogen granules and pancreatic plasma membranes. Their fusogenicity has also been compared with that of Ca2+, which has been shown to stimulate fusion between zymogen granules and plasma membranes in vitro (25Edwardson J.M. Methods. 1998; 16: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 28MacLean C.M. Law G.J. Edwardson J.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig. 7A indicate that 27-residue peptides have the ability to fuse the granules to the plasma membrane. Ca2+ was more effective than the peptides in inducing fusion. The extent of fusion caused by 27P4 and Sp27P4 was similar. The shorter palmitoylated peptides as well as SV208 peptide did not cause fusion. When the extent of fusion was normalized with respect to Ca2+, 27P4 showed 50% fusion. Fusion by 27P4 was similar in the absence and presence of EGTA, indicating that peptide-mediated fusion was Ca2+-independent. The dependence of fusion on peptide concentration is shown in Fig.7B. 27P4 and Sp27P4 showed similar extents of fusion at various peptide concentrations used in the experiment. The relation between Ca2+ and peptide-mediated fusion was investigated (Fig. 8). Fusion mediated by Ca2+ was observed to be independent from peptide-mediated fusion. As shown in Fig. 8A, when fusion was initiated by peptide, addition of Ca2+ resulted in an increase the membrane mixing to an extent equal to that caused by Ca2+alone. But when fusion was initiated by Ca2+, no further increase in fusion was observed with the addition of peptides. A possible explanation for this observation could be that the Ca2+-induced lipid mixing is the maximum attainable for this system under the conditions of the study and therefore addition of peptides could not result in a further increase in the fusion. From the results shown in Fig. 8B, it was evident that Ca2+-mediated fusion was inhibited by EGTA, whereas addition of EGTA did not affect peptide-mediated fusion. Ca2+ was unable to increase lipid mixing in the presence of EGTA. Thus, peptide- and Ca2+-mediated fusion are independent events. To examine whether peripherally bound proteins are involved in the fusion process, the effect of KCl treatment on fusion was investigated. The data shown in Fig.9 indicate that salt wash abrogates Ca2+-mediated fusion but not fusion caused by peptides. This further confirms that Ca2+- and peptide-induced fusion are independent events.Figure 9Requirement of peripheral proteins on the plasma membrane for peptide-induced and Ca2+-induced fusion. A, fusion induced by the peptides, 27P2, 27P4, and Ca2+ prior to treatment of the plasma membrane with KCl. The concentrations of the peptides were 1 μm and that of Ca2+ and EGTA were 1 mm. B, fusion after treatment of plasma membranes with 0.5 n KCl. The amount of Ca2+, EGTA, and the peptides used was the same as in A. Control indicates the basal level of fusion between the zymogen granules and plasma membrane. Experimental conditions for R18 fluorescence measurements were the same as indicated in the legend to Fig. 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The fusogenic ability of synthetic peptides on other membrane systems like red blood cell ghost membranes was investigated. The data shown in Fig. 10 indicate that the palmitoylated 27-residue peptides also cause fusion of red blood cell ghost membranes. In this system, the SV208 peptide also causes fusion, although to a lower extent. The fusion events in eukaryotic cells are orchestrated events, which are finely tuned by interaction with various proteins of the SNARE family (1Rothman J.E.

SNAP-23/25, a crucial player in the fusion process (8Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.-K. Bennet M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar) is a fairly hydrophilic protein but membrane-associated. The protein does not have equivalents of “fusion peptide segments” that exist in viral fusion proteins (42Han X. Tamm L.K. Biosci. Rep. 2000; 20: 501-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, it has multiple cysteine residues, which are proximal to each other in a central domain. Continuous stretches of cysteines are present in cysteine string proteins, which are known to be involved in exocytosis (43Gundersen C.B. Mastrogiacomo A. Faull K. Umbach J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19197-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of these cysteines are palmitoylated. In cysteine string proteins, the cysteines and hence palmitoylation could be essential for membrane targeting (43Gundersen C.B. Mastrogiacomo A. Faull K. Umbach J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19197-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The role of cysteines and palmitoylation in the SNAP family proteins with respect to membrane attachment and fusion is yet to be clearly elucidated. We have investigated the membrane binding and the ability of peptides corresponding to the cysteine-containing SNAP segment to cause fusion of natural and model membranes. Our studies indicate that palmitoylation is necessary for binding to lipid vesicles. In the shorter 14-residue peptide, four covalently linked palmitic acids are essential for fusion. The 27-residue peptide where the four cysteines are clustered (27P4) caused maximum fusion. When the amino acids after the cysteine cluster were scrambled, there was a slight decrease in the extent of fusion of model membranes but not natural membranes. The peptide Sc27P4 with relatively evenly spaced out cysteines was less effective in causing fusion and the efficiency was comparable with that of 27P2 where only two palmitic acids are present at the N terminus. Hence, it appears that four palmitic acids linked to a cluster of cysteines is an important determinant for perturbation of the lipid layer so as to promote vesicle fusion. All the acylated fusogenic peptides in this study fused vesicles that had the lipid composition PC:PE:SM:CL with a higher efficiency compared with lipid vesicles of other compositions. This observation could be relevant as there are reports that SNAREs might be clustered in sphingolipid cholesterol rafts in polarized apical sorting (45Lafont F. Verkade P. Galli T. Wimmer C. Louvard D. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3734-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 46Lang T. Bruns D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). This lipid composition is also very close to natural synaptic vesicle membrane composition and the model membranes composed of these four lipids have been shown to exhibit optimized fusogenic capabilities (47Haque M.E. McIntosh T.J. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4340-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The fusion process appears to proceed via a transient hemifusion state as evident from sensitivity to lysolipid. Fusion also involves both bilayer leaflets as indicated by bleaching of NBD in the outer leaflet by dithionite. However, unlike fusion caused by peptide mimics of SNARE (48Langosch D. Crane J.M. Brosig B. Hellwig A. Tamm L.K. Reed J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and vesicular stomatitis virus-G protein transmembrane segments (23Langosch D. Brosig B. Pipkorn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32016-32021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), Ca2+ does not potentiate the fusogenic property of 27P4. Even in the case of fusion of zymogen granules to plasma membranes, the process appears to be independent of Ca2+ and also independent of peripheral membrane proteins. Although proteins play crucial roles in the regulation of biomembrane fusion, the process requires coming together and coalescence of lipid bilayers. The role of lipids in membrane fusion has been addressed (49Siegel D.P. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2124-2140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 50Hebn C.A. Israelachvili J.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 220: 130-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 51Burger K.N.J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Defects in membrane lipid packing are necessary for interaction between the hydrophilic regions of the bilayers. The 27- or 14-residue peptides are not intrinsically hydrophobic and are quite different from viral fusion peptides (42Han X. Tamm L.K. Biosci. Rep. 2000; 20: 501-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). They do not associate with lipid vesicles in the absence of palmitoylation. Even on palmitoylation, the peptide chain does not appear to span the lipid bilayer. Despite these differences, the fusion process seems to follow the steps proposed in the Stalk hypothesis (32Maukin V.S. Kozlou M.M. Boroujagin V.L. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 1984; 5: 361-377Google Scholar, 33Chernomordik L.V. Zimmerberg J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 34Chernomordik L.V. Chem. Phys.

A direct role for SNARE proteins in membrane fusion has emerged from studies where isolated SNARE proteins have been reconstituted in model membranes. Formation of SNARE complexes has been shown to be essential for this fusion (52Nickel W. Weber T. McNew J.A. Parliti F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, the SNARE protein domains other than those involved in ternary complex formation have been implicated to be important for fusion (48Langosch D. Crane J.M. Brosig B. Hellwig A. Tamm L.K. Reed J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of SNAP-25 in neurites and PC 12 cells is dynamically regulated and the degree of palmitoylation influences membrane binding (13Lane S.R. Liu J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that palmitoylated and nonpalmitoylated peptides exhibit distinctive differences in membrane-binding properties and ability to promote fusion of membranes. It is therefore possible that the palmitoylation status of the cysteine cluster of SNAP proteins could play a crucial role in regulating membrane fusion in cells. We thank Dr. M.

They bind to more than 120 different proteins and play a role in the regulation of many cellular processes, including signaling, cell cycle control, apoptosis, exocytosis, cytoskeletal rearrangements, transcription, and regulation of enzymes. Although the exact function of the 14-3-3 proteins is still not completely understood, three main mechanisms seem to be important. First, 14-3-3 proteins positively or negatively regulate the activity of enzymes; second, 14-3-3 proteins may act as localization anchors, controlling the subcellular localization of proteins; and third, 14-3-3 proteins can function as adaptor molecules or scaffolds, thus stimulating protein-protein interactions. Binding motifs have been identified in a number of proteins that bind to the 14-3-3 proteins. Many of these binding motifs consist of a phosphorylated serine residue, flanked by a proline and arginine residue (7Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S.

Open table in a new tab Nucleic acid manipulations were performed by standard techniques. The QIAprep mini spin kit (Qiagen) was used to isolate plasmid DNA from E. coli. The same kit was used to purify plasmid DNA from S. cerevisiae, after yeast cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml lyticase in buffer P1 (Qiagen) for 30 min. Subsequently, the isolated plasmid DNA was amplified inE. coli XLI-blue. Library Y2HL (22James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consisting of 0.5–3-kb fragments of genomic DNA fused to the GAL4ad, was a gift of Philip James. Strain HF7c was first transformed (23Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar) with pRUL551 and subsequently with 50 μg of each of the libraries Y2HL-C1, Y2HL-C2, and Y2HL-C3. Transformants with an activated HIS3reporter were selected on MY medium supplemented with adenine (20 μg/ml), lysine (30 μg/ml), and 20 mm 3-aminotriazole and subsequently assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Library plasmids were isolated from His+β-galactosidase+ transformants by amplification inE. coli after selection for ampicillin resistance. His6-tagged recombinant Bmh1p and Bmh2p were purified from E. coli XLI containing pRUL526 and pRUL527, respectively. Cells were grown to anA620 of 0.25 in TB supplemented with ampicillin. After addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, the cells were grown for an additional 2.5 h to an A620 of 0.82. Two grams (wet weight) of cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 15 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 300 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 10 μg/ml RNase A, and 10 μg/ml DNase I and incubated for 30 min at 0 °C. Then Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the cells were incubated on ice for an additional 10 min. The lysate was cleared by two centrifugation steps at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. One ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose suspension (Qiagen) was added to the lysate, and after a 90-min incubation at 4 °C under continuous stirring the mixture was poured into a column. The column was washed with 100 ml of 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, at 20 ml/h, followed by washing with 55 ml of Buffer B (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). The His6-tagged proteins were eluted with a 40-ml 0–500 mm gradient of imidazole in Buffer B. Fractions containing the purified His6-Bmh1p or His6-Bmh2p were dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 50% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford analysis (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 7: 72248-72254Google Scholar), and purity was estimated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie and silver staining. The purified proteins were stored at −80 °C. S. cerevisiae strain GG3100 was grown in 500 ml of MY medium to anA620 of 0.8. Cells were harvested, washed, and cultured for 16 h in 500 ml of MYZ medium supplemented with 1% galactose to induce the expression of the recombinant protein. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet (3.8 g) was vortexed with 4 g of glass beads (600 μm; Sigma) in 40 ml of lysis buffer (8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 mm ε-aminocaproic acid, 1 μg/ml E-64, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotonin, and 1 mmNa3VO4. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g, and the pH of the clear supernatant was adjusted to 8.0 with NaOH. The extract was incubated with 500 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 16 h at room temperature. All washing and elution steps were performed in spin columns. The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was washed six times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer, 10 times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, and single times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 20, 30, and 40 mm imidazole. His6-Fin1p was eluted with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 400 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol at 4 °C. Alternatively, the protein was stored at −20 °C in the 8 murea-containing elution buffer. The protein concentration was determined with the Bradford assay, and purity was estimated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Microtiter plates (Flow Laboratories) were coated overnight at 4 °C with varying amounts of purified His6-Fin1p or cytochrome c(Sigma) in 50 μl of PBS (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). After washing with 200 μl of PBS, the wells were blocked with 200 μl of 1% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in PBS for 90 min at room temperature. When desired, bound Fin1p was dephosphorylated by incubation with 100 units of λ protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) in 100 μl of λ protein phosphatase buffer for 60 min at 30 °C. Controls contained heat-inactivated protein phosphatase (10 min at 100 °C in the presence of 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). After five washes with 200 μl of PBST (PBS, 0.5% blocking reagent, 0.05% Tween 20), the wells were incubated with 50 μl of PBS containing the indicated amounts of purified His6-Bmh1p or His6-Bmh2p for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed five times with 200 μl of PBST, and 100 μl of anti-Bmh1 antiserum (13van Heusden G.P.H. Griffiths D.J. Ford J.C. Chin A.W.-T. Schrader P.A. Carr A.M. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (1:2000) in PBST was added followed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature. After washing with PBST, goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Promega) and nitrophenylphosphate were used to detect bound antiserum. Bound Fin1p was detected by a similar procedure except that anti-RGSH4 antibody (Qiagen) and anti-mouse/rabbit IgG-peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used. Surface plasmon resonance analysis was done with a BIAcore-3000. 2000 resonance units of Fin1p were coupled to a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore) by theN-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (NHS/EDC) method (25Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Fin1p was dialyzed against 2.5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 25 mmNaCl. The reference channel was made by activating and deactivating the surface without coupling a protein. Measurements were done in HBS buffer (BIAcore) at 25 °C at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Each run consisted of an association step of 5 min using either His6-Bmh1p or His6-Bmh2p dissolved in HBS, followed by a dissociation step with HBS buffer. Between runs the chip was regenerated with 10 mm glycine, pH 10. Analysis of kinetic data was performed with the BIAevaluate 3.0 software (BIAcore) using the 1:1 (Langmuir) binding fitting model. Simulations with experimentally found kinetic parameters were done with BIAsim (BIAcore) and Clamp software (26Myszka D.G. Morton T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 149-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were cultured in MY medium, and exponentially growing cells were analyzed using a Zeiss Axiovert 135 TV microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany), equipped with a 100-watt mercury lamp and a ×100/NA 1.30 Plan Neofluar phase objective. YFP was detected with a filter set consisting of a 500/20-nm bandpass filter, a 515-nm dichroic mirror, and a 535/30-bandpass emission filter. For FRET images the emission filter of the YFP filter set was used in combination with the CFP excitation filter and dichroic mirror. CFP was detected with a filter set consisting of a 436/20-nm bandpass excitation filter, a 455-nm dichroic mirror, and a 480/20-nm bandpass emission filter (all from Chroma Technologies). Images were acquired using a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments), in the sequence YFP-, FRET-, and CFP-image (27Hailey D.W. Davis T.N. Muller E.G.D. Methods Enzymol. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). Typical exposure times were 0.2 s. The set of three images was corrected for background and, when necessary, for pixel shift. Overlap from the CFP and YFP into the FRET image was corrected at each pixel. Images were further processed with in-house software. For calculation of relative FRET values the formula, FRETC = (IFRET − a *ICFP − b *IYFP)/ICFP, essentially as described (28Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), was used, where FRETC is the corrected FRET value, and IFRET,ICFP, and IYFP are intensities measured through FRET, CFP, and YFP filter sets, respectively. a and b are bleed-through percentages measured in cells only expressing CFP or YFP. Calculated FRETC values are displayed in pseudocolor. To identify binding partners of the yeast 14-3-3 protein Bmh2 we made use of the two-hybrid system. To facilitate analysis of positive clones, we constructed “bait” and “prey” vectors with a different selection marker. Therefore, we replaced the ampicillin resistance marker of bait vectors pGBD-C1, pGBD-C2, and pGBD-C3 (22James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by the kanamycin resistance marker. Then, we constructed plasmid pRUL551 encoding a fusion between Bmh2p and Gal4bd. This construct was able to complement a lethal bmh1 bmh2 disruption, indicating that the fusion protein has retained (at least) its essential 14-3-3 function (data not shown). pRUL551 alone already activated theHIS3 reporter of HF7c, but this could be suppressed by addition of 20 mm 3-aminotriazole. Of 22 × 106 transformants, five had both an active HIS3and β-galactosidase reporter. We isolated plasmids from the His+β-galactosidase+ transformants, and after transformation of E. coli, colonies were selected on medium supplemented with ampicillin. None of these E. coli colonies contained the bait plasmid pRUL551. In two other two-hybrid screens using bait plasmids with a kanamycin marker we did not isolate the bait plasmid either (data not shown), indicating the power of the use of different selection markers in the bait and prey plasmids. Cotransformation of HF7c with each of the five isolated library plasmids and pRUL551 resulted again in His+ transformants with β-galactosidase activity. Cotransformation of HF7c with the isolated library plasmids and the empty vector pGBDK-C1 yielded His− transformants without β-galactosidase activity. This demonstrates that the activation of the reporter genes of HF7c in these five positives is dependent on the presence of both pRUL551 and the library plasmid. Sequencing of the yeast DNA insert of one of the isolated plasmids revealed an in-frame fusion between theGAL4ad and the 3′-end of GCR2, encoding amino acids 223 to 534 of the Gcr2 protein. GCR2 encodes a transcription factor required for full activation of glycolytic genes. Three other plasmids contain SPT21. However, forSPT21 there is not an in-frame fusion with theGAL4 activating domain. The last plasmid contains an in-frame fusion between the GAL4ad and YDR130c, lacking the first 30 base pairs. As the protein encoded by this open reading frame forms cell cycle-specific filaments, we named this open reading frame FIN1 (filaments in between nuclei 1) (1van Hemert M.J. Lamers G.E.M. Klein D.C.G. Oosterkamp T.H. Steensma H.Y. van Heusden G.P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5390-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The reverse combination,BMH2 fused to the GAL4ad and FIN1fused to GAL4bd, also reacts positively in the two-hybrid system (data not shown). We studied the interaction between Fin1p and the yeast 14-3-3 proteins in more detail. To confirm the interaction between the 14-3-3 proteins and Fin1p found in the two-hybrid system, we used a sandwich ELISA with purified proteins. To this end we isolated recombinant His6-tagged Bmh1 and Bmh2 proteins from E. coliand His6-tagged Fin1p from yeast (see “Materials and Methods”). Various amounts of purified Fin1p (0–200 ng) were immobilized to the wells of a microtiter plate. After"
https://openalex.org/W2021392425,"Death receptors belong to the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. They can induce apoptosis following engagement with specific ligands and are known to play an important role in the regulation of the immune system. Here we report that epoxycyclohexenone (ECH) inhibits apoptosis induced by anti-Fas antibody, Fas ligand (FasL), or tumor necrosis factor-α but not by staurosporine, MG-132, C2-ceramide, or UV irradiation. These results suggest that ECH specifically blocks death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Neither the surface expression of Fas nor the Fas-FasL interaction was influenced by ECH. However, ECH did block the activation of pro-caspase-8 in the death-inducing signaling complex, although recruitment of Fas-associating death domain (FADD) and pro-caspase-8 was not affected. ECH inhibited the enzymatic activity of recombinant active caspase-8 at slightly lower concentrations than it did for active caspase-3 and active caspase-9 in vitro. However, in FasL-treated cells, ECH was only able to inhibit the activation of pro-caspase-8, and it had no effect on the already activated caspase-8 at a concentration that is effective at inhibiting Fas-induced apoptosis. ECH directly bound the large subunit of active caspase-8 that contains the active center cysteine and had a relatively higher affinity to pro-caspase-8. Moreover, compared with pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-9, pro-caspase-8 was predominantly depleted by biotinylated ECH with avidin beads in the cell lysates, suggesting that ECH preferentially affects pro-caspase-8. Thus, our results suggest that ECH blocks the self-activation of pro-caspase-8 in the death-inducing signaling complex and thus selectively inhibits death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Death receptors belong to the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. They can induce apoptosis following engagement with specific ligands and are known to play an important role in the regulation of the immune system.

Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Google Scholar, 2Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Google Scholar). Fas (CD95, Apo-1) is a well characterized member of the death receptor family that contains an extracellular cysteine-rich motif and a cytoplasmic death domain that is essential for transmission of the death signal (3Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Google Scholar, 4Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Google Scholar). Stimulation of Fas with its cognate Fas ligand (FasL) leads to a clustering of Fas molecules that induces the recruitment of the adaptor protein FADD via a homophilic death domain interaction (5Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Google Scholar). The death effector domain of FADD, in turn, interacts with the death effector domain of pro-caspase-8 (6Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar), resulting in the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (7Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Google Scholar). Following DISC formation, pro-caspase-8 is proteolytically processed, resulting in the formation of an active dimer (8Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Google Scholar). Subsequently, activated caspase-8 cleaves downstream substrates such as effector caspases and initiates the apoptotic cascade that ultimately leads to cell death. In Fas-mediated apoptosis, two types of cells are proposed to transmit distinct death signals (9Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Google Scholar, 10Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22532-22538Google Scholar). In type I cells, such as SKW6.4, the level of activation of pro-caspase-8 initiated at the DISC is sufficient to cleave pro-caspase-3 directly. However, in type II cells, such as Jurkat, less pro-caspase-8 is activated, and the mitochondrial pathway is required to amplify the weak death signal. The small amount of activated caspase-8 is able to cleave Bid efficiently, the truncated form of which translocates to mitochondria and induces the release of cytochrome c. Released cytochrome c then forms a complex called the “apoptosome” that contains Apaf-1 and pro-caspase-9, and it is this complex that generates active caspase-9 that subsequently cleaves and activates pro-caspase-3. The Fas signaling pathway is a complex process that is regulated by cellular and viral proteins such as FLICE inhibitory proteins (FLIPs) (11Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K.

Functional and structural analyses of these regulators have contributed to our understanding of the molecular basis of Fas-mediated apoptosis. However, several non-peptide small molecules that modulate apoptosis also have been reported (15Arakaki N. Kajihara T. Arakaki R. Ohnishi T. Kazi J.A. Nakashima H. Daikuhara Y. J. Biol.

These molecules are useful for dissecting the apoptosis signal transduction pathway and also may be potential candidates for therapeutic use. To find specific inhibitors of Fas-mediated apoptosis, we have screened a library of microbial secondary metabolites and identified epoxycyclohexenone (ECH). Previously, it was reported that ECH inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis, although the inhibitory mechanism of ECH remains obscure (22.Kanbayashi, K., Kamikakiuchi, T., and Horibe, I. (August 1999) Japan Kokai Patent H11-222456.Google Scholar). In this study, we show that ECH selectively inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis by preventing the activation of pro-caspase-8 in the DISC. Human T lymphoma Jurkat cells and Burkitt's lymphoma SKW6.4 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Each medium was supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (JRH Bioscience, Lenexa, KS), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). TNF-α was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). C2-ceramide was purchased from Sigma. Staurosporine was purified as reported in our previous study (23Osada H. Takahashi H. Tsunoda K. Kusakabe H. Isono K. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1990; 43: 163-167Google Scholar). MG-132 and zVAD-fmk were obtained from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Agonistic anti-human Fas IgM antibody CH-11 and anti-caspase-8 antibody were obtained from Medical & Biological Laboratories Co. Ltd. (Nagoya, Japan). Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and anti-α-tubulin antibody were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Fas (B-10), anti-caspase-3, anti-Bid, and anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-cytochrome c antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-FADD antibody was from Pharmingen. Anti-IκB antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). ECH was isolated from the culture broth of a producing fungal strain using bioassay-guided purification procedures. Biotinylated ECH was synthesized by a coupling reaction using an activated biotin reagent (Pierce). The structures of ECH and biotinylated ECH were determined by their physico-chemical properties, detailed 1H- and 13C-NMR analyses including two-dimensional techniques, and mass spectroscopies. The details of these procedures and characterization will be reported elsewhere. FLAG-tagged FasL was prepared as reported previously (24Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The extracellular domain of human FasL (amino acids 128–281) was amplified by PCR from a Jurkat cDNA library using a 5′-forward primer containing a ClaI site (5′-ATCGATGGAGAAGCAAATAGGCCACCCC-3′) and a 3′-reverse primer containing an XbaI site (5′-TCTAGATTAGAGCTTATATAAGCCG-3′) and cloned into a modified version of pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with the preprotrypsin secretion signal peptide and FLAG epitope. The pcDNA3-FLAG-FasL vector was transiently transfected into HEK293T cells using the calcium phosphate method and incubated for 72 h. Culture supernatants were centrifuged to remove cell debris. The amount of FLAG-tagged FasL in the culture supernatants was determined by the cytotoxic activity as compared with purified FLAG-tagged FasL as a standard. FLAG-tagged FasL was cross-linked with 500 ng/ml anti-FLAG M2 antibody. The cross-linked FasL was used in experiments to induce apoptosis. Jurkat cells or SKW6.4 cells (5 × 104 cells, 100 μl) were cultured with apoptosis inducers for 8 h in 96-well microtiter plates prior to treatment with 500 μg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) for 2 h. MTT-formazan was solubilized in 5% SDS overnight, and the absorbance at 595 nm was measured using a plate reader (Wallac 1420 ARVOsx; Amersham Biosciences). Cell viability (percent) was calculated as (experimental absorbance − background absorbance)/(control absorbance − background absorbance) × 100. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, the protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Diagnostics)). The cytosolic fractions (50 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and probed with specific antibodies. The proteins were visualized using the ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). To measure the expression level of Fas on the cell surface, Jurkat cells were treated with anti-Fas antibody (B-10) for 45 min on ice, washed with PBS, and then treated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min on ice. The cells were washed with PBS, and the surface expression of Fas was detected by flow cytometry (Profile II; Coulter Co., Hialeah, FL). The Fas-FasL interaction was measured as follows: Jurkat cells were treated with FLAG-tagged FasL and anti-FLAG M2 antibody for 60 min, washed with PBS, and chilled on ice. The cells were treated subsequently with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 45 min on ice. The cells were washed with PBS, and surface binding of FasL was assessed by flow cytometry. SKW6.4 cells were treated with 2 μg/ml FLAG-tagged FasL in the presence of anti-FLAG M2 antibody (2 μg/ml) for the indicated times. In the negative control, anti-FLAG M2 antibody was added after lysis. Following incubation, the cells were rapidly cooled down by the addition of 5 volumes of ice-cold PBS and then lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mmNaF, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, the protease inhibitor mixture). Cytosolic fractions were precleared with Sepharose 6B (Sigma) for 60 min and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h. Sepharose beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer. Proteins were separated using 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) followed by Western blotting using anti-caspase-8 and anti-FADD antibodies. Fas clustering was visualized as described previously (25Algeciras-Schimnich A. Shen L. Barnhart B.C. Murmann A.E. Burkhardt J.K. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 207-220Google Scholar). In brief, SKW6.4 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml FLAG-tagged FasL and 1 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 antibody for 30 min on ice and washed with PBS to remove unbound FasL. The cells were stained with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min on ice and washed with PBS. The cells were then warmed up and kept at 37 °C for 30 min to trigger Fas stimulation. After stimulation, the cells were adhered to glass slides precoated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and fixed in acetone-methanol (1:1). The glass slides were washed with PBS, mounted, and observed under fluorescence microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) The full-length human pro-caspase-8 was amplified by PCR from a Jurkat cDNA library using a 5′-forward primer containing a NheI site (5′-GCTAGCATGGACTTCAGCAGAAATC-3′) and a 3′-reverse primer containing anXbaI site (5′-TCTAGATTAATCAGAAGGGAAGAC-3′) and cloned into pCI-neo vector (Promega, Madison, WI), designated pCI-caspase-8. The extracellular and transmembrane domain of human Fas (amino acids 1–184) was amplified by PCR from a Jurkat cDNA library using a 5′-forward primer containing a NheI site (5′-GCTAGCATGCTGGGCATCTGGACCCTC-3′) and a 3′-reverse primer containing an EcoRI site (5′-GAATTCTCTGCATGTTTTCTGTACTTCC-3′) and cloned into the pCI-caspase-8 vector digested with NheI andEcoRI. Recombinant human active caspase-3, -8, or -9 were mixed with Ac-DEVD-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (MCA), Ac-IETD-MCA, or Ac-LEHD-MCA, respectively (Peptide Institute Inc.) in reaction buffer (20 mm PIPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA) for 60 min. The release of 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin (AMC) was measured by a plate reader using an excitation filter (360 nm) and an emission filter (460 nm). A DNA fragment of full-length human caspase-8 was amplified by PCR from a Jurkat cDNA library using a 5′-forward primer containing a BamHI site (5′-GGATCCGATGGACTTCAGCAGAAATC-3′) and a 3′-reverse primer containing a HindIII site (5′-AAGCTTTCAATCAGAAGGGAAGAC-3′) and cloned into the pRSET-C vector (Invitrogen) containing an N-terminal His6 tag, designated pRSET-caspase-8. Cell lysates were prepared from anEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain harboring pRSET-caspase-8 following induction with isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The His6 tag-tagged pro-caspase-8 was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and desalted with the PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the in vitro binding assay, recombinant pro-caspase-8 (800 ng) and active caspase-8 (800 ng) were pretreated in the presence or the absence of 500 μmECH for 1 h as the competitor in the reaction buffer and then treated with various concentrations of biotinylated ECH for 2 h on ice. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting using anti-caspase-8 antibody and avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Pierce). For the in situ binding assay, HEK293T cells transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged pro-caspase-8 or SKW6.4 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, the protease inhibitor mixture). The cell lysates (500 μg) were treated with 20 μmbiotinylated ECH for 1 h on ice and then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody or anti-caspase-8 antibody together with protein A-agarose for 4 h. The agarose beads were then washed four times with the lysis buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting using anti-caspase-8 antibody or anti-FLAG M2 antibody. The amount of biotinylated ECH bound to pro-caspase-8 was detected by avidin-conjugated HRP. Human Burkitt's lymphoma SKW6.4 cells are classified as type I, in which Fas ligation is able to trigger sufficient activation of pro-caspase-8 to induce the direct activation of pro-caspase-3. In contrast, human T lymphoma Jurkat cells are classified as type II since, due to weak activation of pro-caspase-8, activation of pro-caspase-3 requires amplification via the mitochondrial pathway. To obtain specific inhibitors of Fas-mediated apoptosis, we screened a library of microbial metabolites and identified ECH as a compound that will inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Agonistic anti-Fas antibody CH-11 and cross-linked FasL are both able to induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1 A). We found that ECH inhibited the apoptosis induced by CH-11 or FasL at equivalent concentrations and did not decrease cell viability under these conditions (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were obtained with SKW6.4 cells that underwent apoptosis upon treatment with CH-11 or FasL (Fig. 1, C and D). Both Jurkat and SKW6.4 cells treated with CH-11 or FasL showed cell body shrinkage and chromatin condensation, and this was also reduced by ECH (Fig.1 E). Clonogenic assays revealed that ECH increases the survival rates of FasL-treated SKW6.4 cells, although ECH alone had little effect on cell proliferation in long term cultures (Fig.1 F). Jurkat cells are highly sensitive to a variety of apoptotic stimuli. In addition to Fas-mediated apoptosis, we examined the inhibitory effects of ECH on various apoptotic pathways induced by TNF-α, staurosporine (a protein kinase inhibitor), MG-132 (a proteasome inhibitor), C2-ceramide (a cell-permeable analogue of ceramide), and UV irradiation. All apoptosis inducers tested caused cell death in Jurkat cells within 8 h and reduced the cell viability. As observed with Fas-mediated apoptosis (Fig.1 B), ECH markedly inhibited apoptosis induced by TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). In contrast, ECH did not significantly block apoptosis induced by staurosporine, MG-132, C2-ceramide, or UV irradiation (Fig. 2 A). A pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, was able to prevent apoptosis irrespective of the inducer used (data not shown). These results suggest that in contrast to zVAD-fmk, ECH blocks death receptor-mediated apoptosis selectively. Upon ligand binding, death receptors such as TNF receptor 1 initiate two distinct signals: the caspase-8-dependent death signal and the survival signal that activates transcription factor NF-κB (26Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Google Scholar). The degradation of IκB is a prerequisite event for NF-κB activation (27Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine whether ECH has an effect on the survival signal activated by TNF-α, we monitored the cellular levels of IκB. We observed degradation of IκB within 15 min of TNF-α stimulation in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2 B). A proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, inhibited such TNF-α-induced IκB degradation; however, in ECH cells, degradation was still observed (Fig.2 B). These data indicate that ECH blocks the TNF-α-induced death signal but had no effect on the survival signal. To investigate the molecular target of ECH during the inhibition of Fas-mediated apoptosis, we first examined whether ECH treatment decreases the expression level of cell surface Fas. Jurkat cells were pretreated with ECH and then treated with anti-Fas antibody (B-10). Following assessment by flow cytometry, we concluded that ECH did not produce observable changes in the level of cell surface Fas (Fig. 3 A). We then examined whether ECH disrupts the Fas-FasL interaction. For this, Jurkat cells were pretreated with ECH and incubated with cross-linked FasL followed by staining with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Equal amounts of cell surface FasL binding were detected in both the control and ECH-treated cells, suggesting that ECH did not affect the interaction between Fas and FasL (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, to determine which step of the Fas-mediated apoptosis is blocked by ECH, caspase-dependent cleavage of proapoptotic molecules was assessed by Western blot analysis. CH-11, FasL, and TNF-α induced the cleavage of pro-caspase-8 into intermediate cleaved forms, which leads to triggering of the downstream cascade such as the cleavage of Bid, the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, the cleavage of pro-caspase-3, and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, a substrate of active caspase-3 (Fig.3 C). ECH blocked the self-cleavage of pro-caspase-8, and thus, the downstream events were all suppressed. Treatment with staurosporine, MG-132, C2-ceramide, and UV irradiation also triggered the apoptotic cascade; however, ECH did not affect all events under these conditions. These results were consistent with the observations made above (Fig. 2 A), which demonstrated that ECH was not able to inhibit death receptor-independent apoptosis. In contrast, the pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, was able to block all of the steps initiated by any of the apoptotic stimuli tested. These results suggest that ECH targets an early signaling event(s) upstream of pro-caspase-8 activation in the apoptosis pathways via the Fas and TNF receptor. The engagement of FasL with Fas initiates the recruitment of FADD and pro-caspase-8 to Fas, enabling formation of the DISC. Immediately following DISC formation, pro-caspase-8 is placed in a configuration that facilitates self-processing, resulting in the generation of its active form. In SKW6.4 cells, both FADD and pro-caspase-8 were rapidly recruited to Fas upon treatment with FasL, and pro-caspase-8 was processed to yield the intermediate cleaved form, p43 (Fig.4 A). Although the recruitment of FADD and pro-caspase-8 to Fas was observed to be unaffected in ECH-treated cells, the self-processing of pro-caspase-8 was markedly blocked in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A). DISC formation reached a maximum at 15 min and was reduced after 60 min (Fig. 4 B). However, in ECH-treated cells, the DISC remained stable for 60 min without any processing of pro-caspase-8 (Fig.4 B). These results suggest that ECH blocks self-processing of pro-caspase-8 after its recruitment to FADD. Next we investigated whether or not ECH inhibited Fas clustering. Under non-stimulatory conditions, Fas was distributed equally on the cell surface (Fig. 4 C, panel b). FasL engagement triggered the formation of Fas clustering at the cell surface (Fig. 4 C, panel d). However, ECH markedly reduced this clustering (Fig. 4 C, panel f), as did the pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk (Fig. 4 C,panel h). Therefore, these observations support the idea that ECH blocks the self-processing of pro-caspase-8 during Fas-mediated apoptosis. The above observations suggest that the primary target of ECH in Fas-mediated apoptosis may be the self-processing of pro-caspase-8 following its binding to FADD. To support this hypothesis, we constructed a Fas-caspase-8 fusion protein (Fas-casp8) consisting of the caspase-8 catalytic domain (amino acids 180–479) and the Fas extracellular and transmembrane domains (amino acids 1–184) (Fig.5 A). The assay system can detect directly that cross-linked FasL induces FADD-independent activation of pro-caspase-8. Although transfection of Fas-casp8 in HEK293T cells slightly induced caspase-8 activity, exogenous addition of FasL strongly enhanced the activity. ECH significantly suppressed the proteolytic activity of caspase-8 in Fas-casp8-transfected cells (Fig. 5 B). Under the same conditions, self-processing of Fas-casp8 was monitored by Western blot analysis. ECH markedly suppressed the appearance of the cleaved form of Fas-casp8 (Fig.5 C). These results support the notion that ECH targets self-activation of pro-caspase-8 in the DISC. We examined the direct effect of ECH on recombinant active caspase-8. ECH inhibited the enzymatic activity of active caspase-8 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 A). Unexpectedly, ECH also inhibited recombinant active caspase-3 and recombinant active caspase-9 (Fig. 6, B and C). The IC50value of active caspase-8 (24 μm) was slightly lower than that of active caspase-3 (50 μm) and active caspase-9 (62 μm); however, the IC50 difference might be insufficient to explain the selectivity of ECH in the cell-based assay. Thus, we examined the effect of ECH on pro-caspase-8 and active caspase-8 in intact cells. Jurkat cells were preincubated with FasL for 60 min (during which time caspase-8 activity steadily increases) and then treated with ECH or zVAD-fmk. ECH inhibited further activation of pro-caspase-8 but did not affect the already activated caspase-8 (Fig.6 D). In contrast, zVAD-fmk reduced caspase-8 activity to background levels, thus demonstrating that zVAD-fmk is able to inhibit both pro-caspase-8 and active caspase-8. Therefore, these results suggest that ECH inhibits the activation of pro-caspase-8 but does not affect active caspase-8 in intact cells. To compare the binding capacity of ECH with pro-caspase-8 and active caspase-8, we synthesized a biotin-labeled form of ECH (Fig.7 A). The biotinylated ECH bound to both the recombinant pro-caspase-8 and the recombinant caspase-8 large subunit (p18) that contains the active site cysteine. However, pro-caspase-8 had a relatively higher affinity to ECH than did caspase-8 p18 (Fig. 7 B). A competition assay using non-labeled ECH showed that the binding of ECH to pro-caspase-8 and caspase-8 p18 is specific. We then examined whether ECH is able to bind to pro-caspase-8 in crude cell lysates. For this, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged pro-caspase-8. The cell lysates were treated with biotinylated ECH and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody to pull down FLAG-tagged pro-caspase-8. FLAG-tagged pro-caspase-8 was clearly detected by avidin-HRP (Fig. 7 C). In addition, endogenous pro-caspase-8 was also detectable by avidin-HRP after immunoprecipitation with anti-caspase-8 antibody from cell lysates of SKW6.4 cells (Fig.7 D). To examine the selectivity of ECH on each pro-caspase, we performed a depletion analysis by using biotinylated ECH and avidin beads in the cell lysates. The depletion efficiency of pro-caspase-8 was more than 10-fold higher as compared with that of pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-9 (Fig. 7 E), suggesting that ECH preferentially affects pro-caspase-8 in intact cells. Pro-caspase-8 is a member of the cysteine protease family, which possesses a cysteine residue at its active center. Therefore, it is possible that ECH attacks the cysteine residue of pro-caspase-8. In agreement with this hypothesis, addition of glutathione or cysteine, but not serine, attenuated the binding activity of ECH on pro-caspase-8 (Fig. 7 F). Bioprobes are low molecular weight chemical inhibitors that can be used for the functional analysis of complex cellular processes (28Osada H. Osada H. Bioprobes. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2000: 1-13Google Scholar). To date, various bioprobes that are able to modulate apoptosis have been reported (21Bando M. Miyake Y. Shiina M. Wachi M. Nagai K. Kataoka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 268-274Google Scholar, 29Machida K. Hayashi Y. Osada H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31243-31248Google Scholar). Caspase substrate-mimicking peptide inhibitors have been most frequently used to block apoptosis. Radical scavengers such as N-acetylcysteine and metalloporphyrin can protect against apoptosis induced by reactive oxygen species (15Arakaki N. Kajihara T. Arakaki R. Ohnishi T. Kazi J.A. Nakashima H. Daikuhara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13541-13546Google Scholar, 16Patel M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1068-1074Google Scholar, 17Hildeman D.A. Mitchell T. Teague T.K. Henson P. Day B.J. Kappler J. Marrack P.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 735-744Google Scholar). Isatin sulfonamide derivatives directly inhibit effector caspases such as active caspase-3 and active caspase-7 and are able to block apoptosis induced by cycloheximide or camptothecin (18Lee D. Long S.A. Adams J.L. Chan G. Vaidya K.S. Francis T.A. Kikly K. Winkler J.D. Sung C.M. Debouck C. Richardson S. Levy M.A. DeWolf Jr., W.E. Keller P.M. Tomaszek T. Head M.S. Ryan M.D. Haltiwanger R.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16007-16014Google Scholar). It has been reported that protein kinase C activators, such as phorbol esters, suppress Fas-mediated apoptosis via blocking the oligomerization of Fas and recruitment of FADD and pro-caspase-8 into the DISC (19Ruiz-Ruiz C. Robledo G. Font J. Izquierdo M. Lopez-Rivas A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4737-4746Google Scholar, 20Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44944-44952Google Scholar). In this report, we show that ECH inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis by blocking the activation of pro-caspase-8. Since ECH is structurally different from the apoptosis modulators thus far reported, ECH is a novel type of non-peptide apoptosis inhibitor. ECH inhibited Fas-mediated apoptosis in all of the cell lines tested, such as Jurkat, SKW6.4, Raji, U937, and HepG2 cells (Fig. 1 and data not shown). The inhibitory effect of ECH was highly selective for death receptor-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 2). Consistent with these observations, ECH blocked the activation of pro-caspase-8, which is the specific initiator caspase for death receptor-mediated apoptosis (6Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar). Activation of pro-caspase-8 is known to be the first step in the cascade of apoptosis events induced by Fas stimulation. Upon FasL binding, pro-caspase-8 is recruited to the DISC multiprotein complex. The recruited pro-caspase-8 associates with the cytoplasmic portion of the Fas receptor via the adaptor protein FADD. In the DISC, pro-caspase-8 is proteolytically auto-processed to the active form (7Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Google Scholar,8Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Google Scholar). In ECH-treated cells, although recruitment of FADD and pro-caspase-8 was unaffected, the self-processing of pro-caspase-8 was blocked (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that the molecular target of ECH is part of the DISC component. As shown in Fig.3, A and B, ECH affected neither Fas expression nor Fas-FasL interaction. Therefore, FADD and pro-caspase-8 were both possible candidates as target molecules for the action of ECH. To clarify this issue, we constructed a Fas-casp8 fusion protein, which allows caspase-8 to be activated without the involvement of FADD, by the addition of cross-linked FasL as described previously (30Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Google Scholar). ECH blocked the FADD-independent caspase-8 activation (Fig. 5), indicating that the inhibitory target of ECH is pro-caspase-8 rather than FADD. This is consistent with the observation that ECH suppressed Fas clustering, which was reported previously to be a caspase-8-dependent event (25Algeciras-Schimnich A. Shen L. Barnhart B.C. Murmann A.E. Burkhardt J.K. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 207-220Google Scholar). ECH inhibited the enzymatic activity of recombinant active caspase-8 at a slightly lower concentration than its inhibition of recombinant active caspase-3 and caspase-9 (Fig. 6, A–C). However, ECH was not able to block apoptosis mediated by active caspase-3 and active caspase-9 in cells treated with chemical drugs and UV irradiation (Figs. 2 A and 3 C). Similar results have been reported in the case of zVAD-fmk (31Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Google Scholar, 32Sun X.M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5053-5060Google Scholar). To resolve this discrepancy, we examined whether ECH inhibits active caspase-8 in FasL-treated cells. In contrast to the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, ECH inhibited activation of pro-caspase-8 but did not inhibit the activity of already active caspase-8 (Fig. 6 D). Binding analysis revealed that ECH preferentially bound recombinant pro-caspase-8 rather than the large subunit of recombinant active caspase-8 (Fig. 7 B). Moreover, ECH bound pro-caspase-8 in the cell lysates (Fig. 7,C and D), and pro-caspase-8 was more efficiently depleted from these lysates as compared with pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-9 (Fig. 7 E). These results indicate that ECH possesses a higher affinity to pro-caspase-8 than to active caspase-8, pro-caspase-3, or pro-caspase-9 and that it inactivates the intrinsic proteolytic activity of pro-caspase-8. It may also be possible that the cellular amount of pro-caspase-8 is less than that of pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-9 and that the total pool of pro-caspase-8 in the cell is predominantly inactivated by ECH. ECH has a molecular structure of α, β-unsaturated ketone and epoxide that are highly reactive to addition of nucleophiles. Therefore, ECH may act by binding to the thiol group of cysteine residues within the active site of pro-caspase-8. Consistent with this hypothesis, the addition of either glutathione or cysteine was able to attenuate the binding of ECH on pro-caspase-8 (Fig. 7 F). Thus, we conclude that ECH is able to bind to cysteine residues possibly within the active center of pro-caspase-8 and thereby inhibits the self-activation of pro-caspase-8 in the DISC. Death receptor-mediated apoptosis has important functions for the homeostasis of the immune system and immune surveillance. Such functions include the elimination of harmful cells by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and the maturational selection of T- and B-lymphocytes. Consequently, derailment of death receptor-mediated apoptosis leads to severe diseases. For therapeutic use, the peptide-based caspase inhibitors including zVAD-fmk are first generation drugs, and a number of studies describe their potency in reducing cell death in acute situations of fulminant hepatitis, ischemia, and bacterial meningitis (33Rodriguez I. Matsuura K. Ody C. Nagata S. Vassalli P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2067-2072Google Scholar, 34Cheng Y. Deshmukh M. D'Costa A. Demaro J.A. Gidday J.M. Shah A. Sun Y. Jacquin M.F. Johnson E.M.

These caspase inhibitors may also be useful in reducing cell death in organs awaiting transplant (36Schierle G.S. Hansson O. Leist M. Nicotera P. Widner H. Brundin P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 97-100Google Scholar) and in reducing apoptosis of normal cells caused by chemotherapeutic drugs for cancer treatment. As a potential pharmacological drug, ECH has important characteristics. It is highly selective for death receptor-mediated apoptosis, it is a membrane-permeable non-peptide compound, and it is a small molecule that promises easy modification. Recently, death receptor-independent activation of pro-caspase-8 in neuronal diseases such as Huntington diseases has been reported (37Sanchez I. Xu C.J. Juo P. Kakizaka A. Blenis J. Yuan J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 623-633Google Scholar, 38Gervais F.G. Singaraja R. Xanthoudakis S. Gutekunst C.A. Leavitt B.R. Metzler M. Hackam A.S. Tam J. Vaillancourt J.P. Houtzager V. Rasper D.M. Roy S. Hayden M.R. Nicholson D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 95-105Google Scholar). In such diseases, expansion of polyglutamine repeats induces unfavorable protein aggregation that eventually recruits pro-caspase-8 and activates apoptosis independently of death receptors, resulting in neuronal cell death. Consistent with this model, the caspase-8 inhibitory proteins, CrmA and c-FLIP, as well as the dominant-negative mutant of FADD, prevent neuronal cell death (37Sanchez I. Xu C.J. Juo P. Kakizaka A. Blenis J. Yuan J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 623-633Google Scholar, 38Gervais F.G. Singaraja R. Xanthoudakis S. Gutekunst C.A. Leavitt B.R. Metzler M. Hackam A.S. Tam J. Vaillancourt J.P. Houtzager V. Rasper D.M. Roy S. Hayden M.R. Nicholson D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 95-105Google Scholar). Therefore, ECH, a novel non-peptide inhibitor preventing the activation of pro-caspase-8, could be a good candidate for therapeutic use to treat such neuronal diseases. We thank Y. Ichikawa and R.

To determine whether this novel action of LXRα has global implications on gene regulation, we employed expression profiling to identify other genes regulated by this unique mechanism. Here we report the existence of a set of known and unknown transcripts regulated in parallel with renin. Querying the Celera Mouse Genome Assembly revealed that a majority of these genes contained the consensus CNRE. We have confirmed the functionality of these CNREs by competition for LXRα binding via electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and by the use of CNRE decoy molecules documenting the abolishment of the cAMP-mediated gene induction. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the interaction between cAMP-activated LXRα and the CNRE enhancer element is responsible for widespread changes in gene expression and identify a set of LXRα/cAMP-regulated genes that may have important biological implications.

Dev. 1998; 8: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The best known mechanism of LXRα-mediated transcriptional activation occurs through interactions with compounds such as oxysterols (22-cho) or retinoic acid (9cRA) and results in heterodimerization to other transcription factors including retinoid X receptor α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (3Yoshikawa T. Shimano H. Amemiya-Kudo M. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H. Matsuzaka T. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Kimura S. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. Mol. Cell.

Transcription of target genes such as the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene occurs through a classical DR4/LXRE (5′-GGTTTAAATAAGTTCA-3′) response element (4Akiyama T.E. Sakai S. Lambert G. Nicol C.J.

The aspartyl protease renin is synthesized in the kidney and secreted into the plasma. It is the rate-limiting enzyme in angiotensin biosynthesis and thus plays an important role in blood pressure and volume regulation. Renin gene expression and secretion are mediated in part by intracellular levels of cAMP in kidney juxtaglomerular (JG) cells (5Baxter J.D. Duncan K. Chu W. James M.N. Russell R.B. Haidar M.A. DeNoto F.M. Hsueh W. Reudelhuber T.L. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1991; 47: 211-257PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we have identified a cAMP-responsive element distinct from the classical cAMP-responsive element in the promoter region of the mouse renin gene and have termed this element CNRE (5′-TACCTAACTTGGCTCACAGGCAGAATTTATC-3′) (6Burt D.W. Nakamura N. Kelley P. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7357-7362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homologues of this element found at positions −619 to −588 of the mouseRen-1D gene have been found in the mouseRen-1C and Ren-2 genes as well as in the rat and human renin genes (7Horiuchi M. Nakamura N. Tang S.S. Barrett G. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16247-16254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, using a yeast one-hybrid screening approach, we demonstrated that LXRα bound to this sequence, whereas functional studies using promoter/reporter gene chimeric constructs revealed that LXRα increased basal levels of renin expression and mediated the cAMP-dependent induction of mouse and human renin gene expression (8Tamura K. Chen Y.E. Horiuchi M. Chen Q. Daviet L. Yang Z. Lopez-Ilasaca M. Mu H. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8513-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the previously reported LXRα ligands such as 22-cho had no effect on renin gene expression nor on the expression of renin gene promoter/reporter gene chimeric constructs. Moreover, the studies conducted with N-terminal deletion mutants of LXRα indicated that the binding mechanism and positive regulation of these genes through the CNRE element uniquely occurred as a monomer in contrast to the action at the classical LXRα/DR4 element. Further studies revealed that the c-myc gene, which also contains the CNRE element, was similarly regulated (9Hay N. Takimoto M. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The discovery of LXRα as a regulator of renin gene expression by a previously unknown mechanism lead to the global question as to whether a set of genes exists that could be regulated in response to cAMP by LXRα. To address this question, we performed expression profiling of a mouse kidney JG cell line (8Tamura K. Chen Y.E. Horiuchi M. Chen Q. Daviet L. Yang Z. Lopez-Ilasaca M. Mu H. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8513-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) stably transduced with green fluorescent protein (10Hager G.L. Lim C.S. Elbi C. Baumann C.T. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or murine LXRα plus GFP and treated with cAMP or vehicle. The mouse renin-expressing cell line, As4.1 (ATCC CRL2193), was previously isolated from the kidneys of transgenic animals harboring a chimeric renin gene promoter/SV40 T-antigen construct (11Sigmund C.D. Okuyama K. Ingelfinger J. Jones C.A. Mullins J.J. Kane C. Kim U. Wu C.Z. Kenny L. Rustum Y. Dzau V.J. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19916-19922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Stable cell lines infected with a bicistronic retroviral construct expressing either GFP alone or GFP plus mouse LXRα were generated as described previously (12Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Morishita R. Zhang L. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1230-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For cAMP stimulation, cells were first made quiescent in DMEM containing 0.1% fetal calf serum for 12 h. Fresh medium was added containing DMEM + 0.1% fetal calf serum plus either vehicle (PBS) or 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP and incubated for various lengths of time. Total cell RNA was harvested using the TriZOL reagent and was assessed for quality by spectrophotometric and electrophoretic analysis. The cDNA microarrays generated in our laboratory consisted of 19,064 elements that included 2,432 cDNAs from three mouse libraries donated by colleagues at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (neonatal kidney and brain library from David Beier and nucleated erythroid cell library from C. C. Liew). Genes and ESTs were identified using sequence comparison of the mouse Unigene EST data base. An additional 15,264 cDNA clones derived from the NIA15k mouse developmental set were spotted, resulting in a total of 18,296 cDNA clones available for expression analysis (13Tanaka T.S. Jaradat S.A. Lim M.K. Kargul G.J. Wang X. Grahovac M.J. Pantano S. Sano Y. Piao Y. Nagaraja R. Doi H. Wood III, W.H. Becker K.G. Ko M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9127-9132Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). For use in the determination of nonspecific hybridization, cDNAs corresponding to several bacterial genes were also spotted in various regions of the array for a total of 768 control elements, thus resulting in the generation of a 19,064-element cDNA array. Amplified cDNA inserts were obtained from purified plasmid DNA templates, λ-phage clones, or directly from bacteria-harboring plasmids containing cDNA inserts. Purified plasmids were amplified using T7 (5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and T3 (5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′) or SP6 (5′-ATTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′) primers with the cycling parameters of 94 °C for 1 min, 37 °C for 1 min, and 73 °C for 1 min, 30 s for 40 cycles with an additional extension cycle of 73 °C for 8 min. Libraries consisting of bacteria or phage received an initial incubation cycle of 94 °C for 5 min before entering the previously mentioned cycling parameters. Amplified clones were analyzed for single band product by agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR products were purified by ethanol precipitation in 96-well format as described previously (14Harrington C.A. Rosenow C. Retief J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Purified inserts were spotted in linear format at 250 μm center-to-center distance on CMT-GAPS (Corning, NY) slides using the GMS417 Arrayer (Affymetrix). Total RNA (70 μg) was used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cDNA probes by a single round of oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription in the presence of either Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP. First strand cDNA derived from RNA extracted from As4.1 cells that were transduced with the GFP retrovirus and treated with vehicle was used as reference cDNA in all of the experiments and was labeled with Cy3, whereas cDNA derived from RNA isolated from cells treated with cAMP and/or transduced with LXRα was labeled with Cy5. The labeled probes were purified using G50 spin columns (Amersham Biosciences), combined, and resuspended in a hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide and hybridized to the array in the presence of blocking DNAs (mouse cot-1 genomic DNA, oligo(dA), tRNA) for 16 h at 42 °C under a coverslip. After hybridization, slides were washed in 1% SSC plus 0.1% SDS to remove the coverslip and remove non-hybridized probe and then washed sequentially in 0.5% SSC followed by 0.1% SSC. The slides were dried by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 2 min and were immediately scanned, and Cy3/Cy5 signal intensities were measured using a GMS418 Scanner (Affymetrix). The intensities Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence of each spot were measured by overlaying a quantitation grid over the scanned image (ScanAlyze). Local background was subtracted from the overall spot intensity in both channels. Nonspecific cross-hybridization signal was also determined. Signals from each bacterial clone were measured, and the values were averaged and subtracted from the murine cDNA spots within that subarray. Spots that did not meet a value >1.5 × background in either channel at all of the experimental time points were flagged or excluded. Calculated pixel-by-pixel correlation coefficients (Ch1GTB2 and Ch2GTB2) for Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent intensities in each spot were used to determine overall spot quality, and spots that contained values of <0.6 in both channels were also flagged or excluded. For total array conditional comparisons, ratios (Cy5/Cy3) for each slide were calculated, and to account for differences in overall hybridization and labeling efficiencies, ratios were log2-transformed and median-centered. The resulting data were then normalized using a lowest-fit intensity-dependent algorithm and subjected to significance filtering software (www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/terry/zarray/html/matt.html) based on observed versus expected values (15Deleted in proof.Google Scholar, 16Baldi P. Long A.D. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). All of the conditions were combined in one large data set, and hierarchical clustering using Pearson-centered correlative and complete linkage-clustering algorithms were then employed to generate a tree containing gene expression clusters with similar temporal expression profiles in all of the conditions using GeneSpring Software, version 4.13 (SI Genetics). A subset of genes was then obtained, which contained an expression profile similar to mouse renin for subsequent analysis. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR was employed for validation as follows. Gene-specific primers were generated based on the known EST sequence. SpliceView and ExonPCR programs were utilized to generate primers that had a high probability of spanning an intron (17Pertea M.

Genomics. 1998; 47: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Primers specific for 18 S RNA (forward 5′-CGG CTA CAT CCA AGG AA-3′; reverse 5′-GCT GGA ATT ACC GCG GCT-3′) were added as an internal positive control. Template RNA (500 ng), gene-specific primers (20 pm), 18 S RNA primers (20 pm), and oligo(dT) (500 ng) were added to a RT-PCR kit (Amersham Biosciences), and reactions were subjected to low cycle PCR as follows: first strand synthesis (1 cycle of 60 °C for 30 min and 94 °C for 2 min), amplification (18–25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min), and extension cycle (1 cycle of 72 °C for 5 min). Aliquots of the resultant products (5 μl) were subjected to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis for further analysis. All of the RT-PCR experiments were conducted in triplicate using at least three separate RNA samples. A stock solution (150 μm) of complementary phosphorothiate-modified single-stranded oligomers (Invitrogen) was incubated at 65 °C for 10 min and allowed to anneal at 25 °C for 2 h in annealing buffer (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water). For experiments, annealed oligomers were diluted to various concentrations using annealing buffer, whereas excess stock was stored at −20 °C for future use. Assessment of decoy transduction efficiency was conducted as previously reported with some adjustments (19Morishita R. Gibbons G.H. Horiuchi M. Ellison K.E. Nakama M. Zhang L. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T.

After 48 h, detection of positively transduced cells was conducted by fluorescent microscopy using a conventional fluorescein detection filter. Untransduced cells and phase-contrast microscopy were utilized as a control. For assessment of decoy effect on target gene transcription, As 4.1 cells containing either GFP or LXRα were transduced with 40 μm non-FITC labeled decoy as previously mentioned. After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS and then grown in serum-reduced media (DMEM + 0.1% FBS) for 12 h. Fresh growth medium then was added containing 0.1% FBS (Invitrogen) and either 1 mm8-Br-cAMP or PBS (vehicle) and allowed to incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for a period of 6 h. After treatment, total RNA was isolated using TriZOL (Invitrogen) and an aliquot was subjected to quality assessment by spectrophometric and agarose gel analysis. EMSA assays were performed as described previously with some modifications (7Horiuchi M. Nakamura N. Tang S.S. Barrett G. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16247-16254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As4.1 cells were serum-restricted and treated with 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP or vehicle as described previously. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared using the NuclearPrep Kit (Pierce), and protein concentration was assessed by spectrophotometric assay. Nuclear extracts were then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C for future use. For competition experiments, 10 μg of extract from As4.1/LXRα was incubated with 1.75 pmγ-32P-labeled probe containing theren-1D CNRE sequence (5′-CTA ACT TGG TCT CAC AGG CTA GAA-3′) and 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe containing the CNRE and flanking 6-bp sequences from each identified gene. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed in 1× Tris borate EDTA buffer for 2 h at 200 V. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to autoradiography film overnight at −80 °C. For antibody neutralization assays, the reaction was carried out as described previously; however, after incubation with lysate, reactions were further incubated with anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), anti-LXRα (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), or gel shift buffer for an additional 15 min. The novel action of LXRα in the regulation of renin and c-myc genes leads us to ask whether other genes are regulated in a similar manner. To address this issue, we initiated a cDNA-based transcript profiling study. A mouse cDNA microarray was generated that contained a total of 19,064 spotted elements. Table I indicates the results of querying the cDNA sequences against the Unigene data base (build number 88), which revealed that 6,446 (35.2%) cDNAs matched to known genes and 5,990 (32.7%) matched to other reported ESTs, resulting in a total of 12,436 (67.9%) previously reported sequences. An additional 5,910 (32.3%) were unable to be matched and thus were considered novel. Additionally, 768 (4.2%) bacterial control spots were distributed throughout the array as control elements for normalization.Table IEST distribution of spotted clones on mouse arrayIn house clones Number of ESTs matched to known genes2,426 Number of ESTs matched to other ESTs in Unigene data base460 Number of ESTs unmatched to other libraries (novel)146NIA 15k set Number of ESTs matched to known genes4,020 Number of ESTs matched to other ESTs in Unigene data base5,530 Number of ESTs unmatched to other libraries (novel)5,714 Total number of spotted ESTs18,296 Number of bacterial controls768 Total number of clones spotted on mouse cDNA array19,064Sequences from the in-house clones or from the NIA 15k clone set were blasted against the Unigene data base (Build number 88) to generate a distribution based on match to known genes or other ESTs.

Serum-restricted mouse kidney juxtaglomerular cells (As4.1) stably transduced with either GFP plus mLXRα (As4.1/LXRα) or GFP (As4.1/GFP) were treated with either 8-Br-cAMP or PBS (vehicle) for 1–24 h (1, 6, 12, or 24 h). Total RNA was used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cDNA probes by a single round of oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription in the presence of either Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP. Standard background subtraction and normalization protocols were then employed, and clustering analysis was performed (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the greatest amount of differential gene expression occurred in cells expressing LXRα in the presence of cAMP when compared with all other conditions and thus demonstrate our previous observations of LXRα as a cAMP-responsive transcription factor. We next asked whether there existed a subset of genes with an expression pattern similar to that observed for renin. Utilizing the temporal expression profile of mouseRen-1D where expression peaks at 6 h (Fig.2, A and B) to query the entire set of expressed genes with a correlation coefficient cutoff of ≥0.92, a subset of genes was then obtained for subsequent cluster analysis (Fig. 3, Aand B). Table II indicates a list of 41 genes that exhibit an increase in transcriptional activity peaking at 6 h. The gene descriptions in this table suggest that LXRα is able to modulate the expression of genes with diverse functional properties. These results indicate that at 6 h, LXRα+cAMP is able to induce the expression of these genes with an observed range of induction of 3.4–51.7-fold with 38 (92.6%) genes at a p ≤ 0.05 and a subset of 24(58.5%) genes at ap ≤ 0.01 when compared with all other conditions. The average fold induction (Fig. 3D) in LXRα+ cAMP-treated cells at the 6-h time point was 8.4-fold higher when compared with all other conditions.Figure 3Hierarchical cluster of genes that exhibit a renin expression profile. Hierarchical clustering (A) of genes that exhibit a highly similar (correlation ≥0.92) temporal expression profile to mouse renin (B andC) was done using a Pearson centered correlation coefficient distance metric (separation ratio = 0.9; minimum distance = 0.001).

Open table in a new tab The entire list of expressed genes (11,529) were queried using the temporal expression profile of mouse renin (Ren-1d) and resulted in the identification of 41 genes, which displayed a profile similar to that of renin (correlation ≥0.92). Gene function annotation is derived from GeneSpring and is based on Gene Ontology consortium classification. We next asked whether these genes identified, by virtue of having an expression profile similar to renin, contained a CNRE element. The EST sequences corresponding to each of the 41 genes were compared with the Celera Mouse Genome Assembly to obtain the surrounding genomic sequence for each gene. 50 kilobases of flanking sequence was queried for the presence of the consensus CNRE element (5′-TNN(T/G)TC(C/T)CA(C/G)AGG-3′). Because most of the ESTs to be queried are not matched to known genes and are thus considered novel, a 50-kilobase distance was utilized to ensure the probability of analyzing a promoter region. The 5′ end of the EST sequence was used as an “anchor,” and all consensus CNRE hits are reported in terms of the distance to their respective anchors. The results of this search indicated 16 genes (TableIII) that contain a consensus CNRE within 50 kilobases of the anchor. The total number of genes could further be divided into groups that contain CNRE elements within a short (0–15 kb, 7 genes), moderate (16–30 kb, 9 genes), and long distance (31–50 kb, 7 genes) from the anchor sequence.Table IIIList of genes with Celera™ database identified CNRE elementUsing the Celera data base 50-kb, of flanking sequence were queried for the presence of the consensus CNRE element.

The upstream region of the 41 EST sequences were used as an “anchor” and resulted in 16 genes that contained a consensus CNRE within a 50-kb upstream region.

A comparison of the CNRE sequences to mouse Ren-1d CNRE resulted in an identity range of 61.5–84.6%. RT-PCR assays were conducted to validate the temporal expression profile results by using EST-specific primers generated with a high possibly of spanning an intron using splice prediction software (SpliceView and ExonPCR). An internal control set of primers generated to amplify 18 S RNA was added to each reaction to account for initial template concentration, and all of the amplification reactions were conducted under low cycle number conditions. The results from these experiments (Fig. 4) indicate 15 out of 16 genes that contained a CNRE validated by a marked increase in amplified product present in cells transduced with LXRα and treated with cAMP when compared with cells treated with vehicle or cells transduced with GFP and/or treated cAMP for a period of 6 h. To determine whether the temporal expression profile exhibited by the identified genes was the result of LXRα directly modulating transcription levels through binding a CNRE enhancer element within the promoter region or through some other indirect mechanism, we employed a decoy strategy. Double-stranded decoy molecules that correspond to the CNRE element present in the mouse renin (Ren-1d) promoter were generated to determine whether this decoy would be able to “sequester” endogenous LXRα and hence suppress target gene inducibility. Control double-stranded DNA representing decoy to the classical cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) enhancer sequence and a scrambled DNA containing the CNRE nucleotides were utilized to assess specificity of the results. FITC-labeled decoy was used to analyze the transduction efficiency in As4.1 cells. Various concentrations (0–100 μm) of DNA molecules were utilized to determine an optimal concentration that would yield high transduction efficiency with low cytotoxicity. Efficiency was assessed by the percentage of positive nuclei under a fluorescent microscope after 24 h. The results indicated 40 μm to be sufficient for 100% cellular transduction with no visible cytotoxicity. Fig. 5 indicates that all three DNA molecules exhibited a similar efficiency when employed at 40 μm. No visible fluorescence was observed in cells that were mock-transduced. As.4.1 cells transduced"
https://openalex.org/W1992744933,"Proteins destined for the mitochondrial matrix space have leader sequences that are typically present at the most N-terminal end of the nuclear-encoded precursor protein. The leaders are rich in positive charges and usually deficient of negative charges. This observation led to the acid-chain hypothesis to explain how the leader sequences interact with negatively charged receptor proteins. Here we show using both chimeric leaders and one from isopropyl malate synthase that possesses a negative charge that the leader need not be at the very N terminus of the precursor. Experiments were performed with modified non-functioning leader sequences fused to either the native or a non-functioning leader of aldehyde dehydrogenase so that an internal leader sequence could exist. The internal leader is sufficient for the import of the modified precursor protein. It appears that this leader still needs to form an amphipathic helix just like the normal N-terminal leaders do. This internal leader could function even if the most N-terminal portion contained negative charges in the first 7–11 residues. If the first 11 residues were deleted from isopropyl malate synthase, the resulting protein was imported more successfully than the native protein. It appears that precursors that carry negatively charged leaders use an internal signal sequence to compensate for the non-functional segment at the most N-terminal portion of the protein.

Most proteins found in the mitochondrial matrix space are encoded by nuclear genes and are synthesized on cytosolic polysomes.

Acta. 2002; 1592: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A common feature of leader sequences is the frequent occurrence of basic residues, particularly arginine, a residue that is found three times more often in the leaders than proteins (6Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because TOM proteins are negatively charged, an acid-chain hypothesis was developed to suggest that positive charges in the leader sequences are necessary for TOM to interact with negatively charged receptor proteins (7Schatz G. Nature. 1997; 388: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).The leader sequence for pALDH has been studied extensively in our laboratory. As shown in Fig. 1, the leader is composed of 19 amino acids that can be induced into a helix-linker-helix amphiphilic structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol or detergent micelles (8Karslake C. Piotto M.E. Pak Y.K. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9872-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although each helical segment contains an equal number of positive charges, the N-terminal helical segment has been shown to be necessary to efficiently target the leader to the matrix space (9Wang Y. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4759-4765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If both of the arginines of the N-helical segment are substituted with glutamine, the ability to be imported is essentially eliminated, showing that the net positive charge in the N-helical segment is more important than the total positive charge throughout the leader (6Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Deletion of the linker results in a non-processable leader that is longer in helical content (10Thornton K. Wang Y. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19906-19914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is more capable of importing ALDH than is the native sequence in a cell-free import assay (6Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The enhanced stability of the linker-deleted leader has been used successfully to study structural aspects as a compensating factor for the loss of positive charges resulting from arginine to glutamine mutational substitutions. The linker-deleted structure can import a “passenger” protein even if both of the N-terminal arginine residues (Arg-3 and Arg-10) are mutated to glutamines (6Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the basis of the positive charge versus structural compensation model developed from our previous studies, glutamic and aspartic acid residues were systematically introduced into the pALDH leader to ascertain how negative charges may be tolerated. It was observed that when serine was replaced with glutamic acid, the S7E mutant pALDH was imported to an extent similar to pALDH; however, the R3Q,S7E double mutant was poorly imported (11Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29389-29393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This result implies that only a net positive charge was required for the proper import of a precursor into the matrix. Although negatively charged amino acids typically are not found in leader sequences, chaperonin 10 (12Hartman D.J. Hoogenraad N.J. Condron R. Hoj P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3394-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and rhodanese (13Miller D.M. Delgado R. Chirgwin J.M. Hardies S.C. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4686-4691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) each contain one negative charge. Different forms of yeast IPMS (coded byLeu4 and Leu9) contain one and two negative charges, respectively, in their leader sequences (14Beltzer J.P. Morris S.R. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol.

Mitochondrial IPMS provided us with a good model to study the mechanism of import of a natural protein with negative charges within the mitochondrial leader sequence.In this study, we used several chimeric and mutant forms of pALDH and IPMS containing neutral or negative charges in their leader sequences. We will show that some precursors could be imported to the mitochondrial matrix with a leader sequence that is not present at the most N-terminal portion.DISCUSSIONDuring the past decade much has been learned about the leader sequences of precursor proteins that are destined for the mitochondrial matrix space (3Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 27von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). No reports exist, however, to explain how a leader that does not possess a net positive charge at its N terminus is imported. During our studies with the positive charge in the ALDH leader, we often found that if the leader was made more helical it would compensate for the removal of positive charges (6Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). No actual structure for a precursor protein that possesses a cleavable leader sequence has been determined. NMR has been used to show that a number of peptides corresponding to leader sequences can indeed form α helices when bound to micelles or when in a hydrophobic environment (6Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,8Karslake C. Piotto M.E. Pak Y.K. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G.

Recently the structure of the aldehyde dehydrogenase leader bound to TOM20 was shown to be helical, supporting the notion that helicity is indispensable for its function (29Muto T. Obita T. Abe Y. Shodai T. Endo T. Kohda D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).A few precursor proteins do not possess positive charges in what could be considered to be the classical N-terminal leader sequence. For example, the non-processed precursors rhodanese (30Waltner M. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26311-26317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and chaperonin10 (31Ryan M.T. Hoogenraad N.J. Hoj P.B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1323-1331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have no positive charges in the first eight residues and actually have a negative charge in the leader. Leu4 leader has one lysine residue but two negative charges in its first 11 residues. These leader peptides were all found to be helical, consistent with our notion that structure can somehow overcome positive charge deficiency. Even if structure could overcome this situation, it is not apparent how the TOM complex, which contains patches of negative charges (7Schatz G. Nature. 1997; 388: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), can recognize the atypical leader.We took advantage of the two-leader strategy that we used previously to investigate the processing of leader peptides by MPP (18Mukhopadhyay A. Hammen P. Waltner-Law M. Weiner H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1026-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here a modified non-functional leader was fused to the N termini of a native or modified precursor protein. In this way, it was possible to ascertain what part of the leader was actually needed by the import apparatus.Previously, it was shown that the R3Q,R10Q double mutant pALDH was not imported (6Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here we report that if this modified leader was fused to the R3Q,R10Q pALDH, import was restored. This shows that two non-functional leaders could actually be used to import a protein. The reason this double leader was functional in import could be that the internal leader-like structures shown in Fig. 1 actually were the portion of the precursor that was involved in the translocation process. No such structural motif existed in the original R3Q,R10Q double mutant pALDH we previously investigated. From the various chimeric precursors used, it is concluded that an internal helix that is either a long continuous amphipathic helix or part of the helix-linker-helix motif could act as the actual leader. No attempt was made to determine how distal from the N terminus such a structure would function.Using the strategy described above, it was possible to show that the most N-terminal, non-functional segment could even possess a negative charge such as found in the R3Q,S7E double mutant of pALDH. This finding can then be used to explain how a natural precursor protein could possess a net negative charge at the start of the N-terminal sequence. It can be argued that the import apparatus simply ignores the unfavorable region and interacts with the positively charged stable helical domain that follows.To test for the above mentioned model we used Leu4 and Leu9, natural yeast proteins that possess negatively charged amino acids in the most N-terminal segment of their leader sequence. NMR spectroscopy was used to show that, as expected, the peptide corresponding to the leader of Leu4 formed a stable α helix. Before the yeast genome was obtained, only one form of the enzyme was known. The second gene product, Leu9 (which has 80% identity with Leu4), was identified later, but the protein was not characterized (15Casalone E. Barberio C. Cavalieri D. Polsinelli M. Yeast. 2000; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). First, in vitro import was used to show that Leu9, like Leu4, is a mitochondrial protein. Unexpectedly, the Leu4 precursor was not imported under conditions that allowed the Leu9 to be imported. A chimeric protein was made by fusing the purported leader segment of Leu4 or Leu9 to mature ALDH. When the first 21 residues of Leu4 (those found to be helical) were used, no import was found. But if the first 31 residues were used, import could occur. In a similar manner, the first 30 residues of Leu9 could import of mature ALDH, whereas the first 20 could not.We were concerned with the fact that we could not obtain import with Leu4 as others had reported (14Beltzer J.P.

Chem. 1982; 257: 13034-13041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to precipitate imported proteins. In contrast, the current experiments all used pure cDNAs. Given the fact that theLeu9 gene was not identified at the time the initial experiments were performed and that total RNA was used, it is possible that the Leu9 gene product was detected rather than the product for Leu4. We conclude that under the in vitro experimental procedures used in this study, Leu4 was not imported to the mitochondrial matrix space.The N-terminal portion of Leu4 and Leu9 provided a 21- or 20-residue helix thought to provide the essential structure for a region that does not possess a net positive charge. Our data revealed that the N-terminal region containing the negative charges formed the most stable part of the helix. However, the region that seemed most responsible for import of Leu4 or Leu9 was not the most helical portion of the leader, because the targeting signal seemed to appear after residue 11. It is generally accepted that before import to the mitochondria preproteins remain unfolded. A proteolysis assay was performed with the TNT-synthesized Leu4. Proteinase K proteolysis results indicated that the Leu4 was more resistant to digestion than was the Leu4(Δ1–11) protein (data not shown). A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the most N-terminal 11 residues of Leu4 contribute to the overall structure of the protein. Without these residues the native folding of these proteins might be changed, as reflected by the instability of the protein and the proteinase K sensitivity. Therefore, the proteolysis results showed that Leu4 was folded and hence not imported to the mitochondria in an in vitro experiment. Some proteins that fold rapidly have been found to be imported to the mitochondria by a co-translocation pathway. The pALDH leader fused to green fluorescent protein (a protein that folds rapidly) was shown to be imported to the mitochondrial matrix space by a co-translational pathway (34Ni L. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12685-12691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, in vivo Leu4 could be translocated to the mitochondria through a co-translational pathway.The acid-chain hypothesis was based on the fact that the leader possessed positive charges at its N terminus, which could be important for binding with the TOM complex. However, it has been shown that the leader sequence of pALDH binds TOM20 through hydrophobic interactions (29Muto T. Obita T. Abe Y. Shodai T. Endo T. Kohda D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). TOM20 is the first receptor to be recognized by leader sequence and does not appear to depend on the positive charges of the leader sequence. It is possible that the other TOM protein may interact with positive charges present in leader sequence. Here we show that if the N-terminal segment is not positive, the translocator appears to recognize not the N termini but the region of the leader sequences that are positively charged. It has been shown that inner and intermembrane space proteins use an internal signal after the most N-terminal matrix space targeting signal (35Arnold I. Folsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1469-1476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Bomer U. Meijer M. Guiard B. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. Rassow J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30439-30446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). How the first 11 residues in the case of Leu4 enter the translocation pore cannot be explained at this time. If the model of import were co-translational and not post-translational as we suggest, then it is possible that an unknown cytosolic factor is necessary to insert the proteins into the TOM apparatus. Although the data presented in this study cannot explain how the precursor with negative charges interacts with the TOM proteins, they do show that the information for import need not lie at the very N terminus of the precursor protein. Most proteins found in the mitochondrial matrix space are encoded by nuclear genes and are synthesized on cytosolic polysomes. The preproteins typically carry N-terminal targeting sequences (leader sequence) that direct the proteins to the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM), 1The abbreviations used are: TOMtranslocase of the mitochondrial outer membranepALDHprecursor aldehyde dehydrogenaseIPMSisopropylmalate synthaseMPPmitochondrial processing peptidaseTFEtrifluoroethanollong formpreprotein containing the leader plus the mature part of IPMSshort formIPMS containing only the mature portion of IPMSIPMS4(1–21)a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 21 residues of Leu4NOESYNuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopyTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopy1The abbreviations used are: TOMtranslocase of the mitochondrial outer membranepALDHprecursor aldehyde dehydrogenaseIPMSisopropylmalate synthaseMPPmitochondrial processing peptidaseTFEtrifluoroethanollong formpreprotein containing the leader plus the mature part of IPMSshort formIPMS containing only the mature portion of IPMSIPMS4(1–21)a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 21 residues of Leu4NOESYNuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopyTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopy which consists of receptors and a general import pore (1Moczko M.

A common feature of leader sequences is the frequent occurrence of basic residues, particularly arginine, a residue that is found three times more often in the leaders than proteins (6Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because TOM proteins are negatively charged, an acid-chain hypothesis was developed to suggest that positive charges in the leader sequences are necessary for TOM to interact with negatively charged receptor proteins (7Schatz G.

As shown in Fig. 1, the leader is composed of 19 amino acids that can be induced into a helix-linker-helix amphiphilic structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol or detergent micelles (8Karslake C. Piotto M.E. Pak Y.K. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9872-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although each helical segment contains an equal number of positive charges, the N-terminal helical segment has been shown to be necessary to efficiently target the leader to the matrix space (9Wang Y. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4759-4765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If both of the arginines of the N-helical segment are substituted with glutamine, the ability to be imported is essentially eliminated, showing that the net positive charge in the N-helical segment is more important than the total positive charge throughout the leader (6Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Deletion of the linker results in a non-processable leader that is longer in helical content (10Thornton K. Wang Y. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19906-19914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is more capable of importing ALDH than is the native sequence in a cell-free import assay (6Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The enhanced stability of the linker-deleted leader has been used successfully to study structural aspects as a compensating factor for the loss of positive charges resulting from arginine to glutamine mutational substitutions. The linker-deleted structure can import a “passenger” protein even if both of the N-terminal arginine residues (Arg-3 and Arg-10) are mutated to glutamines (6Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the basis of the positive charge versus structural compensation model developed from our previous studies, glutamic and aspartic acid residues were systematically introduced into the pALDH leader to ascertain how negative charges may be tolerated. It was observed that when serine was replaced with glutamic acid, the S7E mutant pALDH was imported to an extent similar to pALDH; however, the R3Q,S7E double mutant was poorly imported (11Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29389-29393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This result implies that only a net positive charge was required for the proper import of a precursor into the matrix. Although negatively charged amino acids typically are not found in leader sequences, chaperonin 10 (12Hartman D.J. Hoogenraad N.J. Condron R. Hoj P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3394-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and rhodanese (13Miller D.M. Delgado R. Chirgwin J.M. Hardies S.C. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4686-4691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) each contain one negative charge. Different forms of yeast IPMS (coded byLeu4 and Leu9) contain one and two negative charges, respectively, in their leader sequences (14Beltzer J.P. Morris S.R. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 368-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Casalone E. Barberio C. Cavalieri D. Polsinelli M.

Yeast. 1997; 13: 655-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial IPMS provided us with a good model to study the mechanism of import of a natural protein with negative charges within the mitochondrial leader sequence. In this study, we used several chimeric and mutant forms of pALDH and IPMS containing neutral or negative charges in their leader sequences. We will show that some precursors could be imported to the mitochondrial matrix with a leader sequence that is not present at the most N-terminal portion. DISCUSSIONDuring the past decade much has been learned about the leader sequences of precursor proteins that are destined for the mitochondrial matrix space (3Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 27von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). No reports exist, however, to explain how a leader that does not possess a net positive charge at its N terminus is imported. During our studies with the positive charge in the ALDH leader, we often found that if the leader was made more helical it would compensate for the removal of positive charges (6Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). No actual structure for a precursor protein that possesses a cleavable leader sequence has been determined. NMR has been used to show that a number of peptides corresponding to leader sequences can indeed form α helices when bound to micelles or when in a hydrophobic environment (6Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,8Karslake C. Piotto M.E. Pak Y.K. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G.

Recently the structure of the aldehyde dehydrogenase leader bound to TOM20 was shown to be helical, supporting the notion that helicity is indispensable for its function (29Muto T. Obita T. Abe Y. Shodai T. Endo T. Kohda D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).A few precursor proteins do not possess positive charges in what could be considered to be the classical N-terminal leader sequence. For example, the non-processed precursors rhodanese (30Waltner M. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26311-26317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and chaperonin10 (31Ryan M.T. Hoogenraad N.J. Hoj P.B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1323-1331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have no positive charges in the first eight residues and actually have a negative charge in the leader. Leu4 leader has one lysine residue but two negative charges in its first 11 residues. These leader peptides were all found to be helical, consistent with our notion that structure can somehow overcome positive charge deficiency. Even if structure could overcome this situation, it is not apparent how the TOM complex, which contains patches of negative charges (7Schatz G. Nature. 1997; 388: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), can recognize the atypical leader.We took advantage of the two-leader strategy that we used previously to investigate the processing of leader peptides by MPP (18Mukhopadhyay A. Hammen P. Waltner-Law M. Weiner H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1026-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here a modified non-functional leader was fused to the N termini of a native or modified precursor protein. In this way, it was possible to ascertain what part of the leader was actually needed by the import apparatus.Previously, it was shown that the R3Q,R10Q double mutant pALDH was not imported (6Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here we report that if this modified leader was fused to the R3Q,R10Q pALDH, import was restored. This shows that two non-functional leaders could actually be used to import a protein. The reason this double leader was functional in import could be that the internal leader-like structures shown in Fig. 1 actually were the portion of the precursor that was involved in the translocation process. No such structural motif existed in the original R3Q,R10Q double mutant pALDH we previously investigated. From the various chimeric precursors used, it is concluded that an internal helix that is either a long continuous amphipathic helix or part of the helix-linker-helix motif could act as the actual leader. No attempt was made to determine how distal from the N terminus such a structure would function.Using the strategy described above, it was possible to show that the most N-terminal, non-functional segment could even possess a negative charge such as found in the R3Q,S7E double mutant of pALDH. This finding can then be used to explain how a natural precursor protein could possess a net negative charge at the start of the N-terminal sequence. It can be argued that the import apparatus simply ignores the unfavorable region and interacts with the positively charged stable helical domain that follows.To test for the above mentioned model we used Leu4 and Leu9, natural yeast proteins that possess negatively charged amino acids in the most N-terminal segment of their leader sequence. NMR spectroscopy was used to show that, as expected, the peptide corresponding to the leader of Leu4 formed a stable α helix. Before the yeast genome was obtained, only one form of the enzyme was known. The second gene product, Leu9 (which has 80% identity with Leu4), was identified later, but the protein was not characterized (15Casalone E. Barberio C. Cavalieri D. Polsinelli M. Yeast. 2000; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). First, in vitro import was used to show that Leu9, like Leu4, is a mitochondrial protein. Unexpectedly, the Leu4 precursor was not imported under conditions that allowed the Leu9 to be imported. A chimeric protein was made by fusing the purported leader segment of Leu4 or Leu9 to mature ALDH. When the first 21 residues of Leu4 (those found to be helical) were used, no import was found. But if the first 31 residues were used, import could occur. In a similar manner, the first 30 residues of Leu9 could import of mature ALDH, whereas the first 20 could not.We were concerned with the fact that we could not obtain import with Leu4 as others had reported (14Beltzer J.P. Morris S.R. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 368-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hampsey D.M. Lewin A.S. Kohlhaw G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Without these residues the native folding of these proteins might be changed, as reflected by the instability of the protein and the proteinase K sensitivity. Therefore, the proteolysis results showed that Leu4 was folded and hence not imported to the mitochondria in an in vitro experiment. Some proteins that fold rapidly have been found to be imported to the mitochondria by a co-translocation pathway. The pALDH leader fused to green fluorescent protein (a protein that folds rapidly) was shown to be imported to the mitochondrial matrix space by a co-translational pathway (34Ni L. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12685-12691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, in vivo Leu4 could be translocated to the mitochondria through a co-translational pathway.The acid-chain hypothesis was based on the fact that the leader possessed positive charges at its N terminus, which could be important for binding with the TOM complex. However, it has been shown that the leader sequence of pALDH binds TOM20 through hydrophobic interactions (29Muto T. Obita T. Abe Y. Shodai T. Endo T. Kohda D. J. Mol.

TOM20 is the first receptor to be recognized by leader sequence and does not appear to depend on the positive charges of the leader sequence. It is possible that the other TOM protein may interact with positive charges present in leader sequence. Here we show that if the N-terminal segment is not positive, the translocator appears to recognize not the N termini but the region of the leader sequences that are positively charged. It has been shown that inner and intermembrane space proteins use an internal signal after the most N-terminal matrix space targeting signal (35Arnold I. Folsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol.

Yeast. 2000; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). First, in vitro import was used to show that Leu9, like Leu4, is a mitochondrial protein. Unexpectedly, the Leu4 precursor was not imported under conditions that allowed the Leu9 to be imported. A chimeric protein was made by fusing the purported leader segment of Leu4 or Leu9 to mature ALDH. When the first 21 residues of Leu4 (those found to be helical) were used, no import was found. But if the first 31 residues were used, import could occur. In a similar manner, the first 30 residues of Leu9 could import of mature ALDH, whereas the first 20 could not. We were concerned with the fact that we could not obtain import with Leu4 as others had reported (14Beltzer J.P. Morris S.R. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 368-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hampsey D.M. Lewin A.S. Kohlhaw G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The previously published experimental procedure used total RNA for translation (14Beltzer J.P. Morris S.R. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 368-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hampsey D.M. Lewin A.S. Kohlhaw G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and antibodies (33Gasser S.M. Daum G. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13034-13041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to precipitate imported proteins. In contrast, the current experiments all used pure cDNAs. Given the fact that theLeu9 gene was not identified at the time the initial experiments were performed and that total RNA was used, it is possible that the Leu9 gene product was detected rather than the product for Leu4. We conclude that under the in vitro experimental procedures used in this study, Leu4 was not imported to the mitochondrial matrix space. The N-terminal portion of Leu4 and Leu9 provided a 21- or 20-residue helix thought to provide the essential structure for a region that does not possess a net positive charge. Our data revealed that the N-terminal region containing the negative charges formed the most stable part of the helix. However, the region that seemed most responsible for import of Leu4 or Leu9 was not the most helical portion of the leader, because the targeting signal seemed to appear after residue 11. It is generally accepted that before import to the mitochondria preproteins remain unfolded. A proteolysis assay was performed with the TNT-synthesized Leu4. Proteinase K proteolysis results indicated that the Leu4 was more resistant to digestion than was the Leu4(Δ1–11) protein (data not shown). A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the most N-terminal 11 residues of Leu4 contribute to the overall structure of the protein. Without these residues the native folding of these proteins might be changed, as reflected by the instability of the protein and the proteinase K sensitivity. Therefore, the proteolysis results showed that Leu4 was folded and hence not imported to the mitochondria in an in vitro experiment. Some proteins that fold rapidly have been found to be imported to the mitochondria by a co-translocation pathway. The pALDH leader fused to green fluorescent protein (a protein that folds rapidly) was shown to be imported to the mitochondrial matrix space by a co-translational pathway (34Ni L. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12685-12691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, in vivo Leu4 could be translocated to the mitochondria through a co-translational pathway. The acid-chain hypothesis was based on the fact that the leader possessed positive charges at its N terminus, which could be important for binding with the TOM complex. However, it has been shown that the leader sequence of pALDH binds TOM20 through hydrophobic interactions (29Muto T. Obita T. Abe Y. Shodai T. Endo T. Kohda D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). TOM20 is the first receptor to be recognized by leader sequence and does not appear to depend on the positive charges of the leader sequence. It is possible that the other TOM protein may interact with positive charges present in leader sequence. Here we show that if the N-terminal segment is not positive, the translocator appears to recognize not the N termini but the region of the leader sequences that are positively charged. It has been shown that inner and intermembrane space proteins use an internal signal after the most N-terminal matrix space targeting signal (35Arnold I. Folsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1469-1476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Bomer U. Meijer M. Guiard B. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. Rassow J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30439-30446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). How the first 11 residues in the case of Leu4 enter the translocation pore cannot be explained at this time. If the model of import were co-translational and not post-translational as we suggest, then it is possible that an unknown cytosolic factor is necessary to insert the proteins into the TOM apparatus. Although the data presented in this study cannot explain how the precursor with negative charges interacts with the TOM proteins, they do show that the information for import need not lie at the very N terminus of the precursor protein.

Titration of this fluorescence quenching with varying concentrations of ATP (0–600 μm), where Rho is shown to exist as a hexamer (400 nm Rho), revealed tight and loose ATP-binding sites. Bicyclomycin, a specific inhibitor of Rho, increased the tight ATP binding and was used to calibrate ATP-induced fluorescence quenching by using [γ-32P]ATP filter binding. For the Rho mutant F355W, three tight (Kd1 = 3 ± 0.3 μm) and three loose (Kd2 = 58 ± 3 μm) ATP-binding sites per hexamer were seen on Scatchard analysis in the absence of bicyclomycin and poly(C). In the presence of bicyclomycin, the Kd1 changed from 3.0 to 1.4 μm, but Kd2underwent a lesser change. The non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, γ-S-ATP, gave a similar profile with three tight (Kd1 = 0.2 μm) and three loose (Kd2 = 70 μm) ATP-binding sites per hexamer. Adding poly(C) to F355W did not alter the Kd1 orKd2 for ATP or for γ-S-ATP. ADP-induced quenching produced 5.5 loose (Kd = 92 μm) binding sites in the absence of poly(C), and the binding became weaker (Kd = 175 μm) in the presence of poly(C). The data suggest that in the presence of ADP Rho has six equivalent nucleotide-binding sites. When ATP was added these sites converted to three tight and three loose binding loci. We propose an alternating ATP site mechanism where ATP binding creates heterogeneity in the ATP binding in adjacent subunits, and we suggest that ATP binding to a neighboring loose site stimulates hydrolysis at a neighboring tight binding site such that all six subunits can be potential “active” sites for ATP hydrolysis. The dynamic nature of the ATP binding to Rho is discussed in the terms of the mechanism of RNA tracking driven by ATP hydrolysis.

The dynamic nature of the ATP binding to Rho is discussed in the terms of the mechanism of RNA tracking driven by ATP hydrolysis. Rho transcription termination factor from Escherichia coli is a homohexamer consisting of six identical 47-kDa subunits (1Pinkham J.L. Platt T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 3531-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) arranged in a toroid structure (2Bear D.G. Hicks P.S. Escudero K.W. Andrews C.L. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Oda T. Takanami M. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 71: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Details of the reaction mechanism have been presented in several reviews (4Platt T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Platt T. Richardson J.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 365-388Google Scholar). To summarize, Rho recognizes RNA transcripts destined for Rho termination by binding to nascent RNA at poorly defined rut sites (Rhoutilization) (6Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5760-5766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rho bound to RNA translocates 5′ to 3′ along the RNA driven by ATP hydrolysis (4Platt T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Chen C.-Y.A. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11292-11299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When Rho approaches the stalled RNA polymerase, it competes with the polymerase for RNA leading to transcription termination (5Platt T. Richardson J.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 365-388Google Scholar, 8Brennan C.A. Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Cell. 1987; 48: 945-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The primary RNA-binding site that recognizes the rut sequences is located in the first 151 amino acid residues (9Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which includes residues 61–66, GFGFLR, a conserved RNA-binding locus (10Martinez A. Burns C.M. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Brennan C.A. Platt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17296-17305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Movement of Rho along the RNA has been postulated to occur through the central hole of the toroid ring at a secondary RNA-binding site that is distinct from the rut recognition site (12Burgess B.R. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4182-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mutations in the Q-loop region of Rho (residues 285–292) affect secondary RNA binding and block transcription termination (13Wei R.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Specific, positively charged amino acid residues have been identified on the inner face of the central hole of Rho that directly alters tracking and transcription termination at the secondary RNA-binding site (14Xu Y. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30023-30030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These positive charged residues are located above (N-terminal subdomain) and below (C-terminal subdomain) the ATP hydrolysis pocket defined by the P-loop domain (residues 178–185). ATP hydrolysis is dependent on RNA binding at a secondary site (15Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Wang Y. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13940-13946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in the absence of RNA, Rho does not hydrolyze ATP. The movement of Rho along the RNA is coupled to ATP hydrolysis, and the interactions among RNA, Rho, and ATP generate a processive directional movement. Rho shares considerable sequence similarity and identity with the β-subunit of F1-ATP synthase (17Geiselmann J. Wang Y. Seifried S.E. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7754-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 18Dombroski A.J. LaDine J.R. Cross R.L. Platt T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7316-7324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and secondary structure predictions for each protein are similar (21Miwa Y. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 815-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A structural model of Rho based on the crystal structure of the α-, β-, and γ-subunits of F1-ATP synthase has been used to describe its function, including the binding of the antibiotic, bicyclomycin (20Magyar A. Zhang X. Abdi F. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7316-7324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Moyse K.A. Knight J.S. Richardson J.P. Biochim. Biophys.

F1-ATP synthase has five distinct subunits, α, β, γ, δ, and ε, in which three α- and three β-subunits form a toroid ring (24Walker J.E. Fearnley I.M. Gay N.J. Gibson B.W. Northrup F.D. Powell S.J. Runswick M.J. Saraste M. Tybulewicz V.L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 677-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) similar to Rho (25Geiselmann J. Yager T.D. Gill S.C. Calmettes P. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Yu X. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The β-subunits are catalytically active, whereas the α-subunits bind ATP much tighter than the β-subunits and do not support ATP hydrolysis (synthesis) (27Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). The three β-subunits alternate between three conformation states based on ATP binding: empty, loosely bound ADP and phosphate, and tight binding ATP (for review see Ref. 28Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This triphasic reaction mechanism promotes ATP synthesis by energy input from the electrochemical potential of the membrane (29Boyer P.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1998; 37: 2297-2307Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This potential drives the rotation of the γ-subunit. As the γ-subunit turns, it ratchets the switch between the three conformational states of the β-subunits. The release of ATP is the energy-requiring, rate-limiting step (30Cross R.L. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Rho, unlike F1-ATP synthase, is a homohexamer and hydrolyzes ATP to drive its 5′ to 3′ translocation along the RNA. Unlike F1-ATP synthase, hydrolysis of ATP is converted to translational motion not rotary motion. Movement of Rho is proposed to occur without rotation because rotation would presumably coil the RNA and impede translocation (31Vincent F. Openshaw M. Trautwein M. Gaskell S.J. Kohn H. Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9077-9083Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have proposed previously (14Xu Y. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30023-30030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) a detailed translocation mechanism whereby Rho moves along the RNA by binding RNA at two separate loci in the central hole. Unidirectional translocation requires more than one RNA-binding locus; binding between these sites is ordered and sequential, and the translocation is highly processive. RNA interaction at one locus is proposed to alternate between tight and loose binding phases, whereas RNA at the other site binds but in the opposite phase. Alternating RNA binding at each locus is postulated to be the result of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and release of ADP and phosphate within a subunit pair. Critical to elucidating the tracking mechanism of Rho is a detailed understanding of ATP binding and hydrolysis as it relates to movement along the RNA. Recently, several groups have reported [γ-32P]ATP binding to Rho using Scatchard binding analysis. These reports have differed as to the number and types of ATP-binding sites. One argument holds that only three ATP-binding sites are present in Rho (32Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Stitt B.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2276-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and ATP is sequentially hydrolyzed (34Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 373: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Other data suggest Rho has three tight and three loose ATP-binding sites, wherein the proposed ATP catalytic site exhibits loose binding and the control site exhibits tight binding, similar to the α-subunit of F1-ATP synthase (35Kim D.E. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32667-32671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 36Kim D.E. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13902-13910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 37Kim D.E. Shigesada K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11623-11628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These conclusions were based, in part, on the similarity of Rho and F1-ATP synthase as a model for ATP binding and hydrolysis in which certain adenosine trinucleotides remained tightly bound during conditions of continuing hydrolysis (37Kim D.E. Shigesada K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11623-11628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, these finding have not been reproduced in other laboratories (33Stitt B.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2276-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Still another group suggests that there are two types of ATP-binding sites that provide three strong and three weak loci (38Geiselmann J. von Hippel P.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Measured by affinity constants, the lower affinity site matched the reciprocal of the Km value of Rho for ATP (38Geiselmann J. von Hippel P.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These authors concluded that ATP binding may lead to conformational changes that create both high and low ATP affinity sites, where ATP hydrolysis occurs at the tight site in partial agreement with the three ATP-binding site models (34Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 373: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and that the “weakly bound ATP would become strongly bound by a conformation change within the dimer.” (38Geiselmann J. von Hippel P.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) Furthermore, these authors suggested that ATP permanently bound to a tight site would block the reaction cycle. Previous determinations of the Kd for ATP binding were carried out in the absence of RNA where Rho is locked into a non-catalytic, hydrolytically inactive conformation. ATP binding has not been measured in the presence of RNA because RNA activates Rho and prevents thermodynamic equilibrium measurements. ATP hydrolysis is rapid; most of the ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and phosphate in the time it takes to measure bound ATP (33Stitt B.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2276-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 37Kim D.E. Shigesada K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11623-11628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the filter binding techniques that were used in some of these studies often did not accurately measure loosely bound ATP. Rinsing or washing the filter removes weaker binding ATP with adventitiously bound ATP. Thus, corrections were made in some cases to account for spurious ATP binding. To measure ATP binding to Rho more accurately, we mutated phenylalanine 355 (Phe-355) to tryptophan (F355W) (14Xu Y. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30023-30030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Based on sequence alignment and the structural model of Rho (31Vincent F. Openshaw M. Trautwein M. Gaskell S.J. Kohn H. Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9077-9083Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), Phe-355 is analogous to β-Tyr-331 of the E. coli F1-ATP synthase. The mutation β-Y331W in F1-ATP synthase allowed ATP binding to be measured by fluorescence quenching (39Weber J. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5112-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 40Weber J. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Wise J.G. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 27: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Here we document ATP and ADP binding in terms of their dissociation constants derived from fluorescent quenching in the F355W mutant. We also measure the effects of poly(C) and bicyclomycin on the nucleotide dissociation constants. The changes on ATP dissociation constant are discussed in terms of the mechanism of Rho translocation 5′ to 3′ along RNA. Bicyclomycin was kindly provided by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), and was further purified by three successive silica gel chromatographies using 20% methanol/chloroform as the eluant (42Park H. Zhang X. Moon H. Zwiefka A. Cox K. Gaskell S.J.

T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega Co. (Madison, WI). Pfu DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The metal chelating column was from Amersham Biosciences. Radionucleotides [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci mmol−1) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and nucleotides and RNase inhibitor were from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). Polyethylenimine thin layer chromatography plates used for ATPase assays were purchased from J. T. Baker, Inc. (Phillipsburg, NJ). Ribo(C)10 was obtained from Oligos, Etc. (Wilsonville, OR), and ATP analogues were from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade. The plasmids pET-RhoW (wild-type Rho) and pET-355W (F355W Rho) were used as templates for DNA amplification. Overlapping primers with the desired mutation (W381Y) forward, 5′-gaactgcagaaaatgtatatcctgcgcaaaatc-3′, andreverse,5′-gattttgcgcaggatatacattttctgcagttc-3′, were used to introduce base changes, as described in the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The resulting PCR-amplified plasmid DNA was digested withDpnI and transformed into host strain JM109. Isolated plasmid DNA from the transformed cells was sequenced to identify specific site changes. The entire rho gene was sequenced to ensure no other mutations were present in the mutated genes. The F355W Rho mutant was generated from pET-RhoW (14Xu Y. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30023-30030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Assays for poly(C)-dependent ATPase activity and poly(dC)-ribo(C)10-dependent ATPase activity were carried out at 32 °C, and transcription termination was carried out at 37 °C as described (20Magyar A. Zhang X. Abdi F. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7316-7324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Expression of the mutant Rho proteins was carried out by transforming the pET plasmid into the salt-induced T7 polymerase host BL21-SI (Invitrogen). Cells were grown on NaCl-free LB media at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.5 at 550 nm and induced by the addition of 0.3 m NaCl. Rho was isolated from 500-ml cultures induced for 4–10 h. The induced cells were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and suspended in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5% glycerol, 0.23 mNaCl, and 0.1 mmDTT. 1The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolAMP-PCPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylenetriphosphate)AMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 23 μg/ml, and lysozyme was added to 130 μg/ml. After digestion for 1 h at 25 °C, the suspension was briefly sonicated using a Branson probe sonicator and was centrifuged at 17,000 rpm for 30 min. The clear yellow supernatant was placed directly on a metal chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with nickel sulfate as per the manufacturer's instructions. The column was washed with 10 ml of the wash buffer (0.02m sodium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.2) and then with another 10 ml of wash buffer containing 10 mmimidazole, and Rho protein was eluted using an imidazole gradient from 10 to 500 mm in wash buffer. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA protein assay as described (43Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fjuimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olsen B.J.

Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32667-32671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The nitrocellulose membrane circles (25 mm) were treated with 0.5 n NaOH, rinsed extensively with distilled water, and equilibrated in the binding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 12 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) before use. The reactions (50 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 12 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 400 nm Rho hexamer, 400 μm bicyclomycin, and various concentrations (0.5–300 μm) of ATP mixed with [γ-32P]ATP were incubated at room temperature (∼10 min) and then filtered through the nitrocellulose membrane assembly. The membranes were washed with 1 ml of binding buffer with 400 μm bicyclomycin before and after filtration. The radioactivity on the membrane was quantitated using a scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000SC). The fluorescence of F335W and wild-type Rho was carried out in a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter at 22 °C using 400 nm Rho hexamer in 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 12 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm DTT with a stirred cuvette. Emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 450 nm with excitation at 280 nm and zeroing at 300 nm, which allowed the comparison of spectra. Fluorescence quenching in the absence of RNA was measured by the addition of ATP to the stirred cuvette, waiting 1 min, and recording the spectra. ATP or ADP was added in range from 0.1 to 600 μm in the absence of poly(C). The ATP/ADP titrations were also conducted in the presence of 400 μmbicyclomycin. The non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues, γ-S-ATP, AMP-PNP, and AMP-PCP, were used to titrate the fluorescence quenching of F355W in the absence and presence of 400 μm bicyclomycin. The extent of fluorescence quenching in the presence of poly(C) was measured using the spectrofluorimeter in the kinetic mode. Rho plus poly(C) was premixed and diluted into a fluorescence cuvette with stirring. Excitation was at 280 nm, whereas emission was measured at 350 nm as a function of time. After ATP addition (10 s), a new fluorescence base line was established, and the percent of quenching was measured using 600 μm ATP at 100%. The second order rate constants for the binding of ATP to Rho (240 nm hexamer) were measured at 10 °C for each of five ATP concentrations (5, 10, 30, 60, and 120 μm) using an SFA-20 Rapid Kinetics Accessory and Pneumatic Drive (Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, UK) stop-flow attachment with a fluorescence cuvette inserted into the Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter. The measurements were repeated in the presence of either 20 nmpoly(C) or 80 μm bicyclomycin. Fluorescence quenching at 350 nm was measured in kinetic mode at 10 °C using a circulating water bath to maintain temperature of the stop-flow syringes and the measuring cuvette. Rho, Rho and poly(C), or Rho and bicyclomycin were placed in one syringe and ATP in the other. Fluorescence quenching using 600 μm ATP was assumed to completely quench Rho fluorescence. Initial rates were measured in triplicate for each ATP concentration and reported as average ± S.D. The overall average is the average of all 15 measurements ± S.D. Sedimentation coefficients were carried out as described (44Gan E. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16882-16888Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Samples containing 4, 40, and 400 nm Rho hexamer in the absence or presence of 1 or 600 μm ATP in 400 μl of sedimentation buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol) were layered on the top of a 5-ml 10–30% linear glycerol gradient. For samples containing ATP, the same ATP concentrations were present in the glycerol gradients. Sedimentation markers were 400 μl of 80 μg of bovine liver catalase (11.15 S), 400 μl of 30 μg of calf intestinal mucosa alkaline phosphatase (6.23 S), and 400 μl of 225 μg of bovine hemoglobin (4.3 S) and were layered on the glycerol gradient in separate tubes. After centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor, 200-μl fractions were collected. The fractions were assayed as described (44Gan E. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16882-16888Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For ATPase assays, 10 (for 4 nm Rho hexamer) or 2.5 μl (for 40 and 400 nm Rho hexamer) of each fraction was added to ATPase buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.25 mm ATP, 0.1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 40 nm poly(C). The reaction was allowed to proceed 20, 10, and 1 min for 4, 40, and 400 nm Rho hexamer, respectively. Phosphate release was measured on the PhosphorImager plates by using Fuji BAS 1000 BioImaging Analyzer. Marker proteins were detected as described (44Gan E. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16882-16888Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Kmand Vmax values for His-tagged F355W Rho were compared with wild-type His-tagged Rho to determine whether the change from phenylalanine to tryptophan adversely altered Rho function. The poly(C)-dependent ATPase activity at saturating ATP concentrations showed that F355W had a kcat of 1000 min−1 compared with 2380 min−1 for wild-type, and F355W had a Km for ATP of 83 μm compared with wild-type of 58 μm. Thekcat for poly(dC)-ribo(C)10-dependent ATPase activity with saturating concentrations of ATP and varying ribo(C)10for F355W was 500 min−1 compared with 850 min−1 for wild-type, and the Km for ribo(C)10 for F355W was 26 μm compared with 9.1 μm for wild-type. Transcription termination efficiencies for F355W were 96% that of wild-type (14Xu Y. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30023-30030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We concluded from these data that the substitution of tryptophan for phenylalanine did not significantly alter the kinetic properties of Rho and that F355W was a reasonable mutant of Rho to study ATP binding. Fluorescence quenching of F355W Rho as a function of ATP concentrations measured at room temperature (22 °C) is seen in Fig.1A. The residue Phe-355 is projected to be base stacked to the adenosine ring of ATP (14Xu Y. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol.

Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by substitution of the analogous residue in E. coli F1-ATP synthase, β-Tyr-331 to tryptophan (40Weber J. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Wise J.G. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Fig. 1B shows the change in fluorescence quenching of F355W at 350 nm as a function of ATP concentration. The curve could only be fitted to a two-component exponential decay suggesting that two different binding sites were present. A Scatchard plot of the ATP-induced fluorescence quenching of F355W showed a biphasic curve instead of a straight line for the binding of ATP (Fig. 2, ●). However, on the basis of the data generated from the Scatchard plot, three assumptions were made, and they require validation. The first is that all the fluorescence quenching arose from the binding of six molecules of ATP per hexamer. The second is that Trp-381 did not contribute to the fluorescence quenching by ATP. The final assumption is that Rho in solution was hexameric and not a combination of monomers and dimers.Figure 2Scatchard analysis of ATP binding to F355W Rho.

The protein structural motif that binds cAMP is highly conserved with the exception of loops 3 and 4, whose structure and length are variable. The cAMP receptor protein of Escherichia coli, CRP, was employed as a model system to elucidate the functional roles of these loops. Based on the sequence differences between CRP and cyclic nucleotide gated channel, three mutants of CRP were constructed: deletion (residues 54–56 in loop 3 were deleted), insertion (loop 4 was lengthened by 5 residues between Glu-78 and Gly-79) and double mutants. The effects of these mutations on the structure and function of CRP were monitored. Results show that the deletion and insertion mutations do not significantly change the secondary structure of CRP, although the tertiary and quaternary structures are perturbed. The functional data indicate that loop 3 modulates the binding affinities of cAMP and DNA. Although the lengthened loop 4 may have some fine-tuning functions, the specific function of the original loop 4 of CRP remains uncertain. The function consequences of mutation in loop 3 of CRP are similar to that of site A and site B in the regulatory subunits of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases. Thus, the roles played by loop 3 in CRP may represent a more common mechanism employed by cyclic nucleotide binding domain in modulating ligand binding affinity and intramolecular communication.

These proteins are involved in a very diverse set of cellular functions such as signal transduction, excitability, and gene expression (1Passner J.M. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 2Weber I.T. Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6122-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 3Shabb J.B.

Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These proteins of diverse functions all consist of a cAMP binding motif. The structural motif, which serves as cAMP receptor, is found to display a high degree of similarity. X-ray crystallography and homology modeling results show that, despite obvious divergence of sequence among the receptor domains and significantly different biological functions of these proteins, their CNB domains appear to share a common architecture, all consisting of an α-helix (helix A), an eight-stranded β-roll, and two more α-helices (helices B and C). The body of the CNB pocket is mainly located in the β-roll, with the C-helix forming the back of the binding pocket (2Weber I.T. Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6122-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Bubis J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The superimposition of the structures of CNB domains from CRP and the regulatory subunits of PKA, as shown below in Fig. 1, indicates that the β-roll basically assumes the same structure with the exception of loops 3 and 4 between strands 4 and 5, and strands 6 and 7, respectively. In some cases, such as in CNGC and PKA, loop 3 is shortened whereas loop 4 is lengthened, as shown in Fig.1. Only six residues (Gly-33, Gly-45, Gly-71, Glu-72, Arg-82, and Ala-84 using the CRP sequence as reference) are invariant among all members of the families. It has been suggested that the invariant residues play important and conserved roles in the folding and function of the CNB sites of these diverse proteins. Gly-33, Gly-45, and Gly-71 are involved in turns between strands of the β-roll; Arg-82 and Glu-72 contact the cyclic nucleotide, and the function of Ala-84 is uncertain (3Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5723-5726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite large variation of primary sequences, the sizes of secondary structural elements of the CNB domain are much conserved among the family. For example, the alignment of CRP and CNGCs by keeping the six conserve residues at the same positions shows that the size differences in secondary structural elements are only located at two loops, e.g. loop 3 (between β4 and β5) of CNGCs is shorter than that in CRP by three residues, and loop 4 (between β6 and β7) of CNGCs is 5 residues longer than that of CRP (see Fig. 2) (6Scott S.P. Harrison R.W. Weber I.T. Tanaka J.C. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similarly, loops 3 and 4 among the various protein kinase isozymes also show heterogeneity in size, as shown in Fig. 2.Figure 2Amino acid sequence alignment of CRP and other cyclic nucleotide binding domains. See Refs. 6Scott S.P. Harrison R.W. Weber I.T. Tanaka J.C. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar and 8Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Bubis J. Taylor S.S.

To elucidate the roles of these loops the cAMP receptor protein, CRP, from E. coli is employed as a model system for investigation. CRP of Escherichia coli, also referred to as the catabolite gene activator protein, is a 47,238-Da homodimer. Each subunit has two domains: the large N-terminal domain is a cyclic nucleotide binding domain, and the small C-terminal domain is a DNA binding domain. ApoCRP has very low affinity for DNA and cannot differentiate between specific and nonspecific DNA sequences, whereas holoCRP exhibits high affinity for specific DNA sequences. It is known that binding of cAMP allosterically induces CRP to assume conformations that exhibit high affinity for specific DNA sequences (9Harman J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 10Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Busby S.

A. 1997; 94: 2843-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that allosteric conformational change, which includes subunit realignment and domain rearrangement, occurs upon the binding of cAMP to CRP. These changes are mediated by interactions involving the subunit and domain interfaces. The C-helix and the hinge region between the domains have been found to play key roles in transmitting the allosteric signal. Although earlier spectroscopic comparison between the holo- and apoCRP showed no apparent secondary structural changes (14DeGrazia H. Harman J.G. Tan G.S. Wartell R.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3557-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Tan G.S. Kelly P. Kim J. Wartell R.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 3200-3204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the results of protein footprinting experiments and recent NMR studies indicate that there are wide-ranging structural differences between apoCRP and holoCRP. cAMP binding, while perturbing the β-roll that forms the cAMP binding pocket, has little effect on the secondary structure elements contained in either the N- or the C-terminal domains. There does, however, appear to be a significant difference around the C terminus of C-helix, the hinge region, and loop 3 (1Passner J.M. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 17Baichoo N. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10830-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Baichoo N. Heyduk T.

These studies identified the location of structural changes induced by cAMP binding but do not provide information on the role of these structures in this β-roll motif in binding cyclic nucleotides.It was postulated that loop 3 in CRP is involved in both interdomain and intersubunit interactions, whereas loop 4 contacts the coiled-coil C-helices and forms part of the dimer interface (1Passner J.M. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), although the effects of these interactions in CRP function were not predictable by structural analysis alone. In recent studies, it was shown that a D53H mutation in loop 3 leads to enhancements of the magnitude of positive cooperativity in cAMP binding and affinity for specific DNA (21Lin S.H. Kovac L. Chin A.L. Chin C.C.Q. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2946-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Lin S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11857-11867Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These solution biophysical data are consistent with the proposal that loop 3 plays a role in interdomain and intersubunit communications, although the specific nature of this role is unknown. In this study, three mutants of CRP are constructed according to the difference in sequence alignment between CRP and CNGC, namely, a deletion of residues 54–56 in loop 3 and insertion of 5 residues between residues 78 and 79, respectively. The choices for specific sequences for deletion and insertion are based on the availability of information on CNGC. Consequently, it is possible to compare and contrast the data acquired in this study with the literature. These mutants are the subjects of investigation to elucidate the roles of these loops in the normal function of CRP.MATERIALS AND METHODSAll in vitro experiments were conducted in TEK (100) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA at pH 7.8 and 22.5 °C). The concentrations of protein, cyclic nucleotides, and fluorescence probes were determined by absorption spectroscopy using the following absorption coefficients: 40,800 m−1cm−1 at 278 nm for CRP and its mutants, 14,650 m−1cm−1at 271 nm for cAMP, 12,950 m−1cm−1 at 254 nm for cGMP, 33,000m−1cm−1 at 385 nm for CPM, and 6,240 m−1cm−1 at 351 nm for ANS. All the solutions were made with reagent grade or higher grade chemicals and filtered prior to use.Site-directed MutagenesisThe sites and nature of mutations in loops 3 and 4 are based on the sequence differences between CRP and CNGC, namely, a deletion of Glu-54, Glu-55, and Gly-56 in loop 3 and an insertion of the sequence KGSKM between Glu-78 and Gly-79 in loop 4, as shown in Fig. 2. An overlap extension PCR method was used (23Sambrook J. Russel D.W. 3rd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 13.36-13.39Google Scholar). The outer pairs of primers include anNdeI site and an HindIII site, respectively. The sequences were: TAA CCG CATATG GTG CTT GG and CCA CTC CGA CAAGCTT AA CGA GTG CCG. The sequences of mutagenesis primers for insertion were ACG TTC CTG GCC CATCTTAGAGCCCTT CTC TTC AAA CAG GCC CAG and GTT TGA AGA G AAGGGCTCTAAGATG GGC CAG GAA CGT AGC GCA; those for deletion were AGG AGA GGA TCA TTT CTT T GTC TTT GAT CAG CAC TGC C and GGC AGT GCT GAT CAA AGA C AAA GAA ATG ATC CTC TCC T. The products of the second round of amplification were inserted into the pET30a plasmid, and the constructs were sequenced after cloning.Protein PurificationWild-type and mutant CRPs were purified from E. coli strain HMS174(DE3) using a previously described protocol (21Lin S.H. Kovac L. Chin A.L. Chin C.C.Q. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2946-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24Cheng X. Kovac L. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10816-10826Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All purified CRP proteins were >99% homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE stained by Coomassie Blue; 50–60 μg of CRP was routinely loaded onto each lane. Furthermore, the ratios of the absorbance at 280 nm to that at 260 nm were >1.86, indicating the absence of nucleic acid contamination. The mass of proteins was further checked by mass spectrometry.Analytical UltracentrifugationExperiments were conducted at appropriate speeds in a Beckman Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and an An60Ti rotor. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 42K rpm. Velocity data were collected at 280 nm at a spacing of 0.002 cm with no averaging in a continuous scan mode and were analyzed using DCDT+ version 1.12. The reported weight-average sedimentation coefficient values (s̄20,w) obtained from DCDT+ were calculated by a weighted integration over the entire range of sedimentation coefficients covered by the g(s) distribution and corrected for the solution density and viscosity.The apparent weight-average molecular weights were obtained by fitting the sedimentation equilibrium data with the following equation,C=E+C1exp(1−ν¯ρ)ω22RTM(r2−ro2)Equation 1 +C22Kaexp(1−ν¯ρ)ω22RT2M(r2−ro2)where C is the observed CRP concentration in absorbance at radial position r, E is the baseline offset, C1 and C2 are the CRP concentrations of monomeric and dimeric CRP, respectively, at the meniscus r0,ν̄ is the partial specific volume, ρ is the solvent density, ω is the angular velocity, M is the apparent weight-average molecular weight, and R and T are the gas constant and temperature in degrees kelvin, respectively.Ka is the apparent association constant. The value of ν̄ of CRP in Tris buffer is 0.744 and was derived from the amino acid composition of CRP using the method of Cohn and Edsall (25Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides. Van Nostrans-Reinhold, NJ1943: 372Google Scholar). The apparent partial specific volumes of wild-type and mutant CRPs in 6m GdnHCl were calculated using the procedure of Lee and Timasheff (26Lee J.C. Timasheff S.N. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 61: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The corresponding values in lower concentrations of GdnHCl were interpolated by assuming a linear relationship between GdnHCl bound and denaturant concentration.The quaternary structure of CRP mutant was monitored by sedimentation equilibrium using a published procedure (27Cheng X. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In most cases, the subunit-subunit interaction of CRP was strong and could not be estimated directly by sedimentation equilibrium. The CRP dimerization was weakened by increasing amounts of GdnHCl, and the quaternary structure of CRP was monitored under each GdnHCl concentration. The loading CRP concentrations were between 0.2 and 0.4 mg/ml. Usually, 200-μl samples were loaded in a 12-mm Epon charcoal-filled centerpiece. The high speed, meniscus depletion procedure was employed (28Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar).Having determined the value of Ka by Equation 1, ΔGa values, the free energy changes for subunit assembly at different concentrations of GdnHCl, were calculated and fitted by a linear least-squares analysis to Equation 2,−RT lnKa=ΔGa=ΔGao+ma[GdnHCl]Equation 2 where R and T are the gas constant and absolute temperatures, respectively, ΔGaois the extrapolated free energy changes of subunit assembly of CRP in buffer, and ma is the dependence of ΔGa on denaturant concentration.Circular Dichroism Data Acquisition and AnalysisCD measurements were performed on an AVIV 62DS CD spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm (for far-UV region) or 1.0-cm (for near-UV region) path length microcuvette (200-μl capacity). The protein concentration used was 7 μm. CD spectra were measured over the range of 200–320 nm. Each spectrum was recorded in 0.5-nm wavelength increments, and signal was acquired for 1 s at each wavelength. Each measurement was performed in triplicate. Deviations between scans were negligible. Baseline subtraction and smoothing of spectra curves were performed using the AVIV CDS program.Fluorescence Data Acquisition and AnalysisFluorescence measurements were carried out in 1-cm quartz cuvettes at 22.5 °C using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrometer. Protein concentration was 5 μm. Samples were excited at 295 nm, and tryptophan emission was monitored from 310 to 400 nm. Acrylamide quenching measurements were carried out on samples containing acrylamide (0–0.7 m), either without or with 200 μm cAMP. Quenching data were plotted using the Stern-Volmer equation,Fo/F=(1+Ksv[Q])(1+V[Q])Equation 3 where Fo/F is the fractional decrease in fluorescence due to the quencher ([Q]), and Ksv and V are the collisional and static quenching constants, respectively.Cyclic Nucleotide Binding AssayCyclic nucleotide binding to CRP and mutants were measured by the quenching of ANS-CRP fluorescence according to the protocol described previously with minor modification (12Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6914-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was 12.5 μm. The binding data fitted with a three-site model (for cAMP binding to wild-type CRP) and a two-site model (for cAMP binding to mutants and all cGMP binding), respectively, in accordance to a previous observation (22Lin S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11857-11867Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar),CRP+L↔k1CRP·L+L↔k2CRP·L2+L↔k3CRP·L3Equation 4 where Ki is the association constant for the binding of the ith ligand. The observed fluorescence parameter is related to Ki by,Fobs=∑inXiFi;Xi=αi/∑i=0nαiEquation 5 where Fobs is the normalized value of observed fluorescence intensity at 480 nm, n is the total number of L molecules bound to a CRP molecule, iis the number of bound L molecules, and Xi and Fi are the fractions of CRP sub-conformation with different numbers of L bound and its fluorescence property, respectively. Xi is related to the fraction distribution parameter, αi, which corresponds to the number of L bound: for i = 0, α0 = 1; i = 1, α1 = 2k1[L];i = 2, α2 =k1k2[L]2; and i = 3, α3 = 2k1k2k3[L]3.DNA BindingFluorescence anisotropy measurements, by the SLM 8000C spectrofluorometer, were employed for quantitative evaluation of the CRP-DNA interaction. The DNA binding site was the 26-bp fragment of the lac PI promoter with the sequence 5′-ATTAATGTGAGTTAGCTCACTCATTA-3′. The underlined sequence is the primary binding site for CRP. The reaction mixture of 1300–1350 μl contained 12 nm of the CPM-labeled 26-bp fragment of lac promoter DNA and 230 μm cyclic nucleotide. At 230 μm, the high affinity sites for cyclic nucleotides are occupied in all CRPs employed in this study (22Lin S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11857-11867Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The detailed experimental and data analysis protocols have been previously described (21Lin S.H. Kovac L. Chin A.L. Chin C.C.Q. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2946-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, the data were fitted to the following equation by non-linear least-squares to determine the apparent association constant for CRP-DNA interaction,K,A=AD+(APD−AD)×(KDT+KPT)+1−(KDT+KPT+1)2−4K2DTPT2KDTEquation 6 where A is the measured value of the anisotropy,AD and APD are values of anisotropy with free DNA and CRP·DNA complex, respectively,DT and PT are the total molar concentrations of DNA and dimeric protein, respectively.GdnHCl DenaturationStock solutions of 6.9 mGdnHCl were prepared in TEK (100), and the concentrations were determined with a Mettler-Paar Precision density meter. Proteins at 5 μm were unfolded in various concentrations of GdnHCl for 1 h at room temperature. Protein unfolding was monitored by CD, and the data were expressed as SD, the measured CD signal was normalized to SD at 0m GdnHCl.DISCUSSIONSome loops in proteins seem to serve as no more than connectors between secondary structural elements, others play much more important functional roles, such as in defining stability (29Thompson M.J. Eisenberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 30Minard P. Scalley-Kim M. Watters A. Baker D. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). On the basis of structural information and results of mutagenesis analyses, it was proposed that loop 3 in CRP is involved in both interdomain and intersubunit interactions, whereas loop 4 contacts the C-helices and is proposed to form part of the dimer interface (1Passner J.M. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Some point mutations, either within or just outside of these loops, have been reported to significantly affect the function of CRP, e.g. K52N, D53H, and S62F (beside loop 3) and E72A, K82Q, and S83K (beside loop 4) (21Lin S.H. Kovac L. Chin A.L. Chin C.C.Q. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2946-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Lin S.H. Lee J.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2894-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Results from protein footprinting and NMR experiments indicate that the regions, including these loops exhibit significant environmental changes upon cAMP binding (18Baichoo N. Heyduk T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Won H.S. Yamazaki T. Lee T.W. Yoon M.K. Park S.H. Otoma T. Kyogoku Y. Lee B.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13953-13962Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All these results imply that these loops are involved in the functioning of CRP. This conjecture on structure-function correlation is further supported by an alignment analysis of the protein sequence of CNB (Fig. 2) that reveals an intriguing pattern. The sizes of loops 3 and 4 are the only ones of the loop structures that are varied. In cyclic nucleotide-gated channels there are deletion and extension in the sequences of loop 3 and 4, respectively. In cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, the sequence variation mostly resides in loop 3. Thus, it is of interest to probe for the roles of these loops in CRP.CRP is a transcription factor that exhibits allosteric behavior. There is homotropic effects in the biding of cAMP and heterotropic effect between cAMP and DNA bindings. The deletion of residues 54–56 (EEG) in loop 3 leads to the most significant perturbations in the normal functional properties of CRP. The binding affinity of the first cAMP molecule is significantly weaker than that of the wild-type CRP, however, the mutation also enhances the binding affinity for the second cAMP molecule, leading to a significant enhancement of positive cooperativity as indicated by the steeper binding isotherm (Fig. 9 and Table II). These results indicate that the deletion of residues 54–56 alters the site-site interactions in cAMP binding, leading to an enhancement of the homotropic effect. In addition, the deletion mutation leads to a detectable, albeit small, decrease in DNA affinity,i.e. a negative impact on the heterotropic effect between cAMP and DNA binding sites (Fig. 10). This mutation also lowers the energetics of subunit assembly. Thus, a perturbation of this loop amplifies its impact on functional sites that are located at different parts of CRP and spatially quite a few angstroms away. The specific nature of functional impacts by loop 3 mutation on CRP is apparently also observed in the various isozymes of protein kinases. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the sequence differences between sites A and B of the regulatory subunit are often localized in loop 3, namely, in general there is a deletion of a few residues in loop 3 of site A as compared with site B. It has long been established that the binding affinity of site A is lower than site B, an observation parallel that of the deletion and wild-type CRP, respectively. It is not surprising that cooperativity of ligand binding is different between these two type of sites (35Corbin J.D. Sugden P.H. West L. Flockhart D.A. Lincoln T.M. McCarty D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).One might speculate on the mechanism that enables loop 3 to exert these homotropic and heterotropic effects. Residue 136 of the adjacent subunit forms a complex with loop 3. This might be one of the paths of intersubunit and interdomain interactions. Any mutation that leads to a perturbation of this interaction could be expected to affect the allosteric behavior, as shown in this study. Furthermore, the nature of the perturbation could be manifested to yield different functional consequences. For example, mutations at residues 52 and 62 lead to decreases in both homotropic and heterotropic effects, but mutation at residues 53 leads to an opposite effect (21Lin S.H. Kovac L. Chin A.L. Chin C.C.Q. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2946-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Lin S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11857-11867Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, apparently, perturbations of residues in loop 3 can modulate the allosteric effects either positively or negatively. Therefore, the role of loop 3 is a modulator in the true sense.The insertion of five residues in loop 4 seems to have only marginal effects on the functional properties of CRP. There is no significant perturbation in cAMP binding, and the effect on DNA binding is small, although the energetics of subunit assembly is reduced. Thus, these results are consistent with the proposal that loop 4 forms part of the dimer interface (1Passner J.M. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Results of the double mutant show that"
