To establish the linkage between Wnts and osteoblast survival and to elucidate the molecular pathways that link the two, we have utilized three cell models: the uncommitted bipotential C2C12 cells, the pre-osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1, and bone marrow-derived OB-6 osteoblasts. Serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis was prevented by the canonical Wnts (Wnt3a and Wnt1) and the noncanonical Wnt5a in all cell types. Wnt3a induced LRP5-independent transient phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of ERKs and phosphorylation of Src and Akt. The anti-apoptotic effect of Wnt3a was abrogated by inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling, as well as by inhibitors of MEK, Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), or Akt kinases, or by the addition of cycloheximide to the culture medium. Wnt3a-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3β and downstream activation of β-catenin-mediated transcription required ERK, PI3K, and Akt signaling. Wnt3a increased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in an ERK-dependent manner. β-Catenin-mediated transcription was permissive for the anti-apoptotic actions of Wnt1 and Wnt3a but was dispensable for the anti-apoptotic action of Wnt5a. However, Src, ERKs, PI3K, and Akt kinases were required for the anti-apoptotic effects of Wnt5a. These results demonstrate for the first time that Wnt proteins, irrespective of their ability to stimulate canonical Wnt signaling, prolong the survival of osteoblasts and uncommitted osteoblast progenitors via activation of the Src/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades.

On the other hand, overexpression of the LRP5 G171V mutation or inactivation of SFRP-1 in mice reduces osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis, suggesting that the increased functional life span of osteoblasts is responsible, at least in part, for the favorable effects of Wnt signaling in bone (15Babij P.

We found that Wnt signaling prolongs the survival of uncommitted osteoblast progenitors and osteoblastic cells via activation of both the canonical pathway and the Src/ERK and PI3K/Akt cascades, with GSK-3β representing at least one convergence point between the two signaling cascades. β-Catenin-mediated transcription by itself is not sufficient to mediate the anti-apoptotic effects of canonical Wnts and is dispensable for the anti-apoptotic activity of Wnt5a.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—PD98059, wortmannin, etoposide, cycloheximide, and LiCl were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% each penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine, and 1% sodium pyruvate. Murine subcutaneous connective tissue-derived L-fibroblasts permanently transfected either with Wnt3a (L-Wnt3a) or an empty vector (L) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Control and Wnt3a conditioned media were prepared from L- and L-Wnt3a cells, respectively, as described by the supplier. Briefly, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 3 days, after which conditioned medium was collected, filter-sterilized, and stored at -70 °C until further use.Transient Transfections—To assay Wnt/β-catenin mediated transcription C2C12 cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH, 0.1 μg of each appropriate Wnt expression construct, and 0.1 μg of each constitutively active β-catenin or dominant negative mutants using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). TCF-luciferase activity was determined 24 h later using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter® assay system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Light intensity was measured with a luminometer, and luciferase activity was divided by the Renilla activity (control reporter) to normalize for transfection efficiency. To determine caspase3 activity, MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected as described above with 0.1 μg of pCaspase3-EYFP sensor vector and 0.1 μg of each dn kinase and were either treated with Wnt3a protein or co-transfected with 0.1 μg of Wnt5a expression construct.Quantification of Apoptotic Cells—Apoptotic cells were quantified by measuring caspase3 activity (Figs. 1, A and C, and 6C) as described previously (33Kousteni S.

The percentage of cells showing nuclear accumulation of ERK2 was quantified by enumerating those cells exhibiting increased GFP in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm, using a fluorescent microscope. At least 250 cells from random fields were examined for each experimental condition.Western Blot Analysis—The phosphorylation status of Src, ERK1/2, Akt, and GSK-3β was analyzed by immunoblotting.

PCR was carried out with 20-μl reaction volumes of Gene Expression Assay Mix, TaqMan Universal Master Mix, and 60–80 ng of cDNA template. The PCR reaction was performed in an ABI 7300 Prism. The -fold change in expression was calculated using the ΔΔCt comparative threshold cycle method.Statistical Analysis—The data were analyzed by ANOVA; the Student-Newman-Keuls method was used to estimate the level of significance of differences between means. All experiments shown were repeated at least three times.RESULTSWnts Prevent Apoptosis in C2C12, OB-6, and MC3T3-E1 Cells— Wnt3a abrogated serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis in C2C12 uncommitted osteoblast precursors and OB-6 or MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells as measured by active caspase3 levels (Fig. 1A). Transfection of MC3T3-E1 cells with a plasmid expressing Wnt1, which, similar to Wnt3a, activates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, also prevented apoptosis induced by serum deprivation (Fig. 1B). Further, Wnt3a prevented apoptosis of C2C12 cells when induced by other proapoptotic stimuli, the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide and tumor necrosis factor-α (Fig. 1C).Activation of the Canonical Wnt Signaling Pathway Is Not Sufficient to Mediate the Anti-apoptotic Effects of Wnt3a—To determine whether the canonical Wnt signaling pathway is required for the pro-survival effects of Wnt3a we used the following constructs: (a) DKK1, the secreted antagonist of LRP5 or LRP6; (b) Axin, an intracellular inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling; (c) dnTCF; or (d) S33Y, a β-catenin mutant that accumulates in the nucleus and constitutively activates TCF-mediated transcription. First we confirmed that DKK1, Axin, and dnTCF could inhibit Wnt3a-induced TCF-mediated transcription, whereas constitutively active β-catenin could by itself activate TCF-mediated transcription. For this purpose each one of the mutated constructs was transfected along with a TCF-luciferase reporter plasmid (TOPFLASH) in C2C12 cells (Fig. 2A). C2C12 cells transfected with constitutively active β-catenin were co-transfected either with TOPFLASH or with a negative control plasmid carrying all of the regulatory sequences of TOPFLASH except from the three TCF binding sites (FOPFLASH). As shown in Fig. 2A, in C2C12 cells transfected with an empty vector control plasmid (pcDNA) Wnt3a stimulated luciferase activity from the TCF promoter by 18-fold. The effect of Wnt3a was attenuated in cells transfected wit"

Although the interaction and relationship between these two systems are intriguing and have been studied in different ways since the “pre-clock gene” era, the molecular interaction between them remains largely unknown. Here, we show by systematic molecular biological analysis that acute physical stress elevated only Period1 (Per1) mRNA expression in mouse peripheral organs. Although behavioral rhythms in vivo and peripheral molecular clocks are rather stable against acute restraint stress, the results of a series of promoter analyses, including chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, indicate that a glucocorticoid-responsive element in the Per1 promoter is indispensable for induction of this mRNA both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that Per1 can be a potential stress marker and that a third pathway of Per1 transcriptional control may exist in addition to the clock-regulated CLOCK-BMAL1/E-box and light-responsive cAMP-responsive element-binding protein/cAMP-responsive element pathways.

The hypothalamus in mammals plays an essential role in maintaining homeostasis and has various functions, including hormonal secretion, regulation of vital phenomena, and circadian rhythms. Two systems deeply associated with the hypothalamus, the circadian and stress systems, are necessary for animals to adapt to their environment. The circadian system is responsible for adaptation to predictable aspects of the environment, whereas the stress systems are engaged for adaptation to its unpredictable aspects (1Meerlo P. Sgoifo A. Turek F.W. Stress. 2002; 5: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The circadian system, which governs daily rhythms with periodicities ∼24 h in length, is generally viewed as consisting of three components, i.e. input, oscillator, and output. The input or entrainment signal is most often light, but it can also be other environmental cues, such as temperature, feeding, and social cues. In mammals, the light signals acting on the ganglion cells of the retina are conveyed through the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) 3The abbreviations used are: SCNsuprachiasmatic nucleiCREcAMP-responsive elementCREBcAMP-responsive element-binding proteinLD12-h light/12-h darkRTreverse transcriptionmmouseGREglucocorticoid-responsive elementdGREdistal glucocorticoid-responsive elementpGREproximal glucocorticoid-responsive elementChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationGRglucocorticoid receptorCTcircadian timeZTZeitgeber time. in the anteroventral hypothalamus, which is a major circadian center. As the output, anatomically the SCN projects to at least four different neuronal targets: endocrine neurons, autonomic neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, other hypothalamic structures that transmit the circadian signal to other brain regions, and areas outside the hypothalamus (2Buijs R.M. Kalsbeek A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Physiologically the clock's output drives various phenomena, such as locomotor activity, sleep-wake cycles, and hormonal secretion. Recent competitive and rapidly progressing research has revealed that molecular clocks “tick” not only in the central SCN, but also in peripheral tissues and even in immortalized cells (3Balsalobre A.

In addition, it has been revealed that the molecular mechanisms for circadian rhythms are based on the interlocked autoregulatory feedback loops of transcription of the clock genes (7Dunlap J.C.

Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2004; 5: 407-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Drosophila period mutants were originally discovered more than 3 decades ago (12Konopka R.J. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2112-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). However, more than one-quarter century passed before mammalian period was first identified as Per1 (13Sun Z.S. Albrecht U. Zhuchenko O. Bailey J. Eichele G. Lee C.C.

The expression of all three period genes displays robust circadian rhythms both in the SCN and peripheral tissues (15Takumi T. Taguchi K. Miyake S. Sakakida Y. Takashima N. Matsubara C. Maebayashi Y.

Takumi T. BMC Mol. Biol. 2004; 5: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The transcription of Per1 is activated by binding of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterocomplex, both components of which are bHLH/PAS (basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim) proteins, to the E-boxes in the Per1 promoter (20Gekakis N.

The translated PER1 is post-translationally modified by CK1δ or CK1ϵ (21Vielhaber E. Eide E. Rivers A. Gao Z.H. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell.

This model is now considered to be applicable to other clock or clock-controlled genes. On one hand, the formerly recognized “fos” and the recently discovered “per1” have been identified as molecular markers of entrainment by light. Among mammalian Per genes, Per1 and Per2 mRNAs in the SCN are induced by light, whereas Per3 is not (15Takumi T. Taguchi K. Miyake S. Sakakida Y. Takashima N. Matsubara C. Maebayashi Y. Okumura K. Takekida S. Yamamoto S. Yagita K. Yan L. Young M.W. Okamura H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Per1 induction in the SCN by light is thought to be via cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding proteins (CREB) through CREs in the Per1 promoter (25Travnickova-Bendova Z. Cermakian N. Reppert S.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7728-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 26Tischkau S.A. Mitchell J.W. Tyan S.H. Buchanan G.F. Gillette M.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 718-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The stress response systems are an adaptation to the fact that animals have to deal with unexpected threats and challenges (1Meerlo P. Sgoifo A. Turek F.W. Stress. 2002; 5: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In animals, uncontrollable stressors have been shown to induce changes in a wide variety of behavioral parameters, including decreases in general locomotor activity and explorative behavior as well as impairment of sexual behavior, feeding, and drinking (27Meerlo P. De Boer S.F. Koolhaas J.M. Daan S. Van den Hoofdakker R.H. Physiol. Behav. 1996; 59: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Social stressors can be uncontrollable. Uncontrollable stresses induce classical stress responses via the autonomic sympathoadrenal axis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with an acute and strong neuroendocrine activation. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which mobilizes bodily resources through the release of glucocorticoids, and the autonomic sympathoadrenal axis have been considered to be the main neuroendocrine systems involved in the integrated stress response. Increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity and catecholaminergic activity, both interplaying with various other neuroendocrine systems, orchestrate an adequate response to the unexpected challenge. Various studies on the relationship between stress and circadian rhythms by different kinds of stressors in different species of animals have led to the general idea that the central circadian oscillator appears to be well protected against unpredictable stressful stimuli, but that certain stressors can strongly affect the output of the clock and the expression of the rhythm (1Meerlo P. Sgoifo A. Turek F.W. Stress. 2002; 5: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is well known that serum cortisol levels in humans and rodents show circadian rhythms. However, with fewer studies using mice compared with traditionally chronobiology-preferred animals, such as hamsters and rats, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this classical and intriguing relationship between the circadian and stress systems have remained unclear. Does stress alter the circadian rhythm in mice? Does corticosterone alter circadian rhythms in behavior or gene expression? If stress or corticosterone affects clock gene expression, what is the mechanism? In this study, we systematically examined the temporal expression of mRNAs of clock and clock-related genes in mouse peripheral tissues as well as their behavioral rhythms after an acute restraint stress. Animals—Male ICR (for molecular study) and BALB/c (for behavioral study) mice purchased 5 weeks postpartum from Japan SLC, Inc. (Hamamatsu, Japan) were housed under 12-h light/12-h dark (LD) cycles over 2 weeks. A dark/dark cycle means complete darkness as a continuation of the dark phase of the last LD cycle, and samplings were made in the third dark/dark cycle or later. All protocols using animals in this study were approved by the Osaka Bioscience Institute Animal Research Committee. Sample Preparation—ICR mice were restrained for 1 h in a 31-mm, inner diameter, × 85-mm acryl tube and then housed in individual cages or killed immediately, and peripheral tissues and blood were collected. The peripheral tissues collected were immersed overnight at 4 °C in RNAlater (Ambion, Inc.), and then total RNA was isolated using an SV total RNA isolation system (Promega Corp.). Serum corticosterone concentration was measured with an enzyme immunoassay kit (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI). Behavioral Analysis—After entrainment under the LD conditions (lights on from 8:00 to 20:00), BALB/c mice were housed individually in cages equipped with an infrared locomotor recording apparatus (Biotex, Kyoto, Japan) and maintained under dark/dark cycles as described previously (28Akashi M. Takumi T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To estimate free-running periods, we used a χ2 periodogram (29Sokolove P.G. Bushell W.N. J. Theor. Biol. 1978; 72: 131-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). We estimated periods by using 7 days of data just before and 12 days after the stress-imposed day. To estimate the activity ratio, the average daily activity for 3 days just after the stress-imposed day was divided by that for 10 days just before the stress-imposed day. For resynchronization experiments, LD cycles were advanced 6 h (lights on from 2:00 to 14:00) just after the stress-imposed day. Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—A TaqMan® low density array (Applied Biosystems), which contained mouse (m) Per1, mPer2, mPer3, mArnt1 (mBmal1), mNpas2, mCry1, mCry2, mBhlhb2 (mDec1), mBhlhb3 (mDec2), mDbp, and mNfil3 (mE4bp4) as clock genes and 18 S rRNA as an internal control, was examined using an ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). For one port of the TaqMan low density array, 100 ng of cDNA template was mixed with 50 μl of 2× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and filled up to 100 μl with distilled water. The reaction was first incubated at 50 °C for 2 min at then at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Each quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system as described previously (19Yamamoto T. Nakahata Y. Soma H. Akashi M. Mamine T. Takumi T. BMC Mol. Biol. 2004; 5: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The PCR primers and probes (5′-FAM™ and 3′-TAMRA™) were designed with Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems), and the sequences of the primers and probes were as follows: mPer1 FW, GAA AGA AAC CTC TGG CTG TTC CT; mPer1 RV, GCT GAC GAC GGA TCT TTC TTG; mPer1 TaqMan probe, CCT CAG GTA TTT GGA GAG CTG CAA CAT TCC; mPer2 FW, CGC CTA GAA TCC CTC CTG AGA; mPer2 RV, CCA CCG GCC TGT AGG ATC T; mPer2 TaqMan probe, AGG CTG TGG ATG AAA GGG CGG TC; mBmal1 FW, GCA GTG CCA CTG ACT ACC AAG A; mBmal1 RV, TCC TGG ACA TTG CAT TGC AT; mBmal1 TaqMan probe, ATC AAG AAT GCA AGG GAG GCC CAC A; 18 S rRNA FW, CGC CGC TAG AGG TGA AAT TC; 18 S rRNA RV, CGA ACC TCC GAC TTT CGT TCT; and 18 S rRNA TaqMan probe, CCG GCG CAA GAC GGA CCA GA. For a 25-μl PCR, 50 ng of cDNA template was mixed with the primers and probes to final concentrations of 300 and 2 nm, respectively, and 12.5 μl of 2× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix. The reaction was first incubated at 50 °C for 2 min and then at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Cosine Fitting Curve—To estimate the phase of cycling genes, we prepared curves of 24-h periodicity with phases (b) from 0 to 23 h at intervals of 1 h, yielding a total of 24 model cosine curves, and calculated the correlation coefficient of the cosine curves and cycling genes. For model cosine curves and cycling genes observed over a series of N conditions, a similarity score can be computed as shown in Equations 1 and 2.S(cos,X)=1N∑i=1N(2cos(2π(ti-b)/24)×(Xi-X¯ϕX))(Eq. 1) ϕX=∑i=1N(Xi-X¯)2N(Eq. 2) The values of X̄ are set to the mean of observations on X; ϕX then becomes the standard deviation of X, and S(cos, X) is exactly equal to the Pearson correlation coefficient between the values of cosine wave and observation on X. As for the phase of each gene, from 24 model curves, we selected the phase curve best fit with the highest correlation coefficient. In Silico Search—Computer-aided analysis was performed as described previously (19Yamamoto T. Nakahata Y. Soma H. Akashi M. Mamine T. Takumi T. BMC Mol. Biol. 2004; 5: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Briefly, human, rat, and mouse sequences of Per1 were downloaded from the Celera Data Base System and the NCBI Gene Database. Each Per1 sequence spanning from 9 kb upstream to 4 kb downstream of the transcription start site was obtained. Multiple sequence alignment of these sequences for Per1 was performed using ClustalW Version 1.83 with default parameters. The binding elements were then searched from this alignment using a pattern-finding tool, FUZZNUC (available at bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/fuzznuc.html), with the following consensus sequences allowing for a 1-base mismatch: DBP-binding element, (G/A)T(G/T)A(T/C)GTAA-(T/C); E-box, CACGTG; ROR/REV-ERB element, (A/T)A(A/T)NT-(A/G)GGTCA; and glucocorticoid-responsive element (GRE), AGAACANNNTGTTCT. The accession numbers used and sequence numbers analyzed are as follows: human, NT_010718.14 and c6905708–6891708; rat, rCG34390 and 52960430–52974430; and mouse, NT_039515.2 and 65661216–65676215. mPer1 Promoter Constructs and Transient Reporter Assay—Bacterial artificial chromosome clone RP23–26L6 was purchased from Invitrogen (BACPAC Resource Center at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute). The 6.301-kb region upstream of the translation initiation codon of mPer1 was fused to the luciferase gene in the pGL3-Basic vector (P1F). Deletion constructs P1K and P1S were prepared by removing the region starting at 3.806 and 2.369 kb, respectively, upstream from the translation initiation site of mPer1. The mutant constructs (P1FdM, P1FpM, and P1Fd/pM) for the distal GRE (dGRE) and the proximal GRE (pGRE) were prepared by changing AGA ACA CGA TGT TCC to AGA CAG CGA TGT TCC and GGA ACA TCC TGT TCT to GGA CAG TCC TGT TCT, respectively. NIH3T3 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well 1 day prior to transfection. Transfection was carried out using PolyFect (Qiagen Inc.). 3 h after transfection, dexamethasone (final concentration of 0.1 μm; Sigma) was added to the medium. 27 h after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were assayed with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corp.) using a Turner Designs TD-20/20 luminometer. A Renilla luciferase plasmid was used for cotransfection to normalize each transfection assay. In this study, the cells were cotransfected with 200 ng of the pGL3 firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and 20 ng of the phRL-TK Renilla luciferase internal control plasmid. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were carried out on NIH3T3 cells and mouse liver. We performed ChIP assays on mouse liver as described (available at genomecenter.uc-davis.edu/farnham/protocols/tissues.html) with slight modifications. After sonication to obtain DNA fragments 100–600 bp in length, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the lysates were diluted 1:4 in ChIP dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 167 mm NaCl, 1.1% Triton X-100, and 0.11% sodium deoxycholate supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Nonspecific background was removed by incubating samples with a salmon sperm DNA/protein G-agarose slurry for 4 h at 4 °C with rotation. The samples were centrifuged, and 0.1 volume of the recovered supernatants was stored as an input sample, whereas the rest was incubated overnight with 5 μg of the indicated antibodies at 4 °C with rotation. Antibodies against the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (catalog no. sc-1002) and normal rabbit IgG (catalog no. sc-2027) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The immunocomplexes were collected with 10 μl of protein G-agarose slurry for 4 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were sequentially washed with the following buffers: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate; 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate; and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.25 m LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. Finally, the beads were washed twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA. The immunocomplexes were then eluted by the addition of 200 μl of ChIP direct elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS) and incubated for 4 h at 65°C. The remaining RNAs and proteins were digested by the sequential addition of RNase A (final concentration of 20 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C and proteinase K (final concentration of 50 μg/ml)for 1 h at 55°C. The DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction and ethanol precipitation. For NIH3T3 cells, we slightly modified the above method. Approximately 1 × 106 cells were collected in a 1.5-ml tube and cross-linked by the addition of formaldehyde for 10 min. Following the addition of glycogen to stop cross-linking, the cells were collected by centrifugation and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation, the cell pellets were resuspended in 250 μl of SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 20 min. After sonication, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the lysates were diluted 1:8 in ChIP dilution buffer. The following steps were same as described above for the protocol used for liver samples. The primer sequences for ChIP assays were as follows: dGRE FW, GGG ACC CCC TTC CTC CTA AC; dGRE RV, AGC GCA CTA GGG AAC ATC GT; pGRE FW, CTC GGG AGT CCA TGG GTT T; pGRE RV, CTA GCG CTG AGA ACA GGA TGT TC; Per2 FW, AGC ATC TTC ATT GAG GAA CCC GGG; and Per2 RV, CTC CGC TGT CAC ATA GTG GAA AAC GTG AC. Effect of Restraint Stress on Behavioral Rhythms—We first examined whether acute physical stress influences circadian behavioral rhythms. Mice were subjected to restraint stress during circadian time (CT) 1–2 and CT4–5, when mPer1 was strongly induced as described below (see Fig. 3), and during CT14–15, when mPer1 was least induced (see Fig. 3). The mice showed a clear free-running rhythm of locomotor activity in the dark/dark cycle after 2-week entrainment in the LD cycle (Fig. 1A). The values of the free-running period of activity of the control mice ranged from 22.7 to 24. 1 h (Fig. 1B). The mean free-running period averaged 23.50 ± 0.08 h (n = 20). Some of the stress-imposed mice seemed to show a longer period; however, statistical analyses revealed no significant difference regardless of time when exposed to the acute stress. Daily activity was then compared as the activity ratio, defined as daily activity after treatment divided by that before treatment. No significant difference was found between stress-imposed and control mice regardless of the time treated (Fig. 1C). Mice were subjected to a 6-h advance in the LD cycle after restraint stress, and the number of days to resynchronization of the activity rhythm was counted (Fig. 1D). No significant difference was observed between stress-imposed and control mice. These in vivo behavioral data suggest that mouse circadian clocks behave with variability, but are largely unaffected by a 1-h restraint stress.FIGURE 1Effects of a 1-h restraint stress on behavioral parameters in mice. A, the activity records of BALB/c mice are shown. The light regime consisted of 2 weeks in an LD cycle, followed 24 days in a dark/dark cycle.

C, the daily activities of stress-imposed mice were compared with those of control mice. The activity ratio indicates the daily activity after stress divided by that before stress.

Mice were housed for 2 weeks under the LD conditions and then exposed to a 1-h restraint stress at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 1–2 or ZT14–15. Approximately 12 h after the restraint stress, we started to collect samples of peripheral tissues every 3 h and examined the temporal expression of mPer1, mPer2, and mBmal1 mRNAs by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Data on temporal expression of mPer1, mPer2, and mBmal1 mRNAs, which were obtained from each sample for stress ending at ZT2 and ZT15, together with controls, were plotted for three different tissues, i.e. liver, heart, and kidney (Fig. 2, A–C, respectively). As seen in behavioral rhythms in vivo, interindividual variability was observed, especially in the stress-imposed groups. We applied a “cosine fitting curve method” to objectively simulate the circadian curve and to estimate the peak time of cycling clock genes. Cosine curves demonstrating the highest scores in the Pearson correlation coefficient were accepted as the fittest cosine curves of cycling clock genes. The peak times and Pearson correlation coefficients in the liver obtained by this cosine fitting curve method were ZT13 and 0.82 (Fig. 2A, panel a), ZT13 and 0.81 (panel b), ZT13 and 0.74 (panel c), ZT14 and 0.76 (panel d), ZT14 and 0.87 (panel e), ZT14 and 0.69 (panel f), ZT0 and 0.84 (panel f), ZT0 and 0.83 (panel h), and ZT0 and 0.85 (panel i), respectively. The peak times of these three genes according to this simulation were likely to be the same and were not affected by the 1-h restraint stress ending at either ZT2 or ZT15. We also obtained similar results for the heart and kidney (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively). The peak times and correlation coefficients were ZT11 and 0.71 (Fig. 2B, panel a), ZT13 and 0.74 (panel b), ZT14 and 0.68 (panel c), ZT14 and 0.86 (panel d), ZT14 and 0.78 (panel e), ZT14 and 0.87 (panel f), ZT12 and 0.82 (Fig. 2C, panel a), ZT13 and 0.72 (panel b), ZT12 and 0.80 (panel c), ZT14 and 0.87 (panel d), ZT14 and 0.72 (panel e), and ZT14 and 0.84 (panel f), respectively. The peak times of mPer1 (ZT2 and ZT15) in the heart and mPer2 (ZT2) in the kidney were delayed compared with those in the controls; however, the Pearson correlation coefficient was relatively small. Although phase shifts of even 1 h or so would indeed be undetectable, these results argue that, against a 1-h restraint stress, peripheral molecular clocks are rather stable. Restraint Stress Induces mRNA Expression of mPer1, but Not That of Other Clock Genes in Mouse Peripheral Tissues—To ascertain whether acute physical stress influences circadian clocks at the molecular level, we subjected mice to restraint stress for 1 h every 4 h in 1 dayand then examined transcripts in their peripheral tissues sampled after stress treatment by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Fig. 3A shows the mRNA expression levels of canonical clock genes (mPer1, mPer2, mPer3, mBmal1, mNpas2, mCry1, mCry2, mDec1, mDec2, mDbp, and mE4bp4) in mouse liver after 1 h of restraint stress. The circadian patterns of controls were consist"
https://openalex.org/W2038009022,"ROCK or Rho-associated kinase, a serine/threonine kinase, is an effector of Rho-dependent signaling and is involved in actin-cytoskeleton assembly and cell motility and contraction. The ROCK protein consists of several domains: an N-terminal region, a kinase catalytic domain, a coiled-coil domain containing a RhoA binding site, and a pleckstrin homology domain. The C-terminal region of ROCK binds to and inhibits the kinase catalytic domains, and this inhibition is reversed by binding RhoA, a small GTPase. Here we present the structure of the N-terminal region and the kinase domain. In our structure, two N-terminal regions interact to form a dimerization domain linking two kinase domains together. This spatial arrangement presents the kinase active sites and regulatory sequences on a common face affording the possibility of both kinases simultaneously interacting with a dimeric inhibitory domain or with a dimeric substrate. The kinase domain adopts a catalytically competent conformation; however, no phosphorylation of active site residues is observed in the structure. We also determined the structures of ROCK bound to four different ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitors (Y-27632, fasudil, hydroxyfasudil, and H-1152P). Each of these compounds binds with reduced affinity to cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA), a highly homologous kinase. Subtle differences exist between the ROCK- and PKA-bound conformations of the inhibitors that suggest that interactions with a single amino acid of the active site (Ala215 in ROCK and Thr183 in PKA) determine the relative selectivity of these compounds. Hydroxyfasudil, a metabolite of fasudil, may be selective for ROCK over PKA through a reversed binding orientation.

Protein phosphorylation is one of the major posttranslational modifications required for regulation of cellular activities, and kinases that catalyze these reactions are one of the largest families of enzymes in eukaryotic cells. Disruption of a kinase activity, either through mutation or deregulation, can have profound consequences on the functioning of a cell, leading to a wide variety of disease states. Further, because kinases play a regulatory role in pathways involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control, modulation of kinase activity presents an opportunity for therapeutic intervention. One such kinase is ROCK (Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase; reviewed in Ref. 1Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar), a Ser/Thr kinase with potential roles in several therapeutic indications including hypertension (2Mukai Y. Shimokawa H. Matoba T.

Because desired therapeutic outcomes would likely result from a reduction of ROCK activity, much research has focused on designing small molecule inhibitors of ROCK. There are two isoforms of ROCK, known as ROCK I and II, or Rho-kinase β and α, respectively (5Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two kinases regulate the activity of muscle myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) 2The abbreviations used are: RLCregulatory light chainPKAcAMP-dependent kinaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.2The abbreviations used are: RLCregulatory light chainPKAcAMP-dependent kinaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. proteins by direct phosphorylation, (6Amano M.

This leads to increased levels of phosphorylated myosin light chain and subsequent muscle contraction (8Kureishi Y. Kobayashi S. Amano M. Kimura K. Kanaide H. Nakano T. Kaibuchi K. Ito M. J. Biol.

The Rho/ROCK pathway is also involved in nonmuscle myosin regulation and has been implicated in stress fiber and focal adhesion formation (9Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N.

ROCK is composed of a catalytic kinase domain (residues 73–405), a coiled-coil region (residues 425–1100), and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain (residues 1103–1230). A similar domain organization is shared with three closely related kinases: myotonic dystrophy kinase (DMPK) (12Bush E.W. Helmke S.M. Birnbaum R.A. Perryman M.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8480-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase (MRCK) (13Tan I. Seow K.T. Lim L. Leung T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and citron kinase (CRIK) (14Di Cunto F. Calautti E. Hsiao J. Ong L. Topley G. Turco E. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29706-29711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The work described herein represents the first structure of a DMPK family member. Full-length ROCK, in the absence of effector molecules, exists as an autoinhibited structure. The C-terminal region of ROCK (coiled-coil and pleckstrin homology domains) has been shown to partially inhibit the kinase catalytic activity by binding directly to the kinase domain (15Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Kaneko T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32418-32424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). When GTP-bound RhoA binds to the Rho-binding region of the coiled-coil domain, the interactions between the catalytic kinase domain and the C-terminal region are disrupted, relieving the inhibition (16Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Kakizuka A. Morii N. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the C-terminal inhibitory domain from the catalytic domain by caspase-3 during apoptosis also activates the enzyme (17Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A. Olson M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 18Sebbagh M. Renvoize C. Hamelin J. Riche N. Bertoglio J. Breard J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized the oligomerization state of full-length ROCK and four truncated constructs using light scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation methods (19Doran J.D. Liu X. Taslimi P. Saadat A. Fox T. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Protein constructs containing residues 6–415 exist as dimers, whereas smaller constructs are predominantly monomeric. ROCK (6–415) proved to be highly homogenous in solution and yielded diffraction quality crystals suitable for x-ray structure determination. This construct lacks the C-terminal inhibitory domains and is similar to the caspase-3-activated form of ROCK. An analogous form of truncated CRIK has also been observed in vivo (14Di Cunto F. Calautti E. Hsiao J. Ong L. Topley G. Turco E. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29706-29711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Here we report the x-ray crystal structure of ROCK bound to ATP-competitive inhibitors. The structure reveals two kinase domains linked by an N-terminal dimerization domain comprised of five α-helices from each monomer. In this arrangement, the active sites of the two kinases share a common face, possibly facilitating interactions with dimeric substrates or inhibitory domains. Each kinase domain appears to be have a catalytically competent conformation in the absence of phosphorylation. In full-length ROCK, interactions with the C-terminal domains may change this arrangement of the kinase domains or alter the structure of a regulatory element such as the activation loop. Crystal structures of four ROCK protein-ligand complexes were determined containing the inhibitors Y-27632, fasudil (HA-1077), hydroxyfasudil (HA-1100), and a dimethylated analog of fasudil (H-1152P). Y-27632 is a pyridine compound that is chemically distinct from the other three isoquinoline based ligands. In a prior study, Breitenlechner et al. (20Breitenlechner C. Gassel M. Hidaka H. Kinzel V. Huber R. Engh R.A. Bossemeyer D. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1595-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) determined the structures of Y-27632, fasudil, and H-1152P bound to PKA. To allow comparisons among all four ligands in both ROCK and PKA, we also determined the structure of PKA bound to hydroxyfasudil. All four compounds are competitive inhibitors at the ATP binding site. Several previous studies have established that Y-27632 is a selective inhibitor of ROCK, and it is used to assess the effects of ROCK inhibition in a variety of cellular and animal models (4Ohki S.

Fasudil, a vasodilator used for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm, is an approved drug whose mechanism of action is believed to stem from ROCK inhibition (24Masaoka H. Takasato Y. Nojiri T.

Neuropharmacol. 1993; 16: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Hydroxyfasudil, first identified as a metabolite of fasudil (27Shibuya M. Suzuki Y. Sugita K. Saito I. Sasaki T. Takakura K. Nagata I. Kikuchi H. Takemae T. Hidaka H. Nakashima M. J. Neurosurg. 1992; 76: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), is a more selective inhibitor of ROCK compared with its parent. The dimethylated analog of fasudil, H-1152P, is the most potent inhibitor of the four ligands toward ROCK by 2 orders of magnitude (28Sasaki Y. Suzuki M. Hidaka H. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 93: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Comparison of these four ROCK ligand structures both among themselves and against their corresponding counterparts in PKA suggests that a very specific active site contact is important for selective ROCK inhibition. Cloning and Expression—Rock I (Swiss-Prot code Q13464) was isolated from a human leukocyte cDNA library. The cDNA encoding the ROCK protein comprising residues 6–553 and 6–415 were cloned into a baculoviral transfer vector, pBEV10, and expressed in insect cells as described (29Chambers S.P. Austen D.A. Fulghum J.R. Kim W.M. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 36: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The proteins were engineered to include a hexahistidine tag (His6) at the N terminus to facilitate purification. Protein Purification—The protein used for crystallization was first produced by proteolytic cleavage of a larger construct and later through construction of a DNA expression vector containing sequences corresponding to the desired proteolytic product. The ROCK Ser6–Leu553 construct was metal affinity-purified as described (19Doran J.D. Liu X. Taslimi P. Saadat A. Fox T. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After thrombin cleavage of the His tag, the sample was treated with clostripain (Washington Chemicals) at a ratio of 1:100 (w/w) and 10 mm CaCl2 for 3 h at room temperature followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. This yielded a C-terminal truncation whose limits were determined to be 6–415 by N-terminal sequencing (Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencing System) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE STR Biospectrometry work station). The protein was then diluted 10-fold with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, loaded onto a MonoQ HR 5/5 ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with a 100–400 mm NaCl gradient over 40 column volumes. The sample was then loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The main peak was pooled and appeared to be 99% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. The ROCK 6–415 construct was purified using an identical procedure except that the clostripain proteolysis step was no longer required. Ligand Inhibition Measurements—The inhibition constant, Ki, for inhibiting PKA and ROCK were obtained from dose-response titration curves. The residual enzyme activity remaining was determined by the spectrophotometric coupled enzyme assay as previously described (30Fox T. Coll J.T. Xie X. Ford P.J. Germann U.A. Porter M.D. Pazhanisamy S. Fleming M.A. Galullo V. Su M.S. Wilson K.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2249-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In this assay, every mole of ADP generated in the kinase reaction is coupled to the generation of NAD from NADH using pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The final concentration of the assay components were as follows: 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 200 μm NADH, 2.5% Me2SO, 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 10 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase. The ATP and peptide concentrations were 10 and 15 μm (LRRASLG) for PKA and 15 μm and 45 μm (KKRNRTLSV) for ROCK I assays, respectively. Assay plates were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and the absorbance change at 340 nm was monitored (Table 1).TABLE 1Inhibition constants determined for ROCK and PKA Open table in a new tab Crystallization and X-ray Analysis—ROCK crystals were grown by the vapor diffusion method at 22 °C. Equal volumes of protein stock solution (20 mg/ml protein, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and well solution (3–8% polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mm MES, pH 5.5, 50 mm CaCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol) were mixed and suspended over 1 ml of well solution. Over 4 days, the crystals reached a final size of ∼200 μm. The crystals were harvested and flashfrozen in a solution composed of the well solution with 25–30% (v/v) glycerol. The Y-27632 (BIOMOL International L.P.) complex with ROCK was made by adding the ligand (2 mm) to the clostripain treated 6–553 construct prior to crystallization. Subsequent complexes with fasudil (Toronto Research Chemicals), hydroxyfasudil (prepared as in Ref. 31Hidaka, H., and Sone, T., Patent 4,678,783, pp. 1-21, Asahi Kasei Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha, JapanGoogle Scholar), and H-1152P (Calbiochem) were made by soaking unliganded crystals (ROCK 6–415) with 500 μm compound and 5% Me2SO (final concentration) for 48 h at room temperature. The Y-27632/ROCK diffraction data were recorded at the COMCAT (32-ID) Beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratories and Emerald Biosciences). All other diffraction data were recorded at Beamline 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories). Intensities were integrated and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (32Otwinoski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38526) Google Scholar) and CrystalClear (33CrystalClear: An Integrated Program for the Collection and Processing of Area Detector Data. Rigaku/MSC, The Woodlands, TX1997–2002Google Scholar). The structure was determined by molecular replacement using homology models based upon PKA (Protein Data Bank code 1ATP). The molecular replacement solution was determined using AMORE (34Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The crystals belong to the space group P3121. The asymmetric unit consists of two monomers that are well ordered. The asymmetric unit also contains the N-terminal region of a third molecule that interacts with a symmetry-related molecule across a 2-fold axis. The electron density for this region is quite poor, and the remainder of the molecule (kinase domain) is not visible at all. The protein model was built using QUANTA and refined with CNX (Accelrys) (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

Two Kinase Domains Interact via a Dimerization Domain—The protein used in this study consists of the N-terminal region comprising approximately one-third of the full-length sequence of ROCK. The crystal structure reveals two protein molecules in a head-to-head arrangement, related by a pseudo-2-fold rotation noncrystallographic symmetry (Fig. 1A). Each monomer consists of an N-terminal helical domain (residues 5–72), a bilobed kinase domain (residues 73–356), and a kinase tail (residues 357–405). Helices from the two N-terminal domains interact with each other to form a single structure (Fig. 1, B and D). This region will be referred to hereafter as the dimerization domain. The kinase tail of each molecule lies across its own kinase domain and interacts with the dimerization domain. The kinase domain of ROCK has a global fold typical of serine/threonine kinases, consisting of two lobes linked by a hinge region. The smaller, N-terminal lobe (residues 73–153) contains a twisted five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet and a single α-helix. The C-terminal lobe (residues 159–356) is largely α-helical. The ATP-binding pocket of the active site is formed by a groove at the interface between these two domains and is enclosed by the hinge region (residues 154–158), the glycine-rich loop (residues 81–91), and the activation loop (residues 216–231). The ROCK kinase domain structure was compared with PKA, the most similar kinase with respect to sequence identity for which the three-dimensional structure is known. When secondary structural elements are aligned, a root mean square difference of 1.3 Å for C-α atom positions was observed between ROCK and PKA (Protein Data Bank code 1ATP) (using 220 residues) (38Zheng J. Knighton D.R. ten Eyck L.F. Karlsson R. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The N-terminal helices and the kinase tail of each monomer in the asymmetric unit interact over an extensive interface to form a dimer. The dimerization domain is made from two sets of five helices, one set from each protein monomer, and part of the kinase tail from each monomer (residues 383–405). The kinase tail lies roughly parallel to helix 2 and packs between its own kinase domain and helix 2 and also helix 4 of the noncrystallographic symmetry-related monomer (Fig. 1). Most of the contact surface area is comprised of the helices of one chain interacting with the helices of the other monomer. The two kinase tails do not interact with each other except via contacts between Phe387 on each chain. The extensive interface between the two chains is largely hydrophobic and buries ∼4120 Å2 solvent-accessible surface area/dimer. For comparison, the buried surface area in complexes between a protein antigen and an antibody are typically less than 2000 Å2 (39Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). These dimer interactions orient the two monomers such that the active sites and regulatory elements of the kinase domains appear on a single face of the dimer (Fig. 1B). Active Conformation Independent of Phosphorylation—ROCK is activated by disrupting the interactions between the kinase domain and regulatory elements in the C terminus, either through RhoA binding or cleavage of the C terminus by caspase-3. Because the crystallization construct lacks these inhibitory C-terminal domains, we would expect to observe a catalytically competent conformation. In particular, the residues of the active site should be aligned as in other catalytically active kinase structures, and the activation loop should not occlude the peptide substrate binding groove. The catalytic residues of the kinase domain were compared with the PKA structure to determine whether the ROCK structure represents a catalytically active conformation (40Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). The positions and side chain rotamers of the catalytic residues resemble those observed in the phosphorylated PKA-ATP-peptide complex (Protein Data Bank code 1ATP). In PKA, Asn171 forms a hydrogen bond to and thus orients Asp166, which in turn forms a hydrogen bond with the Ser or Thr hydroxyl group of the substrate at the site of phosphorylation. The corresponding residues in ROCK, Asn203 and Asp198, have the same position and side chain conformations. Likewise, the residues of PKA that interact with the ATP phosphates and Mg2+ atoms (Lys72, Asn171, and Asp184) are conserved both in sequence and position in ROCK (Lys105, Asn203, and Asp216) (Fig. 2). An ion pair between the active site lysine and a glutamate on the C-helix is a conserved feature of catalytically active kinase conformations. As in the active conformation of PKA, the salt bridge in ROCK between Glu124 and Lys105 is intact. Among protein kinases, the conformation of the activation loop varies widely (reviewed in Ref. 41Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). In inactive kinase conformations, the activation loop often blocks the active site, interfering with peptide and ATP substrate binding. In active kinases, this loop lies parallel to helices E and F, and the active site is accessible. Although the sequence and conformation of the activation loop vary among active kinase conformations, they all share the same global conformation. In the ROCK structure, even though no phosphorylation is observed in the structure, the position of the activation loop resembles an active conformation. The activation loops of the two ROCK molecules in the asymmetric unit are very similar (0.3 Å root mean square difference over main chain atoms), diverging only at the region between the activation loop and the EF helix (Asp232–Pro238), where each of the two monomers makes different crystal lattice contacts. In this region, one ROCK monomer (chain A) most closely resembles the corresponding region in PKA, whereas these residues in the other monomer (chain B) move away from the active site by about 5 Å. These two different conformations indicate that these loop regions are likely to be flexible. In many kinases, a catalytically competent conformation is stabilized by interactions with a phosphorylated residue on the activation loop. In the ROCK structure no phosphorylation is observed in the electron density map. Furthermore, the residues that typically interact with the phosphate group are not conserved in ROCK. In PKA for example, the active conformation of the loop is stabilized by interactions between a phosphothreonine (Thr197) and three basic residues (His87, Arg165, and Lys189) and one polar residue (Thr195). In ROCK, the corresponding residue (Thr233) appears unmodified and lies about 4 Å outside the active site relative to PKA. Also three of the four corresponding residues that are in a position to interact with the phosphothreonine in ROCK are hydrophobic (Phe120, Met221, and Cys231) (Fig. 3). In the absence of interactions with a phosphorylated residue, we would expect other interactions to stabilize the loop conformation. Indeed, the interactions between the activation loop and the αEF/αF loop are more extensive in ROCK than in PKA. Both the αEF/αF loop and the activation loop are each four residues longer than the corresponding sequences in PKA (Fig. 2). These insertions almost double the buried surface between the two"

This activity is mediated by the LXCXE motif and the CR3 zinc binding domain of the E7 protein. In this study we report the x-ray crystal structure of the CR3 region of HPV E7 and a structure-based mutational analysis to investigate its mode of pRb and E2F binding and E2F displacement from pRb. The structure reveals a novel zinc-bound E7-CR3 obligate homodimer that contains two surface patches of sequence conservation. Mutation of residues within these patches reveals that one patch is required for pRb binding, whereas the other is required for E2F binding. We also show that both E7-mediated interactions are required to disrupt pRb·E2F complexes. Based on these studies we present a mechanistic model for how E7 displaces E2F from pRb. Because the CR3 region of HPV E7 has no detectable homology to other human proteins, the structure-function studies presented here provide an avenue for developing small molecule compounds that inhibit HPV-E7-mediated cell transformation.

Yee C.L. Munger K. Howley P.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 539-547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The CR2 and CR3 regions of HPV E7 share sequence homology with the corresponding regions of adenovirus E1A and SV40 large T antigen, including a strictly conserved LXCXE motif that mediates high affinity binding to pRb (13Dyson N.

The CR3 region of E7 contains two CXXC motifs that are separated by 29 or 30 residues, forming a novel zinc binding domain (3Shah K.V. Howley P.M. Fields Virology.

The E7 CR3 region also mediates inactivation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27 and p21 (19Funk J.O. Waga S. Harry J.B. Espling E. Stillman B. Galloway D.A.

A major cellular target for HPV-E7 and other viral oncoproteins in cell transformation is the pRb tumor suppressor. pRb represents a family of closely related proteins, including p107 and p130 that bind to E2F transcription factors and block their transcriptional activation function (25Stevaux O. Dyson N.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 26Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Curr. Opin.

Phosphorylation of pRb by cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase results in the dissociation of pRb·E2F complexes and the transcriptional activation of E2F-regulated S-phase genes (28Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Santi A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). pRb binding by viral oncoproteins SV40 large T antigen, adenovirus E1A, and HPV E7 results in the misregulated release of E2F transcription factors and the activation of S-phase genes. pRb contains pocket domain A and B and a C-terminal domain harboring target sites for cell cycle-dependent post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation (29Chan H.M. Krstic-Demonacos M. Smith L. Demonacos C. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Although the A-B pocket of pRb contains a high affinity binding site for the E2F transactivation domain, the C-terminal pRb domain also contains a lower affinity binding site for other E2F regions, and the site of pRb interaction has been mapped roughly to a region that overlaps the HPV E7 CR3 binding site (18Patrick D.R. Oliff A. Heimbrook D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6842-6850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Qin X.Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the A-B pocket of pRb in complex with peptides derived from either the high affinity E7 LXCXE peptide or a E2F 18-residue activation domain peptide show that, whereas the E2F peptide binds to the cleft formed by the A/B interface, the E7 peptide binds to the B domain nearly 30 Å away. These findings are consistent with in vivo and in vitro studies showing that LXCXE peptides cannot displace E2F from pRb (31Huang P.S. Patrick D.R. Edwards G. Goodhart P.J. Huber H.E. Miles L.

Virol. 1993; 67: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and isothermal titration calorimetry studies showing that the two peptides bind to pRb independently (33Xiao B. Spencer J. Clements A. Ali-Khan N. Mittnacht S. Broceno C. Burghammer M. Perrakis A. Marmorstein R. Gamblin S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2363-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 34Lee J.O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 391: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Moreover, these studies are consistent with observations that the E7 CR3 region cooperates with the CR2 region for E2F displacement from pRb (18Patrick D.R. Oliff A. Heimbrook D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6842-6850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequent cell transformation, although the mechanism for this is not clear. Despite the large number of biological activities that map to the CR3 region of HPV-E7 as well as its related region within HPV-E6, this domain has previously resisted detailed structural and mechanistic analysis. In this study we now report on the high resolution x-ray crystal structure of the CR3 region of E7 from genotype 1A of HPV and use structure-based mutagenesis to dissect how the protein disrupts pRb·E2F complexes to mediate cell transformation. Protein Expression and Purification for Crystallization—DNA fragments encoding residues 44–93 of native type 1A HPV E7 (HPV 1A E7-(44–93)) protein preceded by DNA encoding an MK sequence was cloned into the pRSET A vector for protein overexpression in Escherichia coli cells BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C, and when the A595 nm reached 0.5, 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 100 μm zinc acetate were added to the media, and the cells were grown for 3 additional hours before they were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 20 min to isolate the cell pellet that was stored at -70 °C before protein purification. Frozen cell pellets were suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm sodium chloride, 10 μm zinc acetate, and 10 mm dithiothreitol and lysed by sonication. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min, and the insoluble fraction containing the HPV 1AE7-(44–93) was solubilized in 20 mm Ches, pH 10.15, 100 mm sodium chloride, 50 μm zinc acetate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 6 m guanidine-HCl denaturant. This HPV 1AE7-(44–93) denaturant solution was dialyzed against the same buffer without guanidinium-HCl overnight followed by a 4-h dialysis against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium chloride, 10 μm zinc acetate, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The solution containing the refolded HPV 1AE7-(44–93) protein was centrifuged to remove precipitates formed during the refolding process, and the supernatant was then applied to a pre-equilibrated ion exchange Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The flow-through from the Q-Sepharose column, harboring the HPV 1AE7-(44–93) protein, was collected, concentrated (Millipore), and loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). Peak fractions containing HPV 1AE7-(44–93) were judged to be greater than 95% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis with a typical yield of 100 mg of recombinant protein from 12 liters of growth culture. For the preparation of selenium-derivatized protein, base substitution encoding a single L76M mutation was introduced into the above construct by mutagenesis (QuikChange mutagenesis kit, Stratagene), and protein overexpression was carried out in the methionine auxotrophic E. coli cells B834 (DE3) (Novagen). B834 (DE3) cells were grown in selenomethionine-containing minimal media supplemented with the other 19 amino acids (35Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Selenomethionine-derivatized protein was purified essentially as described for the wild-type construct with similar yield. Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Crystals of HPV 1AE7-(44–93) were obtained by mixing 2 μl of 6 mg/ml protein in a buffer containing 100 mm Ches, pH 10.15, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.5, 200 mm MgCl2, and 2.2 m sodium chloride and equilibrating over reservoir solution at 20 °C. Both native and selenium-derivatized crystals grew to a typical size of 300 × 80 × 80 μm3 after 2 days. The crystals were cryoprotected by transferring them to a reservoir solution supplemented with 50% saturated sucrose solution. Only the selenomethionine-derivatized crystals produced useful diffraction after cryoprotection and, therefore, were the only crystals used for data collection, structure determination, and refinement. Complete three-wavelength (peak, inflection, and remote) Zn-MAD (50–2.3Å) and Se-MAD (50–3.5 Å) data were collected from the selenium-derivatized crystals on beamline 19ID at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratories) using a 3 × 3 mosaic CCD detector at 100 K. The data were processed and scaled using HKL2000 suite (HKL Research). The space group was determined to be P21212 with two molecules in one asymmetric unit. The structure of HPV 1AE7-(44–93) was solved by Zn-MAD. The two zinc positions per 2 protein subunits in the asymmetric unit dimer were located and refined with the program SOLVE (36Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), yielding an initial figure of merit of 0.60. The initial experimental map was of excellent quality, facilitating the building of a partial model automatically with the program RESOLVE (37Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

PGex6P-1-E2F1-(243–437) was kindly provided by Dr. Steven Gamblin (MRC, Mill Hill, UK). All site-directed E7 and pRb mutations employed the QuikChange mutagenesis kit essentially as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene). GST-E7 and GST-E2F1-(243–437) fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus RIL cells (Novagen), and His-pRb proteins were produced in BL21 (520) cells. Purified GST-E2F1-(243–437) was subject to digestion with Prescission Protease (Amersham Bioscience) to produce an untagged E2F1-(243–437) protein for further studies. GST- and His-tagged proteins were purified as described by the manufacturers (Novagen and Qiagen, respectively). GST pull-down assays were carried out by mixing 30 μg of GST-E7 fusion protein in a batch with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) that were pre-equilibrated with the binding buffer 1× PBS, pH 7.4, 100 mm sodium chloride, 5 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% TWEEN 20. Equivalent molar amounts of either pRb or E2F1 protein were then added to the GST-E7 equilibrated beads in a total volume of 350 μl, and the protein/bead mixture was further equilibrated at 4 °C for 1 h accompanied by gentle mixing. Protein not bound to the glutathione beads was removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 3 min, and the beads were washed 2 times with 1 ml of binding buffer. The beads were resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-loading dye and boiled for 5 min. Samples were analyzed on 12% PAGE Duramide gels (Cambrex) followed by either Coomassie Blue staining for pRb proteins or for E2F1 protein using Western analysis with anti-E2F1 antibody (Genetex) for E2F1-(243–437). E2F Displacement Assays—10 μg of His-pRb-(376–928) was pre-mixed with equivalent molar amounts of non-tagged E2F1-(243–437) and added to 30 μl of pre-equilibrated nickel nitrilotriacetic acid beads in a total volume of 200 μl of binding buffer containing 1× PBS, pH 7.4, 100 mm sodium chloride, 5 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Tween 20 for further equilibration at 4 °C for 30 min. Increasing molar amounts of GST-E7-E/D-CR3 (10-, 20-, 30-, and 50-fold excess) or untagged E7-CR2/CR3 (1-, 2-, and 5-fold excess) relative to His-pRB input was added to the beads with bound His-pRB-E2F1 complex to a final volume of 350 μl for each displacement reaction. The reaction mixtures were mixed at 4 °C for an additional 1 h. Protein not bound to the glutathione beads was removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 3 min, and the beads were washed 2 times with 1 ml of binding buffer before analysis of the protein-bound beads on SDS-PAGE as described above. Overall Structure of HPV E7-CR3—The recombinant HPV 1AE7 CR3 region (residues 44–93; Fig. 1A) was prepared from bacteria and crystallized in space group P21212. The crystal structure was determined using MAD from the two bound zinc atoms per asymmetric unit and refined to a resolution of 1.6 Å, with excellent crystallographic statistics and protein geometry (Table 1). The E7 CR3 domain assembles as a roughly globular and obligate dimer of approximate dimensions 30 Å × 20 Å × 25 Å (Fig. 1B). Each subunit of the dimer contains a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet formed by residues 44–52 (β1) and 58–65 (β2) followed by a sharp U-turn leading to helix α1 (residues 67–79) that sits on one side of the sheet with its axis roughly parallel to the sheet. From the α1 helix, a 90-degree bend leads to β3 (residues 81–83) followed by an extended strand that cuts across the β1-β2 sheet and leads to a final short α2 helix (residues 89–91). The α2 helix sits on the opposite side of the β1-β2 sheet relative to the α1 helix. A structural zinc ion is coordinated by four cysteines residues; two from the hairpin loop between β1 and β2 strands, one from the loop connecting the α1 and α2 helices, and one from the α2 helix (Fig. 1B). The dimer is formed by the face-to-face dyad-related packing of the two subunit β1-β2-α1 faces and β-sheet interactions between β2 and β3 strands of opposing subunits. Superposition of either the E7-CR3 monomer or dimer structure against a structure database using the Dali server (www.ebi.ac.uk/dali/index.html) identifies no structures with Z-scores over 2.8 (less than 2.0 is considered dissimilar). Analysis of the structures with Z scores between 2.0 and 2.8 reveals that none of them bind zinc or form homodimers and the structural homology is primarily restricted to the β1-β2-α1 region of the monomer. Based on this, we conclude that the structure of the E7-CR3 described here represents a novel zinc binding fold. A sequence alignment of E7 proteins shows a high degree of sequence conservation within the CR3 region with greater than 40% identity and 60% homology between proteins, suggesting that all E7-CR3 regions adopt the same dimeric structure (Figs. 1, A and B). The E7-CR3 Dimer Interface—The E7-CR3 dimer interface appears to be maintained in large part by a hydrophobic core that buries a total solvent-accessible area of 2058 Å2 (Fig. 2A). A sequence alignment of the CR3 domains from E7 proteins shows that, of the residues that stabilize the core, five residues are strictly conserved, and three show high conservation. Residues that contribute to this dimer-induced core include dyad-related interactions from Val-48 from β1, Val-59, Leu-61, and Val-63 from β2, Leu-73, Met-76, and Leu-77 from α1, and Leu-81 and Ile-83 from β3. The carbonyl oxygens of Thr-62 and Leu-64 from one protomer make main chain hydrogen bonds to the amide groups of Asn-82 and Val-84 from the other protomer, and the amide groups of Leu-64 and Asp-66 from one protomer make hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygens of Ser-80 and Asn-82 from the other protomer. An additional hydrogen bond is formed between the side chain of Gln-72 and the side chain of Met-76 from the other protomer. Finally, β3 from one protomer makes anti-parallel β-strand interactions with the end of β2 of the other subunit. Taken together, it would appear that the E7-CR3 domain would not be able to maintain this tertiary structure in monomeric form or in the absence of zinc coordination and is, therefore, likely to be an obligate and zinc-dependent dimer. This is consistent with solution studies showing that HPV-E7 undergoes a monomer-dimer equilibrium with a dissociation constant of about 1 μm (16Clements A. Johnston K. Mazzarelli J.M. Ricciardi R.P. Marmorstein R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16033-16045Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Surface Features of E7-CR3—In an effort to identify regions of the E7 CR3 domain that may mediate interaction with pRb and other E7-CR3-interacting proteins, we mapped HPV E7 conserved residues onto the surface of the HPV 1AE7-CR3 dimeric structure (Fig. 3A). This analysis reveals two conserved surface patches that are implicated as contact sites. One surface patch maps to the outer edges of the two α1 helices of the dimer. Residues defining these edges, Ile-70, Arg-71, Glu-74, Glu-75, and Leu-78 of the α1 helix show a high degree of conservation among E7 proteins from different HPV genotypes. A second conserved patch maps to the β1 strands within a pronounced groove at the dimer interface (Fig. 3A). Specifically, residues Arg-60 and Leu-61 in this region are highly conserved among the E7 proteins. Interestingly, an electrostatic surface map of the HPV 1AE7 CR3 domain reveals that the regions around the α1 helix (patch 1) and β1 strand (patch 2) harbor the most electronegative and electropositive surfaces of the protein, respectively (Fig. 3B). Based on the E7 sequence alignment, the structural features are likely to be conserved among the E7 proteins. This observation suggests that if the α1 and β1 regions of the CR3 domain of E7 do indeed mediate protein contact, this contact likely involves an electrostatic component. Mutational Analysis of E7-CR3 to Probe pRb Interactions—Previous studies have shown that the E7 CR3 region mediates interactions to both pRb and E2F (18Patrick D.R. Oliff A. Heimbrook D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6842-6850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hwang S.G. Lee D. Kim J. Seo T. Choe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2923-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To confirm that the CR3 region used for structure determination in this study is sufficient for pRb binding, we prepared GST-tagged 1AE7-(44–93) (called GST-1AE7-CR3) for use in a GST pull-down assay with pRb, employing a pRb construct containing the A and B domains as well as region C (hereafter, pRbABC, residues 376–928 of pRb). As shown in Fig. 4A, GST-1AE7-CR3 specifically pulls down pRb, whereas the GST control fails to do so. In light of the structure of HPV 1AE7-CR3 and the noted conservation of solvent-exposed residues in the α1 helix (patch 1) and β1 strand (patch 2), we first tested the hypothesis that these patches might mediate the interaction with pRb. For this analysis we prepared a series of site-directed mutations of HPV-E7-conserved residues within the α1 and β1 strand within genotypes 1A and 16 of GST-tagged HPV E7 proteins and compared their affinity for pRb using a GST pull-down assay. The GST-E7 fusion proteins used for these studies did not include the high affinity LXCXE-mediated protein binding motif within CR2 so that LXCXE-protein binding would not mask CR3-mediated protein binding, as the presence of the CR2 within the HPV protein increases its pRb affinity"

https://openalex.org/W2065735233,"The genomic DNA profiles of prostate cancers with aggressive features were compared to the profiles of matched normal DNA to identify genes that are selectively amplified in the cancer cells. One of the identified genes, MCM7, which is a component of the DNA replication licensing complex, has been studied extensively both at the DNA and protein levels in human prostate tissues. Approximately half of the prostate cancer specimens studied showed MCM7 gene amplification, and 60% of the aggressive prostate cancer specimens had increased MCM7 protein expression. Amplification or overexpression of MCM7 was significantly associated with relapse, local invasion and a worse tumor grade. Constitutive expression of MCM7 in a human prostate cancer cell line, DU145, resulted in markedly increased DNA synthesis and cell proliferation compared to vector-only controls, and an increased cell invasion in vitro. Indeed, MCM7 overexpression produced primary tumors 12 times larger than vector-only controls and resulted in a rapid demise of mice bearing those tumors. These studies implicate MCM7, and the DNA replication licensing gene family, in prostate cancer progression, growth and invasion."

We suggest that the choice of cholesterol synthesis route may provide a physiological mechanism to modulate raft-dependent functions in cells. In model membranes, cholesterol associates preferentially with long, saturated acyl chains, such as those in sphingolipids, thus reducing the area per lipid molecule (1Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E.

Instead, unsaturated phospholipids are loosely packed, forming a liquid-disordered (Ld) membrane that is solubilized upon the addition of mild detergents. At least in model membranes, cholesterol is able to promote the separation of Lo and Ld domains (7Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E.

Taking the postulated critical role for cholesterol in raft formation and the diversity of sterols in biological materials, the sterol structural requirements for promoting ordered domain formation are highly relevant. Until now, the effects of sterol/steroid structure have mostly been addressed in model membranes. Slight modifications of the cholesterol structure (e.g. a shift of the double bond in the sterol ring or alteration of the 3-OH group) change the domain-forming properties of the molecule (12Bacia K. Schwille P. Kurzchalia T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 13Wang J. Megha London E.

Methods Enzymol. 2004; 383: 198-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Among the structurally closest relatives of cholesterol are its immediate biosynthetic precursors. The only difference between cholesterol and its immediate precursor desmosterol is an additional double bond between carbon atoms 24 and 25 in the tail of desmosterol (Fig. 1). Recently, the influence of desmosterol on lipid order was found to be similar to that of cholesterol (15Huster D. Scheidt H.A. Arnold K. Herrmann A. Muller P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1838-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cholesterol biosynthesis can proceed from lanosterol via two intersecting routes, the Kandutsch-Russell or Bloch pathways. The choice of pathway is determined by the stage at which the double bond at position C24 in the sterol side chain is reduced. If this double bond is retained until the last reaction, cholesterol synthesis proceeds via desmosterol (Bloch pathway), whereas early reduction leads to the formation of lathosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol (Kandutsch-Russell pathway). The biological significance of this complexity remains enigmatic. We have shown that in cellular membranes, lathosterol associated with DRMs at least as efficiently as cholesterol (16Lusa S. Heino S. Ikonen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19844-19851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Accordingly, also in model membranes, lathosterol formed rafts that were at least as detergent-resistant as, and even more thermally stable than, cholesterol-containing rafts (13Wang J. Megha London E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Moreover, 7-dehydrocholesterol was found to be more strongly domain-promoting than cholesterol (17Xu X.

In contrast to many relatives of cholesterol, desmosterol is an abundant structural membrane component in mammalian cells, such as spermatozoa and astrocytes (18Lin D.S. Connor W.E. Wolf D.P.

Instead, 24-reductase knock-out mice exhibit a much milder phenotype, being viable although small and infertile (22Wechsler A. Brafman A. Shafir M. Heverin M. Gottlieb H. Damari G. Gozlan-Kelner S.

In the present work, we compared the roles of desmosterol and cholesterol in membrane organization by employing spectroscopic methods in model membranes and detergent solubility in model and cell membranes. In addition, we addressed the functional effects of exchanging the majority of membrane cholesterol to desmosterol in living cells, by analyzing both raft-dependent and -independent parameters. We found that the biophysical and functional properties of desmosterol differ considerably from those of cholesterol. These studies were complemented by detailed atomistic simulations to shed light on the origin of these differences, which initiates from the hydrocarbon tail region in the two sterols. Multilamellar Vesicle Preparation—Lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids except for desmosterol (Steraloids) and cholesterol (Sigma). Desired lipid mixtures were prepared from stock solutions (Table 1). All multilamellar vesicles were prepared containing 15 mol % cholesterol, desmosterol, or no sterol. Samples that were measured by fluorescence also included 0.5% 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Lipids were dried under N2 and redissolved in 20 μl of chloroform. After redrying under N2 and further drying for 1 h at high vacuum, the lipids were dissolved in the desired volume of PBS. To ensure uniform dispersion of the vesicles, the samples were incubated at 55 °C for 15 min, during which each sample was vortexed 4 times for 30 s. The vesicles were incubated for at least 1 h at the desired temperature before experiments.TABLE 1Composition of MLVs used in the assaysAssayMolar ratiosTotal lipid concentrationDPPCDOPC12-SLPCμmDetergent turbidity11500DPH quenching FDPPC1150 F0DPPC1150 FDOPC1150 F0DOPC150DPH polarization1150 Open table in a new tab Detergent Turbidity—Detergent turbidity measurements were performed essentially as described in Ref. 17Xu X.

Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence emission spectra and polarization were recorded using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorometer (Varian, Cary, NC) equipped with a thermostated cuvette holder. The excitation/emission wavelengths were 359 and 427 nm, respectively. Measurements were carried out in quartz cuvettes in which the samples were kept homogeneous by magnetic stirring, and the temperature inside the cuvette was monitored during experimentation. For DPH quenching measurements, fluorescence was measured while heating the samples continuously from 21 to 56 °C and cooling back to 21 °C with a rate of 1 °C/min. The heating and cooling curves were similar. F/F0 represents relative unquenched fluorescence (i.e. the ratio of fluorescence intensity in a 1-palmitoyl-2-(12-doxyl)-stearoylphosphatidylcholine (12-SLPC)-containing mixture (F) normalized relative to the fluorescence intensity in vesicles where the quencher lipid 12-SLPC was replaced by dioleylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) (F0). The degree of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)-rich domain formation is given by ΔF/F0, the difference between the unquenched fluorescence in the DPPC/12-SLPC vesicles and DOPC/12-SLPC vesicles that do not form segregated lipid domains (i.e. F/F0DPPC - F/F0DOPC). To derive domain transition temperatures (Tm) and formation coefficients (a), ΔF/F0 versus temperature plots were fitted by a sigmoidal Boltzmann equation (23Wenz J.J. Barrantes F.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14267-14276Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The Tm is given by the half point of the curves, and the domain formation coefficient by the difference in the degree of domain formation (ΔF/F0) before and after domain melting. This was calculated by subtracting the lower asymptote of the Boltzmann equation from the higher asymptote.

Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar) to near confluence and scraped in PBS. All of the following steps were performed at temperatures between 0 and 4 °C. The cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in 400 μl of buffer containing 140 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with protease inhibitors (chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin at 25 μg/ml each). The cells were lysed by passing them 60 times through a 25-gauge needle, after which the nuclei were spun down by centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 × g. 400 μl of supernatant was mixed with 1600 μl of 2.4 m sucrose and transferred to a SW28Ti ultracentrifuge tube. The sample was overlaid with a step gradient of 1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.2, 1.0, 0.8, and 0.6 m sucrose. After centrifugation for 24 h, at 70,000 × g at 4 °C, 2-ml fractions were collected and used for sterol determination, Western blotting, or DRM isolation. DRM Isolation—The protocol used for DRM isolation is an adaptation of Ref. 25Arreaza G. Melkonian K.A. LaFevre-Bernt M. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19123-19127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. All steps were performed at 0-4 °C. 10% Triton X-100 was added to the low density fractions (∼0.7-0.9 m sucrose) to a final concentration of 0.5% (total volume 4.6 ml) followed by a 30-min incubation on ice. The samples were adjusted to 40% sucrose by adding 85% sucrose in TNE (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), transferred to a SW28Ti tube and overlaid with 3 ml of 35% sucrose TNE and 2 ml of 5% sucrose TNE. After centrifugation for 18 h at 80,000 × g, the DRMs at the interface between the 5 and 35% sucrose layers were separated from the solubilized membranes in the 40% sucrose phase. Sterol Determination—Free sterols were quantified as described in Ref. 26Heino S. Lusa S. Somerharju P. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V.M. Ikonen E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8375-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar. Briefly, lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). The free sterol fraction was isolated by TLC (petroleum ether/diethyl ether/acetate 60:40:1) and analyzed by silver ion high performance liquid chromatography (Ag+-HPLC) using UV detection. Sterol Exchange—Human hepatoma HuH7 cells were plated on gelatin-coated dishes 2 days prior to the experiments. To deplete cellular cholesterol, the cells were incubated for 30 min on a shaking water bath (50 rpm) at 37 °C in the presence of 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD). Then the cells were washed three times with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions (PBS+) and incubated in the presence of either cholesterol-MβCD or desmosterol-MβCD complex for 1 h at 37°C without shaking (complex prepared as in Ref. 28Ohvo-Rekila H. Akerlund B. Slotte J.P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 105: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar; molar ratio of desmosterol/MβCD = 1.0:8.7, used in a concentration of 50 μg/ml of sterol). Thereafter, the complexes were removed, cells washed three times with PBS+ and subjected to further experiments. Essentially no cells were lost during the procedure. Insulin Stimulation and Optiprep Gradient—Sterol exchange was performed as above, and 10 nm insulin (Actrapid©, Novo Nordisk) was added to the indicated samples for 5 min. Thereafter, the cells were processed for analyzing IR activity or IR DRM association using Optiprep gradient fractionation in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 as described (29Vainio S. Bykov I. Hermansson M. Jokitalo E. Somerharju P. Ikonen E. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Vainio S. Heino S. Mansson J.E. Fredman P. Kuismanen E. Vaarala O. Ikonen E. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Albumin Secretion and [125I]Insulin Binding—For analyzing albumin secretion, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in serum-free medium containing 25 mm mevalonate and 10 μm lovastatin after sterol exchange. The media were then collected and centrifuged briefly to remove any cells present. The proteins in the media were recovered by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and the amount of albumin was analyzed by Western blotting. The albumin amounts were corrected with the amount of cellular protein in each sample. For analyzing [125I]insulin binding, the cells were put on ice after the sterol exchange and incubated in the presence of 50 pm [125I]insulin (specific activity 2000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and 0, 0.1, 1.0, 10, or 100 nm unlabeled insulin for 30 min. The cells were washed five times and lysed in 0.05 n NaOH, 0.1% SDS, and radioactivity in the samples was measured with Wallac 1470 automatic γ counter. Unspecific binding (determined as the radioactivity in samples containing 100 nm unlabeled insulin) was subtracted from the values, and 125I-insulin binding expressed as counts/min/mg of protein. Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed as described previously (30Vainio S. Heino S. Mansson J.E. Fredman P. Kuismanen E. Vaarala O. Ikonen E. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). 20 μg of cellular protein or equal volumes from gradient fractions were used for analysis. Antibodies used were from Prof. Ari Helenius (anti-calnexin, rabbit polyclonal), Transduction Laboratories (anti-IRβ; rabbit polyclonal), DAKO (anti-human albumin, rabbit polyclonal), Upstate Biotechnology (anti-Tyr(P); mouse monoclonal, clone 4G10), and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (anti-caveolin, rabbit polyclonal). Analysis of IR activation and quantification of Western blotting results were performed as described (29Vainio S. Bykov I. Hermansson M. Jokitalo E. Somerharju P. Ikonen E. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Vainio S. Heino S. Mansson J.E. Fredman P. Kuismanen E. Vaarala O. Ikonen E. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on coverslips were subjected to the sterol exchange protocol, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl, and stained with filipin (Sigma) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-lentil lectin (Sigma). Images were captured with an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope equipped with a CCD camera, and similar exposure times were used for all of the conditions. Atomic Scale Simulations—We studied three different bilayers composed of lipid and cholesterol/desmosterol molecules hydrated with 3600 waters. The first bilayer comprised 128 DPPCs. The second and third bilayers had 128 DPPCs together with 32 cholesterol and desmosterol molecules, respectively. The simulations were performed using the GROMACS suite (31Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar). The parameters for bonded and nonbonded interactions for DPPC molecules were taken from a previous study for a pure DPPC bilayer (32Berger O. Edholm O. Jahnig F. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2002-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar), and the partial charges are from the underlying model description (33Tieleman D.P. Berendsen H.J.C J. Chem. Phys. 1996; 105: 4871-4880Crossref Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The cholesterol force field was taken from Ref. 34Holtje M. Forster T. Brandt B. Engels T. von Rybinski W. Holtje H.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1511: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar. For desmosterol, we employed the same force field except for the hydrocarbon tail region, in which the double bond was described by the standard Gromacs force field (available on the World Wide Web at www.gromacs.org). For water, the SPC model was used (35Berendsen H.J.C Postma J.P.M van Gunsteren W.F. Pullman B. Intermolecular Forces. Reider, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1981Google Scholar). Each simulation covered a time scale of 100 ns, including the equilibration period of 20 ns prior to analysis. Due to the extensive time scale of the simulations, statistical difference in the structural results was very small (S.D. < 1%). Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all three directions and the LINCS algorithm (36Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J.C Fraaije J.G.E.M. J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (10848) Google Scholar) was employed to constrain the bond lengths, including the hydrogen atoms. The time step was set to 2 fs. The simulations were carried out at constant pressure (1 atm) and temperature (323 K). The Berendsen thermostat and barostat (37Berendsen H.J.C Postma J.P.M Vangunsteren W.F. Dinola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (22550) Google Scholar) were applied with time constants of 0.5 and 0.6 ps, respectively. The temperatures of the solute and solvent were controlled independently. A semi-isotropic scheme for pressure control was employed, and the particle mesh Ewald method (38Essmann U. Perera L. Berkowitz M.L. Darden T. Lee H. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 8577-8593Crossref Scopus (14871) Google Scholar) was used for electrostatics. A more detailed description of the simulation protocol used in this study can be found elsewhere (39Falck E. Patra M. Karttunen M. Hyvonen M.T. Vattulainen I. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1076-1091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 40Falck E. Patra M. Karttunen M. Hyvonen M.T. Vattulainen I. J. Chem. Phys. 2004; 121: 12676-12689Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Effects of Desmosterol and Cholesterol on the Formation and Stability of Ordered Domains in Model Membranes—The level of ordered domain formation in the presence of cholesterol versus desmosterol was studied using a detergent insolubility assay. In this method, the light scattering remaining after the addition of Triton X-100 to a multilamellar vesicle preparation was measured by OD. A 1:1 mixture of DPPC and DOPC with or without 15% sterol was used. The main phase transition temperatures of pure fully hydrated DPPC and DOPC membranes are about 42 and -20 °C, respectively. In the vesicles, DPPC-rich ordered domains coexist with DOPC-rich fluid domains at 23 °C, and the percentage of OD remaining after the detergent addition roughly approximates the fraction of DRMs present in the preparation (41Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). In agreement with earlier results, we found that the addition of cholesterol to the liposomes significantly decreased solubility as indicated by higher remaining ODs in the presence of cholesterol as compared with absence of sterol (Fig. 2A) (41Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). However, desmosterol was much less efficient than cholesterol in promoting insolubility by using the same criteria (Fig. 2A). The differential solubility of cholesterol and desmosterol containing liposomes was also observed in liposomes containing 30 mol % of sterol (data not shown). To further investigate the potential differences between desmosterol and cholesterol in the degree to which they promote ordering, we measured the steady-state DPH fluorescence polarization in 1:1 DPPC/DOPC vesicles, with or without 15% sterol. The higher the DPH fluorescence polarization, the more closely packed (ordered) is the lipid environment (42Lentz B.R. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1993; 64: 99-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We found that DPH polarization was significantly higher in cholesterol- than in desmosterol-containing liposomes (Fig. 2B), suggesting higher order in cholesterol-containing lipid mixtures. Yet, desmosterol increased DPH polarization as compared with the situation in the absence of sterol (Fig. 2B). This supports the idea that desmosterol is capable of tightening lipid packing (ordering), albeit less efficiently than cholesterol. Next, the contribution of the two sterols in domain formation and the relative stability of the ordered domains was assessed in fluorescence quenching experiments. Vesicles were prepared of a 1:1 mixture of DPPC and a nitroxide-labeled phosphatidylcholine (12-SLPC, a fluorescence-quenching lipid with phase behavior similar to DOPC) with or without 15% sterol and trace amounts of DPH. DPPC and 12-SLPC tend to form separated DPPC-rich ordered and 12-SLPC-rich disordered domains. DPH displays equal partitioning between both phases. Moreover, perturbations induced by DPH are weak and of local nature and do not affect thermotropic behavior in any significant manner (43Repakova J. Holopainen J.M. Morrow M.R. McDonald M.C. Capkova P. Vattulainen I. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 3398-3410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the 12-SLPC domain, DPH fluorescence is quenched but DPH molecules remaining in the DPPC-rich domain have a low probability of interacting with quencher molecules and give higher fluorescence intensity. In this domain-forming lipid mixture, the temperature dependence of quenching can reveal the thermal stability of ordered domains; upon increasing temperature, the domains start to “melt,” and DPH fluorescence starts to decrease because of increasing contact with 12-SLPC molecules. The midpoint of a quenching versus temperature curve (i.e. the apparent melting temperature) is a measure of domain stability (17Xu X. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilcheze C. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33540-33546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 41Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows the sterol and thermal dependence of DPH fluorescence obtained with this method. In agreement with previous studies, there is domain formation at 23 °C in the absence of sterol, and the degree of domain formation decreases upon increasing the temperature, being abolished by 37 °C (41Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C, no sterol). Also consistent with earlier data, domain formation was enhanced by cholesterol, as indicated by the increase in the initial fluorescence at 20-23 °C (Fig. 2C) and calculated formation parameter (23Wenz J.J. Barrantes F.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14267-14276Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). Importantly,"

Data showing an inhibitory effect of IL-4 and IL-13 on RANK mRNA in mouse calvariae were first reported at the 22nd American Society for Bone and Mineral Research Meeting (Lerner, U.H., and Conaway, H. H. 2000) J. Bone Min. Res. 15, Suppl. 1, Abstr. SU 230). In the present study, release of 45Ca from cultured mouse calvarial bones stimulated by different cytokines, peptides, and steroid hormones was inhibited by IL-4 and IL-13. IL-4 and IL-13 decreased receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) and RANK mRNA and increased osteoprotegerin (OPG) mRNA in calvariae. Additionally, the cytokines decreased RANKL protein and increased OPG protein in calvarial bones. In osteoblasts isolated from calvariae, both an increase in RANKL mRNA and a decrease in OPG mRNA and protein elicited by vitamin D3 were reversed by IL-4 and IL-13. IL-4 and IL-13 decreased the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase positive multinucleated cells and the mRNA expression of calcitonin receptor, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and cathepsin K in mouse spleen cells and bone marrow macrophages (BMM) treated with macrophage colony-stimulating factor and RANKL. Inhibition of mRNA for RANK and the transcription factor NFAT2 was also noted in spleen cell and BMM cultures treated with IL-4 and IL-13. In addition, RANK mRNA and RANK protein were decreased by IL-4 and IL-13 in RAW 264.7 cells. Osteoblasts, spleen cells, and BMM expressed mRNA for the four proteins making up the IL-4 and IL-13 receptors. No effects by IL-4 on bone resorption and osteoclast formation or on RANKL and RANK mRNA expression were seen in Stat6–/– mice. The data indicate that IL-4 and IL-13, via a STAT6-dependent pathway, inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by activating receptors on osteoblasts and osteoclasts that affect the RANKL/RANK/OPG system.

Immune cells are thought to play an important role in bone loss caused by inflammation (1Arron J.R. Choi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 535-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 2Takayanagi H. J. Mol. Med. 2005; 83: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Disabling joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis and the loss of teeth in periodontal disease are examples of skeletal loss that can occur with inflammation. Resorption of bone by osteoclasts represents the primary mechanism responsible for the loss of bone caused by inflammatory disease.

M-CSF is a secreted product of stromal cells/osteoblasts that enhances colony expansion of monocyte/osteoclast progenitor cells. RANKL exists both as a transmembrane protein in osteoblasts/stromal cells and as a soluble protein (3Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (3060) Google Scholar, 4Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Takami M. Suda T. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. 2nd Ed.

Oral Biol. Med. 2004; 15: 64-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). RANKL directs the expanded progenitor cell population to the osteoclast lineage by activation of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK). The interaction between RANKL and RANK can be inhibited by osteoprotegerin (OPG), a decoy receptor released from stromal cells/osteoblasts. RANKL stimulation of RANK causes receptor trimerization and recruitment of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs). TRAF1, 2, 3, and 5 bind to the carboxyl-terminal end of the RANK trimer, whereas TRAF6 binds more closely to the membrane. Downstream intracellular signaling mediated by RANK in osteoclast progenitor cells includes TRAF6-dependent activation of NF-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) and AP-1, and activation of c-Src and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (5Boyle W.J.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 3353-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The bone resorbing effects of stimulatory cytokines can be inhibited by IL-4 and IL-13 (16Horowitz J. Lorenzo J.A. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 961-978Google Scholar). IL-4 and IL-13 are 19- and 10-kDa proteins, respectively; they are secreted by Th2-type lymphocytes and mast cells and have pleiotropic immune functions. Although the amino acid sequences of IL-4 and IL-13 exhibit only 25% homology, the two cytokines have many overlapping functions, including the utilization of closely related receptors. Type 1 and Type 2 IL-4 receptors are formed by heterodimerization of IL-4 receptor α (IL-4Rα) protein to either the γ common chain (γc), a receptor component that is also found in receptors for IL-2, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21, or to the IL-13 receptor α1 (IL-13Rα1) protein, respectively (21Kelly-Welch A.E. Hanson E.M. Boothby M.R. Keegan A.D. Science. 2003; 300: 1527-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 22Khurana Hershey G.K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2003; 111: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Receptor dimerization, either because of binding of IL-4 to IL-4Rα in Type 1 or 2 receptors or because of binding of IL-13 to IL-13Rα1 in IL-13 receptors, causes binding to the Box1 region in IL-4Rα of JAK-1 in the Janus kinase family, which leads subsequently to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of IL-4Rα. Tyrosine residues 2–4 of IL-4Rα act as docking sites for the transcription factor STAT6 (signal transducers and activators of transcription), which homodimerizes and translocates to the nucleus following tyrosine phosphorylation (21Kelly-Welch A.E. Hanson E.M. Boothby M.R. Keegan A.D. Science. 2003; 300: 1527-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Activation of IL-4 and IL-13 receptors also results in binding of Tyk2, another member of the Janus kinase family, to the Box region of IL-13Rα. Ligand binding to IL-4Rα additionally causes phosphorylation of the tyrosine 1 residue in the IL-4Rα protein, which then acts as a docking site for insulin receptor substrate-1 and insulin receptor substrate-2, which subsequently become phosphorylated and can activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Although much is known about the events following IL-4 receptor activation, downstream intracellular signaling by IL-13 receptors has not been characterized as well. Interestingly, IL-13Rα2 binds IL-13 with high affinity, but this has not been observed to result in a biological response, suggesting the possibility that IL-13Rα2 might function as a decoy receptor. IL-4 has been shown to inhibit in vitro bone resorption in neonatal mouse calvariae stimulated by IL-11 (23Ahlen J. Andersson S. Mukohyama H. Roth C. Bäckman A. Conaway H.H. Lerner U.H. Bone. 2002; 31: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and in mouse long bones stimulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 (D3), IL-1, and prostaglandin E2 (24Watanabe K.

Administration of IL-4 in vivo to mice inhibits hypercalcemia induced by parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP; 25) and bone loss caused by ovariectomy (26Nakano Y. Watanabe K. Morimoto I.

Morimoto I. Ura K. Nakano Y. Tanaka Y. Nishida S. Nakamura T. Eto S. Bone. 1998; 22: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Juxtaarticular bone resorption in mice with collagen type II-induced arthritis can be decreased by local production of IL-4 introduced by an adenovirus vector (28Lubberts E.L. Joosten L.A.B. Chabaud M. van den Bersselaar L. Oppers B. Coenen-de Roo H.C.J. Richards C.D. Miossec P. van den Berg W.B. J. Clin.

Heinegård D. van den Berg W.B. Arthritis Res. 1999; 1: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similarly, bone resorption in adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats can be decreased by injection of an adenovirus producing IL-4 (30Woods J.M. Katschke K.J. Volin M.V. Ruth J.H. Woodruff D.C. Amin Connors M.A. Kurata H. Arai K. Haines G.K. Kumar P. Koch A.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In an ex vivo model of bone resorption in rheumatoid arthritis, IL-4 has been found to inhibit the appearance of osteoclasts (31Miossec P. Chomarat P. Dechanet J. Moreau J.F. Roux J.P. Delmas P. Banchereau J. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 1715-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In organ culture studies, the inhibition by IL-4 of the stimulatory effect of IL-1 on bone resorption has been suggested to be because of inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 expression (32Onoe Y. Miyaura C. Kaminakayashiki T. Nagai Y. Noguchi K. Chen Q.R. Seo H. Ohta H. Nozawa S. Kudo I. Suda T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 758-764PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kawaguchi H. Nemoto K. Raisz L.G.

The inhibitory effect of IL-4 on bone resorption in vitro is thought to involve decreased osteoclastogenesis. IL-4 has been shown to inhibit osteoclast formation in mouse bone marrow cultures, in co-cultures of mouse spleen cells and ST-2 stromal cells stimulated by D3 (34Riancho J.A. Zarrabeitia M.T. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T. Gonzalez-Macias J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and in mouse bone marrow cultures stimulated by PTH, D3, and IL-1α (35Shioo A. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Welgus H.G. Suzuki H.

Bone Miner. 1993; 21: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that IL-4 can inhibit osteoclast formation not only by acting directly on cells in the myelomonocytic lineage but also by acting indirectly on T-cells to induce the expression of an hitherto unknown membrane-associated inhibitor (37Mirosavljevic D. Quinn J.M. Elliott J. Horwood N.J. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 984-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Several molecular mechanisms have been suggested for the inhibition of osteoclast formation by IL-4. These include decreased RANK stimulation of osteoclast progenitor cells by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ1 (38Bendixen A.C. Shevde N.K. Dienger K.M. Willson T.M. Funk C.D. Pike J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2443-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), inhibition of inhibitor of κB(IκB) phosphorylation, and decreased nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) nuclear translocation (39Abu-Amer Y. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1375-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and inhibition of signaling through c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (40Wei S. Wang M.W.H. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6622-6630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IL-4 is not believed to affect M-CSF signaling in osteoclast progenitor cells through the MAP kinase (JNK and ERK) or Akt pathways (40Wei S. Wang M.W.H. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6622-6630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to determine whether IL-4 and IL-13 might inhibit bone resorption by initiating responses in both stromal cells/osteoblasts and osteoclast progenitor cells that alter the RANKL/RANK/OPG system. Materials—Synthetic bovine parathyroid hormone (PTH-(1–34)) was obtained from Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland; recombinant murine M-CSF, recombinant murine RANKL, mouse OPG fused to human IgG1 Fc (OPG/Fc chimera), recombinant human TNF-α, recombinant human IL-1β, recombinant human IL-6, recombinant human IL-6 soluble receptor, recombinant murine IL-4, recombinant murine IL-13, recombinant murine oncostatin M (OSM), immunoassay kits for mouse OPG, and mouse RANKL and goat RANK-specific IgG purified by mouse RANK affinity chromatography were from R&D Systems, Abdingdon, UK; essentially fatty acid-free albumin, trans-retinoic acid, dexamethasone, and the kit for leukocyte acid phosphatase staining were from Sigma; fetal bovine serum (FBS) from ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA; [45Ca]CaCl2 from Amersham Biosciences; Thermo Sequenase-TM II DYEnamic ET® terminator cycle sequencing kit from Amersham Biosciences; HotStar Taq polymerase kit and the QIAquick PCR Purification kit from Qiagen Ltd., Crawley, West Sussex, England; culture dishes and multiwell plates from Costar, Cambridge, MA; α-modification of minimum essential medium (α-MEM), TRIzol LS Reagent, deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I; amplification grade), and oligonucleotide primers from Invitrogen; fluorescent labeled probes (reporter fluorescent dye VIC at the 5′ end and quencher fluorescent dye TAMRA at the 3′ end) and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix were from Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK; the 1st strand cDNA synthesis Kit and PCR Core Kit from Roche Diagnostics; RNAqueous®-4PCR kit for isolation of DNA-free RNA from Ambion Inc., Austin, TX; fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled affinity pure rabbit antibodies to goat IgG from Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Baltimore Pike, PA. Synthetic salmon calcitonin (CT) was generously provided from Sandoz AG, Basle, Switzerland; 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 from Hoffmann-La Roche, Basle, Switzerland; and indomethacin from Merck Sharp and Dohme, Haarlem, The Netherlands. Other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade. D3 and indomethacin were dissolved in ethanol; the final concentration of ethanol never exceeded 0.1% and did not by itself affect 45Ca release in mouse calvariae or osteoclastogenesis in spleen cell cultures. All other compounds were dissolved either in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or culture medium. The RAW 264.7 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Chantal Chenu, Lyon, France. Animals—CsA mice from our own inbred colony were used for most experiments. Mice homozygous for the Stat4tm1Gru mutation in a BALB/c background (C.129S2-Stat4tm1Gru/J; stock number 002826), mice homozygous for the Stat6tm1Gru mutation in a BALB/c background (C.129S2-Stat6tm1Gru/J; stock number 002828) and their corresponding wild type mice BALB/cJ (stock number 000651) JAX®MICE, were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, and were bred in our animal facility unit. Calvarial bones and spleen cells from Stat6–/– mice did not express STAT6 mRNA as assessed by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses (data not shown). Animal care and experiments were approved and conducted in accordance with accepted standards of humane animal care and use as deemed appropriate by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden. Bone Resorption Bioassay—Bone resorption was assessed by culturing calvarial bones dissected from 6–7-day-old mice (CsA, Stat6–/–, Stat4–/–, BALB/cJ) prelabeled 4 days previously with an injection of 1.5 μCi of 45Ca. The bones were dissected in four pieces (41Ljunggren Ö. Ransjö M. Lerner U.H. J. Bone Min. Res. 1991; 6: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and preincubated overnight in α-MEM containing 0.1% albumin and 1 μmol/liter indomethacin (42Lerner U.H. J. Bone Min. Res. 1987; 2: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In one set of experiments, calvarial bones were incubated in α-MEM with or without IL-4 or IL-13 for 24 h after the initial pre-culture period. This was followed by a 96-h incubation in the absence and presence of hormones and cytokines stimulating bone resorption, with or without IL-4 or IL-13. In another set of experiments, subsequent to the 24-h preculture in indomethacin the calvarial bones were cultured in the absence and presence of hormones and cytokines stimulating bone resorption, with and without the continuous presence of indomethacin. At the end of the cultures, 45Ca in bones and media was analyzed using liquid scintillation counting. Release of isotope was expressed as the percentage release of the initial amount of isotope (calculated as the sum of radioactivity in medium and bone after culture) (42Lerner U.H. J. Bone Min. Res. 1987; 2: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the data were recalculated and the results expressed as percent of control, which was set at 100%. This allowed for accumulation of data from several experiments. In time course experiments, mice were injected with 12.5 μCi of 45Ca and the kinetics of the release of 45Ca was analyzed by withdrawal of small amounts of medium at the stated time points. Gene Expression in Mouse Calvarial Bone—Calvarial bones were dissected from 6–7-day-old mice (CsA, Stat6–/–, BALB/cJ), divided into halves along the sagittal suture and preincubated in α-MEM with 0.1% albumin and 1 μm indomethacin overnight. Following the pre-culture period, calvarial bones in one set of experiments were incubated either in control medium or medium containing IL-4 (50 ng/ml) or IL-13 (50 ng/ml) for 24 h. In another set of experiments, calvariae were incubated in control medium or medium containing D3 (10 nmol/liter), with or without IL-4 (50 ng/ml) or IL-13 (50 ng/ml) for 24 h. For semiquantitative RT-PCR, bones were homogenized and the RNA extracted from five bones per treatment group was pooled for subsequent analyses. When using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, bones were homogenized and RNA was extracted from individual bones (five/group) and used for analyses. Gene Expression in Mouse Calvarial Osteoblast Cultures—Bone cells were isolated from calvariae of 2–3-day-old CsA mice using a modified time sequential enzyme digestion technique (43Boonekamp P.M. Hekkelman J.W. Hamilton J.W. Cohn D.V. Jilka R.L. Proc. K. Ned. Akad. Wet. 1984; 87: 371-382Google Scholar). Cells from populations 6 to 10 were used. These cells showed an osteoblastic phenotype as assessed by their cyclic AMP responsiveness to PTH, expression of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and bone sialoprotein, and the capacity to form mineralized bone noduli (data not shown). The cells were seeded in culture flasks containing α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, l-glutamine, and antibiotics at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. After 4 days in flasks, the cells were seeded in culture dishes. Osteoblasts were plated at a density of 104 cells/cm2 in culture dishes containing α-MEM, 10% FBS. After attachment overnight, medium was changed to α-MEM, 10% FBS containing D3 (10 nmol/liter) with and without IL-4 (50 ng/ml) or IL-13 (50 ng/ml). In addition, cells were cultured in α-MEM, 10% FBS without test substances as a control group. Control and treatment groups each contained four dishes. After 8 and 48 h of culture, RNA was extracted and used for quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses. Gene Expression during Osteoclastogenesis in RAW 264.7 Cell Cultures—The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was seeded at a density of 103 cells/cm2 in culture dishes containing α-MEM, 10% FBS. After attachment overnight, cells were incubated in α-MEM, 10% FBS containing RANKL (100 ng/ml) without or with IL-4 (50 ng/ml), IL-13 (50 ng/ml), or OPG (300 ng/ml). In addition, cells were cultured in α-MEM, 10% FBS without test substances as a control group. After 2, 4, and 6 days, RNA was extracted and used for semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses. Gene Expression during Osteoclastogenesis in Mouse Spleen Cell Cultures—Spleen cells were isolated from 5–7-week-old mice (CsA, Stat6–/–, Stat4–/–, BALB/cJ) and seeded in 0.5 ml of α-MEM with 10% FBS on coverslips in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/cm2. After attachment overnight, the medium was changed and the cells were cultured in the absence and presence of M-CSF (25 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml), with and without IL-4 (50 ng/ml), IL-13 (50 ng/ml), or OPG (300 ng/ml). The cells were cultured in the presence of test substances for 4–5 days with medium changed after 3 days. At the end of the experiments, the cells were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) using the Sigma Diagnostics Acid Phosphatase kit by following the manufacturer's instruction. Cells positive for TRAP and having three or more nuclei were considered osteoclasts, and the number of multinucleated osteoclasts counted. Osteoclasts formed in the spleen cell cultures stimulated by M-CSF and RANKL were able to form pits when cultured on slices of bovine bone (data not shown). Osteoclast formation was associated with increased mRNA expression of calcitonin receptor (CTR), TRAP, and cathepsin K. No osteoclasts were formed when cells were treated with M-CSF or RANKL alone. Osteoclasts were also not formed in the presence of PTH or D3, demonstrating the lack of stromal cells in th"
https://openalex.org/W2032444886,"Morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) is normally expressed in the embryo promoting the development of several organs. Aberrant expression of BMP-2 occurs in approximately 98% of lung carcinomas, however, its role in regulating tumor growth is poorly understood. We show that BMP-2 induces Id-1 expression in lung cancer cell lines through its activation of Smad-1/5, which is dependent on cell culture conditions. A549 cells in DMEM/5% FCS BMP-2 activated Smad-1/5 and caused a transient increase in proliferation. In serum-free medium, BMP-2 induced significantly less Smad-1/5 activation and Id-1 expression, and produced significant growth inhibition. The affect of BMP-2 on tumor growth in vivo was substantially more significant. Recombinant BMP-2 coinjected with A549 cells, into nude mice increased proliferation and produced an increase in Id-1 expression. Forced expression of BMP-2 in A549 cells significantly enhanced tumor growth in the lungs following intravenous injection but not of subcutaneous tumors. Tumors in the lung were found to have an activated Smad-1/5 and expressed Id-1. Subcutaneous tumors expressed less activated Smad-1/5 and Id-1 than that of controls. Human lung carcinomas were also found to express an activated Smad-1/5 and Id-1. We provide evidence that BMP-2 promotes tumor growth. This paper highlights that cell culture experiments may not reveal the full biological affects of BMP-2, and its activity varies depending of the local environment."

However, few genes targeted by this pathway have been demonstrated to affect tumor development in vivo. Here we show that Tiam1, a selective Rac GTPase activator, is a Wnt-responsive gene expressed in the base of intestinal crypts and up-regulated in mouse intestinal tumors and human colon adenomas. Moreover, by comparing tumor development in APC mutant Min (multiple intestinal neoplasia) mice expressing or lacking Tiam1, we found that Tiam1 deficiency significantly reduces the formation and growth of polyps in vivo. However, invasion of malignant intestinal tumors is enhanced by a lack of Tiam1. In line with this, knock-down of Tiam1 reduced the growth potential of human colorectal cancer cells and their ability to form E-cadherin-based adhesions, a prerequisite for local invasion of tumor cells.

The lumen of the adult mammalian intestine is lined with an absorptive and secretory epithelium that undergoes continuous self-renewal. The epithelium is organized into two functional domains: one comprises proliferating progenitor cells located physically within crypts, and the other, comprises terminally differentiated specialized cells predominantly occupying the villi in the small intestine and the mucosal surface in the colon.

The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is initiated by extracellular Wnt glycoproteins binding transmembrane receptors. Ligand binding induces a cascade of protein-protein interactions, the ultimate consequence of which is stabilization and accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin. This protein, known also for its role in cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesion, relays the signal to the nucleus, where, through direct binding to TCF family transcription factors, it induces target gene expression; TCFs provide DNA-binding sequence specificity, and β-catenin provides essential transactivation domains (1Nelson W.J.

In addition, Tiam1 activity is regulated by post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions (reviewed in Ref. 17Mertens A.E. Roovers R.C. Collard J.G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Potentially oncoproteins could use these mechanisms to regulate Tiam1/Rac signaling.

Given the clinical significance of human colorectal tumors and the need to identify genes that influence intestinal tumor development, we decided to examine the role of Tiam1 in intestinal tumorigenesis.

Animals with a mixed C57BL/6//Balb/c background were used throughout the experiments. The mice were genotyped, and those carrying the Min allele were analyzed for intestinal tumor development (Tiam1+/+//Min/+, n = 37; Tiam1+/-//Min/+, n = 79; and Tiam1-/-//Min/+, n = 27). All of the mice analyzed were sacrificed at week 14 after birth. The entire small intestine as well as the colon were coiled into a Swiss roll-like configuration, fixed in formalin, and paraffin-embedded. The sections through the widest part of the roll were stained with hematoxylin/eosin, and a pathologist scored the number and grades of tumors blindly. For determining the size of lesions, a graticule was used to measure the largest dimension of all lesions from eight randomly selected mice of each genotype (Tiam1+/+//Min/+, Tiam1+/-//Min/+, and Tiam1-/-//Min/+) of the same gender and age at sacrifice. In total we measured the size of 315 lesions from Tiam1+/+//Min/+ mice, 297 lesions from Tiam1+/-//Min/+ mice, and 134 lesions from Tiam1-/-//Min/+ mice. Immunohistochemical staining of the intestine of wild type mice revealed Tiam1 expression in cells at the base of small intestine crypts (Fig. 1A). The cells occupying these positions include Paneth cells and neighboring progenitor cells. The Paneth cells are terminally differentiated secretory cells that control the intestinal bacterial flora. Interestingly, both Paneth and progenitor cells possess high levels of nuclear β-catenin (3Batlle E. Henderson J.T. Beghtel H. van den Born M.M. Sancho E. Huls G. Meeldijk J. Robertson J. van de Wetering M. Pawson T. Clevers H. Cell. 2002; 111: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), a hallmark of active canonical Wnt signaling, suggesting that Tiam1 might be a Wnt-responsive gene. As expected, no Tiam1 staining was observed in intestines from Tiam1-/- mice (Fig. 1A). We did not find abnormalities in the intestines of adult Tiam1-/- mice when compared with wild type mice. Analysis of markers of differentiation (such as lysozyme staining of Paneth cell granules, periodic acid Schiff staining of mucin production in goblet cells, and alkaline phosphatase staining of enterocytes) and proliferation (Ki-67 expression) revealed no differences between wild type and Tiam1-/- mice (Fig. 1, B-D, and data not shown). This indicates that Tiam1 deficiency does not visibly affect intestinal development or subsequent homeostasis. In contrast to the restricted expression of Tiam1 at the base of small intestine crypts of mice, the protein was expressed uniformly in adenomatous polyps arisen in Min/+ mice (Fig. 2A). These mice carry a nonsense mutation in the APC gene and produce intestinal tumors as a result of increased Wnt signaling (11Su L.K. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Preisinger A.C. Moser A.R. Luongo C. Gould K.A. Dove W.F. Science. 1992; 256: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). In addition, immunohistochemical staining of human colon adenomas from both familial adenomatous polyposis patients (n = 38) and sporadic cases (n = 13) revealed strong and uniform Tiam1 protein expression in all cases examined. The protein levels exceeded the levels in adjacent normal mucosa as found in mice (for example see Fig. 2B). Additionally, in normal human colonic mucosa, we observed a gradient of Tiam1 protein decreasing from cells at the base of the crypt to the luminal surface (Fig. 2C). This expression pattern parallels the gradient of Wnt pathway activity as documented in the colon (2van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E. Coudreuse D. Haramis A.P. Tjon-Pon-Fong M. Moerer P. van den Born M. Soete G. Pals S. Eilers M. Medema R. Clevers H. Cell. 2002; 111: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). Because Paneth cells are absent in the colon, positive cells within the base of the human crypt should represent progenitor cells. The specific expression of Tiam1 at sites of endogenous canonical Wnt signaling and its apparent up-regulation in neoplastic lesions resulting from excessive Wnt signaling prompted us to evaluate further whether Tiam1 is a Wnt-responsive gene. For this we used a human CRC cell line, DLD1, engineered to express inhibitory forms of TCF transcription factors upon the addition of doxycycline (2van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E. Coudreuse D. Haramis A.P. Tjon-Pon-Fong M. Moerer P. van den Born M. Soete G. Pals S. Eilers M. Medema R. Clevers H. Cell. 2002; 111: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). Abrogation of Wnt signaling by the induced expression of the inhibitory forms of TCF resulted in a complete loss of Tiam1 messenger RNA by 48 h (Fig. 3A). Protein expression was also significantly reduced in this interval (Fig. 3B). Down-regulation of Tiam1 was temporally correlated with the appearance of the inhibitory forms of TCF and occurred with similar kinetics to c-Myc and cyclin D1 (Fig. 3B), both considered direct TCF targets (21He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4075) Google Scholar, 22Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). Together these findings indicate that Tiam1 is a Wnt-responsive gene and potentially a direct TCF target. To further substantiate these findings, we overexpressed Wnt1 and an oncogenic form of β-catenin (lacking the Ser33 regulatory phosphorylation site) in RIE cells in which the Wnt pathway is not activated. Exogenous expression of both Wnt1 and β-catenin in RIE cells resulted in a significant up-regulation of Tiam1 protein levels (Fig. 3C), consistent with the canonical Wnt pathway controlling levels of expression of Tiam1. To further study the consequences of changes in the levels of Tiam1 in colon tumor cells, we engineered the human DLD1 cells to express siRNA designed to knock down Tiam1 upon the addition of doxycycline. In earlier studies, we have successfully used the Tiam1-specific siRNA sequence to down-regulate Tiam1 protein levels in other cell types (15Malliri A. Van Es S. Huveneers S. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30092-30098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We generated several independent DLD1 cell clones in which doxycycline addition induced a selective reduction in Tiam1 expression. The induced expression of siRNA of Tiam1 significantly reduced Tiam1 levels when compared with parental control TR7 cells as shown for clone C2 (Fig. 4A). Compared with TR7 control cells, all individual clones (as well as a population of mixed clones) showed decreased growth potential in the presence of doxycycline (see Fig. 4B for clone C2). This suggests that the reduction of Tiam1 protein levels negatively affects cell growth in DLD1 cells. Knock-down of Tiam1 also influenced the growth pattern and morphological appearance of DLD1 cells. DLD1 cells normally grow in regular tessellated colonies and display an epithelioid phenotype with characteristic cadherin-based cell-cell adhesions (Fig. 4, C and D). Knock-down of Tiam1 resulted in diffuse colonies containing scattered, fibroblast-like cells (Fig. 4C) and release of β-catenin from the plasma membrane (Fig. 4D). These findings are consistent with the earlier reported requirement of Tiam1 in the formation and maintenance of cadherin-based cell adhesions (15Malliri A. Van Es S. Huveneers S. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30092-30098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). From these in vitro studies we conclude that Tiam1 is a Wnt-responsive gene that influences the growth rate of colorectal cancer cells as well as the strength of cadherin-based adhesions between these cells. Reduced cell-cell adhesion is frequently associated with the progression of epithelial tumors. To address whether Tiam1 expression contributes to the formation and progression of Wnt-induced intestinal tumors in vivo, we examined tumor formation in Min/+ mice in different Tiam1 backgrounds. In comparison with Tiam1+/+//Min/+ mice, Tiam1-/-//Min/+ mice demonstrated a 50% reduction (p < 0.005, t test) in intestinal tumor numbers (Fig. 5A). A similar proportional reduction in numbers was observed across the spectrum of tumor types including hyperplasias, adenomas, and adenocarcinomas (see Fig. 5B). Further analysis of the various tumors revealed that their growth was also significantly reduced in heterozygous Tiam1+/-//Min/+ mice and was reduced further in Tiam1-/-//Min/+ mice (Fig. 5C). The intermediate phenotype of the heterozygous mice indicates that the observed differences depend on the level of Tiam1 expression. From these studies we conclude that Tiam1 is a Wnt-responsive gene that is implicated in the formation and growth of Wnt-induced intestinal tumors. We also attempted to determine the rate of malignant progression of intestinal tumors in Tiam1+/+ or Tiam1-/- backgrounds. However, malignant progression is infrequently observed in Min/+ mice, because they are typically sacrificed at a young age because of morbidity arising from bowel obstruction and anemia. Malignant progression in the small intestine is defined as tumor invasion into the lamina propria or beyond. Upon sacrificing mice at 14 weeks, we observed a similar fraction of adenocarcinomas (∼8% of all lesions) independently of Tiam1 status, suggesting that Tiam1 deficiency does not affect the progression from adenomas to adenocarcinomas. However, when examining the extent of tumor invasion, we found a significantly larger fraction (p < 0.05; chi-squared test) of malignant tumors to have invaded into the submucosa and muscularis propria in Tiam1-/-//Min/+ mice compared with Tiam1+/+//Min/+ mice (Fig. 6A). Representative examples of invasion of malignant tumors into the submucosa and muscularis propria are shown in Fig. 6 (B and C, respectively). These data suggest that adenocarcinomas arisen in Tiam1-deficient mice are more aggressive than those arisen in Tiam1 wild type. Female Min/+ mice also develop mammary tumors at low incidence that are likewise attributed to aberrant Wnt signaling. Interestingly, in addition to the effect of Tiam1 depletion on intestinal tumorigenicity, we also observed a dramatic reduction in the incidence of mammary tumors in Tiam1+/-//Min/+ mice that was even more apparent in Tiam1-/-//Min/+ mice (Fig. 7A). Mammary tumors in Tiam1+/+//Min/+ mice were invariably squamous cell carcinomas and, when immunohistochemically stained for Tiam1, displayed Tiam1 up-regulation compared with normal mammary tissue (Fig. 7B). These findings further support our conclusions that Tiam1 is a Wnt-responsive gene that is implicated in the formation of Wnt-induced tumors including intestinal and mammary tumors. Because of its central role in intestinal tumorigenesis, several groups have concentrated on the identification of genes that are regulated by the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and especially those up-regulated in CRC cells (2van de Wetering M.

Certain of these targets have been demonstrated to regulate intestinal homeostasis, including notably c-Myb and EphB family members. However, few Wnt target genes have as yet been demonstrated to influence intestinal tumorigenesis in vivo (28Park B.H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pawson T. Gallinger S. Pals S. Clevers H. Nature. 2005; 435: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Our data presented here indicate that Tiam1 is a Wnt target gene involved in Wnt-induced tumorigenicity. Additional confirmation was recently provided by a gene-profiling screen that identified Tiam1 as a gene up-regulated in the intestines of APC conditional mutant mice (27Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E. Simon-Assmann P. Clevers H. Nathke I.S. Clarke A.R. Winton D.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The effects of Wnt signaling on Tiam1 levels could be either direct through TCF or indirect through another regulator that is itself a direct TCF target. The similar kinetics of down-regulation of Tiam1, c-Myc, and cyclin D1 by the inhibitory forms of TCF suggest that Tiam1 is a direct target of TCF. Using bioinformatics, we have identified two consensus TCF-binding sites directly upstream of the transcription start of Tiam1. These sites were located at -206 and -902 bp upstream of the transcription start in the human genome. Moreover, an additional six potential TCF sites were found in the region 2-5 kb downstream of the transcription start of human Tiam1. These sites might allow TCF to directly influence Tiam1 expression. Our data implicate Tiam1 in intestinal tumorigenesis. We find that Min/+ mice lacking Tiam1 have a significantly reduced susceptibility to develop Wnt-induced intestinal and mammary tumors. Moreover, the growth of these tumors is also significantly impaired. Our in vitro experiments using a human CRC-derived cell line in which Tiam1 was down-regulated confirmed the requirement for Tiam1 for optimal growth. Moreover, we observed increased Tiam1 expression in human colorectal tumors, suggesting that this gene is implicated in both mouse and human intestinal tumorigenesis. We previously observed that susceptibility to develop Ras-induced skin tumors, following application of a two-step chemical carcinogenesis protocol, was significantly reduced in Tiam1-/- mice (18Malliri A. van der Kammen R.A. Clark K. van der Valk M. Michiels F. Collard J.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Tiam1 physically associates with the activated Ras-GTPase, and this association stimulates Rac activity (32Lambert J.M. Lambert Q.T. Reuther G.W. Malliri A. Siderovski D.P. Sondek J. Collard J.G. Der C.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The Tiam1/Rac signaling module thus appears to be selectively recruited by at least two independent oncogenic signaling pathways of major clinical significance, albeit by distinct mechanisms. This suggests that Tiam1-mediated Rac activation is a significant modifier of tumor development and therefore a potentially interesting therapeutic target. The requirement for Tiam1 for optimal tumor cell growth is a consistent finding in both skin and intestinal tumor models and was also recently demonstrated for Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, an immortalized kidney epithelial cell line (15Malliri A. Van Es S. Huveneers S. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30092-30098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our data are also consistent with a previously published study showing that targeted expression of a dominant active mutant of Rac1 to the mouse intestine resulted in enlarged crypts and increased proliferation (15Malliri A. Van Es S. Huveneers S. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30092-30098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 33Stappenbeck T.S. Gordon J.I. Development. 2001; 128: 2603-2614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that Tiam1 deficiency results in reduced intestinal tumor numbers by increasing susceptibility to apoptosis of initiated intestinal epithelial cells, although this is very difficult to address in this model. However, analysis of apoptotic cells by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) did not reveal increased apoptosis in polyps arising in Tiam1-/-//Min/+ mice (data not shown). Knock-down of Tiam1 in DLD1 cells by siRNA reduced their ability to form cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesions, consistent with earlier in vitro studies showing that Tiam1 is critical for the formation and maintenance of cell-cell adhesions and for suppressing epithelial cell motility and invasion (15Malliri A. Van Es S. Huveneers S. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30092-30098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In vivo, and particularly with Ras-induced skin tumors, it appears that the loss of Tiam1 expression facilitates malignant progression, presumably by its effect on cadherin based cell adhesions. The observed increased invasive growth in the intestinal tumors could be due to the same phenomena, because we found reduced cadherin-based adhesions in DLD1 cells in which Tiam1 was down-regulated by siRNA. In a recent study overexpression of Tiam1 was found to increase the in vitro migration of SW480 colorectal carcinoma cells as well as their ability to metastasize in an orthotopic nude mouse model (34Minard M.E. Herynk M.H. Collard J.G. Gallick G.E. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2568-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The apparent discrepancy between our present data and the above study could potentially be attributable to the specific nature of the selected SW480 cells, in which Tiam1 overexpression does not promote cadherin-based cell-cell adhesions. Earlier studies have indicated that the effect of Tiam1 on invasion is cell type-specific and dependent on its capacity to influence E-cadherin-based adhesions (35Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, another Rac-specific exchange factor, Asef, expressed in CRC-derived cells, is able to antagonize cadherin-mediated adhesion and to promote cell motility in vitro (36Kawasaki Y. Sato R. Akiyama T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Asef is hyperactivated by truncated, mutant APC, found in the majority of CRC cells. Knock-down of Asef impaired CRC cell motility. Thus despite both molecules activating Rac, Asef, and Tiam1 promote different biological outcomes, consistent with the concept that guanine nucleotide exchange factors not only activate Rho-like molecules but also direct that activity to particular downstream signaling and biological ends (37Malliri A. Collard J.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data indicate cross-talk between the canonical Wnt and Tiam1/Rac signaling pathways that influences the initiation, growth, and progression of intestinal tumors.

In mouse embryonic fibroblasts endogenous Rho activity is present at the rear of migrating cells but also at the leading edge, whereas it is undetectable at the cell front of Gα12/13-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Spatial activation of Rho at the wound edge can be stimulated by lysophosphatidic acid. Active Rho colocalizes with the diaphanous-related formin Dia1 at the cell front. Gα12/13-deficient cells lack Dia1 localization to the wound edge and are unable to form orientated, stable microtubules during wound healing. Knock down of Dia1 reveals its requirement for microtubule stabilization as well as polarized cell migration. Thus, we identified Gα12/13-proteins as essential components linking extracellular signals to localized Rho-Dia1 function during directed cell movement. Scratch-wound assays are frequently used to study directed cell migration, a process critical for embryogenesis, invasion, and tissue repair.

Directional cell migration is a fundamental mechanism in wound repair and embryogenesis. In collective cell migration modes such as during embryogenesis, wound healing or invasion, cells dynamically regulate their cytoskeleton and become polarized toward direction of movement (1Sahai E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 2Friedl P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Many of these cytoskeletal changes are brought about by Rho-family GTPases, which are activated through cell surface receptors that in turn regulate specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (3Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). In wound healing assays with mammalian cells, the polarized morphology develops 1-6 h after injury of the cell monolayer and is characterized by formation of protrusions at the leading edge containing lamellipodia and filopodia, reorientation of the Golgi and the centrosome, as well as formation of stable and reoriented microtubules (3Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 4Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Kaibuchi K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 590-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Integrin signaling has been identified as a critical process for polarized cell migration in scratch-wound assays of cell monolayers (5Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Cell. 2001; 106: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). The potential role of heterotrimeric G-protein-dependent mechanisms during wound healing is less well understood. Gi-proteins have been implicated as signaling intermediates particularly in cell polarization during chemoattractant-guided motility of Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae or leukocytes (6Iijima M. Huang Y.E. Devreotes P. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 7Dormann D. Weijer C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Cell. 2003; 114: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The G12/13 family of G-proteins have been implicated in various cellular processes such as Rho-mediated organization of the cytoskeleton and subsequently the cell shape (9Offermanns S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 83: 101-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Gα12/13-proteins appear to exert essential functions as mice double-deficient for Gα12 and Gα13 die at embryonic day E 8.5 (9Offermanns S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 83: 101-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Coexpression of dominant negative versions of Gα12 and Gα13 reduced chemotactic polarity of differentiated HL-60 cells, suggesting that Gα12/13-proteins may function during directional cell migratory processes (8Xu J.

However, their potential role for wounding induced cell migration and tissue repair has not been investigated.Studies on wounding induced behavior of NIH3T3 fibroblasts revealed that addition of serum or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) 3The abbreviations used are: LPAlysophosphatidic acidGlu-MTdetyrosinated microtubulesMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastGFPgreen fluorescent proteinTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered salinesiRNAsmall interfering RNADADdiaphanous autoregulatory domainFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorter.3The abbreviations used are: LPAlysophosphatidic acidGlu-MTdetyrosinated microtubulesMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastGFPgreen fluorescent proteinTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered salinesiRNAsmall interfering RNADADdiaphanous autoregulatory domainFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorter. promotes the formation of a subpopulation of orientated microtubules known as stable, detyrosinated microtubules (Glu-MTs) (10Cook T.A. Nagasaki T. Gundersen G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Overexpression of dominant active versions of RhoA and the diaphanous-related formins have been shown to induce microtubule stabilization (11Palazzo A.F. Cook T.A. Alberts A.S. Gundersen G.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), but the upstream signaling components await to be defined. Although active mutants of RhoA or diaphanous-related formins can induce stable microtubule formation, it is not apparent whether they are indeed essential for this process. Rho-induced stabilization of Glu-MTs has been characterized as an early event in the generation of cellular asymmetry in wound healing assays and appears to precede the onset of cell migration (10Cook T.A. Nagasaki T. Gundersen G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 12Gundersen G.G. Bulinski J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5946-5950Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, regulation of RhoA activity during changes in cell-cell contact inhibition and directional migration such as in wound repair has not yet been analyzed directly. Although it has been suggested that Rho is involved in cell migration and is believed to be required for rear end retraction, its precise endogenous localization of activation such as in epithelial or mesenchymal cells is not known (13Wheeler A.P. Ridley A.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 301: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).The present study was undertaken to investigate whether trimeric G-protein function is principally required for wound healing in mammalian cells. We used previously established MEF cell lines that are double deficient for either Gαq/11 or Gα12/13 in addition to the usage of pertussis toxin to inactivate Gi (14Vogt S. Grosse R. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28743-28749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Additionally, we set out to systematically analyze the downstream signaling of Rho-family GTPases and addressed the role of localized RhoA activation in wounding induced cell migration using a novel GFP-tagged Rho probe combined with an optimized in situ Rho assay approach that was previously reported (15Berdeaux R.L. Diaz B. Kim L. Martin G.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Li Z. Aizenman C.D. Cline H.T. Neuron. 2002; 33: 741-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Our analysis provides evidence that Gα12/13 is absolutely essential for directional cell migration and wound healing involving Rho activity at the leading edge, which may control the formation of stable microtubules via Dia1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Antibody rabbit α-Glu-tubulin was provided by Dr. G. Gundersen or was from Chemicon; antibodies α-myc-TRITC and α-RhoA were from Santa Cruz; α-Ras, α-Rac, α-Cdc42, and α-p140mDia1 were from BD Transduction Laboratories; α-Flag-M2, α-α tubulin, and α-vinculin (mouse) were from Sigma-Aldrich.

The purified CRIB peptide was obtained from Leo S. Price (UMC, Utrecht). pEF-Flag-mDia1-ΔDAD (codons 1-1180) was generated by PCR using the primers 5′-gcgcgcatcgatatggagccgtccggcgggggc-3′ and 5′-gcgcgcactagtacctgtctgatcccccctgtg-3′, and the product was inserted via ClaI and SpeI into pEF-Flag (22Grosse R. Copeland J.W. Newsome T.P. Way M. Treisman R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3050-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Cell Culture, Wounding, and Live Cell Recording—MEF cell lines were generated from wild type as well as from embryos double deficient for Gαq/Gα11 and Gα12/Gα13 as described (17Zywietz A. Gohla A. Schmelz M. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3840-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. For wound healing assays, cells were seeded in 6-well plates, grown until confluent, and wounding was performed with a 10-μl tip that was cut longitudinally. Live cell recordings were performed immediately after wounding for 18 h at 37 °C using a Leica Microscope CTR MIC. Pictures were acquired every 30 min with a motor-controlled Leica DC 350 FX camera using the Leica software FW4000, which enables simultaneous recordings from multiple wells. For statistical analysis, the wound distance from each well was measured in duplicates at 3 randomly defined wound gap locations per frame recorded per experiment, and at least three independent scratch-wound experiments were used for calculations. To rescue Gα12/13 deficiency 15 × 10-cm dishes of Gα12/13-deficient MEFs were transfected with pEF-GFP, pCis-Gα12, and pCis-Gα13 using Transfectin. Cells were sorted for GFP expression 15 h after transfection with a FACS Vantage SE (BD Biosciences) in 0.2% FBS in PBS and were grown until confluent before wounding.Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100, and stained in PBS containing 5% FBS as described (22Grosse R. Copeland J.W. Newsome T.P. Way M. Treisman R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3050-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For visualization of Glu-microtubules, cells were fixed at -20 °C in methanol or in 8% formaldehyde. Images were obtained with a cooled CCD Leica DC 350 F camera on a Leica DMIRE 2 microscope and Leica IM 50 software and were imported in Adobe Photoshop. Fluorescence intensities were quantified and plotted using Scion Image (Scion Corp.).GTPase Activity Assays and Western Analysis—Biochemical analysis of scratch-induced GTPase activities was performed by making multiple wounds with an eight-channel pipette scratched across a 10-cm dish (38Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2003; 421: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Lysates from wounded MEFs or unwounded MEFs (time point 0) were subjected to either RhoA or Ras pull-down assays using immobilized GST-rhotekin-RBD or GST-Raf1-RBD respectively, as described (14Vogt S. Grosse R. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28743-28749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 39Grosse R. Roelle S. Herrlich A. Hohn J. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12251-12260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Rac and Cdc42 activity assays were performed in parallel to Ras or RhoA pull-downs by adding 1 μg/ml biotinylated CRIB peptide to the lysis reaction. CRIB peptide-bound GTP-Rac or GTP-Cdc42 was precipitated after addition of streptavidin-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) as described (19Price L.S. Langeslag M. ten Klooster J.P. Hordijk P.L. Jalink K. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39413-39421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE.GFP-GTPase-binding Domain (GBD) Probes and in Situ GTPase Affinity Assay—The plasmid encoding for GFP-RBD was generated using standard procedures by amplifying the cDNA of the RBD of mouse rhotekin encoding amino acids 7-89 using the following primers, forward 5′-tccggtaccatgggtatcctggaggacctcaatatg-3′ and reverse 5′-agatctggatccgtcttattagcctgtcttctccagcac-3′, introducing an NcoI and BamHI site, respectively. GFP-WASp-GBD was generated by amplifying the cDNA of the GTPase-binding domain of mouse Wiskott-Aldrich-Syndrome protein (WASp) encoding amino acids 201-310 using the primers forward 5′-tccggtaccatgggtatccagaaccctgacatcacg-3′ and reverse 5′-agatctggatccgtcttattactcctggcgcctcatctc-3′, introducing an NcoI and BamHI site, respectively.The PCR products were ligated into the H10GFPspacer-MCS1 vector. Bacterial fusion proteins were expressed in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 4 h in Luria-Bertani medium. His6-tagged fusion proteins were purified under native conditions according to the manufacturer (The QIAexpressionist™, Qiagen) on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). Proteins were eluted from beads with four incubations for 15 min at 4 °C using elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole). Fusion proteins were dialyzed overnight in dialyzing buffer (25 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol). GFP-RBD purifications were tested for in vitro activity by recoupling an aliquot to nickel-beads for pull-down experiments. For in situ Rho[GTP] affinity assays cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton/PBS. After blocking (5% FBS, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 m glycine in PBS, 45 min) cells were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with soluble GFP or GFP-RBD (0.02 μg/μl) in 5% FBS/PBS. Samples were washed and mounted using MOWIOL. Images were obtained by fluorescence microscopy using a Leica DMIRE 2 microscope and a CCD camera (Leica, Germany).RNA Interference-mediated Knockdown of Mouse Dia1—siRNA corresponding specifically to mDia1 RNA sequences were obtained from Qiagen and chosen according to Arakawa et al. (40Arakawa Y. Bito H. Furuyashiki T. Tsuji T. Takemoto-Kimura S. Kimura K. Nozaki K. Hashimoto N. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Transfection of MEFs with siRNA duplexes was efficiently performed using magnet-assisted transfection (MATra) as recommended by the manufacturer (IBA). Briefly, 2 μl of MATra-A reagent containing magnetic nanoparticles was complexed with siRNA (20 μm, 6 μl) in 6-well plates, and magnet force transfection was performed for 15 min on a magnet plate at 37 °C and 10% CO2. Cells were analyzed 48-72 h after siRNA transfection. For complementation assays RNA interference-resistant mDia1, mDia1-compl, containing two silent mutations at nucleotide positions 10 and 13 in the siRNA target sequence (A711G and C714A, mDia1 cDNA), was generated by overlap PCR using the primers 5′-cagcaggatccattgccctgaccagcagtag-3′, 5′-ctactgctggtcagggcaatggatcctgctg-3′ and 5′-aaggaaaatggcggccgctggagccgtccggcgggg-3′, 5′-cggccgctcgagttagcttgcacggccaaccagctc-3′. The full-length mDia1 complementation mutant was inserted via NotI and XhoI into the pcDNA3-Flag vector. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.DNA Microinjections—siRNA-treated wild type or Gα12/13-deficient MEF monolayers were wounded for 60 min before cells at the wound edge were microinjected into nuclei using an Eppendorf Femtojet and Injectman micromanipulator attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope. Pressure was adjusted to 75 hPa for 0.5 s using an Eppendorf femtotip needle, and plasmids were microinjected at 0.05 μg/μl. Wounding induced migration was continued for additional 2 h before fixation and immunofluorescence analysis.RESULTSGα12/13-proteins Are Essential for Directed Cell Movement during Wound Healing—To test whether G-protein-mediated signaling pathways are principally required for wound healing in the presence of serum we compared MEF lines generated from wild type embryos or from embryos double deficient for either Gαq/Gα11 or Gα12/Gα13, or MEFs treated with pertussis toxin to inhibit the Gi family of G-proteins (14Vogt S. Grosse R. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28743-28749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17Zywietz A. Gohla A. Schmelz M. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3840-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). MEF migration was initiated in the presence of 10% serum in a monolayer using the scratch-induced wound healing assay, and multiple time lap recordings were performed in parallel for 18 h. MEFs migrated into the wound as sheets to reform a tight monolayer within 7-8 h (250-300-μm wound width) (Fig. 1, A and C and supplemental movie 1). The average velocity was 0.84 ± 0.1 μm/min. Preincubation of MEFs with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin only moderately reduced wound healing, indicating that Gαi-proteins are not critically involved in mesenchymal cell migration (Fig. 1A) in contrast to their role in leukocyte motility (8Xu J. Wang F. Van Keymeulen A. Herzmark P. Straight A. Kelly K. Takuwa Y. Sugimoto N. Mitchison T. Bourne H.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Gαq/11-deficient fibroblasts required longer time periods as compared with wild type MEFs but also efficiently reformed an intact monolayer (Fig. 1A and supplemental movie 2). Surprisingly, Gα12/13-deficient cells completely lacked the ability to close the scratch wound (Fig. 1, A and C and supplemental movie 3). This defect was not due to impaired proliferation over the monitored time period (18 h) because Gα12/13-deficient cells proliferated at a slightly faster rate as wild type MEFs, or Gαq/11-deficient MEFs judged by cell countings performed in parallel (data not shown). The wound healing defect was confirmed using two different Gα12/13-deficient MEF clones to exclude clonal variation.To verify that Gα12/13-proteins are indeed required for wound healing in MEF monolayers Gα12/13-deficient fibroblasts were transfected with plasmids encoding Gα12, Gα13, and GFP, sorted for GFP-positive cells (3-7% transfection efficiency), and replated for wounding experiments. Reexpression of Gα12 and Gα13 restored the ability of Gα12/13-deficient MEFs to efficiently close the gap within 7-8 h (Fig. 1 and supplemental movie 4), clearly demonstrating that Gα12/13 are essential for wounding induced cell migration. Expression of either Gα12 or Gα13 alone only partially rescued wound healing of Gα12/13-deficient MEFs (data not shown).Cytoskeletal Characteristics in Wounded Gα12/13-deficient MEF Monolayers—Cell migration requires coordinated changes in cytoskeletal dynamics, which govern the protrusion of actin filament (F-actin) and microtubule-containing lamellipodia and filopodia at the front, retraction at the back, and constant assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions (18Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3772) Google Scholar). Hence, we analyzed the morphology of focal adhesions, F-actin, and microtubules of Gα12/13-deficient MEFs after wounding. Visualization of vinculin revealed that the general appearance of focal adhesions in Gα12/13-deficient cells was comparable with those of wild type MEFs over the entire wound-healing period (Fig. 2A). Comparison of F-actin between wild type and Gα12/13-deficient cells showed only moderate differences; leading edge Gα12/13-deficient MEFs appeared to have slightly lower F-actin contents, as judged by phalloidin staining (Fig. 2A). Strikingly although and in contrast to wild type MEFs, which adopted an elongated shape with long microtubule-containing protrusions toward the wound, Gα12/13-deficient MEFs displayed a microtubule meshwork that was not orientated and appeared disorganized (Fig. 2A). This phenotype was observed throughout scratch-induced migration, demonstrating that microtubule morphology and rearrangement were altered in cells lacking Gα12/13.FIGURE 2Cytoskeletal characteristics and Rho-GTPase signaling during directed migration of Gα12/13-deficient MEFs. A, scratch-induced migration was initiated in confluent monolayers of wild type (wt) or Gα12/13-deficient (G12/13-def.) MEFs for 4 h prior fixation and permeabilization. Cells were stained either for focal adhesions using vinculin antibodies, for F-actin using phalloidin, or for visualization of microtubules using α-tubulin antibodies as indicated. The direction of wound is indicated by a dotted white line. Scale bar, 10 μm. B-E, for GTPase activity lysates from scratch-wounded MEF monolayers were subjected to pull-down assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Times after wounding before cell lysis are indicated. Cdc42 (B) or Rac (C) pull-down assays were performed simultaneously to either Ras (D) or RhoA (E) assays by adding biotinylated CRIB peptide to the lysis reaction. Densitometric quantifications of 3-5 independently performed GTPase pull-down assays ± S.E. are shown together with representative Western blots using the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Role of Rho GTPases in Gα12/13-mediated Wound Healing—Several trimeric G-proteins are known to regulate the functions of Rho GTPases that control F-actin, microtubule, and focal adhesion dynamics. Therefore, we analyzed scratch-induced activation of Cdc42, Rac, Ras, and RhoA in Gα12/13-deficient MEFs under the applied wound assay conditions. Using immobilized PAK-CRIB peptides as a probe (19Price L.S. Langeslag M. ten Klooster J.P. Hordijk P.L. Jalink K. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39413-39421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), we found that the activities of Cdc42 and Rac were not significantly reduced during migration of wild type or Gα12/13-deficient MEFs (Fig. 2, B and C). We also directly assessed the involvement of Ras as it cooperates with RhoA to control focal adhesion turnover (20Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Ras became rapidly activated upon wounding induced migration in both wild type and Gα12/13-deficient monolayers (Fig. 2D). These data show that wounding induced Cdc42, Rac, or Ras activation does not depend on Gα12/13.To determine total RhoA activity we performed biochemical pull-down experiments using the Rho-binding domain (RBD) of rhotekin as a probe (21Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Interestingly, wounding of MEF monolayers caused a down-regulation of total RhoA activity (Fig. 2E), demonstrating that total RhoA activity is inversely regulated as compared with Cdc42, Rac, or Ras (Fig. 2). However, low levels of active RhoA appeared to be maintained during wound healing in wild type MEFs (Fig. 2E). In contrast, RhoA activity levels were found to be significantly reduced or in some cases even undetectable in Gα12/13-deficient MEFs during wounding (Fig. 2E). These results showed that wild type MEFs maintained higher levels of total active RhoA during migration, when compared with MEFs lacking Gα12/13.Specificity of a Recombinant Rho[GTP] Affinity Probe—To be able to investigate endogenous RhoA activity in more detail we performed a modified in situ Rho[GTP] affinity assay (15Berdeaux R.L. Diaz B. Kim L. Martin G.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Li Z. Aizenman C.D. Cline H.T. Neuron. 2002; 33: 741-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) for which we have generated a His-tag-purified GFP-RBD fusion protein as a probe in which the Rho-binding-domain of rhotekin was coupled to GFP and produced recombinantly. To characterize the binding properties of this fusion protein we performed in vitro pull-down assays by recoupling purified GFP-RBD to nickel beads. Starved cells were serum stimulated for 5 min and endogenous active RhoA was efficiently precipitated by GFP-RBD as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3A), clearly demonstrating the specificity of the probe for GTP-RhoA in vitro.FIGURE 3GFP-RBD recognizes active Rho in vitro and in situ. A, RhoA pull-down assay showing anti-RhoA Western blots from Rho[GTP]-affinity precipitation from MEF lysates using purified His-GFP-RBD recoupled to nickel beads with or without serum (fetal calf serum (FCS)) stimulation. Total expression of RhoA is shown (lysate). B, scratch-wounded wild type MEFs (1 h) were fixed and permeabilized before incubation with purified GFP as a control showing some background nuclear labeling. C, fibroblasts were transfected with plasmids encoding myc-tagged constitutively active RhoA (V14RhoA), myc-tagged constitutively active RhoA (V14RhoA) and C3 transferase (0.1 μg), myc-tagged dominant-negative RhoA (N19RhoA), or myc-tagged constitutively active Cdc42 (V12Cdc42) as indicated. Cells were maintained at 0.5% FBS. 24 h after transfection cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized, and in situ GTPase assays were performed using 0.02 μg/μl GFP-RBD, GFP-WASpGBD, or GFP alone (green). Colabeling was done using anti-myc-TRITC antibodies (red) and Alexa® 350 phalloidin (blue). Merged green, red, and blue channels are shown in the panel on the right. Scale bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then studied the ability of the GFP-RBD to detect active RhoA in situ. Incubation of fixed and permeabilized cells with GFP alone as a control resulted in a background signal labeling the nuclei (Fig. 3B). To control for the specificity of GFP-RBD for in situ fluorescence applications we transfected fibroblasts either with dominant negative RhoA (N19RhoA) or with a constitutively active mutant for RhoA (V14RhoA). Cells were transfected at subconfluency and serum-starved in 0.5% FBS. As expected, cells that expressed V14RhoA displayed excessive stress fiber formation and cell body contraction (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 3 cells expressing V14RhoA displayed a robust increase in signal intensity for GFP-RBD, whereas cells expressing dominant negative N19RhoA did not (Fig. 3C). In contrast, cells expressing active V14RhoA that were incubated with GFP alone displayed a nonspecific background signal labeling the nucleus as compared with non-transfected cells or cells that were maintained in 10% serum conditions (Fig. 3B). To further verify that the GFP-RBD probe only recognizes the GTP-bound conformation of RhoA, fibroblasts were cotransfected with V14RhoA and C3 exoenzyme to inactivate Rho proteins (22Grosse R. Copeland J.W. Newsome T.P. Way M. Treisman R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3050-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This resulted in a reduction of the GFP-RBD signal almost to background detection levels as compared with starved, non-transfected cells (Fig. 3C). We also transfected cells with the active form of Cdc42, V12Cdc42. Cells expressing V12Cdc42 were not detected by GFP-RBD again demonstrating the specificity of this probe for active Rho (Fig. 3C). In contrast and as an additional control, overexpression of V12Cdc42 could be strongly visualized by the addition of purified GFP-WASpGBD, a probe which we have generated to detect active Cdc42 (Fig. 3C).Absent Rho Activity at the Leading Edge of Wounded Fibroblasts Lacking Gα12/13—Because Gα12/13-deficient MEFs had reduced levels of Rho activity we decided to visualize the regulation of this GTPase in a spatial manner.

Destructive chemical approaches required to measure [InsP3] limit spatiotemporal understanding of subcellular InsP3 signaling. We constructed novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based InsP3 biosensors called FIRE (fluorescent InsP3-responsive element) by fusing plasmids encoding the InsP3-binding domain of InsP3 receptors (types 1–3) between cyan fluorescent protein and yellow fluorescent protein sequences. FIRE was expressed and characterized in COS-1 cells, cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes, and incorporated into an adenoviral vector for expression in adult cardiac ventricular myocytes. FIRE-1 exhibits an ∼11% increase in the fluorescence ratio (F530/F480) at saturating [InsP3] (apparent Kd = 31.3 ± 6.7 nm InsP3). In COS-1 cells, neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and adult cat ventricular myocytes FIRE-1 exhibited comparable dynamic range and a 10% increase in donor (cyan fluorescent protein) fluorescence upon bleach of yellow fluorescent protein, indicative of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. In FIRE-1 expressing ventricular myocytes endothelin-1, phenylephrine, and angiotensin II all produced rapid and spatially resolved increases in [InsP3] using confocal microscopy (with free [InsP3] rising to ∼30 nm). Local entry of intracellular InsP3 via membrane rupture by a patch pipette (containing InsP3)in myocytes expressing FIRE-1 allowed detailed spatiotemporal monitoring of intracellular InsP3 diffusion. Both endothelin-1-induced and direct InsP3 application (via pipette rupture) revealed that InsP3 diffusion into the nucleus occurs with a delay and blunted rise of [InsP3] versus cytosolic [InsP3].

Cell surface membrane receptor-activation of phospholipase C results in hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and the production of the second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). 3The abbreviations used are: InsP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateInsP3Rinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptorFIREfluorescent InsP3-responsive elementCFPcyan fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent proteinFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferGFPgreen fluorescent proteinntnucleotide(s)ET-1endothelin-1ROIregion(s) of interest.

The InsP3R family of calcium release channels occupies a central role in the initiation and propagation of intracellular calcium-mediated events. This signaling cascade regulates and impinges upon a wide array of cellular processes (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4451) Google Scholar, 2Bosanac I. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Despite longstanding recognition of InsP3 as an important intracellular signaling molecule (3Hokin L.E. Hokin M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 805-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hokin M.R. Hokin L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 203: 967-977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), measures of intracellular InsP3 levels have had limitations. These assays mainly either rely on whole cell extracts for mass analysis by competition binding, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and ion exchange chromatography or use metabolic measurements of radiolabeled InsP3 precursors and degradation products (5Challiss R.A. Chilvers E.R. Willcocks A.L. Nahorski S.R. Biochemical J. 1990; 265: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 6Dean N.M. Beaven M.A. Anal.

Regrettably, these methods have limited temporal resolution, are tissue destructive, and do not provide any spatial information about subcellular free InsP3 concentration and localization. Because there is increasing appreciation of local spatial compartmentalization and microdomains of intracellular signaling, the ability to measure local [InsP3] in living cells would be highly beneficial in unraveling InsP3-dependent signaling. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its variants with different spectral characteristics have allowed the development of novel biosensors that can be expressed in living cells (9Tsien R.Y. Miyawaki A. Science. 1998; 280: 1954-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Moreover, fusion proteins, which include both a cyan and yellow fluorescent protein (CFP and YFP), exhibit fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from CFP to YFP. By inserting peptide linkers that bind to biological molecules of interest, one can obtain biosensors whose FRET properties change upon binding the molecule of interest (10Miyawaki A. Llopis J.

Biol. 2004; 11: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A key approach is to use the InsP3-binding domain of the InsP3 receptor (11Tanimura A. Nezu A. Morita T. Turner R.J. Tojyo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38095-38098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), because this is one of the crucial functional targets in the cell. Here we have developed new InsP3-binding FRET-based sensors using the ligand-binding domains of the type 1, 2, and 3 InsP3R isoforms (FIRE-1, FIRE-2, and FIRE-3). We have characterized FIRE-1 and FIRE-3 in solution and in COS-1 cells exposed to agonists expected to raise InsP3 production. In cardiac myocytes the role of InsP3 signaling is unresolved, and we also use FIRE-1 to probe InsP3 in ventricular myocytes. The type 2 InsP3R (InsP3R2) isoform predominates in cardiac myocytes (15Perez P.J. Ramos-Franco J. Fill M. Mignery G.A. J. Biol.

Suematsu E. Hashimoto T. Hamachi T. Koga T. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 19Fabiato A. Biophys. J. 1986; 49: 190aGoogle Scholar, 20Nosek T.M. Williams M.F. Zeigler S.T. Godt R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C807-C811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the role of InsP3 in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and other functions is controversial (21Marks A.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 8-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 22Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force.

Physiol. 2003; 546: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In atrial myocytes some InsP3R2 is expressed in sarcoplasmic reticulum, and InsP3R-dependent calcium release can modulate excitation-contraction coupling and elicit arrythmogenesis by facilitating calcium-induced calcium release via ryanodine receptors (24Mackenzie L. Bootman M.D. Laine M. Berridge M.J. Thuring J. Holmes A. Li W.H. Lipp P. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 395-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 25Mackenzie L. Roderick H.L. Berridge M.J.

Physiol. 2004; 555: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In ventricular myocytes InsP3R are primary localized to the nuclear envelope and complex with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, which can phosphorylate InsP3R, thereby modulating its calcium channel activity (17Bare D.J. Kettlun C.S. Liang M. Bers D.M. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15912-15920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, agonist-induced InsP3 liberation and calcium release in ventricular myocytes activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and the translocation of histone deacetylases from the nucleus (27Wu X. Bossuyt J. Zhang T. Mckinsey T. Brown J.H. Olsen E.N. Bers D.M. Circulation. 2004; 110: 285PubMed Google Scholar), such that cardiac InsP3R may participate in excitation-transcription coupling. To pave the way for better understanding of InsP3 signaling in cardiac myocytes, FIRE-1 was incorporated in an adenovirus. This allowed successful tracking of agonist-induced subcellular [InsP3] changes with high spatial and temporal resolution in ventricular myocytes. Reagents—The d-myo-inositol phosphates were purchased from the following vendors: Ins(1,4,5)P3 from Alexis (San Diego, CA); Ins(2,4,5)P3 from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA); and Ins(1,4)P2, Ins(4,5)P2, and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 from A.G. Scientific (San Diego, CA). d-myo-Ins(1,4,5)P3 and adeno-phostin A were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Heparin was from Sigma-Aldrich. Construction of FIRE Plasmids—Type 1, 2, and 3 InsP3R biosensors were assembled using the individual ligand-binding domain terminally fused with enhanced CFP and YFP at the amino and carboxyl termini, respectively. The construction of the FIRE plasmids corresponding to the three InsP3R isoforms was as follows. The ligand-binding regions of each receptor isoform (18Hirata M. Suematsu E. Hashimoto T. Hamachi T. Koga T. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) encompassing the amino-terminal 604 residues (589 for the type 1 InsP3R SI- isoform) were PCR-amplified using the following oligonucleotide primer pairs: GGAGATCTCGAGCTATGTCTGACAAAATGTC/CGCGGATCCTTTCGGTTGTTGTGGAGCAG (type 1), GGAGATCTCGAGCTATGTCTGACAAAATGTC/GCCACATCTTTCTTTGCGGTTGTTGTGTAGC (type 2), and GGAGATCTCGAGCTATGAATGAAATGTCCAGC/CGCGGATCCTTTCGGTTGTTGTGGAGCAG (type 3). Rat sequences for the three isoforms corresponding to accession numbers J05510, X61677, and L06096 were used as templates for the PCRs. The PCR products from the individual InsP3R isoforms were inserted into a custom prepared pECYFP vector. This vector was constructed by linearizing pECFP-C1 (Clontech) isolated from a methylation deficient Escherichia coli strain (DM(-)) with XbaI and inserting the XbaI fragment of pEYFP (Clontech) containing the enhanced YFP coding sequence. The PCR product from the type 1 receptor ligand-binding region was digested with XhoI/BamHI and ligated into similarly digested pECYFP to form FIRE-1. The type 2 PCR product was digested with XhoI and BamHI to generate two fragments of 1566 and 255 nt. The 1566-nt fragment was ligated into XhoI/BamHI-digested pECYFP followed by the insertion of the 255-nt fragment digested with BglII (247-nt BamHI-BglII) into the BamHI site creating FIRE-2. FIRE-3 was generated by digesting the type 3-derived PCR product with XhoI/BamHI and first inserting the 1197-nt XhoI-BamHI fragment into XhoI/BamHI digested pECYFP followed by the insertion of the 3′ 622-nt BamHI fragment. Construction of FIRE-1 Adenoviral Vector—The FIRE-1 plasmid, previously described, was used as the progenitor for the FIRE-1 adenovirus (FIRE-1AdV). The adenoviral vector was constructed using a commercially available kit, the AdEasyTM XL adenoviral vector system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA.). Briefly, the terminally fluorescent tagged InsP3 ligand-binding domain was excised by digesting with NheI, Klenow repaired followed by digestion with NotI. This fragment was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of the shuttle vector (pShuttle-CMV) by digesting the vector with BglII and following Klenow repair digested with NheI to produce pShuttle-CMV-FIRE-1. The bacterial cell line BJ5183-AD-1, pretransformed with the plasmid pAdEasy-1, was used for in vivo homologous recombination with pShuttle-CMV-FIRE-1. The pAdEasy-1-FIRE-1 insert containing plasmid was transformed into DH5α and produced in bulk. Purified, AdEasy-1-FIRE-1 plasmid was used to transfect/infect AD-293 for virus amplification. FIRE-1AdV virus was plaque-purified, amplified, CsCl gradient-purified, and stored at -80 °C. COS-1 Cell Transfection—COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for FIRE-1 and FIRE-3 using a diethylaminoethyl-dextran method as previously described (28Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer 3rd, B.T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neonatal Myocyte Isolation and Transfection—Ventricular neonatal cardiac myocytes were isolated from 1–2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat hearts by enzyme digestion as described by Griffin et al. (29Griffin T.M. Valdez T.V. Mestril R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H1081-H1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Harvested cells were plated in four-well plates on 1% gelatin-coated 25-mm square coverslips (106–7 cells/well) and allowed to recover for 24–48 h in plating medium (4 parts Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/1 part medium 199, 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% antibiotic/antimyocotic). After recovery, the medium was changed to serum-free, antibiotic-free medium, and the myocytes were transfected with FIRE-1 plasmid following the method supplied by the manufacturer to transfect a 60-mm culture vessel included in the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) eukaryotic transfection kit. The cells were incubated (3% CO2 at 37 °C) for 48 h (medium changed after 24 h) prior to imaging. Antibodies—The InsP3R-specific antibodies directed against the amino termini of the InsP3R1, -2 and -3 isoforms (T1NH, T2NH, and T3NH) used in this study have been described previously (16Ramos-Franco J. Fill M. Mignery G.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 834-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 30Ramos-Franco J. Bare D. Caenepeel S. Nani A. Fill M. Mignery G. Biophys.

J. 1998; 75: 2783-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described previously (28Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer 3rd, B.T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Visualization was accomplished using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Fluorescence Measurement—FIRE-1 and FIRE-3 fluorescence measurements were performed on a Sim Aminco xenon lamp spectrofluorimeter (SLM Instruments). Monochromator excitation and emission slit widths were set at 4 nm. Excitation light was 415 nm using an excitation monochromator, and the dual photon counting emission detectors were set at 480 (F480) and 530 nm (F530), respectively. Fluorescence measurements were recorded (at 22 °C) in polystyrene cuvettes containing 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing 250–300 μg of COS-1 cell cytosol fraction expressing FIRE-1 or -3. For inositol phosphate binding experiments, increasing concentrations of inositol phosphates were added directly to the sample and rapidly mixed prior to fluorescence emission recording. Inositol phosphate binding affinity (Kd) was calculated from changes of Δ(F530/F480) or percentage changes of F530/F480 as a function of [InsP3], using nonlinear regression analysis conducted with Prizm 4.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Adult Cardiac Myocyte Culture and Adenoviral Infection—Adult cat ventricular myocytes were isolated as previously described (32Rubenstein D.S. Lipsius S.L. Circulation. 1995; 91: 201-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and seeded on laminin-coated glass coverslips, and nonadherent cells were removed after 30–45 min. Culture medium consisted of serum-free medium 199 (M199) supplemented with 25 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm creatine, 5 mm taurine, 2 mm carnitine, and 0.1 mm ascorbic acid. Insulin (100 units/ml), 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (31 μg/ml), bovine serum albumin (0.2%), and 2% penicillin-streptomycin were also added to the medium. The myocytes were then exposed to recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus expressing the FIRE-1 sensor for 2 h at an multiplicity of infection of 1–10. The myocytes were subsequently cultured for 24–36 h, and the medium was changed twice daily. Confocal Microscopy and Patch Clamping—A coverslip with cells expressing the FIRE probe was positioned to the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon) equipped with a ×40 1.3 NA oil immersion objective lens. The cells were continuously superfused with Tyrode solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2,10mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (adjusted with NaOH). Changes in FRET were measured with laser scanning confocal microscopy (Radiance 2000 MP; Bio-Rad, UK). CFP was excited with the 457-nm line of an argon ion laser. CFP and YFP emissions were measured at wavelengths 488 (F488) and >530 nm (F530), respectively. Changes in InsP3 activity were defined as the relative change in the ratio F530/F488 of the background corrected fluorescence intensities measured at the emission wavelengths of CFP and YFP. The experiments were conducted at room temperature. In experiments where myocytes were dialyzed with InsP3 (10 μm), the conventional patch-clamp technique was used. Microelectrodes had resistances of 2–4 MΩ when filled with an intracellular solution containing 100 mm potassium glutamate, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2 (adjusted with KOH). The myocytes were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of -70 mV. For intracellular calcium measurements ([Ca]i) cells were loaded for 20 min with the membrane permeant fluorescent calcium indicator fluo-4/AM (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen; 20 μm). Fluo-4 was excited with the 488-nm line of an argon ion laser, and emitted calcium-dependent fluorescence was measured at wavelengths >515 nm. [Ca]i signals are presented as background-subtracted normalized fluorescence (F/F0), where F is the fluorescence intensity, and F0 is resting fluorescence recorded under steady-state conditions at the beginning of an experiment. Construction and Expression of FRET-based Biosensor FIRE—We constructed a set of fluorescent reporter-ligand-binding domain chimeras from the type 1, 2, and 3 InsP3R isoforms terminally fused with CFP and YFP. The constructs span the receptors ligand-binding core encompassing the amino-terminal 589 residues of the type 1 (SI-) spliced form and 604 amino acids for the type 2 and 3 homologues linked amino-terminally with CFP and carboxyl-terminally with YFP. In all cases minimal linker sequences (seven residues CFP-InsP3R and eight residues for InsP3R-YFP junctions) were used to join the fluorescent proteins to the InsP3R-binding core backbone (Fig. 1A). These plasmids are named FIRE with the InsP3R isoform identified with a numeric suffix (FIRE-1, FIRE-2, and FIRE-3). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the FIRE-1, FIRE-2, and FIRE-3 plasmids, and soluble fractions were examined by western immunoblotting using InsP3R amino-terminal antibodies specific for the type 1, 2, or 3 InsP3R (16Ramos-Franco J. Fill M. Mignery G.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 834-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 30Ramos-Franco J. Bare D. Caenepeel S. Nani A. Fill M. Mignery G. Biophys.

J. 1998; 75: 2783-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, FIRE-1 was also introduced into adult ventricular myocytes using an adenoviral expression system (FIRE-1Adv). As shown in Fig. 1B, all of the constructs express at high levels as soluble proteins with an expected Mr ∼118,000. Calibrations and Selectivity—Fig. 2A shows the [InsP3] dependence of the FRET signal (expressed as change in F530/F480) for both FIRE-1 and FIRE-3 expressed in COS-1 cells. An initial parallel version using the type 2 InsP3R sequence showed expression as well but was not as good a sensor in initial screening; therefore it was not pursued further here. Cytosolic extracts from FIRE expressing COS-1 cells were suspended in cuvettes and placed in a fluorimeter. Incremental addition of InsP3 (0–10 μm) resulted in enhanced FRET over a range from 1 nm to 1 μm InsP3. Both FIRE-1 and FIRE-3 sensors exhibited ∼11% change in the fluorescence ratio with apparent Kd of 31.3 ± 6.7 nm (n = 7) and 36.4 ± 2.8 nm (n = 4), respectively. The specificity and selectivity of FIRE-1 to InsP3 (Ins(1,4,5)P3) was further examined by characterizing the response to other inositol phosphates, an InsP3R agonist, and heparin (Fig. 2B). Preincubation of the COS cytosol with heparin (5 mg/ml) followed by the addition of InsP3 resulted in essentially no change in FRET, confirming that the InsP3-induced change in fluorescent ratio is a consequence of InsP3 binding to the FIRE-1 ligand-binding region. Adenophostin A, a high affinity InsP3R agonist, showed nearly 11× higher potency (Kd = 2.9 nm, n = 4–8) and slightly less efficacy at increasing FRET (76% of the maximal ΔF530/F480 measured for Ins(1,4,5)P3). Of the inositol phosphates examined Ins(2,4,5)P3, which is often used as a more stable, poorly metabolized agonist of the InsP3R, exhibited ∼8-fold lower apparent affinity (250 nm, n = 4) for FIRE-1 than did Ins(1,4,5)P3. Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and Ins(4,5)P2 induced changes in ΔF530/F480 with apparent affinities of 563 nm (n = 3) and >14 μm, (n = 4), respectively. The primary cellular degradation product of Ins(1,4,5)P3 through the activity of InsP3-5 phosphatase (33Shears S.B. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 63-92PubMed Google Scholar), Ins(1,4)P2, did not increase FRET at any concentrations up to 100 μm (n = 4; not shown). l-myo-Ins(1,4,5)P3 induced FRET in FIRE-1 with significantly lower potency (n = 4) than the biologically relevant d-myo stereoisomer, consistent with previous reports regarding the stereo specificity of the InsP3R (34Nahorski S.R. Potter B.V.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 139-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 35Wilcox R.A. Primrose W.U. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 467-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The relative potency of these inositol phosphates are very similar to those observed in competition binding assays using NH2-terminal fragments encompassing the ligand-binding domain of the type 1 and type 2 InsP3R (36Sudhof T.C. Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Mignery G.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Additionally the interaction of these inositol phosphates with the ligand-binding region of the FIRE-1 expression product reflects the relative potency of the inositol phosphates in their ability to release calcium from InsP3-sensitive stores in cultured cells (SH-SY5Yand Swiss-3T3) (37Wilcox R.A. Challiss R.A. Liu C. Potter B.V. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 810-817PubMed Google Scholar, 38Willcocks A.L. Strupish J. Irvine R.F. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In those studies Ins(2,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 were ∼10 and ∼18 times less potent than Ins(1,4,5)P3 in releasing calcium. Thus, FIRE-1 is an excellent biosensor for signals that are expected to activate the InsP3R. Detection of [InsP3] in COS-1 Cells—The response of FIRE-1- and FIRE-3-transfected COS-1 cells to InsP3 liberating agonists were examined using confocal microscopy. Stimulation of COS-1 cells with ATP (10 μm) reveals oscillatory increases in [Ca]i (Fig. 3A) that are mediated by InsP3-dependent calcium release. In parallel experiments, the cells expressing FIRE-1 and FIRE-3 were stimulated with 10 μm ATP (Fig. 3B), resulting in a similar oscillatory increase in FRET assessed by the F530/F488 ratio (excitation at 457 nm). The maximal increase in the F530/F488 ratio induced by ATP or acetylcholine (5–6%; Fig. 3C) would correspond to free [InsP3] in the range of 20–50 nm based on the calibrations in Fig. 2A. A critical hallmark of FRET is an increase in donor (CFP) fluorescence upon bleaching of the acceptor (YFP). Fig. 4 illustrates that partial photo-bleach of YFP (with the 514-nm laser line; note the 58% decrease in YFP fluorescence) increases CFP donor fluorescence by 12% in a COS-1 cell expressing FIRE-1. Mean values for increased CFP fluorescence after YFP photobleach are 8.9 ± 1.3% (n = 8) and 8.5 ± 1.5% (n = 8) for FIRE-1 and FIRE-3, respectively. These are lower limits for the amount of basal FRET (before [InsP3] increases), because the mean extent of YFP photobleach was only 58.2 ± 3.6% (n = 8) and 54.9 ± 4.6% (n = 8), respectively. Correcting for incomplete YFP photobleach, we estimate that the basal extent of FRET is about 22.6 ± 2.1% and 17.2 ± 2.2% for FIRE-1 and -3, respectively. Detection of [InsP3] in Cardiac Myocytes—We next transfected the FIRE-1 plasmid into cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and examined whether the cells exhibited altered FRET upon stimulation with endothelin-1 (ET-1). Although the number of cells transfected was low, the cells expressing FIRE-1 were readily identifiable by their fluorescence, which as in COS-1 cells was cytosolic. Exposure of these neonatal myocytes to 100 nm ET-1 resulted in increased FRET, indicating InsP3 generation (Fig. 5). Compared with untreated controls, 100 nm ET-1 induced an 8% peak increase in the F530/F488 ratio (n = 4; Fig. 5). The InsP3-induced increase in FRET was detected within 20–25 s after addition of ET-1 and reached a maximum within 1–2 min. In the continued presence of ET-1 the F530/F488 ratio leveled off to a sustained pla"

This was corroborated by its colocalization with the raft markers cholesterol, ganglioside GM1, and PrPC. The remaining PMCA isoforms were found in the detergent-soluble fractions, with the majority of the membrane proteins.

By providing an ordered membrane microenvironment, lipid rafts may contribute to the interaction of PMCA4 with proteins involved in Ca2+ signaling at discrete functional positions on the synaptic nerve terminals.

PMCAs are encoded by at least four different genes resulting in four basic isoforms (PMCA1-4). Additional diversity in each isoform is generated by the alternative splicing of their mRNAs (reviewed in Ref. 1Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). It is clear that these pumps play major roles in Ca2+ homeostasis maintenance and participate in the local regulation of Ca2+ signaling.

The organization of biological membranes into specialized subdomains, known as lipid rafts, is an emergent source of research given their involvement in many essential cellular processes such as signal transduction (2Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar, 3Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Lipid rafts are characterized by their high content of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids and serve as suitable platforms for the assembly of protein complexes involved in signaling pathways (3Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5058) Google Scholar). In neurons, lipid rafts have been found in dendrites where they sustain a variety of postsynaptic protein complexes (5Hering H. Lin C.C. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3262-3271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, their disruption results in the depletion of excitatory and inhibitory synapses and in the loss of dendritic spines, among other processes (5Hering H. Lin C.C. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3262-3271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, accumulated evidence shows the involvement of lipid rafts in neurodegenerative diseases such as prion diseases, cerebellar ataxia, and Alzheimer disease (6Legname G. Nelken P. Guan Z.

In addition to these raft domains, others, referred to as caveolae, are marked by the presence of caveolin-1 and can share or not a solubility response to detergent similar to that of rafts (2Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar, 13Sowa G. Pypaert M. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and Western blots of caveolae isolated from the luminal rat lung endothelial cell surface using Triton X-100 (16Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Jacobson B.S. Dvorak A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) have shown the presence of PMCA in caveolae domains. In this work we have investigated the differential association of the distinct PMCA isoforms from synaptosomal plasma membranes (SPM) from pig cerebellum with lipid rafts. The analysis of Brij 96 cold extracts fractioned by gradient ultracentrifugation shows that of all PMCA, only the isoform 4 (PMCA4) appears associated with the low density and high cholesterol and the sphingomyelin content of raft fractions. This domain segregation is promoted by palmitoylation because treatment with hydroxylamine reduces its floatation properties. The differences observed in the membrane-domain segregation are likely to relate to the PMCA isoform specificity of the role that they play in cell signaling and other molecular processes. The fact that different proteins involved in neurotransmitter release have been associated with lipid rafts in the nerve terminal suggests a direct role of PMCA4 in these processes. Preparation of Synaptosomal Plasma Membrane Vesicles—SPM from adult pig cerebellum were prepared by osmotic lysis of synaptosomes as described by Salvador and Mata (17Salvador J.M. Mata A.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and stored at -80 °C until use. The protein content was measured using the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Preparation of Detergent-resistant Membranes by Floatation—The floatation assay was performed as described by Naslavsky et al. (19Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) but substituting Brij 96 (Fluka) for Triton X-100 to diminish domain mixing (20Madore N. Smith K.L. Graham C.H. Jen A. Brady K. Hall S. Morris R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6917-6926Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Essentially, 0.75 ml of SPM (7-10.5 mg of protein) in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl was treated with 0.5% Brij 96 (0.5% (w/v) final concentration) for 1 h at 4 °C with constant stirring and then enriched in 35% (w/v) Nycodenz (Sigma). A volume of 1.5 ml was placed on the bottom of an Ultracentrifuge tube, and then overlaid with 214 μl each of 25, 22.5, 20, 18, 15, 12, and 8% Nycodenz prepared in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl containing 0.5% Brij 96. After 4 h of ultracentrifugation at 260,000 × g (rotor MLS-50, OptimaMax, Beckman Instruments) at 4 °C, 13 fractions of 230 μl were collected from the top. Electrophoresis and Immunoblots—Equal volumes of each fraction were separated in 6.5% (PMCA analysis) or 13.5% (PrPC and flotillin analysis) polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli's procedure (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Proteins were either visualized with Coomassie Brillant Blue or electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a Trans-Blot® SD semidry electrotransfer system (Bio-Rad). After blocking for 30 min in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 2% (v/v) nonfat dry milk (TBS-milk), the membranes were incubated with the primary antibody for 3 h at room temperature in TBS-0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). The primary antibodies used were: pAb anti-PMCA1 (1/500, Affinity Bioreagents), pAb anti-PMCA2 (1/500, Affinity Bioreagents), pAb anti-PMCA3 (1/500, Affinity Bioreagents), mAb antibody anti-PMCA4 (1/500, Affinity Bioreagents), mAb 6H4 anti-PrP (1/3000, Prionics AG), and mAb anti-flotillin-2/ESA (1/500, BD Transduction Laboratories). The anti-PMCA4a pAb CR4a (1/200) and the anti-PMCA4b mAb JA3 (1/1000) were kindly provided by A. G. Filoteo and E. E. Strehler (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). After washing, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and stained with 4-methoxy-1-naphthol. Immunoreactive bands were quantified with the TINA software (Raytest, Straunbenhardt, Germany). Ganglioside GM1 Detection—For the lipid raft-associated ganglioside GM1, 0.5 μl of each gradient fraction was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane sealed on a dot-blot set-up (Bio-Rad). After washing with TBS-0.5% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with 6 m guanidine chloride for 5 min at room temperature and then washed extensively with TBS-0.5% Tween 20. After blocking with TBS containing 3% (w/v) defatted milk for 2 h at room temperature, membranes were incubated with the cholera toxin B subunit-HRP (1/20 000, Calbiochem) overnight at 4 °C. The detection was performed by chemoluminescence (Bio-Rad Immune-Star HRP substrate kit). The intensities of spots were quantified with the TINA software. Cholesterol Determination—Cholesterol content was determined colorimetrically using the ferric chloride reaction in a sulfuric acidacetic acid solution (22Zlatkis A. Zak B. Boyle A.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1953; 41: 486-492PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of each fraction was mixed with 80 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), and the phase containing the lipids was transferred onto a glass tube and dried with nitrogen. Cholesterol was extracted by the addition to each tube of 0.75 ml of acetic acid and 0.5 ml of ferric chloride reagent (prepared by mixing 1 ml of 2.5% (w/v) FeCl3 in 85% H3PO4 with 11.5 ml of concentrated H2SO4). The samples were incubated for 30 min, and the absorbance was read at 550 nm. Cholesterol standard solutions were used for calibration. Ca2+-ATPase Activity—The enzymatic activity was measured in 7.5 μl of each fraction by using a coupled enzyme assay as described previously (23Sepulveda M.R. Hidalgo-Sanchez M. Mata A.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 542-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The activities were measured in the presence of 100 nm thapsigargin and 5 mm sodium azide to inhibit the contamination of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and other ATPases. Calmodulin (0.32 μg/ml) was added when indicated. The membrane vesicles were permeabilized with 0.01% saponin to obtain the activity of all PMCA molecules. The reaction was started by the addition of 1 mm ATP. The PMCA activity of these fractions was obtained after subtraction of the Mg2+-ATPase activity, measured in the presence of 6 mm EGTA, and was given in μmol Pi·min-1·mg-1. Determination of Hydroxylamine Sensitivity—SPM (10 mg protein) were treated with 1 m hydroxylamine (pH 7.4) or 1 m Tris (pH 7.4) as a control for 2 h at 4°C under constant stirring. After 1 h of ultracentrifugation at 260,000 × g at 4 °C, the membrane pellets were resuspended in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, cold-extracted with Brij 96, and fractioned on a Nycodenz gradient as described above. To investigate the differential membrane domain segregation of PMCA isoforms we used cold Brij 96-extracts of SPM vesicles isolated from pig cerebellum fractioned by ultracentrifugation along a Nycodenz gradient. The choice of Brij 96 instead of Triton X-100 as detergent for the cold extraction was based on the reported improved preservation of raft entities (20Madore N. Smith K.L. Graham C.H. Jen A. Brady K. Hall S. Morris R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6917-6926Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Regarding the density gradient for the floatation fractionation, Nycodenz instead of sucrose was used to reduce the centrifugation time needed to achieve the density equilibrium, thus favoring the preservation of the functional integrity of the membrane proteins. Fractions from SPM Brij 96 extracts were first analyzed for the lipid raft markers, sphingolipid GM1 and cholesterol (Fig. 1). As described (19Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 20Madore N. Smith K.L. Graham C.H. Jen A. Brady K. Hall S. Morris R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6917-6926Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) the GM1 distribution showed the highest levels at the top of the gradient (fractions 1-4), indicating that these low density fractions were raft-enriched fractions (Fig. 1A). Similarly, cholesterol was found mainly in low density fractions 2-4 at the top of the gradient, with very low levels in the remaining fractions (Fig. 1B). As protein markers of rafts, we used both the cellular prion protein (PrPC) and flotillin (24Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 25Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that the vast majority of PrPC appeared in low density fractions 2-6, separated from most membrane proteins (Fig. 2C). Flotillin showed a broader distribution, with its highest content found in fractions 3 and 4 (Fig. 2B). This floatation distribution of markers was preserved for SPM cold detergent extractions performed at protein concentrations in the 9-14 mg/ml range.FIGURE 2Distribution of the protein raft markers PrP and flotillin (A and B) and staining of total proteins (C) along the density gradient. Typically, 11 μl of each of the 13 fractions and 30 μg of protein of nonfractionated SPM were analyzed by 13.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the anti-PrP 6H4 antibody and anti-flotillin-2/ESA (A) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Representative blots from three independent experiments with similar results are shown. B, percentage of PrP and flotillin content along the gradient fractions, as referred to the total amount of each protein raft marker. C, a similar gel, with the indicated fractions, was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The presence and distribution of PMCA in the gradient were first analyzed with an anti-PMCA antibody that recognizes all isoforms, giving a broad staining in all fractions (result not shown). Hence we used isoform-specific antibodies to identify the four PMCA isoforms along the gradient (Fig. 3A). PMCA1, -2, and -3 were detected in the non-raft high density fractions, with stronger staining for PMCA1 and -3 than for PMCA2. Interestingly, the anti-PMCA4 antibody recognized two protein bands at the top of the gradient, around low density fractions 2-4. To test whether the observed bands corresponded to both splicing variants a and b, Western blots of SPM were probed with specific anti-PMCA4a (CR4a) and anti-PMCA4b (JA3) antibodies (26Filoteo A.G. Elwess N.L. Enyedi A. Caride A. Aung H.H. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23741-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 27Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). It can be seen that each antibody identified only one band corresponding to each splice variant, whereas the anti-PMCA4 antibody stained both variants in the SPM. The quantization of PMCA1-4 bands (Fig. 3C) pointed out more precisely the bimodal distribution of PMCA isoforms along the Brij 96-Nycodenz gradient, with one peak corresponding to PMCA4 located in the low density raft fraction 3 and another peak corresponding to the other PMCA isoforms located in the high density non-raft fraction 9. Furthermore, similar, if not identical, bimodal distribution was obtained from SPM isolated from pig cerebrum (data not shown). Measurements of Ca2+-ATPase activity in all fractions (Fig. 4) showed two pools of PMCA activity that overlapped with those obtained by immunoreactivity. The incubation of membranes from each fraction with 0.32 μg/ml calmodulin showed stimulation of the activity just around fraction 3. The preferential ability of PMCA4, among all of the isoforms, to associate with lipid rafts could be the result of an intrinsic propensity; or this ability could be driven indirectly by the existence of modulatory partners that could either promote it, in the case of PMCA4, or preclude it, in the remaining isoforms. The fact that PMCA4b binds to several PDZ (PSD-95/Dig/ZO-1) proteins of the MAGUK family (28Kim E. DeMarco S.J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Sheng M. Strehler E.E. J. Biol.

Lett. 1998; 258: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), could support an indirect raft association. In fact, a ETSV (PMCA4b) to ETSL (PMCAs 1b, 2b, and 3b) sequence change in the class I PDZ-binding motif found at the C terminus could explain the distinct raft segregation among PMCA b splicing variants (28Kim E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). However, this unique PDZ-mediated association with lipid rafts cannot explain the association capacity of PMCA4a and the lack of association of PMCA2b. In this sense, PMCA4a has a shorter C-terminal domain, lacking the PDZ-binding motif (35Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Heim R. Adamo H.P. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 41-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PMCA2b has been described to interact with MAGUK proteins (29DeMarco S.J. Strehler E.E. J. Biol.

To explain this controversy we considered the possibility of raft association as an intrinsic property of PMCA4 isoform. If this would be the case, then PMCA4 should contain in its sequence a divergent difference compared with the rest of the PMCAs (Fig. 5). Among the sequence differences found, we identified two regions in which PMCA4 contains differentially a Cys residue (GLQCRIEQ in the C2 of PMCA4a/b, VDCNQ in the C6 of PMCA4b) compared with a Ser in the remaining isoforms. These Cys residues could sustain a covalent modification such as palmitoylation, which has been essential for the lipid raft localization of several transmembrane proteins (36Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 37Arni S. Keilbaugh S.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol.

To test this possibility we investigated the sensitivity of PMCA4 buoyancy to 1 m hydroxylamine, which is known to reverse protein palmitoylations (39Gubitosi-Klug R.A. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5964-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows that a pretreatment with 1 m hydroxylamine shifted the maximum of the floatation distribution of PMCA4 from fraction 3 to 9 compared with the control performed with 1 m Tris, whereas that of PMCA2 and the other isoforms remained unchanged at fraction 9.FIGURE 6Hydroxylamine sensitivity of PMCA isoforms.

Empty and gray bars correspond to 1 m Tris and 1 m hydroxylamine pretreatments, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This study shows for the first time that the cerebellar PMCA4 isoform, but not the other PMCA isoforms, is specifically associated with the low density membrane domains from SPM that exhibit high cholesterol and GM1 content and similar floatation properties to the raft-associated proteins PrPC and flotillin. Interestingly, this association is sensitive to hydroxylamine, indicating protein palmitoylation as a driving force (40el-Husseini Ael D. Bredt D.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Membrane microdomains, such as the so-called lipid rafts, function as segregation platforms to concentrate different molecules and assemble them into efficient signal transduction machineries (2Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar, 41Simons K. Ikonen E.

An increasing number of kinases and others proteins appear to use this strategy for best working in signal cascades (43Foster L.J. De Hoog C.L. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5813-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). In neurons, lipid rafts were first thought to be restricted to the axonal compartment (44Ledesma M.D. Simons K. Dotti C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3966-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), although later it was shown that several postsynaptic proteins located in dendrites are also associated to rafts (5Hering H. Lin C.C. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3262-3271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that in pig cerebellum the PMCA is present in the plasma membrane of the soma of Purkinje cells as well as in areas enclosing many synapses, such as in cerebellar glomeruli and dendritic spines of Purkinje cell arborization (23Sepulveda M.R. Hidalgo-Sanchez M. Mata A.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 542-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, this pattern was not discriminative regarding the specific isoforms because the analysis was done with an antibody that recognized all PMCA isoforms. The presence of lipid rafts in SPMs was evidenced in the low density fractions of a gradient ultracentrifugation of cold detergent extract, on the basis of the high content of the lipid markers cholesterol and sphingolipid GM1 and the protein markers PrPC and flotillin (19Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 20Madore N. Smith K.L. Graham C.H. Jen A.

The immunodetection of PMCA proteins using specific antibodies showed that only the PMCA4 isoform appears associated in raft, whereas the PMCA isoforms 1, 2, and 3 emerge in the high density non-raft fractions located closer to the bottom of the gradient, where the majority of the proteins were found. The distribution of PMCA isoforms in two different portions of the gradient was corroborated by functional assays. The lower PMCA activity found in fraction 3 with respect to fraction 9 and its stimulation by calmodulin agrees with the presence of PMCA4 in that fraction, because this isoform has the lowest basal activity and the greatest stimulation by calmodulin among isoforms (46Elwess N.L.

Penniston J.T. Enyedi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35798-35804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The low level or even the lack of calmodulin stimulation found in fractions 3 and 9, respectively, could be expected, provided that PMCA isoforms are already activated by the presence of a high content of phosphatydylserine in SPM from the cerebellum as it has been reported in brain (17Salvador J.M. Mata A.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the synaptosomal PMCA activity from pig brain is ganglioside-dependent (48Zhao Y. Fan X. Yang F. Zhang X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 427: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), as the activity is reduced by GM1 and to a greater extent by GM2 and GM3. Thus, the high content of gangliosides in the same fraction as PMCA4 (Figs. 1 and 3) may also account for the lower activity found in fraction 3 with respect to fraction 9. Our activity results about the corresponding decrease of PMCA activity with the increase of sphingomyelin and cholesterol content in reconstituted pig brain PMCA are in good agreement with those reported by Pang et al. (49Pang Y. Zhu H. Wu P. Chen J. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2397-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The distribution pattern of PMCA isoforms was observed in SPM isolated not only from cerebellum but also from cerebrum, giving a more general than regional view on the process. Screening for molecular determinants of raft association in PMCA4 revealed the presence of isoform-specific Cys residues in regions corresponding to the C2 and C6 cytoplasmic loops, susceptible a priori of being palmitoylated. The key role of this covalent modification was evidenced in the reduction of PMCA4 buoyancy after treatment with 1 m hydroxylamine. However, it must be kept in mind that the accurate attribution of this modification to PMCA4 instead to a second, yet unidentified, partner will require further experimentation. Although the physiological relevance of PMCA4 in rafts has not been established, it is tempting to speculate on the advantages of this process. Given that, among all isoforms, PMCA4b has the lowest basal activity but the highest stimulation by calmodulin (50Caride A.J. Penheiter A.R. Filoteo A.G. Bajzer Z. Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39797-39804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that PMCA4b might be actively involved in the development, shaping, and duration of the Ca2+ signal (47Padanyi R.

Such a scenario agrees with a preferential localization at a definite membrane domain as rafts (see Fig. 7) in which a Ca2+ signaling event must be a very tightly regulated process. We thank José A.

https://openalex.org/W2025341860,"We have previously reported that Saccharomyces cerevisiae has three glutathione peroxidase homologues (GPX1, GPX2, and GPX3) (Inoue, Y., Matsuda, T., Sugiyama, K., Izawa, S., and Kimura, A. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 27002–27009). Of these, the GPX2 gene product (Gpx2) shows the greatest similarity to phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase. Here we show that GPX2 encodes an atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxin which uses thioredoxin as an electron donor. Gpx2 was essentially in a reduced form even in mutants defective in glutathione reductase or glutaredoxin under oxidative stressed conditions. On the other hand, Gpx2 was partially oxidized in a mutant defective in cytosolic thioredoxin (trx1Δtrx2Δ) under non-stressed conditions and completely oxidized in tert-butyl hydroperoxide-treated cells of trx1Δtrx2Δ and thioredoxin reductase-deficient mutant cells. Alanine scanning of cysteine residues of Gpx2 revealed that an intramolecular disulfide bond was formed between Cys37 and Cys83 in vivo. Gpx2 was purified to determine whether it functions as a peroxidase that uses thioredoxin as an electron donor in vitro. Gpx2 reduced H2O2 and tert-butyl hydroperoxide in the presence of thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH (for H2O2, Km = 20 μm, kcat = 9.57 × 102 s-1; for tert-butyl hydroperoxide, Km = 62.5 μm, kcat = 3.68 × 102 s-1); however, it showed remarkably less activity toward these peroxides in the presence of glutathione, glutathione reductase, and NADPH. The sensitivity of yeast cells to tert-butyl hydroperoxide was found to be exacerbated by the co-existence of Ca2+, a tendency that was most obvious in gpx2Δ cells. Although the redox state of Gpx2 was not affected by Ca2+, the Gpx2 level was markedly increased in the presence of both tert-butyl hydroperoxide and Ca2+. Gpx2 is likely to play an important role in the protection of cells from oxidative stress in the presence of Ca2+. We have previously reported that Saccharomyces cerevisiae has three glutathione peroxidase homologues (GPX1, GPX2, and GPX3) (Inoue, Y., Matsuda, T., Sugiyama, K., Izawa, S., and Kimura, A. (1999) J.

Gpx2 is likely to play an important role in the protection of cells from oxidative stress in the presence of Ca2+. Compared with anaerobic organisms, aerobic organisms produce energy (ATP) more efficiently because of the electron transfer system in mitochondria. At the final step in the electron transfer process, molecular oxygen (O2) accepts four electrons and is reduced to H2O by cytochrome c oxidase. In the electron transfer system as well as normal metabolism in the cytoplasm, a portion of O2 remains in an insufficient state in reduction, which in turn is referred to as reactive oxygen species. Organisms of all types possess antioxidant systems, and the diversity of the systems is of interest in terms of understanding the evolution of organisms. Superoxide dismutase catalyzes the disproportionation of superoxide anion radicals (O2·¯) to O2 and H2O2 and has been found in a wide variety of organisms. Because H2O2 generated by the superoxide dismutase reaction is still reactive oxygen species, organisms have been armed with many antioxidant enzymes that can scavenge H2O2. Catalase decomposes H2O2 to H2O and O2, whereas peroxidase reduces H2O2 to H2O using various reducing powers. For example, ascorbic acid is used by ascorbate peroxidase in plants, and glutathione (GSH) 2The abbreviations used are: GSHglutathioneTRXthioredoxinGPxglutathione peroxidasecGPxcytosolic GPxPHGPxphospholipid hydroperoxide GPxgiGPxgastrointestinal GPxpGPxplasma GPxeGPxepididymis-specific secretory GPxSeCysselenocysteinePrxperoxiredoxinTPxthioredoxin peroxidaset-BHPtert-butyl hydroperoxideAMS4′-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidWTwild typeYPDyeast extract/peptone/dextrose. is used by glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in mammals. We have cloned three GPx homologue genes (GPX1, GPX2, and GPX3) from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis of each gene product revealed that yeast GPxs are similar to mammalian phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) (2Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In mammalian GPxs, selenocysteine (SeCys) is conserved at the active site of the enzyme, whereas in such GPx homologues Cys is conserved corresponding to the position of SeCys in mammalian GPxs (1Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In the GPx reaction, oxidized SeCys (SeCys-OH) is reduced by glutathione (GSH), and the glutathione disulfide (oxidized glutathione, GSSG) thus formed is reduced to GSH by glutathione reductase using NADPH as a reducing power. It has been reported that the conversion of SeCys to Cys in mammalian GPx reduces the enzyme activity drastically (3Rocher C. Lalanne J.L. Chaudiere J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 4Maiorino M. Aumann K.D. Brigelius-Flohe R. Doria D. van den Heuvel J. McCarthy J. Roveri A. Ursini F. Flohe L. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar); therefore, the catalytic mechanism of such non-SeCys-type GPx homologues, including yeast GPxs, is of considerable interest. glutathione thioredoxin glutathione peroxidase cytosolic GPx phospholipid hydroperoxide GPx gastrointestinal GPx plasma GPx epididymis-specific secretory GPx selenocysteine peroxiredoxin thioredoxin peroxidase tert-butyl hydroperoxide 4′-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid wild type yeast extract/peptone/dextrose. A series of peroxidases referred to as peroxiredoxins (Prxs) have been found from lower prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes, and from Archaea, and they constitute a large family (5Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohe L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). There are several common features of Prxs, i.e. these enzymes do not have redox cofactors such as metal and prosthetic group and contain conserved Cys residue(s). Depending on the number of Cys residues conserved, Prxs are basically divided into two groups, 1-Cys Prx and 2-Cys Prx. In both types of Prx, the N-terminal Cys is absolutely conserved, which is sometimes called the “peroxidatic” cysteine (Cys-SPH) (6Trivelli X. Krimm I. Ebel C. Verdoucq L. Prouzet-Mauléon V. Chartier Y. Tsan P. Lauquin G. Meyer Y. Lancelin J.-M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14139-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the 1-Cys Prx reaction, Cys-SPH is oxidized to cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys-SPOH) through the reduction of H2O2 to H2O, and the Cys-SPOH formed is reduced to Cys-SPH by an unknown reducing agent. In many 1-Cys Prxs, TRX serves as the endogenous reducing agent. By contrast to the 1-Cys Prx, the 2-Cys Prx has a second conserved Cys in the C terminus, which is sometimes called the “resolving” cysteine (Cys-SRH) (6Trivelli X. Krimm I. Ebel C. Verdoucq L. Prouzet-Mauléon V. Chartier Y. Tsan P. Lauquin G. Meyer Y. Lancelin J.-M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14139-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because Cys-SPOH is unstable, it undergoes further oxidation to yield cysteine sulfinic acid (Cys-SPOOH), the formation of which turns 2-Cys Prx inactive as a peroxidase. Hence, sulfiredoxin recovers Cys-SPOOH to Cys-SPH. Alternatively, the Cys-SPOH is attacked by the Cys-SRH of another monomer to form intermolecular disulfide bonds, and these disulfide bridges are reduced by TRX. Due to the reducing agent in the peroxidase reaction, Prx is also referred to as the thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx). S. cerevisiae has five Prx/TPx genes, i.e. TSA1, TSA2, AHP1, DOT5, and PRX1 (7Park S.G. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol.

Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). They proposed that Cys36 of Gpx3, which corresponds to the position of SeCys in mammalian GPx (1Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), is oxidized to Cys36-SOHbyH2O2, and Cys598 of Yap1, which is located in the C terminus cysteine-rich domain (c-CRD) overlapping the nuclear export signal of this b-ZIP transcription factor (11Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 12Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), attacks Cys36-SOH to form a mix disulfide between Gpx3 and Yap1. Subsequently, the intermolecular disulfide bridge is reduced by Cys303 of Yap1, which is located in the n-CRD, and consequently, the intramolecular disulfide bond within Yap1 is formed, and Gpx3 is reverted to the reduced form. Additionally, if Yap1 is absent, the Cys82 within the same monomer of Gpx3 attacks the Cys36-SOH to form an intramolecular disulfide bond, and this disulfide bond is reduced by TRX. As a result, a TRX-dependent peroxidase reaction is accomplished. This mode of disulfide bridge formation during a peroxidase reaction (intramolecular disulfide bond) is the atypical 2-Cys Prx; however, again, the Gpx3 of S. cerevisiae is a homologue of GPx but not Prx. In the present study we demonstrate that Gpx2 is an atypical 2-Cys Prx. We show that the redox state of Gpx2 is maintained by a TRX-dependent system in vivo. We also show that the purified Gpx2 exhibits TRX-dependent peroxidase activity toward H2O2 and t-BHP in the presence of thioredoxin reductase and NADPH in vitro but exhibits low peroxidase activity in the presence of GSH, glutathione reductase, and NADPH. The alanine scanning of cysteine residues of Gpx2 revealed that Cys37 and Cys83 seem to contribute to the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond as a result of the peroxidase reaction. We also show that Gpx2 is important in the response to oxidative stress in the presence of calcium.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2833-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended with 40 μl of sample buffer (80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 6 m urea, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) containing 20 mm AMS. A small portion (∼4 μl) of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) was added to adjust the pH of the sample, and the mixture was boiled for 2 min. Twenty microliters of the sample was subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-Gpx2 antibody to determine the redox state of Gpx2. Western Blotting—After SDS-PAGE, separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore). Anti-Gpx2 antibody and anti-yeast TRX antibody raised in rabbits were described previously (15Izawa S. Maeda K. Sugiyama K. Mano J. Inoue Y. Kimura A. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) was used as the secondary antibody. Alanine Scanning of Cysteine Residues of Gpx2—PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was employed to introduce point mutations corresponding to the Cys residues of GPX2. The first PCR was performed with the following primers: GPX2–1 (5′-TTACCGTTGTCGACCTTGCTCTAC-3′) (18Tsuzi D. Maeta K. Takatsume Y. Izawa S. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) plus the mutagenesis primer (reverse primer; e.g. GPX2-CA1R) and GPIR-1 (5′-GATCAAGCGTGTCGACATGCAACAAGAGGC-3′) (1Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) plus the mutagenesis primer (forward primer; e.g. GPX2-CA1-F). The primers used for mutagenesis were as follows: GPX2-CA1F, 5′-GATTTAGAAGCCAAGGACAAGAAAG-3′; GPX2-CA2F, 5′-TTGCCTCCAAGGCCGGCTTCACGCC-3′; GPX2-CA3F, 5′-TGGGGTTCCCGGCCAATCAGTTCGG-3′; GPX2-CA4F, 5′-CGGAATTTGCGCAGTTGAATTATGG-3′; GPX2-CA1R, 5′-CTTTCTTGTCCTTGGCTTCTAAATC-3′; GPX2-CA2R, GGCGTGAAGCCGGCCTTGGAGGCAA-3′; GPX2-CA3R, 5′-CCGAACTGATTGGCCGGGAACCCCA-3′; GPX2-CA4R, 5′-CCATAATTCAACTGCGCAAATTCCG-3′. CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4 correspond to Cys10, Cys37, Cys65, and Cys83, respectively. The last letter of each primer name represents the direction of the primer; i.e. F and R for forward and reverse, respectively. The plasmid carrying the promoter, open reading frame, and 3′-untranslated region of GPX2 in pRS415 (pRS415-GPX2–1), of which the GPX2 gene was cloned by PCR with primers GPX2–1 and GPIR-1, was used as template DNA. The PCR products amplified by each primer set were combined, subjected to a second PCR with GPX2–1 and GPIR-1, digested with SalI (the corresponding sequence is underlined in GPX2–1 and GPIR-1), and then introduced into the SalI site of pRS415 to generate a series of Cys → Ala mutants. The resultant plasmids were named pRS415-GPX2C10A-1, pRS415-GPX2C37A-1, pRS415-GPX2C65A-1, and pRS415-GPX2C83A-1. Each mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of Gpx2 from Escherichia coli—The GPX2 gene containing a translational initiation codon and a stop codon was amplified with the following primers: GPX2-Nde, 5′-AAGTAATAATTCCATATGACCACATCTTT-3′; GPX2-Bam, 5′-TGTATTATTTATGGATCCGGATAATTGCTT-3′. GPX2-Nde and GPX2-Bam were designed to contain an NdeI site and BamHI site (underlined), respectively. The resultant fragment was digested by NdeI and BamHI and cloned into the NdeI and BamHI site of the vector pET-15b (Novagen). The resultant plasmid (pET-GPX2) was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). The expression of GPX2 was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the His-tagged Gpx2 was purified with a Ni2+-chelating column. Subsequently, the His tag was removed by digestion with thrombin. The digested mixture was again passed through the Ni2+-chelating column to purify His tag-free Gpx2 protein. The purified Gpx2 was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and used for the enzyme assay. Thioredoxin Peroxidase Assay—The reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.3 mm NADPH, 4 μm yeast thioredoxin II (Calbiochem), 2 μm yeast thioredoxin reductase (Calbiochem), and 1 μg of purified Gpx2 was incubated at room temperature for 1 min, and then 0.3 mm H2O2 or 0.1 mm t-BHP was added (total volume, 120 μl). One hundred microliters of the mixture was transferred to a micro cuvette, and the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (A340) was monitored for 10 min. For a blank, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) was used instead of the purified Gpx2. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme oxidizing 1 μmol of NADPH/min using 6.22 mm-1 cm-1 as a millimolar extinction coefficient for NADPH. Glutathione Peroxidase Assay—The reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.3 mm NADPH, 3 mm reduced glutathione, 8.3 units/ml yeast glutathione reductase (Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd.), and 1 μg of purified Gpx2 was incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and then 0.3 mm H2O2 or 0.8 mm t-BHP was added (total volume, 120 μl). One hundred microliters of the mixture was transferred to a micro-cuvette, and the decrease in A340 was monitored for 10 min. For a blank, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) was used instead of the purified Gpx2. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme oxidizing 1 μmol of NADPH/min using 6.22 mm-1 cm-1 as a millimolar extinction coefficient for NADPH. In Vitro Oxidation of Gpx2—In vitro oxidation of the purified Gpx2 was carried out essentially as described by Ursini et al. (19Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified Gpx2 was first reduced by incubating with 2-mercaptoethanol and passed through a gel filtration column. Hydrogen peroxide (final concentration, 0.1, 1.0, or 10 mm) was added to the enzyme solution, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The sample was subjected to reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained for proteins with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Survival Test—Cells were cultured in YPD medium until the A610 reached 0.5 and treated with 3 mm t-BHP, 200 mm CaCl2, or 3 mm t-BHP plus 200 mm CaCl2 at 28 °C. At the prescribed time, a portion of the cell suspension was withdrawn, diluted with a sterilized 0.85% NaCl solution, and spread onto YPD agar plates. Cells were cultured at 28 °C for 2 days, and viable cells were counted. Spot Assay—gpx3Δ cells carrying pRS413 or pRSGPX2–3H (pRS413+GPX2–3), which carry the GPX2 overexpression allele, were cultured in SD minimal medium until the A610 reached 0.5. Cells were diluted with a sterilized 0.85% NaCl solution and spotted on to SD agar plates containing H2O2 or t-BHP. Phylogenetic Analysis—The multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis were done using DNASIS Version 3.5 (Hitachi Software Engineering). Determination of Redox State of Gpx2 with AMS Modification Assay— If the peroxidase reaction is carried out by Gpx2, the sulfhydryl group of the active site Cys would be initially oxidized to cysteine sulfenic acid. To accomplish the catalytic cycle of the peroxidase reaction in vivo, there are two pathways to regenerate the sulfhydryl group at the active site Cys, i.e. (i) directly via an endogenous reducing agent such as GSH or TRX, or (ii) by generating a disulfide bond with another sulfhydryl group intramolecularly or intermolecularly and, subsequently, resolving the disulfide bridge thus formed with a protein-disulfide oxidoreductase such as TRX or glutaredoxin. We determined the redox state of Gpx2 in yeast cells using the AMS modification assay. AMS modifies the sulfhydryl group of a protein irreversibly. Because the molecular weight of AMS is ∼500, the apparent molecular weight of Gpx2 will increase by 500 with every modification of a Cys residue in Gpx2. Indeed, because Gpx2 has four Cys residues, the complete modification of all Cys residues of Gpx2 with AMS (which means Gpx2 is in the reduced form) results in an increase of 2000 in the apparent molecular weight. To verify the validity of the AMS modification assay, we measured the mobility shift of purified Gpx2 after treatment with AMS in non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The molecular weight of Gpx2 deduced from the amino acid sequence is 18,406. As shown in Fig. 1A, the molecular mass of unmodified Gpx2 was estimated to be ∼18 kDa. After treatment with AMS, the apparent molecular mass was estimated to be 20 kDa, suggesting that all Cys residues of Gpx2 were modified with AMS. We confirmed it by titration of remaining Cys residues with 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Hence, the AMS-modified Gpx2, i.e. Gpx2 in reduced form (Gpx2red), migrated slowly in non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Redox State of Gpx2 in Mutants Defective in Glutathione Recycling— In the GPx reaction GSH is used as an endogenous electron donor, and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is reduced by glutathione reductase. Therefore, if the recycling of GSH is impaired, the catalytic cycle of GPx will be arrested. S. cerevisiae has a single glutathione reductase encoded by GLR1 (20Collinson L.P. Dawes I.W. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and therefore, the redox ratio of GSSG to total glutathione in glr1Δ cells increased 3-fold compared with that of wild-type cells due to the impairment of the recycling of GSH (21Izawa S. Maeda K. Miki T. Mano J. Inoue Y. Kimura A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 1B, Gpx2 was essentially in the reduced form in wild-type as well as in glr1Δ cells even under conditions of oxidative stress. The oxidized Gpx2 (Gpx2ox) in a trx1Δtrx2Δ mutant was shown as a control (details are described in Fig. 1C and corresponding description). Glutaredoxin is one of the protein-disulfide oxidoreductases that catalyze the reduction of disulfide bonds of proteins using GSH as a reducing power. We determined the redox state of Gpx2 in a glutaredoxin-deficient mutant (grx1Δgrx2Δ) in the presence or absence of oxidative stress, although Gpx2 was virtually in the reduced form (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the redox regulation of Gpx2 is not likely regulated by a GSH-dependent system in vivo. Redox State of Gpx2 in Mutants Defective in Thioredoxin—Besides glutaredoxin, TRX is also a small enzyme that functions as a protein-disulfide oxidoreductase. In many Prxs, TRX serves as the endogenous reducing power. In addition, some kinds of GPx have been reported to use TRX as a reducing power (22Bjornstedt M. Xue J. Huang W. Akesson B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29382-29384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Takebe G. Yarimizu J. Saito Y. Hayashi T. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Nagasawa S. Takahashi K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6366-6373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Both Trx1 and Trx2 are basically cytosolic residents (15Izawa S. Maeda K. Sugiyama K. Mano J. Inoue Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28459-28465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), whereas Trx3 is located in mitochondria (25Pedrajas J.R. Kosmidou E.

We disrupted each of the three TRXs and determined the redox states of Gpx2 in the resultant mutant, although no distinct difference in the redox state was observed in a single mutant of each TRX even under conditions of oxidative stress (data not shown, result for trx3Δ is shown in Fig. 1C). However, in a cytosolic TRX-deficient mutant (trx1Δtrx2Δ), a small proportion of Gpx2 was in the oxidized form under non-stressed conditions, and a large amount of Gpx2ox appeared after the treatment with H2O2, t-BHP, and cumene hydroperoxide (Figs. 1, B and C). We examined the effect of H2O2 and t-BHP concentrations on the redox state of Gpx2 in trx1Δtrx2Δ cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, Gpx2 was oxidized with 0.1 mm H2O2, and at >0.4 mm H2O2, the proportion of Gpx2ox exceeded 40%. Regarding the redox of Gpx2 in t-BHP-treated cells, 0.2 mm t-BHP completely oxidized Gpx2 in trx1Δtrx2Δ cells; however, Gpx2 was mostly in the reduced form in wild-type cells even if 1.0 mm t-BHP was present. At lower concentrations of t-BHP (<50 μm), the proportion of Gpx2ox in trx1Δtrx2Δ cells was gradually increased in accordance with the concentrations of t-BHP (Fig. 2A, inset). We also monitored the time course of Gpx2 oxidation in trx1Δtrx2Δ cells after the tr"

In vitro, LMP1 activates numerous signaling pathways including p38, c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and NF-κB through interactions with tumor necrosis receptor-associated factors (TRAFs). These pathways are frequently activated in EBV-associated malignancies, although their activation cannot be definitively linked to LMP1 expression in vivo. In this study, interactions between LMP1 and TRAFs and the activation of PI3K/Akt, JNK, p38, and NF-κB were examined in LMP1 transgenic mice. LMP1 co-immunoprecipitated with TRAFs 1, 2, and 3. Akt, JNK, and p38 were activated in LMP1-positive and -negative splenocytes as well as LMP1-positive and -negative lymphomas. Multiple forms of NF-κB were activated in healthy splenocytes from LMP1 transgenic mice, in contrast to healthy splenocytes from LMP1-negative mice. However, in both LMP1-positive and -negative lymphomas, only the oncogenic NF-κB c-Rel, was specifically activated. Similarly to EBV-associated malignancies, p53 protein was detected at high levels in the transgenic lymphomas, although mutations were not detected in the p53 gene. These data indicate that NF-κB is activated in LMP1-positive healthy splenocytes; however, NF-κB c-Rel is specifically activated in both the transgenic lymphomas and in the rare lymphomas that develop in negative mice. The LMP1-mediated activation of NF-κB may contribute to the specific activation of c-Rel and lead to the increased development of lymphoma in the LMP1 transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W1976116300,"Mutation or epigenetic silencing of mismatch repair genes, such as MLH1 and MSH2, results in microsatellite instability (MSI) in the genome of a subset of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs). However, little is yet known of genes that directly contribute to tumor formation in such cancers. To characterize MSI-dependent changes in gene expression, we have now compared transcriptomes between fresh CRC specimens positive or negative for MSI (n=10 for each) with the use of high-density oligonucleotide microarrays harboring >44,000 probe sets. Correspondence analysis of the expression patterns of isolated MSI-associated genes revealed that the transcriptome of MSI+ CRCs is clearly distinct from that of MSI- CRCs. Such MSI-associated genes included that for AXIN2, an important component of the WNT signaling pathway. AXIN2 was silenced, apparently as a result of extensive methylation of its promoter region, specifically in MSI+ CRC specimens. Forced expression of AXIN2, either by treatment with 5'-azacytidine or by transfection with AXIN2 cDNA, resulted in rapid cell death in an MSI+ CRC cell line. These data indicate that epigenetic silencing of AXIN2 is specifically associated with carcinogenesis in MSI+ CRCs."
https://openalex.org/W2084871480,"Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) has many cellular functions and is a major factor in hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma caused by HBV infection. A proteomic approach was used to search for HBx-interacting proteins in order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis. HBx was attached to myc and flag tags (MEF tags) and expressed in 293T cells; the protein complex formed within the cells was purified and characterized by mass spectrometry. COP9 signalosome (CSN) subunits 3 and 4 were subsequently identified as HBx-interacting proteins. In addition, CSN subunit 5, Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1), was shown to be a novel cellular target of HBx. In vivo and in vitro interactions between HBx and Jab1 were confirmed by standard immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. An analysis of HBx deletion constructs showed that amino acids 30-125 of HBx were responsible for binding to Jab1. Confocal laser microscopy demonstrated that HBx was mainly localized in the cytoplasm, while Jab1 was found mainly in the nucleus and partially in the cytoplasm, and that the two proteins colocalized in the cytoplasm. The cotransfection of HBx and Jab1 resulted in substantial activator protein 1 (AP-1) activation and knockdown of endogenous Jab1 attenuated AP-1 activation caused by HBx. In addition, the coexpression of HBx and Jab1 potentiated phosphorylation of JNK, leading to the subsequent phosphorylation of c-Jun, whereas the level of c-Jun and JNK phosphorylation induced by HBx was decreased in Jab1 knockdown cells. These results suggest that the interaction between HBx and Jab1 enhances HBx-mediated AP-1 activation."

The addition of DSB to purified immature viral cores inhibited the cleavage of Gag at the CA-SP1 junction in vitro, thus reproducing the effect of the drug when present during maturation of HIV-1 particles.

Retroviruses assemble as immature particles that must undergo proteolytic maturation to become infectious. For HIV-1, maturation involves cleavage of the Gag polyprotein (henceforth referred to as “Gag”) by the viral protease, releasing the mature processed proteins MA, CA, NC, and p6 (reviewed in Ref. 1Vogt V.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 214: 95-131PubMed Google Scholar). The uncleaved Gag molecule also contains two spacer peptides, SP1 and SP2, which separate CA from NC and NC from p6, respectively. Cleavage of Gag occurs at specific sites between these proteins, and the cleavages occur at different rates, with the slowest step being the release of SP1 from the C terminus of CA (2Erickson-Viitanen S.

Swanstrom R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4528-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This final processing event is essential for HIV-1 particles to become infectious; mutations preventing release of SP1 result in non-infectious particles lacking the mature conical capsid required for early post-entry steps in infection (4Wiegers K. Rutter G. Kottler H. Tessmer U. Hohenberg H. Krausslich H.-G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2846-2854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

This compound was originally identified as a chemical derivative of betulinic acid, a plant-derived natural product, and was shown to potently inhibit HIV-1 replication (8Kashiwada Y. Hashimoto F.

DSB is active against a wide variety of HIV-1 isolates, including viruses that are resistant to drugs that target PR. Similar to PR inhibitors, DSB acts late in the virus life cycle, resulting in incompletely matured HIV-1 particles that are poorly infectious. However, the mechanism of DSB is distinct from that of drugs that inhibit the protease directly and thus prevent cleavage of all of its substrates. By contrast, DSB inhibits processing of a single cleavage site in the Gag polyprotein, the CA-SP1 junction. The specificity of DSB is determined by the sequence of the CA-SP1 junction, suggesting that the target of the drug is the viral Gag protein itself (10Zhou J. Chen C.H. Aiken C. Retrovirology. 2004; 1: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, DSB is inactive toward HIV-1 PR in vitro, even when recombinant HIV-1 Gag is the substrate. As a result, the biochemical target of DSB has not been defined. Here we report that DSB was specifically incorporated into immature HIV-1 particles at a 1:1 stoichiometry with Gag. Mutations in the CA-SP1 junction of Gag that conferred viral resistance to DSB also prevented the association of the drug with particles. The addition of DSB to purified immature HIV-1 cores inhibited cleavage of Gag at the CA-SP1 junction by PR in vitro, recapitulating the effects of the drug on HIV-1 maturation. These data suggest that DSB inhibits maturation by associating with a binding site formed by oligomerization of Gag during the assembly of HIV-1 particles. Interference with virion maturation by specific association with Gag during virus assembly represents a novel mechanism for pharmacologic inhibition of HIV-1 replication. Cells and Viruses—293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The viruses used in this study were based on the wild-type HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3 (11Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J.

PR-defective versions of the SIV constructs were generated by engineering mutations in the PR coding region, resulting in substitutions of Asp→Ala and Thr→Ala at positions 134 and 135 of the Pol protein. These substitutions resulted in the release of immature SIV particles containing the unprocessed Gag protein. 3J. Zhou and C. Aiken, unpublished observations. All PCR-amplified regions were sequenced to verify the correct substitutions and the absence of any additional mutations. Virus-containing supernatants were harvested 36-48 h after transfection of 293T cells and were clarified by passing through 0.45-μm cellulose acetate syringe filters. For production of viruses in the presence of DSB, 24-36 h prior to harvesting, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium to which the drug was added from a 1 mg/ml stock solution in Me2SO to the desired final concentrations. Virus stocks were quantified by p24 antigen capture ELISA (16Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Methods. 1997; 12: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) after heating in 1% SDS to disrupt immature virions (17Wyma D.J. Jiang J. Shi J. Zhou J. Lineberger J.E. Miller M.D. Aiken C. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3429-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Sucrose Density Gradient Purification of HIV-1 Particles—Supernatants of transfected 293T cells were concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a layer of 20% sucrose at 100,000 × g for 2 h. Virions were resuspended in STE buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and purified by equilibrium ultracentrifugation (17 h at 32,000 rpm in a Beckman SW32Ti rotor) on linear density gradients of 30-70% sucrose in STE. Fractions (1 ml volume) were harvested, and virions were pelleted after the addition of 0.5 ml of STE to reduce the solution density. Viral pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and assayed for the presence of p24 and DSB. LC/MS-based Assay of DSB—To quantify the levels of DSB present in HIV-1 particles, suspensions of virions were extracted with 2 ml of a 3:1 (v/v) solution of chloroform and methanol. Prior to extraction, a fixed quantity (50 pmol) of a betulinic acid derivative (LH91; compound 4 in Ref 9Hashimoto F. Kashiwada Y. Cosentino L.M. Chen C.H. Garrett P.E. Lee K.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) was added as an internal control for extraction efficiency. LH91 has an additional CH2 in the side chain of DSB, thus allowing for simultaneous detection of both molecules by mass spectrometry. The organic layer was collected and dried by evaporation under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The dried samples were dissolved in methanol (100 μl), and samples were analyzed by tandem LC/MS with electrospray ionization using a ThermoElectron Quantum Discovery triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in the selected reaction monitoring mode. The instrument was operated in negative ion mode using nitrogen for both the sheath nebulizing gas and auxiliary drying gas. The ion transfer capillary was maintained at 325 °C, and 15 electron volts of ion source collision-induced dissociation energy was used to facilitate solvent declustering. The primary ionization gave simple molecular anions [M - H]1- for both DSB and the internal standard LH91. Collision-induced dissociation was conducted using argon as the collision gas with 42 electron volts of collision energy. Under these tandem MS conditions, the primary fragmentation process was the loss of the acyl group as either a neutral species or as a low mass anion (Fig. 1A). Chromatographic separations were done on a XDB C8 reversed phase column (2.1 × 150 mm) from Agilent Technologies using an acetonitrile:isopropanol:water gradient with 20 mm ammonium formate at pH 6.3. Quantitative studies were conducted using selected reaction monitoring; m/z 583-437 at 42 electron volts (DSB) and m/z 597-437 at 42 electron volts (LH91). Calibration curves were linear over the concentration range 4-500 nm DSB (correlation r = 0.98-0.99). The signals were quantified by integrating the area under the DSB and LH91 peaks from the chromatogram, and DSB signals were normalized against the area obtained for the LH91 internal standard. The ratio of DSB to LH91 was converted to absolute DSB levels based on the volume of sample analyzed by this technique. Radiolabeling of DSB—DSB was labeled with tritium by reduction of the C-20 methylene group using a previously described procedure (18Fujioka T. Kashiwada Y. Kilkuskie R.E. Cosentino L.M. Ballas L.M. Jiang J.B. Janzen W.P. Chen I.S. Lee K.H. J. Nat. Prod. 1994; 57: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Briefly, a mixture of DSB and 5% Pd-C with tritium gas in methanol was stirred overnight at room temperature (performed by Moravek Biochemicals, La Brea, CA). The reaction mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated and purified to 99% purity by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). DSB was dried, weighed, and dissolved at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in ethanol, and the concentration was verified by HPLC with known quantities of dihydro-DSB. The specific radioactivity (∼20 Ci/mmol) was determined by scintillation counting. For procedures involving quantitation of [3H]dihydro-DSB, the quantity of DSB was converted directly from counts/min 3H by counting a known quantity of the stock [3H]dihydro-DSB, thereby eliminating the need to correct for counting efficiency. In Vitro Digestion of Purified Immature HIV-1 Cores—Immature HIV-1 cores were produced by detergent treatment of PR-defective virions and purified by equilibrium sedimentation, as previously described (14Wyma D.J. Kotov A. Aiken C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9381-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cores (800 ng of Gag protein in 40 μl) were incubated in the presence and absence of DSB (2.5 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37°C. Recombinant HIV-1 PR (a generous gift of Dr. David A. Davis, National Cancer Institute, NIH) was added to a final concentration of 1.12 μm in 40 μlof protease digestion buffer (50 mm MES, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.0) and incubated at 37 °C. Samples were removed at various times and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The blots were probed with CA- and MA-specific antibodies, and signals were quantified using the LiCor Odyssey system following probing with an IR dye-conjugated secondary antibody. DSB is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication that acts during particle maturation. We have previously shown that sequencing of the CA-SP1 cleavage site in Gag determines the viral sensitivity to DSB (10Zhou J. Chen C.H. Aiken C. Retrovirology. 2004; 1: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the compound did not inhibit the viral protease in vitro, even using recombinant HIV-1 Gag as the substrate. To reconcile these observations, we hypothesized that DSB specifically associates with the Gag protein during HIV-1 particle assembly. A prediction of this hypothesis is that DSB would be specifically incorporated into HIV-1 particles during their assembly, whereas mutations in Gag that confer resistance to the drug would prevent DSB incorporation. To assay HIV-1 incorporation of DSB, we developed a specific LC/MS-based method to detect the compound. The assay was found to be sensitive and quantitative (Fig. 1, A and B) and was therefore useful for detecting the association of DSB with HIV-1 particles. Because DSB acts during virion maturation, the compound must be present at the time of particle production to be effective. To determine the levels of DSB incorporated into HIV-1 particles, cells were transfected with proviral DNA and cultured in the presence of the compound. Virus particles were harvested and concentrated by pelleting through a sucrose cushion and were further purified by equilibrium density-gradient sedimentation. Fractions containing virus particles were identified by an ELISA specific for the viral core antigen, and the DSB in the particles was extracted and analyzed by LC/MS. We first asked whether viruses containing unprocessed Gag protein would contain significant quantities of DSB. For this purpose, we analyzed immature HIV-1 particles produced from an HIV-1 proviral clone containing PR-inactivating mutations (PR-). Analysis of gradient fractions containing these particles revealed a strong DSB signal (Fig. 1C). As a control, we tested PR-defective particles containing two substitutions at the CA-SP1 junction of Gag that together confer high resistance to DSB (M2.PR-). Relative to immature particles lacking these mutations, the control virions contained only trace quantities of DSB after normalizing for the levels of viral Gag protein. These results demonstrate that DSB is incorporated into immature HIV-1 particles and that mutations conferring resistance to DSB result in reduced levels of DSB in the particles. DSB delays the processing of the CA-SP1 junction but does not completely inhibit cleavage of this site, even when the drug is present at high concentrations (5Zhou J. Yuan X. Dismuke D. Forshey B.M. Lundquist C. Lee K.H. Aiken C. Chen C.H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 922-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10Zhou J. Chen C.H. Aiken C. Retrovirology. 2004; 1: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). By contrast to immature HIV-1 particles, no significant level of DSB was present within purified wild-type virions (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that processing of Gag leads to destruction of the DSB binding site and loss of the compound during purification of the particles. Replication of SIV is fully resistant to DSB (5Zhou J. Yuan X. Dismuke D. Forshey B.M. Lundquist C. Lee K.H. Aiken C. Chen C.H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 922-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and specific amino acid changes in the CA-SP1 cleavage site can render this virus susceptible to the compound (10Zhou J. Chen C.H. Aiken C. Retrovirology. 2004; 1: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The same mutations result in delayed cleavage of this site when SIV particles are produced in the presence of DSB. To further test the link between DSB incorporation and antiviral activity, we generated PR-defective clones of SIVmac239 (SIV.PR-) and an isogenic virus containing mutations conferring DSB sensitivity (SIVm3.PR-). The proviral constructs were transfected into 293T cells, and viruses were produced by culturing transfected cells in the presence of DSB. Analysis of purified virions revealed a strong signal for DSB in the SIVm3.PR- particles, whereas the SIV.PR- particles contained only low levels of the compound (Fig. 1D). These results further demonstrate that the association of DSB with HIV-1 particles is linked to its antiviral activity. The LC/MS assay was highly specific for DSB, but the assay was not sufficiently quantitative for us to reliably determine the stoichiometry of DSB incorporation into immature HIV-1 particles. For this purpose, we produced 3H-labeled DSB by reductive tritiation of the methylene group at the 29 position. Previous studies have demonstrated that reduction of this site has minimal effects on DSB antiviral potency (9Hashimoto F. Kashiwada Y. Cosentino L.M. Chen C.H. Garrett P.E. Lee K.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To quantify incorporation of DSB into PR-defective HIV-1, we produced the virus in the presence of various concentrations of [3H]dihydro-DSB, purified the virions, and quantified the radioactivity (by liquid scintillation counting) and viral core antigen (by ELISA). Incorporation of the drug was nearly saturated at a concentration of 2 μg/ml (Fig. 2A). Quantitation of virus-associated DSB and Gag protein revealed that the levels corresponded to a stoichiometry of DSB:Gag of ∼1. We conclude that DSB is stoichiometrically associated with Gag in immature HIV-1 particles. To further evaluate the specificity of DSB incorporation, we tested the ability of unlabeled DSB, or the poorly active parent compound betulinic acid (BA), to inhibit incorporation of [3H]dihydro-DSB during assembly of HIV-1 particles. For this purpose, we produced immature HIV-1 particles in the presence of a subsaturating concentration (0.5 μg/ml) of [3H]dihydro-DSB together with increasing doses of DSB or BA. Particles were then harvested, purified to remove unincorporated drug, and assayed for the levels of associated [3H]dihydro-DSB. Unlabeled DSB (but not unlabeled BA) inhibited incorporation of [3H]dihydro-DSB in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). These data provide additional evidence for the specific and saturable incorporation of DSB during the assembly of HIV-1 particles. Previous studies have established that expression of Gag is sufficient for formation of immature virus-like particles (19Gheysen D. Jacobs E. de Foresta F. Thiriart C. Francotte M. Thines D. De Wilde M. Cell. 1989; 59: 103-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). To further probe the requirements for DSB incorporation into HIV-1 particles, we quantified the incorporation of [3H]dihydro-DSB into particles generated by the expression of a codon-optimized Gag expression construct. This approach allows the production of HIV-1 particles without the requirement for expression of other viral proteins. DSB was associated with the Gag virus-like particles, and mutations at the CA-SP1 junction that confer strong resistance to DSB also markedly inhibited association (Fig. 3). We conclude that Gag is sufficient for the specific association of DSB with immature HIV-1 particles. The lack of activity of DSB with recombinant Gag or peptide substrates of HIV-1 PR suggests that DSB associates a binding site formed by the assembly of Gag into particles. This putative binding site might only be accessible during an intermediate stage of HIV-1 particle assembly or could also exist in the intact immature particle. We therefore asked whether DSB is capable of associating with preformed immature HIV-1 particles. Immature virions were produced by transfection of 293T cells with HIV-1.PR- or HIVm2.PR- proviral DNAs. DSB (0.5 μg/ml) was added to a sample of each virus and incubated for 2 h. The particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation to remove free DSB, resuspended in a small volume of buffer, and purified by equilibrium density sedimentation (Fig. 4). DSB was present at high levels in immature HIV-1 particles but not when amino acids conferring resistance to the drug were present in Gag. We conclude that DSB is capable of specific association with immature HIV-1 particles following their release from cells. A barrier to understanding the mechanism of DSB antiviral action has been the lack of detectable activity of the drug in vitro. The ability of DSB to specifically associate with preformed immature HIV-1 particles suggests an experimental approach to detect DSB activity in a cell-free system. Specifically, we hypothesized that the addition of DSB to assembled immature HIV-1 cores would inhibit cleavage of the CA-SP1 junction in Gag in vitro by exogenously added HIV-1 PR. To test this, viral cores were purified from immature HIV-1 particles by Triton X-100 treatment of virions followed by equilibrium sedimentation to remove the detergent. Our laboratory has previously used this approach to demonstrate the stable association of the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins with immature HIV-1 cores (14Wyma D.J. Kotov A. Aiken C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9381-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Following purification of the immature cores, DSB was added and incubated for 2 h to allow association with the cores, followed by the addition of purified recombinant HIV-1 PR and withdrawal of samples at various times for analysis. Cleavage of Gag was subsequently monitored by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using a CA-specific antibody. When added to the purified immature HIV-1 cores (HIV-1.PR-), DSB was observed to delay the processing of the CA-SP1 junction in Gag (Fig. 5A). By contrast, the drug had no detectable effect on the cleavage of Gag in the HIVm2.PR- cores (Fig. 5B). In previous studies, we showed that processing of the CA-SP1 junction occurred more slowly in HIVm2 virions than in wild-type HIV-1 particles (10Zhou J. Chen C.H. Aiken C. Retrovirology. 2004; 1: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a difference that was also apparent in these in vitro assays (Fig. 5; compare PR- and HIVm2.PR- samples without DSB). However, we observed similar rates of processing of the MA-CA junction in the two core samples (data not shown), thereby excluding a global effect of the mutations on core structure or protease sensitivity. A slight accumulation of a Gag processing intermediate, likely corresponding to an MA-CA Gag processing intermediate, was observed for both viruses in the presence of DSB. This effect was not linked to the antiviral activity of the drug and is therefore an apparently nonspecific effect of the drug. Collectively, these results suggest that DSB associates with its functional target when added to immature HIV-1 cores in vitro, thus inhibiting PR-mediated cleavage of the CA-SP1 junction. To determine whether the inhibition of Gag cleavage by DSB could be correlated with the incorporation of the compound into viral particles, we analyzed the cleavage of immature HIV-1 cores by recombinant PR in the presence of various concentrations of DSB. In these reactions, samples were removed at 1, 2, 4, and 8 h of incubation, and the cleavage of the CA-SP1 junction was then monitored by immunoblotting using a CA-specific antibody (Fig. 6A). The results revealed a dose-dependent inhibition of CA-SP1 cleavage by DSB. The magnitude of the effect of DSB was dependent on the incubation time, likely reflecting the observation that DSB delays (but does not fully inhibit) cleavage of CA-SP1 during HIV-1 maturation (5Zhou J. Yuan X. Dismuke D. Forshey B.M. Lundquist C. Lee K.H. Aiken C. Chen C.H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 922-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis of the immunoblot demonstrated that, in the 2-h incubation time, the drug had inhibited processing of CA-SP1 by ∼50% at a concentration of 0.31 μg/ml (Fig. 6B). This is a concentration at which DSB was incorporated at a level that was approximately half-maximal (Fig. 2A) and is similar to the IC50 of the drug in transfected 293T cells (10Zhou J. Chen C.H. Aiken C. Retrovirology. 2004; 1: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, the potency of DSB inhibition of CA-SP1 cleavage in immature HIV-1 cores in vitro correlated well with the level of DSB incorporation into HIV-1 particles and its antiviral potency. In this study, we provide compelling evidence that the mechanism of DSB antiviral activity involves association of the molecule with HIV-1 particles as they are formed. We showed that DSB specifically associates with immature HIV-1 virions when the drug is present during or following completion of particle formation. The maximum level of DSB in the particles corresponded to a stoichiometry of 1 molecule/molecule of Gag. The viral protease was not required for incorporation of DSB, as pseudovirions containing only the viral Gag proteins also incorporated DSB. Thus, DSB likely associates with Gag during and/or after particle assembly. Mutations in Gag that render HIV-1 resistant to DSB prevented association of the compound with the particles, thus linking the antiviral activity of DSB to HIV-1 particle association. Collectively, these results indicate that DSB associates with a specific binding site formed by the viral Gag protein within the virion. The putative binding pocket involves amino acids located at the CA-SP1 cleavage site, as substitutions in this region result in HIV-1 resistance to DSB resistance and reduced drug association with the mutant virions. Small molecule HIV-1 antivirals currently in clinical use target viral enzymes, including reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease. The majority of these drugs act as competitive inhibitors of the viral enzyme, or in the case of nucleoside-based reverse transcriptase inhibitors, as substrates that interfere with chain elongation during reverse transcription. Our data indicate that DSB acts by binding to the viral Gag protein (a substrate of the viral protease) and interfering with its ability to serve as a substrate. It is also formally possible that DSB associates with Gag via a bridging molecule, although this seems less likely, as mutations in Gag confer strong resistance to the drug, yet do not affect HIV-1 particle formation (10Zhou J. Chen C.H. Aiken C. Retrovirology. 2004; 1: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the DSB antiviral mechanism is unprecedented; together with studies of other viruses (20Grant R.A. Hiremath C.N. Filman D.J. Syed R. Andries K. Hogle J.M. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 784-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Smith T.J. Kremer M.J. Luo M. Vriend G. Arnold E. Kamer G. Rossmann M.G. McKinlay M.A. Diana G.D. Otto M.J. Science. 1986; 233: 1286-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), this underscores the fact that small molecules need not target viral enzymes to be potent replication inhibitors. Our results also demonstrated that DSB inhibits cleavage of the CA-SP1 junction in Gag in vitro when added to viral cores purified from immature HIV-1 particles. The potency of DSB in this assay was in good agreement with the dose response of the compound in virion association assays, further supporting a mechanism involving drug association with immature particles. Previous studies have failed to detect an effect of DSB on the viral protease in vitro; however, these studies employed synthetic peptides or recombinant Gag proteins as substrates to test for DSB-dependent inhibition of protease activity (6Li F. Goila-Gaur R. Salzwedel K. Kilgore N.R. Reddick M. Matallana C. Castillo A. Zoumplis D. Martin D.E. Orenstein J.M. Allaway G.P. Freed E.O. Wild C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). 4J. Zhou, X. Yuan, C. H. Chen, and C. Aiken, unpublished observations. Our findings that DSB was incorporated at a 1:1 stoichiometry with Gag and was active toward protease cleavage of immature HIV-1 cores in vitro must be reconciled with the apparent absence of DSB activity toward soluble recombinant Gag protein in vitro. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that DSB itself may not be the active form of the compound but may first have to be modified by cellular enzymes to become active. Our data argue against this hypothesis, because DSB was active in vitro and was incorporated without any change in mass into viral particles. A second possibility is that the recombinant Gag proteins previously employed for in vitro cleavage assays lacked a specific modification that occurs when the protein is expressed in mammalian cells and that this modification is essential for DSB binding. A third explanation for the failure to detect DSB activity against soluble Gag protein is that the activity may be detectable only when the cleavage assay is performed under highly specific reaction conditions. Although the latter two possibilities have not been completely excluded, we favor the alternative hypothesis that DSB associates with a binding site that is formed only upon the assembly of Gag into its oligomeric form present within particles. Future studies of DSB activity against Gag protein assembled in vitro will test this hypothesis. Recent structural studies indicate that the Gag protein forms a hexameric lattice within the immature HIV-1 particle (22Briggs J.A. Simon M.N. Gross I. Krausslich H.G. Fuller S.D. Vogt V.M. Johnson M.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 672-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). We imagine three possibilities for association of DSB with Gag in the particle. First, one molecule of DSB may bind each molecule of Gag when the protein is present in a specific conformation that is unique to the assembled particle. Second, DSB may associate with an interface between each pair of Gag molecules within the hexamer. Both of these hypotheses are consistent with the observed 1:1 stoichiometry of DSB association with Gag in immature HIV-1 particles. Nonetheless, we favor a third model in which DSB forms a trimer that is stabilized by intermolecular interactions of the hydrophobic betulinic acid core (Fig. 7). In this scenario, the CA-SP1 junction, representing the target of DSB, is also present as a trimer at each 3-fold axis of symmetry in the hexameric Gag lattice. This model is attractive in its ability to reconcile a variety of observations regarding DSB. First, DSB targets a specific site in Gag. Second, DSB does not inhibit cleavage of recombinant soluble Gag by PR in vitro, making it unlikely that DSB binds a monomer of the viral protein. The compound is therefore likely to recognize a Gag-Gag interface. Third, DSB is incorporated into immature particles at a 1:1 stoichiometry with Gag. Fourth, Gag forms a hexameric lattice in immature HIV-1 particles; nevertheless, emerging evidence indicates that a myristoylated MA-CA fragment trimerizes in solution (23Tang C. Loeliger E. Luncsford P. Kinde I. Beckett D. Summers M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and that Gag can form trimers in solution upon the addition of specific phospholipids. 5S. Datta, J. Lebowitz, and A. Rein, personal communication. The hexameric lattice of Gag also contains 3-fold axes of symmetry, further underscoring the possibility of trimeric regions of the polyprotein. Finally, the betulinic acid molecular scaffold on which DSB is built also serves as the core for other derivatives that specifically block HIV-1 entry (24Aiken C. Chen C.H. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 31-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). An enigma surrounding betulinic acid-based HIV-1 antivirals is how nearly identical molecules can specifically and potently block such seemingly unrelated steps in the virus life cycle as entry and maturation. Because the viral envelope protein that is the target of the betulinic acid-derived entry inhibitors is a homotrimeric protein, it is possible that binding of the compounds as trimers with their targets is a common feature of HIV-1 maturation inhibitors and BA-derived entry inhibitors. The model implies that DSB association with immature particles is cooperative; however, the hyperbolic binding of DSB is apparently inconsistent with this hypothesis. Nonetheless, it remains possible that DSB forms trimers in solution that associate non-cooperatively with the Gag polymer. The model may not prove to be accurate in all its aspects, but it makes specific predictions that can be tested in the future using structural and biophysical approaches. DSB is the prototype of a new class of HIV-1 antivirals known as maturation inhibitors. The potency and selectivity of DSB, combined with its novel mechanism of action, make it attractive for therapeutic development, and the compound is currently in clinical trials as an HIV-1 therapy. Our results further clarify the target and mechanism of action of this interesting molecule and establish new assays that may be used in evaluating other compounds that may act by a related mechanism.

Despite the typically weak interaction of lectin domains with their carbohydrate ligands, they usually achieve high avidity through oligomeric structures or by the presence of tandem carbohydrate-binding domains along the polypeptide. The recently described structure of the fucose-binding European eel agglutinin revealed a novel lectin fold (the “F-type” fold), which is shared with other carbohydrate-binding proteins and apparently unrelated proteins from prokaryotes to vertebrates, and a unique fucose-binding sequence motif. Here we described the biochemical and molecular characterization of a unique fucose-binding lectin (MsaFBP32) isolated from serum of the striped bass (Morone saxatilis), composed of two tandem domains that exhibit the eel carbohydrate recognition sequence motif, which we designate F-type. We also described a novel lectin family (“F-type”) constituted by a large number of proteins exhibiting greater multiples of the F-type motif, either tandemly arrayed or in mosaic combinations with other domains, including a putative transmembrane receptor, that suggests an extensive functional diversification of this lectin family. Among the tandem lectins, MsaFBP32 and other tandem binary homologues appear unique in that although their N-terminal domain shows close similarity to the fucose recognition domain of the eel agglutinin, their C-terminal domain exhibits changes that potentially could confer a distinct specificity for fucosylated ligands. In contrast with the amniotes, in which the F-type lectins appear conspicuously absent, the widespread gene duplication in the teleost fish suggests these F-type lectins acquired increasing evolutionary value within this taxon.

Although lectin-ligand interactions are relatively weak as compared with other immune recognition molecules, high avidity for the target is achieved by the association of peptide subunits into oligomeric structures in which multiple CRDs interact with ligand simultaneously (5Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). In soluble collectins (2Holmskov U. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 547-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) such as the mannose-binding lectin, the subunits possessing a single CRD associate to form a “bouquet”-like oligomer with all CRDs facing a potential target surface. However, in the “cruciform” organization of the conglutinin subunits, the single CRDs are arranged in a manner that can also cross-link multiple targets. A less frequent organizational plan is the presence of tandem CRDs encoded within a polypeptide, such as observed in the macrophage mannose receptor (6Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D.

The recently described F-type lectin fold from the European eel agglutinin (AAA) (12Bianchet M.A. Odom E.W. Vasta G.R. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 628-634PubMed Google Scholar) is widely distributed in proteins from horseshoe crabs to amphibians, with some representatives proposed to play a role in immunity (13Honda S.

Although AAA and the rat mannose-binding lectin, a C-type lectin, specifically recognize terminal l-fucose (l-Fuc), they do so through differing binding interactions (15Ng K.K. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which illustrate convergent functional properties among unrelated lectin families. Most surprisingly, the F-type fold is also shared with several proteins of distinct functional properties, including the C-terminal domain of human blood coagulation factors V (16Macedo-Ribeiro S.

The structural analogy of these seemingly unrelated proteins is indicative of the archaic origin of this lectin fold. Although preliminary searches in the sequence data bases suggest that AAA-like proteins possessing multiple CRDs are phylogenetically widespread, so far none have been characterized biochemically or structurally.Here we describe the biochemical and molecular characterization of a unique l-Fuc-binding lectin isolated from the serum of the striped bass (Morone saxatilis) that not only shares the CRD sequence motif of AAA but possesses two similar yet distinct CRDs in the polypeptide subunit. In contrast with the N-terminal CRD, which presents the highest similarity to the AAA CRD, the C-CRD presents unique features. This study represents the first characterization of a lectin with tandemly arrayed domains exhibiting the AAA CRD sequence motif, which we propose be named F-type CRD. We also describe a large number of proteins exhibiting this sequence motif, which we propose be designated as the F-type lectin family. Novel domain combinations present in some family representatives suggest extensive functional diversification of the F-type CRD.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsCarbohydrates (monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and glycoproteins, at the highest purity available), divinyl sulfone, Sepharose-6B, fish gelatin, and DNA primers were purchased from Sigma. Protein electrophoresis reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Red blood cells were obtained from the University of Maryland Hospital blood bank or from a commercial source (Immucor, Norcross, GA). EnzyOne 2000 DNA polymerase and dNTPs were purchased from Enzypol and ID Labs (London, Ontario, Canada), respectively. ExTaq DNA polymerase was purchased from PanVera (Madison, WI).AnimalsStriped bass (Morone saxatilis (Walbaum, 1792)) of ∼2 kg were held in 1.8- and 3.6-m circular tanks within a recirculating water system. Stocking densities did not exceed 38 kg/m3. Water salinity was 10 parts/thousand held at 15 °C under a seasonal photoperiod at the Aquaculture Research Center, Center of Marine Biotechnology, Baltimore, MD. Before venipuncture or challenge injections, all animals were anesthetized in 250 ppm 2-phenoxyethanol (J. T. Baker Inc.).Purification of MsaFBP32Initial purification was performed from bass liver (200 g). The fresh tissue was minced on a pan chilled on ice and liquefied with 200 ml of chilled Extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm lactose, 25 mm KCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.8, 4 °C) in a chilled Waring blender for 1 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was sieved through cheesecloth and stored on wet ice. A second extraction of the pellet with 200 ml of chilled extraction buffer was performed twice and pooled with the first supernatant. To allow lipids to separate, the homogenate was kept on wet ice for 1 h after which floating coalesced lipid droplets were removed with a pipette. The homogenate was clarified by a second centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. All further lectin purification was carried out from serum as follows: peripheral blood (∼10 ml/kg) was collected from the caudal vein using an 18-gauge hypodermic needle, and the clot was allowed to retract overnight at 4 °C. Serum was separated from the clot by centrifugation. Serum samples from usually four specimens were pooled (40 ml) and dialyzed against 1000 volumes of TBS-Ca (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, 4 °C) with four changes in 24 h. The dialyzed serum was diluted 1:1 in TBS-Ca and passed over a divinyl sulfone-conjugated l-fucose-Sepharose-6B column (1.6 × 2 cm) (24Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Smith P.K. Immobilized Affinity Ligand Techniques. Academic Press, San Diego1992: 164Google Scholar) at 0.4 ml/h and monitored at 280 nm with an UviCord II detector (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed to base line with TBS-Ca followed by elution with TBS, 30 mm EDTA, washed to base line again, and finally eluted with 200 mm l-fucose in TBS-Ca. Fractions (0.5 ml) containing protein peaks were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration in a Centricon 10 (Millipore: Billerica, MA) to a final concentration of ∼10 mg/ml. All affinity chromatography steps were performed at 4 °C. The affinity eluate was subjected to size exclusion chromatography (SEC) at room temperature on a Superose 12 10/30 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with TBS-Ca, connected to a Beckman Gold 126/166 HPLC, at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and the elution monitored at 280 nm. The purified lectin was stored at 4 °C.Analytical ProceduresProtein Determination—Estimates of protein concentration were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit I, using crystalline bovine serum albumin as standard. The microassay format in 96-well flat bottom plates was employed as described by the manufacturer. After 5 min of combining protein and dye, the reactions were read at 595 nm on SpectraMax340 Plate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) controlled by SoftmaxPro software version 1.Electrophoresis and Isoelectric Focusing Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed on Laemmli mini-gels using a Hoefer SE250 apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) cooled to 15 °C. Denaturing slab isoelectric focusing and measurement of the pH gradient was performed as described previously (25Ploegh H.L. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, New York2000: 10.2.1-10.2.8Google Scholar) using a Hoefer SE600 apparatus. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturer using the Hoefer mini-gel system, using the same ampholyte mix as before (one-dimensional), and treating the tube gel with reducing agent prior to resolving on a 12.5% T SDS-PAGE slab (two-dimensional).Electron Spray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS)—The mass of MsaFBP32 was analyzed by ESI-MS at the Microchemical and Proteomics Facility at Emory University. The procedure used is as follows. One nanomole of MsaFBP32 was desalted by binding to a C-18 ZipTip (Millipore) and eluted with 2 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Isopropyl alcohol/water (50:50; 5 μl) was added to the eluate, and 5 μl were used for flow injection analysis on a PE-SCIEX API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems: Foster City, CA). A Q1 scan was performed with a scan range of 400–2000 m/z, step size of 0.2 atomic mass units, and a dwell time of 0.8 ms.Assessment of Protein Glycosylation—The presence of covalently bound carbohydrates on MsaFBP32 was assessed using the digoxigenin glycan detection kit (Roche Applied Science), and 1 μg of protein was blotted onto Millipore Immobilon membrane.Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography—The molecular weight of the native MsaFBP32 was estimated by SEC using calibration markers of known size as follows: bovine serum albumin (35.5 Å, 67 kDa), ovalbumin (30.5 Å, 43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (20.9 Å, 25 kDa), and RNase A (16.4 Å, 13.7 kDa) (Amersham Biosciences). Two sets of calibration protein mixes were prepared in water at empirically determined concentrations to yield peaks of similar height. Set I consisted of bovine serum albumin (7 mg/ml) and chymotrypsinogen A (3 mg/ml). Set II consisted of ovalbumin (7 mg/ml) and RNase A (10 mg/ml). Injecting 200 μl of each set separately allowed total peak resolution for each of the marker proteins on the Superose 12 column. The column void volume (V0) and total liquid column volume (Vt) was determined with 200 μlof dextran blue 2000 (2 mg/ml) and 5 mg/ml acetone, respectively. The distribution coefficient (KD) was calculated for each marker (KD = (Vr - V0)/(Vt - V0), where Vr is the elution volume of a specific peak), and a plot of KD versus log10 Mr was fitted by a 3rd order polynomial curve (DeltaGraph version 4.1, SPSS Inc., Chicago) to allow the interpolation of molecular weight of the experimental sample.Chemical Cross-linking—MsaFBP32 was first dialyzed against 2 liters of 100 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2. The concentration of working solution was adjusted to 35 μm (1.13 g/liter based on molecular mass of 32,388 Da), and 5-μl aliquots were combined with 5 μl (0, 35, 70, 140, 350, 700, and 1,400 μm) bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) to achieve up to a 20 m excess. The reactions were incubated for 60 min at room temperature and finally diluted 1:1 with double-strength SDS-PAGE (dithiothreitol) sample buffer, heated to 100 °C for 5 min, and the full reaction (20 μl) loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide mini-format gel.Characterization of the Carbohydrate SpecificityAgglutination Assays—Microhemagglutination tests were carried out in bovine serum albumin-blocked, 96-well Terasaki plates (Robbins Scientific: Mountain View, CA) as reported earlier (26Vasta G.R. Marchalonis J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9182-9186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μlofa 5 × 106 cells/ml suspension of Pronase (Calbiochem-Novabiochem)-treated human type A erythrocytes in TBS-Ca was added to equal volumes of 2-fold dilutions of lectin (MsaFBP32) in TBS-Ca. The plates were gently vortex-mixed for 10 s and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Agglutination was read under a microscope, and scored from 0 (negative) to +4. The reciprocal of the highest dilution of lectin showing an agglutination score of +1/2 was recorded as the titer. The lectin specific activity is defined as titer/mg of protein/ml. Controls were carried out by adding TBS-Ca instead of lectin.Agglutination-Inhibition Assays—Carbohydrate binding specificity was determined with the use of the microhemagglutination assay described above. A lectin solution with a titer of 2 agglutination units was prepared in TBS-Ca. All carbohydrates to be tested as inhibitors were dissolved in TBS at concentrations up to 200 mm for mono- and oligosaccharides and 10 mg/ml for polysaccharides and glycoproteins and brought to pH 7.6 with concentrated NaOH. Serial 2-fold dilutions were made of the inhibitors in the same buffer. Inhibition by mono- and oligosaccharides was tested at concentrations from 0.1 to 200 mm. Inhibition by glycoproteins, asialoglycoproteins, and polysaccharides was tested at concentrations up to 10 mg/ml. A volume of 5 μl of ligand dilution was added to 5 μl of lectin in 96-well Terasaki plates. The mixtures were incubated for 45 min, and 2 μl of the erythrocyte suspension (107 cells/ml) was added to each well. Controls were the substitutions of the inhibitor solution by TBS and substitution of purified lectin by TBS-Ca. Fifty % inhibition values were interpolated from curve fits (DeltaGraph version 4.1) of plots of percent inhibition versus inhibitor concentration.Cation Requirements—To test cation requirements for lectin binding, MsaFBP32 (200 μl) was dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of 100 mm citrate (pH 6), 10 mm EDTA using three buffer changes. The sample was then dialyzed against TBS to restore neutral pH. A control sample was dialyzed against TBS-Ca in parallel with the experimental sample. To test if calcium concentration had an effect on hemagglutination activity, 5-μl samples of MsaFBP32 serially diluted in TBS were incubated with 5 μl of 200, 20, 2, 0.2 and 0.02 CaCl2 or 200 mm EDTA, pH 8, in Terasaki plates. After 30 min of equilibration, 2 μl of a Pronase-treated human A red blood cell suspension (107 cells/ml) was added to the wells and vortex-mixed gently for 10 s. Agglutination was read as described above.Preparation of Rabbit Anti-MsaFBP32 Antiserum—An anti-MsaFBP32 antiserum was prepared from New Zealand White rabbits by Duncroft (Lovetsville, VA) with an intramuscular injection of 100 μg of affinity-purified MsaFBP32 in Freund's complete adjuvant, followed by two boost intradermal injections (50 μg of MsaFBP32 in Freund's incomplete adjuvant) administered at days 14 and 28. Antibody titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay following conventional methods (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The specificity of the antiserum was assessed by Western blot. For this purpose, the affinity-purified MsaFBP32 or serum were electrotransfered onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked with PBS-T (0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), 3% (v/v) fish gelatin for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with anti-MsaFBP32 (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h. After three washes with PBS-T, membranes were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:2000 dilution) (Bio-Rad) in PBS-T, 3% gelatin for 1 h, washed three times with PBS-T, and developed with chloronaphthol (Bio-Rad).Primary Structure Analyses—N-terminal and internal peptide sequences of MsaFBP32 were determined chemically at the Microchemical and Proteomics Facility, Emory University, Atlanta, GA. MsaFBP32 was cleaved with trypsin and lysyl endopeptidase (E/S = 1:50, w/w, at 30 °C, 10–20 h) in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 1 m guanidine hydrochloride, pH 8.5. The digests were acidified to pH ∼2 using 10% trifluoroacetic acid and fractionated on a microbore reverse phase-HPLC system consisting of Applied Biosystems model 140A pumps and model 1000S diode-array detector (2.3-ml flow cell, 0.0025-inch inner diameter tubing). Peptides were purified on either a Zorbax-SB C-18 silica column (0.1 × 15 cm, dp ∼5 mm, 300-Å pore size; Microtech Scientific, Saratoga, CA) or an Aquapore ODS-300 C-18 silica column (0.1 × 25 cm, dp ∼7 mm, 300-Å pore size; Applied Biosystems) equilibrated at room temperature in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted at flow rates of 50–80 μl/min using linear gradients of acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (80:20:0.1, v/v). The column effluent was monitored at 215 nm, and the UV absorption spectra of the absorbing material were determined, and the eluate was manually collected and stored at -20 °C prior to further analysis. Rechromatography of some fractions in the second reverse phase-HPLC elution solvent system consisting of 2-propanol/acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (70:20:10:0.1, v/v) was required prior to sequencing. Automated Edman degradation of the intact protein and selected peptides (28Hewick R.M. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Dreyer W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7990-7997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was performed on an Applied Biosystems model pulsed-liquid 477A/120A sequencing system. The phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were separated and identified as described previously (29Pohl J. Dunn B.M. Pennington M.W. Peptide Analysis Protocols. 36. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1994: 107-129Google Scholar).cDNA Cloning and Sequence Analysis—Reverse transcription from 5 μg of liver total RNA was performed using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT17), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Degenerate primers, with 5′ adapter extension ends, were designed based on the N-terminal and internal peptide amino acid sequence of MsaFBP32 accounting for codon frequencies of M. saxatilis. The resulting primers, FntermD (5′-dCAAAGCTTTAYAACTAYAARAACGTNGC-3′), Rv3083D (5′-dTCGAATTCGTNACGATRTANGGCTC-3′), and Rv437bD (5′-dTCGAATTCACCTCNACCTCRCA-3′), were used for PCR amplification according to protocol described previously (30Compton T. Innis M.A. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 39-45Google Scholar) using an MJ Research DNA Engine PTC-200 (Waltham, MA). Amplified fragments were agarose gel-purified and cloned into the pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) for sequencing. The cDNA sequence was completed using the Marathon RACE kit (Clontech) with internal gene-specific primers 3083anti (5′-dGATGGAGGTGACGATGTAGGGCTC-3′) for the 5′-RACE and 3083sense (5′-dAGCCCTACATCGTCACCTCCATC-3′) for the 3′-RACE. Clones were sequenced from both directions using dye termination reactions and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems model 373 stretch sequencer. Contig assembly was performed with Sequencer version 3.1 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). Calculations of theoretical molecular weight and pI from the deduced amino acid sequence were performed with Prot-Param (www.expasy.ch).Homology Modeling—The putative tertiary structure of each CRD from MsaFBP32 was modeled using the crystallographic structure of AAA as template. The polypeptide sequence of each CRD was aligned to the AAA template structure (Protein Data Bank accession code 1K12) using DeepView 3.5 and the model optimized by the SwissModel server using default settings (31Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9467) Google Scholar). The models were rendered using Win-MegaPOV version 0.7 (megapov.inetart.net/).Gene Organization—An M. saxatilis genomic DNA bacteriophage library produced in λFixII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened by conventional plaque lift hybridization (32Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) on Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a 480-bp MsaFBP32 cDNA probe produced by PCR amplification with primers FBP469.F (5′-dGTTACGTGACTGTGCTTCTACCTGG-3′) and FBP949.R (5′-dACAGGGTCAGGTACTCTTCTCTTCC-3′). The amplified DNA was purified and labeled to high specific activity by random prime labeling using RediPrime II and Redivue [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed in 0.5 m NaHPO4 pH 7.2, 7% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C in a circulating air oven overnight. Membranes were washed twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C for 15 min prior to autoradiography. After three rounds of purifying hybridizations, DNA from positive plaques was prepared using the Midi λ DNA purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Unique clones were identified by restriction mapping and further analyzed by subcloning and DNA sequencing. The complete cDNA sequence of MsaFBP32II was obtained with GeneRacer (Invitrogen) using the following gene-specific primers: MsFBP6.F (5′-dAGCCAAATCGTTCAATCTGCC-3′) for 3′-RACE and MsfbpIIB.R (5′-dTGAGCACATATGCGGTATTGTCTG-3′) and MsfbpIIA.R (5′-dCACACGTGATTGTTGCACCTGAGAC-3′) for 5′ RACE, using liver cDNA as template.Northern Analysis—Ten μg of organ-extracted total RNA or 1 μg of liver poly(A)+ RNA was resolved by electrophoresis on a 1% (w/v) agarose-formaldehyde gel. RNA was then transferred onto Zeta Probe GT membrane (Bio-Rad) in alkaline solution (3 m NaCl, 10 mm NaOH) after which the membrane was washed in 2× SSC (30 mm sodium citrate, pH 7, 0.3 m NaCl). A cDNA probe was generated with RediPrime II (Amersham Biosciences) using as template an 800-bp PCR amplicon (FNTERMD, 5′-dCAAAGCTTTAYAACTAYAARAACGTNGC-3′; Rv437BD, 5′-dTCGAATTCACCTCNACCTCRCA-3′) of the cloned MsaFBP32 cDNA. The resulting probe was hybridized overnight to the membrane (106 cpm/ml) in 250 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 7% SDS at 65 °C after which the membrane was washed in 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and imaged by autoradiography.RT-PCR—MsaFBP32 cDNA was PCR-amplif"
https://openalex.org/W2023800438,"Following genotoxic stress, p53 either rescues a damaged cell or promotes its elimination. The parameters determining a specific outcome of the p53 response are largely unknown. In mouse fibroblasts treated with different irradiation schemes, we monitored transcriptional and non-transcriptional p53 activities and identified determinants that initiate an anti- or a pro-apoptotic p53 response within the context of p53-independent stress signaling. The primary, transcription-mediated p53 response in these cells is anti-apoptotic, while induction of p53-dependent apoptosis requires an additional, transcription-independent p53 activity, provided by high intracellular levels of activated p53. High intracellular levels of p53 were selectively generated after apoptosis-inducing high-dose UV-irradiation, and correlated with a strongly delayed upregulation of Mdm2. Following high-dose UV-irradiation, p53 accumulated in the cytoplasm and led to activation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. As p53-dependent Bax-activation is transcription-independent, we postulated that certain transcription-deficient mutant p53 proteins might also exert this activity. Indeed we found an endogenous, transcription-inactive mutant p53 that upon genotoxic stress induced Bax-activation in vivo. Our results demonstrate the impact and in vivo relevance of non-transcriptional mechanisms for wild-type and mutant p53-mediated apoptosis."

We also demonstrate that the strong transcriptional suppression of such neuron-specific genes as synaptophysin and SCG10 by NRSF in these non-neural cells requires the functional SWI/SNF complex; these neuronal genes were elevated in cell lines deficient in both Brm and BRG1, whereas retrovirus vectors expressing siRNAs targeting integral components of SWI/SNF complex (Brm/BRG1 or Ini1) induced expression of these neuronal genes in SWI/SNF-competent cell lines. In cell lines deficient in both Brm and BRG1, exogenous Brm or BRG1 suppressed expression of these neuronal genes in an ATP-dependent manner and induced efficient and specific deacetylation of histone H4 around the NRSF binding site present in the synaptophysin gene by a large complex containing the recruited functional SWI/SNF complex. Patients with Brm/BRG1-deficient lung carcinoma have been reported to carry poor prognosis; derepression of NRSF-regulated genes including these neuron-specific genes could contribute to enhance tumorigenicity and also would provide selective markers for Brm/BRG1-deficient tumors."

How can biomineral nanocrystallites be assembled to form a synergetic structure? Why are some molecules, in particular biomacromolecules, capable of fabricating different patterns of biominerals?

It is well documented that the ordered structures in mineralized tissues appeared to originate from organized assemblies of biomacromolecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides, or proteoglycans, and inorganic compound salts (8Bauerein E.

Previous studies indicate that some biomacromolecules are involved in controlling the nucleation, growth, size, and shape of the mineral phases (11Greenfield G. Wilson D.C. Crenshaw M.A. Am. Zool. 1984; 24: 925-932Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar), since they can act as templates through self-assembly to facilitate interaction with an insoluble matrix and to induce the desired stereochemistry for the construction of organized structures (12Mann S.

Normally, these molecules are functionalized with acidic groups such as carboxylic acid, sulfonate, and phosphate moieties, which enable them to become an effective metal ion chelator to combine with the inorganic matrix (14Veis A.

Chondroitin 4-sulfate (ChS) is just one of these biomolecules. It belongs to the family of glycosaminoglycans, which can be found on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix of cartilage and bone. Large amounts of it in the cartilage permit diffusion of substances between blood and vessels. ChS consists of repeated disaccharide units; one of the two monosaccharides is N-acetylgalactosamine sulfate (GalNAc-OSO3-), and the other is glucuronic acid that contains a carboxylate group (cf. Fig. 1). Previous investigation indicated that ChS is present at the early stages of bone and tooth formation and is considered to be implicated in regulating mineral deposition and crystal morphology in mineralization during osteogenesis (6Kjellen L.

In addition, ChS may promote healing of bones (20Moss M. Kruger G.O. Reynolds D.C. Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol. 1965; 20: 795-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of biomolecule-mediated mineralization, in particular the detailed nucleation kinetic processes and the molecular recognition mechanism at the interface between biomolecule and biomineral, are poorly understood. In this paper, we present a study on the templating effect of ChS on the nucleation of HAP using a light-scattering technique. A generic kinetic model on nucleation (21Liu X.Y. Sato K. Nakajima K. Furukawa Y. Advances in Crystal Growth Research. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam2001: 42-61Crossref Google Scholar) is applied to analyze quantitatively the effect of ChS on HAP crystallization. In the presence of ChS, we synthesized self-aligned HAP nanocrystallites from supersaturated solutions, and here we discuss the nucleation mechanism. We hope this study will not only provide a new and comprehensive understanding of the nucleation mechanism of self-assembled HAP biominerals but also a basic design principle for the development of biocompatible human-made materials. Nucleation Kinetics Experiments—The nucleation kinetics experiments of HAP were performed on a dynamic light-scattering system (BI-200SM; Brookhaven Instruments Corp.), which can detect particles of a size down to several nanometers and allow an in situ measurement of the nucleation process (21Liu X.Y. Sato K. Nakajima K. Furukawa Y. Advances in Crystal Growth Research. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam2001: 42-61Crossref Google Scholar). First, two aqueous solutions of CaCl2·2H2O and K2HPO4·3H2O with a molar ratio of 1.67 of calcium/phosphorus were prepared. After determining the range of concentrations in which the nucleation induction time could be detected, a series of concentrations of these two solutions (varying from 2.3 to 3.0 mm for CaCl2) was prepared by diluting the original solutions. Then both kinds of solutions with 10 mg/liter ChS (Sigma) were injected through filters (200 nm) into a glass cell in the dynamic light-scattering system. The kinetics of nucleation could be measured in terms of the nucleation induction time at different supersaturations. In order to study the effect of ChS on the nucleation of HAP, the nucleation kinetics experiments were also performed on the control solutions without additives. In all of the kinetics experiments, the temperature was controlled and fixed at 25 °C. Preparation of HAP Nanocrystal Self-assemblies—After performing nucleation kinetics experiments, we obtained the HAP precipitation from the supersaturated solutions (the concentrations of CaCl2 and K2HPO4 were 2.5 and 1.5 mm, respectively) in the presence and absence of ChS (10 mg/liter). The precipitate was washed with deionized water and acetone, respectively, and subsequently dried. Since several phases were possible during the precipitation of calcium phosphate aggregates from a supersaturated solution (22Elliott J.C. Structure and Chemistry of the Apatites and Other Calcium Orthophosphates. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1994: 9-50Google Scholar), x-ray diffraction analyses were carried out in order to confirm the obtained crystalline phases under the above conditions. The results showed that the samples were mainly hexagonal HAP crystals (cf. Fig. 2). ζ Potential Measurement and Equilibrium Dialysis—As shown in Fig. 1, chondroitin 4-sulfate consists of repeated disaccharide units ((C14H20O14NS)n), which possess acidic groups such as carboxylic and sulfate groups. In order to obtain a good understanding on the electrochemical properties of ChS, a ζ potential measurement of ChS in an aqueous solution with a concentration of 100 mg/liter at pH 6 was performed on a ζ potentiometer (Zetasizer 2000; The Malvern Instruments). Then a series of solutions with ChS and various concentrations of CaCl2 were also measured to study the effect of the calcium ion on the ζ potential of chondroitin sulfate. Equilibrium dialysis of ChS was performed with the dispo-equilibrium dialyzers, which consist of two chambers separated by a dialysis membrane with a molecular mass cut-off of 5 kDa. The apparatus for equilibrium dialysis was washed with 10 mm EDTA, followed by an extensive wash with deionized water. The upper chambers were filled with ChS solution with a concentration of 100 mg/liter. The bottom chambers were filled with the dialysis buffer containing CaCl2 varying from 10 μm to 3 mm plus trace 45CaCl2 (Amersham Biosciences). Dialysis was carried out for 24 h at room temperature, and the radioactivity from 45Ca in the bottom and the upper chambers was measured by using a Beckman LS-6500 liquid scintillation counter. The bound and free Ca2+ was then counted, and the dissociation constant Kd was determined by Scatchard analysis (23Scatchard G. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy and Electron Diffraction—A scanning electron microscope study of the HAP crystallite nanostructure in precipitation was carried out using a scanning electron (SE) microscope (JEOL 6700F, Japan) at 10 kV after coating the sample with platinum to increase the conductivity. The microstructure of the HAP assemblies obtained from the solutions was also observed by using a high resolution transmission electron microscope (JEOL 3010) and electron diffraction techniques. Kinetic Model for Biomineral Nucleation—In most cases, biomineralization is associated with the formation of a new crystalline phase from the ambient phase via nucleation followed by growth (24Mutaftschiev B. Handbook of Crystal Growth. North-Holland, Amsterdam1993: 187-248Google Scholar). This implies that nucleation, as the first step of biomineralization, plays an important role in building up a complex structure. As we know, a positive thermodynamic driving force is required for HAP crystallization, which is defined as in Ref. 25Zettlemoyer A.C. Nucleation. Dekker, New York1969: 225-307Google Scholar,Δμ=kTln(1+σ)=kTln[a(Ca2+)]5[a(PO43-)]3[a(OH-)]Ksp(HAP)(Eq. 1) where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, Ksp is the solubility product, and a(i) is the activity of species i. σ is defined as the supersaturation of a solution, being the source of a driving force for mineralization in solutions. In nature, nucleation is under the control of a kinetic process in which HAP nuclei overcome a kinetic barrier, the so-called nucleation barrier (ΔG*) at a given thermodynamic driving force Δμ (25Zettlemoyer A.C. Nucleation. Dekker, New York1969: 225-307Google Scholar). Taking into account the effect of the substrate on both the nucleation barrier and the transport process, the nucleation rate is given according to the model (21Liu X.Y. Sato K. Nakajima K. Furukawa Y. Advances in Crystal Growth Research. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam2001: 42-61Crossref Google Scholar, 26Liu X.Y. J. Chem. Phys. 2000; 112: 9949-9955Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar) as follows,J=(Rs)2N0f''(m)[f(m)]1/2Bexp[-ΔGhomo*kTf(m)](Eq. 2) withΔGhomo*=16πγcf3Ω23[kTln(1+σ)](Eq. 3) andf(m)=14(2-3m+m3)(Eq. 4) where Rs and N0 are the radius and the density of the substrates, respectively, B is the kinetic constant, ΔG*homo is the homogeneous nucleation barrier, γcf is the specific interfacial free energy between the crystals and the mother phase, and Ω is the volume of the growth units. m is a function of the interfacial free energy difference between the phases of crystal, fluid, and substrate, and it depends on the interaction and interfacial structural match between the crystalline phase and the substrate (27Jiang H.D. Liu X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41286-41293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). According to Equation 2, in the presence of substrates the nucleation barrier assumes the following form,ΔG*=ΔGhomo*f(m)(0≤f≤1)(Eq. 5) where f(m) is the interfacial correlation factor describing the lowering of the nucleation barrier ΔG* due to the occurrence of foreign bodies. Notice that the factor f(m) varies from 0 to 1, depending on the correlation and structure match between the nucleating phase and the substrate (foreign bodies) (28Liu X.Y. Langmuir. 2000; 16: 7337-7345Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When the interaction between the nucleating phase and the substrate is optimal, one has f(m) → 0(cf. Equation 4). Conversely, if the interfacial correlation is very poor, one has f(m) → 1, meaning that the substrate exerts almost no influence on the nucleation barrier. Under such conditions, the nucleation of HAP will become very difficult. Obviously, the influence of foreign particles such as dust particles, proteins, or even existing HAP crystallites, etc., on the nucleation barrier, and the association between the nucleating phase and the substrate can be fully characterized by this factor. Since a direct measurement of the nucleation rate is difficult, to characterize the kinetics of nucleation, one of the most common ways is to measure the nucleation induction time (ts) at different supersaturations. By definition (21Liu X.Y. Sato K. Nakajima K. Furukawa Y. Advances in Crystal Growth Research. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam2001: 42-61Crossref Google Scholar), the nucleation rate J can be expressed as follows,J≅1/(tsV)(Eq. 6) where V is the volume of the system. Combining Equations 2 and 6 yields the following,lnts=κf(m)[ln(1+σ)]2-ln{V(Rs)2N0f''(m)[f(m)]1/2B}(Eq. 7) where κ = 16πγcf3Ω2/3(kT)3, which remains constant under a given condition. It follows then from Equation 7 that for HAP nucleation, the plot ln(ts) versus 1/[ln(1 + σ)]2 will give rise to a straight line for a given f(m). As illustrated in Fig. 3, in the case of nucleation promotion (transition from curve 0 to curve 1), the adsorption of additives on the original substrate will lead to a stronger interaction and a better structural match between the substrate and the nucleating phase. This will then result in a decrease of the nucleation barrier. Since for a given nucleation system, κ is constant, such a change can then be identified from the lowering of the slope (corresponding to κf(m)) and the increase of the intercept of the ln(ts) versus 1/[ln(1 + σ)]2 plot (cf. Equation 7). Conversely, if the adsorption of additives leads to repulsion and an interfacial structure mismatch between the substrate and the nucleating phase, it results in a larger nucleation barrier. The inhibition effect can be identified from the increase in the slope and the decrease of the intercept (cf. curve 0 to curve 2 in Fig. 3). Therefore, in the following discussion, we can apply these parameters to analyze the effect of the biomolecule on the kinetics of HAP nucleation. Effect of ChS on the Nucleation Kinetics of HAP—ChS, as the main glycosaminoglycan of tissue and proteoglycan in the extracellular matrix of cartilage and bone, plays an important role in mineralization (18Goldberg M. Rapoport O. Septier D. Palmier K. Hall R. Embery G. Young M. Ameye L. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In nature, biomineralization is a highly complex process. To obtain a good understanding on the rigorous mechanisms of biomineralization, we examined the effect of ChS on the nucleation kinetics of HAP in our experiments, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 and TABLE ONE.TABLE ONEEffect of ChS on the interfacial correlation parameters for HAP nucleation κf(m) is the slope of the corresponding curve. σ*1→2 corresponds to the supersaturation for the transition f(m1) → f(m2).Additivesκf(m1) × 104Intercept Iκf(m2) × 104Intercept IIσ*1→2 × 1014Deionized water10.5-95.221.0-193.91.54ChS (0.001% weight)8.3-73.414.0-125.32.12 Open table in a new tab As mentioned earlier, the resultant effect of additives can be decided by the changes of slope and intercept of the line (cf. Fig. 3), whether in nucleation promotion or nucleation inhibition. Therefore, we identify in our system the effect of ChS on nucleation and analyze the change of the structure correlation between the HAP crystal and the substrate (including dust, foreign particles, HAP crystallites, etc.) in terms of the variation of the interfacial correlation factor f(m). As shown in Fig. 4A, both curves (in the absence of additives and in the presence of ChS) can in principle be fit by two intersecting straight lines with different slopes, which divide the supersaturation space into two regimes at σ* (or σ*′). The occurrence of two lines indicates that the nucleation is controlled by two values of f(m) within the supersaturation regimes. For the control curve, in regime I, a low value of f(m1) corresponds to a good structural match, resulting in growing crystals that are well orientated and ordered with respect to the structure of the substrate (29Liu X.Y. Lim S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 888-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the range of supersaturation in this regime is very narrow. As the supersaturation increases from regime I to II, f(m) increases from 1.05 × 105/κ to 2.10 × 105/κ (cf. Fig. 4B), resulting in a mismatch branching emerging on the substrate (Fig. 4A, bottom right inset). This indicates that an increase in supersaturation tends to drive the interfacial structure correlation between the substrate and HAP from a match state to a mismatch state, i.e. the so-called supersaturation-driven interfacial structure mismatch (29Liu X.Y. Lim S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 888-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A comparison with the control curve shows that the presence of ChS results in a decrease in f(m) and an increase in the intercept of the corresponding lines (cf. Fig. 4, A and B), which is in good agreement with the case of nucleation promotion (Fig. 3). This implies that the adsorbed ChS can modify the original substrates and lead to a stronger interaction and a better structural match between the substrate and HAP, which results in an orderly crystallite assembly, albeit at high supersaturation (Fig. 4A, top left inset). In addition, the factor f(m1) (8.3 × 104/κ), referring to regime I′ and corresponding to nucleation under the influence of ChS, is much lower than that in the control sample in regime I. This indicates that ChS can also lower the nucleation barrier by improving the interfacial structure correlation, especially at low supersaturations (cf. Equation 5). Therefore, the nucleation of HAP will be best templated by substrates in this case. Here, we should highlight an important point; σ* is shifted to a larger value in the presence of ChS (cf. Fig. 4B), which corresponds to a larger regime I. This indicates that ChS can stretch the structural match domain toward a much higher supersaturation and suppress the supersaturation-driven structural mismatch. This in turn will facilitate the formation of perfectly aligned HAP assemblies in a larger regime. The effect was verified by our experiments as shown in Fig. 6, to be discussed below. Therefore, this structural match transition effect is extremely important in engineering biomaterials with self-assembled structures. Nucleation and Growth of Self-assembled HAP Crystallites with the Effect of ChS—For the initial mineralization to occur, the calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyl ions of HAP must come together with the correct orientation and with sufficient energy to form a nucleus. Apart from the above analyses on nucleation kinetics, here we discuss the promotion effect of ChS on self-assembled HAP crystallites from the viewpoints of molecular interfacial structure and properties. Chondroitin 4-sulfate is a linear polysaccharide of repeated disaccharide units (Fig. 1). Such a unit contains sulfate groups and carboxylate groups. The combination of these two functional groups will provide a high density of negative charge. This was verified by a ζ potential measurement. The ζ potential was -38.4 mV for the ChS aqueous solution with a concentration of 100 mg/liter at pH 6. To understand well the electrochemical properties of ChS, we also studied the effect of the calcium ion on the ζ potential of ChS. Fig. 5 shows the ζ potential of ChS as a function of the calcium ion concentration. It is highly negative at low Ca2+ concentration, whereas the ζ potential rapidly increases as the concentration increases. The behavior of the ζ potential indicates the strong calcium ion binding of ChS molecules. The reason is that Ca2+ is a multivalent cation, which is easily electrostatically bound to the negatively charged surface of ChS. Therefore, adding Ca2+ leads to a less negative ζ potential. To investigate the calcium binding capacity of ChS, equilibrium dialysis was carried out using a microdialyzer system, and the results are shown in Fig. 5B. The data obtained from the dialysis enabled us to determine the dissociation constants Kd and the number of binding sites. As shown in the Scatchard plot (Fig. 5B, inset), ChS exhibits a markedly biphasic Ca2+ binding within the Ca2+ concentration used. This suggests that ChS contains two Ca2+ binding sites with different affinities. These data fit well with the two-site binding model and yielded a high affinity Ca2+ binding site (Kd = 2.0 μm) and a modest affinity Ca2+ binding site (Kd = 15.2 μm). The result of our dialysis experiment is consistent with previous studies, which indicated that the interaction with calcium is strong for ChS (30Rodriguez-Carvajal M.A. Imberty A. Perez S. Biopolymers. 2003; 69: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Millane R.P. Mitra A.K. Arnott S. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 903-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The main binding sites imply the sulfate group and the carboxyl group of the disaccharide units. This position has been identified in salts of chondroitin 4-sulfate (31Millane R.P. Mitra A.K. Arnott S. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 903-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of molecules will facilitate the nucleation of HAP (Fig. 6A) by binding with Ca2+ and hence by producing locally a high degree of supersaturation (32Lindahl U. Hook M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 385-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 33Hunter G.K. Bader S.M. J. Theor. Biol. 1989; 138: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Binding studies have also demonstrated that ChS can easily bind to HAP, with a semirigid conformation (34Rees S.G. Wassell D.T.H Embery G. Biomaterials. 2002; 23: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 35Hall R. Embery G. Waddington R. Gilmour A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1995; 56: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ChS has been shown to bind preferentially to the (100) face of the HAP crystal. Therefore, once HAP crystallites occur in the solution, ChS will be easily adsorbed on the prism faces of HAP due to its negatively charged surfaces, as shown in Fig. 6B. The adsorption of ChS on the surface of parent HAP crystallites will change the interfacial properties by the functional groups. For instance, the sulfate group plays an important role not only in increasing the stiffness of the molecule but also in creating new binding sites for calcium cations at the substrate. These spatially periodic functional groups, occurring on the surface of the substrate and providing a consistent number of binding sites, could largely lower the nucleation barrier, thus functioning as a template for orientated HAP nucleation. As illustrated in Fig. 6C, the favorable binding sites for calcium ions facilitate the formation of additional nuclei (secondary nucleation) on the prism faces of parent crystals. Meanwhile, since ChS has a high and specific affinity for HAP, the nuclei can be stabilized by ChS on the surface of the parent crystallite. Besides, due to the slow surface integration kinetics, the prism faces of the HAP crystallites correspond to a higher surface supersaturation. It follows that epitaxial nucleation and growth can occur on the prism face of HAP. The nature and strength of the interaction of ChS with HAP and calcium ions has important implications not only in regulating crystal nucleation, but also in regulating the orientation and the size of the growing crystals. Due to the adsorption of ChS on the prism faces of HAP, the negatively charged surface of ChS causes a higher local concentration of Ca2+ around the prism faces than in the bulk. Besides, the growth rate of the prism face is much slower than in the axial direction (21Liu X.Y. Sato K. Nakajima K. Furukawa Y. Advances in Crystal Growth Research. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam2001: 42-61Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, those crystallites growing along the prism of parent crystals have a larger growth rate, since they can make the best of the higher surface surpersaturation on the prism faces. As illustrated in Fig. 6D, as the nucleation and growth of nuclei proceed further, an orientated HAP assembly will be formed by the growth and coalescence of crystallites on the surface of the modified substrate. In addition, although ChS could initially stabilize the nuclei, the coating of the parent crystals with the macromolecule might block further growth, thereby preventing the formation of large size minerals. Biomimetic Formation of Self-aligned HAP Nanocrystallites and Implications in Engineering of Mineralized Tissues and Functional Materials—Since evidence from the nucleation kinetics experiments supports the template effect of ChS, we undertook to verify the above analysis and predictions. HAP aggregates were formed from the solutions with and without ChS at the same supersaturation in regime II (cf. Fig. 4). By employing a combined electron microscope and electron diffraction technique, we studied their microstructure. As shown in Fig. 7A, SE micrographs and especially a higher magnification SE micrograph (inset) indicate that needle-like HAP nanocrystallites obtained from the solution in the absence of ChS are assembled in a disordered or random manner. The orientations of the HAP crystallites in porous aggregates are random. This is a consequence of the poor interfacial correlation between HAP and the substrates during the nucleation process, in good agreement with our prediction based on the kinetic analysis. Therefore, the crystallization process in such a case will lead to an open and porous structure due to the supersaturation-driven structural mismatch (29Liu X.Y. Lim S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 888-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and we may then obtain porous and brittle tissues in biotechnological applications. However, the HAP crystallite aggregates formed in the presence of ChS at the same supersaturation show a remarkable difference in microstructure. SE micrographs in Fig. 7B reveal a compact and ordered microstructure of HAP assemblies. In each assembly, the HAP nanocrystallites mediated by ChS are aligned parallel to each other. Besides, transmission electron micrographs (Fig. 7C) show compact and aligned HAP crystallite assemblies, which are consistent with the SE observations. The microstructure was also confirmed by a selected area electron diffraction pattern (Fig. 7C, top right) taken from a HAP assembly: the presence and orientation of the diffraction arcs corresponding to the (002) and (004) planes indicate preferential alignment of the HAP crystallites with their c axes along the long axis of the bundle. This implies that ChS improved the interfacial structure match between HAP crystallites and substrates during the nucleation process. Therefore, composites such as hard tissues resulting from mineralization under such a condition will become compact, orderly, and tough. The biomimetic formation experiments demonstrate that ChS is capable of facilitating the formation of an ordered HAP assembly by suppressing the supersaturation-driven structural mismatch, as predicted in the kinetics and interfacial structure analysis. In addition, our study on the nucleation kinetics of self-assembly HAP implies wide ranging applications. For example, the role of ChS in the construction of the composites may provide a direct guide for engineering of hard tissues and high performance biomaterials. As we know, natural materials such as bone and tooth are nanocomposites of proteins and minerals with hierarchical structure and superior strength. Based on our study, taking advantage of self-assembled properties, formation of ordered nanobiocomposites could be achieved by means of improving the interfacial structure match by a suitable organic matrix and careful control of conditions such as supersaturation and pH. In summary, we have studied the nucleation kinetics of HAP and quantified the effect of ChS on HAP nucleation. Both nucleation and biomimetic formation experiments demonstrate that ChS can suppress the supersaturation-driven interfacial structure mismatch and promote the formation of a highly ordered HAP crystallite assembly. The templating effect of ChS on the nucleation of HAP was analyzed not only from the viewpoint of nucleation kinetics but also from the viewpoint of a molecular structure match. These findings will enable us to obtain a better understanding of the fundamentals of the biomineralization of self-assembled hybrid structures and provide important design principles for hard tissue engineering and the development of biocompatible materials.

https://openalex.org/W2114282609,"In adult myocardium, excitation-contraction coupling is critically regulated by sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release via type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2), but generally, it is believed that SR-function is rudimentary in the fetal heart and in embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived cardiomyocytes (ESCMs), a possible source for cell replacement therapies. This study used wild-type (RyR2+/+) and RyR2 null (RyR2-/-) ESCMs as an in vitro model of cardiomyogenesis, together with pharmacological approaches and expression profiles of genes relevant for SR function, to elucidate the functional importance of RyR2 and SR on the regulation of Ca2+ transients and contraction during early cardiomyocyte development. During differentiation of RyR2+/+ ESCMs, SR function developed progressively with increased basal cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), enhanced frequency and amplitude, and decreased duration of Ca2+ transients that were inhibited by ryanodine and thapsigargin. These functional traits correlated with SR Ca2+ load and the expression of RyR2, SERCA2a, and phospholamban. RyR2-/- ESCMs, comparatively, demonstrated a significantly prolonged time-to-peak and reduced frequency of Ca2+ transients and contractions. Beta-adrenergic stimulation of RyR2+/+ ESCMs increased the frequency and amplitude of Ca2+ transients with differentiation but was much weaker in RyR2-/- ESCMs. We conclude that functional SR and control of RyR2-mediated SR Ca2+ release directly contribute to the spontaneous and beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated contraction of ESCMs, even at very immature stages of development."

We have solved the three-dimensional structure of the major surface protein BclA on B. anthracis spores. Surprisingly, the structure resembles C1q, the first component of complement, despite there being no sequence homology. Although most assays for C1q-like activity, including binding to C1q receptors, suggest that BclA does not mimic C1q, we show that BclA, as well as C1q, interacts with components of the lung alveolar surfactant layer. Thus, to better recognize and invade its hosts, this pathogenic soil bacterium may have evolved a surface protein whose structure is strikingly close to a mammalian protein.

Thus, to better recognize and invade its hosts, this pathogenic soil bacterium may have evolved a surface protein whose structure is strikingly close to a mammalian protein. Anthrax is a disease that was first described over a century ago and one of the first diseases for which a microbial cause was also determined. The infection is propagated by spores of Bacillus anthracis, which can penetrate into the mammalian host by ingestion, inoculation, or inhalation. The latter mode of infection is the most severe, with rapid progression of the disease and a mostly fatal outcome (1Dixon T.C. Messelson M. Guillemin J. Hanna P.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The spore is a dormant cell form of some microorganisms characterized by high resistance to chemicals and to environmental factors, such as heat and drought, which allow the organism to persist in the environment for decades. After penetrating host tissues, B. anthracis spores germinate into the vegetative, lethal form.The early stages of B. anthracis infection and the role of the host defenses in the lung are still unclear. A study by confocal microscopy (2Guidi-Rontani C. Weber-Levy M. Labruyère E. Mock M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) shows that spore germination takes place within the macrophages, where the bacilli start producing toxins, including the lethal factor, protective antigen, and edema factor. Production of these toxins leads to macrophage apoptosis and the release of vegetative bacilli into the bloodstream, causing septicemia and death (3Dixon T.C. Fadl A.A. Koehler T.M. Swanson J.A. Hanna P.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). On the other hand, macrophages appear to protect animals against infection due to inhalation of the spores by eliminating them (4Cote C.K. Rea K.M. Norris S.L. van Rooijen N. Welkos S.L. Microb. Pathog. 2004; 37: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Another protective barrier that B. anthracis spores will encounter upon inhalation by the host is the epithelial surface of lung alveoli, which is coated with a thin layer of pulmonary surfactant. Pulmonary surfactant is a lipid-protein complex that plays two roles, a mechanical role by reducing the surface tension in the alveolus (which prevents it from collapse during expiration) and an important role in lung defense against infections (5McCormack F.X. Whitsett J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This immune function is attributed to surfactant proteins (SPs) 2The abbreviations used are: SPsurfactant proteinTNFtumor necrosis factor.2The abbreviations used are: SPsurfactant proteinTNFtumor necrosis factor. SP-A and SP-D, two hydrophilic members of the collectin family that can interact with pathogen surfaces, promote their destruction, and thus prevent infections (6Crouch E. Wright J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 521-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The two other surfactant proteins, SP-B and SP-C, are highly hydrophobic, the latter having been shown to bind bacterial lipopolysaccharides and modulate their cellular effects (7Augusto L.A. Li J.

Electron microscopy has revealed that the exosporium is composed of a paracrystalline basal layer with a hexagonal lattice structure and a hair-like outer region (9Gerhardt P. Ribi E. J. Bacteriol. 1964; 88: 1774-1789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated B. anthracis exosporia contain at least 12 major protein components (10Redmond C. Baillie L.W.J Hibbs S. Moir A.J.G Moir A. Microbiology (Read.). 2004; 150: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), one of the most prominent of which was named BclA (for Bacillus collagen-like protein of anthracis) (11Sylvestre P. Couture-Tosi E. Mock M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), encoded by the bclA gene. BclA is highly glycosylated (12Daubenspeck J.M. Zeng H. Chen P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 30945-30953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), is the immunodominant antigen of the spore surface (13Steichen C.T. Chen P. Kearney J.F. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and was shown to be the structural constituent of the exosporium filaments (11Sylvestre P. Couture-Tosi E. Mock M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The length of bclA differs between strains of B. anthracis, encoding proteins of different sizes. All of these proteins possess an internal collagen-like region of GXX repeats of variable length (from 17 to 91 GXX repeats), which include a large proportion of GPT triplets) (11Sylvestre P. Couture-Tosi E. Mock M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the length of the BclA collagen-like region is responsible for the variation in filament length (14Sylvestre P. Couture-Tosi E. Mock M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1555-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Boydston J.A. Chen P. Steichen C.T. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5310-5317Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Collagen-like sequences are rare in microorganisms, but have been identified in some bacteria and viruses (16Rasmussen M. Jacobson M. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32313-32316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Their function is generally not clear, but they are found in surface proteins. Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus thuringiensis, species close to B. anthracis, both possess a protein related to BclA in their the exosporia (17Todd S.J. Moir A.J.G Johnson M.J. Moir A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3373-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). There is no sequence similarity, however, between the C-terminal portion of BclA and proteins of known structure.To obtain insight into the function of this abundant surface protein, we have determined the crystal structure of a recombinant form of BclA. While the collagen-like N-terminal third of the sequence is disordered in the crystal lattice, the structure of the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein is remarkably similar to that of the globular domain of human C1q (18Gaboriaud C. Juanhuix J. Gruez A. Lacroix M. Darnault C. Pignol D. Verger D. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46974-46982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), the first component of complement, which belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like family of proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSCrystal Structure Determination—Recombinant BclA preparation, purification, and crystallization have been described elsewhere (19Salamitou S. Réty S. Le Hégarat F. Leblon G. Lewit-Bentley A. Acta Crystallogr. 2005; D61: 344-349Google Scholar). The structure was determined using a single heavy atom derivative with data from a laboratory source (19Salamitou S. Réty S. Le Hégarat F. Leblon G. Lewit-Bentley A. Acta Crystallogr. 2005; D61: 344-349Google Scholar). High resolution data were collected on the ID14–2 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility equipped with an ADSC Q4 detector using a 0.933 Å wavelength. Data reduction was performed using the XDS program package (20Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3214) Google Scholar). Further data treatment was carried out with programs from the CCP4 suite (21CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Google Scholar), with the CCP4 version of REFMAC used for refinement.Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Far UV (190–250 nm) circular dichroism measurements were carried out using thermostated 0.2 mm path length quartz cells in a Jobin-Yvon CD6 instrument, calibrated with aqueous d-10-camphorsulfonic acid. BclA (2.9 mg/ml, determined by absorbance at 280 nm based on a theoretical absorbance of 0.120 at 1 mg/ml) was analyzed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Spectra were measured with a wavelength increment of 0.2 nm, integration time of 1 s, and a band pass of 2 nm. For stability studies, the signal at 221 nm was recorded as a function of temperature within the range 11–45 °C at a heating rate of 19 °C/h.Isolation of Surfactant Proteins—Human SP-A was purified from bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with alveolar proteinosis. After isolation of the surfactant by centrifugation, SP-A was extracted using sequential butanol and octyl glucoside extractions (22Hawgood S. Benson B.J. Schilling J. Damm D. Clements J.A. White R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Porcine SP-B and SP-C were prepared by an adaptation (23Perez-Gil J. Cruz A. Casals C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1168: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) of the method used by Cursted et al. (24Curstedt T. Jornvall H. Robertson B. Bergman T. Berggren P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).Radioiodination of Proteins—The iodogen method of Greenwood et al. (25Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6717) Google Scholar) was used with 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3a,6b-diphenylglycouril from Calbiochem and Na125I (0.78 MBq/ml) from ICN Biomedical Inc. (Irvine, CA). The specific activities of 125I-labeled BclA, C1q (from human serum, Calbiochem, purity >95%, in 135 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium phosphate and 40% glycerol), and SP-A were 2 × 106, 2.56 × 106, and 2.25 × 106 cycles/min/mg, respectively, and their purities were assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis and autoradiography.Binding to Surfactant Components—Solutions (100 μl) of hydrophobic surfactant constituents (phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk (Sigma), SP-C, or SP-B) dissolved in chloroform:methanol (1:1 by volume) were dispensed into wells (∼4 mg/well) of solvent-resistant (polypropylene) microplates and evaporated under vacuum. Solutions of the hydrophilic surfactant constituent SP-A (100 μl, 40 mg/ml, in a carbonate/bicarbonate pH 9.6 buffer) were incubated overnight at 4 °C in wells of polystyrene microplates (Immunolon 1; Dynatech). All plates were saturated by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 200 ml of 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in Tris buffer (5 mm with 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). After washing, the polypropylene and polystyrene plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C or 3 h at 37°C, respectively, with solutions (100 ml) of radiolabeled ligands (125I-BclA in Tris buffer plus 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 125I-C1q in Tris buffer plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin, or 125I-SP-A in Tris buffer plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin containing 2 mm CaCl2). Plates were then washed extensively, and the remaining bound radioactivity was recovered with 10% SDS and measured.RESULTSCharacterization of the Recombinant BclA Protein—BclA was used in all experiments as the recombinant histidine-tagged species. Its theoretical molecular mass is 21,389 Da (220 residues). When loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, however, BclA migrates as a 29-kDa polypeptide, which could be due to its unusual collagen-like sequence, with a high proline content (14%). The identity of the recombinant protein was therefore ascertained using mass spectrometry. A molecular mass of 21,270.8 Da was determined, compatible with the theoretical value of 21,258 Da after cleavage of the initial methionine (range of error 0.1–0.05%). An identical value was obtained for BclA recovered from washed and dissolved crystals.The protein crystallized in space group P6322 (a = 67.9 Å, c = 163.3 Å) with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The crystals diffracted to >1.8 Å on a laboratory source and to 1.4 Å at the synchrotron (TABLE ONE), yet the electron density revealed only two-thirds of the expected protein chain, although the entire protein was present in the crystals. The N-terminal third of the protein, consisting of the collagen-like region, is disordered (19Salamitou S. Réty S. Le Hégarat F. Leblon G. Lewit-Bentley A. Acta Crystallogr. 2005; D61: 344-349Google Scholar). We performed a circular dichroism study of the protein to determine whether the collagen triple helix can form in recombinant BclA in certain conditions. When measured at room temperature, the spectrum of BclA resembled that of a β-sheet containing protein with no sign of a collagen triple helical conformation (not shown). On cooling to 11 °C, however, a change in conformation occurred, with a marked decrease in ellipticity at 195 nm and an increase in ellipticity in the region of 210–230 nm (not shown). Such features are characteristic of collagen triple helix formation. When the ellipticity at 221 nm was monitored as a function of temperature, after pre-equilibration at 11 °C for 1 h, a sharp transition was detected at ∼18 °C (Fig. 1). This is typical of collagen triple helix unfolding, which for mammalian collagens normally occurs around body temperature (26Leikina E. Mertts M.V. Kuznetsova N. Leikin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). We conclude that the collagen triple helix in BclA can form at low temperature but not at the temperature used for crystallization.TABLE ONERefinement statistics R = Σ|Fo - Fc|/ΣFo; Rfree is defined in Ref. 49Brünger A.T.

A search for similar folds in structural data bases gave a strong structural relationship with the TNF-like family of proteins, ectodysplasin Eda-A1 with DALI (27Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3552) Google Scholar) (Z-score 16.1) and C1q with DEJAVU (28Kleywegt G.J. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard M. Jones T.A. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography. F. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 353-356Google Scholar) (DALI Z-score 14.6). The twelve β-strands, numbered sequentially A, A″, A′, B′, B, C, D, E, F, G, G′, and H, according to the TNF-like family conventions, are connected with the Greek key topology and form two β-sheets, each containing five strands, A′AHCF and B′BGDE respectively. The main difference with other members of the TNF-like family is the presence of the extra A″ and G′ strands that form a two-strand antiparallel β-sheet, packing together the AA′ and GH loops.FIGURE 2The structure of BclA (green) and C1q (mauve) monomers (A and B), respectively and their superposition (C). The N and C termini and the β-strands are labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Three monomers related by crystallographic symmetry form a tight, globular trimer of ∼50 Å in diameter. The total surface buried by the trimer formation is 1411 Å2/monomer, with two small cavities filled with solvent molecules at the center. The C and N termini come together on the bottom side of the trimer, with the N-terminal residues of the non-collagenous part intertwining and then pointing outwards (Fig. 3). The visible electron density is of excellent quality (19Salamitou S. Réty S. Le Hégarat F. Leblon G. Lewit-Bentley A. Acta Crystallogr. 2005; D61: 344-349Google Scholar), except for the very N- and C-terminal residues, where for the latter, only the first two His residues of the affinity tag are visible. Seven residues/monomer have two alternate conformations, four that lie on the surface of the trimer close to the crystallographic 2-fold axis and three that lie at the trimer interface within one of the two cavities.FIGURE 3BclA (A) and C1q (B) trimers viewed from the side and from above. The three monomers are colored blue, green, and red.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)BclA trimer assembly is very similar to other TNF-like trimers. Because of the shorter protruding loops, the overall shape of the BclA trimer is somewhat more globular than that of TNF, and it is slightly smaller than the globular head of C1q (by ∼5 Å in diameter). Upon trimer formation, the buried surface of 4234 Å2 is less than the equivalent surface areas in C1q (5490 Å2) or collagen VIII NC1 (6150 Å2). This is due both to its slightly smaller overall size but principally to the existence of a solvent-filled cavity within the trimer center.We do not see any cations (e.g. calcium) bound to the protein; indeed, there are no acidic residues in the region corresponding to the environment of the calcium sites in collagen X or C1q (which are nearly equivalent). On the other hand, in the high resolution electron density map, we have located a solvent ion that we have interpreted as cacodylate-sequestered from the crystallization buffer (a significant anomalous peak is visible when maps are calculated with data collected at a wavelength of 0.933 Å but none in maps from the 1.542 Å data). There are no other ions bound to the ordered part of the structure. The high resolution structure of the collagen VIII NC1 trimer does not show any bound calcium ions, because it lacks the appropriate ligands (29Kvansakul M. Bogin O. Hohenester E. Yayon A. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but there is a sulfate ion within the inner solvent-filled cavity. When the two structures are superimposed, the cacodylate and sulfate ions lie within 8 Å of each other in similar environments. They lie at the bottom of the solvent channel, which in both cases is lined with hydrophobic residues. Whether this capacity of sequestering ions from the surrounding solvent plays a functional role remains an open question for both proteins.Structural Alignment of BclA with TNF-like Proteins—It has already been pointed out that the non-collagenous part of collagen VIII and X, the globular domain of ACRP30 and the globular domain of C1q (gC1q) belong to the TNF-like family of proteins (30Brass A. Kadler K.E. Thomas J.T. Grant M.E. Boot-Hanford R.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The TNF-like family contains proteins sharing the same jelly roll fold, usually organized as trimers but with very diverse functions, from cytokine activity (TNF-α), metabolism regulation (ACRP30), and connective tissue organization (collagen VIII and X) to innate immunity (C1q). Despite the very low sequence identity of the C-terminal part of BclA with C1q, collagen VIII, or TNF (23, 25, and 11% identity, respectively), the three-dimensional structure of BclA is very similar to a TNF-like domain.The TNF-like family of proteins contains various members whose structures have been elucidated. We compared the structure of BclA with the globular domain of the three chains of C1q (18Gaboriaud C. Juanhuix J. Gruez A. Lacroix M. Darnault C. Pignol D. Verger D. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Arlaud G.J.

Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), collagen X (31Bogin O. Kvansakul M. Rom E. Singer J. Yayon A. Hohenester E. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 165-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), ACRP30 (32Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Current Biology. 1998; 8: 335-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), TNF-α (33Bayens K.J. De Bondt H.L. Rayemaekers A. Fiers W. De Ranter C.J. Acta Crystallogr. 1999; D55: 772-778Google Scholar), and CD40L (34Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. Wang J.H. Thompson J. Lederman S. Chess L. Thomas D. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The BclA monomer can be superimposed upon these structures with a root means square difference on C-α atoms of 1.2Å/84 equivalent residues, 1.3Å/89, 1.14Å/87, 1.3Å/82, and 1.2Å/72, for C1q A, B, C, collagen VIII, and TNF-α, respectively.The superimposed structures were used to make a structure-based alignment of BclA with known TNF-like structures (supplemental Fig. 1A). The alignment shows that the residues most conserved between members of the TNF-like family are also conserved in BclA; among residues Gly-159, Tyr-161, Phe-237, and Leu-242 (ACRP30 numbering), Gly and Tyr are conserved in BclA, Phe is replaced by an Ile with its side chain occupying the same position, and Leu is replaced by Val. Analysis of the alignment with ConSurf (35Glaser F. Pupko T. Paz I. Bell R.E. Bechor-Shental D. Martz E. Ben-Tal N. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 163-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) shows that the most conserved residues are either buried or involved in trimer formation, whereas the most variable residues map to the exposed surface of the trimer. Three residues on the surface of the trimer are moderately conserved. Gln-113, which corresponds to Asn in C1q and the collagens, lies close to Asn-181 (Asn in C1qA) of the next monomer within the trimer, close to its base. Ser-166 (Cys in all C1q subunits) lies close to the top end of the BclA trimer (supplemental Fig. 1B).Most of the differences are located in the loops connecting β-strands. Compared with TNF-like proteins recognized by specific TNF receptors (such as TNF-α and CD40L), BclA has shorter CD, DE, and EF loops, which were shown to be crucial for the binding of the ligand to its receptor. BclA does not have the exposed aromatic amino acids characteristic of the short chain collagens VII and X and that may be important for lateral interactions of the collagen molecules. Thus, on the basis of the length of the loops and the amino acid content, BclA is closer to C1q than to collagens or to TNF-like proteins.Search for a C1q-related Function—C1q plays a key role in innate immunity by recognition of immune complexes and the initiation of the classical complement pathway (36Reid K.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1983; 11: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We therefore tried to ascertain whether BclA might behave like C1q in this respect. We failed to show any significant interaction with immunoglobulins G by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by surface plasmon resonance (data not shown). BclA did not provoke lysis of activated red blood cells either. 3V. Frémeaux-Bacchi, personal communication.More recently it has been recognized that C1q can be directly involved in the triggering of defensive cellular functions, such as chemotaxis, release of cytokines, phagocytosis, and cytotoxicity (37Ghebrehiwet B. Peerschke E.I. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These are mediated by specific receptors present on the effector cell surface (38Eggleton P. Reid K.B. Tenner A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 428-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 39Tenner A.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whose precise mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Binding assays with calreticulin (cC1qR, receptor of the collagen-like domain of C1q) and with p33/gC1qR (receptor for the globular domain of C1q) were, however, also negative. Furthermore, unlike recombinant TNF-α, BclA fails to induce a secretion of interleukin-8 by lung epithelial A549 cells (data not shown).Binding of BclA to Lung Alveolar Surfactant Components—We next analyzed the binding of 125I-BclA to plates coated with phosphatidylcholine, the most abundant lipid in the surfactant, with SP-B and SP-C, its two hydrophobic protein components, and with SP-A, its most abundant hydrophilic constituent. The results show that, among all these molecules, only SP-C interacts with 125I-BclA (Fig. 4a) and that this interaction is dose-dependent (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, 125I-C1q also binds to plates coated with SP-C (Fig. 4c), thus suggesting that BclA and C1q recognize common targets in the alveolar compartment. In contrast, the collectin 125I-SP-A did not interact with plates coated with SP-C in the presence of calcium (data not shown).FIGURE 4Interaction of 125I-BclA and 125I-C1q with surfactant components.

The length of the fibers composing the hair-like surface of B. anthracis exosporium is related to the number of collagen-like repeats in BclA (14Sylvestre P. Couture-Tosi E. Mock M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1555-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), yet the role of the collagen-like sequence is unclear. Unfortunately, we do not see well defined electron density for this part of the molecule, despite the presence of the entire N-terminal polypeptide in our crystals. Indeed, the fact that the monomers in the trimer are related by strict crystallographic symmetry is incompatible with the formation of an ordered collagen-like triple helix (19Salamitou S. Réty S. Le Hégarat F. Leblon G. Lewit-Bentley A. Acta Crystallogr. 2005; D61: 344-349Google Scholar). We do not see even disordered electron density beyond Gly-80, however, and we therefore assume that the collagen-like N-terminal sequence is randomly oriented. Recombinant BclA may indeed have a less stable collagen part, because it was shown that glycosylation on Thr residues increases the stability of worm collagen (40Mann K. Mechling D.E. Bachinger H.P. Eckerskorn C. Gaill F. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) as well as synthetic (GPT)10 (41Bann J.G. Peyton D.H. Bächinger H.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) triple helices. Our thermal denaturation curves confirm that the temperature of the crystal growth (20–21 °C) is above the melting temperature (Tm) of the recombinant BclA, and thus the triple helix would be unstable even in solution. The C-terminal part of the protein forms a much more stable trimer, which was recently shown to crystallize spontaneously (15Boydston J.A. Chen P. Steichen C.T. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J.

https://openalex.org/W2081669201,"The tumor suppressor and transcription factor p53 is a key modulator of cellular stress responses, and activation of p53 can trigger apoptosis in many cell types, including neurons. We found that this nuclear protein was significantly phosphorylated when human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to in vitro oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids. To identify an oxidized lipid that induces p53 phosphorylation, we conducted a screening of lipid peroxidation products in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and identified 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE), a recently identified aldehyde originating from the peroxidation of ω6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, as a potential inducer of the p53 phosphorylation. We also found that ONE induced the phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated, which plays an essential role in transmitting DNA damage signals by the phosphorylation of p53. In addition, exposure of the cells to ONE resulted in an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and in a significant inhibition of proteasome activities, suggesting that ONE acted on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a regulatory mechanism of p53 turnover. In addition, the observation that the ONE-induced p53 response was associated with the induction of apoptosis suggested that ONE activated the p53-dependent apoptosis mechanism via activation of the p53 signaling pathway and down-regulation of the p53 turnover. Finally, we observed that the ONE-2′-deoxyguanosine adduct, 7-(2-oxo-heptyl)-substituted 1,N2-etheno-2′-deoxyguanosine, was accumulated in the spinal cord motor neurons of patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Lipid peroxidation in tissue and in tissue fractions represents a degradative process, which is the consequence of the production and the propagation of free radical reactions primarily involving membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), 2The abbreviations used are: PUFAspolyunsaturated fatty acidsALSamyotrophic lateral sclerosisATMataxia telangiectasia-mutatedFasLFas ligandHNE4-hydroxy-2-nonenalMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideONE4-oxo-2-nonenalsiRNAshort interfering RNATBARS2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive substancesRTreverse transcriptionPARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymerasemAbmonoclonal antibody13-HPODE(13S)-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineFforwardRreverse. 2The abbreviations used are: PUFAspolyunsaturated fatty acidsALSamyotrophic lateral sclerosisATMataxia telangiectasia-mutatedFasLFas ligandHNE4-hydroxy-2-nonenalMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideONE4-oxo-2-nonenalsiRNAshort interfering RNATBARS2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive substancesRTreverse transcriptionPARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymerasemAbmonoclonal antibody13-HPODE(13S)-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineFforwardRreverse. and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as in drug-associated toxicity, postischemic reoxygenation injury, and aging (1Gutteridge J.M. Halliwell B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). The peroxidative breakdown of polyunsaturated fatty acids has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of many types of liver injury and especially in the hepatic damage induced by several toxic substances. There is increasing evidence that aldehydes endogenously generated during the process of lipid peroxidation are causally involved in most of the pathophysiological effects associated with oxidative stress in cells and tissues (2Esterbauer H. Schauer R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5845) Google Scholar). Compared with free radicals, lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes are generally stable and can diffuse within or even escape from the cell and attack targets far from the site of the original free radical-initiated event, therefore suggesting that they are not only end products and the remnants of lipid peroxidation processes but also may act as mediators for the primary free radicals that initiated lipid peroxidation.Many types of mammalian cells undergo apoptosis during normal development or in response to a variety of stimuli, including DNA damage, growth factor deprivation, and the abnormal expression of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (3Raff M.C.

Apoptosis induced by these agents appears to be mediated by a common set of downstream elements that act as regulators and effectors of apoptotic cell death. In many cases, apoptosis requires the p53 tumor suppressor protein (6Fisher D.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 539-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). p53 encodes a transcription factor (7el Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D.

The induction of p53 mRNA has been associated with neuronal damage following excitotoxic or ischemic brain injuries (12Sakhi S. Bruce A. Sun N. Tocco G. Baudry M. Schreiber S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7525-7529Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in p53 were reported to be resistant to stroke-induced neuronal damage (13Crumrine R.C. Thomas A.L. Morgan P.F. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1994; 14: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and kainate-induced hippocampal cell death (14Morrison R.S. Wenzel H.J. Kinoshita Y. Robbins C.A. Donehower L.A. Schwartzkroin P.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its role in apoptotic cell death, p53 may also participate in regulating the cell cycle (15Ullrich S.J. Anderson C.W. Mercer W.E. Apella E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15259-15262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).p53 is the most frequently altered tumor suppressor gene in a wide spectrum of human cancer (16Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7411) Google Scholar) with a mutation frequency of up to 50% (17Caron de Fromentel C. Soussi T. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1992; 4: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In contrast to many cancers (18Vogan K. Bernstein M. Leclerc J.M. Brisson L. Brossard J. Brodeur G.M. Pelletier J. Gros P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5269-5273PubMed Google Scholar), p53 is not mutated in human neuroblastoma. Thus, several neuroblastoma cell lines, commonly used as models to study the differentiation and the development of neural cells in vitro (19Moll U.M. LaQuaglia M. Benard J. Riou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4407-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), can also be used in the study of the modulation of p53 family members after treatment with cytotoxic or cytostatic agents. In this study, based on an observation that the in vitro oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids significantly induced phosphorylation of p53 in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, we evaluated the effect of oxidized fatty acid metabolites on p53 phosphorylation, and we identified 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE), one of the major lipid peroxidation products, as an inducer of p53 phosphorylation in neuronal cells. To fully understand the signaling mechanism that triggers this response, the cellular events that may lead to the activation of p53 were investigated. Moreover, we investigated the presence of this aldehyde in the tissue from patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study demonstrates that the ONE is a potential inducer of the p53 pathway that involves ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and proteasome. The identification of ONE as a trigger of p53 signaling may provide new clues to the apoptotic mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—ONE was synthesized by the oxidation of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) dimethyl acetal with pyridinium dichlorochromate followed by HCl hydrolysis. Other aldehydes were purchased from the Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). The antibodies against p53 and ubiquitin were obtained from the Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibodies against phosphorylated p53 at Ser-15 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were purchased from the Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The anti-ATM monoclonal antibody and anti-phospho-ATM (Ser-1981) monoclonal antibody were obtained from the Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Charlottesville, VA), and the Rockland Immunochemical Co. (Philadelphia), respectively. The monoclonal antibody (mAb 6A3) against the ONE-2′-deoxyguanosine adduct, 7-(2-oxo-heptyl)-substituted 1,N2-etheno-2′-deoxyguanosine, was used for immunohistochemical detection of the ONE-modified DNA (20Kawai Y. Kato Y. Nakae D. Kusuoka O. Konishi Y. Uchida K. Osawa T. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). (13S)-Hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13-HPODE) was enzymatically synthesized from linoleate by soybean lipoxygenase as described previously (20Kawai Y. Kato Y. Nakae D. Kusuoka O. Konishi Y. Uchida K. Osawa T. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Cell Viability—Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were grown in Cosmedium-001 (Cosmo-Bio, Tokyo, Japan) containing 5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were seeded in plates coated with polylysine and cultured at 37 °C.Cell Viability—Cell viability was quantified by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Briefly, cells incubated with ONE were treated with 10 ml of MTT solution (5 mg/ml) for 4 h. The cells were then lysed with 0.04 n HCl in isopropyl alcohol, and the absorbance was read at 570 nm.Autoxidation of PUFAs—The autoxidation of the PUFAs, such as linoleate and arachidonate, was performed by incubating the emulsified PUFA (200 μg/ml) with Fe2+ (40 μm) and ascorbate (1 mm) in 30 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C.Lipid Peroxidation Assay—The degree of lipid peroxidation of the PUFAs was determined by measurement of the 2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). The reaction mixture (10 ml) was treated with 20 ml of 8.1% (w/v) SDS, 150 ml of 0.8% 2-thiobarbituric acid, 150 ml of 20% acetic acid, 70 ml of H2O and then boiled for 60 min. After cooling, the sample was centrifuged (11,000 × g, 3 min), and the absorbance of the supernatant solution was measured at 532 nm. Malondialdehyde bis(dimethyl acetal), which yields malondialdehyde by acid treatment, was used as the standard.Formation of ONE from 13-HPODE—13-HPODE (5 mm) was incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. ONE generated during the autoxidation of 13-HPODE was derivatized with a semicarbazide as described previously (21Hecht S.S. Young-Sciame R. Chung F.-L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 706-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The semicarbazone derivative of ONE was extracted with chloroform, evaporated, and dissolved in ethanol. Ten microliters of the aliquot was injected and analyzed on a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (Nomura Chemicals, Aichi, Japan; 4.6 × 250 mm) with a stepwise gradient of water/acetic acid (100:0.01, by volume) (solvent A), acetonitrile (solvent B) (time = 0-5 min (A 100%); 5-50 min (B 100%); 50-55 min (B 100%); 60 min (A 100%) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 300 nm.Nuclear Staining Assay—To determine the apoptotic nuclei, cells treated with 10 μm ONE for 4 h were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution and stained with a fluorescent DNA-binding dye, Hoechst 33258, and observed by using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).Analysis of DNA Fragmentation—For analysis of the DNA fragmentation by agarose gel electrophoresis, cellular DNA was extracted from whole cells treated with 10 μm ONE for 24 h. After treatment with ONE, the cells were harvested, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100), and the samples then left on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was transferred to another Eppendorf tube, and sequential extractions were carried out. RNase was added to the samples at the final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and proteinase K was then added to the mixture at the final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and the mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 30 min. Electrophoresis was performed on a 2.0% agarose gel, and DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining.Western Blot Analysis—The homogenates prepared from the cells were treated with SDS sample buffer and then immediately boiled for 5 min. The protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). To detect the immunoreactive proteins, we used horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse or goat IgG and ECL blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences).RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and spectrophotometrically quantified. The total RNAs (5 μg) were reverse-transcribed into cDNA and used for the RT-PCR analysis. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal standard. The PCR products were separated in a 1% agarose gel, and the positive signals were quantified by densitometry analysis after staining with ethidium bromide. The following primer pairs (Genset) were used: GADD45, forward (F), 5′-TGCCATTATCTCAAAGGTGA-3′, and reverse (R), 5′-GAAGCTGCTTATTCGCAGTA-3′; Fas, F, 5′-TTGCTGGAGTCATGACACTAAGTC-3′, and R, 5′-AACATCCTTGGAGGCAGAATCA-3′; MDM2, F, 5′-GGATCTTGATGCTGGTGTAAG-3′, and R, 5′-GCTACTAGAAGTTGATGGCTG-3′; Bax, F, 5′-GGTTTCATCCAGGATCGAGC-3′, and R, 5′-GAGGAAGTCCAATGTCCAGC-3′; and Bcl-2, F, 5′-AACTCCCAATACYGGCTC-3′, and R, 5′-GCCACACAGCCAACGTGCCAT-3′.Localization of p53—For the immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed overnight in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid at 4 °C. After the membranes were permeabilized by exposing the fixed cells to PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, the cells were sequentially incubated in PBS solutions containing blocking serum (5% normal goat serum) and immunostained with the anti-p53 antibody. The cells were then incubated for 1 h in the presence of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit, rinsed with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, and covered with anti-fade solution (1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine, 90% glycerol). Images of the cellular immunofluorescence were acquired using a confocal laser microscope (Zeiss) with a ×40 objective (488 nm excitation and 518 nm emission).Proteasome Activity—The proteasome activity was also evaluated using SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with the Proteasome Sensor Vector™ (Clontech). The ZsProSensor™ protein accumulated through the inhibition of the proteasome, resulting in a strong green emission signal, was measured by a flow cytometer (Epics XL, Beckman Coulter).RNA Interference Using siRNA—The siRNA for human ATM was generated by Santa Cruz Biotechnology. RL34 cells were seeded at 80% density the day before transfection. The cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000™ transfection reagent; 2.5 ml of siRNA stock (20 mm) and 5 ml of Lipofectamine 2000™ were each diluted with 250 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). After 5 min at room temperature, they were combined and incubated for 20 min. The reaction mixtures were over-laid on the cell culture for 6 h. The medium was then changed to a fresh one containing 5% fetal bovine serum.Immunohistochemical Detection of ONE-2′-Deoxyguanosine Adduct in Sporadic ALS Patients—The presence of the ONE-2′-deoxyguanosine adduct in vivo on spinal cords obtained at autopsy from five sporadic ALS patients (age, 52-79 (61.40 ± 8.81) years; sex, four males and six females) and five age-matched control individuals (sex, six males and four females; age, 52-75 (62.40 ± 7.62) years) without neurological disorders, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia was examined. Each autopsy was performed after the family members granted informed consent in accordance with the Ethical Guideline of Tokyo Women's Medical University and the Helsinki Declaration of 1983. The spinal cord specimens were processed for preparing formalin (10%)-fixed, paraffin-embedded materials stored at room temperature and OCT (Sakura Fine Technical, Tokyo, Japan) compound-embedded, frozen materials stored at -80 °C.Multiple 6-μm-thick sections were cut out from each spinal cord and used for hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining. The paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized, and some of the frozen sections were postfixed in 100% acetone. These sections were rehydrated, quenched for 10 min at 4 °C with 3% hydrogen peroxide for inhibiting endogenous peroxidase activity, rinsed in PBS, pH 7.6, pretreated for 30 min at room temperature with 3% skim milk in PBS for blocking any nonspecific antibody binding, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody (mAb 6A3). The immunoreaction was visualized by the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase complex method using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The chromogen was 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, and the counterstain was hematoxylin. Sections from which the primary antibodies were omitted served as negative reaction controls.Immunohistochemical localization of the ONE-2′-deoxyguanosine adduct was verified by light microscopy on consecutive sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin or immunostained for the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein or the microglial marker CD68.RESULTSInduction of p53 Phosphorylation by Oxidized PUFAsTo investigate whether lipid peroxidation is associated with the activation of p53, we evaluated the effect of the oxidized lipids on p53 phosphorylation in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. To this end, the cells were exposed to the oxidized lipids prepared upon incubation of the PUFAs (linoleate and arachidonate) with 40 μm Fe2+ and 1 mm ascorbate in 30 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. As shown in Fig. 1A, the autoxidation of linoleate with an Fe2+/ascorbate-mediated free radical-generating system was associated with the formation of TBARS. In parallel with the increase in the TBARS values, the p53 phosphorylation was significantly induced in the cells exposed to the oxidized linoleate. Arachidonate was more rapidly oxidized with the Fe2+/ascrobate compared with linoleate, and the p53 phosphorylation reached a plateau within 1 h before the TBARS values reached a maximum (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that the oxidized PUFAs represent the sources of a p53 phosphorylation inducer.Identification of ONE as a Selective Inducer of p53 PhosphorylationIn view of the fact that the generation of lipid hydroperoxides and reactive aldehydes is a phenomenon common in lipid peroxidation, we hypothesized that some of these reactive species might be involved in the p53 phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, the effect of authentic lipid hydroperoxides and reactive aldehydes on the p53 phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells was studied. Remarkably, among the tested oxidized lipids, the p53 phosphorylation was induced only by ONE (Fig. 2). The hydroxy and hydroperoxy fatty acids and other short chain aldehydes had no significant effects on the p53 phosphorylation. Of interest, HNE, an analog of ONE, was ineffective in the concentration range up to 20 μm (Fig. 3). These results suggest that ONE may be an active component that is involved in the induction of p53 phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to the oxidized PUFAs.FIGURE 2Identification of ONE as a selective inducer of p53 phosphorylation. SH-SY5Y cells were treated for 4 h with 10 μm of the indicated compounds, and induction of the p53 phosphorylation was examined by an immunoblot analysis.

Toxicol. 2000; 13: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effectiveness of lipid peroxidation as the origin of ONE, we examined the generation of ONE during the in vitro peroxidation of 13-HPODE following derivatization with semicarbazide (Fig. 4A). A time course analysis of the ONE generation during the autoxidation of 13-HPODE indeed revealed that significant amounts of ONE were generated during the peroxidation (Fig. 4B). This and the observation that the yield of ONE was almost comparable with that of HNE (data not shown) proved that ONE is one of the major products during lipid peroxidation.FIGURE 4Formation of ONE during lipid peroxidation. A, derivatization of ONE with semicarbazide. B, time-dependent formation of ONE during autoxidation of 13-HPODE. 13-HPODE (5 mm) was incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. ONE generated during autoxidation of 13-HPODE was derivatized with semicarbazide, and the semicarbazone derivative of ONE was analyzed by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ONE-induced Activation of the p53 PathwayActivation of p53—To confirm that the p53 accumulated in response to the treatment with ONE was functional, we assayed the subcellular localization of p53 and expression of the p53 target genes in cells treated with ONE. In parallel with the enhanced p53 phosphorylation, ONE induced p53 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). The dose-dependent effects of ONE were also analyzed at the same time of maximum induction (4 h), showing that even 5 μm of ONE produced an inducibility. Accompanied by the enhanced phosphorylation of p53, ONE enhanced the nuclear accumulation of p53 (Fig. 5, B and C).FIGURE 5Activation of p53 by ONE.

It has been shown that among them, ATM plays an essential role in transmitting DNA damage signals through phosphorylation of p53 (24Hammond E.M. Dorie M.J. Giaccia A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12207-12213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 25Hammond E.M. Giaccia A.J. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1117-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation of ATM at Ser-1981 activates the kinase and is largely responsible for phosphorylating p53 at Ser-15 in response to DNA damage (26Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2652) Google Scholar, 27Kurz E.U. Lees-Miller S.P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Hence, experiments were carried out to assess the possibility that the ONE-induced p53 response is mediated via the ATM function. As shown in Fig. 6A, ONE, but not HNE, induced ATM phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells. The pretreatment and continued presence of an ATM inhibitor (caffeine or wortmannin) partially reduced the ONE-induced phosphorylation of p53 (Fig. 6B), suggesting that ATM is involved in the p53 response to ONE. To provide evidence that there is a link between ATM and p53 in response to ONE, we wanted to know whether blockage of ATM signaling inhibited the ONE-induced p53 phosphorylation. To this end, we utilized RNA interference to block the expression of ATM in the SH-SY5Y cells. As shown in Fig. 6C, the SH-SY5Y cells expressing the ATM siRNA partially reduced the ATM levels. The reduced expression of the ATM was accompanied by reduced p53 phosphorylation in response to ONE. Thus, it appears that ONE activates p53 via ATM.FIGURE 6Involvement of ATM in the ONE-induced p53 phosphorylation. A, ONE, but not HNE, induces ATM phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2057613131,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) can be induced by various forms of stress such as exposure to high glucose, mechanical load, or hypoxia. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism involved in the induction of ctgf/ccn2 by hypoxia in a human chondrosarcoma cell line, HCS-2/8. Hypoxia increased the ctgf/ccn2 mRNA level by altering the 3'-untranslated region (UTR)-mediated mRNA stability without requiring de novo protein synthesis. After a series of extensive analyses, we eventually found that the cis-repressive element of 84 bases within the 3'-UTR specifically bound to a cytoplasmic/nuclear protein. By conducting a UV crosslinking assay, we found the cytoplasmic/nuclear protein to be a 35 kDa molecule that bound to the cis-element in a hypoxia-inducible manner. These results suggest that a cis-element in the 3'-UTR of ctgf/ccn2 mRNA and trans-factor counterpart(s) play an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation by determining the stability of ctgf/ccn2 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2107209867,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a critical component in transducing signals downstream of both integrins and growth factor receptors. To determine how the loss of FAK affects the epidermis in vivo, we have generated a mouse model with a keratinocyte-restricted deletion of fak (FAKK5 KO mice). FAKK5 KO mice displayed three major phenotypes – irregularities of hair cycle, sebaceous glands hypoplasia, and a thinner epidermis – pointing to defects in the proliferative capacity of multipotent stem cells found in the bulge. FAK-null keratinocytes in conventional primary culture undergo massive apoptosis hindering further analyses, whereas the defects observed in vivo do not shorten the mouse lifespan. These results suggest that the structure and the signaling environment of the native tissue may overcome the lack of signaling through FAK. Our findings point to the importance of in vivo and three-dimensional in vitro models in analyses of cell migration, proliferation, and survival. Surprisingly, the difference between FAKloxP/+ and FAKK5 KO mice in wound closure was not statistically significant, suggesting that in vivo loss of FAK does not affect migration/proliferation of basal keratinocytes in the same way as it affects multipotent stem cells of the skin."

Smad6, one of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) family downstream transcription factors, interacts with the N-terminal domain of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) through its Mad homology 2 domain and suppresses GR-mediated transcriptional activity in vitro. Adenovirus-mediated Smad6 overexpression inhibits glucocorticoid action in rat liver in vivo, preventing dexamethasone-induced elevation of blood glucose levels and hepatic mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, a well known rate-limiting enzyme of liver gluconeogenesis. Smad6 suppresses GR-induced transactivation by attracting histone deacetylase 3 to DNA-bound GR and by antagonizing acetylation of histone H3 and H4 induced by p160 histone acetyltransferase. These results indicate that Smad6 regulates glucocorticoid actions as a corepressor of the GR. From our results and known cross-talks between glucocorticoids and TGFβ family molecules, it appears that the anti-glucocorticoid actions of Smad6 may contribute to the neuroprotective, anticatabolic and pro-wound healing properties of the TGFβ family of proteins.

They are necessary for maintenance of many important biologic activities, such as homeostasis of intermediary metabolism, central nervous and cardiovascular system functions, and the immune/inflammatory reaction (1Chrousos G.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids also act as potent immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents at “pharmacologic” doses, properties that make them irreplaceable therapeutic means for many inflammatory, autoimmune, allergic, and lymphoproliferative diseases (2Chrousos G.P. Felig P. Frohman L.A. Endocrinology and Metabolism. 4th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 609-632Google Scholar). At high levels and over a long duration, glucocorticoids have neurotoxic, catabolic, and anti-wound healing properties as well as promoting gluconeogenesis, adipogenesis, and a shift of the T helper 1 to T helper 2 balance toward T helper 2 predominance (3Franchimont D.

Essays Biochem. 2004; 40: 137-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The GR consists of three domains, the N-terminal or “immunogenic” domain, the central, DNA-binding domain (DBD), and the C-terminal, ligand-binding domain. The functions of the latter two domains have been studied extensively, whereas those of the immunogenic domain are less well known (7Kino T. Chrousos G.P. Essays Biochem. 2004; 40: 137-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the unliganded state, the GR is located primarily in the cytoplasm (7Kino T. Chrousos G.P. Essays Biochem. 2004; 40: 137-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After binding to its agonist ligand, the GR undergoes conformational changes and translocates into the nucleus. Ligand-activated GR then binds to the glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) as a dimer and attracts several so-called coactivators and chromatin-remodeling factors to the promoter region through its two transactivation domains, activation function (AF)-1 and AF-2 (7Kino T.

Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). Among them, the p160 type histone acetyltransferase coactivators play an essential role in GR-induced transcriptional activity, being attracted to the promoter region in an early phase of transcriptional activation and facilitating access of other transcription-related molecules on the chromatin through acetylation of lysine residues located in several histone tails, such as those of histone H3 and H4 (8McKenna N.J.

Members of the Smad family of proteins transduce signals of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily members, such as TGFβ, activin, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), by associating with the cytoplasmic side of the type I cell surface receptors of these hormones (13ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 14Miyazono K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nine distinct vertebrate Smad family members have been identified, and they have been classified into three groups: receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), such as Smad1, -2, -3, -5, and -8; a common partner Smad (Co-Smad), Smad4; and inhibitory Smads (I-Smads) like Smad6 and Smad7 (13ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). All Smads have two characteristic domains, the Mad homology domains 1 and 2 (MH1 and -2), in their N-terminal and C-terminal portions, respectively, separated by a proline-rich linker region (13ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The MH1 domain of R- and Co-Smads is important for complex formation with other Smads, transcriptional activation and repression, and interaction with other transcription factors and target DNA sequences (13ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The MH2 domain of R-Smads mediates their interaction with cell surface receptors (13ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 15Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y. Pavletich N.P. Massague J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), whereas the highly conserved MH2 domain of I-Smads interacts with type I receptors and is sufficient for their inhibitory activity (14Miyazono K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding of TGFβ, activin, or BMP to their receptors, cytoplasmic R-Smads are phosphorylated by the receptor kinases, translocate into the nucleus, and stimulate the transcriptional activity of TGFβ-, activin-, or BMP-responsive genes by binding to their response elements located in their promoter regions as a heterotrimer with Co-Smad (13ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). I-Smads, such as Smad6 and Smad7, act as inhibitory molecules in the TGFβ family signaling by forming stable associations with activated type I receptors, which prevent the phosphorylation of R-Smads (13ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Smad6 also competes with Smad4 in the heteromeric complex formation induced by activated Smad1 (16Hata A. Lagna G. Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In addition, I-Smads directly suppress the transcriptional activity of TGFβ family signaling by binding to promoter DNA and attracting histone deacetylases and/or the C-terminal binding protein (17Bai S. Shi X. Yang X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8267-8270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18Bai S. Cao X. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 23: 9081-9093Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Since I-Smads are produced in response to activation of TGFβ family signaling (20Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), they literally function in the negative feedback regulation of the Smad signaling pathways. Smad6 preferably inhibits BMP signaling, whereas Smad7 is a more general inhibitor, repressing TGFβ and activin signaling in addition to that of BMP (14Miyazono K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we found that Smad6 interacts with the GR and suppresses the latter's transcriptional activity by attracting histone deacetylase HDAC3. HDAC3 antagonized histone acetylation induced by p160 type histone acetyltransferase coactivators. This inhibitory effect of Smad6 was present in vivo, suppressing glucocorticoid-stimulated gluconeogenesis in the rat liver. It is likely that Smad6 functions as a target tissue regulator of glucocorticoid action. Plasmids—pLexA-GR-(263-419) was described previously (21Kino T. Tiulpakov A. Ichijo T. Chheng L. Kozasa T.

Cell Cultures and Transfection—Human colon carcinoma HCT116 and uterine cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in McCoy's 5A or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. HCT116/MMTV cells, which were stably transformed with pMAM-neo-Luc that has the full-length MMTV promoter upstream of the luciferase gene, were maintained in the McCoy's medium containing 0.2 mg/ml neomycin and the same supplements. Rat hepatoma HTC cells were described previously (21Kino T. Tiulpakov A. Ichijo T. Chheng L. Kozasa T. Chrousos G.P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). HCT116 and HCT116/MMTV cells do not contain functional GR, whereas HeLa and HTC cells express fully active GR. HCT116 and HCT116/MMTV cells were transfected as previously described (21Kino T. Tiulpakov A. Ichijo T. Chheng L. Kozasa T. Chrousos G.P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For the experiments using pMMTV-Luc or other reporter genes for indicated nuclear receptors and transcription factors, different amounts of Smad6- or Smad7-related plasmids were cotransfected with 0.5 μg/well of the indicated nuclear receptor- or transcription factor-expressing plasmid, 1.5 μg/well of luciferase-expressing reporter plasmid, and 0.5 μg/well of pSV40-β-Gal. For stimulation of p53, CREB, or NF-κB transcriptional activity, 0.5 μg/well of pRc/CMV-hp53, RSV-PKA, or pRSV-RelA was cotransfected as well. Empty vectors were used to maintain the same amounts of transfected DNA. 10-6 m dexamethasone or progesterone, or 10-8 m aldosterone, dehydrotestosterone, or estradiol was added to the medium after 24 h of transfection. The indicated concentrations of tricostatin A (TSA) (Sigma), the histone deacetylase inhibitor, were also added to the medium at the same time. The cells were harvested after an additional 24 h, and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as previously described (24Kino T. Gragerov A. Kopp J.B. Stauber R.H. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Introduction of Smad6 Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into HTC Cells, the Tyrosine Aminotransferase (TAT) Assay, and the Real Time PCR—The rat Smad6 siRNA (5′-GCCACUGGAUCUGUCCGAUd-TdT-3′), which targets nucleotides 945-964 of the coding region (Gen-Bank™ accession number XM_345947), was produced by Qiagen (Valencia, CA). This sequence portion has the complete match to corresponding parts of the mouse and the human Smad6 sequences. The negative control siRNA (5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-3′) was also purchased from Qiagen. HTC cells were transfected with siRNAs by using the Nucleofector system (Amaxa GmbH, Cologne, Germany) with nearly 80% transfection efficiency, as previously described (21Kino T. Tiulpakov A. Ichijo T. Chheng L. Kozasa T. Chrousos G.P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after plating the cells in the 24-well plates, they were stimulated with 10-6 m dexamethasone. After an additional 24 h of incubation, cell lysates for the tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) assay and total RNA for the real time PCR were harvested. TAT assays were performed as previously reported (21Kino T. Tiulpakov A. Ichijo T. Chheng L. Kozasa T. Chrousos G.P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The reverse transcription reaction was carried out as previously described (27De Martino M.U. Bhattachryya N. Alesci S. Ichijo T. Chrousos G.P. Kino T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 820-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To detect mRNA levels of rat Smad6 and control rat acidic ribosomal phosphoproteinP0(RPLP0),primerpairs(Smad6,forward(5′-GAAGTCGTGTGGTCCCTGATC-3′) and reverse (5′-CTCGCAGTCACTCTCAG-3′); RPLP0, forward (5′-GACATGCTGCTGGCCAATAAG-3′) and reverse (5′-CAACATGTTCAGCAGTGTG-3′)) were used (21Kino T. Tiulpakov A. Ichijo T. Chheng L. Kozasa T. Chrousos G.P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The real time PCR was performed in triplicate using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI PRIZM 7700 SDS light cycler (Applied Biosystems), as previously described (27De Martino M.U. Bhattachryya N. Alesci S. Ichijo T. Chrousos G.P. Kino T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 820-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Obtained CT (threshold cycle) values of Smad6 were normalized for those of RPLP0, and their relative mRNA expression was demonstrated as -fold induction to the base line. The dissociation curves of the used primer pairs showed a single peak, and samples after PCRs had a single expected DNA band in an agarose gel analysis (data not shown). FLAG-Smad6-expressing Adenovirus, Injection into Rats, and Detection of the Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (PEPCK) and TAT Gene mRNAs—The following animal study was approved by the NICHD Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number ASP04-008). FLAG-tagged Smad6-expressing and control LacZ-expressing adenoviruses were described previously (28Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H. Sampath T.K. Enomoto S. Kawabata M. Kato M. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3801-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). 1 × 1010 colony-forming units of these adenoviruses were injected into the peritoneal cavity of 175-200-g Sprague-Dawley rats, and 1 mg/kg dexamethasone was injected intramuscularly after 24 h. After an additional 24 h, blood glucose levels were examined in total blood obtained by tail cut using a OneTouch monitor (LifeScan, Milpitas, CA). The rats were then sacrificed with CO2, and the livers were removed and stored at -70 °C until further use. Total RNA and whole homogenate of the liver were subsequently purified using the RNAeasy Midi kit (Quiagen) and homogenation/centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min in the buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and Complete™ tablets (1 tablet/50 ml), respectively. Levels of the PEPCK, TAT, and RPLP0 mRNA were then determined with the real time PCR reaction in quadruplicate using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, as described above. Primer pairs for detecting mRNAs of the hepatic PEPCK and TAT were as follows: PEPCK, forward (5′-CAGGCTGGCTAAGGAGGAAG-3′) and reverse (5′-CATCACTTGTCTCAGCCAC-3′); TAT, forward (5′-GTCGCTTCTTACTACCAC-3′) and reverse (5′-CAGGCAGGAGATTGTAGAG-3′) (21Kino T. Tiulpakov A. Ichijo T. Chheng L. Kozasa T. Chrousos G.P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27De Martino M.U. Bhattachryya N. Alesci S. Ichijo T. Chrousos G.P. Kino T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 820-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Whole homogenate of the liver was run on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and levels of GR and FLAG-Smad6 were examined in Western blots using anti-GR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-FLAG (M2) (Sigma) antibodies, respectively. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was performed in HCT116/MMTV and HTC cells, which have the genomically integrated MMTV-luciferase gene (HCT116/MMTV) and endogenous glucocorticoid-responsive TAT gene (HTC), respectively, using a chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) with minor modifications as previously described (27De Martino M.U. Bhattachryya N. Alesci S. Ichijo T. Chrousos G.P. Kino T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 820-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Charmandari E. Raji A. Kino T. Ichijo T. Tiulpakov A. Zachman K. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 3696-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). HCT116/MMTV cells were transfected with FLAG-Smad6- and/or HA-HDAC3-expressing plasmids together with pRShGRα using Lipofectin®. HTC cells were transfected with FLAG-Smad6- or GRIP1 (GR-interacting protein 1)-expressing plasmid using the Nucleofector system. Both cells were exposed to either 10-6 m dexamethasone or vehicle overnight. They were then fixed, DNA and bound proteins were cross-linked, and ChIP assays were performed by co-precipitating the DNA-protein complexes with anti-GRα (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), anti-FLAG (M2), anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GRIP1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or rabbit control IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibodies reacting to the acetylated histone H3 (Lys14) and H4 were purchased from Upstate. The promoter region -219 to -47 of the MMTV long terminal repeat (fragment size 173 bp), which contains two functional GREs, was amplified from the prepared DNA samples using a primer pair: 5′-AACCTTGCGGTTCCCAG-3′ and 5′-GCATTTACATAAGATTTGG-3′ (29Charmandari E. Raji A. Kino T. Ichijo T. Tiulpakov A. Zachman K. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 3696-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Tandem endogenous GREs of the rat TAT promoter, which are located ∼2,500 bp upstream of its transcription initiation site, were amplified by a primer pair: 5′-TCTTCTCAGTGTTCTCTATCAC-3′ and 5′-CAGAAACCGACAGGCGACTACG-3′ (fragment size 220 bp), as described previously (27De Martino M.U. Bhattachryya N. Alesci S. Ichijo T. Chrousos G.P. Kino T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 820-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Amplified products were then run on a 3% agarose gel, and visualized DNA bands were photographed. The real time PCR was directly performed using the primer pair that detects TAT GREs for some of the ChIP samples using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) as described above. Obtained CT values of ChIP samples were normalized for those of corresponding inputs, and their relative precipitations were demonstrated as -fold precipitation of the base line.

In this study we demonstrate that PI4KIIα is a novel GTP-independent target of the wasp venom tetradecapeptide mastoparan and that different mechanisms of activation occur in different subcellular membranes. Following cell membrane fractionation mastoparan specifically stimulated a high activity Golgi/endosomal pool of PI4KIIα independently of exogenous guanine nucleotides. Conversely, GTPγS stimulated a low activity pool of PI4KIIα in a separable dense membrane fraction and this response was further enhanced by mastoparan. Overexpression of PI4KIIα increased the basal phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity of each membrane pool, as well as the mastoparan-dependent activities, thereby demonstrating that mastoparan specifically activates this isozyme. Both mastoparan and M7, at concentrations known to invoke secretion, stimulated PI4KIIα with similar efficacies, resulting in an increase in the apparent Vmax and decrease in Km for exogenously added PI. Mastoparan also stimulated PI4KIIα immunoprecipitated from the raft fraction, indicating that PI4KIIα is a direct target of mastoparan. Finally we reveal a striking dependence of both basal and mastoparan-stimulated PI4KIIα activity on endogenous cholesterol concentration and therefore conclude that changes in membrane environment can regulate PI4KIIα activity.

The wasp venom peptide mastoparan stimulates signaling by Gi and G0 heterotrimeric G-proteins by enhancing the rate of dissociation of bound GDP, thereby allowing GTP to bind. Increased Gi and G0 signaling then activates a variety of cell-type-dependent events, including secretion and ion transport. However the targets of mastoparan are by no means limited to heterotrimeric G-proteins. Mastoparan is also known to affect the activity of phospholipase D2 (1.Chahdi A. Choi W.S. Kim Y.M.

Two membrane fractions containing PI4KIIα activity have been identified using sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation (12.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Anderson J.S. Balinger A. Blumenkrantz D. Calnan D.P. Cramer R. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and found to possess differing levels of intrinsic kinase activity both in intact membranes and in immunoprecipitates prepared from detergent lysates (13.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Blumenkrantz D. Anderson J.S. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The higher activity pool is found in membranes that possess the raft-like properties of high buoyancy in sucrose density gradients and resistance to detergent solubilization (12.Waugh M.G. Minogue S.

Sudhof T.C. Grichine N. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44366-44375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), rafting of PI4KIIα is likely to arise from palmitoylation of a cysteine-rich sequence within the kinase domain (residues 174–178, CCPCC), but whether or not a particular raft lipid environment is required for the high PI4KIIα activity is not known. The lower activity pool is less buoyant and contains the bulk of the enzyme (12.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Anderson J.S. Balinger A. Blumenkrantz D. Calnan D.P. Cramer R. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Blumenkrantz D. Anderson J.S. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Previous studies of the activation of PI4KII by mastoparan have assumed a dependence on G-protein activation (8.Gasman S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Hubert P. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16913-16920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 9.Panaretou C. Tooze S.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); however experiments have hitherto not addressed whether mastoparan activates either or both enzyme pools nor whether activation of either pool by mastoparan can occur directly. The established mechanisms by which mastoparan activates signaling involve the formation of an amphipathic α-helix from the random conformation present in free solution. The basic, helical peptide mimics the effector region of cognate G-protein-coupled receptors (16.Higashijima T. Uzu S. Nakajima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6491-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of calmodulin-binding proteins (17.Brown S.E. Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3389-3397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), leading to activation of Gi/0 and calmodulin, respectively. Two distinct modes of binding have been identified, one in which the peptide binds only to the target protein and another in which the peptide binds concomitantly to a membrane and a target protein. For example, in aqueous solution mastoparan binds directly to p67-phox (7.Tisch-Idelson D. Fridkin M. Wientjes F. Aviram I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and to calmodulin. Mastoparan binds to calmodulin in a helical conformation with low nanomolar affinity (18.Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 114: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast binding to purified Gi/0-proteins is weak, but micromolar affinities are afforded by the presence of membrane lipids (19.Higashijima T. Burnier J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14176-14186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this phenomenon arises from the fact that mastoparan adopts an amphipathic helical conformation at the lipid-aqueous interface (20.Higashijima T. Wakamatsu K. Takemitsu M. Fujino M. Nakajima T. Miyazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1983; 152: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21.Vold R.R. Prosser R.S. Deese A.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which mastoparan binds to PLD2, Rho, NDPK, glycogen phosphorylase, PLA2, and PI4KII has not yet been characterized; although NDPK, PLA2, and PI4KII may be activated indirectly, as a direct interaction with mastoparan has not been established. As with calmodulin and p67-phox, the interaction between mastoparan and Rho and between mastoparan and glycogen phosphorylase occurs in solution (5.Hirata Y. Atsumi M. Ohizumi Y. Nakahata N. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 81-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas binding to PLD2, like the interaction with heterotrimeric G-proteins, has only been observed for the membrane-bound protein (1.Chahdi A. Choi W.S. Kim Y.M. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12039-12045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22.Koch G. Mohr C. Just I. Aktories K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This investigation began with the question of whether mastoparan and GTP regulate the two main pools of PI4KIIα activity via a common G-protein-dependent mechanism. Our results indicated that activation of PI4KIIα by mastoparan occurs via both GTP-dependent and GTP-independent mechanisms in different membrane fractions. We also found that GTP-independent activation of PI4KIIα in buoyant membranes occurs directly. Finally we reveal for the first time that the PI4KIIα activity in buoyant membranes shows a striking dependence on cholesterol concentration. The results are discussed in terms of the role of rafting in the regulation of PI signaling. Materials—G-protein agonists, pertussis toxin, wortmannin, and mastoparans were purchased from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK). GDP, cGMP, and PI were bought from Sigma. Anti-PI4KII antiserum was prepared and purified as previously described by us (12.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Anderson J.S. Balinger A. Blumenkrantz D. Calnan D.P. Cramer R. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Anti-Gαi1/2 and anti-Gα0 were from Santa Cruz. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. PI4K Activity Assays—PI4K assays in the presence of endogenous and exogenous PI were performed as previously described (14.Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Tan S.K. Hsuan J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17115-17121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, all assays were carried out using endogenous PI as substrate. Reaction products were separated by thin layer chromatography and visualized on a Typhoon 9400 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative data were obtained within the linear range of the instrument using ImageQuant Software (Amersham Biosciences). Data analysis and curve fitting were performed using Prism 4 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Michaelis-Menten kinetic analyses were performed by non-linear regression curve-fitting using Prism software (GraphPad) and compared using the unpaired Student's t test where significance was attained at p < 0.05. For classical Michaelis-Menten kinetic analyses it is understood that both enzyme and substrate are freely diffusible. In this study, substrate PI is present in micellar form or membrane-bound and is not freely diffusible; hence the resultant Vmax and Km values presented here are strictly apparent values. Note that we have previously shown that these assays are linear for time points of up to 30 min (13.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Blumenkrantz D. Anderson J.S. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition we have shown that these assays reflect the intrinsic activity of the enzyme and do not reflect differences in endogenous substrate concentration between gradient fractions (13.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Blumenkrantz D. Anderson J.S. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out on equal volume aliquots from density gradient fractions. All mastoparan and guanine nucleotide additions were on isolated membrane fractions. For the 4C5G inhibition experiments the monoclonal antibody was used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. For Gi/0 inhibition, cells were incubated for 20 h with pertussis toxin at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. Subcellular Fractionation—A431 and HT1080 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 10% CO2. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Glutamax, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Separation of A431 and HT1080 cell post nuclear supernatants on a continuous 10–40% (w/v) sucrose gradient was performed as previously described (12.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Anderson J.S. Balinger A.

J. 2003; 376: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Gradient fractions were harvested from the top of the ultracentrifuge tube with the first and least dense fraction designated fraction number 1. Fractions 1–4 of the gradient contained cytosol, and fractions 7–12 contained membranous organelles. The distributions of organelle membranes were determined using Western blotting to identify a range of organelle marker proteins (12.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Anderson J.S. Balinger A. Blumenkrantz D.

Generation of HT1080 Cells Stably Transfected with GFP-PI4KIIα—HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells stably expressing human recombinant GFP-PI4KIIα were generated as follows. HT1080 cells were co-transfected with pEGFP-PI4KIIα (1 μg) and 0.2 μg of pZeoSV (Invitrogen) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). Two days after transfection, cells were split and replated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μg/ml Zeocin. Drug-resistant colonies (30–50) appeared within ∼7–10 days. Cells expressing GFP-tagged constructs were subsequently selected in two rounds of cell sorting using a FACSVantage SE (BD Biosciences) equipped with CellQuest software. Immunoprecipitation of PI4KIIα—Anti-PI4KIIα antiserum was prebound to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (GE Amersham Biosciences) and added to RIPA (0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4) solubilized raft membranes. Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in RIPA, followed by three washes in detergent-free PI4K assay buffer. The beads were then divided into equal aliquots and assayed for PI4K activity under various conditions using exogenous PI (50 μm) substrate. Cholesterol Depletion and Repletion Studies—Membrane fractions were treated for 20 min in the presence of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) to remove raft-associated cholesterol. Cholesterol loading was carried out by the addition of 2.5 mm cholesterol:MβCD complex at a ratio of 10:1 cholesterol:MβCD prepared as previously described (23.Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of PI4KIIα by Mastoparan and GTP—The distribution of PI4P synthesis using endogenous PI as substrate was examined in subcellular fractions prepared from A431 cells and separated as previously reported on a 10–40% continuous sucrose gradient (12.Waugh M.G.

Anderson J.S. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For the purposes of this study we concentrated on fractions 7–12 of the gradient, which contain all the PI4KII activity. As we reported previously, PI4KII activity was found to peak in the buoyant membrane fractions 8–10 (12.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Anderson J.S. Balinger A. Blumenkrantz D. Calnan D.P. Cramer R. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Blumenkrantz D. Anderson J.S. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which contain late endosomes, TGN and also a pool of activated PI4KIIα (12.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Anderson J.S. Balinger A.

J. 2003; 376: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To investigate whether or not mastoparan (Fig. 1A) could enhance PI4KII activity in the absence of G-protein activation, mastoparan (10 μm) was added to each membrane fraction in the absence of GTP. PI4K assays revealed that mastoparan elicited a highly reproducible 3–4-fold increase in PI4P generation in the more buoyant region of the gradient that contained activated PI4KIIα (Fig. 1, B and C) but had little effect on denser fractions that contained the bulk of the PI4KIIα and PI4KIIβ protein (12.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Anderson J.S. Balinger A. Blumenkrantz D. Calnan D.P. Cramer R. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Blumenkrantz D. Anderson J.S. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The M7 analogue of mastoparan (Fig. 1A) is a more potent activator of Gi/0-proteins (24.Klinker J.F. Hageluken A. Grunbaum L. Heilmann I. Nurnberg B. Harhammer R. Offermanns S. Schwaner I. Ervens J. Wenzel-Seifert K. et al.Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) but gave a similar amount of activation to mastoparan. In contrast to the clear enhancement of the peak of PI4K activity by mastoparan, the addition of GTPγS (100 μm) did not significantly affect the PI4K activity in this region of the gradient (Fig. 1C). However GTPγS did enhance PI4P generation in denser fractions, which contained secretory vesicles, plasma membrane, rough endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, and PI4KIIβ (12.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Anderson J.S. Balinger A. Blumenkrantz D. Calnan D.P. Cramer R. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Blumenkrantz D. Anderson J.S. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Compared with the mastoparan response, the stimulatory effect of GTPγS was found to be more variable (range 0.2–2-fold) and labile, as it was lost more rapidly on storage than the mastoparan responsiveness. Consequently, in response to the starting question concerning the mechanism by which PI4KIIα is regulated by mastoparan and GTP, these data indicate that different modes of regulation occur in different subcellular membranes. Activation of PI4KIIα in buoyant membranes by mastoparan in the absence of exogenous GTP suggested that the previously assumed mediators of PI4KII regulation by mastoparan, namely the Gi/0 heterotrimeric G-proteins (8.Gasman S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Hubert P. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16913-16920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 9.Panaretou C. Tooze S.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and Rho family small G-proteins (8.Gasman S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Hubert P. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16913-16920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), are not in fact required in these membranes. In contrast the stimulation of PI4KII activity by GTPγS in denser membranes indicated the presence of a G-protein-activated PI4KII activity in this region of the gradient, which was maintained in the presence of wortmannin (Fig. 1D). Unexpectedly however, co-addition of M7 and GTPγS gave rise to a level of PI4K activation in fraction 12 that was only equivalent to the sum of the responses observed when each reagent was added independently (Fig. 1D). The effects of M7 and GTPγS on PI4KII in fraction 12 did not therefore demonstrate the synergy expected for G-protein activation (16.Higashijima T. Uzu S. Nakajima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6491-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the inability of mastoparan to affect PI4KIIα in the dense membranes indicates that the peptide did not affect the endogenous PI, which is present in buoyant and dense membranes. Effect of Mg2+ Concentration—One concern at this stage was that the millimolar levels of Mg2+ used for the PI4K assay may have interfered with the mastoparan activation of G-proteins in the buoyant membranes, as work by Higashijima et al. (16.Higashijima T. Uzu S. Nakajima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6491-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had demonstrated that mastoparan-stimulation of GTP exchange for GDP on Gi/0 is inhibited by millimolar Mg2+. However in buffer containing 500 μm Mg2+, mastoparan, but not GTPγS, robustly stimulated PI4P synthesis (Fig. 2). Note that as these assays were carried out in the presence of wortmannin (5 μm), the observed stimulation by mastoparan was selective for PI4KII activity. Furthermore, in control experiments, we observed that the profile of PI4K activity across the gradient was unaffected when PI4K assays were carried out in the presence of 500 μm MgCl2, although the absolute levels of PI4P generation were reduced as would be expected (25.Husebye E.S. Flatmark T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 4149-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26.Pike M.C. Arndt C. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1967-1973PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Furthermore GDPβS, a potent G-protein antagonist did not affect mastoparan-dependent PI 4-kinase activity (Fig. 2), thereby confirming G-protein-independent activation in the buoyant fraction. Overexpression of PI4KIIα Leads to Increased Basal and Mastoparan-stimulated Activity—To verify that mastoparan was activating the PI4KIIα isozyme and not activating a secondary pool of the PI4KIIβ enzyme or inhibiting a PI4P phosphatase, we investigated the effect of increasing the expression this enzyme. HT1080-PI4KIIα cells stably expressed a GFP-PI4KIIα fusion protein and were chosen because they afforded a measurable increase in PI4KIIα expression without the disruption of the Golgi body 3S. Minogue, M. G. Waugh, M. A. De Matteis, D. J. Stephens, F. Berditchevski, and J. J. Hsuan, manuscript in preparation. that has been observed in other cells (11.Wang Y.J. Wang J. Sun H.Q. Martinez M.

Cell. 2003; 114: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) or any measurable change in Gαi levels as shown by Western blotting (Fig. 3A). The level of GFP-PI4KIIα in these cells was typically 2–4-fold higher than endogenous PI4KIIα as determined by Western blotting with anti-PI4KIIα antiserum (Fig. 3B). If mastoparan did activate PI4KIIα we expected to find increases in the control and mastoparan-stimulated activities. There was indeed an increase in the effects of mastoparan on the profile of PI4K activity in subcellular fractions obtained from these cells, and typically, HT1080-PI4KIIα cells had a 2–3-fold increase in the peak of PI4K activity relative to non-transfected cells. Furthermore, in line with our previous reports using different epithelial cell lines (12.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Anderson J.S. Balinger A. Blumenkrantz D. Calnan D.P. Cramer R. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13.Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Blumenkrantz D. Anderson J.S. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the peak of PI4K activity in this fibrosarcoma cell line was almost completely inhibited by the monoclonal antibody 4C5G but insensitive to wortmannin, thereby confirming the activity as PI4KII (Fig. 3C). As observed with A431 cells, addition of either mastoparan or its M7 analogue (10 μm) to membranes prepared from HT1080 or HT1080-PI4KIIα cells resulted in a similar 3–4-fold increase in the peak of PI4K activity (Fig. 3D). The observed changes in activity in response to mastoparan were therefore increased by PI4KIIα overexpression (Fig. 3E), thereby confirming that mastoparan and M7 stimulate PI4KIIα activity. Finally, as with the basal activity, the mastoparan response was inhibited by the 4C5G monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3F). Lack of Synergy between Mastoparan and Guanine Nucleotides—Although Gi/0-proteins have previously been reported to stimulate PI4K activity (8.Gasman S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Hubert P. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16913-16920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 9.Panaretou C. Tooze S.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), G-protein-independent activation by mastoparans was a novel finding. Subsequent experiments therefore focused on the effect of mastoparan on the buoyant, activated pool of PI4KIIα, which localizes to fractions enriched in late endosomal and TGN markers. We first returned to investigate more closely whether there was any evidence at all for synergy between mastoparan and guanine nucleotides by taking advantage of the higher activities observed with the HT1080-PI4KIIα cells. We found that addition of GTPγS (100 μm), GTP (100 μm), GDP (10 μm), or cGMP (10 μm) either on their own or in the presence of mastoparan had a slight inhibitory effect on PI4P generation by buoyant membranes (Fig. 4A). However the apparent inhibition by guanine nucleotides was found not to be statistically significant when assessed in further experiments. These results confirmed that neither GTP nor its metabolites are required for the observed stimulation of the PI4KII activity in buoyant membranes by mastoparan. Moreover, preincubation of cells with pertussis toxin had no apparent effect on the stimulation of PI4K activity by mastoparan in the buoyant membranes (Fig. 4B). However similar to heterotrimeric G-protein activation (19.Higashijima T. Burnier J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14176-14186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the M17 analogue (Fig. 1A) did not significantly enhance PI4K activity (Fig. 3F). Quantification: Mastoparan Dose Response and PI4KIIα Enzymatic Activity in Buoyant Membranes—Dose responses to both mastoparan and M7 were obtained for the PI4K activity in buoyant membranes prepared from HT1080-PI4KIIα cells (Fig. 4C). We found that mastoparan and M7 stimulated this PI4KIIα activity with EC50s of 12.9 ± 3.1 μm (n = 3) and 7.2 ± 4.1 μm (n = 3), respectively. The similar potencies of mastoparan and M7 observed in this study provide further evidence that these peptides do not stimulate PI4KIIα via Gi/0 activation. It is also important to note that mastoparan activates PI4KIIα at physiologically relevant concentrations that also activate secretion (27.Aridor M. Traub L.M. Sagi-Eisenberg R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). There were however some differences in the overall efficacies of mastoparan and M7 in stimulating P"

PTOX and AOX are diiron carboxylate proteins, and based on crystal structures of other members of this protein class, a structural model of PTOX has been proposed in which the ligation sphere of the diiron center is composed of six conserved histidine and glutamate residues. We tested the functional significance of these residues by site-directed mutagenesis of PTOX in vitro and in planta, taking advantage null immutans alleles for the latter studies.

We also examined the significance of a conserved sequence in (or near) the PTOX active site that corresponds precisely to Exon 8 of the IM gene. In vitro and in planta mutagenesis revealed that conserved amino acids within this domain can be altered but that deletion of all or part of the domain abolishes activity. Because protein accumulates normally in the deletion mutants, the data suggest that the conformation of the Exon 8 sequence is important for PTOX activity. An allele of immutans (designated 3639) was identified that lacks the Exon 8 sequence; it does not accumulate PTOX protein.

AOX is a ubiquinol oxidase that catalyzes the four-electron reduction of oxygen to water and branches from the cytochrome pathway at the quinone pool (3Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Annu. Rev.

AOX is found in all plants and in some fungi and protozoa, and it is thought to provide an overflow for carbon metabolism (3Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Under stress conditions it might also play a role in minimizing the production of reactive oxygen species from electron transport (5Affourtit C. Albury M.S. Crichton P.G. Moore A.L.

IMMUTANS gene immutans mutant 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid n-propyl gallate. Plants that lack IMMUTANS are variegated. Whereas cells in the green sectors of immutans (im) plants have normal-appearing chloroplasts, cells in the white sectors have vacuolated plastids that lack pigments and internal membrane structures. The white im sectors accumulate phytoene, a colorless C40 intermediate in carotenoid biosynthesis (10Wetzel C.M. Jiang C.-Z. Meehan L.J. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S.R. Plant J. 1994; 6: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This indicates that im is impaired in the activity of phytoene desaturase, which converts phytoene to ζ-carotene. Because of its resemblance to AOX, it was early hypothesized that IM is a plastid quinol oxidase that functions as a redox component in phytoene desaturation. According to this hypothesis, electrons are transferred from phytoene to plastoquinone (via phytoene desaturase) and then from plastoquinone to oxygen (via IM) (1Wu D. Wright D.A. Wetzel C. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 2Carol P. Stevenson D. Bisanz C. Breitenbach J. Sandmann G. Mache R. Coupland G. Kuntz M. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). It was further suggested that a lack of IM (as in im) results in overreduction of the plastoquinone pool and that this is responsible for the build-up of phytoene in the membranes. As a consequence, the production of downstream, photoprotective (colored) carotenoids would be impaired, and under high light illumination conditions, photooxidized plastids would be generated. These would give rise to white cells and sectors as the leaf develops. In support of this hypothesis, IM has quinol oxidase activity in vitro and in vivo (11Cournac L. Josse E. Joët T. Rumeau D.

Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea that IM plays an important role in plastid metabolism, the differentiation of many plastid and tissue types is impaired in im (15Aluru M. Bae H. Wu D. Rodermel S.

In support of this notion, evidence has accumulated that IM is the elusive terminal oxidase of chlororespiration (and hence is frequently designated “PTOX,” for plastid terminal oxidase) (11Cournac L.

In addition, IM has been implicated as an important component in the arsenal of plastid responses to oxidative stress, likely as a “safety valve” for the dissipation of excess electron flow (17Rizhsky L.

Huner, unpublished data. Our current working hypothesis is that IM is a versatile alternative electron sink in plastid membranes and that it lies at the intersection of many redox pathways. Sequence comparisons have revealed that AOX and PTOX are non-heme diiron carboxylate proteins (21Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 22Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Morre A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Andersson M.E.

By analogy to crystal structure determinations of non-plant members of this protein class, it has been proposed that the diiron centers of AOX and PTOX are coordinated by four carboxylate and two histidine residues on a four helix bundle (Fig. 1, A and 1B) (23Andersson M.E.

Support for this model has come from EPR spectroscopy of AOX, as well as from mutagenesis of five of the six proposed iron ligands of AOX using prokaryotic model systems to test function (such as a heme-deficient Escherichia coli strain) (3Vanlerberghe G.C.

In addition to the four alpha helices that bear the active site, AOX and PTOX have a fifth, smaller α-helix. This helix and part of helix 1 are thought to be embedded in the membrane but not span it, i.e. AOX and PTOX are modeled as interfacial membrane proteins (Fig. 1B) (23Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 24Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys.

The proposition that the structure of PTOX is similar to that of AOX is based on a single sequence, IM from A. thaliana (1Wu D. Wright D.A. Wetzel C. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 2Carol P. Stevenson D. Bisanz C. Breitenbach J. Sandmann G. Mache R. Coupland G. Kuntz M. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The first purpose of this paper was to test the universality of the Berthold/Andersson/Nordlund model of PTOX (24Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), given the diversity of PTOX sequences that have become available since the model was proposed. These studies revealed that 1) the six iron ligands are perfectly conserved in PTOX from diverse sources; and 2) nearly all PTOX enzymes have a conserved 16 amino acid sequence that is not present in AOX, and which corresponds precisely to Exon 8 of the higher plant gene. Thus, the second purpose of this paper was to examine the functional significance of the putative iron ligands and Exon 8 sequences both in vitro and in planta. The in planta experiments were made possible by the availability of null im alleles of Arabidopsis and by the ability to obtain fully viable transgenic im plants that bear constructs containing mutated IM genes. Finally, we identified an Arabidopsis im allele that lacks Exon 8 and used this mutant as a tool to further assess the importance of the Exon 8 sequence for PTOX structure and function. Plant Strains—Strain 3639 is an uncharacterized A. thaliana variegation mutant from the Arabidopis Biological Resource Center (Ohio State University). It is light-sensitive and was maintained under conditions previously described for other light-sensitive Arabidopsis variegations (10Wetzel C.M. Jiang C.-Z. Meehan L.J. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S.R. Plant J. 1994; 6: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The spotty allele of im (10Wetzel C.M. Jiang C.-Z. Meehan L.J. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S.R. Plant J. 1994; 6: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and 3639 were used in this report; both are in the Columbia background. Wild type Columbia seedlings served as “wild type” controls. In Vitro Site-directed Mutagenesis—A full-length IM cDNA has previously been isolated in our laboratory (1Wu D. Wright D.A. Wetzel C. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). A truncated version of this cDNA that lacks the chloroplast transit peptide sequence was generated by PCR amplification, and the resulting sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The truncated cDNA was cloned into the BamHI and NheI sites of pET-11a (Novagen, Madison, WI), and the QuikChange™ Site-Directed Mutagenesis protocol was used to generate mutations (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Instructions provided by the manufacturer were followed, except for deletion mutations, where a 48 °C annealing temperature was used instead of 55 °C. All the mutated sequences were confirmed by sequencing. Following standard notation, the mutant clones are designated by the amino acid that was altered, its location in the A. thaliana IM sequence, and the amino acid to which it was changed (e.g. H299A: His299 was changed to Ala). The primers listed in TABLES ONE and TWO were used to produce mutations in the iron-binding sites of IM and in the Exon 8 sequence. DEX8 is a deletion of the entire Exon 8 sequence, while D1–8 and D9–16 are deletions of the first eight or last eight amino acids of Exon 8.TABLE ONEPrimers for the introduction of mutations in the six putative iron-binding sitesMutationPrimer sequencesE136A5′-gcaaggttctttgttcttgcgacaattgctagagtgcc-3′5′-ggcactctagcaattgtcgcaagaacaaagaaccttgc-3′E136D5′-gcaaggttctttgttcttgacacaattgctagagtgcc-3′5′-ggcactctagcaattgtgtcaagaacaaagaaccttgc-3′E136H5′-gcaaggttctttgttcttcacacaattgctagagtgcc-3′5′-ggcactctagcaattgtgtgaagaacaaagaaccttgc-3′E175A5′-cactttgctgagagctggaatgcaatgcatcacttgctc-3′5′-gagcaagtgatgcattgcattccagctctcagcaaagtg-3′E175D5′-cactttgctgagagctggaatgatatgcatcacttgctc-3′5′-gagcaagtgatgcatatcattccagctctcagcaaagtg-3′E175H5′-cactttgctgagagctggaatcatatgcatcacttgctc-3′5′-gagcaagtgatgcatatgattccagctctcagcaaagtg-3′H177A5′-gctgagagctggaatgaaatggctcacttgctcataatg-3′5′-cattatgagcaagtgagccatttcattccagctctcagc-3′H178A5′-gctgagagctggaatgaaatgcatgccttgctcataatg-3′5′-cattatgagcaaggcatgcatttcattccagctctcagc-3′H178E5′-gctgagagctggaatgaaatgcatgagttgctcataatg-3′5′-cattatgagcaactcatgcatttcattccagctctcagc-3′H178N5′-gctgagagctggaatgaaatgcataacttgctcataatg-3′5′-cattatgagcaagttatgcatttcattccagctctcagc-3′E227A5′-cacttttcggaatgtgtggcgagtcatgcatatgag-3′5′-ctcatatgcatgactcgccacacattccgaaaagtg-3′E227D5′-cacttttcggaatgtgtggacagtcatgcatatgag-3′5′-ctcatatgcatgactgtccacacattccgaaaagtg-3′E227H5′-cacttttcggaatgtgtgcacagtcatgcatatgag-3′5′-ctcatatgcatgactgtgcacacattccgaaaagtg-3′E296A5′-gtgaacataagagatgatgcagcagaacactgcaag-3′5′-cttgcagtgttctgctgcatcatctcttatgttcac-3′E296D5′-gtgaacataagagatgatgatgcagaacactgcaag-3′5′-cttgcagtgttctgcatcatcatctcttatgttcac-3′E296H5′-gtgaacataagagatgatcatgcagaacactgcaag-3′5′-cttgcagtgttctgcatgatcatctcttatgttcac-3′E298A5′-gatgatgaagcagcacactgcaagacaatgagagcttgtcag-3′5′-ctgacaagctctcattgtcttgcagtgtgctgcttcatcatc-3′H299A5′-gatgatgaagcagaagcctgcaagacaatgagagcttgtcag-3′5′-ctgacaagctctcattgtcttgcaggcttctgcttcatcatc-3′H299E5′-gatgatgaagcagaagagtgcaagacaatgagagcttgtcag-3′5′-ctgacaagctctcattgtcttgcactcttctgcttcatcatc-3′H299N5′-gatgatgaagcagaaaactgcaagacaatgagagcttgtcag-3′5′-ctgacaagctctcattgtcttgcagttttctgcttcatcatc-3′ Open table in a new tab TABLE TWOPrimers for the generation of mutations in the Exon 8 sequenceMutationPrimer sequencesDEX85′-gggaggtgacttgtacttatttgaaaatctatacgatgtgtttg-3′5′-caaacacatcgtatagatttcaaataagtacaagtcacctccc-3′D1-85′-ggtgacttgtacttatttcccaatactcgaagaccag-3′5′-ctggtcttcgaggattgggaaataagtacaagtatcc-3′D9-165′-gagttccaaacatcaagaactgaaaatctatacgatgtg-3′5′-cacatcgtatagattttcagttcttgatgtttggaactc-3′D267A5′-gacttctacttatttgctgagttccaaac-3′5′-gtttggaactcagcaaataagtacaagtc-3′E268A5′-gtacttatttgatgcgttccaaacatc-3′5′-gatgtttggaacgcatcaaataagtac-3′E269A5′-gtacttatttgatgaggcccaaacatcaag-3′5′-cttgatgtttgggcctcatcaaataagtac-3′Q270A5′-cttatttgatgagttcgcaacatcaagaac-3′5′-gttcttgatgttgcgaactcatcaaataag-3′T271A5′-gatgagttccaagcatcaagaactccc-3′5′-gggagttcttgatgcttggaactcatc-3′R278A5′-ctcccaatactgcaagaccagtaatag-3′5′-ctattactggtcttgcagtattgggag-3′R279A5′-cccaatactagggcaccagtaatag-3′5′-ctattactggtgcccgagtattggg-3′P280A5′-cccaatactcgaagagcagtaatagaaaatc-3′5′-gattttctattactgctcttcgagtattggg-3′ Open table in a new tab Site-directed Mutagensis in Planta—For in planta mutagenesis experiments, mutations were generated using the same procedures and primers described above for the in vitro experiments, except that the full-length IM cDNA was used (to assure proper chloroplast targeting) (1Wu D. Wright D.A. Wetzel C. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The mutant cDNAs were cloned behind the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter in the binary vector pBI121, and the constructs were transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens; the floral dip method (31Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to transform im plants (spotty allele). Kanamycin-resistant seedlings were selected at the T1 generation on plates containing 1× Murashige-Skoog salts (pH 5.7), 1% sucrose and 50 μg ml–1 kanamycin. PCR and Southern Blotting methods were used to verify that the plants were transformed. Phenotypic analyses were performed on T2 generation plants. In Vitro PTOX Activity Assays—PTOX activity assays were conducted in vitro using procedures described by Josse et al. (12Josse E-M. Simkin A. Gaffé J. Labouré A-M. Kuntz M. Carol P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Josse E-M. Alcaraz J.-P. Labouré A-M. Kuntz M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3787-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In brief, the mutant constructs were transformed into E. coli strain BL21-DE3, and the cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin until they reached an A600 of 0.6. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1.6 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration). After 2 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended on ice in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.3% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The resuspension was sonicated briefly and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was then centrifuged in a Beckman L8–70W ultracentrifuge (200,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C), and the membrane pellet was resuspended in a solution containing 0.75 m sucrose, 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The concentration of proteins in the pellet was measured using the Bio-Rad protocol with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Oxygen consumption was monitored with a Clark O2 electrode (Hansatech, Norfolk, England). Assays were conducted at 25 °C with 100–200 μg of membrane protein in a 1.5-ml reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris maleate (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm decyl-plastoquinone (2,3-methyl-5-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone, from Sigma). The reactions were initiated by the addition of NADH (1 mm final concentration) followed by KCN (3 mm final concentration) and n-propyl gallate (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid-n-propyl ester) (0.5 mm final concentration), all available from Sigma. Detection of RNA and Protein—Procedures for total cell RNA isolation and Northern blotting have been described (32Chen M. Choi Y.D. Voytas D. Rodermel S. Plant J. 2000; 2: 303-313Crossref Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose filters were probed with labeled IM sequences, and RNAs were visualized by phosphorimaging analysis. E. coli proteins were isolated as described above. To isolate partially purified chloroplasts, green leaf tissues were collected from Arabidopsis seedlings (3–4 weeks old) and homogenized in a Waring blender in the cold in a solution containing 0.33 m sorbitol, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0). The homogenate was filtered through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and centrifuged at 2,600 × g for 5 min. The pellet was washed with 10 mm MOPS (pH 8.0). Following centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min), the pellet was resuspended in 0.33 m sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0). Chlorophyll concentrations were measured on the resuspended membranes as outlined previously (32Chen M. Choi Y.D. Voytas D. Rodermel S. Plant J. 2000; 2: 303-313Crossref Google Scholar). Procedures for Western blotting have been described (32Chen M. Choi Y.D. Voytas D. Rodermel S. Plant J. 2000; 2: 303-313Crossref Google Scholar). In brief, equal amounts of chlorophyll (5 μg) were electrophoresed through 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was incubated with a polyclonal antibody generated to the Arabidopsis IM protein (1:3,000 dilution) (17Rizhsky L. Hallak-Herr E. Van Breusegem F. Rachmilevitch S. Barr J.E. Rodermel S. Inzé D. Mittler R. Plant J. 2002; 32: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and the proteins were visualized using the ECL immunodetection procedure (Pierce, Erembodegum, Belgium). Protein Import Assays—An IM cDNA containing the entire coding sequence and an IM cDNA in which Exon 8 was deleted (DEX8) (see above) were cloned into the BamHI and NheI sites of pET-11a. These two constructs were used as DNA templates to carry out in vitro transcription and translation with the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). A standard reaction mixture of 50 μl contained 40 μl of TNT Quick Master, 20 μCi of [35S]methionine, and 1 μg of template DNA. The import assays were conducted with intact pea chloroplasts using established methods (32Chen M. Choi Y.D. Voytas D. Rodermel S. Plant J. 2000; 2: 303-313Crossref Google Scholar, 33Perry S.E. Li H.-M. Keegstra K. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34Rensink W.A. Pilon M. Weisbeek P. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In brief, leaf tissues from pea seedlings (10–15 days-old) were homogenized in a blender (in the cold) in GR buffer: 0.33 m sorbitol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.5g/liter bovine serum albumin, 5 mm ascorbate, and 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0). The homogenate was filtered through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem) and centrifuged 5 min at 2,600 × g. The resulting crude chloroplast pellet was resuspended in GR buffer, then loaded onto a Percoll gradient. After centrifuging 10 min at 10,500 × g, intact chloroplasts were removed and washed twice in a buffer containing 0.33 m sorbitol and 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0). A standard import reaction of 500 μl contained 330 mm sorbitol, 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaHCO3, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.2 mg antipain (Sigma), 5 mm ATP and 40 μl of 35S-labeled IM transcription/translation products. The import assay was initiated by adding chloroplasts (corresponding to 200 μg of chlorophyll). The preparations were maintained at 25 °C in the light. After 30 min, most of the label had been incorporated into the chloroplasts. The fate of the labeled IM protein was monitored for up to 3 h. Mutagenesis of Putative Iron-binding Ligands in Vitro—Berthold and colleagues have proposed that the structure of PTOX is similar to that of AOX (Fig. 1) (24Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is based on several dozen AOX sequences, but a single PTOX sequence, IM from Arabidopsis (1Wu D. Wright D.A. Wetzel C. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 2Carol P. Stevenson D. Bisanz C. Breitenbach J. Sandmann G. Mache R. Coupland G. Kuntz M. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). As a first approach to test the validity of this model, we compared PTOX sequences that have become available since the model was proposed. Fig. 1C shows the phylogenetic relatedness of five higher plant, two green algal and five cyanobacterial sequences, using Arabidopsis AOX1a as an outgroup. The long branch length indicates that AOX is distantly related to PTOX, as reported previously (1Wu D. Wright D.A. Wetzel C. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The higher plant PTOX enzymes form a distinct clade that can be separated into monocot (rice and wheat) and dicot (Arabidopsis, pepper, and tomato) proteins. The green algal sequences (Bigelowiella and Chlamydomonas) also cluster together. Sequence analyses of completed genomes and/or molecular hybridization experiments have revealed that PTOX is a single copy gene in Arabidopsis, tomato, and rice (1Wu D. Wright D.A. Wetzel C. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 12Josse E-M. Simkin A. Gaffé J. Labouré A-M. Kuntz M. Carol P.

Genet. 2003; 107: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that PTOX proteins, regardless of source, resemble Arabidopsis IM in that their active sites are contained within a four helix bundle. They also have a fifth, shorter α-helix that likely anchors PTOX in the plastid membrane (24Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We also found that all PTOX enzymes have six perfectly conserved amino acids that could potentially function as iron-binding ligands. These residues are glutamate and histidine; in both PTOX and AOX there are two perfectly conserved EXXH sequences and two perfectly conserved glutamates in the active site region (Fig. 1A). Taken together, these data support the Berthold/Andersson/Nordlund model of PTOX (24Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). As a first approach to test the functional significance of the six putative iron"

Hence, a better understanding of the molecular basis ensuring appropriate mimicry is required in order to design efficient carbohydrate mimic-based vaccines. This study focuses on the following two unrelated sets of mimics of the Shigella flexneri 5a O-specific polysaccharide (O-SP): (i) a synthetic branched pentasaccharide known to mimic the average solution conformation of S. flexneri 5a O-SP, and (ii) three nonapeptides selected upon screening of phage-displayed peptide libraries with two protective murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of the A isotype specific for S. flexneri 5a O-SP. By inducing anti-O-SP antibodies upon immunization in mice when appropriately presented to the immune system, the pentasaccharide and peptides p100c and p115, but not peptide p22, were qualified as mimotopes of the native antigen. NMR studies based on transferred NOE (trNOE) experiments revealed that both kinds of mimotopes had an average conformation when bound to the mAbs that was close to that of their free form. Most interestingly, saturation transfer difference (STD) experiments showed that the characteristic turn conformations adopted by the major conformers of p100c and p115, as well as of p22, are clearly involved in mAb binding. These latter experiments also showed that the branched glucose residue of the pentasaccharide was a key part of the determinant recognized by the protective mAbs. Finally, by using NMR-derived pentasaccharide and peptide conformations coupled to STD information, models of antigen-antibody interaction were obtained. Most interestingly, only one model was found compatible with experimental data when large O-SP fragments were docked into one of the mIgA-binding sites.

Hodges R.G. Heidelberg M. Bernhard W.G. J. Exp. Med. 1945; 82: 445-465Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Several polysaccharide vaccines such as those targeting Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, or Salmonella typhi were proven efficient in adults and are thus commercially available. Their ineffectiveness in infants has been successfully circumvented with the licensing of polysaccharide:protein conjugates such as those targeting Haemophilus influenzae b, S. pneumoniae, and N. meningitidis group C infections (2Roy R. Drug Discovery Today: Technologies. 2004; 1: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A possible alternative may derive from the use of accurate synthetic mimics of the bacterial polysaccharide antigens. This innovative approach has been mostly developed along two lines, including the use of either synthetic oligosaccharides or peptides mimicking the carbohydrate determinants recognized by anti-carbohydrate monoclonal antibodies (mAb) conferring protection in experimental models of infection. Indeed, semi-synthetic glycoconjugates incorporating oligosaccharides mimicking fragments of bacterial polysaccharide antigens were shown to be highly immunogenic in mice (3Goebel H.H. Ikeda K.

The “proof of concept” was recently demonstrated in humans with the efficacy of such a semi-synthetic glycoconjugate in protecting against H. influenzae b infection (6Verez-Bencomo V. Fernandez-Santana V. Hardy E. Toledo M.E. Rodriguez M.C. Heynngnezz L. Rodriguez A. Baly A. Herrera L. Izquierdo M. Villar A. Valdes Y. Cosme K. Deler M.L. Montane M. Garcia E. Ramos A. Aguilar A.

However, access to the required carbohydrate haptens is often a roadblock. Therefore, besides the investigation of anti-idiotype antibody (7Stein H. Gatter K.C. Heryet A. Mason D.Y. Lancet. 1984; 2: 71-73Abstract PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), expanding the concept of mimicry led in the recent past to extensive exploring of the potential mimicking of polysaccharide and/or complex oligosaccharide antigens by peptides (8Pirofski L.A.

Trends Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These peptide mimotopes, i.e. peptide mimics inducing an anti-carbohydrate antibody response upon immunization, have been proposed as potential surrogate antigens of carbohydrates in vaccine development (10Monzavi-Karbassi B. Cunto-Amesty G. Luo P. Kieber-Emmons T. Trends Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Indeed, because of their ease of manufacture and their intrinsic immunogenic properties, peptide mimotopes may have greater advantage over complex carbohydrate haptens issued from bacterial cell cultures or low yielding multistep syntheses. However, not all peptide mimics of carbohydrate antigens behave as mimotopes. Despite the large number of known peptide mimics, only few peptide mimotope-based experimental vaccines have been reported so far (11Luo P. Agadjanyan M. Qiu J. Westerink M.A. Steplewski Z.

It is believed that a better understanding of the molecular basis of peptide-carbohydrate mimicry could help the rational design of potent peptide mimotope-based vaccines. In particular, whether mimicry is structural, functional, or both remains an unsolved question (9Johnson M.A. Rotondo A. Pinto B.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2149-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Harris S.L. Craig L. Mehroke J.S. Rashed M. Zwick M.B. Kenar K. Toone E.J. Greenspan N. Auzanneau F.I.

Available x-ray data of carbohydrate-protein and of the corresponding peptide mimotope-protein complexes along with information on the thermodynamics of peptide mimic-protein binding are somewhat scarce (17Harris S.L. Craig L. Mehroke J.S. Rashed M. Zwick M.B. Kenar K. Toone E.J. Greenspan N. Auzanneau F.I. Marino-Albernas J.R. Pinto B.M. Scott J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus to date, although analysis of the topography of ligand-receptor complementarity may be performed by a variety of methods, available knowledge on the molecular features of peptide-carbohydrate mimicry mostly relies on data obtained from NMR and molecular modeling studies as reviewed recently (22Johnson M.A. Pinto B.M. Carbohydr. Res. 2004; 339: 907-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). By aiming to prevent S. flexneri bacterial infections, during the past few years we investigated the development of synthetic mimics of the major protective S. flexneri antigen. S. flexneri, a Gram-negative bacillus, is responsible for the endemic form of shigellosis, a human dysenteric syndrome causing a high mortality rate in infants, particularly in developing countries (23Kotloff K.L. Winickoff J.P. Ivanoff B. Clemens J.D. Swerdlow D.L. Sansonetti P.J. Adak G.K. Levine M.M. Bull. W.H.O. 1999; 77: 651-666PubMed Google Scholar). The disease, characterized by bacterial invasion of the human colonic mucosa, leads to acute inflammation and subsequent massive tissue destruction (24Phalipon A. Sansonetti P.J. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 23: 371-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Protection induced upon infection is serotype-specific (24Phalipon A. Sansonetti P.J. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 23: 371-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), pointing to the O-specific polysaccharide moiety (O-SP) of the bacterial LPS as the major target for protective immunity. In line with the success of the CPS-protein conjugate vaccines, protein conjugates of detoxified S. flexneri 2a LPS, the prevalent serotype in humans, were shown to be safe and immunogenic both in adults and young children (25Ashkenazi S. Passwell J.H. Harlev E. Miron D. Dagan R. Farzan N. Ramon R. Majadly F. Bryla D.A. Karpas A.B. Robbins J.B. Schneerson R. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: 1565-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). More recently, we developed fully synthetic glycoconjugates as well as promising neoglycoproteins exposing well designed synthetic saccharidic haptens mimicking S. flexneri 2a O-SP as potential vaccines against the homologous infection (26Wright K. Guerreiro C. Laurent I. Baleux F. Mulard L.A. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2004; 2: 1518-1527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Belot F. Guerreiro C. Baleux F. Mulard L.A. Chemistry. 2005; 11: 1625-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 3Phalipon, A., Costachel, C., Grandjean, C., Thuizat, A., Guerreiro, C., Tanguy, M., Nato, F., Vulliez-Le Normand, B., Bélot, F., Wright, K., Marcel-Peyre, V., Snsonetti, P. J., and Mulard, L. (2005) J. Immunol., in press. Alternatively, we also investigated the potential of peptide mimotopes, and we reported the first example of immunogenic mimicry of carbohydrates by peptides identified by screening of phage-displayed nonapeptide libraries with two protective mAbs of the A isotype (mIgA) specific for S. flexneri serotype 5a, mIgA C5, and mIgA I3 (28Phalipon A. Folgori A. Arondel J. Sgaramella G. Fortugno P. Cortese R. Sansonetti P.J. Felici F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2620-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Among the 19 peptide sequences selected upon screening with mIgA I3, p100c (YKPLGALTH) and p115 (KVPPWARTA, also interacting with mIgA C5) only induce anti-O-SP antibodies in mice upon immunization with the corresponding phage particles. Most interestingly, the mimotopes share no obvious consensus sequence and do not cross-react with one another. However, as often reported by others (29Pincus S.H. Lepage S.R. Jung R.F. Massey J.G. Jaseja M. Int. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 20: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 30Prinz D.M. Smithson S.L. Westerink M.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2004; 285: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), their amino acid sequences contain aromatic and hydrophobic residues but also amino acids having cyclic side chains, including at least one proline. Besides, based on a combination of NMR and molecular modeling studies, we proposed a conformational model for the S. flexneri 5a O-SP whose biological repeating unit is the branched pentasaccharide I (Structure 1) (31Lindberg A.A. Cam P.D. Chan N. Phu L.K. Trach D.D. Lindberg G. Karlsson K. Karnell A. Ekwall E. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1991; 13: 231-237Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Study of both the antigenicity and the conformation of the four synthetic frame-shifted pentasaccharides corresponding to pentasaccharide I (32Mulard L.A. Ughetto-Monfrin J. J. Carbohydr. Chem. 2000; 19: 193-220Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) suggested that the DA(E)BC sequence is the structure that best mimics the native O-SP antigen (33Clement M.J. Imberty A. Phalipon A. Perez S. Simenel C. Mulard L.A. Delepierre M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47928-47936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). More recently, the pentasaccharide DA(E)BC was shown to act as a mimotope. 4L. Mulard and A. Phalipon, unpublished results. Here we report the antigenicity and the NMR findings on the preferred conformation of p100c and p115 peptide mimotopes both in their free and mIgA-bound forms. Analysis was also performed using peptide p22 (KRHFLSQRQ, mIgA C5- and mIgA I3-specific), one of the 17 nonimmunogenic peptides selected during the original screening (28Phalipon A. Folgori A. Arondel J. Sgaramella G. Fortugno P. Cortese R. Sansonetti P.J. Felici F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2620-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Antibody-bound conformations and epitope mapping were derived from transferred NOE (trNOE) (34Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 402-417Google Scholar, 35Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 423-442Google Scholar) and saturation transfer difference (STD) experiments (36Mayer M. Meyer B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar), respectively. The conformational preferences observed for the peptides were tentatively related to those derived from NMR and molecular modeling analysis of the DA(E)BC-mIgA complexes that led to a theoretical model of the recognition of S. flexneri 5a O-SP by mIgA I3. This contribution adds to the few reports investigating molecular mimicry by analyzing both peptide mimic-mAb and carbohydrate-mAb recognition features (37Johnson M.A. Pinto B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 15368-15374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 38Johnson M.A. Jaseja M. Zou W. Jennings H.J. Copie V. Pinto B.M. Pincus S.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 12: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Material—Selected nonapeptides p100c (YKPLGALTH), p115 (KVPPWARTA), and p22 (KRHFLSQRQ) were purchased from Synthem (Saint-Christol-Les-Alès, France). The peptide p100c was further cyclized in the Unité de Chimie Organique at the Pasteur Institute. Pentasaccharide DA(E)BC was used in its methyl glycoside form DA(E)BC-OMe (40Mulard L.A. Clément M.-J. Segat-Dioury F. Delepierre M. Tetrahedron. 2002; 58: 2593-2604Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). mAb mIgA C5 and mIgA I3 were prepared as described previously (41Phalipon A. Kaufmann M. Michetti P. Cavaillon J.M. Huerre M. Sansonetti P. Kraehenbuhl J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Inhibition ELISA—Characterization of the oligosaccharide determinant recognized by the mIgA was performed by measuring the mIgA-oligosaccharide interaction as follows. First of all, a standard curve was established for each mIgA tested. Different concentrations of the mAb were incubated overnight at 4 °C on microtiter plates coated with purified S. flexneri 5a LPS at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and subsequently incubated with 1% PBS/BSA for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with PBS/Tween 20 (0.05%), alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgA was added at a dilution of 1:5,000 (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS/Tween 20 (0.05%), the substrate was added (12 mg of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 1.2 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.8, and 10.8 ml of 5 m NaCl). Once the color developed, the plate was read at 405 nm (Dynatech MR 4000 microplate reader). A standard curve A = f([Ab]) was fitted to the quadratic equation Y = aX2 + bX + c, where Y is the absorbance and X is the Ab concentration. Correlation factor (r2) of 0.99 was routinely obtained. Then the amount of oligosaccharides giving 50% inhibition of mIgA binding to LPS (IC50) was determined as follows. Each mIgA at a given concentration (chosen as the minimal concentration of Ab which gives the maximal absorbance on the standard curve) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with various concentrations of each of the oligosaccharides to be tested, in 1% PBS/BSA. Measurement of unbound mIgA was performed as described above using microtiter plates coated with purified LPS from S. flexneri 5a, and the mAb concentration was deduced from the standard curve. The recognition capacity of anti-LPS mIgA for LPS was determined as described above using various concentrations of LPS that were incubated in solution overnight at 4 °C with the predefined concentration of each mIgA. IC50 was defined as the concentration of oligosaccharides required to inhibit 50% of mIgA binding to LPS. NMR Spectroscopy—All 1H NMR experiments were recorded at 298 K on a Varian Unity Inova spectrometer operating at 1H frequencies of 500 MHz. 1H chemical shifts were given relative to an external standard of 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane sodium sulfonate at 0 ppm. Free Peptides—The samples were prepared in 90% H2O and 10% D2O at pH 5 for p115 and p100c and at pH 6.5 for p22. The solution concentrations were about 10, 3, and 8 mm for p115, p100c, and p22, respectively. DQF-COSY (42Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar), TOCSY (43Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1198) Google Scholar), and ROESY (44Kessler H. Griesinger C. Kerssebaum R. Wagner K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 607-609Crossref Scopus (421) Google Scholar) experiments were recorded with 512 increments and 16 scans at 298 K. The TOCSY and ROESY experiments were acquired using a mixing time of 80 and 400 ms, respectively. Water suppression was performed using the WATERGATE pulse sequence (45Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar). All NMR spectra were collected in the phase-sensitive mode using the States-Haberkorn method (46States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). Ligand-Antibody Interactions—Shigemi tubes were used for all samples. In order to prepare NMR samples of pentasaccharide DA(E)BC-OMe in the presence of the antibodies mIgA C5 and mIgA I3, mAbs were concentrated after repeated cycles of exchange with D2O buffer (50 mm deuterated sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) in Amicon Centriprep-10 concentrators. trNOE experiments (34Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 402-417Google Scholar, 35Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 423-442Google Scholar, 47Jimenez-Barbero J. Peters T. NMR Spectroscopy of Glycoconjugates. Wiley-VCH, New York2002: 289-307Crossref Google Scholar) performed on different pentasaccharide:binding site ratios (5:1, 10:1, 15:1, 20:1, and 30:1) showed that the most favorable ratio for trNOE was 20:1. So the final samples were prepared with 3.75 μm antibody and 0.3 mm pentasaccharide in 380 μl of the above mentioned D2O buffer. trNOE, trROE, and STD experiments (36Mayer M. Meyer B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) on pentasaccharide DA(E)BC-OMe in the presence of mIgA C5 and mIgA I3 were recorded at 500 and 600 MHz, respectively. trNOE experiments were performed with mixing times of 100, 150, 250, 300, and 400 ms at 303 K to obtain build-up curves and trROE with a mixing time of 400 ms. The conformation of the free peptides was studied at pH 5. However, with this pH value being close to the isoelectric points of the mIgAs, a study of peptides in their bound conformation was performed at pH 6.5 to avoid precipitation of the mAb. Similarly to the DA(E)BC-mIgA complexes, a peptide:antibody-binding site ratio of 20:1 was used (0.3 mm:3.75 μm). trNOE experiments were performed with mixing times of 100, 150, 250, 300, and 400 ms. To be sure that the observed negative cross-peaks were real trNOEs, NOESY spectra were recorded under the same pH, temperature, and concentration values with the peptides alone. Furthermore, to discard any impact on NOE effects of viscosity increase as a result of the mAb presence, a NOESY spectrum (τm = 200 ms) of p115 was registered in the presence of BSA at the same concentration ratio as that used with the mIgAs. Because no negative NOE cross-peaks were observed in either case, it was assumed that the negative NOEs observed in the presence of mIgA were trNOEs. Selective saturation of antibody resonances were performed for all STD-NMR experiments at 0.3 ppm (30 ppm for reference spectra) using a series of 40 gaussian-shaped pulses (50- and 10-ms delay between pulses, excitation width γB1/2π, approximately 50 Hz) for a total saturation time of 2.4 s. The one-dimensional STD spectra were recorded with 4096 scans at 288 and 298 K for the pentasaccharide and the peptides, respectively. Subtraction of saturated spectra from reference spectra was obtained by phase cycling (36Mayer M. Meyer B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). For DA(E)BC-OMe, two STD-TOCSY experiments (48Herfurth L. Weimar T. Peters T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 2097-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were recorded with selective saturation at 0.3 and 30 ppm, respectively. Differences between the two spectra were performed using the VNMR software. No attempt here was made to quantify STD-NMR intensities, as it is known that these exhibit a complex dependence on relaxation times, correlation times, exchange rates, and on binding site proton density. Indeed, only when short saturation times are used, i.e. less than 1 s, can intensities reflect ligand proton-protein proton distances (37Johnson M.A. Pinto B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 15368-15374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here the saturation time of 2.4 s prevented us from quantitative analysis. Distance and Angle Constraints—The cross-peak volumes from trNOESY and trROESY experiments of the pentasaccharide in the presence of mIgAs were measured with the VNMR software. Distances between neighboring protons were calculated by the usual 1/r6 NOE/distance relationship (49Baleja J. Moult J. Sykes B.D. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 87: 375-384Google Scholar). NOE-derived and trROE distances were obtained from initial NOE build-up rates, which were calculated by NOE volumes fitting during different mixing times. The intra-residue distance of 2.52 Å between the H-1 and H-2 protons of the α-l-rhamnopyranosyl unit B was used as a reference for distance calibration. Distance constraints of free peptides were obtained from the ROESY spectrum run at 298 K with a 400-ms mixing time. For peptides in the presence of mIgA, distance constraints were obtained from the trNOESY spectra run at 298 K with a 200-ms mixing time. NOE intensities were evaluated from the height of the cross-peaks. For structure calculations, upper limit distances of 2.8, 3.5, and 5 Å were used for strong, medium, and weak NOEs, respectively (50Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The 3JNH-Hα values were used to restrain Φ angles as follows: for 3J >9 Hz, -155° < Φ < -85°; for 8 Hz < 3J <9 Hz, -175° < Φ < -65°; for 5 Hz < 3J <7 Hz, -105° < Φ < -55°; for 3J <5 Hz, -90° < Φ < -40° (51Pardi A. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—Structure calculations of free and bound peptides were run on a Silicon Graphics work station using the standard protocol of the DYANA program (52Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). A total of 100 structures were calculated using the torsion angle dynamics protocol. The structures were sorted according to the final value of the target function, and the 20 best structures were analyzed in terms of distance and angle violations. Of these 20 structures, the 10 best structures were visualized by using MOLMOL (53Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Homology Modeling of the IgA I3 Fab Fragment and Docking—The search for structures with sequences similarities was performed with Blast (54Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

Five structures of interest were downloaded and used as template by the Composer program for the building of VL and VH chains of IgA I3 (56Blundell T. Carney D. Gardner S. Hayes F. Howlin B.

https://openalex.org/W2093100161,"We have previously reported (Dobreva, I., Waeber, G., Mooser, V., James, R. W., and Widmann, C. (2003) J. Lipid Res. 44, 2382–2390) that low density lipoproteins (LDLs) induce activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, resulting in fibroblast spreading and lamellipodia formation. Here, we show that LDL-stimulated fibroblast spreading and wound sealing are due to secretion of a soluble factor. Using an antibody-based human protein array, interleukin-8 (IL-8) was identified as the main cytokine whose concentration was increased in supernatants from LDL-stimulated cells. Incubation of supernatants from LDL-treated cells with an anti-IL-8 blocking antibody completely abolished their ability to induce cell spreading and mediate wound closure. In addition, fibroblasts treated with recombinant IL-8 spread to the same extent as cells incubated with LDL or supernatants from LDL-treated cells. The ability of LDL and IL-8 to induce fibroblast spreading was mediated by the IL-8 receptor type II (CXCR-2). Furthermore, LDL-induced IL-8 production and subsequent wound closure required the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, because both processes were abrogated by a specific p38 inhibitor. Therefore, the capacity of LDLs to induce fibroblast spreading and accelerate wound closure relies on their ability to stimulate IL-8 secretion in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. Regulation of fibroblast shape and migration by lipoproteins may be relevant to atherosclerosis that is characterized by increased LDL cholesterol levels, IL-8 production, and extensive remodeling of the vessel wall. We have previously reported (Dobreva, I., Waeber, G., Mooser, V., James, R. W., and Widmann, C. (2003) J. Lipid Res. 44, 2382–2390) that low density lipoproteins (LDLs) induce activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, resulting in fibroblast spreading and lamellipodia formation. Here, we show that LDL-stimulated fibroblast spreading and wound sealing are due to secretion of a soluble factor. Using an antibody-based human protein array, interleukin-8 (IL-8) was identified as the main cytokine whose concentration was increased in supernatants from LDL-stimulated cells. Incubation of supernatants from LDL-treated cells with an anti-IL-8 blocking antibody completely abolished their ability to induce cell spreading and mediate wound closure. In addition, fibroblasts treated with recombinant IL-8 spread to the same extent as cells incubated with LDL or supernatants from LDL-treated cells. The ability of LDL and IL-8 to induce fibroblast spreading was mediated by the IL-8 receptor type II (CXCR-2). Furthermore, LDL-induced IL-8 production and subsequent wound closure required the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, because both processes were abrogated by a specific p38 inhibitor. Therefore, the capacity of LDLs to induce fibroblast spreading and accelerate wound closure relies on their ability to stimulate IL-8 secretion in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. Regulation of fibroblast shape and migration by lipoproteins may be relevant to atherosclerosis that is characterized by increased LDL cholesterol levels, IL-8 production, and extensive remodeling of the vessel wall. Abnormal activation of endothelial and smooth muscle cells plays a critical role in atherosclerosis progression (1Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19370) Google Scholar). Recent studies also report the active participation of a third vascular wall cell type, the adventitial fibroblasts, in the remodeling process observed in blood vessels during the development of the disease (2Sartore S. Chiavegato A. Faggin E. Franch R. Puato M. Ausoni S. Pauletto P. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In fact, adventitia is no longer viewed as a supporting tissue but rather as an important mediator of vascular remodeling (3Shi Y. O'Brien Jr., J.E. Ala-Kokko L. Chung W. Mannion J.D. Zalewski A. Circulation. 1997; 95: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4Miller Jr., F.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 722-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) making it a potential therapeutic target. Moreover, the adventitia appears to play a significant role in arterial repair (5Stenmark K.R. Bouchey D. Nemenoff R. Dempsey E.C. Das M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 49: 503-517Google Scholar, 6Stenmark K.R.

Biol. 2000; 22: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has been shown in experimental models of blood vessel injury that the adventitia goes through rapid transformations. Furthermore, the residing fibroblasts undergo phenotypic changes that contribute to tissue repair (8Zalewski A. Shi Y. Johnson A.G. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Tomasek J.J. Gabbiani G. Hinz B. Chaponnier C. Brown R.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar). In this case, fibroblast activation has beneficial effects. In contrast, if there is a continuous activation of the cells in the adventitia, aberrant tissue remodeling might participate in thickening of the blood vessels. Therefore, it is important to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in fibroblast activation. Lipoproteins, initially characterized as the main cholesterol cargos for cells, are now known to modulate various mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 2The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseBCECF-AM2′, 7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5 (6)-carboxyfluorescein tetrakis(acetoxymethyl) esterDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFCSfetal calf serumILinterleukinLDLlow density lipoproteinPBSphosphate-buffered saline. pathways in different cell types of the vessel wall (10Dobreva I.

However, the cellular responses resulting from the activation of a given MAPK cascade induced by lipoproteins vary considerably from one cell type to another. For example the p38 MAPK pathway mediates proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cell (13Gouni-Berthold I. Berthold H.K. Weber A.A. Seul C. Vetter H. Sachinidis A. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2001; 109: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and lamellipodia formation and cell spreading in fibroblasts in response to LDLs (10Dobreva I. Waeber G. Mooser V. James R.W.

The latter phenomenon might be relevant to vascular remodeling, as recent evidence indicates that activation of MAPKs in fibroblasts is involved in this process (reviewed in Ref. 6Stenmark K.R.

Chest. 2002; 122: 326S-334SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mitogen-activated protein kinase 2′, 7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5 (6)-carboxyfluorescein tetrakis(acetoxymethyl) ester Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal calf serum interleukin low density lipoprotein phosphate-buffered saline. In the present study, we have investigated how lipoproteins induce fibroblast spreading. Our results show that fibroblasts secrete IL-8 in response to LDLs in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. This, in turn, induces cell spreading and facilitates wound closure. Materials—Anti-human IL-8 mouse monoclonal antibody (catalog number 554726), recombinant human IL-8 (catalog number 554609), and the BD OptEIA human anti-IL8 ELISA kit (catalog number 550999) were from BD Biosciences. Anti-hemagglutinin-tagged mouse monoclonal antibody (HA11; catalog number AFC-101P) was from Covance. 2′, 7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5 (6)-carboxyfluorescein tetrakis(acetoxymethyl) ester (BCECF-AM) was purchased from Fluka (catalog number 14562). SB 239063 (trans-4-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(2-methoxy-4-pyrimidinyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl] cyclohexanol was from Tocris Bioscience (catalog number 1962). Anti-human CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 monoclonal antibodies were from R&D Systems (catalog numbers MAB330 and MAB331). Cell Culture—GM00316B human skin fibroblasts were purchased from Coriell Cell Repositories and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 15% non-decomplemented fetal calf serum (FCS; Amimed) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Lipoprotein and Lipoprotein-free Serum Preparation and Purification—LDLs were isolated from human serum by sequential density ultracentrifugation as described previously (14Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragton J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar, 15James R.W. Pometta D. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1158-1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), dialyzed for 48 h against PBS containing 100 μm EDTA, and stored under nitrogen. Human lipoprotein-free serum was prepared by the removal of lipoproteins via ultracentrifugation at a density of 1.23 g/liter (15James R.W. Pometta D. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1158-1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay using BSA as a standard. The cholesterol concentration was measured by an enzymatic in vitro test kit from Roche Applied Science (catalog number 2016630). Cell Spreading Measurements—Human fibroblasts were plated on uncoated 12-mm-diameter glass coverslips (VWR International; catalog number 6012401) in 6-well plates supplemented with DMEM and 15% FCS. On the following day, the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM. The cells were starved for 24 h, and cell surface was measured as follows. The cells were stained with the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM (5 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed three times with PBS, and visualized with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope. Cell area was measured on digital pictures of the cells using the ImageJ software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health; web site address rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). At least 20–50 cells per condition were analyzed. Actin Cytoskeleton Staining—Fibroblasts were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates, starved for 24 h in DMEM, and treated or not treated with the indicated amounts of LDL for another 24 h. The cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 3% sucrose for 30 min. Cell membranes were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and the actin cytoskeleton was stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (Invitrogen; catalog number R415). The cells were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA; catalog number H-1000), and pictures were taken with a confocal microscope Zeiss LSM 510 Meta using a 20× objective. Preparation of Cell Culture Supernatants—Human fibroblasts were plated in 10-cm plates in DMEM with 15% FCS and grown until confluence. The cells were then starved in DMEM containing 2.5 mg/ml human lipoprotein-free serum for 24 h and stimulated with vehicle (PBS containing 100 μm EDTA) or 200 μg/ml LDL for 30 min. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated in serum-free DMEM for 24 h. Cell culture supernatants were then collected and passed through 0.22-μm sterile Millipore filters. Aliquots of the supernatants were frozen at –20 °C or dialyzed against membranes with 3.5- or 100-kDa molecular mass cutoff in DMEM for 8 h (2× 4 h). The dialyzed supernatants were then filtered and incubated with naïve cells for 24 h. Cytokine Detection and Quantitation—Cell culture supernatants were collected from human fibroblasts that were incubated or not incubated with 200 μg/ml LDL for 24 h. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation of the supernatants at 500 g for 5 min. The supernatants were analyzed for the presence of cytokines by an antibody-based human cytokine array (Novagen ProteoPlex 16-well human cytokine array, catalog number 71414-3) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of the cytokines was determined according to standard curves provided for each cytokine. The microarray plates were scanned with a Packard Biochip Technologies scanner (PerkinElmer Life Science) using the ScanArray 4000 software. Quantitation of the individual spots was done by using the ImaGene software. Each cytokine concentration is presented as the mean of the intensity of four independent spots ± S.D. In addition, the amount of IL-8 in cell culture supernatants was measured with a human anti-IL-8 ELISA kit from BD Biosciences, and its concentration was determined according to a standard curve with a standard provided by the manufacturer. Time-lapse Microscopy—Cells were grown to confluence in a time-lapse chamber and starved in DMEM containing 0.1% FCS for 24 h. The cells were then wounded as described previously (16Kulkarni S.V. Gish G. Van der Geer P. Henkemeyer M. Pawson T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and preincubated or not preincubated with either 3 μm SB 239063 or 400 ng/ml anti-IL8 antibody for 30 min, and 200 μg/ml LDL were then added. The chamber was placed in a Nikon TE-2000-E inverted time-lapse microscope system, and pictures were taken with a 10× objective every 10 min for 2–3 days. Images and movies were analyzed with MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). Statistics—Comparisons between groups were made by homoscedastic two-tailed t test analysis using the Excel 2000 software. LDLs Induce Fibroblast Spreading and Facilitate Wound Closure—LDL stimulation of fibroblasts results in lamellipodia formation and cell spreading (10Dobreva I. Waeber G. Mooser V. James R.W. Widmann C. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2382-2390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To determine at which LDL concentration cell spreading occurs, fibroblasts were incubated with increasing concentrations of LDLs, and their surface and changes of the actin cytoskeleton were assessed. Fig. 1 shows that LDLs start to initiate spreading at concentrations of 50–100 μg/ml (but this did not reach statistical significance). Maximal spreading was achieved at LDL concentrations of 200 μg/ml and above. Spreading of fibroblasts induced by LDLs was associated with enlargement of the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 1A). To determine whether LDLs could promote wound repair, human fibroblast monolayers were wounded and stimulated or not with LDLs. The process of wound closure was followed by time-lapse video microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2 (see also the supplemental movie available with the on-line version of this article), LDL-stimulated cells populated the wounded area faster than control cells. LDLs can therefore induce cell spreading and migration into wounds, two processes that rely on modulation of the actin cytoskeleton (17Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). LDLs Induce Cell Spreading Indirectly by Stimulating Secretion of an Autocrine Factor—Because fibroblast lamellipodia formation and cell spreading in response to LDLs is initiated after a lag phase of ∼8 h (10Dobreva I. Waeber G. Mooser V. James R.W. Widmann C. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2382-2390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we assessed whether a continuous presence of LDLs is required for cell spreading to occur. Human fibroblasts were stimulated with vehicle or with 200 μg/ml LDLs for 30 min. LDLs were then removed by extensive washings. The cells stimulated with LDLs for only 30 min spread to the same extent as cells incubated with LDLs for 24 h (Fig. 3A). LDL removal by washing was effective, because stimulation of naïve cells with medium from washed cells did not induce cell spreading (Fig. 3, A and B). These results are compatible with the hypothesis that LDLs do not induce cell spreading directly but rather stimulate signal transduction pathways, such as the p38 MAPK pathway (10Dobreva I. Waeber G. Mooser V. James R.W. Widmann C. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2382-2390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), to produce a factor that causes cell spreading. To test this hypothesis, cells were stimulated with LDLs for 30 min, washed extensively, and incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h. This medium was then collected and placed on naïve cells. Fig. 3B shows that supernatants from cells transiently stimulated with LDLs, although not containing residual amounts of LDLs (see Fig. 3A, condition e), efficiently induced cell spreading. This finding indicates that LDL-stimulated cells secrete an autocrine factor able to induce spreading. To determine the molecular mass of this soluble factor, we compared the ability of supernatants from LDL-stimulated cells to induce the spreading of naïve cells after dialyses against 3.5- and 100-kDa cutoff membranes. The supernatants dialyzed against the 3.5-kDa cutoff membranes retained their ability to induce spreading, whereas the supernatants dialyzed against the 100-kDa cutoff membranes totally lost their spreading activity (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that LDL-treated cells secrete a soluble factor, the molecular mass of which is comprised between 3.5 and 100 kDa. Moreover, this confirms that the soluble factor does not correspond to LDLs (if any were left after the extensive washing and medium replacement), as the LDLs weigh more than 2 × 106 Da and would not be dialyzed off the 100-kDa cutoff membrane. LDL-stimulated Cells Secrete IL-8—Because LDLs induce p38 MAPK activation (10Dobreva I. Waeber G. Mooser V. James R.W. Widmann C. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2382-2390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 18Dobreva I. Zschörnig O. James R.W. Waeber G. Widmann C. Biol. Chem. 2005; 368: 909-918Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and because the p38 MAPK pathway is known to regulate the production of various autocrine factors such as members of the cytokine family (19Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Muller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), we determined whether specific cytokines were secreted after LDL stimulation. Using an antibody-based cytokine array, supernatants from control- or LDL-stimulated cells were analyzed for the presence of various human cytokines. Fig. 4 shows that IL-8 concentration in the culture medium is increased upon LDL stimulation. IL-6 release was also slightly induced in supernatants from these cells, whereas tumor necrosis factor concentrations were slightly decreased in comparison to control cells (Fig. 4B). However, after determination of the concentrations of these cytokines under different experimental conditions, we concluded that IL-8 is the only cytokine whose release is systematically and markedly increased in supernatants of LDL-treated cells. IL-8 Is Responsible for LDL-mediated Cell Spreading and Wound Closure—Two different approaches were used to assess whether increased secretion of IL-8 in supernatants of LDL-stimulated cells leads to changes in cell morphology. First, supernatants from LDL-treated cells were pre-incubated with an anti-human IL-8 blocking antibody. As shown in Fig. 5A, supernatants from LDL-treated cells that were incubated with the anti-IL-8 antibody completely lost their ability to stimulate the spreading of naïve cells. In contrast, supernatants from LDL-treated cells pre-incubated with the same amount of an unrelated isotype-matched control antibody (anti-HA11) did not loose their ability to induce cell spreading. To confirm that the presence of IL-8 is sufficient to trigger spreading of the cells, human fibroblasts were incubated with increasing concentrations of recombinant human IL-8. As shown in Fig. 5B, this resulted in an enlargement of their surface. This increase was initiated at 100 pg/ml IL-8 and reached its maximum at 200 pg/ml, which corresponds to the amounts of IL-8 measured in the supernatants of LDL-stimulated cells (see Fig. 4B). In addition, cells treated with recombinant human IL-8 spread to the same extent as cells incubated with LDL or supernatants from LDL-treated cells (Fig. 5B). Moreover, neutralization of IL-8 by the addition of an anti-IL8 blocking antibody abrogated the ability of fibroblasts to mediate wound closure in response to LDL (Fig. 5C; see also supplemental movie). CXCR-2, but Not CXCR-1, Mediates Fibroblast Spreading Induced by LDL and IL-8—To determine which one of the IL-8 receptors mediates the ability of LDL and IL-8 to induce fibroblast spreading, we neutralized the two IL-8 receptors by the addition of blocking antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6, the anti-CXCR-2 antibody completely inhibited LDL- and IL-8-induced fibroblast spreading. In contrast, the antibody directed at CXCR-1 or an unrelated isotype-matched control antibody (HA11) did not affect cell spreading. This indicates that modulation of cell shape as a result of LDL-induced IL-8 secretion requires activation of the IL-8 receptor type II in fibroblasts. LDL-stimulated IL-8 Secretion and Wound Closure Are Mediated by the p38 MAPK Pathway—Because LDL-induced p38 MAPK activation is required for fibroblast lamellipodia formation and cell spreading (10Dobreva I. Waeber G. Mooser V. James R.W. Widmann C. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2382-2390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we assessed whether activation of this signaling cascade mediates IL-8 production in response to LDLs. Fig. 7A shows that the increase in IL-8 concentration in supernatants from LDL-treated cells is blocked by SB 239063, a specific p38 inhibitor. The concentration of the inhibitor used here (3 μm) has been shown to specifically block the p38 MAPK pathway but not the related extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase MAPK pathways in fibroblasts (18Dobreva I. Zschörnig O. James R.W. Waeber G. Widmann C. Biol. Chem. 2005; 368: 909-918Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 7A indicate therefore that the p38 MAPK pathway mediates the induction of IL-8 production in response to LDLs. In addition, inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway abrogates fibroblast wound healing induced by LDLs (Fig. 7B; see also supplemental movie). Taken together, these data show that LDLs mediate cell spreading and wound repair indirectly by stimulating IL-8 secretion in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. We have recently shown that, in fibroblasts, LDL-induced p38 MAPK activation results in cell spreading and lamellipodia formation (10Dobreva I. Waeber G. Mooser V. James R.W. Widmann C. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2382-2390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We have determined now that LDLs also contribute to accelerated wound healing. Analysis of supernatants from LDL-stimulated fibroblasts demonstrated that these cells produce a soluble factor able to induce cell spreading. Using an antibody-based human cytokine array, IL-8 was identified as the main cytokine secreted from LDL-stimulated cells. Incubation of these cells with purified IL-8 was sufficient to induce their spreading. As we have shown earlier that LDLs induce cell spreading in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner (10Dobreva I. Waeber G. Mooser V. James R.W. Widmann C. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2382-2390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we propose that LDLs stimulate p38 MAPK activation, which promotes the IL-8 secretion that, in turn, induces cell spreading. In support of this notion is the fact that LDL-induced IL-8 production and subsequent wound closure are abrogated in the presence of a specific p38 inhibitor (Fig. 7, A and B). Activation of the p38 MAPK pathway has been shown to regulate the stability of mRNAs encoding various cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein MCP-1, and granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor), metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3), and adhesion molecules (P-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1) (20Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). LDL-induced p38 MAPK activation might therefore allow fibroblasts to stabilize the IL-8 mRNA and consequently lead to an increased secretion of the cytokine. LDL oxidation, which can occur in various pathophysiological situations (elevated LDL plasma levels, increased retention of LDLs in the circulation, or trapping of LDL particles in the sub-endothelial space of blood vessels), may contribute to the induction of IL-8 as was previously reported in macrophages (21Terkeltaub R. Banka C.L. Solan J. Santoro D. Brand K. Curtiss L.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 47-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, although oxidation may increase the ability of LDLs to activate the p38 MAPK pathway in fibroblasts (10Dobreva I. Waeber G. Mooser V. James R.W. Widmann C. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2382-2390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we have found that activation of this pathway does not correlate with the accumulation of oxidized products but with the amount of cholesterol present in the lipoprotein particles (18Dobreva I. Zschörnig O. James R.W. Waeber G. Widmann C. Biol. Chem. 2005; 368: 909-918Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We therefore suggest that the ability of LDLs to stimulate IL-8 secretion and cell spreading does not require their oxidation. It has been proposed that enzymatic, nonoxidative modifications could render LDLs more atherogenic. These enzymatically degraded, nonoxidized LDLs (E-LDLs), which were found in early atherosclerotic lesions, could stimulate the expression of gp130, the signal-transducing chain of the IL-6 receptor as well as IL-6 secretion (22Klouche M. Rose-John S. Schmiedt W. Bhakdi S. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there is an increase in the amount of free cholesterol in the E-LDLs in comparison to native LDLs. In addition, we have shown that the rate of p38 MAPK activation is proportional to the free cholesterol concentration in lipoproteins (18Dobreva I. Zschörnig O. James R.W. Waeber G. Widmann C. Biol. Chem. 2005; 368: 909-918Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore the production of cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8, which is mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway, may be induced by an increase in lipoprotein cholesterol levels. IL-8 is believed to be a pro-atherogenic factor, because it can increase monocyte adhesion to the endothelium and exert a mitogenic effect on endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (23Li A. Dubey S. Varney M.L. Dave B.J. Singh R.K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 24Yue T.L. Wang X. Sung C.P. Olson B. McKenna P.J. Gu J.L. Feuerstein G.Z. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the pro-atherogenic role of IL-8 are the observations that the expression of IL-8 is up-regulated in human atherosclerotic arterial walls (25Rus H.G. Vlaicu R. Niculescu F. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 127: 263-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and that IL-8 concentration is increased in patients with hypercholesterolemia (26Porreca E. Sergi R. Baccante G. Reale M. Orsini L. Febbo C.D. Caselli G. Cuccurullo F. Bertini R. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 146: 345-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Various hematopoietic cell lineages secrete IL-8 in response to elevated lipoprotein concentrations. For example, peripheral blood mononuclear cells produce IL-8 in hypercholesterolemic patients (26Porreca E. Sergi R. Baccante G. Reale M. Orsini L. Febbo C.D. Caselli G. Cuccurullo F. Bertini R. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 146: 345-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and natural killer cells secrete IL-8 in response to LDL (27De Sanctis J.B. Blanca I. Bianco N.E. Immunology. 1997; 90: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Lipoproteins also stimulate endothelial cells to produce IL-8 (28De Castellarnau C. Sanchez-Quesada J.L. Benitez S. Rosa R. Caveda L. Vila L. Ordonez-Llanos J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2281-2287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which favors their proliferation and migration (29Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Harlow L.A. DiPietro L.A. Elner V.M. Elner S.G. Strieter R.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1798-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). Together with the results presented here, these studies indicate that a great variety of the blood vessel cell types and cells able to infiltrate blood vessels have the capacity to secrete IL-8 in response to lipoproteins. It has been demonstrated that under hypercholesterolemic conditions there is an induction of angiogenesis in the adventitia, which may be a part of the early atherosclerotic remodeling (30Kwon H.M. Sangiorgi G. Ritman E.L. McKenna C. Holmes Jr., D.R. Schwartz R.S. Lerman A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This is accompanied by an increase in the vessel wall area of hypercholesterolemic coronary arteries. The observed changes in the vascular wall in response to hypercholesterolemia may therefore involve IL-8 production from several distinct cell types. IL-8-mediated spreading of fibroblasts (and possibly other cell types) in blood vessel walls could have different outcomes. The increase in cell surface, which facilitates wound healing, is considered as positive remodeling. However, chronic production of IL-8, as a result of hyperlipidemia for example, would trigger hyperplasia that can contribute to vessel wall thickening and accelerate the atherogenic process. This, along with the fact that thickening of blood vessels can be inhibited by p38 MAPK inhibitors (31Ohashi N. Matsumori A. Furukawa Y. Ono K. Okada M. Iwasaki A. Miyamoto T. Nakano A. Sasayama S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2521-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), supports the notion that activation of the p38 MAPK pathway could participate in the thickening of the arterial walls observed during atherogenesis. It will be important in the future to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying adventitia transformation in order to better understand its role in vascular remodeling in respect to pathological situations such as atherosclerosis. Our results highlight the possibility that adventitial fibroblasts, by secreting IL-8 and modulating cell shape changes, may play important roles in the development of atherosclerosis.

Cholesterol lowering activates human ABCD2 in cultured cells. To investigate in vivo regulation by sterols, we first characterized a sterol regulatory element (SRE) in the murine Abcd2 promoter that is directly bound by SRE-binding proteins (SREBPs). Intriguingly, this element overlaps with a direct repeat 4, which serves as binding site for liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor heterodimers, suggesting novel cross-talk between SREBP and LXR/retinoid X receptor in gene regulation. Using fasting-refeeding and cholesterol loading, SREBP accessibility to the SRE/direct repeat 4 was tested. Results suggest that adipose Abcd2 is induced by SREBP1c, whereas hepatic Abcd2 expression is down-regulated by concurrent activation of LXRα and SREBP1c. In cell culture, SREBP1c-mediated Abcd2 induction is counteracted by ligand-activated LXRα. Finally, hepatic Abcd2 expression in LXRα,β-deficient mice is inducible to levels vastly exceeding wild type. Together, we identify LXRα as negative modulator of Abcd2, acting through a novel regulatory mechanism involving overlapping SREBP and LXRα binding sites.

Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. Powers J. Moser A.B. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 2001: 3257-3301Google Scholar).

Next to ALDP, three additional mammalian peroxisomal ABC half-transporters have been identified: adrenoleukodystrophy-related protein (ALDRP), 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP70), and PMP70-related protein (P70R), sharing 66, 39, and 25% amino acid identity with ALDP, respectively. Thus, the ABCD2-encoded ALDRP is the protein most closely related to ALDP and upon overexpression can functionally compensate for ALDP deficiency in X-ALD fibroblasts and Abcd1-deficient mice (2Netik A.

Therefore, pharmacological stimulation of ABCD2 expression has been targeted as an alternative therapeutic strategy for X-ALD (4Kemp S. Wei H.M. Lu J.F. Braiterman L.T. McGuinness M.C. Moser A.B. Watkins P.A. Smith K.D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1261-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), requiring detailed knowledge about how the ABCD2 gene is transcriptionally regulated. We recently showed that human ABCD2 is induced upon cholesterol depletion in cultured cells via a mechanism requiring the activation and binding of sterol regulatory element (SRE)-binding proteins (SREBPs) (5Weinhofer I. Forss-Petter S. Zigman M. Berger J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2701-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). SREBPs, which are synthesized as membrane-bound precursors and cleaved to generate the active nuclear form, are a class of transcription factors known to play a major role in regulating genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 6Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar). To date, three SREBPs have been identified: SREBP1a and SREBP1c, which are produced from a single gene and preferentially regulate fatty acid synthesis, and SREBP2, encoded by a separate gene and controlling expression of cholesterogenic genes (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). Actively growing cultured cells predominantly produce SREBP1a, whereas in vivo, SREBP1c is much more abundant (8Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Abcd1-deficient mice mimic the biochemical defect found in X-ALD patients, i.e. accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids in tissues (9Forss-Petter S. Werner H. Berger J. Lassmann H. Molzer B.

A. 1997; 94: 9366-9371Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Thus, a model is available to evaluate the efficacy of cholesterol-lowering drugs on SREBP maturation and Abcd2 induction as a future therapeutic agent for X-ALD. This requires investigation of in vivo accessibility and inducibility of Abcd2 by SREBPs. Intriguingly, the Abcd2 SRE overlaps with a direct repeat separated by 4 nucleotides (DR-4) that fits the consensus sequence of the 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or the liver X receptor (LXR) response element. Thus, in this particular case, TR or LXR could possibly interfere with binding and activation of the Abcd2 promoter by SREBP. Recently, direct binding of TRβ homodimer or TRβ/RXRα heterodimer complexes to the rat Abcd2 SRE/DR-4 and inducibility by triiodothyronine has been demonstrated (12Fourcade S. Savary S. Gondcaille C. Berger J. Netik A. Cadepond F. El Etr M. Molzer B. Bugaut M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, no study has addressed a possible role of LXRα in Abcd2 regulation. The LXR subfamily of nuclear receptors, consisting of LXRα and LXRβ, emerged as key mediator of cholesterol homeostasis (13Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). LXRs function as cholesterol sensors that respond to elevated sterol concentrations by initiating expression of genes involved in cholesterol efflux, bile acid production, and lipid transport (14Zhang Y. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Interv. 2002; 2: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). LXRα has a dual role in gene expression: the ligand-receptor complex up-regulates many target genes, whereas the unliganded receptor suppresses gene expression by recruiting corepressor proteins (15Hu X. Li S. Wu J. Xia C. Lala D.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, activated LXRs down-regulate transcription of a subset of genes, as in the case of matrix metalloproteinase-9 or 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (16Castrillo A. Joseph S.B. Marathe C. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10443-10449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 17Stulnig T.M. Oppermann U. Steffensen K.R. Schuster G.U. Gustafsson J.A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2426-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, so far no investigation has demonstrated that the underlying mechanism involves a direct interaction of LXR with LXREs in the repressed target genes. The aim of the present study was to (a) evaluate whether murine Abcd2 is inducible by SREBP, (b) investigate the relevance of the SRE motif for in vivo transcriptional regulation of Abcd2 by either fasting-refeeding or dietary “cholesterol loading” or “cholesterol depletion” of mice, (c) characterize the physiological relevance of the overlapping SRE and DR-4 motifs for Abcd2 expression, and (d) evaluate a putative modulatory effect of LXR on Abcd2 mRNA levels in cell culture and in mice. Animals and Treatment—Male 4–6-month-old wild type C57BL/6 mice were kept at a temperature of 22 °C with equal periods of darkness and light. For high cholesterol or lovastatin/colestipol treatment, mice were fed ad libitum either a standard diet, a standard diet enriched with 2% cholesterol, or a standard diet supplemented with 0.1% lovastatin and 2% colestipol (ssniff). Groups consisting of three animals were treated for either 1 or 6 weeks and sacrificed in the middle of the light phase. For fasting-refeeding, 3-month-old male wild type mice were divided into three groups, each consisting of three mice: nonfasted, fasted, and fasted/refed. The nonfasted group was fed ad libitum a standard chow (ssniff). The fasted group was starved for 24 h (sacrificed at the end of the light phase), and the fasted/refed group was fasted for 24 h and then refed a high carbohydrate/low fat diet (ssniff) for 12 h prior to study (sacrificed at the beginning of the light phase). For studies involving treatment of wild type and LXRα,β-deficient mice with the synthetic RXRα and LXR ligands, LG268 and T0901317, respectively, 3–4-month-old mixed C57BL/6:129/SvEv mice were used (6 animals/group). Mice were fed ad libitum a standard chow diet (number 7001; Teklad) supplemented with either T0901317 (50 mg/kg body weight) or LG268 (30 mg/kg body weight) or both. Control animals were dosed with vehicle. Animals were treated for 12 h and sacrificed at the beginning of the light phase. Cell Culture—COS-7 and THP-1 cells (ATCC) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biowhittaker). For cholesterol depletion, standard fetal calf serum was substituted with 10% lipoprotein-deficient fetal calf serum (Sigma). 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22-(R)-HC; Sigma) was used at 10 μm for 24 h. Plasmid Construction and in Vitro Mutagenesis—Abcd2 promoter fragments were generated by PCR using the antisense primer containing a XhoI site (-96, 5′-GCCTCCCATGCTCTCGAGCTTGTCTCC-3′) and various sense primers containing a MluI site (-3623, 5′-ATGCTTCAAGACGCGTGGGCAAGCAC-3′, 3515 bp; -1594, 5′-CACACAAGTGACGCGTTGTGATGTGAC-3′, 1486 bp; -607, 5′-CTGACGCGTTTCCCTGGGCCGGTTCCG-3′, 499 bp). PCR fragments were cloned into the XhoI/MluI-digested vector pGL3basic (Promega) upstream from the luciferase gene. The expression vector pGLUC (18Fourcade S. Savary S. Albet S. Gauthe D.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 3490-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), containing the minimal β-globin promoter upstream from a luciferase gene, was used for studies of the isolated response element. The annealed double-stranded SRE sequence containing oligonucleotides with HindIII and BamHI overhangs (mAbcd2-SRE: 5′-AGCTTATCGATAGCAGCTGACCTCATTCGACCG-3′, 5′-GATCCGGTCGAATGAGGTCAGCTGCTATCGATA-3′) were ligated into BamHI/HindIII-digested pGLUC to generate pGl-mAbcd2-SREluc. The point mutations M1 and M2 were introduced using the following pairs of annealed oligonucleotides: pGl-mAbcd2-SRE-M1, 5′-AGCTTATCGATCGCCGCTGACCTCATTCGACCG-3′, 5′-GATCCGGTCGAATGAGGTCAGCGGCGATCGATA-3′; pGl-mAbcd2-SRE-M2, 5′-AGCTTATCGATCGCGGCTGACCTCATTCGACCG-3′, 5′-GATCCGGTCGAATGAGGTCAGCCGCGATCGATA-3′. Mutations in the Abcd2 promoter constructs were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and complementary degenerate primers (5′-AGCAGCTGACCTCATTCGgCCgCTCCAGAAATAG-3′ and 5′-CTATTTCTGGAGcGGcCGAATGAGGTCAGCTGCT-3′). Transient Transfection Experiments—COS-7 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 0.5 μg of pGLUC or pGL3basic construct, 0.1 μg of SREBP1a/1c/2-expression vector (kindly provided by Dr. Timothy Osborne, University of California, Irvine, CA), 0.1 μg of LXRα expression vector (19Repa J.J.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar), and 0.05 μg of pCMV-β-Gal (Clontech). Transfected cells were incubated with or without 22-(R)-HC for 24 h and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity (5Weinhofer I. Forss-Petter S. Zigman M. Berger J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2701-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—SREBP1a, LXRα, and RXRα were synthesized in vitro using the TNT T7 Quick for PCR in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega) and the primers SREBP1a 5′-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAACAGCCACCATGGACGAGCCACCCTTCAG-3′ (forward), 5′-T 29ACTATGTCAGGCTCCGAGTCACTGCCA-3′ (reverse); LXRα 5′-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAACAGCCACCATGTCCTTGTGGCTGGGGGCC-3′ (forward), 5′-T 29TCATTCGTGCACATCCCAGATCTCAG-3′ (reverse); RXRα 5′-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAACAGCCACCATGGACACCAAACATTTCCTG-3′ (forward), 5′-T 29ACTAGGTGGTTTGATGTGGGGCCTCCAG-3′ (reverse) and the SREBP1a, LXRα, and RXRα expression plasmids as templates, respectively. Complementary oligonucleotides were 5′-GTTCTCCAGCAGCTGACCTCATTCGACCT-3′ and 5′-TGGAGAGGTCGAATGAGGTCAGCTGCTGG-3′, mAbcd2-SRE/DR-4; 5′-AGGCAGAGGGAACAGCAGATTGTG-3′ and 5′-TCTGCACAATCTGCTGTTCCCTC-3′, mScd1-SRE; 5′-AGGTGGTTGACCCGAGGTAACCCCT-3′ and 5′-CGAGGGGTTACCTCGGGTCAAC-3′, chicken acetyl-CoA carboxylase-LXRE. Oligonucleotides for competition experiments were murine growth hormone receptor 3 (Ghr3) 5′-CTGGTTAGTTCATATTGTTGTTCCACCAATAGGGTTG-3′ and 5′-GTCTGCAACCCTATTGGTGGAACAACAATATGAACTAA-3′. Labeling of probes and binding experiments were performed as described (5Weinhofer I. Forss-Petter S. Zigman M. Berger J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2701-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For EMSA experiments involving LXRα, incubation occurred with or without 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol (100 μm). The gel migration was documented by exposure to x-ray films. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot—Total RNA was isolated from murine liver using TriPure isolation reagent (Roche Applied Science) and a Polytron PT3100 homogenizer (Kinematica). Membranes containing 10 μg of total RNA/lane were hybridized with a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe as described (5Weinhofer I. Forss-Petter S. Zigman M. Berger J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2701-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Probes were: acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (36B4, nucleotides 9–969, GenBank™ accession code BC011106), Abcd2 (nucleotides 92–405, GenBank™ accession code BC019187), cytochrome p450 7α1 (Cyp7A1, nucleotides 1033–1435, GenBank™ accession code L23754), and SREBP1c (GenBank™ accession code NM004176). Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR)—From total RNA, cDNA was generated by reverse transcription (GeneAmp RNA PCR kit; Applied Biosystems), and 12 ng per assay was analyzed using the iCycler iQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). For quantification of murine Abcd2 mRNA the forward primer nt1959, 5′-CACAGCGTGCACCTCTAC-3′, reverse primer nt2032, 5′-AGGACATCTTTCCAGTCCA-3′, and the TaqMan fluorescent probe nt1986, 5′-HEX-CAAAGAGAAGGAGGATGGGATGC-TAMRA-3′ were used. For human ABCD2, primers were nt1883 5′-TCCTACACAATGTCCATCTCT-3′ (forward), nt1961 5′-AGGACATCTTTCCAGTCCA-3′ (reverse), nt1915 5′-HEX-CAAAGAGAAGGAGGATGGGATCG-TAMRA-3′ (TaqMan probe).

The standard curves for quantification were generated by serial dilution of plasmids containing ABCD2 (20Berger J. Albet S. Bentejac M. Netik A. Holzinger A. Roscher A.A. Bugaut M. Forss-Petter S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or hydroxy-phosphoribosyl transferase cDNA (21Konecki D.S. Brennand J. Fuscoe J.C. Caskey C.T. Chinault A.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6763-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. D. W. Melton (University of Edinburgh, UK). The thermocycler was programmed: 95 °C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s and 58 °C for 50 s. For quantification of ATP binding cassette transporter 1 (Abca1), QRT-PCR was performed as described (22Bookout A.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. NURSA e-Journal. 2003; 1Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Murine liver was homogenized in five volumes of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0; 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mix complete (Roche Applied Science)) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in buffer A containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, separated by SDS-PAGE (8%), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schnell). Proteins were detected using the antibodies anti-SREBP1: 2A4 (1:2500), anti-SREBP2: H164 (1:1000) (both Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-β-actin: Mab1501 (1:10,000, Chemikon) and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse (Dako) or anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad, both 1:50,000). Visualization was performed using Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). For reprobing, blots were washed three times with buffer B (0.2 m glycine, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.5) and neutralized with Tris-buffered saline-T. A Functional SRE Is Present in the Murine Abcd2 Promoter That Is Preferentially Activated by SREBP1—A computer-based search of 3.5 kb of murine Abcd2 promoter sequence (GenBank™ accession code AF302500) led to the identification of an SRE-like motif located at a similar position as in the human ABCD2 gene (5Weinhofer I. Forss-Petter S. Zigman M. Berger J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2701-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and differing by only two bp (Fig. 1). To test the functionality of the putative SRE, various extents between 0.5 and 3.5 kb (see “Experimental Procedures”) of the murine Abcd2 promoter were fused to a luciferase gene. These reporter constructs were used to transiently transfect COS-7 cells, together with a plasmid encoding either the mature forms of SREBP1a, SREBP1c, or SREBP2 or the empty vector pCMV5 (Fig. 2a). The luciferase activity increased in an SREBP-dependent manner with all three Abcd2 promoter constructs. The highest levels of induction were observed after cotransfection with cDNAs encoding the SREBP1 isoforms. In contrast, cotransfection with SREBP2 resulted only in a low and, with the exception of the intermediate promoter construct (Abcd2–1486luc), barely statistically significant increase in reporter activity (Fig. 2a).FIGURE 2Murine Abcd2 expression is directly stimulated by SREBP. COS-7 cells were transiently cotransfected with luciferase reporter constructs driven by murine Abcd2 promoter regions of various length (3,515, 1,486, or 460 bp) (a)orthe isolated wild type SRE from the murine Abcd2 gene (b) or the SRE sequence with introduced point mutations M1 and M2 (pGl-mAbcd2-SRE-M1luc and pGl-mAbcd2-SRE-M2luc) cloned into the β-globin minimal promoter context (c), together with expression plasmids encoding the mature form of either human SREBP1a, SREBP1c, or SREBP2 or the empty vector pCMV5 as a negative control. Cotransfection with pCMV-βGal allowed for correction of the transfection efficiency in all experiments. The data are shown as luciferase activity (Luc) normalized to β-galactosidase activity (β-Gal) (a) and as -fold induction of Luc normalized to β-galactosidase (b, c) after SREBP cotransfection. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of four samples; for pGl-mAbcd2-SRE-M2luc, n = 2. Statistically significant differences by Student′s t test are indicated by asterisks (p < 0.05). d, EMSA using in vitro synthesized SREBP1a and a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the murine Abcd2 SRE show a band shift (lane 4). Specificity of the interaction was tested by cross-competition with excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the Scd1 SRE (lane 5) and with the unrelated competitor mGh3 (lane 6). Radioactively labeled Scd1 SRE oligonucleotide was used as a positive control (lane 3). Incubation of the labeled probe with unprimed reticulocyte lysate did not result in complex formation (lanes 1 and 2). Specific bands are marked by an arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The fact that the shortest Abcd2 promoter construct (Abcd2–499luc) was still activated by SREBP strongly suggested a proximal location of the SRE. To test whether the candidate SRE sequence (5′-AGCAGCTGACC-3′, nucleotide -389 to -379) is sufficient to confer SREBP-dependent activation, it was cloned into a luciferase reporter construct upstream from a minimal β-globin promoter to generate pGl-mAbcd2-SREluc. Cotransfection with this construct and SREBP expression vectors clearly identified this element as a functional SRE (Fig. 2b). Again, induction was best conferred by SREBP1, reflecting the situation seen with the reporter constructs harboring the SRE in its natural context of the Abcd2 promoter (Fig. 2a). To confirm the requirement of the identified regulatory element in SREBP-mediated induction of the Abcd2 promoter, we replaced the putative SRE in the minimal β-globin promoter context with two different mutated versions (pGl-mAbcd2-SRE-M1luc and pGl-mAbcd2-SRE-M2luc in Fig. 2c). For both constructs, the activation in response to SREBP1c cotransfection was significantly impaired, whereas only mutation M2 abrogated the induction by SREBP1a (Fig. 2c). SREBP Directly Interacts with the SRE from the Abcd2 Gene—To establish whether the Abcd2-SRE can be directly bound by SREBP, EMSAs were carried out (Fig. 2d). The incubation of a 32P-labeled Abcd2 SRE oligonucleotide probe with in vitro produced mature SREBP1a resulted in the formation of a protein-DNA complex (Fig. 2d, lane 4). SREBP1c was not incorporated in this study because its DNA-binding domain is identical to that of SREBP1a. To assess the specificity of this protein-DNA interaction, cross-competition using a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the SRE from the murine stearyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1) promoter was performed, resulting in reduced amounts of complex formation (Fig. 2d, lane 5). In contrast, the unrelated competitor mGh3 (murine growth hormone receptor 3) DNA was unable to inhibit SREBP1a binding (Fig. 2d, lane 6). As a positive control, complex formation between labeled oligonucleotide containing the Scd1 SRE and SREBP1a is shown (Fig. 2d, lane 3). Thus, the results indicate that a direct interaction is possible between the SRE from the Abcd2 gene and SREBP1. In Fasted-Refed Mice, Abcd2 Expression Correlates with SREBP1c-activated Genes in Adipose and PPARα-regulated Genes in the Liver— To determine whether SREBP1c also regulates Abcd2 expression in vivo, a fasting-refeeding protocol (see “Experimental Procedures”) was employed. In this paradigm, typical SREBP1c-regulated genes like fatty acid synthase (Fas) are induced after fasting when mice are refed a high carbohydrate/low fat diet (23Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). When mice were fasted, Abcd2 mRNA levels markedly declined in white adipose tissue and were re-induced when mice were refed a high carbohydrate/low fat diet (Fig. 3a). These results show that during a fasting-refeeding protocol, adipose Abcd2 expression correlates with the level of mature SREBP1c and thus with genes induced under conditions of fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis. In the liver, fasting led to increased Abcd2 mRNA levels that returned to pre-fasted levels upon refeeding (Fig. 3, b and c). As expected, hepatic Fas expression was found to be strongly induced in the refed state, whereas fasting induced acyl-CoA oxidase, encoding the key enzyme of the fatty acid degradation pathway, which is controlled by the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α (Fig. 3c). Thus, in accordance with our previous studies involving synthetic PPARα agonists (20Berger J. Albet S. Bentejac M. Netik A. Holzinger A. Roscher A.A. Bugaut M. Forss-Petter S. Eur. J.

Hepatic Abcd2 Expression Is Down-regulated by Dietary Cholesterol—To investigate whether SREBP1c plays a role in regulating hepatic Abcd2 expression under conditions when PPARα is not activated, we studied the effect of a dietary modulation of cholesterol levels in mice fed a diet containing 2% cholesterol (for comparison, the standard mouse chow contains only 0.01% cholesterol). In this feeding paradigm, excess cholesterol results in LXRα activation in the murine liver, which induces SREBP1c transcription but also cholesterol storage and efflux through conversion to bile acids (26Tontonoz P. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Hepatic Abcd2 expression was evaluated after 1 and 6 weeks by QRT-PCR and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4, a and b). Surprisingly, a high cholesterol diet led to significantly reduced Abcd2 mRNA levels in the liver after 1 week and a further down-regulation after 6 weeks of treatment (Fig. 4, a and b). In contrast, SREBP1c was consistently induced after 1 and 6 weeks of cholesterol feeding. In addition, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7A1) mRNA, encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis, was up-regulated after 1 week (Fig. 4b). As both genes are directly controlled by LXRα, their induction serves as a positive control for the treatment paradigm, indicating that LXRα was activated by cholesterol feeding. At the protein level, high cholesterol feeding resulted in increased levels of cleaved SREBP1c, whereas SREBP2 was barely detectable by Western blot analysis before and after feeding a cholesterol-enriched diet (Fig. 4c), thus confirming previous studies. From these results, it appears that although a functional SRE is present in the Abcd2 promoter and SREBP1c is amply available, SREBP recruitment is not possible under conditions of concomitant LXRα activation.

Alterations in any of these cellular responses could be related to increased genomic instability. Our previous study has shown that mutations in p53 lead to hypermutability to ionizing radiation. To investigate further how p53 is involved in regulating mutational processes, we used 8K cDNA microarrays to compare the patterns of gene expression among three closely related human cell lines with different p53 status including TK6 (wild-type p53), NH32 (p53-null), and WTK1 (mutant p53). Total RNA samples were collected at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 24 h after 10 Gy gamma-irradiation. Template-based clustering analysis of the gene expression over the time course showed that 464 genes are either up or downregulated by at least twofold following radiation treatment. In addition, cluster analyses of gene expression profiles among these three cell lines revealed distinct patterns. In TK6, 165 genes were upregulated, while 36 genes were downregulated. In contrast, in WTK1 75 genes were upregulated and 12 genes were downregulated. In NH32, only 54 genes were upregulated. Furthermore, we found several genes associated with DNA repair namely p53R2, DDB2, XPC, PCNA, BTG2, and MSH2 that were highly induced in TK6 compared to WTK1 and NH32. p53R2, which is regulated by the tumor suppressor p53, is a small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. To determine whether it is involved in radiation-induced mutagenesis, p53R2 protein was inhibited by siRNA in TK6 cells and followed by 2 Gy radiation. The background mutation frequencies at the TK locus of siRNA-transfected TK6 cells were about three times higher than those seen in TK6 cells. The mutation frequencies of siRNA-transfected TK6 cells after 2 Gy radiation were significantly higher than the irradiated TK6 cells without p53R2 knock down. These results indicate that p53R2 was induced by p53 protein and is involved in protecting against radiation-induced mutagenesis."

Here, we have shown that the levels of p16INK4a are decreased in human and murine fibroblasts upon exposure to relatively high concentrations of trichostatin A and sodium butyrate. Interestingly, the levels of p19ARF are strongly upregulated in murine cells even at low concentrations of HDACis. Using ARF-deficient cells, we have demonstrated that p19ARF plays an active role in HDACi-triggered cytostasis and the contribution of p19ARF to this arrest is of higher magnitude than that of the well established HDACi target p21Waf1/Cip. Moreover, chemically induced fibrosarcomas in ARF-null mice are more resistant to the therapeutic effect of HDACis than similar tumors in wild type or p21Waf1/Cip-null mice. Together, our results have established the tumor suppressor ARF as a relevant target for HDACi chemotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2003526568,"In gastrointestinal cells, biological signals for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) are transduced through transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors that signal to Smad proteins. Smad4, a tumor suppressor, is often mutated in human gastrointestinal cancers. The mechanism of Smad4 inactivation, however, remains uncertain and could be through E3-mediated ubiquitination of Smad4/adaptor protein complexes. Disruption of ELF (embryonic liver fodrin), a Smad4 adaptor protein, modulates TGF-β signaling. We have found that PRAJA, a RING-H2 protein, interacts with ELF in a TGF-β-dependent manner, with a fivefold increase of PRAJA expression and a subsequent decrease in ELF and Smad4 expression, in gastrointestinal cancer cell lines (P<0.05). Strikingly, PRAJA manifests substantial E3-dependent ubiquitination of ELF and Smad3, but not Smad4. Δ-PRAJA, which has a deleted RING finger domain at the C terminus, abolishes ubiquitination of ELF. A stable cell line that overexpresses PRAJA exhibits low levels of ELF in comparison to a Δ-PRAJA stable cell line, where ELF expression is high compared to normal controls. The alteration of ELF and/or Smad4 expression and/or function in the TGF-β signaling pathway may be induced by enhancement of ELF degradation, which is mediated by a high-level expression of PRAJA in gastrointestinal cancers. In hepatocytes, half-life (t1/2) and rate constant for degradation (kD) of ELF is 1.91 h and 21.72 min−1 when coupled with ectopic expression of PRAJA in cells stimulated by TGF-β, compared to PRAJA-transfected unstimulated cells (t1/2=4.33 h and kD=9.6 min−1). These studies reveal a mechanism for tumorigenesis whereby defects in adaptor proteins for Smads, such as ELF, can undergo degradation by PRAJA, through the ubiquitin-mediated pathway."

Explants from TSP1 null mice exhibit enhanced neovascularization associated with increased endothelial outgrowth but decreased outgrowth of perivascular smooth muscle cells . The absence of endogenous TSP1 did not diminish activation of latent transforming growth factor-β and moderately decreased matrix metalloproteinase levels. However, significant changes in other secreted proteins were observed. Endogenous TSP1 decreased mRNA levels for collagens Iα1, Iα2, and IIIα1 and laminin α4 and increased collagen IVα1 mRNA expression. Endogenous TSP1 also decreased the level of type I collagen protein produced by the vascular outgrowths. Collagens Iα1, Iα2, and IIIα1 are known tumor endothelial markers, suggesting that TSP1 coordinately regulates a set of extracellular matrix genes that reverse the angiogenic switch. Suppression of collagen Iα1 or Iα2 mRNAs using antisense morpholinos inhibited outgrowth in TSP1 null explants and proliferation of TSP1 null endothelial cells, indicating that type I collagen synthesis is limiting for this neovascularization response."

Microarray analysis revealed overexpression of C/EBPbeta in 25 of 27 (93%) GC when compared to 12 normal gastric tissue samples. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the overexpression of C/EBPbeta transcripts in 54 of 59 (91%) GC. In total, 15 of 18 gastric tumors exhibited at least fivefold higher C/EBPbeta transcript levels compared to their corresponding adjacent normal gastric tissue samples. Moreover, immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated increased nuclear staining of C/EBPbeta in 10 of 13 GC and at least fourfold overexpression of C/EBPbeta in three primary GC compared to adjacent normal gastric tissue. Furthermore, a striking correlation of decreased TFF1 expression with increased C/EBPbeta was observed in the gastric tumors studied. Microarray analysis demonstrated a loss of TFF1 expression in all 27 GC cases examined, of which 25 exhibited high C/EBPbeta expression compared to normal gastric tissue. RT-PCR analysis revealed loss of TFF1 expression in 56 of 59 gastric tumors in which 54 of these tumors exhibited overexpression of C/EBPbeta. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed overexpression of C/EBPbeta in 10 of 13 gastric tumors that exhibited low expression of TFF1 at the protein level. Thus, overexpression of the transcription factor C/EBPbeta in the majority of GCs is a novel finding."

https://openalex.org/W2062477948,"LT-related inducible ligand that competes for glycoprotein D binding to herpesvirus entry mediator on T cells (LIGHT) is a recently cloned type II transmembrane protein belonging to the TNF family that was originally identified as a weak inducer of apoptosis. This cytokine has been extensively defined in its role on T-cell regulation and dendritic cell maturation. However, whether this cytokine regulates stem cell proliferation and/or differentiation remains unknown. In this study, we transduced exogenous LIGHT into embryonic stem cells (ES cells) and found it induced their differentiation. The expression of phospho-STAT3, Nanog and Oct-4 was reduced in LIGHT-transduced ES cells compared with wild-type ES cells. LIGHT-transduced ES cells exhibit a low level of SSEA-1 surface antigen and alkaline phosphatase staining compared with wild-type cells. Introduction of LIGHT into ES cells results in the dephosphorylation of MKP-3 and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)5. When ERK5 was inhibited by the specific inhibitor PD184352 or knocked down by ERK5 siRNA, reduction of Oct-4 and SSEA-1 expression was rescued. We conclude that LIGHT overrides Leukemia inhibitory factor to induce ES cell differentiation associated with activation of ERK5."

Active gamma-secretase is a tetrameric protein complex consisting of presenilin-1 (or -2), nicastrin, PEN-2, and Aph-1a (or -1b). We have recently discovered that pharmacogenetically bred apomorphine-susceptible Wistar rats (APO-SUS) have only one or two copies of the Aph-1b gene (termed I/I and II/II rats, respectively), whereas their phenotypic counterparts (APO-UNSUS) have three copies (III/III). As a result, APO-SUS rats display reduced Aph-1b expression and a complex phenotype reminiscent of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we determined in the I/I and III/III rats the gamma-secretase cleavage activity toward the three APP superfamily members, p75 neurotrophin receptor, ErbB4, and neuregulin-2, and found that the cleavage of only a subset of the substrates was changed. Furthermore, the observed differences were restricted to tissues that normally express relatively high Aph-1b compared with Aph-1a levels. Thus, we provide in vivo evidence that subtle alterations in gamma-secretase subunit composition may lead to a variety of affected (neuro)developmental signaling pathways and, consequently, a complex phenotype."

Here, we demonstrate that pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is a linear and reversible inhibitor of ACC-1 and ACC-2. ACC from rat liver and white adipose tissue (largely ACC-1) exhibited an IC<sub>50</sub> of ∼200 μm, whereas ACC-2 from heart or skeletal muscle exhibited an IC<sub>50</sub> exceeding 500 μm. ACC from rat liver was equally sensitive to PLP following extensive purification by avidin affinity chromatography. When added before citrate, PLP inhibited ACC with a <i>K<sub>i</sub></i> of ∼100 μm, reducing maximal activity >90% and increasing the <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> for citrate ∼5-fold but having little effect on substrate <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> values. Pre-treatment with citrate increased the apparent <i>K<sub>i</sub></i> for ACC inhibition by PLP by ∼4-fold. Inhibition of ACC was reversed by removal of PLP, either by washing or by reaction with hydroxylamine or amino-oxyacetate. ACC was irreversibly inhibited and radiolabeled, to a stoichiometry of ∼0.4 mol[H]/mol subunit, in the presence of PLP plus [<sup>3</sup>H]borohydride. Studies with structurally related compounds demonstrated that the reactive aldehyde and negatively charged substituents of PLP contribute importantly to ACC inhibition. The studies reported here suggest a rationale to develop ACC inhibitors that are not structurally related to the substrates or products of the reaction and an approach to probe the citrate-binding site of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2141411086,"In earlier studies, we demonstrated that excision of the first intron (intron A) from the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) transcript is highly cell type- and developmental stage-specific. The removal of GnRH intron A requires exonic splicing enhancers on exons 3 and 4 (ESE3 and ESE4, respectively). Tra2α,a serine/arginine-rich (SR)-like protein, specifically binds to ESE4, although it requires additional nuclear co-factors for efficient removal of this intron. In the present study, we demonstrate the cooperative action of multiple SR proteins in the regulation of GnRH pre-mRNA splicing. SRp30c specifically binds to both ESE3 and ESE4, whereas 9G8 binds to an element in exon 3 and strongly enhances the excision of GnRH intron A in the presence of minimal amount of other nuclear components. Interestingly, Tra2α can interact with either 9G8 or SRp30c, whereas no interaction between 9G8 and SRp30c is observed. Tra2α has an additive effect on the RNA binding of these proteins. Overexpression or knock-down of these three proteins in cultured cells further suggests their essential role in intron A excision activities, and their presence in GnRH neurons of the mouse preoptic area further strengthens this possibility.

The mammalian GnRH gene consists of four short exons and three intervening introns (1Adelman J.P. Mason A.J. Hayflick J.S. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 2Bond C.T. Hayflick J.S. Seeburg P.H. Adelman J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1257-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In GnRH-producing cells, all three introns can be efficiently excised from the primary transcript (∼4,300 bases), resulting in a mature mRNA consisting of ∼560 bases (1Adelman J.P. Mason A.J. Hayflick J.S. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). A majority of GnRH-producing neurons reside in the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus. GnRH transcripts, however, are also found in extrahypothalamic areas of the brain and in a variety of peripheral tissues. Interestingly, a greater portion of GnRH transcripts contain the first intron (intron A) in these tissues (3Seong J.Y. Park S. Kim K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1882-1895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that intron A, in contrast to introns B and C, could not be easily removed because of its suboptimal 3′ splice site (3Seong J.Y. Park S. Kim K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1882-1895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Han J. Seong J.Y. Kim K. Wuttke W. Jarry H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 173: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Moreover, we also recently clarified that the presence of tandem repeats of the ATG sequence and putative upstream open reading frames within intron A completely blocked the translation initiation of downstream GnRH coding region in the intron A-retained GnRH transcripts (5Son G.H.

Hence, precise and efficient removal of intron A is likely to play a crucial role in cell type-specific GnRH gene regulation, and it is of importance to elucidate how intron A of the GnRH primary transcript overcomes such intrinsic defects for production of a mature mRNA in GnRH-producing neurons. gonadotropin-releasing hormone serine/arginine-rich exonic splicing enhancer preoptic area nuclear extract glutathione S-transferase reverse transcription electrophoretic mobility shift assay(s) binding domain antisense oligodeoxynucleotide(s) control phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein. In general, the sequences specifying a splice site are weakly conserved and often surrounded by many cryptic splice sites that cannot be detected by a basic splicing system. Moreover, many pre-mRNAs in metazoan cells contain weak or alternative splice sites that must be recognized in a regulated fashion to generate specific mRNA species (6Wang J. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional cis-elements within a pre-mRNA could be important for a precise recognition of the splice site. One form of these elements is the exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), which usually consists of a purine-rich sequence. In this context, we previously demonstrated the presence of functional ESEs on GnRH exons 3 and 4, denoted as ESE3 and ESE4, respectively (3Seong J.Y. Park S. Kim K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1882-1895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Han J. Seong J.Y. Kim K. Wuttke W. Jarry H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 173: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We also showed the physiological significance of the ESEs in intron A excision using the hypogonadal mouse, a native mutant lacking both exons 3 and 4 of the GnRH gene (7Seong J.Y. Kim B.W. Park S. Son G.H. Kim K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because ESEs are essential for alternative splicing, it is easily postulated that the presence of trans-acting splicing factor(s) acting on ESE3 and ESE4 might be prerequisite for producing mature GnRH mRNA in GnRH neurons. Indeed, the addition of nuclear extract (NE) from immortalized GnRH-producing GT1–1 cells efficiently enhanced the excision rate of GnRH intron A in an ESEs-dependent manner, whereas NE from non-GnRH-producing cells failed to do so (8Seong J.Y. Han J. Park S. Wuttke W. Jarry H. Kim K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2426-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The most probable trans-acting factors are a family of proteins containing a conserved domain rich in alternating arginine and serine residues. The serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins and their related members have a modular structure composed of an RNA recognition motif and a conserved domain rich in alternating arginine and serine residues (9Graveley B.R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). SR proteins are known to play an important role in the regulation of both constitutive and enhancer-dependent alternative RNA splicing (10Tian M. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1703-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 11Liu H.X. Zhang M. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 12Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1705-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). They appear to be functionally redundant in constitutive RNA splicing and thus can complement each other. It is, however, observed that individual SR proteins have their own functions in the regulation of tissue- and developmental stage-specific alternative RNA splicing (13Peng X. Mount S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6273-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Hoffman B.E. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because our previous studies showed that a subset of SR proteins was highly enriched in GT1 NE, we prepared several kinds of recombinant SR and SR-like proteins (8Seong J.Y. Han J. Park S. Wuttke W. Jarry H. Kim K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2426-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Using an in vitro RNA-protein binding assay and subsequent functional studies with these recombinant proteins, we clarified that Tra2α, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila transformer-2 (Tra2) (15Dauwalder B. Amaya-Manzanares F. Mattox W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9004-9009Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) specifically binds to GnRH ESE4 (8Seong J.Y. Han J. Park S. Wuttke W. Jarry H. Kim K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2426-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The fact that Tra2α effectively promotes the splicing of GnRH intron A only in the presence of nuclear components such as HeLa NE or an SR protein-enriched fraction suggests a requirement of additional nuclear co-factors for efficient splicing of intron A. Moreover, a protein fraction precipitated in the presence of 40–50% ammonium sulfate (ASP40–50) from GT1 NE elicits the strongest intron A removing activity, although this fraction does not have ESE4-binding proteins (8Seong J.Y. Han J. Park S. Wuttke W. Jarry H. Kim K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2426-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These intriguing findings promoted us to identify additional SR proteins involved in GnRH pre-mRNA splicing. In this study, we demonstrate cooperative interactions among the trans-acting SR proteins Tra2α, 9G8, and SRp30c in ESE-dependent GnRH pre-mRNA splicing.

Plasmids—The reporter DNAs for in vitro splicing assays (p1ΔA234, p1ΔAcc34, and p1ΔAcs4) and template constructs for ESE3 and ESE4 (pESE3 and pESE4) were described in previous reports (4Han J. Seong J.Y. Kim K. Wuttke W. Jarry H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 173: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 8Seong J.Y. Han J. Park S. Wuttke W. Jarry H. Kim K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2426-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). DNA constructs for binding assays were obtained by PCR using p1ΔA234 as a template and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI; denoted as pIAE2, pE3, pE4, pE34, pE3A, pE3B, pE3C, pE3D, and pE34). As a reporter plasmid used for in vivo splicing assays, GnRH 1A234 DNA was obtained by RT-PCR from mouse hypothalamic RNA with E1-up and E4-dn primers and cloned into the pEGFP-N1 (BD Bioscience), thus generating p1A234-GFP. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was carried out as previously described (8Seong J.Y. Han J. Park S. Wuttke W. Jarry H. Kim K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2426-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). RNA-protein binding reaction was performed in a 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 0.4 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 3 mm MgCl2, 20 units of ribonuclease inhibitor (RNAsin), 5 μg yeast tRNA, 32P-labeled RNA probe and the indicated GST-SR recombinant protein for 30 min at 30 °C. In case of supershift and competition experiments, 200 ng of anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 200-fold molar excess cold competitor was added and incubated for another 30 min. After incubation, 6 μl of glycerol was added to each reaction mixture, which was immediately separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Thereafter, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film (Fuji) at -70 °C for 1 day. In Vitro Splicing Assay—The in vitro splicing reactions were performed as described previously (3Seong J.Y. Park S. Kim K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1882-1895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the gel-purified radiolabeled RNA substrates produced by in vitro transcription was subjected to the splicing reaction in 25 μl of reaction mixture containing 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20 mm creatine phosphate, 0.4 mm ATP, 0.6% polyvinylalcohol, 3 mm MgCl2, and 20 units of RNAsin supplemented with 50 μg of HeLa NE or cytoplasmic S100 extract at 30 °C for 2 h. After phenol/chloroform extraction and subsequent ethanol precipitation, the RNAs were separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. UV Cross-linking Assay—RNA-protein binding reaction was performed in a reaction mixture with 0.4 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 3 mm MgCl2, 20 units of RNAsin, 5 μg of yeast tRNA, 32P-labeled RNA probe, and purified proteins for 30 min at 30 °C according to a previously described method with minor modifications (8Seong J.Y. Han J. Park S. Wuttke W. Jarry H. Kim K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2426-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). UV cross-linking was performed on ice, 4.5 cm away from a UV source at 1.2 J (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each sample was then incubated with 200 units of RNase T1 and 200 units of RNase A for 10 min at 37 °C. The resulting RNA-protein complexes were denatured and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and autoradiographed at -70 °C for 1 day. GST Pull-down Assay—Tra2α, 9G8, and SRp30c were subcloned into pCMV-Tag3 (Stratagene) for expression as Myc-tagged forms. The expression vector for Myc-Tra2α, Myc-9G8, or Myc-SRp30c was transfected into CHO-K1 cells using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were lysed with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 10 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Cleared cell lysates were treated with RNase A (0.5 mg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C. RNase-treated samples were then incubated with 5 μg of purified GST, GST-Tra2α, GST-9G8, or GST-SRp30c protein for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by pull-down with Glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). After three washes with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, pulled-down protein complexes were subjected to Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—For immunoblotting, proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 10% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) with 0.3% Tween 20 (TBS-T), primary antibody (both anti-Myc and anti-GST were used at a final dilution of 1:4000) was applied to the membrane and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, the blots were washed four times with TBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h. After four washes with TBS-T, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by Amersham Biosciences ECL reagents following the provided instructions. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The full-length cDNA fragments for mouse Tra2α, 9G8, and SRp30c were fused in-frame to the DNA-binding domain (BD) of pBD-GAL4 (Stratagene) and the activation domain of the pACT2 vector (BD Bioscience). Transformants of Y187 strain yeast cells expressing Tra2α-BD, 9G8-BD, or SRp30c-BD plasmid were mated to a set of AH109 strain colonies, which expressed Tra2α, 9G8, or SRp30c fused to the Gal4 activation domain according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting diploids were selected by cultivation at 30 °C for 6–12 days on minimal synthetic dropout medium lacking Trp, Leu, His, and Ade but including 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Total RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Hybridization—RNA isolation and Northern blot hybridization were performed as described previously with minor modifications (3Seong J.Y. Park S. Kim K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1882-1895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated by a single step acid-guanidinium-phenol-chloroform extraction method. Twenty μg of total RNA was denatured, resolved on 1.2% formaldehyde denaturing agarose gels, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The resulting membranes were prehybridized at 42 °C for 2 h and then hybridized for 16–24 h with cDNA probes for Tra2α, 9G8, and SRp30c. After autoradiography, the membranes were stripped and rehybridized with a cDNA probe for 18 S rRNA to ensure equal amounts of loading of RNA samples. RT-PCR for in Vivo Splicing Assay—NIH3T3 or GT1–1 cells were transiently transfected with 10 ng of reporter plasmids p1A234-GFP expressing pre-mRNA substrates. NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with the indicated Myc-tagged SR protein-expressing plasmids. GT1–1 cells were simultaneously transfected with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODN) with the reporter construct. Total RNAs were prepared from the transfected cells and treated with 10 units of DNase (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37°C to avoid possible DNA contamination. DNase-treated RNAs were reverse-transcribed using a commercial reverse transcription kit (Promega), and the resulting cDNA was amplified with E1-up, IA-up, and GFP-dn primers by PCR as previously described (8Seong J.Y. Han J. Park S. Wuttke W. Jarry H. Kim K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2426-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Sequences for AS-ODNs are as follows: CTL-ODN (no homology with any mouse genes in GenBank™) (16Kim M.S. Hur M.K. Son Y.J. Park J.I. Chun S.Y. D'Elia A.V. Damante G. Cho S. Kim K. Lee B.J. J. Biol.

Immunohistochemical Analysis—Male mice (ICR, 15 weeks of age) were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the brains were post-fixed in the same solution for 24 h. The brains were then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and sectioned (40 μm); subsequent immunostaining was performed by the free floating method. Brain sections containing POA were washed with PBS and blocked with 5% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. The following primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4 °C: anti-GnRH, 1:1000; anti-Tra2, 1:1000; anti-9G8, 1:100; and anti-SRp30c, 1:3000. After six washes with PBS, the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescent dyes (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were applied for 30 min. Subsequently the sections were washed, mounted, and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Statistics—The splicing efficiencies (ratio of spliced product to unspliced substrate) observed in in vitro and in vivo splicing assays were statistically evaluated by Student's t test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. SRp30c Directly Binds Both ESE3 and ESE4 and Enhances Intron A Excision—The recognition of a suboptimal splice site by the 3′ spliceosome complex can be enhanced by the help of ESEs and their trans-acting partners (10Tian M. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1703-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17Tanaka K. Watakabe A. Shimura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Several SR proteins and their related members are known to regulate the excision of either weak or strong introns by direct interaction with ESEs (18Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6431-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lynch K.W. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2089-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 20Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). In an earlier study, we demonstrated that Tra2α is involved in the enhanced excision of GnRH intron A by a direct interaction with ESE4. This enhanced splicing activity, however, requires additional nuclear components (8Seong J.Y. Han J. Park S. Wuttke W. Jarry H. Kim K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2426-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, the question of what additional SR proteins are required can be asked. To approach this question, we examined the interaction between ESEs and purified GST-tagged recombinant SR proteins. EMSA revealed that only SRp30c of six tested SR proteins was able to bind both ESE3 and ESE4, whereas Tra2α bound only ESE4 (Fig. 1, A and B). Anti-GST antibody-evoked supershift in EMSA further confirms these specific bindings (Fig. 1C). Binding of SRp30c with a radiolabeled ESE3 RNA probe was inhibited by both 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled ESE3 and ESE4 RNA and vice versa (Fig. 1D), suggesting that SRp30c might recognize both ESEs via the same RNA-binding domain. SRp30c, in addition to its binding activities, apparently enhanced GnRH pre-mRNA splicing in the HeLa NE-supplemented in vitro splicing assay system. This intron A removing activity is comparable with that of Tra2α (Fig. 1E). 9G8 Complements S100 Fraction to Remove Intron A—One of the important features of SR proteins is that they can complement splicing-deficient cytoplasmic S100 extract, which lacks SR proteins but does contain minimal amounts of essential splicing factors for constitutive RNA splicing including snRNPs, hnRNPs, and debranching enzymes (21Fu X.D. Mayeda A. Maniatis T. Krainer A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11224-11228Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 22Popielarz M. Cavaloc Y. Mattei M.G. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17830-17835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We next compared intron A removal abilities of purified SR proteins in the presence of cytoplasmic S100 extract using three different splicing reporter constructs (Fig. 2A). 9G8 exhibited an apparent S100 complementing activity on 1ΔA234 and 1ΔAcc34 in a dose-dependent manner when compared with those of other SR proteins; it had, however, a negligible intron A removing activity for the 1ΔAcs4 construct lacking exons 2 and 3 (Fig. 2, B and C), suggesting that 9G8 enhances excision of intron A by an interaction with exon 3 but not exon 4. In addition to 9G8, SRp55 exerted a weak S100 complementation activity. However, we only focused on 9G8 in the present study, because SRp55 could not bind to GnRH pre-mRNA, and the functional relevance of this protein in GnRH-producing cells was negligible (data not shown). The fact that 9G8 did not bind to either ESE3 nor ESE4 suggests an additional binding site(s) for it in the exonic sequence. To address this possibility, we employed RNA probes, such as exon 2 with the distal region of intron A (IAE2), and all of exon 3 with ESE3 (E3) and exon 4 (E4) for RNA-protein binding assays with purified GST-9G8 (Fig. 3A). 9G8 bound to the E3 RNA probe only in the presence of S100 extract (Fig. 3B). To find the exact binding site of 9G8 in exon 3, we designed several truncated exon 3 RNA probes (E3A–E3D) as shown in Fig. 3A; E3A and E3D probes bound to 9G8, indicating that it interacted with the distal region of exon 3 by the help of a certain factor(s) in cytoplasmic S100 extract (Fig. 3C). Protein-Protein Interactions between Tra2α, 9G8, and SRp30c—Specific protein-protein interactions among SR proteins are known to be important for functional spliceosome formation (19Lynch K.W. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2089-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 23Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9243-9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These interactions may lead to the recruitment and stabilization of essential splicing factors on the splice site (20Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Because Tra2α, 9G8, and SRp30c contact GnRH pre-mRNA, the molecular interactions between these SR proteins were examined using GST pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays. Cell extracts from CHO-K1 cells expressing Myc-tagged Tra2α, 9G8, or SRp30c were pulled down with purified GST-tagged Tra2α, 9G8, SRp30c, or GST after treatment with RNase to avoid a possible bridging effect of RNA substrates. Subsequent immunoblot analyses revealed that GST-Tra2α interacted with all of the three Myc-tagged SR proteins and vice versa (Fig. 4A). Yeast two-hybrid assays confirmed direct interactions of Tra2α with 9G8 and SRp30c. Further, Tra2α showed a strong self-interaction, indicating putative dimerization or oligomerization of this protein on its substrates (Fig. 4B). However, 9G8 and SRp30c did not interact with each other, and neither of them elicited self-interactions. Cooperative Actions of Tra2α with 9G8 and SRp30c on Cis-element Binding and GnRH Pre-mRNA Splicing in Vitro—Because Tra2α strongly interacts with 9G8 and SRp30c, we used a UV cross-linking assay to determine whether such physical interactions promote the binding of 9G8 and SRp30c on their target cis-element. The RNA probes E3D, ESE4, and E34, which contains the distal region of exon 3, and ESE4 were used (Fig. 5A). 9G8 bound to E34 and E3D RNA probes in the presence of the S100 extract and/or Tra2α. Interestingly, the presence of both S100 extract and Tra2α greatly enhanced the cross-linking of 9G8 to the E34 and E3D probes. Binding of 9G8 to E34 in the presence of Tra2α (Fig. 5A, the fourth and eighth lanes of the top panel) suggests that Tra2α promotes 9G8 to recognize its binding site, presumably through direct protein-protein interaction. Both Tra2α and SRp30c bind to ESE4, raising the possibility that the interaction between these proteins affects their recognition and binding activities with ESE4. We tested this possibility using ESE3 and ESE4 RNA probes. Increasing SRp30c concentrations with a constant amount of Tra2α enhanced the binding activity of Tra2α to the ESE4 probe and vice versa (Fig. 5B, top panels). For ESE3, however, Tra2α did not exert any influence on the binding activity of SRp30c (Fig. 5B, bottom panels). This finding suggests a synergistic effect of Tra2α and SRp30c on ESE4 binding activity through a direct interaction between these two proteins. Whether this cooperative binding influences excision of intron A was examined using in vitro RNA splicing assays. Increasing the amount of Tra2α greatly enhanced 9G8-evoked splicing of the 1ΔA234 reporter in a dose-dependent manner. Because 9G8 complements S100 extract and exhibits a strong intron A removing activity, it was expected that increasing 9G8 concentration would enhance the splicing of 1ΔA234 (Fig. 5C, top panels). The synergistic effect of Tra2α and SRp30c was, however, negligible, likely because of their inability to complement the cytoplasmic S100 extract (Fig. 5C, bottom panels). Tra2α, 9G8, and SRp30c Promote the Removal of Intron A in Vivo—To examine the role of SR proteins in the excision of mouse GnRH intron A in vivo, we adopted a competitive RT-PCR analysis with three primers as described previously (7Seong J.Y. Kim B.W. Park S. Son G.H. Kim K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To distinguish the RNA species of the transfected reporter construct from endogenous GnRH transcripts, we used a GFP-tagged mouse GnRH intron"
https://openalex.org/W2121683284,"The Brn-3a POU family transcription factor is overexpressed in human cervical carcinoma biopsies and is able to activate expression of the human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV-16) upstream regulatory region (URR), which drives the expression of the E6 and E7 oncoproteins. Inhibition of Brn-3a expression in human cervical cancer cells inhibits HPV gene expression and reduces cellular growth and anchorage independence in vitro as well as the ability to form tumours in vivo. Here, we show that Brn-3a differentially regulates different HPV-16 variants that have previously been shown to be associated with different risks of progression to cervical carcinoma. In human cervical material, Brn-3a levels correlate directly with HPV E6 levels in individuals infected with a high risk variant of HPV-16, whereas this is not the case for a low-risk variant. Moreover, the URRs of high- and intermediate-risk variants are activated by Brn-3a in transfection assays, whereas the URR of a low-risk variant is not. The change of one or two bases in a low-risk variant URR to their equivalent in a higher-risk URR can render the URR responsive to Brn-3a and vice versa. These results help explain why the specific interplay between viral and cellular factors necessary for the progression to cervical carcinoma only occurs in a minority of those infected with HPV-16."
