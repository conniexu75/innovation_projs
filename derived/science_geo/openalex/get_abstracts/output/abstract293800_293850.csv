https://openalex.org/W1978488084,"Comparative geology suggests that the continents adjacent to northern, western, southern, and eastern Laurentia in the Late Proterozoic were Siberia, Australia-Antarctica, southern Africa, and Amazonia-Baltica, respectively. Late Proterozoic fragmentation of the supercontinent centered on Laurentia would then have been followed by rapid fan-like collapse of the (present) southern continents and eventual consolidation of East and West Gondwanaland. In this scenario, a pole of rotation near the Weddell Sea would explain the observed dominance of wrench tectonics in (present) east-west trending Pan-African mobile belts and subduction-accretion tectonics in north-south trending belts. In the process of fragmentation, rifts originating in the interior of the Late Proterozoic supercontinent became the external margins of Paleozoic Gondwanaland; exterior margins of the Late Proterozoic supercontinent became landlocked within the interior of Gondwanaland."

The critical temperature could not be estimated as it exceeds 350 kelvin, the thermal decomposition temperature of the sample. The empirical composition of the reported material is V(TCNE)x.Y(CH(2)Cl(2)) with x approximately 2 and Y approximately 1/2. On the basis of the available magnetic and infrared data, threedimensional antiferromagnetic exchange of the donor and acceptor spins resulting in ferrimagnetic behavior appears to be the mode of magnetic coupling."
https://openalex.org/W2045462482,"Permeabilities for a series of gases through free-standing films of the conjugated polymer polyaniline are reported. A remarkable selectivity has been achieved for important gas pairs incuding hydrogen-nitrogen, oxygen-nitrogen, and carbon dioxide-methane. The selectivity values of 3590 for H(2)/N(2), 30 for O(2)/N(2), and 336 for CO(2)/CH(4) surpass the highest previously reported values of 313, 16, and 60 for the nonconjugated polymers poly(trifluorochloroethylene), cellulose nitrate, and a fluorinated polyimide, respectively. The process for tailoring gas selectivity of a polyaniline membrane involves first enhancing the permeabilities of gases with small diameters [<3.5 angstroms (A)] by doping and undoping the polymer film with counterions of an appropriate size. High selectivities are then achieved by decreasing the permeabilities of larger gases (>3.5 A diameter) through controlled redoping of the polymer. The permanent morphological changes induced in this conjugated polymer system and others indicate the potential for development of universal membranes for gas separations."
https://openalex.org/W2002200571,"The recent report of electrical conductivity in the alkali metal fullerides and the discovery of superconductivity at 18 K for KxC60 has raised fundamental questions about the electronic states on either side of the Fermi level, their occupancy with K intercalation, and the mechanism of superconductivity. Direct photoemission evidence is presented of filling of bands derived from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital as a function of K incorporation for the metallic and insulating phases. This filling is not rigid band-like, and it reflects disorder in the K sites. Theoretical analysis indicates that KxC60 is a strong coupling superconductor, and we suggest that the enhanced electron-phonon interaction is related to the unique hybridization of the C sp-derived states."
https://openalex.org/W1966677811,"Photoemission spectra of vacuum deposited layers of C(60), before and after exposure to K vapor, show that the K donates its conduction electron into the band derived from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. A compound with composition of K(3)C(60), corresponding to the maximum conductivity, has been prepared. In it the potassium atoms presumably occupy both the octahedral and the two tetrahedral interstitial sites of the face-centered-cubic (fcc) C(60) structure."
https://openalex.org/W2027076693,"By means of controlled collisions of atoms and molecules with liquid surfaces, molecular beam experiments can be used to probe how gases stick to, rebound from, and exchange energy with molecules in the liquid phase. This report describes measurements of energy exchange in collisions between gases (neon, xenon, and sulfur hexafluoride) and polyatomic liquids (squalane and perfluoropolyether). Energy transfer depends critically on liquid composition and is more efficient for the hydrocarbon than for the perfluorinated ether."
https://openalex.org/W2087295880,The discovery of copper sulfides in carbon dioxide- and chlorine-bearing bubbles in phenocryst-hosted melt inclusions shows that copper resides in a vapor phase in some shallow magma chambers. Copper is several hundred times more concentrated in magmatic vapor than in coexisting pantellerite melt. The volatile behavior of copper should be considered when modeling the volcanogenic contribution of metals to the atmosphere and may be important in the formation of copper porphyry ore deposits.
https://openalex.org/W2031612305,"Echoes from the near-Earth object 1986 DA show it to be significantly more reflective than other radar-detected asteroids. This result supports the hypothesis that 1986 DA is a piece of NiFe metal derived from the interior of a much larger object that melted, differentiated, cooled, and subsequently was disrupted in a catastrophic collision. This 2-kilometer asteroid, which appears smooth at centimeter to meter scales but extremely irregular at 10- to 100-meter scales, might be (or have been a part of the parent body of some iron meteorites."
