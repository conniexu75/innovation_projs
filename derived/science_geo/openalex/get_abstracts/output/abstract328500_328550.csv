https://openalex.org/W4236860458,"Piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity, traditionally encountered in certain single crystals and ceramics, have now also been documented in a number of polymers. Recently, one such polymer-poly(vinylidene fluoride)-and some of its copolymers have been shown to be ferroelectric as well. The extraordinary molecular and supermolecular structural requirements for ferroelectric behavior in polymers are discussed in detail, with particular emphasis on poly(vinylidene fluoride). Piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric properties are also briefly reviewed, as are some promising applications of such polymers."
https://openalex.org/W1979515153,"During a cruise from Hamburg to Montevideo, aerosol samples representing air masses from Europe, the Sahara, tropical Africa, South America, and open oceanic regions were collected. They showed significant amounts of soot carbon over large areas of the remote Atlantic, often similar to concentrations in rural continental areas. Back-trajectories and the ratios of soot carbon to total fine (less than 1.7 micrometers in diameter) carbon and of excess fine potassium (the portion not attributable to soil dust or sea salt) to soot carbon indicate that biomass burning in tropical regions is an important source of soot carbon to the world atmosphere. The ratio of excess potassium to soot carbon in the fine fraction of aerosols is proposed as an indicator of the relative contributions of biomass and fossil-fuel burning to soot carbon aerosols. The ratio of soot carbon to fine carbon suggests that most of the particulate organic carbon over the Atlantic is of continental origin."

At least two classes of enzymes, the C(chi)-cellulases and the xylanases, are not produced by the larvae. Instead, larvae acquire these enzymes while ingesting tissue of Amylostereum chailletii, the fungal symbiont that occurs in the wood on which the larvae feed."

The trace element composition and geographical distribution of these spheres suggest that they are from the 30 June 1908 Tunguska explosion and not meteoritic ablation products falling continuously on the earth. Debris from this explosion was also discovered in a South Pole ice core; this discovery indicates that the Tunguska object exploded in the atmosphere with subsequent stratospheric injection and transport of the debris. The celestial body that exploded over Tunguska weighed more than 7 million tons, was more than 0.16 kilometer in diameter, and may well have been a stony meteorite. This discovery offers a new precision time marker in polar ice strata for the year 1909. The steady-state influx of cosmic matter at the South Pole is estimated to be 1.8 x 10(-8) grams per square centimeter per year, which corresponds to a global influx of 4 x l0(5) tons per year."
https://openalex.org/W2029235404,"The association between climatic anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean, often called El Niño events, and annual corn production in the United States was investigated. Temperature and atmospheric pressure in parts of the United States have been correlated with El Niño events. This research suggests that in years in which an El Niño event causes surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific to become warmer than normal, there is a higher probability of an above-average corn crop in the United States. For years when sea surface temperatures are average or cool, no significant association is observed."
https://openalex.org/W1990225883,Thermal gradient experiments in sediment-seawater systems revealed large-scale fluxes of aqueous electrolytic components away from the heat source through thermal diffusion. These findings indicate a need for similar studies in other geological materials of low permeability in order to assess the implications of this phenomenon for various nuclear waste disposal options.
https://openalex.org/W2091834651,"Teeth of a North American ictidosaur, Pachygenelus milleri, n. sp., found in the Upper Triassic Dockum Group of Texas, indicate that it is very similar to Pachygenelus monus of South Africa and Chaliminia musteloides of South America. The presence of a Gondwana element in the Northern Hemisphere attests to the ease of dispersal of the Late Triassic vertebrates through Pangea. Ictidosaurs are small, highly advanced, carnivorous cynodonts that display a mosaic of reptilian and mammalian features in the masticatory apparatus. They were contemporaneous with early mammals and probably closely related to them."
https://openalex.org/W2058177640,"Long-term U.S. economic growth requires better use of R & D resources and closer interaction of the academic, government, and industrial research communities. The federal government has proposed to increase support for university research as a key means of addressing national needs for new knowledge in fields important to industrial development and for training of technical personnel. But continuing growth in support for basic research depends on how well the science community can agree on what research investments will have the greatest impact in producing new knowledge."

These data invalidate published suggestions that the age is much younger. The pitchstone is not extrusive in its present position but instead is in a volcanic pipe with other fragments that came downward from as much as 1100 meters above the modern surface."
