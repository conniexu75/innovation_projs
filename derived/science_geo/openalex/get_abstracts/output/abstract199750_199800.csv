https://openalex.org/W1595767019,"The absorption of palmitic acid-1-C/sup 14/ by ascites tumor cells was studied in vitro. Palmitate was metabolized more rapidly from its albumin complex than from buffer alone, but the albumin carrier was not absorbed or metabolized. Cyanide-inhibited cells absorbed palmitate from ihe medium but did noi metabolize it. The process of absorption was thus revealed as a distribution of fatty acid between the medium and the inert cell surface probably followed by an active transfer of the fatty acid into the cell for oxidation.

The proenzyme contained about 70 to 80 per cent of a single sedimenting component. Preparations of plasmin were qualitatively similar, although some preparations showed an additional slow peak. By electrophoretic examination, the pro- enzyme revealed a double boundary at low pH, but plasmin showed a single peak. 2. The molecular weight for plasminogen was found to be 143,000, based on a sedimentation constant of 4.28 S - 0.41~ and a diffusion constant of 2.92 X low7 cm.2 sec.+. A molecular weight of 108,000 was estimated for glycerol-activated plasmin, based on a sedimentation constant of 3.56 S - 0.74~. The sedi- mentation rates and the probable molecular weights of strepto- kinase-activated and urokinase-activated plasmins are inter- mediate between these values. 3. The molecular asymmetry of plasminogen was indicated as 8, according to the intrinsic viscosity of 0.08; a higher asym- metry, 22, was calculated from the frictional ratio."

https://openalex.org/W187793632,"MacNutt (I) was the first to demonstrate the presence of an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of the deosyribosyl radical of deoxyribonucleosides to purines and pyrimidines in extracts of three bacterial species that require deoxyribonucleosides for growth. In addition, the presence of a deoxyribonucleoside hydrolase was noted in Lactobacillus helveticus extracts. The reaction products were identified by chromatographic methods and microbiological assays; Kalckar et al. (2) verified the transfer nature of the reaction with the aid of U4-adenine. Hoffmann (3) and Lampen (4) have reported briefly on similar enzymes in Escherichia coli. The present paper describes some of the properties of a partly purified enzyme from L. helveticus extracts which we call “transN-deoxyribosylase” (MacNutt (I) named the enzyme “transN-glycosidase”). Auxiliary enzymes have been used to detect and determine the products of the reaction."

This increase has been explained by recent enzymatic studies demonstrating that the first step in the metabolism of formimino+glutamic acid is the transfer of the formimino group to tetrahydrofolic acid (7-9). Formimino-n-glutamic acid is an intermediate in histidine metabolism (10, 11)) and the urinary excretion of this compound in folic acid deficiency can be increased by the administration of n-histidine (3). Experiments with N16-labeled histidine demonstrated that the urinary formimino-n-glutamic acid was derived from histidine (3). In the present work we have demonstrated that, in addition to formimino-n-glutamic acid, there is a large increase in the excretion of formic acid in the urine of folic acid-deficient rats; in contrast to the results with formiminoglutamic acid, this formic acid is not derived from histidine. Our current studies have been facilitated by the recent development of sensitive spectrophotometric methods for the determination of formic acid (12) and formiminoglutamic acid (13). EXPERIMENTAL"

https://openalex.org/W76481053,"Galactosyl oligosaccharides are produced from lactose by enzyme preparations from yeasts, molds, and bacteria (1, 2). It has been suggested that these compounds are synthesized via a transgalactosylation mechanism in which galactosyl units of lactose are transferred to accepting or cosubstrate molecules (3-5). That the transferring enzyme of Saccharomyces jragilis acts by the transgalactosylation mechanism has now been verified. In addition, a number of saccharides have been tested as cosubstrates for the enzyme with a view to determining its cosubstrate specificity. The latter experiments have resulted in the preparation of several new oligosaccharides."
